Foreign interests noticed several key benefits of operating in China, including the vast market, availability of cheap labor and raw materials, longer work hours, and lower transport costs. The first foreign enterprises were established immediately after the Sino-Japanese War of 1904-05, within a few years of the first Chinese factories. Due to the treaty ending the war, foreign entities were able to operate exempt from tariff duties and with fewer political restrictions than native companies. The British came first, but the Japanese arrived soon after.<ref name=\":2\">Shepherd, Jack. \u201cSalvaging the Textile Industry in China.\u201d ''Far Eastern Survey'' 8.15 (1939): 171\u2013175. ''JSTOR''. Web.</ref>\n\n=== Rapid Expansion ===\nSince imports of Western manufactured goods stopped during World War I, the cotton industry in both China and Japan developed rapidly to fill the need in Asia. Initially, all of the machines and accessories were imported from Britain or America. This foreshadowed an industry trend of importing technology and exporting finished goods that describes most of the 20th century.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, in the 1920s, Japan became the main supplier of machines, and some began to be built in China as well, establishing the textile-machine-tools industry which would eventually grow enough in volume to supply neighboring countries as well.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bhatt | first1 = V. M. | year = 1947 | title = China's Cotton Textile Industry | url = | journal = Pacific Affairs | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 309\u2013312 }}</ref>\n\n=== Competition with Japanese Companies ===\nWhile the total capacity of the Chinese mills into the 1930s was greater than that of the Japanese, a third of the cotton yarn and half of the cotton goods produced in China were made by Japanese owned mills.<ref name=\":1\" /> Japanese mills had the advantage of better technology and more capital, while Chinese mills were limited due to management inefficiency, lack of organization, and financial weakness. In particular, the Japanese mills were able to survive the depression in the 1930s because they had stronger and more stable financial backing.<ref name=\":2\" /> Furthermore, in Shandong, which is still industrially important today, the Japanese had the advantage of the significant transportation and utilities infrastructure developed by the Germans when they used the city as a port for trade. When the Japanese arrived in 1914, they were able to use these resources and the local people's knowledge of machinery to very quickly establish seven modern spinning mills. Thanks to the electric power set up by the Germans, they were also able to implement electric powered weaving machines throughout the 1930s to significantly increase the production efficiency of mills.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1934, the National Economic Council of China established the Cotton Industry Commission, meant to improve the quality of Chinese raw cotton and to improve spinning, weaving, and dyeing techniques. However, due to the lack of capital and high outstanding debt of the Chinese mills, production costs were still high. In 1936, Chinese mills began to crop up inland instead of on the coast in an attempt to have more competitive costs and prices. The inland mills allowed them to sit closer to raw materials and the rural weaving markets.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, war suddenly broke out and devastated both the Chinese and Japanese textile industries.\n\n=== Sino-Japanese War ===\nIn July 1937, there were some 2.75 million spindles and 25,500 looms under Chinese ownership. There were 2.38 million spindles and 33,800 looms under Japanese control. Plans had been underway by both camps to expand dramatically, but most were stopped by the outbreak of the war. For comparison, the British controlled some 220,000 spindles and 4,000 looms.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen the fighting started, the Chinese Government commissioned a group to help mill owners move their equipment inland. Areas such as Shantung, Honan, and Wuhan were able to move tons of equipment inland before the Japanese arrived, essentially clearing out existing mills and setting up new ones. However, around Shanghai, the fighting started so suddenly that only the equipment inside the International Settlement survived. Approximately 44% of the Chinese mills were located in and around Shanghai, and as a result, 60 Chinese owned mills possessing about 70% of Chinese-run manufacturing equipment were lost. A large number of small weaving and dyeing workshops were also destroyed. When mills were not entirely destroyed, they were either operated by Japanese companies or transformed into hospitals or military headquarters. Most mills around Shanghai were too badly damaged to get fully running again quickly and were simply transformed to military use, but in the North, mills soon resumed work under the Japanese. However, these Japanese controlled mills were constantly harassed by guerrillas or revolting workers. The Japanese were further hindered by the exhaustion of raw materials, scarcity of labor, and marketing difficulties due to nationalistic conflicts. For example, when they evacuated their Qingdao mills for a few months in late 1937, the mills were in ruins when they returned.<ref name=\":2\" /> Soon the Japanese began to offer a system of \"cooperative management\" to the Chinese mill owners. Under this organization, there would be Japanese management and the Japanese would get 51% of the profits. Meanwhile, all repair costs would be borne by the Chinese. Most owners rejected this system.\n\n==== The Rong Family's Shenxin Mills ====\nThe Rong brothers, Rong Zongjing and Rong Desheng, became the so-called \"cotton and flour kings\" due to their empire of the ten Shenxin [[textile mill]]s and sixteen Maoxin and Fuxin flour mills. By the mid-1930s, the Rongs held almost 20% of spindles in Chinese owned textile mills.<ref name=\":4\">Parks M. Coble. \u201c[http://www.weber.edu/WSUImages/History/Parks%20Coble%202013%20WSU%20talk%20(1).pdf The Historical Roots of Shanghai\u2019s Modern Miracle.]\u201d Asian Studies Lecture Series. Weber State University. 2013.</ref> However, in August 1937, they lost five of their seven Shanghai mills. Two were bombed and taken over by military forces, while the other three fell under Japanese control. The last two surviving mills were in the International Settlement, which was relatively protected from Japanese attacks as a zone of neutrality. While mills were encouraged to move inland and many did, the ones that stayed in Shanghai like the last two Shenxin mills registered as foreign entities for protection. They \"leased\" their mills to foreign owners and hired fake foreign managers so that they could fly a foreign flag. In fact, since the two mills were actually over capacity before the conflict, they operated more efficiently during this period, and one actually expanded and increased output.<ref name=\":6\"/> Even though the industry had taken a big hit, any mills that were not destroyed enjoyed decent profits due to high demand and low supply. This incentivized industrialists who were still in the area to rebuild mills, and they were able to bring the area back up to 40% of prewar production.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen the Pacific War erupted, the International Settlement came under heavy fire, and British or American registration made factories a target. The Japanese took over the Rongs' remaining two mills on the grounds that they were enemy property. However, since the Chinese were no longer Japan's biggest enemy, the military was ready to restore Chinese mills in Shanghai to industrialists willing to work with the occupation. The Japanese opposed returning the mills that they had restored and maintained, especially without a payment in return for all of the rebuilding they had to do. However, the Chinese manufacturers argued that they could more easily operate in the Chinese market and gain access to cotton produced in rural areas. One industrialist also appealed to a Japanese government connection of his who was a strong advocate for Pan-Asianism, and returning the mills to establish good relations was seen as a symbol of the Pan-Asian movement. In return, the industrialists were required to show public support for the Japanese, and many plant managers joined the control organizations of the puppet government.\n\nHowever, Japan still controlled a significant amount of the raw cotton in China, so most of the cotton was either shipped to Japan or given to Japanese mills in China. Due to this lack of cotton, several of the Shenxin mills stopped production while others operated at a fraction of their capacity. The Rongs had to turn to the black market to continue profitable operation. They rented out their equipment to smaller rural workshops that could more easily evade control and tax.<ref name=\":6\"/> Ultimately, this willingness to work with and around the political powers of the time allowed the Rongs to survive, as well as the other prominent mill families of the time.\n\n=== Recovering from War ===\nChina's [[textile industry]] only became dominated by the Chinese after the defeat of Japan in 1945, which gave China ownership of many well-equipped and efficient manufacturing units. However, Chinese management was limited in technical and managerial skill. Furthermore, because of the deterioration with lack of maintenance of many plants during the war, efficiency in 1947 varied between 65-80% of prewar standards. Combined with the loss of spindles due to the destruction of the war, output was only 40% of 1937 output.<ref name=\":3\" /> After Japan's retreat, the Chinese government took over 40 mills and incorporated them into the Chinese Textile Industries Corporation (CTIC), arguing that government management would get the mills running again most quickly. The government wanted the mills to clothe the army and to produce enough profit to reduce the government budget deficit. It also wanted to organize the mills to take over markets formerly supplied by Japan and to alleviate the clothing shortage in China and thus take over the domestic textile market. Ultimately this resulted in the government controlling 50% of China's textile industry. However, one of the actual reasons these mills were more efficient was because the Japanese had maintained the equipment in their mills well during the war. Yet even with easier access to capital, the government made no moves to expand its mills, indicating a lack of desire to invest but rather a desire to reap profits.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nPrivate mills continued to try to grow, but major obstacles included high production costs due to inflation and scarcity of foreign exchange with which to buy raw cotton, machinery, and supplies. The war had wreaked havoc on the land, and the textile machine tool industry which had been prospering was largely lost. Finally, as the Chinese Communist Party rose to power, many mill owners packed their bags and moved their operations to Hong Kong to survive, allowing the next stage of development to take place in Hong Kong.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Economy of China}}\n\n[[Category:Textile industry of China]]\n", "text_old": "The '''textile industry in China''' is the largest in the world in both overall production and exports.<ref name=\"total\">{{cite news |title=Where is China's Textile and Apparel Industry Going?|url=https://cpianalysis.org/2015/07/24/where-is-chinas-textile-and-apparel-industry-going/|publisher=China Policy Institute|date=July 24, 2015}}</ref> [[China]] exported $274 billion in [[textile]]s in 2013, a volume that was nearly seven times that of [[Bangladesh]], the second largest exporter with $40 billion in exports.<ref name=\"TNN\">{{cite web|author1=TNN|title=India overtakes Germany and Italy, is new world No. 2 in textile exports|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/India-overtakes-Germany-and-Italy-is-new-world-No-2-in-textile-exports/articleshow/35973054.cms|work=Times of India|accessdate=2 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050752/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/India-overtakes-Germany-and-Italy-is-new-world-No-2-in-textile-exports/articleshow/35973054.cms|archivedate=30 June 2016|date=3 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> This accounted for 43.1% of global clothing exports.<ref name=\":0\">Carlos Braso Broggi.

Foreign interests noticed several key benefits of operating in China, including the vast market, availability of cheap labor and raw materials, longer work hours, and lower transport costs. The first foreign enterprises were established immediately after the Sino-Japanese War of 1904-05, within a few years of the first Chinese factories. Due to the treaty ending the war, foreign entities were able to operate exempt from tariff duties and with fewer political restrictions than native companies. The British came first, but the Japanese arrived soon after.<ref name=\":2\">Shepherd, Jack. \u201cSalvaging the Textile Industry in China.\u201d ''Far Eastern Survey'' 8.15 (1939): 171\u2013175. ''JSTOR''. Web.</ref>\n\n=== Rapid Expansion ===\nSince imports of Western manufactured goods stopped during World War I, the cotton industry in both China and Japan developed rapidly to fill the need in Asia. Initially, all of the machines and accessories were imported from Britain or America. This foreshadowed an industry trend of importing technology and exporting finished goods that describes most of the 20th century.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, in the 1920s, Japan became the main supplier of machines, and some began to be built in China as well, establishing the textile-machine-tools industry which would eventually grow enough in volume to supply neighboring countries as well.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bhatt | first1 = V. M. | year = 1947 | title = China's Cotton Textile Industry | url = | journal = Pacific Affairs | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 309\u2013312 }}</ref>\n\n=== Competition with Japanese Companies ===\nWhile the total capacity of the Chinese mills into the 1930s was greater than that of the Japanese, a third of the cotton yarn and half of the cotton goods produced in China were made by Japanese owned mills.<ref name=\":1\" /> Japanese mills had the advantage of better technology and more capital, while Chinese mills were limited due to management inefficiency, lack of organization, and financial weakness. In particular, the Japanese mills were able to survive the depression in the 1930s because they had stronger and more stable financial backing.<ref name=\":2\" /> Furthermore, in Shandong, which is still industrially important today, the Japanese had the advantage of the significant transportation and utilities infrastructure developed by the Germans when they used the city as a port for trade. When the Japanese arrived in 1914, they were able to use these resources and the local people's knowledge of machinery to very quickly establish seven modern spinning mills. Thanks to the electric power set up by the Germans, they were also able to implement electric powered weaving machines throughout the 1930s to significantly increase the production efficiency of mills.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1934, the National Economic Council of China established the Cotton Industry Commission, meant to improve the quality of Chinese raw cotton and to improve spinning, weaving, and dyeing techniques. However, due to the lack of capital and high outstanding debt of the Chinese mills, production costs were still high. In 1936, Chinese mills began to crop up inland instead of on the coast in an attempt to have more competitive costs and prices. The inland mills allowed them to sit closer to raw materials and the rural weaving markets.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, war suddenly broke out and devastated both the Chinese and Japanese textile industries.\n\n=== Sino-Japanese War ===\nIn July 1937, there were some 2.75 million spindles and 25,500 looms under Chinese ownership. There were 2.38 million spindles and 33,800 looms under Japanese control. Plans had been underway by both camps to expand dramatically, but most were stopped by the outbreak of the war. For comparison, the British controlled some 220,000 spindles and 4,000 looms.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen the fighting started, the Chinese Government commissioned a group to help mill owners move their equipment inland. Areas such as Shantung, Honan, and Wuhan were able to move tons of equipment inland before the Japanese arrived, essentially clearing out existing mills and setting up new ones. However, around Shanghai, the fighting started so suddenly that only the equipment inside the International Settlement survived. Approximately 44% of the Chinese mills were located in and around Shanghai, and as a result, 60 Chinese owned mills possessing about 70% of Chinese-run manufacturing equipment were lost. A large number of small weaving and dyeing workshops were also destroyed. When mills were not entirely destroyed, they were either operated by Japanese companies or transformed into hospitals or military headquarters. Most mills around Shanghai were too badly damaged to get fully running again quickly and were simply transformed to military use, but in the North, mills soon resumed work under the Japanese. However, these Japanese controlled mills were constantly harassed by guerrillas or revolting workers. The Japanese were further hindered by the exhaustion of raw materials, scarcity of labor, and marketing difficulties due to nationalistic conflicts. For example, when they evacuated their Qingdao mills for a few months in late 1937, the mills were in ruins when they returned.<ref name=\":2\" /> Soon the Japanese began to offer a system of \"cooperative management\" to the Chinese mill owners. Under this organization, there would be Japanese management and the Japanese would get 51% of the profits. Meanwhile, all repair costs would be borne by the Chinese. Most owners rejected this system.\n\n==== The Rong Family's Shenxin Mills ====\nThe Rong brothers, Rong Zongjing and Rong Desheng, became the so-called \"cotton and flour kings\" due to their empire of the ten Shenxin [[textile mill]]s and sixteen Maoxin and Fuxin flour mills. By the mid-1930s, the Rongs held almost 20% of spindles in Chinese owned textile mills.<ref name=\":4\">Parks M. Coble. \u201c[http://www.weber.edu/WSUImages/History/Parks%20Coble%202013%20WSU%20talk%20(1).pdf The Historical Roots of Shanghai\u2019s Modern Miracle.]\u201d Asian Studies Lecture Series. Weber State University. 2013.</ref> However, in August 1937, they lost five of their seven Shanghai mills. Two were bombed and taken over by military forces, while the other three fell under Japanese control. The last two surviving mills were in the International Settlement, which was relatively protected from Japanese attacks as a zone of neutrality. While mills were encouraged to move inland and many did, the ones that stayed in Shanghai like the last two Shenxin mills registered as foreign entities for protection. They \"leased\" their mills to foreign owners and hired fake foreign managers so that they could fly a foreign flag. In fact, since the two mills were actually over capacity before the conflict, they operated more efficiently during this period, and one actually expanded and increased output.<ref name=\":6\"/> Even though the industry had taken a big hit, any mills that were not destroyed enjoyed decent profits due to high demand and low supply. This incentivized industrialists who were still in the area to rebuild mills, and they were able to bring the area back up to 40% of prewar production.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen the Pacific War erupted, the International Settlement came under heavy fire, and British or American registration made factories a target. The Japanese took over the Rongs' remaining two mills on the grounds that they were enemy property. However, since the Chinese were no longer Japan's biggest enemy, the military was ready to restore Chinese mills in Shanghai to industrialists willing to work with the occupation. The Japanese opposed returning the mills that they had restored and maintained, especially without a payment in return for all of the rebuilding they had to do. However, the Chinese manufacturers argued that they could more easily operate in the Chinese market and gain access to cotton produced in rural areas. One industrialist also appealed to a Japanese government connection of his who was a strong advocate for Pan-Asianism, and returning the mills to establish good relations was seen as a symbol of the Pan-Asian movement. In return, the industrialists were required to show public support for the Japanese, and many plant managers joined the control organizations of the puppet government.\n\nHowever, Japan still controlled a significant amount of the raw cotton in China, so most of the cotton was either shipped to Japan or given to Japanese mills in China. Due to this lack of cotton, several of the Shenxin mills stopped production while others operated at a fraction of their capacity. The Rongs had to turn to the black market to continue profitable operation. They rented out their equipment to smaller rural workshops that could more easily evade control and tax.<ref name=\":6\"/> Ultimately, this willingness to work with and around the political powers of the time allowed the Rongs to survive, as well as the other prominent mill families of the time.\n\n=== Recovering from War ===\nChina's [[textile industry]] only became dominated by the Chinese after the defeat of Japan in 1945, which gave China ownership of many well-equipped and efficient manufacturing units. However, Chinese management was limited in technical and managerial skill. Furthermore, because of the deterioration with lack of maintenance of many plants during the war, efficiency in 1947 varied between 65-80% of prewar standards. Combined with the loss of spindles due to the destruction of the war, output was only 40% of 1937 output.<ref name=\":3\" /> After Japan's retreat, the Chinese government took over 40 mills and incorporated them into the Chinese Textile Industries Corporation (CTIC), arguing that government management would get the mills running again most quickly. The government wanted the mills to clothe the army and to produce enough profit to reduce the government budget deficit. It also wanted to organize the mills to take over markets formerly supplied by Japan and to alleviate the clothing shortage in China and thus take over the domestic textile market. Ultimately this resulted in the government controlling 50% of China's textile industry. However, one of the actual reasons these mills were more efficient was because the Japanese had maintained the equipment in their mills well during the war. Yet even with easier access to capital, the government made no moves to expand its mills, indicating a lack of desire to invest but rather a desire to reap profits.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nPrivate mills continued to try to grow, but major obstacles included high production costs due to inflation and scarcity of foreign exchange with which to buy raw cotton, machinery, and supplies. The war had wreaked havoc on the land, and the textile machine tool industry which had been prospering was largely lost. Finally, as the Chinese Communist Party rose to power, many mill owners packed their bags and moved their operations to Hong Kong to survive, allowing the next stage of development to take place in Hong Kong.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Economy of China}}\n\n[[Category:Textile industry of China]]\n", "name_user": "Quebec99", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix duplicate ref names \u2013You can help!", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_industry_in_China"}

Silver, fractured mirrors, and tin foil were the basic decorating materials loved by early amphetamine users of the sixties. Name covered the whole factory in silver, even the elevator. Warhol's years at the Factory were known as the Silver Era. Aside from the prints and paintings, Warhol produced shoes, films, sculptures and commissioned work in various genres to brand and sell items with his name. His first commissions consisted of a single silkscreen portrait for $25,000, with additional canvases in other colors for $5,000 each. He later increased the price of alternative colors to $20,000 each. Warhol used a large portion of his income to finance the Factory.<ref name=\"Factory Made 2003\"/>\n\nThe Factory was the hip hangout for artistic types, [[amphetamine]] (speed) users, and the [[Warhol superstars]]. It was famed for its groundbreaking parties. In the studio, Warhol's workers would make [[silkscreen]]s and [[lithograph]]s under his direction. In 1968, Warhol moved the Factory to the sixth floor of the [[Decker Building]], 33 Union Square West, near [[Max's Kansas City]], a club which Warhol and his entourage frequently visited.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/ |website=Max's Kansas City |date=March 25, 2010 |title=Warhol Automobile Paintings To Finally See Daylight}}</ref> By the time Warhol had achieved a reputation, he was working day and night on his paintings. Warhol used silkscreens so that he could mass-produce images the way corporations mass-produced consumer goods. To increase production, he attracted a m\u00e9nage of [[adult film]] performers, [[drag queens]], socialites, drug addicts, musicians, and free-thinkers who became known as the Warhol Superstars, to help him. These \"art-workers\" helped him create his paintings, starred in his films, and created the atmosphere for which the Factory became legendary.\n\nSpeaking in 2002, musician [[John Cale]] said, \"It wasn't called the Factory for nothing. It was where the [[assembly line]] for the silkscreens happened. While one person was making a silkscreen, somebody else would be filming a [[Screen Tests (films)|screen test]].

Silver, fractured mirrors, and tin foil were the basic decorating materials loved by early amphetamine users of the sixties. Name covered the whole factory in silver, even the elevator. Warhol's years at the Factory were known as the Silver Era. Aside from the prints and paintings, Warhol produced shoes, films, sculptures and commissioned work in various genres to brand and sell items with his name. His first commissions consisted of a single silkscreen portrait for $25,000, with additional canvases in other colors for $5,000 each. He later increased the price of alternative colors to $20,000 each. Warhol used a large portion of his income to finance the Factory.<ref name=\"Factory Made 2003\"/>\n\nThe Factory was the hip hangout for artistic types, [[amphetamine]] (speed) users, and the [[Warhol superstars]]. It was famed for its groundbreaking parties. In the studio, Warhol's workers would make [[silkscreen]]s and [[lithograph]]s under his direction. In 1968, Warhol moved the Factory to the sixth floor of the [[Decker Building]], 33 Union Square West, near [[Max's Kansas City]], a club which Warhol and his entourage frequently visited.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/ |website=Max's Kansas City |date=March 25, 2010 |title=Warhol Automobile Paintings To Finally See Daylight}}</ref> By the time Warhol had achieved a reputation, he was working day and night on his paintings. Warhol used silkscreens so that he could mass-produce images the way corporations mass-produced consumer goods. To increase production, he attracted a m\u00e9nage of [[adult film]] performers, [[drag queens]], socialites, drug addicts, musicians, and free-thinkers who became known as the Warhol Superstars, to help him. These \"art-workers\" helped him create his paintings, starred in his films, and created the atmosphere for which the Factory became legendary.\n\nSpeaking in 2002, musician [[John Cale]] said, \"It wasn't called the Factory for nothing. It was where the [[assembly line]] for the silkscreens happened. While one person was making a silkscreen, somebody else would be filming a [[Screen Tests (films)|screen test]]. Every day something new.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/warhol/story/0,11478,648898,00.html |title=My 15 minutes | work=[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBilly Name brought in the red couch which became a prominent furnishing at the Factory, finding it on the sidewalk of 47th street during one of his \"midnight outings.\" The sofa quickly became a favorite place for Factory guests to crash overnight, usually after coming down from [[amphetamine|speed]]. It was featured in many photographs and films from the Silver era, including ''[[Couch (film)|Couch]]'' and ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]''.

The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in the rear of the headquarters of the [[Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques]] (USFSA) at the Rue Saint Honor\u00e9 229 in Paris on 21 May 1904.<ref>Classic Football History of FIFA \u2013 Foundation, https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/foundation.html</ref> The French name and acronym are used even outside French-speaking countries. The founding members were the national associations of [[Royal Belgian Football Association|Belgium]], [[Danish Football Association|Denmark]], [[French Football Federation|France]], [[Royal Dutch Football Association|the Netherlands]], Spain (represented by the then-[[Real Madrid C.F.|Madrid Football Club]]; [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|the Royal Spanish Football Federation]] was not created until 1913), [[Swedish Football Association|Sweden]] and [[Swiss Football Association|Switzerland]]. Also, that same day, the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) declared its intention of affiliating through a telegram.<ref name=\"Filmcircle.com\" />\n\nThe first president of FIFA was [[Robert Gu\u00e9rin]]. Gu\u00e9rin was replaced in 1906 by [[Daniel Burley Woolfall]] from [[The Football Association|England]], by then a member of the association. The first tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition for the [[Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympics in London]] was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA.{{dubious|date=June 2015}}\n\nMembership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of [[South African Football Association|South Africa]] in 1909, [[Argentine Football Association|Argentina]] in 1912, [[Canadian Soccer Association|Canada]] and [[Federaci\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol de Chile|Chile]] in 1913, and the [[United States Soccer Federation|United States]] in 1914.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/organisation/52/00/10/fs-120_01a_ma.pdf |title=FIFA's 208 Member Associations |accessdate=1 December 2015 |author=FIFA |date=10 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited, the organization's survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organization was run by Dutchman [[Carl Anton Wilhelm Hirschmann|Carl Hirschmann]]. It was saved from extinction but at the cost of the withdrawal of the [[Home Nations]] (of the United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their recent World War enemies.

FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: [[The Football Association|England]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]], and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Ireland]], who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognized for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed by at least six of the eight delegates.\n\nThe FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies that have the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the congress, the executive committee, the general secretariat, and standing and ad-hoc committees.<ref>{{cite web |last=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |title=FIFA TRANSFER REGULATIONS AND UEFA PLAYER ELIGIBILITY RULES: MAJOR CHANGES IN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON MINORS |url=http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |publisher=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |accessdate=28 March 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319030412/http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Discipline of national associations ===\nFIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world.

The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals'' ([[Harper Collins]]) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner [[International Sport and Leisure]] (ISL), and revealed how some football officials have been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for [[Sepp Blatter]]'s continued control of FIFA as the organization's president. Shortly after the release of ''Foul!'' a [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' expos\u00e9 by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke, screened on 11 June 2006, reported that Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than \u00a31m worth of [[bribery|bribes]] pocketed by football officials. [[David Triesman, Baron Triesman|Lord Triesman]], the former chairman of the English Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that \"behaves like a [[mafia]] family\", highlighting the organization's \"decades-long traditions of bribes, bungs and [[corruption]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-27801996 |title=BBC News Fifa 'like a mafia family' says former FA boss Triesman |date=11 June 2014 |accessdate=3 October 2014 |website=BBC News }}</ref>\n\nAll testimonies offered in the ''Panorama'' expos\u00e9 were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save one: Mel Brennan, a former CONCACAF official, became the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations of corruption, nonfeasance and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA leadership.

Jennings claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100&nbsp;million. A former ISL executive said that there were suspicions within the company that they were only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The programme also alleged that another current official, [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels.' ''Panorama'' also alleged that FIFA requires nations bidding to host the World Cup to agree to implement special laws, including a blanket [[tax exemption]] for FIFA and its corporate sponsors, and limitation of [[workers rights]]. Contrary to FIFA's demands, these conditions were revealed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government, resulting in them being told by FIFA that their bid could be adversely affected. Following Jennings' earlier investigations, he was banned from all FIFA press conferences, for reasons he claimed had not been made clear. The accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations, either verbally or by letter.\n\n[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] and [[Andy Anson]], head of England's World Cup bid, criticized the timing of the broadcast, three days before FIFA's decision on the host for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], on the grounds that it might damage England's bid; the voters included officials accused by the programme.<ref>''Panorama'', [[BBC One]], 29 November 2010</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11841783 \"Panorama: Three Fifa World Cup officials took bribe\"], [[BBC News]], 29 November 2010</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, it came to light that the [[International Olympic Committee]] had started inquiry proceedings against FIFA honorary president [[Jo\u00e3o Havelange]] into claims of bribery. ''Panorama'' alleged that Havelange accepted a $1 million 'bung' in 1997 from ISL. The IOC stated that it \"takes all allegations of corruption very seriously and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any IOC members to be passed to our ethics commission\".<ref>{{cite news |author=International |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/8581704/Fifa-honourary-president-Joao-Havelange-faces-IOC-inquiry.html |title=Fifa {{Sic |nolink=y|honou|rary |expected=honorary}} president Joao Havelange faces IOC inquiry |work=Daily Telegraph |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2014 interview, American sports writer [[Dave Zirin]] said that corruption is endemic to FIFA leadership, and that the organization should be abolished for the good of the game. He said that currently, FIFA is in charge of both monitoring corruption in football matches, and marketing and selling the sport, but that two \"separate\" organizational bodies are needed: an organizational body that monitors corruption and match-fixing and the like, and an organization that's responsible for marketing and sponsorships and selling the sport. Zirin said the idea of having a single organization that's responsible for both seems highly ineffective and detrimental to the sport.<ref>[http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=12014 Dave Zirin: Abolish FIFA] (17 June 2014), [[Dave Zirin]], ''[[The Real News Network]]''</ref>\n\nIn May 2015, 14 people were arrested, including nine FIFA officials, after being accused of corruption.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/several-top-fifa-officials-arrested |title=Fifa officials arrested on corruption charges as World Cup inquiry launched |author=The Guardian |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Guilty pleas===\nBetween 2013 and 2015 four individuals, and two sports television rights corporations pleaded guilty to United States financial misconduct charges.

The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in the rear of the headquarters of the [[Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques]] (USFSA) at the Rue Saint Honor\u00e9 229 in Paris on 21 May 1904.<ref>Classic Football History of FIFA \u2013 Foundation, https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/foundation.html</ref> The French name and acronym are used even outside French-speaking countries. The founding members were the national associations of [[Royal Belgian Football Association|Belgium]], [[Danish Football Association|Denmark]], [[French Football Federation|France]], [[Royal Dutch Football Association|the Netherlands]], Spain (represented by the then-[[Real Madrid C.F.|Madrid Football Club]]; [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|the Royal Spanish Football Federation]] was not created until 1913), [[Swedish Football Association|Sweden]] and [[Swiss Football Association|Switzerland]]. Also, that same day, the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) declared its intention of affiliating through a telegram.<ref name=\"Filmcircle.com\" />\n\nThe first president of FIFA was [[Robert Gu\u00e9rin]]. Gu\u00e9rin was replaced in 1906 by [[Daniel Burley Woolfall]] from [[The Football Association|England]], by then a member of the association. The first tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition for the [[Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympics in London]] was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA.{{dubious|date=June 2015}}\n\nMembership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of [[South African Football Association|South Africa]] in 1909, [[Argentine Football Association|Argentina]] in 1912, [[Canadian Soccer Association|Canada]] and [[Federaci\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol de Chile|Chile]] in 1913, and the [[United States Soccer Federation|United States]] in 1914.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/organisation/52/00/10/fs-120_01a_ma.pdf |title=FIFA's 208 Member Associations |accessdate=1 December 2015 |author=FIFA |date=10 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited, the organization's survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organization was run by Dutchman [[Carl Anton Wilhelm Hirschmann|Carl Hirschmann]]. It was saved from extinction but at the cost of the withdrawal of the [[Home Nations]] (of the United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their recent World War enemies.

FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: [[The Football Association|England]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]], and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Ireland]], who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognized for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed by at least six of the eight delegates.\n\nThe FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies that have the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the congress, the executive committee, the general secretariat, and standing and ad-hoc committees.<ref>{{cite web |last=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |title=FIFA TRANSFER REGULATIONS AND UEFA PLAYER ELIGIBILITY RULES: MAJOR CHANGES IN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON MINORS |url=http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |publisher=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |accessdate=28 March 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319030412/http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Discipline of national associations ===\nFIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of FIFA's associate member organizations or if the associate is not functioning properly.\n\nA 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs, and appear in official matches for a maximum of two, in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of [[FIFA Two|two former Ireland internationals]].

The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals'' ([[Harper Collins]]) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner [[International Sport and Leisure]] (ISL), and revealed how some football officials have been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for [[Sepp Blatter]]'s continued control of FIFA as the organization's president. Shortly after the release of ''Foul!'' a [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' expos\u00e9 by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke, screened on 11 June 2006, reported that Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than \u00a31m worth of [[bribery|bribes]] pocketed by football officials. [[David Triesman, Baron Triesman|Lord Triesman]], the former chairman of the English Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that \"behaves like a [[mafia]] family\", highlighting the organization's \"decades-long traditions of bribes, bungs and [[corruption]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-27801996 |title=BBC News Fifa 'like a mafia family' says former FA boss Triesman |date=11 June 2014 |accessdate=3 October 2014 |website=BBC News }}</ref>\n\nAll testimonies offered in the ''Panorama'' expos\u00e9 were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save one: Mel Brennan, a former CONCACAF official, became the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations of corruption, nonfeasance and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA leadership. Brennan\u2014the highest-level [[African-American]] in the history of world football governance\u2014joined Jennings, [[Trinidad]]ian journalist Lisana Liburd and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate allocations of money by CONCACAF, and drew connections between ostensible CONCACAF criminality and similar behaviours at FIFA.

Jennings claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100&nbsp;million. A former ISL executive said that there were suspicions within the company that they were only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The programme also alleged that another current official, [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels.' ''Panorama'' also alleged that FIFA requires nations bidding to host the World Cup to agree to implement special laws, including a blanket [[tax exemption]] for FIFA and its corporate sponsors, and limitation of [[workers rights]]. Contrary to FIFA's demands, these conditions were revealed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government, resulting in them being told by FIFA that their bid could be adversely affected. Following Jennings' earlier investigations, he was banned from all FIFA press conferences, for reasons he claimed had not been made clear. The accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations, either verbally or by letter.\n\n[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] and [[Andy Anson]], head of England's World Cup bid, criticized the timing of the broadcast, three days before FIFA's decision on the host for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], on the grounds that it might damage England's bid; the voters included officials accused by the programme.<ref>''Panorama'', [[BBC One]], 29 November 2010</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11841783 \"Panorama: Three Fifa World Cup officials took bribe\"], [[BBC News]], 29 November 2010</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, it came to light that the [[International Olympic Committee]] had started inquiry proceedings against FIFA honorary president [[Jo\u00e3o Havelange]] into claims of bribery. ''Panorama'' alleged that Havelange accepted a $1 million 'bung' in 1997 from ISL. The IOC stated that it \"takes all allegations of corruption very seriously and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any IOC members to be passed to our ethics commission\".<ref>{{cite news |author=International |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/8581704/Fifa-honourary-president-Joao-Havelange-faces-IOC-inquiry.html |title=Fifa {{Sic |nolink=y|honou|rary |expected=honorary}} president Joao Havelange faces IOC inquiry |work=Daily Telegraph |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2014 interview, American sports writer [[Dave Zirin]] said that corruption is endemic to FIFA leadership, and that the organization should be abolished for the good of the game. He said that currently, FIFA is in charge of both monitoring corruption in football matches, and marketing and selling the sport, but that two \"separate\" organizational bodies are needed: an organizational body that monitors corruption and match-fixing and the like, and an organization that's responsible for marketing and sponsorships and selling the sport. Zirin said the idea of having a single organization that's responsible for both seems highly ineffective and detrimental to the sport.<ref>[http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=12014 Dave Zirin: Abolish FIFA] (17 June 2014), [[Dave Zirin]], ''[[The Real News Network]]''</ref>\n\nIn May 2015, 14 people were arrested, including nine FIFA officials, after being accused of corruption.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/several-top-fifa-officials-arrested |title=Fifa officials arrested on corruption charges as World Cup inquiry launched |author=The Guardian |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Guilty pleas===\nBetween 2013 and 2015 four individuals, and two sports television rights corporations pleaded guilty to United States financial misconduct charges.

For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street.

Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the [[Birmingham West Suburban Railway]] and hold two tracks.\n\n===Customer service and ticketing===\nNetwork Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, and provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by [[Avanti West Coast]], with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] also provides a public transport information point for the station.\n\nThe station is a [[penalty fare]] station for [[West Midlands Railway]] and [[London Northwestern Railway]] (West Midlands Trains' [[brand|brands]]). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street.

The collision caused the guards van of the Derby train to [[telescoping (railway)|telescope]] with the rear coach. Three people were killed, and twenty four injured.

Outside Birmingham, in [[Solihull]], is {{rws|Birmingham International}}, which serves [[Birmingham Airport]] and the [[National Exhibition Centre]].\n===Railway operations===\nNew Street is the hub of the West Midlands rail network, as well as being a major national hub. The station is one of seventeen operated and managed by Network Rail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |title=Commercial information |date=May 2013 |work=Complete National Rail Timetable |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page=43 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904231906/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |archive-date=4 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Network Rail also provides operational staff for the station.\n\nStation staff are provided on all platforms to assist with the safe 'dispatch' of trains. For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street. The station is allocated the [[IATA location identifier]] [http://www.theairdb.com/airport/QQN.html QQN].\n\n====Approach tunnels====\nAll trains arriving and departing must use one of the several tunnels around the station.<ref name=\"Nstr18541967\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Railway Track Diagrams 4: Midlands & North West |editor-last=Bridge |editor-first=Mike |isbn=978-0-9549866-7-4 |oclc=880581044 |last1=Yonge |first1=John |last2=Padgett |first2=David |last3=Szwenk |first3=John |edition=3rd |date=August 2013 |origyear=1990 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |at=map 16 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n*Stour Valley Line Tunnel \u2013 heads westwards towards Soho Junction & Wolverhampton, and passes under the [[National Indoor Arena]]. This tunnel is {{convert|927|yard|m}} long in total, comprising the original New Street North Tunnel, {{convert|751|yard|m}} and extension: 'Arena' Tunnel, {{convert|176|yard|m}}. The former was opened in 1852 as part of the [[Stour Valley Line]], and holds two tracks.\n*New Street South Tunnel \u2013 {{convert|254|yard|m}} long, heading eastbound, passing under the [[Bull Ring Shopping Centre|Bullring]], and {{rws|Birmingham Moor Street}} station, heading towards [[Duddeston railway station|Duddeston]], [[Adderley Park railway station|Adderley Park]], the [[Camp Hill Line]] and the [[Cross Country Route|Derby lines]] towards [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]]. This tunnel opened in 1854, originally holding two tracks; it was widened in 1896 to hold four tracks, with two double-track parallel bores.\n*Gloucester Line Tunnels \u2013 are four separate tunnels heading south-west towards [[Five Ways railway station|Five Ways]]. Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the [[Birmingham West Suburban Railway]] and hold two tracks.\n\n===Customer service and ticketing===\nNetwork Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, and provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by [[Avanti West Coast]], with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] also provides a public transport information point for the station.\n\nThe station is a [[penalty fare]] station for [[West Midlands Railway]] and [[London Northwestern Railway]] (West Midlands Trains' [[brand|brands]]). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street. [[Chiltern Railways]] have occasionally used New Street during engineering works.\n\nWest Midlands Trains operates a traincrew depot at the station and stables some trains overnight around the station. For the most part, they use [[Soho TMD]] for electric traction units, with its non-electric units kept at [[Tyseley TMD]] to the southeast of Birmingham.\n\nCrossCountry also operates a traincrew depot at the station; it uses Tyseley TMD for the [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] units, and its Voyagers are based at [[Central Rivers TMD]].\n\n==Train services==\n[[File:Birmingham & West Mids Passenger Railway Map.JPG|thumb|Map of passenger railways in the Birmingham & West Midlands area]]\nThe basic Monday to Saturday off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:\n\n[[Avanti West Coast]]\n* 3tph to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] (1 via Rugby, 1 via Watford Junction and 1 via Milton Keynes Central).

The collision caused the guards van of the Derby train to [[telescoping (railway)|telescope]] with the rear coach. Three people were killed, and twenty four injured. The later inquest ruled that the express had overrun the danger signal due to driver error, and the misty conditions had made the rails moist, leading to wheelslip when the train tried to brake.<ref>{{cite web|title=1921 accident report|url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/MoT_BirminghamNewStreet1921.pdf|publisher=Railways Archive|accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gateway Plus]]\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station]]\n* [[Birmingham Moor Street railway station]]\n* [[Transport in Birmingham]]\n* [[Transport for West Midlands]]\n* [[Commuter rail in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Grand Central, Birmingham]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Foster, Richard, ''Birmingham New Street.
