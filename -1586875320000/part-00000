During this era, Circuit City became known for its exceptional service, going so far as to have many of its staff factory-trained. Its slogan, likewise, was \"Welcome to Circuit City, Where Service Is State of the Art\".<ref>{{cite web|author1=Trexler Channel|title=Circuit City Dancing Dog commercial|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH7cr2DLHMM|website=YouTube|accessdate=26 July 2016|date=28 July 2008}}</ref> Later, Circuit City returned to New York City opening a {{convert|40000|sqft|m2|abbr=on|adj=on}} superstore in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], the first of two planned Manhattan locations.<ref name=\"prnewswire\">{{cite news|author1=Circuit City Stores, Inc.|title=Circuit City to Grand Open First Manhattan Superstore|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/circuit-city-to-grand-open-first-manhattan-superstore-77061467.html|accessdate=29 July 2016|work=PR Newswire Association, LLC|date=20 October 1998}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\n[[Image:Circuitcity.jpg|thumb|200px|Initial Horizon format in [[Rome, Georgia]], used in 2000]]\nBy 2000, many Circuit City stores were out of date and in bad locations, unable to compete with newer [[Best Buy]] stores. In 2000, Circuit City abandoned the large appliance business and introduced a more self-serve \"[[Big box retailer|Big Box]]\" format called \"Horizon\". This was controversial because in the previous year Circuit City was the second largest appliance retailer in the United States, behind only [[Sears]]. The company had earned nearly US$1.6 billion in sales revenue from large appliances in 1999. However, executives were concerned about the competition from [[Home Depot]] and [[Lowe's]] and believed there would be big savings in warehouse storage and delivery costs if they quit the large appliance business. It was later realized that Circuit City thus missed out on the [[United States housing bubble|residential housing boom of the mid-2000s]], which saw a dramatic rise in new-appliance sales.\n\n[[Image:Circuit City Denton TX.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Final Horizon format in [[Denton, Texas]], used from 2004 to 2007]]\n\nEvery Superstore was retrofitted after the exit from the large-appliance business, using the space for an expanded self-serve computer accessory and software selection. Stores at the time sold only PlayStation games under an exclusive agreement with [[Sony]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Cyrogenic|title=Circuit City|url=http://www.retrojunk.com/article/show/4946/circuit-city|website=Retro Junk|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref> The new space allowed them to sell Nintendo, Sega, and eventually Xbox games after the agreement ended. Music and movie sales had been added to most stores years before, but the extra space allowed the selection to be added to smaller stores. The retrofitting project alone cost the company US$1.5 billion.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chandler|first1=Susan|title=Circuit City Abandons Appliances For Electronics|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-07-26/business/0007260497_1_circuit-city-stores-appliance-sears|accessdate=29 July 2016|work=Chicago Tribune|date=26 July 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Ramstad|first1=Evan|title=Circuit City Unveils Plans to ExitAppliance Business, Take Charges|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB964528131640051432|accessdate=29 July 2016|work=Wall Street Journal|date=26 July 2000}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Circuit City converted to a single hourly pay structure in all stores, eliminating commissioned sales. Many previously commissioned sales associates were offered new positions as hourly \"product specialists\", while 3,900 salespeople were laid off, saving the company about $130 million per year.

The goal of CarMax was to revolutionize used car retailing through a combination of large selection (400+ used cars at each store); low, no-haggle pricing; guaranteed quality; and a consumer-friendly shopping experience. The first location opened in Richmond, Virginia in September 1993. [[CarMax]] grew slowly for its first four years as the team refined the basic concept, then went public through an IPO as a \"[[tracking stock]]\" ([[KMX]]) of Circuit City in February 1997. The offering was managed by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, and raised more than $400mm for a 20% interest in the company, with Circuit City retaining the remaining 80% ownership. [[CarMax]] used the proceeds to repay Circuit City's initial $170mm investment in the company, then used the remainder to grow rapidly, adding 27 more stores from 1997 to 2000, and turning its first profit in FY2001.<ref name=SEC>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/03/9999999997-03-021911|title=CarMax|access-date=August 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429002644/http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/03/9999999997-03-021911|archive-date=April 29, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Circuit City sold a further 10% of its interest in CarMax in July 2001 for $140mm, with proceeds going to Circuit City.

The stock distribution provided Circuit City shareholders with KMX stock valued at over $1.2bn at the time of the spin off in 2002.<ref name=SEC/>\n\n===Circuit City Express===\n'''Circuit City Express''' was a chain of mall-based Circuit City stores with over 55 locations at its peak.

In 2000, Circuit City abandoned the large appliance business and introduced a more self-serve \"[[Big box retailer|Big Box]]\" format called \"Horizon\". This was controversial because in the previous year Circuit City was the second largest appliance retailer in the United States, behind only [[Sears]]. The company had earned nearly US$1.6 billion in sales revenue from large appliances in 1999. However, executives were concerned about the competition from [[Home Depot]] and [[Lowe's]] and believed there would be big savings in warehouse storage and delivery costs if they quit the large appliance business. It was later realized that Circuit City thus missed out on the [[United States housing bubble|residential housing boom of the mid-2000s]], which saw a dramatic rise in new-appliance sales.\n\n[[Image:Circuit City Denton TX.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Final Horizon format in [[Denton, Texas]], used from 2004 to 2007]]\n\nEvery Superstore was retrofitted after the exit from the large-appliance business, using the space for an expanded self-serve computer accessory and software selection.

The goal of CarMax was to revolutionize used car retailing through a combination of large selection (400+ used cars at each store); low, no-haggle pricing; guaranteed quality; and a consumer-friendly shopping experience. The first location opened in Richmond, Virginia in September 1993. [[CarMax]] grew slowly for its first four years as the team refined the basic concept, then went public through an IPO as a \"[[tracking stock]]\" ([[KMX]]) of Circuit City in February 1997. The offering was managed by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, and raised more than $400mm for a 20% interest in the company, with Circuit City retaining the remaining 80% ownership. [[CarMax]] used the proceeds to repay Circuit City's initial $170mm investment in the company, then used the remainder to grow rapidly, adding 27 more stores from 1997 to 2000, and turning its first profit in FY2001.<ref name=SEC>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/03/9999999997-03-021911|title=CarMax|access-date=August 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429002644/http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/03/9999999997-03-021911|archive-date=April 29, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Circuit City sold a further 10% of its interest in CarMax in July 2001 for $140mm, with proceeds going to Circuit City.

The court, however, upheld the plaintiffs' claim that the monies paid for the protection plan be reimbursed and credit be issued for non-working goods returned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pacer.mad.uscourts.gov/dc/opinions/gorton/pdf/schacter.pdf|title=Schacter, and as representative for all persons similarly situated vs. Circuit City, Inc 05-12456-MNG|accessdate=October 28, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327052345/http://pacer.mad.uscourts.gov/dc/opinions/gorton/pdf/schacter.pdf|archivedate=March 27, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nLiquidators handling the sale of remaining Circuit City inventory have also become the target of consumer complaints, not only for often-uncompetitive pricing of items but also for an \"all sales final\" policy which allows the sale of defective or damaged merchandise at former Circuit City locations with no recourse afforded to the consumer.<ref>[http://www.thebostonchannel.com/asseenon5/18773855/detail.html Customers Burned In Circuit City Closeout Sale: No Recourse Offered For Damaged Items] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226200344/http://www.thebostonchannel.com/asseenon5/18773855/detail.html |date=February 26, 2009 }}, WCVB 5 Boston, February 23, 2009</ref>\n\n==Real estate holdings==\nDue to the expansion of Circuit City stores in the 1970s-1990s, the company accumulated a surplus of unused real estate with a presence in nearly every major market in the country.

Directed by [[Lambert Hillyer]] from a screenplay by [[Garrett Fort]], the film stars [[Otto Kruger]], [[Gloria Holden]] in the title role, [[Marguerite Churchill]] and features, as the only cast member to return from the original, [[Edward Van Sloan]] &ndash; although his character's name was altered from Van Helsing to ''Von'' Helsing.\n\n''Dracula's Daughter'' tells the story of Countess Marya Zaleska, the daughter of [[Count Dracula]] and herself a vampire. Following Dracula's death, she believes that by destroying his body she will be free of his influence and live normally. When this fails, she turns to a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth ([[Otto Kruger]]). He, in turn, has a fiance, Janet ([[Marguerite Churchill]]). The Countess kidnaps Janet and takes her to Transylvania, leading to a battle between Dr. Garth and the Countess in an attempt by him to save Janet.\n\nOstensibly based on a [[short story]] titled \"[[Dracula's Guest]]\" by [[Bram Stoker]], the film bears little or no resemblance to the original source material. [[David O. Selznick]] initially purchased the rights to the story for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Selznick, likely knowing he could not legally make the film because of Universal's copyright on the original film, sold the rights to Universal. After first assigning the picture to [[James Whale]], Universal production head [[Carl Laemmle, Jr.]] finally put Hillyer in the director's chair.\n\nWhile not as successful as the original upon its release, the film was generally well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been deeply divided. Contemporary critics and scholars have noted the film's strong lesbian overtones, which Universal acknowledged from the start of production and exploited in some early advertising.\n\n==Plot==\n''Dracula's Daughter'' begins a few moments after ''Dracula'' ends. [[Count Dracula]] has just been destroyed by [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Von Helsing]] <!--in this film the character's name is spelled VON Helsing so please do not change it -->([[Edward Van Sloan]]). Von Helsing is arrested by two Whitby policemen, Sergeant Wilkes ([[E. E. Clive]]) and constable Albert ([[Billy Bevan]]).  Von Helsing is sent by the Whitby police to [[Scotland Yard]], where he explains to Sir Basil Humphrey ([[Gilbert Emery]]) that he indeed did destroy Count Dracula, but because he had already been dead for over 500 years, it cannot be considered murder. Instead of hiring a lawyer, he enlists the aid of a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth ([[Otto Kruger]]), who was once one of his star students.\n\nSergeant Wilkes leaves the Whitby gaol to meet an officer from Scotland Yard at the train station. Meanwhile, Dracula's daughter, Countess Marya Zaleska ([[Gloria Holden]]), enters the gaol and mesmerizes Albert with her jeweled ring and with the aid of her manservant, Sandor ([[Irving Pichel]]), steals Dracula's body from the Whitby gaol and after tossing salt on the pyre ritualistically burns Dracula's body, hoping to break her curse of vampirism. However, Sandor soon begins to discourage her telling her that all that is in her eyes is \"death.\" She soon gives in to her thirst for blood. The Countess resumes her hunting, mesmerizing her victims with her exotic jeweled ring. After a chance meeting with Dr. Garth at a society party, the Countess asks him to help her overcome the influence she feels from beyond the grave. The doctor advises her to defeat her cravings by confronting them and the Countess becomes hopeful that her will, plus Dr. Garth's science, will be strong enough to overcome Dracula's malevolence.\n\nThe Countess sends Sandor to fetch her a model to paint.  He sees a pretty young woman, Lili ([[Nan Grey]]), and follows her onto a bridge.  The woman pauses at the railing looking despondent. Sandor promises her food, warmth and money.  She hesitates, but Sandor explains that he seeks her for his mistress. Lili returns with Sandor. Countess Zaleska initially resists her urges but succumbs and attacks her. Lili survives the attack and is examined by Dr. Garth through hypnosis; she reveals enough information to let Dr. Garth know that it was Countess Zaleska that attacked her, but suffers heart failure and dies. The Countess gives up fighting her urges and accepts that a cure is not possible; she lures Dr. Garth to [[Transylvania]] by kidnapping Janet Blake ([[Marguerite Churchill]]), his secretary, whom he has a playfully antagonistic relationship with, but now realizes that he cares for her. Zaleska intends to transform Dr. Garth into a vampire to be her eternal companion. Arriving at Castle Dracula in Transylvania, Dr. Garth agrees to exchange his life for Janet's. Before he can be transformed, Countess Zaleska is destroyed when Sandor shoots her through the heart with an arrow as revenge for her breaking her promise to make him immortal. He takes aim at Dr. Garth but is shot dead by a Scotland Yard policeman who, along with Von Helsing, have followed Dr. Garth from London.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gloria Holden]] as Countess Marya Zaleska - Dracula's Daughter\n* [[Otto Kruger]] as Dr. Jeffrey Garth\n* [[Marguerite Churchill]] as Janet Blake\n* [[Irving Pichel]] as Sandor\n* [[Gilbert Emery]] as Sir Basil Humphrey, Scotland Yard\n* [[Edward Van Sloan]]\t as [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Von Helsing]] <!--in this film the character's name is spelled VON Helsing so please do not change it -->\n* [[Halliwell Hobbes]] as Hawkins\n* [[Billy Bevan]] as Albert\n* [[Nan Grey]] as Lili\n* [[Hedda Hopper]] as Lady Esme Hammond\n* [[Claud Allister]] as Sir Aubrey\n* [[Edgar Norton]] as Hobbs\n* [[E.

[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] executive [[David O. Selznick]] negotiated a contract in 1933 with Stoker's widow, [[Florence Stoker|Florence]], to buy the rights to the chapter for an advance of $500 against a purchase price of $5,000. MGM's lawyers and executives were worried about the use of the word \"Dracula\" in the film's title, fearing that Universal would take legal action, although Selznick's contract with Stoker explicitly listed \"Dracula's Daughter\" as a possible alternative title. The project was code-named \"Tarantula\" in correspondence.<ref name=\"skal1968\" />\n\nSelznick hired [[John L. Balderston]], who had previously worked on the 1931 ''Dracula'' and ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', to write the screenplay. Balderston's screenplay involved tying up loose ends from the original film. In it, Von Helsing returns to Transylvania to destroy the [[Brides of Dracula|three vampire brides]] seen in ''Dracula'' but overlooks a fourth tomb concealing Dracula's daughter. She follows him back to London and operates under the name \"Countess Szekelsky\". She attacks a young aristocrat and Von Helsing and the aristocrat's fianc\u00e9e track her back to Transylvania and destroy her. The script included scenes that implied that Dracula's daughter enjoyed torturing her male victims and that while under her control the men liked it too. Also included were shots of the Countess's chambers being stocked with whips and straps, which she would never use on-screen but whose uses the audience could imagine. Regardless of any objections that the [[Production Code Administration]] (PCA) would have raised to many aspects of the scenario, Balderston's script could never have been filmed because Selznick's contract with Stoker expressly barred him from using any Bram Stoker characters that did not appear in \"[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories|Dracula's Guest]]\". Selznick re-sold the rights to \"Dracula's Guest\" to Universal in September 1935<ref name=\"skal1968\">Skal, pp. 196\u201398</ref> for $12,500, which included the rights to Balderston's scenario.<ref name=\"curtis260\">Curtis, p. 260</ref> Horror film scholar [[David J. Skal]] theorizes that this was Selznick's actual motivation in buying the rights in the first place, to profit from Universal's desire for a sequel by tying up the only obvious source material.<ref>Skal, p. 196</ref>\n\n===Director===\nUniversal studio head Carl Laemmle, Jr. (nicknamed \"Junior\") wanted [[James Whale]], fresh from his great success with ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', to direct ''Dracula's Daughter''. Whale was idle, waiting for [[Irene Dunne]] to finish work on ''[[Magnificent Obsession (1935 film)|Magnificent Obsession]]'' so she could begin work on Whale's ''[[Show Boat (1936 film)|Show Boat]]''. Wary of directing two horror films in a row, Whale instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a mystery novel called ''The Hangover Murders''. Laemmle agreed only after extracting a promise from Whale that he would direct ''Dracula's Daughter'' next.<ref>Curtis, pp. 254\u201355</ref> Whale completed work on the film, titled ''[[Remember Last Night?]]'' for release, on September 14, 1935.<ref>Curtis, p. 258</ref> ''Magnificent Obsession'' completed filming on October 29. With Dunne freed up, Whale went to work on ''Show Boat''. Laemmle replaced him with [[A. Edward Sutherland]], who was best known for his work on comedies. Sutherland had as little interest in ''Dracula's Daughter'' as Whale and soon left the studio,<ref>Curtis, pp. 260\u201361</ref> and Hillyer came on to direct.\n\n===Universal script===\nThe earliest scenario for the Universal film was written by [[R. C. Sherriff]]. It began with three scenes set in the 14th Century and centered on the Dracula legend. It then switched to the present day, focusing on two engaged couples who visit Transylvania. The men explore the ruins of Dracula's castle. One is later found, insane, and the other goes missing. Professor Von Helsing is summoned and he tracks the missing man to London, where he is in thrall to Dracula's daughter, the Countess Szelinski (sic). When she attempts to flee with her thrall to the Orient by ship, Von Helsing and three others book passage on the same ship. During a violent storm, Von Helsing destroys Dracula's daughter and, with her hold over the men broken, the scenario closes with a double wedding. This version was submitted on August 28, 1935 to the [[British Board of Film Censors]], which rejected it, saying in part \"...{{nbsp}}''Dracula's Daughter'' would require half a dozen ... languages to adequately express its beastliness.\" On September 10 Sherriff met with BBFC representatives and submitted a revised scenario two days later. This scenario was passed but because its details were not recorded by the BBFC it is unknown how much it differed from the original or how much if any of that scenario was retained in the final script.<ref>Robertson pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nUniversal also submitted Sheriff's first draft to the PCA on September 5, 1935 and encountered stronger resistance from PCA enforcer [[Joseph Breen]] than it had from the British. Breen reported back that the script \"contains countless offensive stuff which makes the picture utterly impossible for approval under the Production Code\".<ref>Breen, quoted in Skal, p. 198</ref> A second draft was submitted on October 21, but it too was rejected, with many of Breen's objections centering on the 14th Century scenes in which Dracula himself appeared. It is unclear whether this submission was the same submission that the BBFC had previously passed. A third Sheriff draft was submitted three days later and Sherriff's fourth and final draft on November 10. All remained unacceptable, and Whale biographer James Curtis suggests that Whale, who had no interest in the project and feared that his commitment to it might cost him control over the filming of ''Show Boat'', encouraged Sherriff to submit ever more wildly unacceptable versions in hopes of getting himself off the film.<ref name=\"curtis260\" /> On January 14, 1936, producer [[E. M. Asher]] advised Breen that the Sherriff script was not going to be used and that a new script would be put together from scratch. Screenwriting duties were assigned to Garrett Fort.<ref>Skal, pp. 198\u201399</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:GloriaHolden2DraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg|thumb|right|Gloria Holden]]\n[[File:OttoKrugerDraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n''Dracula's Daughter'' was Gloria Holden's first starring role and reportedly she was extremely displeased at having been assigned it. Like many actors, Holden looked down on horror films. She had also seen [[Bela Lugosi]] struggle over the years since ''Dracula'' was made to free himself from [[Typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] and feared that the role would lead to the same fate for her. Critic Mark Clark believes that ironically it may have been Holden's disgust for the role that led to the quality of her performance. \"Her disdain for the part translates into a kind of self-loathing that perfectly suits her troubled character.\"<ref>Clark, p. 184</ref>\n\nInitially Lugosi and [[Jane Wyatt]] were set to star in the film. Universal also announced that [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Colin Clive]], who had starred together in ''Frankenstein'' and ''Bride of Frankenstein'', would appear,<ref name=\"rhodes219\">Rhodes, p. 219</ref> and that [[Cesar Romero]] would play Dr. Garth.<ref name=\"mank365\">Mank, p. 365</ref> According to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Universal had sought [[Herbert Marshall]] for the role of Sandor, before casting Pichel.<ref name=\"mank365\" /> None of them appeared except, after a fashion, Lugosi, in the form of a wax bust molded in his image for use in Dracula's coffin. Some sources report that Lugosi was paid as much as $4,000 for his abortive involvement, but the only confirmed record of any financial arrangement is a letter in which Lugosi consents to the use of his likeness at no cost to create the wax bust.<ref name=\"rhodes219\" />\n\n===Shooting===\n[[File:Dracula's Daughter - Poster 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Theatrical poster]]\nShooting on ''Dracula's Daughter'' began on February 4, 1936, rushed into production before Fort had completed the script,<ref>Mank, p. 356</ref> because of a deadline clause in Universal's option of the property from Selznick.<ref>Skal, p. 199</ref> The script was not finalized until shooting had been underway for three weeks.<ref name=\"mank357\" /> The film was completed on March 10.<ref>Mank, p. 358</ref> Despite studio orders that the film be shot on a seven-day-per-week schedule,<ref name=\"mank357\" /> filming ran seven days over its schedule and $50,000 over budget, with the final cost of the film tallied at $278,380.<ref>Senn, p. 361</ref>\n\n''Dracula's Daughter'' was the last in the first cycle of [[Universal Horror]] films that reached back into the 1920s. Publicly, Universal said it was because a British ban on horror films would cut too deeply into the revenue such films could generate.<ref>Johnson, p. 7</ref> In truth, the cycle was suspended because, just before filming on ''Dracula's Daughter'' had wrapped, the Laemmle family had lost control of Universal. Because of cost overruns on a number of pictures, Junior Laemmle was forced to borrow $1,000,000 on November 1, 1935. The money came from [[J. Cheever Cowdin]], head of the [[Standard Capital Corporation]], and from [[Charles R. Rogers]]. When the loan was called in March of the following year, Universal was unable to repay it. Standard assumed control of the studio on March 4 and Rogers replaced Junior as head of production. Rogers did not like horror films and he shut down production on them following the release of ''Dracula's Daughter'' to focus on fare like [[Deanna Durbin]] musicals.<ref>Johnson, p. 129</ref> Universal would not return to the horror genre for three years, when it released ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' in 1939.\n\n===Other production aspects===\nMakeup artist [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] and special effects supervisor [[John P. Fulton]] worked together closely, especially on Holden's make-up design. They combined special lighting with a greyish-green make-up for Holden's final scenes, creating a pallor that contrasted with the more normally flesh-toned make-ups of the others in the scene.<ref>''The New York Times'', \"Vampires, Monsters, Horrors!\" March 1, 1936. Quoted in White, pp. 147\u201348</ref> [[Heinz Roemheld]] composed the score<ref name=\"mank357\">Mank, p. 357</ref> and [[Albert S. D'Agostino]] redressed [[Charles D. Hall]]'s set of Dracula's castle and created new sets including a London bridge, the moor where Dracula's body is burned and Countess Zaleska's apartment.<ref>Bansak, et al., p. 113</ref>\n\n==Reception and influence==\n''[[The New York Times]]'' gave ''Dracula's Daughter'' a solid, albeit somewhat tongue-in-cheek, review upon its release, citing the film's \"blood-curdling events\" and noting that \"Gloria Holden is a remarkably convincing bat-woman\" in concluding that the film is both \"quite terrifying\" and \"a cute little horror picture.\"<ref name = nyt>{{cite news \n | last = Nugent\n | first = Frank S.\n | title = THE SCREEN; ' Dracula's Daughter' Makes Her Debut at the Rialto and Proves She's a Chip Off the Old Block.\n | work = [[The New York Times]]\n | date = 1936-05-18\n | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&res=9E00EFDF1230E13BBC4052DFB366838D629EDE&partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes&oref=slogin\n | accessdate = 2008-11-03}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also praised the production and Holden's performance in particular.<ref>Clark, p. 188</ref> Despite critical approval, ''Dracula's Daughter'' did not have the same box office success as the original.\n\nLater reviews of ''Dracula's Daughter'' are sharply split. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', reviewing the film following its video release, called it \"one of the most satisfying vampire pictures ever made\". Describing director Hillyer's visuals as \"lush, evocative, and suffused with just the right gothic chiaroscuro\" and noting that \"Gloria Holden, as the reluctant vampire protagonist, absolutely drips patrician eroticism\", ''EW'' concludes that this film is better than Lugosi's original ''Dracula''.<ref name = ew>{{cite news \n | last = Simels\n | first = Steve\n | title = Dracula's Daughter\n | work = Entertainment Weekly\n | date = 1992-12-11\n | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20197299,00.html\n | accessdate = 2008-11-03}}</ref>\n\nRyan Cracknell of Apollo Movie Guide, while echoing the praise for Holden's performance, nonetheless found that the film \"doesn't hold up so well today\".

''Dracula's Daughter'' marked the first time that the trend was incorporated into a film.<ref>Tudor, p. 31</ref> The [[lesbian]] implications of ''Dracula's Daughter'' were obvious from the start and were of great concern to the Production Code Administration. PCA head Breen took special notice of the scene between the Countess and her model, Lili, writing, \"This will need very careful handling to avoid any questionable flavor.\"<ref name=\"worland126\">Breen, quoted in Worland, p. 126</ref> The day before the scene was to be shot, Universal's [[Harry Zehner]] asked Breen to read a draft of the scene. In response, Breen wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The present suggestion that ... Lili poses in the nude will be changed. She will be posing her neck and shoulders, and there will be no suggestion that she undresses, and there will be no exposure of her person. It was also stated that the present incomplete sequence will be followed by a scene in which Lili is taken to a hospital and there it will be definitely established that she has been attacked by a vampire. The whole sequence will be treated in such a way as to avoid any suggestion of perverse sexual desire on the part of Marya or of an attempted sexual attack by her upon Lili.<ref name=\"worland126\" /></blockquote>\n\nGay film historian [[Vito Russo]] noted in his book ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'' that Universal highlighted Countess Zaleska's attraction to women in some of its original advertising for the film, using the tag line \"Save the women of London from Dracula's Daughter!\" He further cited Countess Zaleska as an example of the presentation of the \"essence of homosexuality as a predatory weakness\".<ref>Russo, p. 48</ref> Some reviewers of the day picked up on and condemned the lesbian content, including the ''New York World-Telegram'' which noted the Countess's tendency to wander around \"giving the eye to sweet young girls\".<ref>quoted in Russo, p. 48</ref> Other reviews missed it entirely, including the aforementioned ''[[The New York Times]]'' which advised \"Be sure to bring the kiddies.\"<ref name=\"nyt\" /> ''Entertainment Weekly'' describes the encounter between the Countess and Lili as \"so hot it's impossible to imagine how it ever got past '30s censors\"<ref name=\"ew\" /> whereas ''Time Out London'' finds only a \"subtle suggestion\" of lesbianism.<ref>{{cite news\n |title=Dracula's Daughter \n |work=Time Out London \n |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65746/Draculas_Daughter.html \n |accessdate=2008-11-03 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206164857/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65746/Draculas_Daughter.html \n |archivedate=2009-02-06 \n}}</ref> Horror scholar Skal notes that the scene has come to be seen as a \"classic 'lesbian' sequence, although of a decidedly negative stripe\".<ref>Skal, p. 200</ref> The scene between Countess Zaleska and Lili was included in the 1995 [[documentary film]] adaptation of Russo's book.\n\nAnother lesbian-tinged scene which has received less critical attention comes when the Countess is holding Janet captive. Described as \"the longest kiss never filmed\", Countess Zaleska \"hovers lovingly over Janet ... hovers ... and hovers ... slowly descending to kiss the recumbent Janet{{nbsp}}...\"<ref>Hanson, pp. 198\u201399</ref> until interrupted by the arrival of Dr. Garth.\n\n''[[Bright Lights Film Journal]]'', after noting that \"Gloria Holden in the title role almost singlehandedly redefined the '20s movie vamp as an impressive Euro-butch dyke bloodsucker\", draws an implicit comparison between Countess Zaleska's seeking to cure her vampirism through psychiatry and the former position of mainstream psychiatry of homosexuality as a mental illness (a view still held by a minority in the profession). Zaleska's cruising the streets of London is seen as parallel to [[cruising for sex]] (although that tends to be a gay male activity) and as suggesting \"society's image of the lesbian as soulless predator\" but the conclusion is that \"Holden's striking, masklike face and haunting, luminous eyes [are] the intoxicating essence of transgressive lesbian power.\"<ref>{{cite news \n | last = Morris\n | first = Gary\n | title = Queer Horror: Decoding Universal's Monsters\n | work = Bright Lights Film Journal\n | date = December 1998\n | url = http://brightlightsfilm.com/23/universalhorror.php\n |accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Vampire films]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{Cite book |last=Abbott |first=Stacey |authorlink= |title=Celluloid Vampires: Life After Death in the Modern World |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2007 |location= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cBhLk-0PKAC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-292-71695-7}}\n* Bansak, Edmund G. and Robert Wise (2003).

Directed by [[Lambert Hillyer]] from a screenplay by [[Garrett Fort]], the film stars [[Otto Kruger]], [[Gloria Holden]] in the title role, [[Marguerite Churchill]] and features, as the only cast member to return from the original, [[Edward Van Sloan]] &ndash; although his character's name was altered from Van Helsing to ''Von'' Helsing.\n\n''Dracula's Daughter'' tells the story of Countess Marya Zaleska, the daughter of [[Count Dracula]] and herself a vampire. Following Dracula's death, she believes that by destroying his body she will be free of his influence and live normally. When this fails, she turns to a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth ([[Otto Kruger]]). He, in turn, has a fiance, Janet ([[Marguerite Churchill]]). The Countess kidnaps Janet and takes her to Transylvania, leading to a battle between Dr. Garth and the Countess in an attempt by him to save Janet.\n\nOstensibly based on a [[short story]] titled \"[[Dracula's Guest]]\" by [[Bram Stoker]], the film bears little or no resemblance to the original source material. [[David O. Selznick]] initially purchased the rights to the story for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Selznick, likely knowing he could not legally make the film because of Universal's copyright on the original film, sold the rights to Universal. After first assigning the picture to [[James Whale]], Universal production head [[Carl Laemmle, Jr.]] finally put Hillyer in the director's chair.\n\nWhile not as successful as the original upon its release, the film was generally well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been deeply divided. Contemporary critics and scholars have noted the film's strong lesbian overtones, which Universal acknowledged from the start of production and exploited in some early advertising.\n\n==Plot==\n''Dracula's Daughter'' begins a few moments after ''Dracula'' ends. [[Count Dracula]] has just been destroyed by [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Von Helsing]] <!--in this film the character's name is spelled VON Helsing so please do not change it -->([[Edward Van Sloan]]). Van Helsing is arrested by two Whitby policemen, Sergeant Wilkes ([[E. E. Clive]]) and constable Albert ([[Billy Bevan]]).  Von Helsing is sent by the Whitby police to [[Scotland Yard]], where he explains to Sir Basil Humphrey ([[Gilbert Emery]]) that he indeed did destroy Count Dracula, but because he had already been dead for over 500 years, it cannot be considered murder. Instead of hiring a lawyer, he enlists the aid of a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth ([[Otto Kruger]]), who was once one of his star students.\n\nSergeant Wilkes leaves the Whitby gaol to meet an officer from Scotland Yard at the train station. Meanwhile, Dracula's daughter, Countess Marya Zaleska ([[Gloria Holden]]), enters the gaol and mesmerizes Albert with her jeweled ring and with the aid of her manservant, Sandor ([[Irving Pichel]]), steals Dracula's body from the Whitby gaol and after tossing salt on the pyre ritualistically burns Dracula's body, hoping to break her curse of vampirism. However, Sandor soon begins to discourage her telling her that all that is in her eyes is \"death.\" She soon gives in to her thirst for blood. The Countess resumes her hunting, mesmerizing her victims with her exotic jeweled ring. After a chance meeting with Dr. Garth at a society party, the Countess asks him to help her overcome the influence she feels from beyond the grave. The doctor advises her to defeat her cravings by confronting them and the Countess becomes hopeful that her will, plus Dr. Garth's science, will be strong enough to overcome Dracula's malevolence.\n\nThe Countess sends Sandor to fetch her a model to paint.  He sees a pretty young woman, Lili ([[Nan Grey]]), and follows her onto a bridge.  The woman pauses at the railing looking despondent. Sandor promises her food, warmth and money.  She hesitates, but Sandor explains that he seeks her for his mistress. Lili returns with Sandor. Countess Zaleska initially resists her urges but succumbs and attacks her. Lili survives the attack and is examined by Dr. Garth through hypnosis; she reveals enough information to let Dr. Garth know that it was Countess Zaleska that attacked her, but suffers heart failure and dies. The Countess gives up fighting her urges and accepts that a cure is not possible; she lures Dr. Garth to [[Transylvania]] by kidnapping Janet Blake ([[Marguerite Churchill]]), his secretary, whom he has a playfully antagonistic relationship with, but now realizes that he cares for her. Zaleska intends to transform Dr. Garth into a vampire to be her eternal companion. Arriving at Castle Dracula in Transylvania, Dr. Garth agrees to exchange his life for Janet's. Before he can be transformed, Countess Zaleska is destroyed when Sandor shoots her through the heart with an arrow as revenge for her breaking her promise to make him immortal. He takes aim at Dr. Garth but is shot dead by a Scotland Yard policeman who, along with Von Helsing, have followed Dr. Garth from London.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gloria Holden]] as Countess Marya Zaleska - Dracula's Daughter\n* [[Otto Kruger]] as Dr. Jeffrey Garth\n* [[Marguerite Churchill]] as Janet Blake\n* [[Irving Pichel]] as Sandor\n* [[Gilbert Emery]] as Sir Basil Humphrey, Scotland Yard\n* [[Edward Van Sloan]]\t as [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Von Helsing]] <!--in this film the character's name is spelled VON Helsing so please do not change it -->\n* [[Halliwell Hobbes]] as Hawkins\n* [[Billy Bevan]] as Albert\n* [[Nan Grey]] as Lili\n* [[Hedda Hopper]] as Lady Esme Hammond\n* [[Claud Allister]] as Sir Aubrey\n* [[Edgar Norton]] as Hobbs\n* [[E.

[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] executive [[David O. Selznick]] negotiated a contract in 1933 with Stoker's widow, [[Florence Stoker|Florence]], to buy the rights to the chapter for an advance of $500 against a purchase price of $5,000. MGM's lawyers and executives were worried about the use of the word \"Dracula\" in the film's title, fearing that Universal would take legal action, although Selznick's contract with Stoker explicitly listed \"Dracula's Daughter\" as a possible alternative title. The project was code-named \"Tarantula\" in correspondence.<ref name=\"skal1968\" />\n\nSelznick hired [[John L. Balderston]], who had previously worked on the 1931 ''Dracula'' and ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', to write the screenplay. Balderston's screenplay involved tying up loose ends from the original film. In it, Von Helsing returns to Transylvania to destroy the [[Brides of Dracula|three vampire brides]] seen in ''Dracula'' but overlooks a fourth tomb concealing Dracula's daughter. She follows him back to London and operates under the name \"Countess Szekelsky\". She attacks a young aristocrat and Von Helsing and the aristocrat's fianc\u00e9e track her back to Transylvania and destroy her. The script included scenes that implied that Dracula's daughter enjoyed torturing her male victims and that while under her control the men liked it too. Also included were shots of the Countess's chambers being stocked with whips and straps, which she would never use on-screen but whose uses the audience could imagine. Regardless of any objections that the [[Production Code Administration]] (PCA) would have raised to many aspects of the scenario, Balderston's script could never have been filmed because Selznick's contract with Stoker expressly barred him from using any Bram Stoker characters that did not appear in \"[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories|Dracula's Guest]]\". Selznick re-sold the rights to \"Dracula's Guest\" to Universal in September 1935<ref name=\"skal1968\">Skal, pp. 196\u201398</ref> for $12,500, which included the rights to Balderston's scenario.<ref name=\"curtis260\">Curtis, p. 260</ref> Horror film scholar [[David J. Skal]] theorizes that this was Selznick's actual motivation in buying the rights in the first place, to profit from Universal's desire for a sequel by tying up the only obvious source material.<ref>Skal, p. 196</ref>\n\n===Director===\nUniversal studio head Carl Laemmle, Jr. (nicknamed \"Junior\") wanted [[James Whale]], fresh from his great success with ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', to direct ''Dracula's Daughter''. Whale was idle, waiting for [[Irene Dunne]] to finish work on ''[[Magnificent Obsession (1935 film)|Magnificent Obsession]]'' so she could begin work on Whale's ''[[Show Boat (1936 film)|Show Boat]]''. Wary of directing two horror films in a row, Whale instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a mystery novel called ''The Hangover Murders''. Laemmle agreed only after extracting a promise from Whale that he would direct ''Dracula's Daughter'' next.<ref>Curtis, pp. 254\u201355</ref> Whale completed work on the film, titled ''[[Remember Last Night?]]'' for release, on September 14, 1935.<ref>Curtis, p. 258</ref> ''Magnificent Obsession'' completed filming on October 29. With Dunne freed up, Whale went to work on ''Show Boat''. Laemmle replaced him with [[A. Edward Sutherland]], who was best known for his work on comedies. Sutherland had as little interest in ''Dracula's Daughter'' as Whale and soon left the studio,<ref>Curtis, pp. 260\u201361</ref> and Hillyer came on to direct.\n\n===Universal script===\nThe earliest scenario for the Universal film was written by [[R. C. Sherriff]]. It began with three scenes set in the 14th Century and centered on the Dracula legend. It then switched to the present day, focusing on two engaged couples who visit Transylvania. The men explore the ruins of Dracula's castle. One is later found, insane, and the other goes missing. Professor Von Helsing is summoned and he tracks the missing man to London, where he is in thrall to Dracula's daughter, the Countess Szelinski (sic). When she attempts to flee with her thrall to the Orient by ship, Von Helsing and three others book passage on the same ship. During a violent storm, Von Helsing destroys Dracula's daughter and, with her hold over the men broken, the scenario closes with a double wedding. This version was submitted on August 28, 1935 to the [[British Board of Film Censors]], which rejected it, saying in part \"...{{nbsp}}''Dracula's Daughter'' would require half a dozen ... languages to adequately express its beastliness.\" On September 10 Sherriff met with BBFC representatives and submitted a revised scenario two days later. This scenario was passed but because its details were not recorded by the BBFC it is unknown how much it differed from the original or how much if any of that scenario was retained in the final script.<ref>Robertson pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nUniversal also submitted Sheriff's first draft to the PCA on September 5, 1935 and encountered stronger resistance from PCA enforcer [[Joseph Breen]] than it had from the British. Breen reported back that the script \"contains countless offensive stuff which makes the picture utterly impossible for approval under the Production Code\".<ref>Breen, quoted in Skal, p. 198</ref> A second draft was submitted on October 21, but it too was rejected, with many of Breen's objections centering on the 14th Century scenes in which Dracula himself appeared. It is unclear whether this submission was the same submission that the BBFC had previously passed. A third Sheriff draft was submitted three days later and Sherriff's fourth and final draft on November 10. All remained unacceptable, and Whale biographer James Curtis suggests that Whale, who had no interest in the project and feared that his commitment to it might cost him control over the filming of ''Show Boat'', encouraged Sherriff to submit ever more wildly unacceptable versions in hopes of getting himself off the film.<ref name=\"curtis260\" /> On January 14, 1936, producer [[E. M. Asher]] advised Breen that the Sherriff script was not going to be used and that a new script would be put together from scratch. Screenwriting duties were assigned to Garrett Fort.<ref>Skal, pp. 198\u201399</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:GloriaHolden2DraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg|thumb|right|Gloria Holden]]\n[[File:OttoKrugerDraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n''Dracula's Daughter'' was Gloria Holden's first starring role and reportedly she was extremely displeased at having been assigned it. Like many actors, Holden looked down on horror films. She had also seen [[Bela Lugosi]] struggle over the years since ''Dracula'' was made to free himself from [[Typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] and feared that the role would lead to the same fate for her. Critic Mark Clark believes that ironically it may have been Holden's disgust for the role that led to the quality of her performance. \"Her disdain for the part translates into a kind of self-loathing that perfectly suits her troubled character.\"<ref>Clark, p. 184</ref>\n\nInitially Lugosi and [[Jane Wyatt]] were set to star in the film. Universal also announced that [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Colin Clive]], who had starred together in ''Frankenstein'' and ''Bride of Frankenstein'', would appear,<ref name=\"rhodes219\">Rhodes, p. 219</ref> and that [[Cesar Romero]] would play Dr. Garth.<ref name=\"mank365\">Mank, p. 365</ref> According to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Universal had sought [[Herbert Marshall]] for the role of Sandor, before casting Pichel.<ref name=\"mank365\" /> None of them appeared except, after a fashion, Lugosi, in the form of a wax bust molded in his image for use in Dracula's coffin. Some sources report that Lugosi was paid as much as $4,000 for his abortive involvement, but the only confirmed record of any financial arrangement is a letter in which Lugosi consents to the use of his likeness at no cost to create the wax bust.<ref name=\"rhodes219\" />\n\n===Shooting===\n[[File:Dracula's Daughter - Poster 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Theatrical poster]]\nShooting on ''Dracula's Daughter'' began on February 4, 1936, rushed into production before Fort had completed the script,<ref>Mank, p. 356</ref> because of a deadline clause in Universal's option of the property from Selznick.<ref>Skal, p. 199</ref> The script was not finalized until shooting had been underway for three weeks.<ref name=\"mank357\" /> The film was completed on March 10.<ref>Mank, p. 358</ref> Despite studio orders that the film be shot on a seven-day-per-week schedule,<ref name=\"mank357\" /> filming ran seven days over its schedule and $50,000 over budget, with the final cost of the film tallied at $278,380.<ref>Senn, p. 361</ref>\n\n''Dracula's Daughter'' was the last in the first cycle of [[Universal Horror]] films that reached back into the 1920s. Publicly, Universal said it was because a British ban on horror films would cut too deeply into the revenue such films could generate.<ref>Johnson, p. 7</ref> In truth, the cycle was suspended because, just before filming on ''Dracula's Daughter'' had wrapped, the Laemmle family had lost control of Universal. Because of cost overruns on a number of pictures, Junior Laemmle was forced to borrow $1,000,000 on November 1, 1935. The money came from [[J. Cheever Cowdin]], head of the [[Standard Capital Corporation]], and from [[Charles R. Rogers]]. When the loan was called in March of the following year, Universal was unable to repay it. Standard assumed control of the studio on March 4 and Rogers replaced Junior as head of production. Rogers did not like horror films and he shut down production on them following the release of ''Dracula's Daughter'' to focus on fare like [[Deanna Durbin]] musicals.<ref>Johnson, p. 129</ref> Universal would not return to the horror genre for three years, when it released ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' in 1939.\n\n===Other production aspects===\nMakeup artist [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] and special effects supervisor [[John P. Fulton]] worked together closely, especially on Holden's make-up design. They combined special lighting with a greyish-green make-up for Holden's final scenes, creating a pallor that contrasted with the more normally flesh-toned make-ups of the others in the scene.<ref>''The New York Times'', \"Vampires, Monsters, Horrors!\" March 1, 1936. Quoted in White, pp. 147\u201348</ref> [[Heinz Roemheld]] composed the score<ref name=\"mank357\">Mank, p. 357</ref> and [[Albert S. D'Agostino]] redressed [[Charles D. Hall]]'s set of Dracula's castle and created new sets including a London bridge, the moor where Dracula's body is burned and Countess Zaleska's apartment.<ref>Bansak, et al., p. 113</ref>\n\n==Reception and influence==\n''[[The New York Times]]'' gave ''Dracula's Daughter'' a solid, albeit somewhat tongue-in-cheek, review upon its release, citing the film's \"blood-curdling events\" and noting that \"Gloria Holden is a remarkably convincing bat-woman\" in concluding that the film is both \"quite terrifying\" and \"a cute little horror picture.\"<ref name = nyt>{{cite news \n | last = Nugent\n | first = Frank S.\n | title = THE SCREEN; ' Dracula's Daughter' Makes Her Debut at the Rialto and Proves She's a Chip Off the Old Block.\n | work = [[The New York Times]]\n | date = 1936-05-18\n | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&res=9E00EFDF1230E13BBC4052DFB366838D629EDE&partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes&oref=slogin\n | accessdate = 2008-11-03}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also praised the production and Holden's performance in particular.<ref>Clark, p. 188</ref> Despite critical approval, ''Dracula's Daughter'' did not have the same box office success as the original.\n\nLater reviews of ''Dracula's Daughter'' are sharply split. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', reviewing the film following its video release, called it \"one of the most satisfying vampire pictures ever made\". Describing director Hillyer's visuals as \"lush, evocative, and suffused with just the right gothic chiaroscuro\" and noting that \"Gloria Holden, as the reluctant vampire protagonist, absolutely drips patrician eroticism\", ''EW'' concludes that this film is better than Lugosi's original ''Dracula''.<ref name = ew>{{cite news \n | last = Simels\n | first = Steve\n | title = Dracula's Daughter\n | work = Entertainment Weekly\n | date = 1992-12-11\n | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20197299,00.html\n | accessdate = 2008-11-03}}</ref>\n\nRyan Cracknell of Apollo Movie Guide, while echoing the praise for Holden's performance, nonetheless found that the film \"doesn't hold up so well today\". Citing what he sees as slow pacing and \"long bouts of over-the-top dialogue\", Cracknell compares the film to \"reading a textbook \u2013 not the most exciting thing in the world, but it does provide insights into and perspectives on the foundation of early horror movies and how many similarities carry over into movies half a century and more later.\"<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Cracknell \n |first=Ryan \n |title=Dracula's Daughter \n |publisher=Apollo Movie Guide \n |url=http://apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=3389&Specific=4076 \n |accessdate=2008-11-07 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206230627/http://apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=3389&Specific=4076 \n |archivedate=2009-02-06 \n}}</ref> Michael W.

''Dracula's Daughter'' marked the first time that the trend was incorporated into a film.<ref>Tudor, p. 31</ref> The [[lesbian]] implications of ''Dracula's Daughter'' were obvious from the start and were of great concern to the Production Code Administration. PCA head Breen took special notice of the scene between the Countess and her model, Lili, writing, \"This will need very careful handling to avoid any questionable flavor.\"<ref name=\"worland126\">Breen, quoted in Worland, p. 126</ref> The day before the scene was to be shot, Universal's [[Harry Zehner]] asked Breen to read a draft of the scene. In response, Breen wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The present suggestion that ... Lili poses in the nude will be changed. She will be posing her neck and shoulders, and there will be no suggestion that she undresses, and there will be no exposure of her person. It was also stated that the present incomplete sequence will be followed by a scene in which Lili is taken to a hospital and there it will be definitely established that she has been attacked by a vampire. The whole sequence will be treated in such a way as to avoid any suggestion of perverse sexual desire on the part of Marya or of an attempted sexual attack by her upon Lili.<ref name=\"worland126\" /></blockquote>\n\nGay film historian [[Vito Russo]] noted in his book ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'' that Universal highlighted Countess Zaleska's attraction to women in some of its original advertising for the film, using the tag line \"Save the women of London from Dracula's Daughter!\" He further cited Countess Zaleska as an example of the presentation of the \"essence of homosexuality as a predatory weakness\".<ref>Russo, p. 48</ref> Some reviewers of the day picked up on and condemned the lesbian content, including the ''New York World-Telegram'' which noted the Countess's tendency to wander around \"giving the eye to sweet young girls\".<ref>quoted in Russo, p. 48</ref> Other reviews missed it entirely, including the aforementioned ''[[The New York Times]]'' which advised \"Be sure to bring the kiddies.\"<ref name=\"nyt\" /> ''Entertainment Weekly'' describes the encounter between the Countess and Lili as \"so hot it's impossible to imagine how it ever got past '30s censors\"<ref name=\"ew\" /> whereas ''Time Out London'' finds only a \"subtle suggestion\" of lesbianism.<ref>{{cite news\n |title=Dracula's Daughter \n |work=Time Out London \n |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65746/Draculas_Daughter.html \n |accessdate=2008-11-03 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206164857/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65746/Draculas_Daughter.html \n |archivedate=2009-02-06 \n}}</ref> Horror scholar Skal notes that the scene has come to be seen as a \"classic 'lesbian' sequence, although of a decidedly negative stripe\".<ref>Skal, p. 200</ref> The scene between Countess Zaleska and Lili was included in the 1995 [[documentary film]] adaptation of Russo's book.\n\nAnother lesbian-tinged scene which has received less critical attention comes when the Countess is holding Janet captive.

''Tomie'' was Ito's first published work he originally submitted to ''Monthly Halloween'', a [[Sh\u014djo manga#Sh\u014djo magazines in Japan|''sh\u014djo'' magazine]] in 1987, which led to him winning the [[Kazuo Umezu]] award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vagabondedlife.tumblr.com/post/19759189727/the-junji-ito-interview-a-conversation-with-the#notes|title=The Junji Ito Interview|accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe manga has been adapted into a live action [[Tomie (film series)|film series]] with eight installments to date, and an anthology [[Tomie: Another Face|TV series]] released in 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nThe manga centers on the titular character: a mysterious, beautiful woman named [[Tomie Kawakami]], identified by her sleek black hair and a [[beauty mark]] below her left eye. \n\nTomie acts like a [[succubus]], possessing an undisclosed power to make any man fall in love with her. Through her mere presence, or through [[psychological manipulation|psychological and emotional manipulation]], she drives these men into jealous rages that often lead to brutal acts of violence. Men kill each other over her, and women are driven to insanity as well \u2014 though there are some who are strong enough to resist her. Tomie is inevitably killed time and time again, only to regenerate and spread her curse to other victims, making her effectively immortal. Her origins are never explained, though it is suggested by some older men in the series that she has existed long before the events of the manga.\n\nEach story showcases various characters that encounter Tomie in her many (often hideous) forms, with some having their own arcs or returning in later chapters. Tomie's regenerative abilities (partly fuelled by [[cannibalism]]) are also showcased: aside from recovering quickly from gruesome and seemingly mortal wounds, she can also replicate herself by sprouting unnaturally from any part of her body, whether it be from severed limbs, organs, or even her spilt blood. Radiation accelerates her healing/regeneration process. Her cells are also capable of transforming a victim into a Tomie via an organ transplant. Multiple characters are even driven to dismember her corpse, unwittingly allowing more Tomie copies to grow and spread throughout the world. Even locks of her hair are dangerous; burrowing into its victim's brain to possess them, and eventually kill them when it grows wildly within the body. It is also shown that even if Tomie's body is not injured, her body will attempt to sprout another Tomie through [[tumor]]ous growths, usually when she is emotionally stressed. Some Tomie copies, however, cannot stand one another; one is seen killing one personally, while others order it done through the boys they seduce/enslave. Fire is the only known method to destroy a Tomie for good, though only if the flesh is completely carbonized.\n\nThe next story arc reveals that a baby girl can grow naturally into a Tomie via a blood injection, and that she can age if she has not yet copied herself. The man responsible for these injections is a horribly burnt stranger \u2014 once a supermodel disgraced by a Tomie in his past \u2014 who seeks revenge by making one of these \"natural\" Tomies old and ugly. He manages to encase a Tomie named \"Ayaka\" in a block of cement with the help of Ayaka's older sister. The two then wait for many years \u2014 endlessly hearing her tormented cries \u2014 before finally breaking the block, revealing that Tomie had somehow escaped through a tiny crack, her apparent wailing being nothing more than wind blowing through the hollow block.\n\nAn arc released excusively with the DVD release of the ''[[Junji Ito Collection]]'', titled ''Tomie: Takeover'', features Tomie encountering a man so [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] that she is unable to take control over him, resulting in Tomie doubting her own attraction.\n\nA four-page [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] arc with [[Souichi Tsujii]], titled ''Souichi Possessed'', was released in 2018. In the story, the titular's Souichi's older brother Koichi tells a younger Tomie of his attempted [[villain]] of a brother's encounter with a different elderly Tomie, the arc serving as the [[prologue]] to a larger confrontation between the pair, as the younger Tomie requests an introduction.\n\n==Publication==\n{{main|List of Tomie chapters}}\n\n''Tomie'' is published by [[Asahi Sonorama]] and appeared as a [[Serial (literature)|serial]] in the [[List of manga magazines|manga magazine]] ''Monthly Halloween'' from 1987 to 2000.

There are to date eight films in the series.\n\nThe films manage to recreate the atmosphere of the manga. Most of the manga stories occur during the dark of night for its sense of eeriness, and the films generally follow suit.\n\nTwo episodes were adapted for the ''[[Junji Ito Collection]]''. \n\nTomie's sexuality in films is more ambiguous.

''Tomie'' was Ito's first published work he originally submitted to ''Monthly Halloween'', a [[Sh\u014djo manga#Sh\u014djo magazines in Japan|''sh\u014djo'' magazine]] in 1987, which led to him winning the [[Kazuo Umezu]] award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vagabondedlife.tumblr.com/post/19759189727/the-junji-ito-interview-a-conversation-with-the#notes|title=The Junji Ito Interview|accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe manga has been adapted into a live action [[Tomie (film series)|film series]] with eight installments to date, and an anthology [[Tomie: Another Face|TV series]] released in 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nThe manga centers on the titular character: a mysterious, beautiful woman named [[Tomie Kawakami]], identified by her sleek black hair and a [[beauty mark]] below her left eye. \n\nTomie acts like a [[succubus]], possessing an undisclosed power to make any man fall in love with her. Through her mere presence, or through [[psychological manipulation|psychological and emotional manipulation]], she drives these men into jealous rages that often lead to brutal acts of violence. Men kill each other over her, and women are driven to insanity as well \u2014 though there are some who are strong enough to resist her. Tomie is inevitably killed time and time again, only to regenerate and spread her curse to other victims, making her effectively immortal. Her origins are never explained, though it is suggested by some older men in the series that she has existed long before the events of the manga.\n\nEach story showcases various characters that encounter Tomie in her many (often hideous) forms, with some having their own arcs or returning in later chapters. Tomie's regenerative abilities (partly fuelled by [[cannibalism]]) are also showcased: aside from recovering quickly from gruesome and seemingly mortal wounds, she can also replicate herself by sprouting unnaturally from any part of her body, whether it be from severed limbs, organs, or even her spilt blood. Radiation accelerates her healing/regeneration process. Her cells are also capable of transforming a victim into a Tomie via an organ transplant. Multiple characters are even driven to dismember her corpse, unwittingly allowing more Tomie copies to grow and spread throughout the world. Even locks of her hair are dangerous; burrowing into its victim's brain to possess them, and eventually kill them when it grows wildly within the body. It is also shown that even if Tomie's body is not injured, her body will attempt to sprout another Tomie through [[tumor]]ous growths, usually when she is emotionally stressed. Some Tomie copies, however, cannot stand one another; one is seen killing one personally, while others order it done through the boys they seduce/enslave. Fire is the only known method to destroy a Tomie for good, though only if the flesh is completely carbonized.\n\nThe final story arc reveals that a baby girl can grow naturally into a Tomie via a blood injection, and that she can age if she has not yet copied herself. The man responsible for these injections is a horribly burnt stranger \u2014 once a supermodel disgraced by a Tomie in his past \u2014 who seeks revenge by making one of these \"natural\" Tomies old and ugly. He manages to encase a Tomie named \"Ayaka\" in a block of cement with the help of Ayaka's older sister. The two then wait for many years \u2014 endlessly hearing her tormented cries \u2014 before finally breaking the block, revealing that Tomie had somehow escaped through a tiny crack, her apparent wailing being nothing more than wind blowing through the hollow block.\n\nA four-page [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] arc with [[Souichi Tsujii]], titled ''Souichi Possessed'', was released in 2018. In the story, the titular's Souichi's older brother Koichi tells a younger Tomie of his attempted [[villain]] of a brother's encounter with a different elderly Tomie, the arc serving as the [[prologue]] to a larger confrontation between the pair, as the younger Tomie requests an introduction.\n\n==Publication==\n{{main|List of Tomie chapters}}\n\n''Tomie'' is published by [[Asahi Sonorama]] and appeared as a [[Serial (literature)|serial]] in the [[List of manga magazines|manga magazine]] ''Monthly Halloween'' from 1987 to 2000.

The film tells the story of Jack Burton, who helps his friend Wang Chi rescue Wang's [[Eye color#Green|green-eyed]] fianc\u00e9e from bandits in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown]]. They go into the mysterious underworld beneath Chinatown, where they face an ancient sorcerer named David Lo Pan, who requires a woman with green eyes to marry him in order to release him from a centuries-old curse.\n\nAlthough the original screenplay by first-time screenwriters [[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary Goldman]] and David Z. Weinstein was envisioned as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] set in the 1880s, screenwriter [[W. D. Richter]] was hired to rewrite the script extensively and modernize it. The studio hired Carpenter to direct the film and rushed ''Big Trouble in Little China'' into production so that it would be released before a similarly themed [[Eddie Murphy]] film, ''[[The Golden Child]]'', which was slated to come out around the same time. The project fulfilled Carpenter's long-standing desire to make a martial arts film.\n\nThe film was a commercial failure, grossing $11.1 million in North America, below its estimated $19 to $25 million budget. It received mixed reviews that left Carpenter disillusioned with [[Hollywood]] and influenced his decision to return to independent filmmaking. It has since become a [[cult following|cult classic]] and has a 79% average rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and a steady audience on [[home video]].\n\n==Plot==\nBig-talking rough-and-tumble truck driver Jack Burton wins a bet with his restaurant owner friend Wang Chi. To make sure he follows through on payment, Jack accompanies him to the airport to pick up Wang's Chinese fianc\u00e9e Miao Yin. A Chinese street gang, the Lords of Death, tries to kidnap another Chinese girl at the airport, who is being met by her friend Gracie Law, intending to sell her as a sex slave. After Jack intervenes, they take Miao Yin instead.\n\nJack and Wang track the Lords of Death to the back alleys of Chinatown, where they find a funeral procession that quickly erupts into a battle between the Chang Sing and Wing Kong, two ancient Chinese warrior societies. When \"The Three Storms\" \u2013 Thunder, Rain, and Lightning, mighty warriors with weather-themed powers \u2013 appear, slaughtering the Chang Sing, Jack attempts to gun his big-rig through the crowd, but runs over David Lo Pan, a decrepit man directing the Three Storms. Horrified, Jack exits his truck, but finds Lo Pan unfazed and glowing with magic. Wang hurriedly guides Jack through the alleys; the two escape the carnage and mayhem, but Jack's truck is stolen.\n\nWang takes Jack to his restaurant, where they meet with Gracie, her journalist friend Margo, Wang's friend Eddie Lee, and magician Egg Shen, a local authority on mysticism and Lo Pan. They try to explain to an incredulous Jack (who only wants his truck back) the ancient knowledge and sorcery the Chinese brought with them to America. The group devises a plan to infiltrate a brothel, where they believe Miao Yin is held. They break in with some difficulty, but are interrupted by the Storms tearing off the ceiling and making off with Miao Yin, taking her to their master Lo Pan. Jack and Wang track down the front business used by Lo Pan and impersonate telephone repairmen to gain access, but are quickly subdued by Rain. After being tied up and beaten by Thunder, the two meet Lo Pan \u2013 however, he now appears as a crippled old man.\n\nWang tells Jack that Lo Pan needs a special green-eyed girl to break an ancient curse, and he intends to sacrifice Miao Yin. Centuries ago, Lo Pan, a great warrior and even greater wizard, was defeated in battle by the first sovereign emperor, [[Qin Shi Huang]]. The Emperor cursed Lo Pan with [[incorporeality]]; although Lo Pan can be temporarily granted a decrepit body by supplication to the gods, he must marry a woman with green eyes to appease Ching Dai, the God of the East, and sacrifice her to satisfy the Emperor. When Jack and Wang's friends attempt to save them, they are also captured. After getting the drop on Thunder, Jack, Wang, and Eddie escape and free many women kept in holding cells in the process. During the escape, a horrible orangutan-like monster recaptures Gracie before she escapes. Lo Pan notes that Gracie has green eyes, too, and decides to sacrifice Gracie while making Miao Yin his unwilling wife.\n\nWang and Jack regroup with the Chang Sing and Egg Shen, and as a group they enter a cavern to return to Lo Pan's headquarters. Egg pours each of the group a potent potion that Jack says makes him feel \"kind of invincible\". The group interrupts the wedding ceremony, which breaks out into a battle. Wang kills Rain in a sword duel, while Jack and Gracie chase the newly-alive Lo Pan. Wang joins them, and just when all seems lost, Jack kills Lo Pan with a skillful knife throw. Thunder \u2013 who had been distracted with Wang \u2013 reappears, and, enraged at finding Lo Pan dead, explodes. Jack, Wang, Gracie, and Miao Yin are cornered by Lightning in a corridor, who triggers a collapse with his powers. Egg rescues them with a rope and kills Lightning by dropping a stone Buddha statue on him when he tries to follow. After finding Jack's truck and dealing with the remaining Wing Kong guards, the group busts out and escapes back to Wang's restaurant.\n\nThe group celebrates their victory in the restaurant with the rescued women; Wang and Miao prepare to marry, while Eddie pairs with Margo. Egg sets off on a long-due vacation \u2013 Jack suggests his homeland, but Egg says that China is in the heart.

Weinstein. Goldman had been inspired by a new wave of martial arts films that had \"all sorts of weird actions and special effects, shot against this background of Oriental mysticism and modern sensibilities\".<ref name=\"Teitelbaum\">{{cite news |last = Teitelbaum |first = Sheldon |title = ''Big Trouble in Little China'' |work = [[Cinefantastique]] |pages = 4\u20135 |publisher = |date = July 1986}}</ref> They had written a Western originally set in the 1880s with Jack Burton as a cowboy who rides into town.<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\">{{cite news |last = Goldberg |first = Lee |title = W. D. Richter Writes Again |work = [[Starlog]] |date = June 1986}}</ref> Goldman and Weinstein envisioned what amounts to a [[Weird West]]ern, in this case, combining Chinese fantasy elements within an Old West setting.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum2\">Teitelbaum (July 1986), p. 5.</ref> They submitted the script to TAFT Entertainment Pictures executive producers [[Paul Monash]] and Keith Barish during the summer of 1982. Monash bought their script and had them do at least one rewrite but still did not like the results. He remembers, \"The problems came largely from the fact it was set in turn-of-the-century San Francisco, which affected everything\u2014style, dialogue, action\".<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/> Goldman rejected a request by [[20th Century Fox]] for a rewrite that asked for major alterations. He was angered when the studio wanted to update it to a contemporary setting. The studio then removed the writers from the project. However, they still wanted credit for their contributions.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum3\">Teitelbaum July 1986, p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe studio brought in screenwriter [[W. D. Richter]], a veteran [[script doctor]] (and director of ''[[The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension|The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai]]'') to extensively rewrite the script, as he felt that the Wild West and fantasy elements did not work together. The screenwriter modernized everything. Almost everything in the original script was discarded except for Lo Pan's story.<ref name=\"Goldberg2\">{{cite news |last = Goldberg |first = Lee |title = ''Big Trouble in Little China'' |work = [[Starlog]] |publisher = |date = May 1986}}</ref> Richter realized that \"what it needed wasn't a rewrite but a complete overhaul. It was a dreadful screenplay. This happens often when scripts are bought and there's no intention that the original writers will stay on\".<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/> Richter used ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' as his template, presenting \"the foreground story in a familiar context \u2013 rather than San Francisco at the turn-of-the-century, which distances the audience immediately \u2013 and just have one simple remove, the world underground, you have a much better chance of making direct contact with the audience\".<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/> He wrote his own draft in 10 weeks.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum2\"/> Goldman contacted Richter and suggested that he should not work on the project. Richter told him, \"I'm sorry the studio doesn't want to go forward with you guys, but my turning it down is not going to get you the job. They'll just hire someone else\".<ref name=\"Teitelbaum2\"/>\n\nFox wanted to deny Goldman and Weinstein writing credit, and eliminated their names from press releases.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum3\"/> They wanted only Richter to have credit.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum4\">Teitelbaum (July 1986), p. 58.</ref> In March 1986, the [[Writers Guild of America, West]] determined that \"written by\" credit would go to Goldman and Weinstein, based on the [[WGA screenwriting credit system]] which protects original writers.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum3\"/><ref name=\"Swires, Steve\">{{cite news |last = Swires |first = Steve |title = John Carpenter: Kung Fu, Hollywood Style |work = [[Starlog]] |pages = |language = |publisher = |date = August 1986}}</ref> However, Richter did get an \"adaptation by\" credit for his work on the script. Director John Carpenter was disappointed that Richter did not get a proper screenwriting credit because of the ruling. Carpenter made his own additions to Richter's rewrites, which included strengthening the Gracie Law role and linking her to Chinatown, removing a few action sequences due to budgetary restrictions and eliminating material deemed offensive to Chinese Americans. The characters in the film reminded Carpenter \"of the characters in ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' or ''[[His Girl Friday]]''. These are very 1930s, [[Howard Hawks]] people.\"<ref name=\"Goldberg2\"/> The rapid-fire delivery of dialogue, especially between Jack Burton and Gracie Law, is an example of what the director is referring to.<ref name=\"Goldberg2\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nBarish and Monash first offered the project to Carpenter in July 1985. He had read the Goldman/Weinstein script and deemed it \"outrageously unreadable though it had many interesting elements\".<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/> To compete with rival production ''[[The Golden Child]]''\u2019s casting of box office draw [[Eddie Murphy]], Carpenter wanted a big star of his own and both [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Jack Nicholson]] were considered but were busy.<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/>\n\nThe studio felt Kurt Russell was an up-and-coming star. Russell was initially not interested because he felt there were \"a number of different ways to approach Jack, but I didn't know if there was a way that would be interesting enough for this movie\".<ref name=\"Goldberg3\">{{cite news| last = Goldberg| first = Lee| title = Kurt Russell: Two-Fisted Hero| work = [[Starlog]]| language =| publisher =| date = July 1986| accessdate = }}</ref> After talking to Carpenter and reading the script a couple  of more times, he gained insight into the character and liked the notion of playing \"a hero who has so many faults. Jack is and isn't the hero. He falls on his ass as much as he comes through. This guy is a real blowhard. He's a lot of hot air, very self-assured, a screw-up\".<ref name=\"Goldberg3\"/> Furthermore, the actor felt that \"at heart he thinks he's [[Indiana Jones]] but the circumstances are always too much for him\".<ref name=\"Scott, Vernon\">{{cite news| last = Scott| first = Vernon| title = Kurt as Klutz| work = United Press International| pages =| publisher =| date = July 9, 1986}}</ref> Russell felt that the film would be a hard one to market. \"This is a difficult picture to sell because it's hard to explain. It's a mixture of the real history of Chinatown in San Francisco blended with Chinese legend and lore. It's bizarre stuff. There are only a handful of non-Asian actors in the cast\".<ref name=\"Scott, Vernon\"/>\n\nJohn Carpenter had seen Dennis Dun in ''[[Year of the Dragon (film)|Year of the Dragon]]'' and liked his work in that film. He met the actor twice before casting him in the role of Wang Chi only a few days before principal photography.<ref name=\"Dickholtz, Daniel\">{{cite news |last = Dickholtz |first = Daniel |title = Dennis Dun, Kung Fu Hero |work = [[Starlog]] |publisher = |date = September 1986}}</ref> The martial arts sequences were not hard for Dun who had \"dabbled\" in training as a kid and done Chinese opera as an adult.<ref name=\"Dickholtz, Daniel\"/> He was drawn to the portrayal of Asian characters in the movie as he said, \"I\u2019m seeing Chinese actors getting to do stuff that American movies usually don\u2019t let them do. I\u2019ve never seen this type of role for an Asian in an American film\".<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/> [[Jackie Chan]] was at one point considered for the role of Wang Chi but decided after the box office disasters of ''[[The Big Brawl]]'' and ''[[The Protector (1985 film)|The Protector]]'' he should put more time and effort into his career in [[Hong Kong]]'s film industry with ''[[Police Story (1985 film)|Police Story]]'' instead.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe studio pressured Carpenter to cast a rock star in the role of Gracie Law, Jack Burton's love interest, but Carpenter wanted Kim Cattrall. The studio was not keen on the idea because at the time Cattrall was primarily known for raunchy comedies like ''[[Porky's]]'' and ''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]''. She was drawn to the film because of the way her character was portrayed. \"I'm not screaming for help the whole time. I think the humor comes out of the situations and my relationship with Jack Burton. I\u2019m the brains and he's the brawn\".<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/>\n\n===Principal photography===\nKurt Russell lifted weights and began running two months before production began to prepare for the physical demands of principal photography. In addition, Carpenter and his cast and crew did a week's rehearsals that mainly involved choreographing the martial arts scenes.<ref name=\"Steranko\">{{cite news |last = Steranko |first = Jim |title = The Trouble with Kurt |work = Prevue |pages = 73 | publisher = | date = August 1986}}</ref> 20th Century Fox was afraid that the production would create major overruns and hired Carpenter to direct because he could work fast. He was given only 10 weeks of pre-production.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum3\"/>\n\nProblems began to arise when Carpenter learned that the next Eddie Murphy vehicle, ''The Golden Child'', featured a similar theme and was going to be released around the same time as ''Big Trouble in Little China''. (As it happened, Carpenter was asked by [[Paramount Pictures]] to direct ''The Golden Child''). He remarked in an interview, \"How many adventure pictures dealing with Chinese mysticism have been released by the major studios in the past 20 years? For two of them to come along at the exact same time is more than mere coincidence.\"<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/> To beat the rival production at being released in theaters, ''Big Trouble'' went into production in October 1985 so it could open in July 1986, five months before ''The Golden Child''{{'}}s Christmas release.\n\nAlthough the early exterior establishing scenes were filmed on location in Chinatown,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nortonsmoviemaps.com/blog/big-trouble-in-little-china |title=Big Trouble in Little China |author=Larson, Erika |date=February 5, 2015 |website=Norton's Movie Maps [blog] |accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref> most of the film was shot on sets built in the [[20th Century Studios|Fox lot]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://ew.com/comic-con/2016/07/16/big-trouble-little-china-oral-history/ |title=Big Trouble in Little China oral history |author=Collis, Clark |date=July 16, 2016 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=21 January 2020}}</ref> Production designer John Lloyd designed the elaborate underground sets and recreated Chinatown with three-story buildings, roads, streetlights, sewers and so on. This was necessary for the staging of complicated special effects and kung fu fight sequences that would have been very hard to do on location.<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/> This forced the filmmaker to shoot the film in 15 weeks with a $25 million budget. For the film's many fight scenes Carpenter worked with martial arts choreographer [[James Lew]], who planned out every move in advance. Says Carpenter, \"I used every cheap gag \u2013 trampolines, wires, reverse movements and upside down sets. It was much like photographing a dance.\"<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/>\n\nCarpenter envisioned the film as an inverse of traditional scenarios in action films with a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] protagonist helped by a minority sidekick. In ''Big Trouble in Little China'', Jack Burton, despite his bravado, is constantly portrayed as rather bumbling; in one fight sequence, he knocks himself unconscious before the fight begins. Wang Chi, on the other hand, is constantly portrayed as highly skilled and competent. On a [[audio commentary|commentary track]] for the DVD release, Carpenter said the film is really about a sidekick (Burton) who thinks he is a leading man. According to Carpenter, the studio \"didn't get it\"<ref name=\"Nichols\">{{cite news |last = Nichols |first = Peter M |title = ''Big Trouble'': Big Comeback |work = [[The New York Times]] |publisher = |date = May 25, 2001 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/25/movies/home-video-big-trouble-big-comeback.html?sq=%22Big+Trouble+in+Little+China%22&scp=1&st=nyt |accessdate = 2008-12-02}}</ref> and made him write something that would explain the character of Jack Burton.

[[Richard Edlund]], head of Boss Film Studios, said that there were no difficulties with the company's workload and that ''Big Trouble'' was probably its favorite film at the time, with the exception of ''[[Ghostbusters]]''.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum4\"/> The effects budget for the film was just under $2 million, which Edlund said was barely adequate. One of the more difficult effects was the floating eyeball, a spy for Lo-Pan. It was powered by several puppeteers and dozens of cables to control its facial expressions. It was shot with a special matting system specially designed for it.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum4\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Big Trouble in Little China (soundtrack)}}\nJohn Carpenter received a Saturn Award Best Music nomination for this film.<ref>{{IMDb title|90728|section=awards}}</ref> With the soundtrack, Carpenter wanted to avoid the usual clich\u00e9s as he found that \"other scores for American movies about Chinese characters are basically rinky tink, chop suey music.

On the DVD commentary for ''Big Trouble in Little China'', Carpenter and Russell discuss this among possible reasons for the film's disappointing box office gross.\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]] that collects both contemporary and modern reviews, the film has a 77% approval rating based on 43 reviews; the average rating is 6.66/10.

(In traditional Chinese and Japanese culture, the lightning god is represented more akin to a traditional Asian demon.) Additionally, the character David Lo Pan has been credited as the original inspiration for the soul-stealing Mortal Kombat villain [[Shang Tsung]].\n\nThe twenty-third episode of [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series, season 2)|the second season]] of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|2012 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' TV series]], called \"A Chinatown Ghost Story\", uses concepts from the film, but renames the antagonist Lo Pan to Ho Chan, and the Storm figure Rain is replaced by Wind.

The film tells the story of Jack Burton, who helps his friend Wang Chi rescue Wang's [[Eye color#Green|green-eyed]] fianc\u00e9e from bandits in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown]]. They go into the mysterious underworld beneath Chinatown, where they face an ancient sorcerer named David Lo Pan, who requires a woman with green eyes to marry him in order to release him from a centuries-old curse.\n\nAlthough the original screenplay by first-time screenwriters [[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary Goldman]] and David Z. Weinstein was envisioned as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] set in the 1880s, screenwriter [[W. D. Richter]] was hired to rewrite the script extensively and modernize it. The studio hired Carpenter to direct the film and rushed ''Big Trouble in Little China'' into production so that it would be released before a similarly themed [[Eddie Murphy]] film, ''[[The Golden Child]]'', which was slated to come out around the same time. The project fulfilled Carpenter's long-standing desire to make a martial arts film.\n\nThe film was a commercial failure, grossing $11.1 million in North America, below its estimated $19 to $25 million budget. It received mixed reviews that left Carpenter disillusioned with [[Hollywood]] and influenced his decision to return to independent filmmaking. It has since become a [[cult following|cult classic]] and has a 79% average rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and a steady audience on [[home video]].\n\n==Plot==\nBig-talking rough-and-tumble truck driver Jack Burton wins a bet with his restaurant owner friend Wang Chi. To make sure he follows through on payment, Jack accompanies him to the airport to pick up Wang's Chinese fianc\u00e9e Miao Yin. A Chinese street gang, the Lords of Death, tries to kidnap another Chinese girl at the airport, who is being met by her friend Gracie Law, intending to sell her as a sex slave. After Jack intervenes, they take Miao Yin instead.\n\nJack and Wang track the Lords of Death to the back alleys of Chinatown, where they find a funeral procession that quickly erupts into a battle between the Chang Sing and Wing Kong, two ancient Chinese warrior societies. When \"The Three Storms\" \u2013 Thunder, Rain, and Lightning, mighty warriors with weather-themed powers \u2013 appear, slaughtering the Chang Sing, Jack attempts to gun his big-rig through the crowd, but runs over David Lo Pan, a decrepit man directing the Three Storms. Horrified, Jack exits his truck, but finds Lo Pan unfazed and glowing with magic. Wang hurriedly guides Jack through the alleys; the two escape the carnage and mayhem, but Jack's truck is stolen.\n\nWang takes Jack to his restaurant, where they meet with Gracie, her journalist friend Margo, Wang's friend Eddie Lee, and magician Egg Shen, a local authority on mysticism and Lo Pan. They try to explain to an incredulous Jack (who only wants his truck back) the ancient knowledge and sorcery the Chinese brought with them to America. The group devises a plan to infiltrate a brothel, where they believe Miao Yin is held. They break in with some difficulty, but are interrupted by the Storms tearing off the ceiling and making off with Miao Yin, taking her to their master Lo Pan. Jack and Wang track down the front business used by Lo Pan and impersonate telephone repairmen to gain access, but are quickly subdued by Rain. After being tied up and beaten by Thunder, the two meet Lo Pan \u2013 however, he now appears as a crippled old man.\n\nWang tells Jack that Lo Pan needs a special green-eyed girl to break an ancient curse, and he intends to sacrifice Miao Yin. Centuries ago, Lo Pan, a great warrior and even greater wizard, was defeated in battle by the first sovereign emperor, [[Qin Shi Huang]]. The Emperor cursed Lo Pan with [[incorporeality]]; although Lo Pan can be temporarily granted a decrepit body by supplication to the gods, he must marry a woman with green eyes to appease Ching Dai, the God of the East, and sacrifice her to satisfy the Emperor. When Jack and Wang's friends attempt to save them, they are also captured. After getting the drop on Thunder, Jack, Wang, and Eddie escape and free many women kept in holding cells in the process. During the escape, a horrible orangutan-like monster recaptures Gracie before she escapes. Lo Pan notes that Gracie has green eyes, too, and decides to sacrifice Gracie while making Miao Yin his unwilling wife.\n\nWang and Jack regroup with the Chang Sing and Egg Shen, and as a group they enter a cavern to return to Lo Pan's headquarters. Egg pours each of the group a potent potion that Jack says makes him feel \"kind of invincible\". The group interrupts the wedding ceremony, which breaks out into a battle. Wang kills Rain in a sword duel, while Jack and Gracie chase the newly-alive Lo Pan. Wang joins them, and just when all seems lost, Jack kills Lo Pan with a skillful knife throw. Thunder \u2013 who had been distracted with Wang \u2013 reappears, and, enraged at finding Lo Pan dead, explodes. Jack, Wang, Gracie, and Miao Yin are cornered by Lightning in a corridor, who triggers a collapse with his powers. Egg rescues them with a rope and kills Lightning by dropping a stone Buddha statue on him when he tries to follow. After finding Jack's truck and dealing with the remaining Wing Kong guards, the group busts out and escapes back to Wang's restaurant.\n\nThe group celebrates their victory in the restaurant with the rescued women; Wang and Miao prepare to marry, while Eddie pairs with Margo. Egg sets off on a long-due vacation \u2013 Jack suggests his homeland, but Egg says that China is in the heart. Though Gracie offers to join him in his travels, Jack decides to keep on trucking alone and give himself time to decide. Unbeknownst to him, the orangutan-like monster survived the battle in the labyrinth and has stowed away on his truck.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=}}\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Jack Burton, a cocky, wise-cracking, All-American truck driver who gets involved in an ancient battle between Good and Evil when he makes a delivery to [[Chinatown, San Francisco]].\n* [[Kim Cattrall]] as Gracie Law, a lawyer who is Jack's love interest.\n* [[Dennis Dun]] as Wang Chi, Jack's best friend and restaurant owner whose fianc\u00e9e is kidnapped by Lo Pan.\n* [[James Hong]] as David Lo Pan, an underground emperor who lost a bet to an unknown person and was cursed, making him a ghost.

[[Noble Craig]] appears as \"Sewer Monster\".\n\n==Production==\n\n===Screenplay===\nThe first version of the screenplay was written by first-time screenwriters [[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary Goldman]] and David Z. Weinstein. Goldman had been inspired by a new wave of martial arts films that had \"all sorts of weird actions and special effects, shot against this background of Oriental mysticism and modern sensibilities\".<ref name=\"Teitelbaum\">{{cite news |last = Teitelbaum |first = Sheldon |title = ''Big Trouble in Little China'' |work = [[Cinefantastique]] |pages = 4\u20135 |publisher = |date = July 1986}}</ref> They had written a Western originally set in the 1880s with Jack Burton as a cowboy who rides into town.<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\">{{cite news |last = Goldberg |first = Lee |title = W. D. Richter Writes Again |work = [[Starlog]] |date = June 1986}}</ref> Goldman and Weinstein envisioned what amounts to a [[Weird West]]ern, in this case, combining Chinese fantasy elements within an Old West setting.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum2\">Teitelbaum (July 1986), p. 5.</ref> They submitted the script to TAFT Entertainment Pictures executive producers [[Paul Monash]] and Keith Barish during the summer of 1982. Monash bought their script and had them do at least one rewrite but still did not like the results. He remembers, \"The problems came largely from the fact it was set in turn-of-the-century San Francisco, which affected everything\u2014style, dialogue, action\".<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/> Goldman rejected a request by [[20th Century Fox]] for a rewrite that asked for major alterations. He was angered when the studio wanted to update it to a contemporary setting. The studio then removed the writers from the project. However, they still wanted credit for their contributions.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum3\">Teitelbaum July 1986, p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe studio brought in screenwriter [[W. D. Richter]], a veteran [[script doctor]] (and director of ''[[The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension|The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai]]'') to extensively rewrite the script, as he felt that the Wild West and fantasy elements did not work together. The screenwriter modernized everything. Almost everything in the original script was discarded except for Lo Pan's story.<ref name=\"Goldberg2\">{{cite news |last = Goldberg |first = Lee |title = ''Big Trouble in Little China'' |work = [[Starlog]] |publisher = |date = May 1986}}</ref> Richter realized that \"what it needed wasn't a rewrite but a complete overhaul. It was a dreadful screenplay. This happens often when scripts are bought and there's no intention that the original writers will stay on\".<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/> Richter used ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' as his template, presenting \"the foreground story in a familiar context \u2013 rather than San Francisco at the turn-of-the-century, which distances the audience immediately \u2013 and just have one simple remove, the world underground, you have a much better chance of making direct contact with the audience\".<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/> He wrote his own draft in 10 weeks.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum2\"/> Goldman contacted Richter and suggested that he should not work on the project. Richter told him, \"I'm sorry the studio doesn't want to go forward with you guys, but my turning it down is not going to get you the job. They'll just hire someone else\".<ref name=\"Teitelbaum2\"/>\n\nFox wanted to deny Goldman and Weinstein writing credit, and eliminated their names from press releases.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum3\"/> They wanted only Richter to have credit.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum4\">Teitelbaum (July 1986), p. 58.</ref> In March 1986, the [[Writers Guild of America, West]] determined that \"written by\" credit would go to Goldman and Weinstein, based on the [[WGA screenwriting credit system]] which protects original writers.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum3\"/><ref name=\"Swires, Steve\">{{cite news |last = Swires |first = Steve |title = John Carpenter: Kung Fu, Hollywood Style |work = [[Starlog]] |pages = |language = |publisher = |date = August 1986}}</ref> However, Richter did get an \"adaptation by\" credit for his work on the script. Director John Carpenter was disappointed that Richter did not get a proper screenwriting credit because of the ruling. Carpenter made his own additions to Richter's rewrites, which included strengthening the Gracie Law role and linking her to Chinatown, removing a few action sequences due to budgetary restrictions and eliminating material deemed offensive to Chinese Americans. The characters in the film reminded Carpenter \"of the characters in ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' or ''[[His Girl Friday]]''. These are very 1930s, [[Howard Hawks]] people.\"<ref name=\"Goldberg2\"/> The rapid-fire delivery of dialogue, especially between Jack Burton and Gracie Law, is an example of what the director is referring to.<ref name=\"Goldberg2\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nBarish and Monash first offered the project to Carpenter in July 1985. He had read the Goldman/Weinstein script and deemed it \"outrageously unreadable though it had many interesting elements\".<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/> To compete with rival production ''[[The Golden Child]]''\u2019s casting of box office draw [[Eddie Murphy]], Carpenter wanted a big star of his own and both [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Jack Nicholson]] were considered but were busy.<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/>\n\nThe studio felt Kurt Russell was an up-and-coming star. Russell was initially not interested because he felt there were \"a number of different ways to approach Jack, but I didn't know if there was a way that would be interesting enough for this movie\".<ref name=\"Goldberg3\">{{cite news| last = Goldberg| first = Lee| title = Kurt Russell: Two-Fisted Hero| work = [[Starlog]]| language =| publisher =| date = July 1986| accessdate = }}</ref> After talking to Carpenter and reading the script a couple  of more times, he gained insight into the character and liked the notion of playing \"a hero who has so many faults. Jack is and isn't the hero. He falls on his ass as much as he comes through. This guy is a real blowhard. He's a lot of hot air, very self-assured, a screw-up\".<ref name=\"Goldberg3\"/> Furthermore, the actor felt that \"at heart he thinks he's [[Indiana Jones]] but the circumstances are always too much for him\".<ref name=\"Scott, Vernon\">{{cite news| last = Scott| first = Vernon| title = Kurt as Klutz| work = United Press International| pages =| publisher =| date = July 9, 1986}}</ref> Russell felt that the film would be a hard one to market. \"This is a difficult picture to sell because it's hard to explain. It's a mixture of the real history of Chinatown in San Francisco blended with Chinese legend and lore. It's bizarre stuff. There are only a handful of non-Asian actors in the cast\".<ref name=\"Scott, Vernon\"/>\n\nJohn Carpenter had seen Dennis Dun in ''[[Year of the Dragon (film)|Year of the Dragon]]'' and liked his work in that film. He met the actor twice before casting him in the role of Wang Chi only a few days before principal photography.<ref name=\"Dickholtz, Daniel\">{{cite news |last = Dickholtz |first = Daniel |title = Dennis Dun, Kung Fu Hero |work = [[Starlog]] |publisher = |date = September 1986}}</ref> The martial arts sequences were not hard for Dun who had \"dabbled\" in training as a kid and done Chinese opera as an adult.<ref name=\"Dickholtz, Daniel\"/> He was drawn to the portrayal of Asian characters in the movie as he said, \"I\u2019m seeing Chinese actors getting to do stuff that American movies usually don\u2019t let them do. I\u2019ve never seen this type of role for an Asian in an American film\".<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/> [[Jackie Chan]] was at one point considered for the role of Wang Chi but decided after the box office disasters of ''[[The Big Brawl]]'' and ''[[The Protector (1985 film)|The Protector]]'' he should put more time and effort into his career in [[Hong Kong]]'s film industry with ''[[Police Story (1985 film)|Police Story]]'' instead.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe studio pressured Carpenter to cast a rock star in the role of Gracie Law, Jack Burton's love interest, but Carpenter wanted Kim Cattrall. The studio was not keen on the idea because at the time Cattrall was primarily known for raunchy comedies like ''[[Porky's]]'' and ''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]''. She was drawn to the film because of the way her character was portrayed. \"I'm not screaming for help the whole time.

I\u2019m the brains and he's the brawn\".<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/>\n\n===Principal photography===\nKurt Russell lifted weights and began running two months before production began to prepare for the physical demands of principal photography. In addition, Carpenter and his cast and crew did a week's rehearsals that mainly involved choreographing the martial arts scenes.<ref name=\"Steranko\">{{cite news |last = Steranko |first = Jim |title = The Trouble with Kurt |work = Prevue |pages = 73 | publisher = | date = August 1986}}</ref> 20th Century Fox was afraid that the production would create major overruns and hired Carpenter to direct because he could work fast. He was given only 10 weeks of pre-production.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum3\"/>\n\nProblems began to arise when Carpenter learned that the next Eddie Murphy vehicle, ''The Golden Child'', featured a similar theme and was going to be released around the same time as ''Big Trouble in Little China''. (As it happened, Carpenter was asked by [[Paramount Pictures]] to direct ''The Golden Child''). He remarked in an interview, \"How many adventure pictures dealing with Chinese mysticism have been released by the major studios in the past 20 years? For two of them to come along at the exact same time is more than mere coincidence.\"<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/> To beat the rival production at being released in theaters, ''Big Trouble'' went into production in October 1985 so it could open in July 1986, five months before ''The Golden Child''{{'}}s Christmas release.\n\nAlthough the early exterior establishing scenes were filmed on location in Chinatown,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nortonsmoviemaps.com/blog/big-trouble-in-little-china |title=Big Trouble in Little China |author=Larson, Erika |date=February 5, 2015 |website=Norton's Movie Maps [blog] |accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref> most of the film was shot on sets built in the [[20th Century Studios|Fox lot]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://ew.com/comic-con/2016/07/16/big-trouble-little-china-oral-history/ |title=Big Trouble in Little China oral history |author=Collis, Clark |date=July 16, 2016 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=21 January 2020}}</ref> Production designer John Lloyd designed the elaborate underground sets and recreated Chinatown with three-story buildings, roads, streetlights, sewers and so on. This was necessary for the staging of complicated special effects and kung fu fight sequences that would have been very hard to do on location.<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/> This forced the filmmaker to shoot the film in 15 weeks with a $25 million budget. For the film's many fight scenes Carpenter worked with martial arts choreographer [[James Lew]], who planned out every move in advance. Says Carpenter, \"I used every cheap gag \u2013 trampolines, wires, reverse movements and upside down sets. It was much like photographing a dance.\"<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/>\n\nCarpenter envisioned the film as an inverse of traditional scenarios in action films with a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] protagonist helped by a minority sidekick. In ''Big Trouble in Little China'', Jack Burton, despite his bravado, is constantly portrayed as rather bumbling; in one fight sequence, he knocks himself unconscious before the fight begins. Wang Chi, on the other hand, is constantly portrayed as highly skilled and competent. On a [[audio commentary|commentary track]] for the DVD release, Carpenter said the film is really about a sidekick (Burton) who thinks he is a leading man. According to Carpenter, the studio \"didn't get it\"<ref name=\"Nichols\">{{cite news |last = Nichols |first = Peter M |title = ''Big Trouble'': Big Comeback |work = [[The New York Times]] |publisher = |date = May 25, 2001 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/25/movies/home-video-big-trouble-big-comeback.html?sq=%22Big+Trouble+in+Little+China%22&scp=1&st=nyt |accessdate = 2008-12-02}}</ref> and made him write something that would explain the character of Jack Burton.

[[Richard Edlund]], head of Boss Film Studios, said that there were no difficulties with the company's workload and that ''Big Trouble'' was probably its favorite film at the time, with the exception of ''[[Ghostbusters]]''.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum4\"/> The effects budget for the film was just under $2 million, which Edlund said was barely adequate. One of the more difficult effects was the floating eyeball, a spy for Lo-Pan. It was powered by several puppeteers and dozens of cables to control its facial expressions. It was shot with a special matting system specially designed for it.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum4\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Big Trouble in Little China (soundtrack)}}\nJohn Carpenter received a Saturn Award Best Music nomination for this film.<ref>{{IMDb title|90728|section=awards}}</ref> With the soundtrack, Carpenter wanted to avoid the usual clich\u00e9s as he found that \"other scores for American movies about Chinese characters are basically rinky tink, chop suey music.

{"title_page": "List of View Askewniverse characters", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|list|date=March 2009}}\n{{Lead too short|date=January 2015}}\n{{Long plot|date=January 2015}}\n}}\n\nThis is a list of major and recurring characters in [[Kevin Smith]]'s fictional universe known as the [[View Askewniverse]].\n\n==''Clerks'' (1994)==\n\n===Dante Hicks===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Dante Hicks\n| first              = ''[[Clerks]]'' (1994)\n| last               = ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]]'' (2019)\n| creator            = [[Kevin Smith]]\n| portrayer          = [[Brian O'Halloran]]\n| occupation         = Quick Stop store clerk/owner<br/>Mooby's restaurant clerk (''Clerks II'')\n| spouse             = Becky Hicks n\u00e9e Scott (''Clerks II'')\n| gender             = Male\n| family             = Donald Hicks (father)<br>Mrs. Hicks (mother)\n| children           = Unnamed child\n| relatives          = Grant Hicks (cousin)<br>Jim Hicks (cousin)<br>Gil Hicks (cousin)<br>Mr. Scott (father-in-law)<br>Mrs. Scott (mother-in-law) \n| significant_other  = Caitlin Bree (ex-girlfriend)<br>Julie Dwyer (ex-girlfriend; deceased)<br>Veronica Loughran (ex-girlfriend)<br>Emma Bunting (ex-fiancee) \n}}\nDante Hicks, played by [[Brian O'Halloran]], is 22 (33 in ''[[Clerks II]]''), works at the Quick Stop Market in [[Leonardo, New Jersey]], and still lives with his parents. He feels that because he runs the store, he is responsible and successful in life, and yet, he is a push-over who often agrees to work when he doesn't have to (hence his catch phrase, \"I'm not even supposed to be here today!\"). He frequently gets into debates ranging from [[philosophy]] to ''[[Star Wars]]'' with his best friend, fellow clerk Randal Graves, who works at the adjacent RST Video Store.\n\nDante is laid-back, personable, articulate, and logical (especially when compared with his best friend Randal), and is easily angered by Randal's actions or behavior, particularly when Randal's actions lead to negative consequences. For example, Dante often scolds Randal for disrespecting customers, while Randal often tries to defend his actions.\n\nThe film centers on the [[Surrealism|surreal]] events of a day at the Quick Stop that Dante must deal with. Among other problems, Dante becomes the target of an anti-smoking mob who pelt him with [[cigarette]]s, and he is issued a [[summons]] and fined for selling cigarettes to a four-year-old, a crime Randal had in fact accidentally committed. In addition, he is continually [[Stalking|stalked]] by [[Jay and Silent Bob]] ([[Jason Mewes]] and [[Kevin Smith]]), two drug dealers who loiter in front of the store all day and often like to go inside and steal. A running gag throughout the film is the scent of [[shoe polish]] on him, as he uses some to write a makeshift open sign to hang over the stuck window shutters of the store.\n\nThe film also deals with Dante's stressful romantic relationships. He has difficulty dealing with his girlfriend Veronica, especially her extensive history of performing [[fellatio]] (on 37 different men, including him) \u2014 even though she seems to genuinely love him, going so far as to bring him [[lasagna]] at work and help him fix a tire. At the same time, Dante is besotted with ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree and seems intent on rekindling that relationship. In the end, Dante ends up with neither woman; Randal ends the relationship by telling Veronica that Dante never got over Caitlin, and Caitlin is hospitalized after accidentally having sex in a dark bathroom with a [[Cadaver|corpse]], whom she had believed to be Dante.\n\nAfter an argument with Veronica, Dante gets into a physical altercation with Randal, and he rants about his anxieties including the loss of his girlfriend and Caitlin, as well as his overall miserable life. He is left speechless when Randal explodes at him, accusing him of blaming everyone else and not taking responsibility for his lack of initiative. The two reconcile and clean up the Quick Stop. In the final scene, he tells Randal that he is going to try and work things out with Veronica. It is implied that he will try to find direction in his life.\n\nIn the film's original ending, after Randal leaves the Quick Stop to go home, a customer comes in, with Dante telling him that the store is closed. The customer responds by pulling out a gun and killing Dante before taking the money from the cash register and leaving. The scene is meant to reference Dante & Randall's earlier discussion; that \"'Empire' was a better film, because it ended on such a down-note\". Kevin Smith's mentors criticized this ending; under the advice of one of the mentors, [[John Pierson (filmmaker)|John Pierson]], Smith edited out that ending. Therefore, the theatrical version ends when Randal leaves.\n\nIn ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', Dante, like Randal, has a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] early in the film in which the two clerks have Jay and Silent Bob arrested for loitering in front of Quick-Stop as well as for selling drugs in front of the store. As a result, a [[restraining order]] was placed on Jay and Silent Bob, who were not allowed within a hundred feet of the store. He and Randal attend the ''Bluntman and Chronic'' movie premiere, where Dante expresses chagrin that [[Judi Dench]] played him in the movie.\n\nIn ''Clerks II'', Dante and Randal are forced to work at a Mooby's fast food restaurant after Randal accidentally leaves a coffee pot on in the Quick Stop, causing the store to burn down. It is revealed that Dante is engaged and is planning to move to [[Florida]] with his fianc\u00e9e Emma. This leaves Randal feeling [[Depression (mood)|depressed]], but does not express his upset at Dante over the decision until near the end of the movie. Randal also expresses his fears of losing Dante; under the persuasion of Randal, Dante decides to stay in [[New Jersey]]. With the two having been fired for Dante's very unconventional bachelor party at Mooby's, the two purchase the Quick Stop and the RST Video, which they restore and co-manage. He also calls off his engagement with Emma in favor of his boss, Becky.\n\nDante briefly appears twice in ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]]''. The first is at the film's opening where he arrives at the Quick Stop to open the store and is quickly pulled aside by police officers. Not knowing what's going on, Dante assumes they are looking for Randal and offers to reveal his location. The second is at the film's end where he complains about the steel shutters being once again jammed with chewed gum, not even noticing Jay, Silent Bob and Jay's daughter Milly. Jay then revealed to Milly that he and Silent Bob had been pranking Dante by purposely putting in chewed gum in the locks for the past twenty-five years.\n\n===Randal Graves===\n{{for|the 19th century New York politician|Randall Graves}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Randal Graves\n| first              = ''[[Clerks]]'' (1994)\n| last               = ''Clerks II'' (2006)\n| creator            = Kevin Smith\n| portrayer          = [[Jeff Anderson]]\n| occupation         = RST Video store clerk/owner<br/>Mooby's restaurant clerk (''Clerks II'')\n| gender             = Male\n| family             = Mrs. Graves (mother) \n| relatives          = Unnamed grandmother<br>Brodie Bruce (cousin)<br>Walter (cousin)\n}}\nRandal Graves, played by [[Jeff Anderson]], is a clerk at RST Video, located next door to the Quick Stop convenience store in [[Leonardo, New Jersey]]. Chris Smith in ''[[The New York Times]]'' described this character as a \"smart-ass\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Register Dogs|author=Chris Smith|publisher=New York Magazine|date=24 Oct 1994}}</ref> while multiple reviewers have described him as a \"super slacker\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The News that Should Have Been|publisher=Game Axis Unwired}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/719/719933p1.html|title = Clerks II Movie Review | publisher =IGN}}</ref> In the first film and the cartoon, Randal is a prime example of the typical [[slacker]]: He works in a dead-end job, has a hatred for customers, and arrives at work late every day. He periodically closes the store (during work hours) to chat with his best friend Dante Hicks, a Quick Stop clerk. Whereas Dante believes that title dictates responsbility, Randal does whatever he pleases.\n\nRandal is usually quite aggressive and offensive (mainly to customers) and doesn't really seem to care much about what others think about him. He regularly arrives at the video store at least 15\u201330 minutes late and charges late fees to customers who have been waiting for the store to open. Often, he ignores customers' requests to recommend a movie, explaining that he does not meddle with other people's affairs (except perhaps those of Dante). He has been known to order [[pornography|porn]] movies for the store in front of children, spit water in customers' faces, and intrude on private conversations about [[Sexual intercourse|sex]].\n\nOne of Randal's ancestors, who was [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], immigrated to [[New Jersey]] in the 17th century. Randal is related to Brodie Bruce of ''Mallrats''. The two share a mutual \"Cousin Walter\", who is known for performing bizarre sexual acts, such as [[Masturbation|masturbating]] on a crashing aircraft and eventually killing himself while attempting to perform auto-fellatio. Both Brodie and Randal also mention stories regarding their grandmother. Brodie once mentioned she became a lesbian on her sixtieth birthday, while Randal mentioned that she used racial slurs in front of him as a child. The latter scenario influenced Randal into using the term \"[[List of ethnic slurs#P|porch monkey]]\" in front of an [[African American]] couple while working at Mooby's. However, Randal did not know at that point that he used a racial slur and claimed he used the term \"porch monkey\" to refer to lazy people of all racial backgrounds in general.\n\nRandal's behavior at times appears contradictory; for example, he says that he hates people but loves social gatherings, and says \"This job would be great if it weren't for the fucking customers\". Such behavior spills into his relationship with Dante, whom he often coerces into highly unlikely, theoretical situations by manipulating him into feeling guilty. Randal goes off on an analytical theory of something outlandish, before going to the complete opposite. He might also perhaps be the worst friend of all time, frequently causing problems in Dante's personal life by spilling secrets to those he shouldn't.\n\nDespite his toxic personality, Randal truly cares for his best friend Dante. He even once said to Dante's ex-girlfriend Caitlin \"Hey Caitlin. Break his heart again, and I'll kill ya. Nothing personal.\" to which Caitlin remarks he has always been very protective of Dante. Randal sees Dante as the \"counterbalance\" to the former's dislike of other people. Randal only goes to Quick Stop instead of staying in the video store to talk to Dante about whatever comes to mind. Randal does his best to offer whatever advice he can to Dante though Dante generally doesn't take it because of Randal's rather rough way of putting it. Randal has also attempted to do favors for Dante, although they often backfire. For example, in ''Clerks 2'', Randal set up a [[donkey show]] as a going-away gift for Dante, who was to move to [[Florida]] with his then-fianc\u00e9e, Emma. However, the show results in Dante and Randal getting arrested (alongside co-worker Elias, and Jay & Silent Bob), leading to a near-breakdown in their friendship. Another example was in ''Clerks'' in which after Randal told Veronica that Dante left her for his ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree. However, not only was Randal unaware that Dante reconsidered his decision to leave Veronica for Caitlin, a fight occurs between Randal and Dante after Veronica told him what Randal told her.\n\nIn ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', Randal, like Dante, has a cameo early in the film in which the two clerks have Jay and Silent Bob arrested for loitering in front of Quick-Stop as well as for selling drugs in front of the store. As a result, a restraining order was placed on Jay and Silent Bob, who were not allowed within a hundred feet of the store. He and Dante attend the ''Bluntman and Chronic'' movie premiere, where Randal mentions putting up another restraining order on Jay and Silent Bob because he is going to give the movie a scathing review on the Internet.\n\nRandal's life centers on movies, [[video game]]s and pornography. He often quotes dialogue and discusses films, goes to other video stores to rent porn, and is often depicted in ''Clerks: The Animated Series'' with a porn magazine. His love life is nonexistent (at least in a romantic sense). The few relationships he had never lasted; his ex-girlfriends were subsequently so fed up with men that they became [[lesbian]]s. In contrast, it is implied he has a budding sex life, despite his overall aimless existence; he frequently has girls over to his house, and brings them over to the Quick Stop when his mother is home. In ''Clerks II'', it is stated that many of his sexual exploits are with \"barely legal pussy\" (18-year-old girls), thanks in no small part to their willingness to take part in taboo sexual acts (such as what he and others refer to bluntly as ass-to-mouth). As evidenced in a scene in ''Clerks II'', Randal's favorite band is [[King Diamond]] and he is a fan of 80s [[speed metal]] and [[black metal]], and dislikes other music, such as the band [[The Time (band)|The Time]]. He is a fan of the novel ''[[Catcher in the Rye]]'' because it \"recognizes the sheer volume of phonies in the world\" [http://www.myspace.com/randalgravesnj]. Randal is also a fan of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy and ''[[Ranger Danger]]'', and staunchly hates the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[Transformers]]''.\n\nRandal is also frequently the cause of the problems that he and Dante get into much to Dante's constant annoyance. The animated series shows this at least once per episode and it is mentioned in ''Clerks II'' that Randal is responsible for several of Dante's ruined relationships. This trait reaches its apex in the third episode of the Animated Series where he almost gets [[Leonardo Leonardo]] destroyed by the [[U.S. Air Force]] after he mistakes the villain's [[food poisoning]] for [[Outbreak (film)|deadly motaba virus]]. It's also revealed here that he got his and Dante's jobs throughout the films and show because when Dante is teasing Randal for always being wrong. Randal retorts, \"What about that time I told you about those two open jobs down the street? You know we'd stay there for a while, earn some money then move on with our lives.\" He then realizes that they've spent practically a decade at their jobs and yells \"Oh my God, you're right, I'm always wrong!\". Randal is based on Smith's long-time friend [[Bryan Johnson (filmmaker)|Bryan Johnson]].<ref name=\"hitfix\">{{cite web|title=Director's career comes full circle with new AMC reality show about his comic shop|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/interview-kevin-smith-talks-comic-book-men|work=hitix.com|author=Alan Sepinwall|date=12 Feb 2012|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nRandal does not appear in ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]]'', but is mentioned by Dante at the beginning of the film when Dante offers to tell the police where Randal is, implying that Randal has, for undisclosed reasons, gone into hiding since the events of ''Clerks II''.\n\n===Veronica Loughran===\nVeronica Loughran, played by [[Marilyn Ghigliotti]], is Dante's girlfriend in the beginning of ''Clerks''. She is currently attending college and frequently makes attempts to encourage Dante to quit his dead-end job at the Quick Stop. Tensions arise between the two during a conversation about sexual relations, when Dante admits to having sex with 12 different women (including Veronica) and Veronica reveals that she performed oral sex on 37 men, including Dante. Later, as an apology, Veronica returns to the Quick Stop with some lasagna for Dante. The relationship ends badly when Randal tells Veronica at the video store that Dante is dumping her to get back with Caitlin, despite the fact that Dante reconsidered this decision; as a result, Veronica storms in at the Quick Stop and attacks Dante before leaving.\n\nVeronica does not appear in the sequel, but she is mentioned in a deleted scene, where Randall calls out Dante for going to [[Brookdale Community College]] just to appease Veronica. This implies they made up after the argument in the first film but subsequently broke up.\n\n===Jay and Silent Bob===\n{{Main|Jay and Silent Bob}}\n\n===Willam Black===\nWillam Black was played by longtime View Askew film editor and producer [[Scott Mosier]] in ''Clerks'', ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'' and ''Clerks II''. He was played by Ethan Suplee in ''Mallrats''. Willam is referred to as an \"idiot man-child\" by other characters in the View Askewniverse, mostly because of his limited intelligence and demeanor (glazed eyes, unkempt hair and beard, and lack of coordination). He has an oddly profane sexual taste, which includes [[Snowballing (sexual practice)|snowballing]], thus giving him his other nickname, \"Snowball\". He is often seen staring at ceilings and saying \"That's beautiful, man!\"\n\n===Caitlin Bree===\nCaitlin Bree first appeared in ''Clerks''. She was portrayed by [[Lisa Spoonauer]]. She was one of Dante's old girlfriends. Both of them express a desire to restart their relationship. At the end of the film, however, she has sex with a corpse at the Quick Stop bathroom, believing it to be Dante. She is sent a mental institution to deal with her trauma afterward.\n\nIt was revealed in ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' that Caitlin and [[Alyssa Jones]] had a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] relationship that included [[fisting]].\n\nIn the comic book ''[[Clerks. (comics)|Clerks: The Holiday Special]]'', Dante visits Caitlin at the [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] located in [[Marlboro Township, New Jersey|Marlboro]]. Caitlin has not spoken a word since the incident, prompting Randal to suggest that Dante [[fornicate]] with Caitlin using a [[candy cane]]. Caitlin awakens from her state, but is furious and does not want to see him again.\n\nCaitlin was also mentioned in ''[[Clerks: The Lost Scene]]'' and ''Clerks II''.\n\nIn Kevin Smith's never-produced script ''Superman Lives'', the governor is named Caitlin Bree. It is assumed, but not confirmed, to be the same Bree from \"Clerks\".\n\nSmith named the character after his favorite ''[[Degrassi (franchise)|Degrassi]]'' character, [[Caitlin Ryan (Degrassi)|Caitlin Ryan]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pYG5eRoSTJwC&pg=PA46&dq=%22caitlin+ryan%22+degrassi&cd=3#v=onepage&q=%22caitlin%20ryan%22%20degrassi&f=false |title=SPIN \u2013 Google Books |accessdate=2010-05-23|date=August 2005 }}</ref>\n\n===Julie Dwyer===\nJulie Dwyer was first mentioned in ''Clerks'' as an old high school friend of Dante Hicks and Randal Graves who died at a [[swimming pool]] at a [[YMCA]]. Her funeral scene was eventually shown (in animated form), in ''[[Clerks: The Lost Scene]]'', which appeared on the ''Clerks X'' DVD set. In ''Mallrats'' (which takes place the day before ''Clerks.''), Dwyer is told that the camera adds 10 pounds, so she over-exercises before her appearance on the game show ''Truth or Date'', which leads to her death. She is mentioned in ''Chasing Amy'' as a friend of Alyssa Jones. She is referred to again in ''Clerks II'', where Randal mentions going to her funeral and his claim that Dante said he needs to \"shit or get off the pot\" (which Dante claims was actually said by Randal).\n\n===Rick Derris===\nFirst appearing in ''[[Clerks]]'', Rick Derris was played by [[Ernest O'Donnell]],  (a childhood friend of Kevin Smith). Rick is a sexual deviant in the Askewniverse. In ''Clerks'', while bragging about being more physically fit than Dante Hicks, he reveals to Dante that he had sex with his ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree during their five-year relationship.\n\nIn ''[[Mallrats]]'', Gwen Turner, T.S. Quint, and Brodie Bruce recall an incident at a costume party in which Derris and Turner had sex on a pool table. While Turner thinks it was a trivial event, Bruce and Quint remember the event very well because Derris and Turner were having sex on a pool table while dressed as [[Jackie Gleason]] and [[Burt Reynolds]], respectively, from ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]''. In ''[[Chasing Amy]]'', Derris and his friend Cohee London engaged in a three-way with Tricia Jones's older sister [[Alyssa Jones]] during high school, which gave her the nickname \"Finger Cuffs\". When Alyssa is confronted by Holden McNeil about this occurrence during ''Chasing Amy'', Ernest O'Donnell makes a cameo sitting next to them and listening in. He was planned to be Jay's older brother, but as the movie in which this point would be addressed was never produced, Kevin Smith has stated that this is no longer the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/9588|title=The Kevin Smith Sessions Part II of IV| publisher =Ain't It Cool}}</ref>\n\n===Old Man===\nAn unnamed elderly man, played by Al Berkowitz, approaches Dante and asks to use the restroom, which is normally for employees only. He disappears into the restroom after harassing Dante for a softer roll of toilet paper and a porno magazine to read. It is later on revealed that he dies of a heart attack while masturbating over the magazine; his body maintains an erection as a result of [[rigor mortis]]. Dante does not take notice of this due to him closing the store to play hockey on the roof and attend Julie Dwyer's wake. In addition, the restroom light shuts off automatically at 5:14&nbsp;p.m. for reasons unknown. As a result, Caitlin Bree winds up having sex with the elderly man's corpse, mistaking it for Dante.\n\n===Chewlies Representative===\nA customer, played by Scott Schiaffo, pays for a cup of coffee and asks Dante if he can drink it beside the register counter. He then confronts a younger customer who is about to buy a pack of cigarettes, pulling out a cancer-ridden lung out of his handbag and showing him several effects of smoking before persuading him to buy a pack of Chewlies gum instead. Later on, he instigates a small demonstration in the store by calling Dante a \"merchant of death\" and encouraging customers to throw cigarettes at him. The revolt is stopped by Veronica, who sprays everyone with a fire extinguisher before stopping the customer from exiting. After discovering that he is a Chewlies representative, she tells him to leave before telling the other customers to go back to their jobs.\n\n===Olaf the Russian Metalhead===\nOlaf, played by John Henry Westhead, is introduced by Jay as Silent Bob's [[Russia]]n cousin. He is from [[Moscow]] and speaks very little English, but according to Jay, he runs a heavy metal band back in Russia and is looking to do a gig in [[New York City]]. A running gag throughout the film is Olaf's song \"Berserker\". A shirt for Olaf's band is worn by Jay throughout ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]''.\n\n==''Mallrats'' (1995)==\n\n===Brodie Bruce===\n{{Infobox character \n| colour             =#DEDEE2 \n| name               = Brodie Bruce \n| first              = ''[[Mallrats]]'' (1995) \n| last               = ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]]'' (2019) \n| creator            = [[Kevin Smith]] \n| portrayer          = [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]\n| occupation         = Owner of ''Brodie's Secret Stash''<br>Host of ''The Tonight Show''\n| gender             = Male \n| family             = Mr. Bruce (father)<br>Mrs. Bruce (mother)<br>Unnamed daughter\n| relatives          = Randal Graves (cousin)<br>Walter (cousin)\n| significant_other  = Rene Mosier (wife) \n}}\nBrodie Bruce ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]) is an unemployed, lazy, comic book-obsessed, [[Sega]]-playing [[slacker]], living with his parents and lacking the initiative and prospects appropriate to his age. Kevin Smith has said [[Walt Flanagan]] was the inspiration for the character.<ref name=\"hitfix\" /> Brodie is named after the main character in ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (a favorite film of Smith's, and one the director frequently references in his work), while his surname, Bruce, was the nickname given to the animatronic shark in ''Jaws''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nHis girlfriend, Rene Mosier, to whom Brodie's mother has never been introduced (out of fear on the part of Brodie), breaks up with him at the beginning of ''Mallrats'' and gives him a letter listing the reasons for doing so. At the end of the film they are back together, and it is mentioned that he went on to host ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', with Rene as his band leader and having gained the approval from his mother. He makes a brief appearance in ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'' and ''Jay and Silent Bob Reboot'' in which he shown to own his own comic book store called \"[[Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash|Brodie's Secret Stash]]\"; during the ending mid-credits scenes of the latter film, he is revealed to have married Rene, with whom he has a daughter, continuing to host ''The Tonight Show'' at night and run his comic book store during the day.\n\n===Rene Mosier===\nRene Mosier ([[Shannen Doherty]]) is Brodie's girlfriend. She broke up with him prior to the events of the film and began dating Shannon Hamilton, a clothing store manager at the mall. Brodie confronts her about the relationship, an encounter that leads to the two having sex in an elevator. Shannon later assaults Brodie and claims that he and Rene will have sex in a \"[[Anal sex|very uncomfortable place]]\" (interpreted to be the back of a [[Volkswagen]]). However, this apparently never happens as Shannon is later arrested after ''Truth or Date'' for statutory rape, and Brodie and Rene reconcile. Later, when Brodie becomes the host of ''The Tonight Show'', Rene serves as his bandleader.\n\nRene's last name is a reference to frequent Kevin Smith collaborator and close friend [[Scott Mosier]]. As a nod to her actor, who was well known for her role as [[Brenda Walsh (character)|Brenda Walsh]] on ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', she is mistakenly referred to as \"Brenda\" by Willam at one point.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MkfLxUKLd0YC&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q&f=false |title = An Askew View: The Films of Kevin Smith|isbn = 9781557835864|last1 = Muir|first1 = John Kenneth|year = 2002}}</ref>\n\n===Shannon Hamilton===\nShannon Hamilton is a character from ''[[Mallrats]]'' played by [[Ben Affleck]].\n\nIn the film, Shannon is the manager of the Fashionable Male clothing store. He is the arch enemy of Brodie Bruce ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]), a local mallrat and a major character in the film. It is revealed that Shannon is dating Bruce's ex-girlfriend Rene Mosier ([[Shannen Doherty]]), who dumped Bruce that morning and also has \"no respect for people with no shopping agenda\". Shannon later abducts Bruce and beats him severely, saying that he likes comforting girls on the rebound of unsuccessful relationships so that he can \"[[anal sex|fuck them in an uncomfortable place]]\", which Bruce asks if it's the back of a [[Volkswagen]]. This becomes a running joke in the film. Also, Tricia Jones (Renee Humphrey) reveals that she had sex with Hamilton as research for her book ''Borgasm: A Study of the 90s Male Sexual Prowess''. She even taped their sexual encounter. During the ''Truth or Date'' game show, Bruce announces his love for Rene, which angers Hamilton. Just before he can assault Bruce, [[Jay and Silent Bob|Silent Bob]] starts the video tape of Hamilton and Tricia Jones' sexual encounter that is played on the ''Truth or Date'' big screens. When Bruce tells the police that Jones is 15 years old, Hamilton is arrested for [[statutory rape]] (while protesting \"I thought she was 36!\"). During the conclusion, it is said that \"Shannon made a lot of friends at the Rahway State Correctional Facility\" and see a hand wrap around Hamilton's, with \"Love\" tattooed on his fingers.\n\nShannon is mentioned in ''Chasing Amy'', when Alyssa Jones says she had sex with him in college, only to have a tape of their sexual encounter be broadcast all over campus, thus retroactively making his comeuppance in Mallrats a case of poetic justice. In ''[[Clerks. (comics)|Clerks: The Comic Book]]'', Shannon's face is seen on a milk carton which says he is missing.\n\nWhen Kevin Smith was talking about making a sequel to ''Mallrats'' with the comic book ''Mallrats 2: [[Die Hard]] in a Mall'', he stated that Hamilton would be the main villain.\n\n===Tricia Jones===\nTricia Jones first appeared in the film ''Mallrats''. She was portrayed by [[Renee Humphrey]].\n\nTricia is the 15-year-old sister of Alyssa Jones and the author of ''Boregasm'', a look into the [[libido|sex drive]] of men between the ages of 14 and 30, which was later made into a movie.\n\nWhile writing the book, she kept a journal of all the men with whom she had sex, and video taped every experience. The archived videos were used to help Brodie Bruce win back his ex-girlfriend, Rene, from his nemesis Shannon Hamilton.\n\nUpon Brodie's urgent request, she gave Jay the tape of her sexual encounter with Shannon. Silent Bob was able to hack into the video output and play the tape during the live taping of ''Truth or Date''. Shannon was thereafter arrested for [[statutory rape]].\n\nIn the comic series ''[[Chasing Dogma]]'', Jay and Silent Bob are seen living with Tricia, only to be kicked out after months of loafing around (and after Jay spied on her in the shower). It is revealed that she had slept with Silent Bob (but not Jay, much to Jay's annoyance) as part of research for ''Boregasm''.\n\nTricia is briefly mentioned in ''Chasing Amy'', when her sister Alyssa Jones informed Holden McNeil via telephone that her \"sister is in town\", to which McNeil replies, \"the one who wrote the book?\" Tricia also makes a brief appearance in ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', where she discusses ''[[Bluntman and Chronic|The Bluntman and Chronic Movie]]'' with Alyssa.\n\n===Gwen Turner===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Gwen Turner\n| caption            = Gwen Turner in ''Mallrats''.\n| first              = ''Mallrats'' (1995)\n| last               = [[Clerks (comic)#Where's the Beef?|Where's the Beef?]] (2006)\n| creator            = Kevin Smith\n| portrayer          = [[Joey Lauren Adams]]\n| gender             = Female\n| significant_other  = T.S.

She was portrayed by [[Joey Lauren Adams]].\n\nTurner was the ex-girlfriend of T.S. Quint, one of the main characters played by [[Jeremy London]]. Despite cheating on him constantly, she still maintains a soft-spot for him.\n\nThroughout ''Mallrats'', Gwen is seen interacting with T.S. and Brodie. Her clothes shopping is often interrupted by Silent Bob crashing into her dressing room as she is changing. She also causes a major story point when she convinces Brandi Svenning ([[Claire Forlani]]) that T.S. was in fact a great boyfriend.\n\nGwen has been mentioned in other View Askew media. In ''Chasing Amy'', Alyssa Jones mentioned that she left her prom so that she could have sex with her 26-year-old date and Gwen in a limo her parents had rented (this is something of an in-joke, as both Turner and Jones were played by the same actress). Also, in the ''Clerks'' comic book [[Clerks. (comics)|Where's the Beef?]], Randal mentions that Dante Hicks tried to impress Gwen by wearing a [[Batman]] costume and standing on a roof top.\n\n===LaFours===\nLaFours is a fictional character from the film, Mallrats, who works as chief security guard at the local mall. He was portrayed by [[Sven-Ole Thorsen]].\n\nLaFours is considered (even by Jay and Silent Bob) as one of the most intimidating security guards on duty, due to his size and strength; in fact he's even got \"two kills\" on his record.\n\nWhilst attempting to get past LaFours in the destruction of the \"Truth or Date\" stage, Jay and Silent Bob mess up, resulting in both of them being pursued by him.\nWe later see the chief security guard attempting to evict T.S. and Brodie from the mall, only to get hit from behind by Jay with a [[baseball bat]]. LaFours and his team attempt to take both him and Silent Bob down, but lose track of him when they use a [[grappling hook]]. He is also seen having [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with Tricia Jones later in the film. In the [[epilogue]], he acquires a signed copy of Tricia's book (and perhaps even struck up a romance with her).\n\nWe also see LaFours on a large [[Bluntman and Chronic]] front cover, as seen at the comic book convention in Chasing Amy.\n\nLaFours is a historical/movie reference to Joe LeFors from ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''. Both characters wear white skimmers and both are portrayed as legendary law enforcers within their respective films.\n\n===T.S.

Quint (referred to as ''T.S.'' by friends) is one of the main characters in ''Mallrats''. He was portrayed by [[Jeremy London]].\n\nIn the film, T.S. is having trouble with his girlfriend Brandi Svenning ([[Claire Forlani]]) dealing with her authoritarian father ([[Michael Rooker]]). He tries to convince her to go to [[Florida]], where he planned to propose to her at [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] when [[Jaws (ride)|\"Jaws pops out of the water\"]]. This was ruined, however, when Brandi had to fill in for [[Julie Dwyer]] on her father's ''Truth or Date'' television pilot. T.S., showing his anger, causes Brandi to break up with him.\n\nFilled with grief, T.S. joins fellow newly dumped best friend Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) on a road trip to the local mall. Amongst many activities, the two realize that Mr. Svenning's ''Truth or Date'' is being filmed live at the mall that evening. After being kicked out by mall security under Svenning's orders, Brodie and T.S. get sage-like advise from a topless psychic in a dirt mall and return to stop the dating show. The duo successfully sabotage the show and T.S. finally proposes to Brandi, ending up with the two sharing a kiss.\n\nIn an epilogue to the film, it is revealed that T.S. and Brandi got married after they graduated at Universal Studios in Florida. They share their first husband-to-wife kiss just as [[Jaws (film)|Jaws]] pops out of the water.\n\nIn the original opening scene of ''Mallrats'', while at the 37th Annual Governor's Ball, T.S., dressed as a Revolutionary Soldier for a musical at the event, gets a musket tied up in Brandi's hair while on the roof of the high school where the event is being held. The governor's security believe it's an assassination attempt and the event turns into a shoot out. The governor is injured and ruins the chance of Svenning getting a check from her. Throughout this version, people in the mall recognize T.S. from television, to which he responds \"I got a musket tied up in my girlfriend's hair for God's sakes\". This line of the plot is referenced in the theatrical version of film when one of the television producers mentions the Governor's ball to Svenning.\n\n===Steve-Dave Pulasti and Walt Grover {{anchor|Steve-Dave Pulsati|Steve Pulsati|Dave Pulsati|Walt Grover|Steve-Dave}}===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE3\n| name               = Steve-Dave Pulasti and Walt Grover\n| first              = ''Mallrats'' (1995)\n| last               = ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'' (2001)\n| creator            = Kevin Smith\n| portrayer          = [[Bryan Johnson (filmmaker)|Bryan Johnson]]<br>[[Walt Flanagan]]\n| nickname           = Walt The Fanboy\n| alias              = Walt Flanagan\n| occupation         = Comic Books Store Owners\n| gender             = Male\n}}\nSteve-Dave Pulasti (usually referred to as Steve-Dave) and Walt \"the Fanboy\" Grover made their first appearance in ''Mallrats''. They are played by Smith's longtime friends [[Bryan Johnson (filmmaker)|Bryan Johnson]] and [[Walt Flanagan]], respectively. Walt has a signature catchphrase; whenever Steve-Dave argues with a character, his comments will be followed by Walt saying \"''Tell 'em Steve-Dave!''\"\n\nAccording to Johnson, the character of Steve-Dave is based on the owner of a comic book store that Smith, Johnson, and Flanagan once frequented; \"Walter could never remember if the guy's name was actually Steve or Dave. So the name Steve-Dave was coined.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|last1       = Muir\n|first1      = John Kenneth\n|year        = 2002\n|title       = An Askew View: The Films of Kevin Smith\n|url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=MkfLxUKLd0YC&pg=PA79\n|publisher   = [[Hal Leonard Corporation]]\n|page        = 79\n|access-date = 2018-06-15\n|isbn = 9781557835864\n}}</ref>\n\nSteve-Dave and Walt also appeared briefly in ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''; they had scenes in ''Chasing Amy'' and ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'' that were cut from the final edit.\n\nThe duo have also appeared in most of the comic books based on the Askewniverse. They also appeared in a Jay and Silent Bob [[MTV]] short.\n\nThe duo have been made into [[action figures]].\n\n===Jared Svenning===\nJared is the father of Brandi Svenning, T.S's girlfriend. He is portrayed by [[Michael Rooker]].\n\nJared is T.S's [[antagonist]] throughout the film, and Jared is seen being happy that Brandi and T.S. broke up. He is also in charge of the TV game show ''Truth or Date'' in which one of its shows was to take place at the local mall. After a confrontation with T.S. and during a new meeting with him, Brodie stinkpalms (In which Brodie inserted his own hand up his butt) Jared by shaking his hand and offering him chocolate pretzels (in which Jared holds every pretzel he eats with the hand that he shook Brodie's stink-palmed hand with). Jared unsuccessfully has Brodie and T.S. arrested, but they are rescued by Jay and Silent Bob. Jared becomes ill after getting stink-palmed, and his show is ruined.\n\n===Willam===\nWillam is a minor character in both ''[[Clerks]]'' (where he was portrayed by [[Scott Mosier]]) and ''Mallrats'' (portrayed by [[Ethan Suplee]]).<ref>http://www.avclub.com/article/ethan-suplee-deepwater-horizon-mallrats-and-not-kn-242980 Interview with Ethan Suplee</ref> Throughout the film he is seen trying to find a [[sailboat]] within an [[autostereogram]], constantly failing at it while other characters, including T.S., Brodie, Rene, some kids, and [[Stan Lee]], succeed. At the end of the film he finally snaps and wanders around the mall moaning about the sailboat, unknowingly hitting the stage at a crucial point when Silent Bob is trying to retrieve a video tape he dropped and causing it to go right back into Silent Bob's hands. During the credits it is revealed that Willam eventually found the sailboat, although Willam himself seems surprised. In subsequent comic books, Willam makes cameo roles, still lamenting about the sailboat.\n\n==''Chasing Amy'' (1997)==\n\n===Holden McNeil {{anchor|Holden}}===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE3\n| name               = Holden McNeil\n| first              = ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997)\n| last               = ''Jay and Silent Bob Reboot'' (2019)\n| creator            = Kevin Smith\n| portrayer          = [[Ben Affleck]]\n| occupation         = Comic Book Creator\n| gender             = Male\n| children           = Amy Jones (biological daughter) \n| significant_other  = Alyssa Jones (ex-girlfriend; also co-parent of his child) \n}}\nHolden McNeil is the main character in the film ''Chasing Amy''. The character is played by Ben Affleck. Throughout the film he is trying to develop a working relationship with Alyssa Jones, who is a [[lesbian]]. He is the co-creator of the fictitious comic book [[Bluntman and Chronic]]. Kevin Smith has stated that Holden is the View Askewniverse character most similar to himself.\n\nHolden also appears in ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', living in a small barnhouse and giving Jay and Silent Bob information about the [[internet]]. He was named after the lead character [[Holden Caulfield]] from ''[[Catcher in the Rye]]''.\n\n===Banky Edwards===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE3\n| name               = Banky Edwards\n| first              = ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997)\n| last               = ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' (2001)\n| creator            = Kevin Smith\n| portrayer          = Jason Lee\n| occupation         = Comic Book Creator/Inker\n| gender             = Male\n| significant_other  = Hooper LaMante (boyfriend) \n}}\nBanky Edwards is a major supporting character in ''Chasing Amy''. He was played by Jason Lee. Banky is Holden McNeil's lifelong best friend and co-created the smash hit ''Bluntman & Chronic'' with him. Banky is very protective of Holden and finds his infatuation with Alyssa Jones to be disgusting. He also exhibits many examples of ignorant [[Homophobia|homophobic]] behavior throughout the film, which eventually leads to him and Holden breaking off their friendship, ending the comic.\n\nBanky returned in ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back''. Having received exclusive movie rights for Bluntman and Chronic, Banky has allowed a film adaptation to go through production which sets Jay and Silent Bob on an adventure to stop this from taking place. Banky is on the set when Jay and Silent Bob arrive, attempting to make [[Hollywood]] connections. After arguing with the two stoners while a gun fight is taking place, Banky agrees to give the two of them part of his profits in exchange for the film going through. However, the film turns out to be a huge bomb which effectively ends Edwards' career.\n\nIn ''Chasing Amy'', Banky, an inker on ''Bluntman and Chronic'', is accused by a comic book fan ([[Scott Mosier]]) of being \"a tracer\", which leads to a fight. In a deleted scene from ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', the fan returns to call Banky a tracer once again, which results in another confrontation.\n\n===Hooper LaMante {{anchor|Hooper}}===\nHooper LaMante (a.k.a. Hooper X) is a character from ''Chasing Amy'' played by [[Dwight Ewell]]. A gay man himself, he tells Holden to accept Alyssa's sexuality and try not to worry about it.\n\nHooper is seen again at the end of ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', walking out of the premiere of the ''[[Bluntman and Chronic|Bluntman and Chronic: The Movie]]'' with Banky. While Banky is in shock of the fact that the movie will ruin him, Hooper says that the movie was like \"watching ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' all over again\". It's also implied that he has at least a sexual relationship with Banky; when Banky makes a remark about Hooper \"taking shaft as opposed to being Shaft\" Hooper replies \"I don't hear you complaining.\"\n\nIn an extended deleted scene, we hear Hooper continuing, \"Well, I don't hear you complaining nightly. In fact, all I hear from you is, 'Yes, Hooper. Cram the balls! Work the shaft! And...\" To which Banky responds \"Hey! Hey, HEY! What'd we say? Not in public.\" \n\n===Alyssa Jones===\n{{Infobox character \n| colour             = #DEDEE3 \n| name               = Alyssa Jones \n| first              = ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997) \n| last               = ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]]'' (2019)\n| creator            = [[Kevin Smith]]\n| portrayer          = [[Joey Lauren Adams]] \n| occupation         = Comic book artist \n| spouse             = Unnamed wife \n| gender             = Female \n| family             = Tricia Jones (sister)<br>Heather Jones (sister) \n| children           = Amy Jones (daughter) \n| significant_other  = Caitlin Bree (fling)<br>Two unnamed guys (hookups)<br>Shannon Hamilton (one night stand)<br>Gwen Turner (one night stand)<br>Unnamed man (one night stand)<br>Holden McNeil (ex-boyfriend; also co-parent of her child) \n}}\nAlyssa Jones is the main character in the film ''Chasing Amy''. She is played by Joey Lauren Adams. \n\nIn ''Chasing Amy'', she meets Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards at a comic book convention in New York where the two men are promoting their comic Bluntman and Chronic. Holden is attracted to her, but soon learns that she is attracted to women. The two begin hanging out and both of them develop a deep friendship, however, Holden is no longer able to contain his feelings and confesses his love to Alyssa. She at first is initially angry with him, but that night, the two begin a romantic relationship. Their new relationship worsens the tension between Holden and Banky, who dislikes and distrusts Alyssa and is bothered by her and Holden's relationship. Banky investigates and uncovers Alyssa's past and he tells Holden that Alyssa participated in a threesome with two guys in high school which gave her the nickname \"Finger Cuffs\". Holden is deeply disturbed by this revelation, having believed that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept with. Holden angrily confronts Alyssa while attending a hockey game. During a tearful argument, she admits to Holden about her \"many\" youthful sexual experimentations and apologizes for letting him believe that he was the only man she had been with, however, she refuses to apologize for her past actions, and Holden leaves feeling angry and confused. Inspired by Silent Bob's story, Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his fractured friendship with Banky. Holden invites both of them over to his place and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain as her boyfriend and also tells Banky that he realizes that Banky is in love with him; kissing him passionately to prove the point. Holden suggests that the three of them have a threesome. While Banky agrees to participate, however, Alyssa refuses, explaining to Holden that it will not save their relationship. Before leaving, Alyssa tells Holden that she loves him, but she will not be his whore. One year later, Alyssa is busy promoting her new comic at a convention in New York, where Banky (also promoting his comics in the same convention) gestures Holden to her booth and provides wordless encouragement to talk to her. They have a quiet, emotional conversation and Holden gives her a copy of his new comic \"Chasing Amy\", which is based on their relationship and tells her goodbye. After Holden leaves, Alyssa's new girlfriend arrives and asks who he was. A shaken, misty-eyed Alyssa replies, \"Oh, just some guy I knew\". \n{{Clear}}\n\n==''Dogma'' (1999)==\n\n===Bethany Sloane===\nBethany Sloane is played by actress [[Linda Fiorentino]]. Bethany was born in 1961 (which makes her 38 during the events in ''Dogma''), and was raised as a devout [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. When she was five years old, a neighborhood kid named Bryan Johnson urinated in her hand (Bryan died of [[leukemia]] two years later). She didn't tell anyone about the incident, until it was revealed to her by Rufus 30 years later.\n\nUpon leaving high school, Bethany attended [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]] with her high school sweetheart, Brett Waits. She gets pregnant sometime in 1981. After an argument on whether or not to have the child with Brett, Bethany gets an [[abortion]]. She tells him, however, that she had a [[miscarriage]].\n\nUpon graduating from Carnegie Mellon, Bethany and Brett get married and attempt to start a family. However, Bethany had an infection inside her [[uterus]] stemming from her abortion years earlier, making her unable to have children. Upon finding out about this after Bethany confesses to Brett about what had really happened, Brett divorces Bethany and some time later, marries another woman.\n\nWhile Bethany is talking to her mother about her personal crises, Bethany loses her faith in God. Shortly afterwards, Bethany settles in [[McHenry, Illinois]] and works at an abortion clinic. However, her faith is restored when she is recruited by the Metatron to save existence from two renegade angels, simultaneously learning that she is the last living relative of Jesus Christ. The unique friendships she forms with various unknown figures from Christian history during her journey, and their insights into her past and the world around her, inspire Bethany to regain her faith and strength. At the film's conclusion, she becomes pregnant as a gift from God for her work in Her efforts.\n\n===Bartleby and Loki {{anchor|Bartleby|Loki}}===\nBartleby and Loki are two characters from ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''. They were portrayed by Ben Affleck and [[Matt Damon]], respectively. Bartleby's name comes from the short story \"[[Bartleby, the Scrivener]]\" and Loki's comes from the [[Loki|Norse god of the same name]].\n\nBack during the earliest days of earth, Bartleby became friends with Loki, the [[Destroying angel (Bible)|Angel of Death]]. After Loki finished [[Plagues of Egypt|slaughtering the first born Egyptians]], the two went out for a post-slaughter drink. During a drunken conversation, Bartleby convinces Loki that he should give up slaughtering humans in the name of God. Loki, taking the advice seriously, presents himself before God, throws down his fiery sword and gives God [[the finger]]. God, enraged by this act, banishes the two to a fate worse than Hell: spending eternity in [[Wisconsin]] (also decreeing that angels can no-longer drink [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]). After a couple of millennia the two are anonymously clued-into a little-known loophole through plenary [[indulgence]], thanks to a New Jersey church celebrating its centennial. The two decide to journey to New Jersey in hopes of getting into Heaven, not knowing that it will wipe out the omniverse in the process.\n\nAfter a mishap on a bus, the two end up getting an update from the demon [[Azrael]] (Jason Lee) about Heaven and Hell's search for them and the threat of the Last Scion (Bethany Sloan ([[Linda Fiorentino]])). The two decide to take his advice to lie low. They take a train to New Jersey, which happens to have Bethany and her friends on it. When their identities are revealed, the two then fight the group until they are thrown out of the moving train by Silent Bob. This is where Bartleby suddenly changes his genial, easy-going attitude to one of angst-ridden revenge against the Lord, and Loki changes his attitude to a more [[Pacifism|pacifist]], meek one. The two walk the rest of their way to Jersey and arrive just in time for the church's centennial celebration. Here, after interrupting, Bartleby and Loki starts to kill everyone at the event one-by-one, knowing their own souls will be clean once they enter the church.\n\nBethany and company arrive at the scene to find a drunken, wingless Loki swirling around dead bodies while Bartleby flies above. When Bartleby announces his plan to his foes, a drunken Loki turns a new leaf and tries to stop Bartleby, because as a side effect of cutting his wings off and becoming human, Loki now has a [[conscience]]. Bartleby stabs Loki in the gut, killing him. After having his wings shot off by Jay, Bartleby heads for the church, but is interrupted by [[Metatron]] ([[Alan Rickman]]) and [[God]] Herself ([[Alanis Morissette]]). Kneeling before Her, Bartleby is killed by the sound of Her voice, with all other humans covering their ears at the time this happens remaining unharmed.\n\nSmith talked about making a one-issue comic book about Bartleby and Loki. It would show the story of how the two are banished to Wisconsin. As of October 2006, the comic is still on his agenda.\n\nA joke made by Ben Affleck in a Train Wreck video for ''Clerks II'' was turned into a rumor that Bartleby would return in said film via a brief cameo appearance. Affleck did make a cameo in the film, but as a new character.\n\n===Cardinal Glick {{anchor|Ignatius Glick|Glick}}===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE3\n| name               = Cardinal Ignatius Glick\n| caption            = Glick in ''Dogma''.\n| first              = ''[[Chasing Dogma]]'' (1998)\n| last               = ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'' (1999)\n| creator            = Kevin Smith\n| portrayer          = [[George Carlin]]\n| occupation         = Cardinal\n| gender             = Male\n}}\nCardinal Glick is a character from ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', played by [[George Carlin]].\n\nGlick was the head minister of a local New Jersey church that is celebrating its centennial. In hopes to get publicity for this event, Glick announces the ''Catholicism WOW!'' campaign which he uses to update the Catholic Church for a younger generation. The leading symbol of the campaign is the [[Buddy Christ]], which Glick describes as a more realistic depiction of [[Jesus Christ]] than the Christ-on-a-Cross depiction. His campaign is nearly put in jeopardy when the film's main characters Bethany, Rufus and Jay and Silent Bob try to stop the centennial celebration so that the two fallen angels Bartleby and Loki can't carry through with their plenary [[indulgence]] plan. Glick refuses to comply due to his needs for the ''WOW'' campaign. The two angels arrive during the celebration and kill all in attendance, including Glick.\n\nGlick can be seen briefly in a few panels of ''[[Chasing Dogma]]''.\n\n==''Clerks: The Animated Series'' (2000)==\n\n===Leonardo Leonardo===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Leonardo Leonardo\n| first              = \"[[Clerks: The Animated Series#Episodes|Leonardo Leonardo Returns and Dante Has an Important Decision to Make]]\" (2002)\n| last               = \"[[Clerks: The Animated Series#Episodes|The Last Episode Ever]]\" (2002)\n| creator            = Kevin Smith\n| portrayer          = [[Alec Baldwin]]\n| occupation         = Billionaire tycoon\n| gender             = Male\n}}\nLeonardo Leonardo, voiced by [[Alec Baldwin]], is a [[billionaire]] villain in ''Clerks: The Animated Series''. In the series' first episode \"Leonardo Leonardo Returns and Dante Has an Important Decision to Make\", it is revealed that in the early 1800s, Leonardo's great-grandfather Bernardo Leonardo purchased the land that was to be Leonardo, NJ, from the Indians for $14.8 million. Leonardo himself achieved his fortune decades ago when he explored parts of Canada and acquired exclusive Canadian mineral rights in exchange for introducing the polio virus to the natives. Leonardo returns to his hometown and introduces the population to his superstore \"Quicker Stop\" in an attempt to put Dante and Randal out of business. His plan fails when the two clerks slash their prices by 75%. He also fails to bribe the clerks into working for him by offering them full benefits, stock options and enrollment in college. Dante and Randal later on discover Leonardo's true motives for returning to the town: he will replace all of the stores with a theme park-style Canadian goods shop, followed by a domed pleasure paradise made to be New Jersey's premier tourist destination. The clerks also discover that Leonardo's scheme involves decimating the town's population. Dante and Randal quickly thwart Leonardo's plan and the Quicker Stop is inadvertently destroyed by Jay and Silent Bob.\n\n===Mr. Plug===\nMr. Plug, voiced by Dan Etheridge, is Leonardo Leonardo's butler. A parody of Oddjob from ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', Mr. Plug has a heavy-set Asian build; his voice, however, is somewhat high-pitched and feminine. It is revealed in the episode \"Leonardo Is Caught in the Grip of an Outbreak of Randal's Imagination and Patrick Swayze Either Does or Doesn't Work in the New Pet Store\" that Mr. Plug is actually a robot.\n\n===Lando===\nLando, voiced by [[Mario Joyner]], is an African-American character introduced by Dante and Randal in the episode \"Leonardo Is Caught in the Grip of an Outbreak of Randal's Imagination and Patrick Swayze Either Does or Doesn't Work in the New Pet Store\" in response to a viewer letter asking why the show does not have any black characters. Seen as a jab on [[tokenism]] (and sharing his name with [[Lando Calrissian]], the token character from [[Star Wars]]), Lando sporadically appears in two episodes, often just walking across the screen. At the end of the aforementioned episode of his debut, he is about to share some words of wisdom with Dante and Randal when the scene suddenly cuts to Jay and Silent Bob's segment.\n\n===Charles Barkley===\n[[Charles Barkley]] voices a fictionalized version of himself. He appears in the show's ending segments trying to educate the kids. However, Jay and Silent Bob always chase him away. In one episode, he appears as part of a basketball team who make up the jury for a court trial between Jay and Dante.\n\n==''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'' (2001)==\n\n===Marshal Willenholly {{anchor|Marshal|Willenholly}}===\nFederal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly is a character from ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back''. His name comes from ''[[Land of the Lost (1974 TV series)|Land of the Lost's]]'' three main characters Rick Marshal, Will and Holly (in a deleted scene, Willenholly called an FBI agent named Sid N. Marty (played by comedian [[Adam Carolla]]), a reference to [[Sid and Marty Krofft]], who created ''Land of the Lost''). The character was portrayed by [[Will Ferrell]], who would later portray the lead character Rick Marshall in the motion picture adaptation of ''Land of the Lost''.\n\nAfter the film's heroes are framed for a jewel heist, Willenholly arrives to investigate the lesser crime that involved the two in the theft of an orangutan named Susanne from the Provasic animal testing facility. Willenholly, along with a slew of [[Utah]] state police officers (the lead played by [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]] member [[Judd Nelson]]) catch the three at the local Arena diner. When Jay and Bob come out with Susanne (dressed as a child), they claim that \"he\" is their gay love child. Willenholly lets them go, not realizing that the \"kid\" was a monkey until it is to late. Willenholly follows them into the sewers and into the duct of a dam. Susanne manages to trick Willenholly to jump out of the duct and into the water so that she, Jay and Bob can escape.\n\nWillenholly later arrives at the station house, soaked from head to toe. There, he receives information that Jay and Bob are going to Hollywood. He ends up on Miramax studios, searching for the two and has a few near fatal mishaps on the way. When Willenholly finds the two on the set of the [[Bluntman and Chronic]] film, he engages in a shootout with the female gang that actually pulled off the jewel heist. After knocking out the three other members of the gang, the fourth member Justice ([[Shannon Elizabeth]]) gives Willenholly the diamonds, confesses to the heist and asks for a reduced sentence so that she could get off to be with Jay. Willenholly, hoping it will boost his career, agrees. Willenholly and Justice are later seen walking out of the ''Bluntman and Chronic'' film premiere, Willenholly being the only character to say something positive about the film. He is also seen dancing at the [[Morris Day and the Time]] concert.\n\n==''Clerks II'' (2006)==\n\n===Becky Scott {{anchor|Becky Scott}}===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE3\n| name               = Rebecca Hicks n\u00e9e Scott\n| first              = ''[[Clerks (comic)#Where's the Beef?|Where's the Beef?]]'' (2006)\n| last               = ''Clerks II'' (2006)\n| creator            = Kevin Smith\n| portrayer          = [[Rosario Dawson]]\n| nickname           = Becky/Becks\n| occupation         = Mooby's restaurant manager\n| spouse             = Dante Hicks\n| gender             = Female\n| family             = Mr. Scott (father)<br>Mrs. Scott (mother)\n| children           = Unnamed child\n| relatives          = Donald Hicks (father-in-law)<br>Mrs. Hicks (mother-in-law) \n}}\nBecky (nicknamed Becks by Dante Hicks and Randal Graves), played by [[Rosario Dawson]], is a lead female character in ''Clerks II''. She is the manager of the [[Mooby the Golden Calf|Mooby's]] that Dante and Randal work at. Dante does her nails [like he did with Veronica in the first film] during his breaks. Becky does not believe in romantic love, instead deciding that life and relationships are about \"fucking as much as possible\"; accusing society of peddling marriage and families in order to sustain the economy.\n\nDuring the course of the film, she develops a relationship with Dante, as they talk to each other very often in the office. When Dante tells her he does not know how to dance, she offers to teach him some steps on the restaurant's rooftop to the tune of the [[Jackson 5]]'s \"[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]]\". During the dance, she reveals to him that she is pregnant, as they had a [[one night stand]] on a restaurant prep table a few weeks back. At the end of the film, Dante breaks off his engagement with Emma and proposes to Becky at Mooby's. She accepts and helps Dante and Randal reopen the Quick Stop.\n\n===Elias Grover {{anchor|Elias Grover}}===\nElias Grover, portrayed by [[Trevor Fehrman]] is a 19-year-old [[born again Christian]] employee at Mooby's alongside Dante and Randal. Elias is obsessed with both ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[Transformers]]'', and is always subjected to Randal's jokes and abuse. Despite constantly harassing him, Randal insists that after Dante leaves for [[Florida]], Elias will be Randal's new best friend. With the aid of Jay and Silent Bob, Elias gets [[Substance intoxication|high]] during the [[donkey show]] that Randal set up at Mooby's and despite his religious views, Elias is seen [[Masturbation|masturbating]] during the show, apologizing to God the whole time. At the end of the film, he applies for a job at RST Video and becomes a clerk after Dante and Randal reopen the Quick Stop.\n\n===Emma Bunting {{anchor|Emma Bunting}}===\n{{distinguish|Emma Bunton}}\nEmma Bunting appears in a supporting role in ''Clerks II''. (She is played by [[Jennifer Schwalbach Smith]], Kevin Smith's wife.) In the beginning of the film, she is engaged to Dante and both are to drive to Florida the next day to live in a new house and run a car wash. She shows her affection for Dante by wearing a T-shirt that reads \"Mrs. Hicks\". Randal, however, sees Emma as a threat to his friendship with Dante. In the middle of the film, Dante falls for Becky. Emma arrives at the restaurant that night and sees them kissing. Angered by the scene, Emma throws her engagement ring at Becky and a cake at Dante and runs off.\n\nEmma was the typical popular, attractive, rich girl in high school, leading her to a series of disappointing relationships as she dated the popular guys. She eventually learned to seek the \"unconventional\" men for a relationship, leading her to Dante.\n\n===Lance Dowds===\nLance Dowds appears in the film ''Clerks II''. He was portrayed by Jason Lee. He was an arrogant student who was [[Bullying|bullied]] frequently in high school, earning the nickname \"Pickle Fucker\" after taking part in a high school hazing which involved the seniors shoving a pickle up his anus. After graduating, he founded a search engine called MadDucats.com and sold it to [[Amazon.com]] for $20 million, making him an Internet multi-millionaire. He appears in just one scene where he criticizes Dante and Randal, who are still working in dead-end minimum wage jobs, before ordering food from them. In response to Lance's comments, Randal prepares his food by secretly placing dead flies on the hamburger and using ice from a urinal for the drink. Lance, however, gives the meal to Jay before leaving the restaurant. Jay and Silent Bob are seen eating the meal outside, with Jay asking Silent Bob, \"This tastes like piss and flies don't it?\"\n\n===The Sexy Stud===\nThe Sexy Stud appears as a supporting role in ''Clerks II''. He is played by [[Zak Charles Knutson]]. He appears near the end of the film during the [[donkey show]] Randal set up as a celebration for Dante's later canceled plans of moving during Florida. Randal at first believed a woman was going to have sex with the donkey, and also believed that the Sexy Stud was the [[pimp]] (Randal first thought that Kelly was the supposed name of the woman while the donkey was the Sexy Stud). However, the Sexy Stud revealed that the donkey is Kelly while he himself was the Sexy Stud. The Sexy Stud performed sexual acts on the donkey that both appall and fascinate Becky, Dante, Randal, Jay and Silent Bob. But Elias, who watched the show as well, was too drunk to be aware that there was no woman in the show. Along with Dante, Randal, Elias, Jay and Silent Bob, the Sexy Stud is arrested as a result of the show. Even though he gets released from jail along with the others, the Sexy Stud is forced to pay a fine for his actions.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Kevin Smith}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of View Askewniverse Characters}}\n[[Category:View Askew characters|*]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Kevin Smith]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|list|date=March 2009}}\n{{Lead too short|date=January 2015}}\n{{Long plot|date=January 2015}}\n}}\n\nThis is a list of major and recurring characters in [[Kevin Smith]]'s fictional universe known as the [[View Askewniverse]].\n\n==''Clerks'' (1994)==\n\n===Dante Hicks===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Dante Hicks\n| first              = ''[[Clerks]]'' (1994)\n| last               = ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]]'' (2019)\n| creator            = [[Kevin Smith]]\n| portrayer          = [[Brian O'Halloran]]\n| occupation         = Quick Stop store clerk/owner<br/>Mooby's restaurant clerk (''Clerks II'')\n| spouse             = Becky Hicks n\u00e9e Scott (''Clerks II'')\n| gender             = Male\n| family             = Donald Hicks (father)<br>Mrs. Hicks (mother)\n| children           = Unnamed child\n| relatives          = Grant Hicks (cousin)<br>Jim Hicks (cousin)<br>Gil Hicks (cousin)<br>Mr. Scott (father-in-law)<br>Mrs. Scott (mother-in-law) \n| significant_other  = Caitlin Bree (ex-girlfriend)<br>Julie Dwyer (ex-girlfriend; deceased)<br>Veronica Loughran (ex-girlfriend)<br>Emma Bunting (ex-fiancee) \n}}\nDante Hicks, played by [[Brian O'Halloran]], is 22 (33 in ''[[Clerks II]]''), works at the Quick Stop Market in [[Leonardo, New Jersey]], and still lives with his parents. He feels that because he runs the store, he is responsible and successful in life, and yet, he is a push-over who often agrees to work when he doesn't have to (hence his catch phrase, \"I'm not even supposed to be here today!\"). He frequently gets into debates ranging from [[philosophy]] to ''[[Star Wars]]'' with his best friend, fellow clerk Randal Graves, who works at the adjacent RST Video Store.\n\nDante is laid-back, personable, articulate, and logical (especially when compared with his best friend Randal), and is easily angered by Randal's actions or behavior, particularly when Randal's actions lead to negative consequences. For example, Dante often scolds Randal for disrespecting customers, while Randal often tries to defend his actions.\n\nThe film centers on the [[Surrealism|surreal]] events of a day at the Quick Stop that Dante must deal with. Among other problems, Dante becomes the target of an anti-smoking mob who pelt him with [[cigarette]]s, and he is issued a [[summons]] and fined for selling cigarettes to a four-year-old, a crime Randal had in fact accidentally committed. In addition, he is continually [[Stalking|stalked]] by [[Jay and Silent Bob]] ([[Jason Mewes]] and [[Kevin Smith]]), two drug dealers who loiter in front of the store all day and often like to go inside and steal. A running gag throughout the film is the scent of [[shoe polish]] on him, as he uses some to write a makeshift open sign to hang over the stuck window shutters of the store.\n\nThe film also deals with Dante's stressful romantic relationships. He has difficulty dealing with his girlfriend Veronica, especially her extensive history of performing [[fellatio]] (on 37 different men, including him) \u2014 even though she seems to genuinely love him, going so far as to bring him [[lasagna]] at work and help him fix a tire. At the same time, Dante is besotted with ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree and seems intent on rekindling that relationship. In the end, Dante ends up with neither woman; Randal ends the relationship by telling Veronica that Dante never got over Caitlin, and Caitlin is hospitalized after accidentally having sex in a dark bathroom with a [[Cadaver|corpse]], whom she had believed to be Dante.\n\nAfter an argument with Veronica, Dante gets into a physical altercation with Randal, and he rants about his anxieties including the loss of his girlfriend and Caitlin, as well as his overall miserable life. He is left speechless when Randal explodes at him, accusing him of blaming everyone else and not taking responsibility for his lack of initiative. The two reconcile and clean up the Quick Stop. In the final scene, he tells Randal that he is going to try and work things out with Veronica. It is implied that he will try to find direction in his life.\n\nIn the film's original ending, after Randal leaves the Quick Stop to go home, a customer comes in, with Dante telling him that the store is closed. The customer responds by pulling out a gun and killing Dante before taking the money from the cash register and leaving. The scene is meant to reference Dante & Randall's earlier discussion; that \"'Empire' was a better film, because it ended on such a down-note\". Kevin Smith's mentors criticized this ending; under the advice of one of the mentors, [[John Pierson (filmmaker)|John Pierson]], Smith edited out that ending. Therefore, the theatrical version ends when Randal leaves.\n\nIn ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', Dante, like Randal, has a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] early in the film in which the two clerks have Jay and Silent Bob arrested for loitering in front of Quick-Stop as well as for selling drugs in front of the store. As a result, a [[restraining order]] was placed on Jay and Silent Bob, who were not allowed within a hundred feet of the store. He and Randal attend the ''Bluntman and Chronic'' movie premiere, where Dante expresses chagrin that [[Judi Dench]] played him in the movie.\n\nIn ''Clerks II'', Dante and Randal are forced to work at a Mooby's fast food restaurant after Randal accidentally leaves a coffee pot on in the Quick Stop, causing the store to burn down. It is revealed that Dante is engaged and is planning to move to [[Florida]] with his fianc\u00e9e Emma. This leaves Randal feeling [[Depression (mood)|depressed]], but does not express his upset at Dante over the decision until near the end of the movie. Randal also expresses his fears of losing Dante; under the persuasion of Randal, Dante decides to stay in [[New Jersey]]. With the two having been fired for Dante's very unconventional bachelor party at Mooby's, the two purchase the Quick Stop and the RST Video, which they restore and co-manage. He also calls off his engagement with Emma in favor of his boss, Becky.\n\nDante briefly appears twice in ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]]''. The first is at the film's opening where he arrives at the Quick Stop to open the store and is quickly pulled aside by police officers. Not knowing what's going on, Dante assumes they are looking for Randal and offers to reveal his location. The second is at the film's end where he complains about the steel shutters being once again jammed with chewed gum, not even noticing Jay, Silent Bob and Jay's daughter Milly. Jay then revealed to Milly that he and Silent Bob had been pranking Dante by purposely putting in chewed gum in the locks for the past twenty-five years.\n\n===Randal Graves===\n{{for|the 19th century New York politician|Randall Graves}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Randal Graves\n| first              = ''[[Clerks]]'' (1994)\n| last               = ''Clerks II'' (2006)\n| creator            = Kevin Smith\n| portrayer          = [[Jeff Anderson]]\n| occupation         = RST Video store clerk/owner<br/>Mooby's restaurant clerk (''Clerks II'')\n| gender             = Male\n| family             = Mrs. Graves (mother) \n| relatives          = Unnamed grandmother<br>Brodie Bruce (cousin)<br>Walter (cousin)\n}}\nRandal Graves, played by [[Jeff Anderson]], is a clerk at RST Video, located next door to the Quick Stop convenience store in [[Leonardo, New Jersey]]. Chris Smith in ''[[The New York Times]]'' described this character as a \"smart-ass\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Register Dogs|author=Chris Smith|publisher=New York Magazine|date=24 Oct 1994}}</ref> while multiple reviewers have described him as a \"super slacker\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The News that Should Have Been|publisher=Game Axis Unwired}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/719/719933p1.html|title = Clerks II Movie Review | publisher =IGN}}</ref> In the first film and the cartoon, Randal is a prime example of the typical [[slacker]]: He works in a dead-end job, has a hatred for customers, and arrives at work late every day. He periodically closes the store (during work hours) to chat with his best friend Dante Hicks, a Quick Stop clerk. Whereas Dante believes that title dictates responsbility, Randal does whatever he pleases.\n\nRandal is usually quite aggressive and offensive (mainly to customers) and doesn't really seem to care much about what others think about him. He regularly arrives at the video store at least 15\u201330 minutes late and charges late fees to customers who have been waiting for the store to open. Often, he ignores customers' requests to recommend a movie, explaining that he does not meddle with other people's affairs (except perhaps those of Dante). He has been known to order [[pornography|porn]] movies for the store in front of children, spit water in customers' faces, and intrude on private conversations about [[Sexual intercourse|sex]].\n\nOne of Randal's ancestors, who was [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], immigrated to [[New Jersey]] in the 17th century. Randal is related to Brodie Bruce of ''Mallrats''. The two share a mutual \"Cousin Walter\", who is known for performing bizarre sexual acts, such as [[Masturbation|masturbating]] on a crashing aircraft and eventually killing himself while attempting to perform auto-fellatio. Both Brodie and Randal also mention stories regarding their grandmother. Brodie once mentioned she became a lesbian on her sixtieth birthday, while Randal mentioned that she used racial slurs in front of him as a child. The latter scenario influenced Randal into using the term \"[[List of ethnic slurs#P|porch monkey]]\" in front of an [[African American]] couple while working at Mooby's. However, Randal did not know at that point that he used a racial slur and claimed he used the term \"porch monkey\" to refer to lazy people of all racial backgrounds in general.\n\nRandal's behavior at times appears contradictory; for example, he says that he hates people but loves social gatherings, and says \"This job would be great if it weren't for the fucking customers\". Such behavior spills into his relationship with Dante, whom he often coerces into highly unlikely, theoretical situations by manipulating him into feeling guilty. Randal goes off on an analytical theory of something outlandish, before going to the complete opposite. He might also perhaps be the worst friend of all time, frequently causing problems in Dante's personal life by spilling secrets to those he shouldn't.\n\nDespite his toxic personality, Randal truly cares for his best friend Dante. He even once said to Dante's ex-girlfriend Caitlin \"Hey Caitlin. Break his heart again, and I'll kill ya. Nothing personal.\" to which Caitlin remarks he has always been very protective of Dante. Randal sees Dante as the \"counterbalance\" to the former's dislike of other people. Randal only goes to Quick Stop instead of staying in the video store to talk to Dante about whatever comes to mind. Randal does his best to offer whatever advice he can to Dante though Dante generally doesn't take it because of Randal's rather rough way of putting it. Randal has also attempted to do favors for Dante, although they often backfire. For example, in ''Clerks 2'', Randal set up a [[donkey show]] as a going-away gift for Dante, who was to move to [[Florida]] with his then-fianc\u00e9e, Emma. However, the show results in Dante and Randal getting arrested (alongside co-worker Elias, and Jay & Silent Bob), leading to a near-breakdown in their friendship. Another example was in ''Clerks'' in which after Randal told Veronica that Dante left her for his ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree. However, not only was Randal unaware that Dante reconsidered his decision to leave Veronica for Caitlin, a fight occurs between Randal and Dante after Veronica told him what Randal told her.\n\nIn ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', Randal, like Dante, has a cameo early in the film in which the two clerks have Jay and Silent Bob arrested for loitering in front of Quick-Stop as well as for selling drugs in front of the store. As a result, a restraining order was placed on Jay and Silent Bob, who were not allowed within a hundred feet of the store. He and Dante attend the ''Bluntman and Chronic'' movie premiere, where Randal mentions putting up another restraining order on Jay and Silent Bob because he is going to give the movie a scathing review on the Internet.\n\nRandal's life centers on movies, [[video game]]s and pornography. He often quotes dialogue and discusses films, goes to other video stores to rent porn, and is often depicted in ''Clerks: The Animated Series'' with a porn magazine. His love life is nonexistent (at least in a romantic sense). The few relationships he had never lasted; his ex-girlfriends were subsequently so fed up with men that they became [[lesbian]]s. In contrast, it is implied he has a budding sex life, despite his overall aimless existence; he frequently has girls over to his house, and brings them over to the Quick Stop when his mother is home. In ''Clerks II'', it is stated that many of his sexual exploits are with \"barely legal pussy\" (18-year-old girls), thanks in no small part to their willingness to take part in taboo sexual acts (such as what he and others refer to bluntly as ass-to-mouth). As evidenced in a scene in ''Clerks II'', Randal's favorite band is [[King Diamond]] and he is a fan of 80s [[speed metal]] and [[black metal]], and dislikes other music, such as the band [[The Time (band)|The Time]]. He is a fan of the novel ''[[Catcher in the Rye]]'' because it \"recognizes the sheer volume of phonies in the world\" [http://www.myspace.com/randalgravesnj]. Randal is also a fan of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy and ''[[Ranger Danger]]'', and staunchly hates the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[Transformers]]''.\n\nRandal is also frequently the cause of the problems that he and Dante get into much to Dante's constant annoyance. The animated series shows this at least once per episode and it is mentioned in ''Clerks II'' that Randal is responsible for several of Dante's ruined relationships. This trait reaches its apex in the third episode of the Animated Series where he almost gets [[Leonardo Leonardo]] destroyed by the [[U.S. Air Force]] after he mistakes the villain's [[food poisoning]] for [[Outbreak (film)|deadly motaba virus]]. It's also revealed here that he got his and Dante's jobs throughout the films and show because when Dante is teasing Randal for always being wrong. Randal retorts, \"What about that time I told you about those two open jobs down the street? You know we'd stay there for a while, earn some money then move on with our lives.\" He then realizes that they've spent practically a decade at their jobs and yells \"Oh my God, you're right, I'm always wrong!\". Randal is based on Smith's long-time friend [[Bryan Johnson (filmmaker)|Bryan Johnson]].<ref name=\"hitfix\">{{cite web|title=Director's career comes full circle with new AMC reality show about his comic shop|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/interview-kevin-smith-talks-comic-book-men|work=hitix.com|author=Alan Sepinwall|date=12 Feb 2012|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nRandal does not appear in ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]]'', but is mentioned by Dante at the beginning of the film when Dante offers to tell the police where Randal is, implying that Randal has, for undisclosed reasons, gone into hiding since the events of ''Clerks II''.\n\n===Veronica Loughran===\nVeronica Loughran, played by [[Marilyn Ghigliotti]], is Dante's girlfriend in the beginning of ''Clerks''. She is currently attending college and frequently makes attempts to encourage Dante to quit his dead-end job at the Quick Stop. Tensions arise between the two during a conversation about sexual relations, when Dante admits to having sex with 12 different women (including Veronica) and Veronica reveals that she performed oral sex on 37 men, including Dante. Later, as an apology, Veronica returns to the Quick Stop with some lasagna for Dante. The relationship ends badly when Randal tells Veronica at the video store that Dante is dumping her to get back with Caitlin, despite the fact that Dante reconsidered this decision; as a result, Veronica storms in at the Quick Stop and attacks Dante before leaving.\n\nVeronica does not appear in the sequel, but she is mentioned in a deleted scene, where Randall calls out Dante for going to [[Brookdale Community College]] just to appease Veronica. This implies they made up after the argument in the first film but subsequently broke up.\n\n===Jay and Silent Bob===\n{{Main|Jay and Silent Bob}}\n\n===Willam Black===\nWillam Black was played by longtime View Askew film editor and producer [[Scott Mosier]] in ''Clerks'', ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'' and ''Clerks II''. He was played by Ethan Suplee in ''Mallrats''. Willam is referred to as an \"idiot man-child\" by other characters in the View Askewniverse, mostly because of his limited intelligence and demeanor (glazed eyes, unkempt hair and beard, and lack of coordination). He has an oddly profane sexual taste, which includes [[Snowballing (sexual practice)|snowballing]], thus giving him his other nickname, \"Snowball\". He is often seen staring at ceilings and saying \"That's beautiful, man!\"\n\n===Caitlin Bree===\nCaitlin Bree first appeared in ''Clerks''. She was portrayed by [[Lisa Spoonauer]]. She was one of Dante's old girlfriends. Both of them express a desire to restart their relationship. At the end of the film, however, she has sex with a corpse at the Quick Stop bathroom, believing it to be Dante. She is sent a mental institution to deal with her trauma afterward.\n\nIt was revealed in ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' that Caitlin and [[Alyssa Jones]] had a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] relationship that included [[fisting]].\n\nIn the comic book ''[[Clerks. (comics)|Clerks: The Holiday Special]]'', Dante visits Caitlin at the [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] located in [[Marlboro Township, New Jersey|Marlboro]]. Caitlin has not spoken a word since the incident, prompting Randal to suggest that Dante [[fornicate]] with Caitlin using a [[candy cane]]. Caitlin awakens from her state, but is furious and does not want to see him again.\n\nCaitlin was also mentioned in ''[[Clerks: The Lost Scene]]'' and ''Clerks II''.\n\nIn Kevin Smith's never-produced script ''Superman Lives'', the governor is named Caitlin Bree. It is assumed, but not confirmed, to be the same Bree from \"Clerks\".\n\nSmith named the character after his favorite ''[[Degrassi (franchise)|Degrassi]]'' character, [[Caitlin Ryan (Degrassi)|Caitlin Ryan]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pYG5eRoSTJwC&pg=PA46&dq=%22caitlin+ryan%22+degrassi&cd=3#v=onepage&q=%22caitlin%20ryan%22%20degrassi&f=false |title=SPIN \u2013 Google Books |accessdate=2010-05-23|date=August 2005 }}</ref>\n\n===Julie Dwyer===\nJulie Dwyer was first mentioned in ''Clerks'' as an old high school friend of Dante Hicks and Randal Graves who died at a [[swimming pool]] at a [[YMCA]]. Her funeral scene was eventually shown (in animated form), in ''[[Clerks: The Lost Scene]]'', which appeared on the ''Clerks X'' DVD set. In ''Mallrats'' (which takes place the day before ''Clerks.''), Dwyer is told that the camera adds 10 pounds, so she over-exercises before her appearance on the game show ''Truth or Date'', which leads to her death. She is mentioned in ''Chasing Amy'' as a friend of Alyssa Jones. She is referred to again in ''Clerks II'', where Randal mentions going to her funeral and his claim that Dante said he needs to \"shit or get off the pot\" (which Dante claims was actually said by Randal).\n\n===Rick Derris===\nFirst appearing in ''[[Clerks]]'', Rick Derris was played by [[Ernest O'Donnell]],  (a childhood friend of Kevin Smith). Rick is a sexual deviant in the Askewniverse. In ''Clerks'', while bragging about being more physically fit than Dante Hicks, he reveals to Dante that he had sex with his ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree during their five-year relationship.\n\nIn ''[[Mallrats]]'', Gwen Turner, T.S. Quint, and Brodie Bruce recall an incident at a costume party in which Derris and Turner had sex on a pool table. While Turner thinks it was a trivial event, Bruce and Quint remember the event very well because Derris and Turner were having sex on a pool table while dressed as [[Jackie Gleason]] and [[Burt Reynolds]], respectively, from ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]''. In ''[[Chasing Amy]]'', Derris and his friend Cohee London engaged in a three-way with Tricia Jones's older sister [[Alyssa Jones]] during high school, which gave her the nickname \"Finger Cuffs\". When Alyssa is confronted by Holden McNeil about this occurrence during ''Chasing Amy'', Ernest O'Donnell makes a cameo sitting next to them and listening in. He was planned to be Jay's older brother, but as the movie in which this point would be addressed was never produced, Kevin Smith has stated that this is no longer the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/9588|title=The Kevin Smith Sessions Part II of IV| publisher =Ain't It Cool}}</ref>\n\n===Old Man===\nAn unnamed elderly man, played by Al Berkowitz, approaches Dante and asks to use the restroom, which is normally for employees only. He disappears into the restroom after harassing Dante for a softer roll of toilet paper and a porno magazine to read. It is later on revealed that he dies of a heart attack while masturbating over the magazine; his body maintains an erection as a result of [[rigor mortis]]. Dante does not take notice of this due to him closing the store to play hockey on the roof and attend Julie Dwyer's wake. In addition, the restroom light shuts off automatically at 5:14&nbsp;p.m. for reasons unknown. As a result, Caitlin Bree winds up having sex with the elderly man's corpse, mistaking it for Dante.\n\n===Chewlies Representative===\nA customer, played by Scott Schiaffo, pays for a cup of coffee and asks Dante if he can drink it beside the register counter. He then confronts a younger customer who is about to buy a pack of cigarettes, pulling out a cancer-ridden lung out of his handbag and showing him several effects of smoking before persuading him to buy a pack of Chewlies gum instead. Later on, he instigates a small demonstration in the store by calling Dante a \"merchant of death\" and encouraging customers to throw cigarettes at him. The revolt is stopped by Veronica, who sprays everyone with a fire extinguisher before stopping the customer from exiting. After discovering that he is a Chewlies representative, she tells him to leave before telling the other customers to go back to their jobs.\n\n===Olaf the Russian Metalhead===\nOlaf, played by John Henry Westhead, is introduced by Jay as Silent Bob's [[Russia]]n cousin. He is from [[Moscow]] and speaks very little English, but according to Jay, he runs a heavy metal band back in Russia and is looking to do a gig in [[New York City]]. A running gag throughout the film is Olaf's song \"Berserker\". A shirt for Olaf's band is worn by Jay throughout ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]''.\n\n==''Mallrats'' (1995)==\n\n===Brodie Bruce===\n{{Infobox character \n| colour             =#DEDEE2 \n| name               = Brodie Bruce \n| first              = ''[[Mallrats]]'' (1995) \n| last               = ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]]'' (2019) \n| creator            = [[Kevin Smith]] \n| portrayer          = [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]\n| occupation         = owner of \"Brodie's Secret Stash\"<br>Host of The Tonight Show (formerly)  \n| gender             = Male \n| family             = Mr. Bruce (father)<br>Mrs. Bruce (mother) \n| relatives          = Randal Graves (cousin)<br>Walter (cousin)\n| significant_other  = Rene Mosier (girlfriend) \n}}\nBrodie Bruce ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]) is an unemployed, lazy, comic book-obsessed, [[Sega]]-playing [[slacker]], living with his parents and lacking the initiative and prospects appropriate to his age. Kevin Smith has said [[Walt Flanagan]] was the inspiration for the character.<ref name=\"hitfix\" /> Brodie is named after the main character in ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (a favorite film of Smith's, and one the director frequently references in his work), while his surname, Bruce, was the nickname given to the animatronic shark in ''Jaws''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nHis girlfriend, Rene Mosier, to whom Brodie's mother has never been introduced (out of fear on the part of Brodie), breaks up with him at the beginning of ''Mallrats'' and gives him a letter listing the reasons for doing so. At the end of the film they are back together, and it is mentioned that he went on to host ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', with Rene as his band leader and having gained the approval from his mother. He makes a brief appearance in ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'' in which he now owns his own comic book store called \"[[Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash|Brodie's Secret Stash]]\".\n\n===Rene Mosier===\nRene Mosier ([[Shannen Doherty]]) is Brodie's girlfriend. She broke up with him prior to the events of the film and began dating Shannon Hamilton, a clothing store manager at the mall. Brodie confronts her about the relationship, an encounter that leads to the two having sex in an elevator. Shannon later assaults Brodie and claims that he and Rene will have sex in a \"[[Anal sex|very uncomfortable place]]\" (interpreted to be the back of a [[Volkswagen]]). However, this apparently never happens as Shannon is later arrested after ''Truth or Date'' for statutory rape, and Brodie and Rene reconcile. Later, when Brodie becomes the host of ''The Tonight Show'', Rene serves as his bandleader.\n\nRene's last name is a reference to frequent Kevin Smith collaborator and close friend [[Scott Mosier]]. As a nod to her actor, who was well known for her role as [[Brenda Walsh (character)|Brenda Walsh]] on ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', she is mistakenly referred to as \"Brenda\" by Willam at one point.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MkfLxUKLd0YC&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q&f=false |title = An Askew View: The Films of Kevin Smith|isbn = 9781557835864|last1 = Muir|first1 = John Kenneth|year = 2002}}</ref>\n\n===Shannon Hamilton===\nShannon Hamilton is a character from ''[[Mallrats]]'' played by [[Ben Affleck]].\n\nIn the film, Shannon is the manager of the Fashionable Male clothing store. He is the arch enemy of Brodie Bruce ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]), a local mallrat and a major character in the film. It is revealed that Shannon is dating Bruce's ex-girlfriend Rene Mosier ([[Shannen Doherty]]), who dumped Bruce that morning and also has \"no respect for people with no shopping agenda\". Shannon later abducts Bruce and beats him severely, saying that he likes comforting girls on the rebound of unsuccessful relationships so that he can \"[[anal sex|fuck them in an uncomfortable place]]\", which Bruce asks if it's the back of a [[Volkswagen]]. This becomes a running joke in the film. Also, Tricia Jones (Renee Humphrey) reveals that she had sex with Hamilton as research for her book ''Borgasm: A Study of the 90s Male Sexual Prowess''. She even taped their sexual encounter. During the ''Truth or Date'' game show, Bruce announces his love for Rene, which angers Hamilton. Just before he can assault Bruce, [[Jay and Silent Bob|Silent Bob]] starts the video tape of Hamilton and Tricia Jones' sexual encounter that is played on the ''Truth or Date'' big screens. When Bruce tells the police that Jones is 15 years old, Hamilton is arrested for [[statutory rape]] (while protesting \"I thought she was 36!\"). During the conclusion, it is said that \"Shannon made a lot of friends at the Rahway State Correctional Facility\" and see a hand wrap around Hamilton's, with \"Love\" tattooed on his fingers.\n\nShannon is mentioned in ''Chasing Amy'', when Alyssa Jones says she had sex with him in college, only to have a tape of their sexual encounter be broadcast all over campus, thus retroactively making his comeuppance in Mallrats a case of poetic justice. In ''[[Clerks. (comics)|Clerks: The Comic Book]]'', Shannon's face is seen on a milk carton which says he is missing.\n\nWhen Kevin Smith was talking about making a sequel to ''Mallrats'' with the comic book ''Mallrats 2: [[Die Hard]] in a Mall'', he stated that Hamilton would be the main villain.\n\n===Tricia Jones===\nTricia Jones first appeared in the film ''Mallrats''. She was portrayed by [[Renee Humphrey]].\n\nTricia is the 15-year-old sister of Alyssa Jones and the author of ''Boregasm'', a look into the [[libido|sex drive]] of men between the ages of 14 and 30, which was later made into a movie.\n\nWhile writing the book, she kept a journal of all the men with whom she had sex, and video taped every experience. The archived videos were used to help Brodie Bruce win back his ex-girlfriend, Rene, from his nemesis Shannon Hamilton.\n\nUpon Brodie's urgent request, she gave Jay the tape of her sexual encounter with Shannon. Silent Bob was able to hack into the video output and play the tape during the live taping of ''Truth or Date''. Shannon was thereafter arrested for [[statutory rape]].\n\nIn the comic series ''[[Chasing Dogma]]'', Jay and Silent Bob are seen living with Tricia, only to be kicked out after months of loafing around (and after Jay spied on her in the shower). It is revealed that she had slept with Silent Bob (but not Jay, much to Jay's annoyance) as part of research for ''Boregasm''.\n\nTricia is briefly mentioned in ''Chasing Amy'', when her sister Alyssa Jones informed Holden McNeil via telephone that her \"sister is in town\", to which McNeil replies, \"the one who wrote the book?\" Tricia also makes a brief appearance in ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', where she discusses ''[[Bluntman and Chronic|The Bluntman and Chronic Movie]]'' with Alyssa.\n\n===Gwen Turner===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Gwen Turner\n| caption            = Gwen Turner in ''Mallrats''.\n| first              = ''Mallrats'' (1995)\n| last               = [[Clerks (comic)#Where's the Beef?|Where's the Beef?]] (2006)\n| creator            = Kevin Smith\n| portrayer          = [[Joey Lauren Adams]]\n| gender             = Female\n| significant_other  = T.S.

She was portrayed by [[Joey Lauren Adams]].\n\nTurner was the ex-girlfriend of T.S. Quint, one of the main characters played by [[Jeremy London]]. Despite cheating on him constantly, she still maintains a soft-spot for him.\n\nThroughout ''Mallrats'', Gwen is seen interacting with T.S. and Brodie. Her clothes shopping is often interrupted by Silent Bob crashing into her dressing room as she is changing. She also causes a major story point when she convinces Brandi Svenning ([[Claire Forlani]]) that T.S. was in fact a great boyfriend.\n\nGwen has been mentioned in other View Askew media. In ''Chasing Amy'', Alyssa Jones mentioned that she left her prom so that she could have sex with her 26-year-old date and Gwen in a limo her parents had rented (this is something of an in-joke, as both Turner and Jones were played by the same actress). Also, in the ''Clerks'' comic book [[Clerks. (comics)|Where's the Beef?]], Randal mentions that Dante Hicks tried to impress Gwen by wearing a [[Batman]] costume and standing on a roof top.\n\n===LaFours===\nLaFours is a fictional character from the film, Mallrats, who works as chief security guard at the local mall. He was portrayed by [[Sven-Ole Thorsen]].\n\nLaFours is considered (even by Jay and Silent Bob) as one of the most intimidating security guards on duty, due to his size and strength; in fact he's even got \"two kills\" on his record.\n\nWhilst attempting to get past LaFours in the destruction of the \"Truth or Date\" stage, Jay and Silent Bob mess up, resulting in both of them being pursued by him.\nWe later see the chief security guard attempting to evict T.S. and Brodie from the mall, only to get hit from behind by Jay with a [[baseball bat]]. LaFours and his team attempt to take both him and Silent Bob down, but lose track of him when they use a [[grappling hook]]. He is also seen having [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with Tricia Jones later in the film. In the [[epilogue]], he acquires a signed copy of Tricia's book (and perhaps even struck up a romance with her).\n\nWe also see LaFours on a large [[Bluntman and Chronic]] front cover, as seen at the comic book convention in Chasing Amy.\n\nLaFours is a historical/movie reference to Joe LeFors from ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''. Both characters wear white skimmers and both are portrayed as legendary law enforcers within their respective films.\n\n===T.S. Quint {{anchor|T.S.|T.S}}===\n{{Infobox character \n| colour             = #DEDEE2 \n| name               = T.S.

Quint (referred to as ''T.S.'' by friends) is one of the main characters in ''Mallrats''. He was portrayed by [[Jeremy London]].\n\nIn the film, T.S. is having trouble with his girlfriend Brandi Svenning ([[Claire Forlani]]) dealing with her authoritarian father ([[Michael Rooker]]). He tries to convince her to go to [[Florida]], where he planned to propose to her at [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] when [[Jaws (ride)|\"Jaws pops out of the water\"]]. This was ruined, however, when Brandi had to fill in for [[Julie Dwyer]] on her father's ''Truth or Date'' television pilot. T.S., showing his anger, causes Brandi to break up with him.\n\nFilled with grief, T.S. joins fellow newly dumped best friend Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) on a road trip to the local mall. Amongst many activities, the two realize that Mr. Svenning's ''Truth or Date'' is being filmed live at the mall that evening. After being kicked out by mall security under Svenning's orders, Brodie and T.S. get sage-like advise from a topless psychic in a dirt mall and return to stop the dating show. The duo successfully sabotage the show and T.S. finally proposes to Brandi, ending up with the two sharing a kiss.\n\nIn an epilogue to the film, it is revealed that T.S. and Brandi got married after they graduated at Universal Studios in Florida. They share their first husband-to-wife kiss just as [[Jaws (film)|Jaws]] pops out of the water.\n\nIn the original opening scene of ''Mallrats'', while at the 37th Annual Governor's Ball, T.S., dressed as a Revolutionary Soldier for a musical at the event, gets a musket tied up in Brandi's hair while on the roof of the high school where the event is being held. The governor's security believe it's an assassination attempt and the event turns into a shoot out. The governor is injured and ruins the chance of Svenning getting a check from her. Throughout this version, people in the mall recognize T.S. from television, to which he responds \"I got a musket tied up in my girlfriend's hair for God's sakes\". This line of the plot is referenced in the theatrical version of film when one of the television producers mentions the Governor's ball to Svenning.\n\n===Steve-Dave Pulasti and Walt Grover {{anchor|Steve-Dave Pulsati|Steve Pulsati|Dave Pulsati|Walt Grover|Steve-Dave}}===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE3\n| name               = Steve-Dave Pulasti and Walt Grover\n| first              = ''Mallrats'' (1995)\n| last               = ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'' (2001)\n| creator            = Kevin Smith\n| portrayer          = [[Bryan Johnson (filmmaker)|Bryan Johnson]]<br>[[Walt Flanagan]]\n| nickname           = Walt The Fanboy\n| alias              = Walt Flanagan\n| occupation         = Comic Books Store Owners\n| gender             = Male\n}}\nSteve-Dave Pulasti (usually referred to as Steve-Dave) and Walt \"the Fanboy\" Grover made their first appearance in ''Mallrats''. They are played by Smith's longtime friends [[Bryan Johnson (filmmaker)|Bryan Johnson]] and [[Walt Flanagan]], respectively. Walt has a signature catchphrase; whenever Steve-Dave argues with a character, his comments will be followed by Walt saying \"''Tell 'em Steve-Dave!''\"\n\nAccording to Johnson, the character of Steve-Dave is based on the owner of a comic book store that Smith, Johnson, and Flanagan once frequented; \"Walter could never remember if the guy's name was actually Steve or Dave. So the name Steve-Dave was coined.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|last1       = Muir\n|first1      = John Kenneth\n|year        = 2002\n|title       = An Askew View: The Films of Kevin Smith\n|url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=MkfLxUKLd0YC&pg=PA79\n|publisher   = [[Hal Leonard Corporation]]\n|page        = 79\n|access-date = 2018-06-15\n|isbn = 9781557835864\n}}</ref>\n\nSteve-Dave and Walt also appeared briefly in ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''; they had scenes in ''Chasing Amy'' and ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'' that were cut from the final edit.\n\nThe duo have also appeared in most of the comic books based on the Askewniverse. They also appeared in a Jay and Silent Bob [[MTV]] short.\n\nThe duo have been made into [[action figures]].\n\n===Jared Svenning===\nJared is the father of Brandi Svenning, T.S's girlfriend. He is portrayed by [[Michael Rooker]].\n\nJared is T.S's [[antagonist]] throughout the film, and Jared is seen being happy that Brandi and T.S. broke up. He is also in charge of the TV game show ''Truth or Date'' in which one of its shows was to take place at the local mall. After a confrontation with T.S. and during a new meeting with him, Brodie stinkpalms (In which Brodie inserted his own hand up his butt) Jared by shaking his hand and offering him chocolate pretzels (in which Jared holds every pretzel he eats with the hand that he shook Brodie's stink-palmed hand with). Jared unsuccessfully has Brodie and T.S. arrested, but they are rescued by Jay and Silent Bob. Jared becomes ill after getting stink-palmed, and his show is ruined.\n\n===Willam===\nWillam is a minor character in both ''[[Clerks]]'' (where he was portrayed by [[Scott Mosier]]) and ''Mallrats'' (portrayed by [[Ethan Suplee]]).<ref>http://www.avclub.com/article/ethan-suplee-deepwater-horizon-mallrats-and-not-kn-242980 Interview with Ethan Suplee</ref> Throughout the film he is seen trying to find a [[sailboat]] within an [[autostereogram]], constantly failing at it while other characters, including T.S., Brodie, Rene, some kids, and [[Stan Lee]], succeed. At the end of the film he finally snaps and wanders around the mall moaning about the sailboat, unknowingly hitting the stage at a crucial point when Silent Bob is trying to retrieve a video tape he dropped and causing it to go right back into Silent Bob's hands. During the credits it is revealed that Willam eventually found the sailboat, although Willam himself seems surprised. In subsequent comic books, Willam makes cameo roles, still lamenting about the sailboat.\n\n==''Chasing Amy'' (1997)==\n\n===Holden McNeil {{anchor|Holden}}===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE3\n| name               = Holden McNeil\n| first              = ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997)\n| last               = ''Jay and Silent Bob Reboot'' (2019)\n| creator            = Kevin Smith\n| portrayer          = [[Ben Affleck]]\n| occupation         = Comic Book Creator\n| gender             = Male\n| children           = Amy Jones (biological daughter) \n| significant_other  = Alyssa Jones (ex-girlfriend; also co-parent of his child) \n}}\nHolden McNeil is the main character in the film ''Chasing Amy''. The character is played by Ben Affleck. Throughout the film he is trying to develop a working relationship with Alyssa Jones, who is a [[lesbian]]. He is the co-creator of the fictitious comic book [[Bluntman and Chronic]]. Kevin Smith has stated that Holden is the View Askewniverse character most similar to himself.\n\nHolden also appears in ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', living in a small barnhouse and giving Jay and Silent Bob information about the [[internet]]. He was named after the lead character [[Holden Caulfield]] from ''[[Catcher in the Rye]]''.\n\n===Banky Edwards===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE3\n| name               = Banky Edwards\n| first              = ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997)\n| last               = ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' (2001)\n| creator            = Kevin Smith\n| portrayer          = Jason Lee\n| occupation         = Comic Book Creator/Inker\n| gender             = Male\n| significant_other  = Hooper LaMante (boyfriend) \n}}\nBanky Edwards is a major supporting character in ''Chasing Amy''. He was played by Jason Lee. Banky is Holden McNeil's lifelong best friend and co-created the smash hit ''Bluntman & Chronic'' with him. Banky is very protective of Holden and finds his infatuation with Alyssa Jones to be disgusting. He also exhibits many examples of ignorant [[Homophobia|homophobic]] behavior throughout the film, which eventually leads to him and Holden breaking off their friendship, ending the comic.\n\nBanky returned in ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back''. Having received exclusive movie rights for Bluntman and Chronic, Banky has allowed a film adaptation to go through production which sets Jay and Silent Bob on an adventure to stop this from taking place. Banky is on the set when Jay and Silent Bob arrive, attempting to make [[Hollywood]] connections. After arguing with the two stoners while a gun fight is taking place, Banky agrees to give the two of them part of his profits in exchange for the film going through. However, the film turns out to be a huge bomb which effectively ends Edwards' career.\n\nIn ''Chasing Amy'', Banky, an inker on ''Bluntman and Chronic'', is accused by a comic book fan ([[Scott Mosier]]) of being \"a tracer\", which leads to a fight. In a deleted scene from ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', the fan returns to call Banky a tracer once again, which results in another confrontation.\n\n===Hooper LaMante {{anchor|Hooper}}===\nHooper LaMante (a.k.a. Hooper X) is a character from ''Chasing Amy'' played by [[Dwight Ewell]]. A gay man himself, he tells Holden to accept Alyssa's sexuality and try not to worry about it.\n\nHooper is seen again at the end of ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', walking out of the premiere of the ''[[Bluntman and Chronic|Bluntman and Chronic: The Movie]]'' with Banky. While Banky is in shock of the fact that the movie will ruin him, Hooper says that the movie was like \"watching ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' all over again\". It's also implied that he has at least a sexual relationship with Banky; when Banky makes a remark about Hooper \"taking shaft as opposed to being Shaft\" Hooper replies \"I don't hear you complaining.\"\n\nIn an extended deleted scene, we hear Hooper continuing, \"Well, I don't hear you complaining nightly. In fact, all I hear from you is, 'Yes, Hooper. Cram the balls! Work the shaft! And...\" To which Banky responds \"Hey! Hey, HEY! What'd we say? Not in public.\" \n\n===Alyssa Jones===\n{{Infobox character \n| colour             = #DEDEE3 \n| name               = Alyssa Jones \n| first              = ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997) \n| last               = ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]]'' (2019)\n| creator            = [[Kevin Smith]]\n| portrayer          = [[Joey Lauren Adams]] \n| occupation         = Comic book artist \n| spouse             = Unnamed wife \n| gender             = Female \n| family             = Tricia Jones (sister)<br>Heather Jones (sister) \n| children           = Amy Jones (daughter) \n| significant_other  = Caitlin Bree (fling)<br>Two unnamed guys (hookups)<br>Shannon Hamilton (one night stand)<br>Gwen Turner (one night stand)<br>Unnamed man (one night stand)<br>Holden McNeil (ex-boyfriend; also co-parent of her child) \n}}\nAlyssa Jones is the main character in the film ''Chasing Amy''. She is played by Joey Lauren Adams. \n\nIn ''Chasing Amy'', she meets Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards at a comic book convention in New York where the two men are promoting their comic Bluntman and Chronic. Holden is attracted to her, but soon learns that she is attracted to women. The two begin hanging out and both of them develop a deep friendship, however, Holden is no longer able to contain his feelings and confesses his love to Alyssa. She at first is initially angry with him, but that night, the two begin a romantic relationship. Their new relationship worsens the tension between Holden and Banky, who dislikes and distrusts Alyssa and is bothered by her and Holden's relationship. Banky investigates and uncovers Alyssa's past and he tells Holden that Alyssa participated in a threesome with two guys in high school which gave her the nickname \"Finger Cuffs\". Holden is deeply disturbed by this revelation, having believed that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept with. Holden angrily confronts Alyssa while attending a hockey game. During a tearful argument, she admits to Holden about her \"many\" youthful sexual experimentations and apologizes for letting him believe that he was the only man she had been with, however, she refuses to apologize for her past actions, and Holden leaves feeling angry and confused. Inspired by Silent Bob's story, Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his fractured friendship with Banky. Holden invites both of them over to his place and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain as her boyfriend and also tells Banky that he realizes that Banky is in love with him; kissing him passionately to prove the point. Holden suggests that the three of them have a threesome. While Banky agrees to participate, however, Alyssa refuses, explaining to Holden that it will not save their relationship. Before leaving, Alyssa tells Holden that she loves him, but she will not be his whore. One year later, Alyssa is busy promoting her new comic at a convention in New York, where Banky (also promoting his comics in the same convention) gestures Holden to her booth and provides wordless encouragement to talk to her. They have a quiet, emotional conversation and Holden gives her a copy of his new comic \"Chasing Amy\", which is based on their relationship and tells her goodbye. After Holden leaves, Alyssa's new girlfriend arrives and asks who he was. A shaken, misty-eyed Alyssa replies, \"Oh, just some guy I knew\". \n{{Clear}}\n\n==''Dogma'' (1999)==\n\n===Bethany Sloane===\nBethany Sloane is played by actress [[Linda Fiorentino]]. Bethany was born in 1961 (which makes her 38 during the events in ''Dogma''), and was raised as a devout [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. When she was five years old, a neighborhood kid named Bryan Johnson urinated in her hand (Bryan died of [[leukemia]] two years later). She didn't tell anyone about the incident, until it was revealed to her by Rufus 30 years later.\n\nUpon leaving high school, Bethany attended [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]] with her high school sweetheart, Brett Waits. She gets pregnant sometime in 1981. After an argument on whether or not to have the child with Brett, Bethany gets an [[abortion]]. She tells him, however, that she had a [[miscarriage]].\n\nUpon graduating from Carnegie Mellon, Bethany and Brett get married and attempt to start a family. However, Bethany had an infection inside her [[uterus]] stemming from her abortion years earlier, making her unable to have children. Upon finding out about this after Bethany confesses to Brett about what had really happened, Brett divorces Bethany and some time later, marries another woman.\n\nWhile Bethany is talking to her mother about her personal crises, Bethany loses her faith in God. Shortly afterwards, Bethany settles in [[McHenry, Illinois]] and works at an abortion clinic. However, her faith is restored when she is recruited by the Metatron to save existence from two renegade angels, simultaneously learning that she is the last living relative of Jesus Christ. The unique friendships she forms with various unknown figures from Christian history during her journey, and their insights into her past and the world around her, inspire Bethany to regain her faith and strength. At the film's conclusion, she becomes pregnant as a gift from God for her work in Her efforts.\n\n===Bartleby and Loki {{anchor|Bartleby|Loki}}===\nBartleby and Loki are two characters from ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''. They were portrayed by Ben Affleck and [[Matt Damon]], respectively. Bartleby's name comes from the short story \"[[Bartleby, the Scrivener]]\" and Loki's comes from the [[Loki|Norse god of the same name]].\n\nBack during the earliest days of earth, Bartleby became friends with Loki, the [[Destroying angel (Bible)|Angel of Death]]. After Loki finished [[Plagues of Egypt|slaughtering the first born Egyptians]], the two went out for a post-slaughter drink. During a drunken conversation, Bartleby convinces Loki that he should give up slaughtering humans in the name of God. Loki, taking the advice seriously, presents himself before God, throws down his fiery sword and gives God [[the finger]]. God, enraged by this act, banishes the two to a fate worse than Hell: spending eternity in [[Wisconsin]] (also decreeing that angels can no-longer drink [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]). After a couple of millennia the two are anonymously clued-into a little-known loophole through plenary [[indulgence]], thanks to a New Jersey church celebrating its centennial. The two decide to journey to New Jersey in hopes of getting into Heaven, not knowing that it will wipe out the omniverse in the process.\n\nAfter a mishap on a bus, the two end up getting an update from the demon [[Azrael]] (Jason Lee) about Heaven and Hell's search for them and the threat of the Last Scion (Bethany Sloan ([[Linda Fiorentino]])). The two decide to take his advice to lie low. They take a train to New Jersey, which happens to have Bethany and her friends on it. When their identities are revealed, the two then fight the group until they are thrown out of the moving train by Silent Bob. This is where Bartleby suddenly changes his genial, easy-going attitude to one of angst-ridden revenge against the Lord, and Loki changes his attitude to a more [[Pacifism|pacifist]], meek one. The two walk the rest of their way to Jersey and arrive just in time for the church's centennial celebration. Here, after interrupting, Bartleby and Loki starts to kill everyone at the event one-by-one, knowing their own souls will be clean once they enter the church.\n\nBethany and company arrive at the scene to find a drunken, wingless Loki swirling around dead bodies while Bartleby flies above. When Bartleby announces his plan to his foes, a drunken Loki turns a new leaf and tries to stop Bartleby, because as a side effect of cutting his wings off and becoming human, Loki now has a [[conscience]]. Bartleby stabs Loki in the gut, killing him. After having his wings shot off by Jay, Bartleby heads for the church, but is interrupted by [[Metatron]] ([[Alan Rickman]]) and [[God]] Herself ([[Alanis Morissette]]). Kneeling before Her, Bartleby is killed by the sound of Her voice, with all other humans covering their ears at the time this happens remaining unharmed.\n\nSmith talked about making a one-issue comic book about Bartleby and Loki. It would show the story of how the two are banished to Wisconsin. As of October 2006, the comic is still on his agenda.\n\nA joke made by Ben Affleck in a Train Wreck video for ''Clerks II'' was turned into a rumor that Bartleby would return in said film via a brief cameo appearance.

In hopes to get publicity for this event, Glick announces the ''Catholicism WOW!'' campaign which he uses to update the Catholic Church for a younger generation. The leading symbol of the campaign is the [[Buddy Christ]], which Glick describes as a more realistic depiction of [[Jesus Christ]] than the Christ-on-a-Cross depiction. His campaign is nearly put in jeopardy when the film's main characters Bethany, Rufus and Jay and Silent Bob try to stop the centennial celebration so that the two fallen angels Bartleby and Loki can't carry through with their plenary [[indulgence]] plan. Glick refuses to comply due to his needs for the ''WOW'' campaign. The two angels arrive during the celebration and kill all in attendance, including Glick.\n\nGlick can be seen briefly in a few panels of ''[[Chasing Dogma]]''.\n\n==''Clerks: The Animated Series'' (2000)==\n\n===Leonardo Leonardo===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Leonardo Leonardo\n| first              = \"[[Clerks: The Animated Series#Episodes|Leonardo Leonardo Returns and Dante Has an Important Decision to Make]]\" (2002)\n| last               = \"[[Clerks: The Animated Series#Episodes|The Last Episode Ever]]\" (2002)\n| creator            = Kevin Smith\n| portrayer          = [[Alec Baldwin]]\n| occupation         = Billionaire tycoon\n| gender             = Male\n}}\nLeonardo Leonardo, voiced by [[Alec Baldwin]], is a [[billionaire]] villain in ''Clerks: The Animated Series''. In the series' first episode \"Leonardo Leonardo Returns and Dante Has an Important Decision to Make\", it is revealed that in the early 1800s, Leonardo's great-grandfather Bernardo Leonardo purchased the land that was to be Leonardo, NJ, from the Indians for $14.8 million. Leonardo himself achieved his fortune decades ago when he explored parts of Canada and acquired exclusive Canadian mineral rights in exchange for introducing the polio virus to the natives. Leonardo returns to his hometown and introduces the population to his superstore \"Quicker Stop\" in an attempt to put Dante and Randal out of business. His plan fails when the two clerks slash their prices by 75%. He also fails to bribe the clerks into working for him by offering them full benefits, stock options and enrollment in college. Dante and Randal later on discover Leonardo's true motives for returning to the town: he will replace all of the stores with a theme park-style Canadian goods shop, followed by a domed pleasure paradise made to be New Jersey's premier tourist destination. The clerks also discover that Leonardo's scheme involves decimating the town's population. Dante and Randal quickly thwart Leonardo's plan and the Quicker Stop is inadvertently destroyed by Jay and Silent Bob.\n\n===Mr. Plug===\nMr. Plug, voiced by Dan Etheridge, is Leonardo Leonardo's butler. A parody of Oddjob from ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', Mr. Plug has a heavy-set Asian build; his voice, however, is somewhat high-pitched and feminine. It is revealed in the episode \"Leonardo Is Caught in the Grip of an Outbreak of Randal's Imagination and Patrick Swayze Either Does or Doesn't Work in the New Pet Store\" that Mr. Plug is actually a robot.\n\n===Lando===\nLando, voiced by [[Mario Joyner]], is an African-American character introduced by Dante and Randal in the episode \"Leonardo Is Caught in the Grip of an Outbreak of Randal's Imagination and Patrick Swayze Either Does or Doesn't Work in the New Pet Store\" in response to a viewer letter asking why the show does not have any black characters. Seen as a jab on [[tokenism]] (and sharing his name with [[Lando Calrissian]], the token character from [[Star Wars]]), Lando sporadically appears in two episodes, often just walking across the screen. At the end of the aforementioned episode of his debut, he is about to share some words of wisdom with Dante and Randal when the scene suddenly cuts to Jay and Silent Bob's segment.\n\n===Charles Barkley===\n[[Charles Barkley]] voices a fictionalized version of himself. He appears in the show's ending segments trying to educate the kids. However, Jay and Silent Bob always chase him away. In one episode, he appears as part of a basketball team who make up the jury for a court trial between Jay and Dante.\n\n==''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'' (2001)==\n\n===Marshal Willenholly {{anchor|Marshal|Willenholly}}===\nFederal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly is a character from ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back''. His name comes from ''[[Land of the Lost (1974 TV series)|Land of the Lost's]]'' three main characters Rick Marshal, Will and Holly (in a deleted scene, Willenholly called an FBI agent named Sid N. Marty (played by comedian [[Adam Carolla]]), a reference to [[Sid and Marty Krofft]], who created ''Land of the Lost''). The character was portrayed by [[Will Ferrell]], who would later portray the lead character Rick Marshall in the motion picture adaptation of ''Land of the Lost''.\n\nAfter the film's heroes are framed for a jewel heist, Willenholly arrives to investigate the lesser crime that involved the two in the theft of an orangutan named Susanne from the Provasic animal testing facility. Willenholly, along with a slew of [[Utah]] state police officers (the lead played by [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]] member [[Judd Nelson]]) catch the three at the local Arena diner. When Jay and Bob come out with Susanne (dressed as a child), they claim that \"he\" is their gay love child. Willenholly lets them go, not realizing that the \"kid\" was a monkey until it is to late. Willenholly follows them into the sewers and into the duct of a dam. Susanne manages to trick Willenholly to jump out of the duct and into the water so that she, Jay and Bob can escape.\n\nWillenholly later arrives at the station house, soaked from head to toe. There, he receives information that Jay and Bob are going to Hollywood. He ends up on Miramax studios, searching for the two and has a few near fatal mishaps on the way. When Willenholly finds the two on the set of the [[Bluntman and Chronic]] film, he engages in a shootout with the female gang that actually pulled off the jewel heist. After knocking out the three other members of the gang, the fourth member Justice ([[Shannon Elizabeth]]) gives Willenholly the diamonds, confesses to the heist and asks for a reduced sentence so that she could get off to be with Jay. Willenholly, hoping it will boost his career, agrees. Willenholly and Justice are later seen walking out of the ''Bluntman and Chronic'' film premiere, Willenholly being the only character to say something positive about the film. He is also seen dancing at the [[Morris Day and the Time]] concert.\n\n==''Clerks II'' (2006)==\n\n===Becky Scott {{anchor|Becky Scott}}===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE3\n| name               = Rebecca Hicks n\u00e9e Scott\n| first              = ''[[Clerks (comic)#Where's the Beef?|Where's the Beef?]]'' (2006)\n| last               = ''Clerks II'' (2006)\n| creator            = Kevin Smith\n| portrayer          = [[Rosario Dawson]]\n| nickname           = Becky/Becks\n| occupation         = Mooby's restaurant manager\n| spouse             = Dante Hicks\n| gender             = Female\n| family             = Mr. Scott (father)<br>Mrs. Scott (mother)\n| children           = Unnamed child\n| relatives          = Donald Hicks (father-in-law)<br>Mrs. Hicks (mother-in-law) \n}}\nBecky (nicknamed Becks by Dante Hicks and Randal Graves), played by [[Rosario Dawson]], is a lead female character in ''Clerks II''. She is the manager of the [[Mooby the Golden Calf|Mooby's]] that Dante and Randal work at. Dante does her nails [like he did with Veronica in the first film] during his breaks. Becky does not believe in romantic love, instead deciding that life and relationships are about \"fucking as much as possible\"; accusing society of peddling marriage and families in order to sustain the economy.\n\nDuring the course of the film, she develops a relationship with Dante, as they talk to each other very often in the office. When Dante tells her he does not know how to dance, she offers to teach him some steps on the restaurant's rooftop to the tune of the [[Jackson 5]]'s \"[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]]\". During the dance, she reveals to him that she is pregnant, as they had a [[one night stand]] on a restaurant prep table a few weeks back. At the end of the film, Dante breaks off his engagement with Emma and proposes to Becky at Mooby's. She accepts and helps Dante and Randal reopen the Quick Stop.\n\n===Elias Grover {{anchor|Elias Grover}}===\nElias Grover, portrayed by [[Trevor Fehrman]] is a 19-year-old [[born again Christian]] employee at Mooby's alongside Dante and Randal. Elias is obsessed with both ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[Transformers]]'', and is always subjected to Randal's jokes and abuse. Despite constantly harassing him, Randal insists that after Dante leaves for [[Florida]], Elias will be Randal's new best friend. With the aid of Jay and Silent Bob, Elias gets [[Substance intoxication|high]] during the [[donkey show]] that Randal set up at Mooby's and despite his religious views, Elias is seen [[Masturbation|masturbating]] during the show, apologizing to God the whole time. At the end of the film, he applies for a job at RST Video and becomes a clerk after Dante and Randal reopen the Quick Stop.\n\n===Emma Bunting {{anchor|Emma Bunting}}===\n{{distinguish|Emma Bunton}}\nEmma Bunting appears in a supporting role in ''Clerks II''. (She is played by [[Jennifer Schwalbach Smith]], Kevin Smith's wife.) In the beginning of the film, she is engaged to Dante and both are to drive to Florida the next day to live in a new house and run a car wash. She shows her affection for Dante by wearing a T-shirt that reads \"Mrs. Hicks\". Randal, however, sees Emma as a threat to his friendship with Dante. In the middle of the film, Dante falls for Becky. Emma arrives at the restaurant that night and sees them kissing. Angered by the scene, Emma throws her engagement ring at Becky and a cake at Dante and runs off.\n\nEmma was the typical popular, attractive, rich girl in high school, leading her to a series of disappointing relationships as she dated the popular guys. She eventually learned to seek the \"unconventional\" men for a relationship, leading her to Dante.\n\n===Lance Dowds===\nLance Dowds appears in the film ''Clerks II''. He was portrayed by Jason Lee. He was an arrogant student who was [[Bullying|bullied]] frequently in high school, earning the nickname \"Pickle Fucker\" after taking part in a high school hazing which involved the seniors shoving a pickle up his anus. After graduating, he founded a search engine called MadDucats.com and sold it to [[Amazon.com]] for $20 million, making him an Internet multi-millionaire. He appears in just one scene where he criticizes Dante and Randal, who are still working in dead-end minimum wage jobs, before ordering food from them. In response to Lance's comments, Randal prepares his food by secretly placing dead flies on the hamburger and using ice from a urinal for the drink. Lance, however, gives the meal to Jay before leaving the restaurant. Jay and Silent Bob are seen eating the meal outside, with Jay asking Silent Bob, \"This tastes like piss and flies don't it?\"\n\n===The Sexy Stud===\nThe Sexy Stud appears as a supporting role in ''Clerks II''. He is played by [[Zak Charles Knutson]]. He appears near the end of the film during the [[donkey show]] Randal set up as a celebration for Dante's later canceled plans of moving during Florida. Randal at first believed a woman was going to have sex with the donkey, and also believed that the Sexy Stud was the [[pimp]] (Randal first thought that Kelly was the supposed name of the woman while the donkey was the Sexy Stud). However, the Sexy Stud revealed that the donkey is Kelly while he himself was the Sexy Stud. The Sexy Stud performed sexual acts on the donkey that both appall and fascinate Becky, Dante, Randal, Jay and Silent Bob. But Elias, who watched the show as well, was too drunk to be aware that there was no woman in the show. Along with Dante, Randal, Elias, Jay and Silent Bob, the Sexy Stud is arrested as a result of the show. Even though he gets released from jail along with the others, the Sexy Stud is forced to pay a fine for his actions.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Kevin Smith}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of View Askewniverse Characters}}\n[[Category:View Askew characters|*]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Kevin Smith]]\n", "name_user": "Vokafone", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBrodie Bruce)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_View_Askewniverse_characters"}

This was the first of a series of \"ensemble\" monster films combining characters from several film series. This film, therefore, is both the fifth in [[Frankenstein (Universal film series)|the series of films]] based upon [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', directly after ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'', and a sequel to ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nSome four years after the events of ''The Wolf Man'' and ''The Ghost of Frankenstein'', two men break into the Talbot family crypt to open the grave of [[Larry Talbot]] ([[Lon Chaney, Jr]].), seeking jewelry buried with him, on the night of a full moon. During the robbery, the thieves remove the [[Aconitum|wolfsbane]] buried with Talbot, and he is awakened from death by the full moon shining on his uncovered body. Talbot reflexively grasps the arm of the grave robber with a fur-covered hand, as the other thief flees.\n\nTalbot is found by police in [[Cardiff]] later in the night, with a vicious head wound (administered by his father at the end of ''The Wolf Man''), and taken to a hospital where he is treated by Dr. Mannering ([[Patric Knowles]]). Talbot slowly comes to understand his situation, but during the full moon, he transforms into the Wolf Man and kills a police constable. The next morning, Mannering realizes his patient had been roaming about, and tries to reason with him, though unable to accept Talbot's explanation of his curse. Dr. Mannering allows Inspector Owen ([[Dennis Hoey]]), to question Talbot who becomes violently irate, then is overcome by orderlies and bound to his bed with leather straps. Not believing his story of being a [[werewolf]], the doctor and detective travel to the village of Llanwelly to investigate Talbot and his story. While they are away, Talbot escapes from the hospital, by biting through the restraints with his teeth. Seeking a cure for the curse that causes him to transform into a werewolf with every full moon, Talbot leaves Britain and seeks the gypsy woman Maleva ([[Maria Ouspenskaya]]), who has hearsay knowledge of Dr. Frankenstein ('''Ludwig''' Frankenstein, as the action is returning to the ''Ghost of Frankenstein'' locale) and opines he may able to help Talbot. Together they travel to the village of [[Vasaria]], where Talbot hopes to find the notes of Dr. Frankenstein in the remains of his estate, and permanently end his own life through scientific means. The townsfolk want no part of them or their desire to meet with the deceased Frankenstein and rudely order them to leave.\n\nAn upset Talbot transforms into the Wolf Man and kills a young woman, causing the villagers of Vasaria to raise a mob to chase him down. Fleeing toward the ruins of the Frankenstein castle, Talbot falls through the burned-out flooring and into the frozen cellars below. Talbot recovers from his animal state, and wanders around, discovering [[Frankenstein's Monster]] (ironically portrayed by Lon Chaney Jr. in the preceding film, but actually Bela Lugosi) trapped within an icy chamber; using a stone, Talbot breaks the ice and helps pull the now-revived creature free. Finding that the Monster is unable to locate the notes of the long-dead doctor, Talbot seeks out Baroness Elsa Frankenstein ([[Ilona Massey]]) the daughter of Ludwig, posing as a potential buyer of the estate, hoping she knows their hiding place. She declines to assist Talbot, but the pair are invited to the \"Festival of the New Wine\" by the Burgomeister ([[Lionel Atwill]]).\n\nDuring the festival, a performance of the life-affirming folk song ''Faro-la Faro-Li'' enrages Talbot as Dr. Mannering arrives. The doctor, having followed him across Europe, converses with Talbot to persuade him to return to Wales before he has another spell. Talbot refuses to go with Mannering, and the Monster crashes the festival. With the Monster revealed, Elsa and Mannering agree to help the villagers rid themselves of the Frankenstein curse forever. The following morning, the couple, with Maleva in tow, meet with Talbot and the Monster at the ruins. Mannering is instantly fascinated by the Monster scientifically, and the Baroness gives the notes to Talbot and the doctor. Mannering studies the notes and learns how to drain all life from both Talbot and the Monster, believing the laboratory can be repaired for the task.\n\nIn the meantime, the villagers are dismayed to see crates of instruments arriving for Dr. Mannering to enable the experiment and become restless, knowing nothing of the doings at the ruins. Vazec, the innkeeper details a plan to destroy the dam overlooking the old estate with dynamite and drown all within, ending their troubles in one blow. The Burgomeister dismisses the idea as nothing but a drunken notion, but Vazec is determined and puts his plan into action.\n\nUnfortunately, Dr. Mannering's scientific curiosity to see the Monster at full strength overwhelms his logic, and to Elsa's horror he decides to fully revive it. The experiment coincides on the night of a full moon, and Talbot transforms yet again as the Monster regains his strength (and eyesight); both escape their restraints.\n\nThe Monster begins to carry Elsa away, but the Wolf Man attacks him, and she escapes from the castle with Mannering. The Wolf Man and the Monster then engage in a fight until they are both swept away in the flood that results when Vazec dynamites the dam.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] as [[Larry Talbot|Lawrence \"Larry\" Talbot / The Wolf Man]]\n* [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Frankenstein's Monster]]\n* [[Ilona Massey]] as Baroness Elsa Frankenstein\n* [[Patric Knowles]] as Dr. Mannering\n* [[Lionel Atwill]] as Mayor\n* [[Maria Ouspenskaya]] as Maleva\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n* [[Dennis Hoey]] as Inspector Owen\n* [[Don Barclay (actor)|Don Barclay]] as Franzec\n* [[Rex Evans]] as Vazec\n* [[Dwight Frye]] as Rudi\n* [[Harry Stubbs (actor)|Harry Stubbs]] as Guno\n* [[Doris Lloyd]] as Dr. Mannering's Nurse \n{{col-end}}\n\n==Structure==\nAs ultimately edited and released, ''Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man'' is told in two almost equal parts.  The opening scenes tell the story of Talbot's resurrection, killing spree, hospitalization, and escape across Europe.  Much time is spent with a secondary policeman, Inspector Owen, and on scenes with a desperate Talbot hospitalized by Dr. Mannering.  The discovery of the Monster and pursuit of Dr. Frankenstein's scientific notes do not begin until thirty-five minutes into the film.  The second half introduces the Monster, Elsa, and the village of Vasaria and its inhabitants.\n\n==Production==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 250\n   | footer    = Colorized publicity shots from the movie.\n   | image1    = FrankensteinMeetsTheWolfManCrop.png\n   | image2    = FrankensteinMeetsWolfmanCrop002.png\n   | image3    = FrankensteinMeetsWolfmanCrop004.png\n   | image4    = FrankensteinMeetsWolfmanCrop003.png\n}}\nScreenwriter [[Curt Siodmak]] claimed that during a lunch in the studio commissary he had joked to producer [[George Waggner]] that he had a great title for a new film in the series (half-heartedly \u2014 he needed a down payment for a new car): \"''Frankenstein Wolfs The Meat Man''\". Waggner, not known for a casual sense of humor, left to have his lunch; shortly thereafter, he called Siodmak to his office, telling him to \"go ahead, buy the car.\" Dumbfounded but pleased, the writer went to work; thus that next film was ''Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man'', which served as a [[sequel]] both to ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' and ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]''.\n\nImmediately following his success in ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'', [[Bela Lugosi]] had been the first choice to play the Monster in Universal's original ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' film, but Lugosi famously turned down the nonspeaking, heavily made-up role: as conceived by the original director [[Robert Florey]], the Monster was nothing more than a mindless killing machine and not suitable for Lugosi's rising stardom and career as a leading actor. After the change of directors to [[James Whale]], along with a major script and conceptual revision, the virtually unknown [[Boris Karloff]] was then cast in his star-making role. (Florey later wrote that \"the Hungarian actor didn't show himself very enthusiastic for the role and didn't want to play it.\") Eight years later, Lugosi joined the film as the Monster's twisted companion Ygor in ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]''. He returned to the role in the sequel, ''The Ghost of Frankenstein'', in which Ygor's brain is implanted into the Monster (now Chaney), causing the creature to take on Lugosi/Ygor's voice. After plans for Chaney to play both the Monster and the Wolf Man in the next film fell through for logistical reasons, the natural next step was for Lugosi, who turned 60 during the film's production, to take on the part that he once was slated to originate.\n\nThe original script \u2014 and indeed the film as originally filmed \u2014 had the Monster performing dialogue throughout the film, including references to the events of ''Ghost'' and indicating that the Monster is now blind (a side effect of the brain transplant as revealed at the end of the previous film, and the reason for his iconic stiff-armed \"Frankenstein walk\"). According to Siodmak, a studio screening audience reacted negatively to this, finding the idea of the Monster speaking with a Hungarian accent unintentionally funny (although the Monster spoke with Lugosi's voice at the end of ''Ghost'', the audiences had been carefully prepared for it by the plot of the film). This has been generally accepted as the reason virtually all scenes in which Lugosi speaks were deleted (though two brief scenes remain in the film that show Lugosi's mouth moving without sound). All references to his being blind were also eliminated, rendering the Monster's groping gestures unmotivated for those unfamiliar with the ending of the previous film. Close-ups of Lugosi's eyes during the revitalization scene and his evil, knowing leer to Patric Knowles were supposed to indicate that his vision had been restored, but in the ultimate context of the film this means nothing. Consequently, Lugosi is onscreen literally for only a few minutes, leaving the Wolf Man as the film's primary focus.\n\nLugosi suffered exhaustion at some point during the filming, and his absence from the set, combined with his physical limitations at age 60, required the liberal use of stand-ins. Stuntman [[Gil Perkins]] allegedly portrayed the Monster in the character's first scene (thirty-five minutes into the film) and during much of the monsters' fight (conclusive documentation needed). Although a still exists of Lugosi in the ice, when viewers see the Monster for the first time (including closeups), it is actually the stunt double Perkins. Stuntman [[Eddie Parker (actor)|Eddie Parker]] is usually credited as Lugosi's sole double, but his primary stunt role was thought to be that of the Wolf Man. However, he does appear as the Monster in at least one shot, and yet a possible third stuntman also stands in for Lugosi in two brief sequences. The edited result unfairly suggests that Lugosi had to be doubled even in non-strenuous scenes, and the multiple use of alternating stuntmen in both closeups and medium shots damages the continuity of Lugosi's characterization. As an example, the doubles in the fight scene stiffen their arms, even though that was a cautious habit of the previously-blind Monster; for instance, a medium shot shows Lugosi pulling down a cabinet with his arms naturally bent at the elbows, but the next shot is of a double completing the task with straightened arms.\n\nThis would be the final Universal horror film in which the Monster played a major role; in the subsequent films ''[[The House of Frankenstein (film)|The House of Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[House of Dracula]]'', the Monster, played by [[Glenn Strange]], is brought back to life only in the final scenes (in the 1948 Universal comedy ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (the second and final film in which Lugosi plays Dracula), Strange has a larger role and the creature once again speaks, albeit with very limited dialogue, twice muttering, \"Yes, Master.\"). It was also the last Universal horror film to feature an actual member of the Frankenstein family as a character.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It was also the final Universal Monster film to feature recurring actor [[Dwight Frye]], who died later the same year.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:MadMonsterNo5.png|thumb|150px|<small>1961 magazine cover depicting the climactic battle between Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolf Man</small>.]][[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"a great disappointment\" because he thought that the fight between the two monsters came as too little, too late. \"Too bad.

This was the first of a series of \"ensemble\" monster films combining characters from several film series. This film, therefore, is both the fifth in the series of films based upon [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', directly after ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'', and a sequel to ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nSome four years after the events of ''The Wolf Man'' and ''The Ghost of Frankenstein'', two men break into the Talbot family crypt to open the grave of [[Larry Talbot]] ([[Lon Chaney, Jr]].), seeking jewelry buried with him, on the night of a full moon. During the robbery, the thieves remove the [[Aconitum|wolfsbane]] buried with Talbot, and he is awakened from death by the full moon shining on his uncovered body. Talbot reflexively grasps the arm of the grave robber with a fur-covered hand, as the other thief flees.\n\nTalbot is found by police in [[Cardiff]] later in the night, with a vicious head wound (administered by his father at the end of ''The Wolf Man''), and taken to a hospital where he is treated by Dr. Mannering ([[Patric Knowles]]). Talbot slowly comes to understand his situation, but during the full moon, he transforms into the Wolf Man and kills a police constable. The next morning, Mannering realizes his patient had been roaming about, and tries to reason with him, though unable to accept Talbot's explanation of his curse. Dr. Mannering allows Inspector Owen ([[Dennis Hoey]]), to question Talbot who becomes violently irate, then is overcome by orderlies and bound to his bed with leather straps. Not believing his story of being a [[werewolf]], the doctor and detective travel to the village of Llanwelly to investigate Talbot and his story. While they are away, Talbot escapes from the hospital, by biting through the restraints with his teeth. Seeking a cure for the curse that causes him to transform into a werewolf with every full moon, Talbot leaves Britain and seeks the gypsy woman Maleva ([[Maria Ouspenskaya]]), who has hearsay knowledge of Dr. Frankenstein ('''Ludwig''' Frankenstein, as the action is returning to the ''Ghost of Frankenstein'' locale) and opines he may able to help Talbot. Together they travel to the village of [[Vasaria]], where Talbot hopes to find the notes of Dr. Frankenstein in the remains of his estate, and permanently end his own life through scientific means. The townsfolk want no part of them or their desire to meet with the deceased Frankenstein and rudely order them to leave.\n\nAn upset Talbot transforms into the Wolf Man and kills a young woman, causing the villagers of Vasaria to raise a mob to chase him down. Fleeing toward the ruins of the Frankenstein castle, Talbot falls through the burned-out flooring and into the frozen cellars below. Talbot recovers from his animal state, and wanders around, discovering [[Frankenstein's Monster]] (ironically portrayed by Lon Chaney Jr. in the preceding film, but actually Bela Lugosi) trapped within an icy chamber; using a stone, Talbot breaks the ice and helps pull the now-revived creature free. Finding that the Monster is unable to locate the notes of the long-dead doctor, Talbot seeks out Baroness Elsa Frankenstein ([[Ilona Massey]]) the daughter of Ludwig, posing as a potential buyer of the estate, hoping she knows their hiding place. She declines to assist Talbot, but the pair are invited to the \"Festival of the New Wine\" by the Burgomeister ([[Lionel Atwill]]).\n\nDuring the festival, a performance of the life-affirming folk song ''Faro-la Faro-Li'' enrages Talbot as Dr. Mannering arrives. The doctor, having followed him across Europe, converses with Talbot to persuade him to return to Wales before he has another spell. Talbot refuses to go with Mannering, and the Monster crashes the festival. With the Monster revealed, Elsa and Mannering agree to help the villagers rid themselves of the Frankenstein curse forever. The following morning, the couple, with Maleva in tow, meet with Talbot and the Monster at the ruins. Mannering is instantly fascinated by the Monster scientifically, and the Baroness gives the notes to Talbot and the doctor. Mannering studies the notes and learns how to drain all life from both Talbot and the Monster, believing the laboratory can be repaired for the task.\n\nIn the meantime, the villagers are dismayed to see crates of instruments arriving for Dr. Mannering to enable the experiment and become restless, knowing nothing of the doings at the ruins. Vazec, the innkeeper details a plan to destroy the dam overlooking the old estate with dynamite and drown all within, ending their troubles in one blow. The Burgomeister dismisses the idea as nothing but a drunken notion, but Vazec is determined and puts his plan into action.\n\nUnfortunately, Dr. Mannering's scientific curiosity to see the Monster at full strength overwhelms his logic, and to Elsa's horror he decides to fully revive it. The experiment coincides on the night of a full moon, and Talbot transforms yet again as the Monster regains his strength (and eyesight); both escape their restraints.\n\nThe Monster begins to carry Elsa away, but the Wolf Man attacks him, and she escapes from the castle with Mannering. The Wolf Man and the Monster then engage in a fight until they are both swept away in the flood that results when Vazec dynamites the dam.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] as [[Larry Talbot|Lawrence \"Larry\" Talbot / The Wolf Man]]\n* [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Frankenstein's Monster]]\n* [[Ilona Massey]] as Baroness Elsa Frankenstein\n* [[Patric Knowles]] as Dr. Mannering\n* [[Lionel Atwill]] as Mayor\n* [[Maria Ouspenskaya]] as Maleva\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n* [[Dennis Hoey]] as Inspector Owen\n* [[Don Barclay (actor)|Don Barclay]] as Franzec\n* [[Rex Evans]] as Vazec\n* [[Dwight Frye]] as Rudi\n* [[Harry Stubbs (actor)|Harry Stubbs]] as Guno\n* [[Doris Lloyd]] as Dr. Mannering's Nurse \n{{col-end}}\n\n==Structure==\nAs ultimately edited and released, ''Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man'' is told in two almost equal parts.  The opening scenes tell the story of Talbot's resurrection, killing spree, hospitalization, and escape across Europe.  Much time is spent with a secondary policeman, Inspector Owen, and on scenes with a desperate Talbot hospitalized by Dr. Mannering.  The discovery of the Monster and pursuit of Dr. Frankenstein's scientific notes do not begin until thirty-five minutes into the film.  The second half introduces the Monster, Elsa, and the village of Vasaria and its inhabitants.\n\n==Production==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 250\n   | footer    = Colorized publicity shots from the movie.\n   | image1    = FrankensteinMeetsTheWolfManCrop.png\n   | image2    = FrankensteinMeetsWolfmanCrop002.png\n   | image3    = FrankensteinMeetsWolfmanCrop004.png\n   | image4    = FrankensteinMeetsWolfmanCrop003.png\n}}\nScreenwriter [[Curt Siodmak]] claimed that during a lunch in the studio commissary he had joked to producer [[George Waggner]] that he had a great title for a new film in the series (half-heartedly \u2014 he needed a down payment for a new car): \"''Frankenstein Wolfs The Meat Man''\". Waggner, not known for a casual sense of humor, left to have his lunch; shortly thereafter, he called Siodmak to his office, telling him to \"go ahead, buy the car.\" Dumbfounded but pleased, the writer went to work; thus that next film was ''Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man'', which served as a [[sequel]] both to ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' and ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]''.\n\nImmediately following his success in ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'', [[Bela Lugosi]] had been the first choice to play the Monster in Universal's original ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' film, but Lugosi famously turned down the nonspeaking, heavily made-up role: as conceived by the original director [[Robert Florey]], the Monster was nothing more than a mindless killing machine and not suitable for Lugosi's rising stardom and career as a leading actor. After the change of directors to [[James Whale]], along with a major script and conceptual revision, the virtually unknown [[Boris Karloff]] was then cast in his star-making role. (Florey later wrote that \"the Hungarian actor didn't show himself very enthusiastic for the role and didn't want to play it.\") Eight years later, Lugosi joined the film as the Monster's twisted companion Ygor in ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]''. He returned to the role in the sequel, ''The Ghost of Frankenstein'', in which Ygor's brain is implanted into the Monster (now Chaney), causing the creature to take on Lugosi/Ygor's voice. After plans for Chaney to play both the Monster and the Wolf Man in the next film fell through for logistical reasons, the natural next step was for Lugosi, who turned 60 during the film's production, to take on the part that he once was slated to originate.\n\nThe original script \u2014 and indeed the film as originally filmed \u2014 had the Monster performing dialogue throughout the film, including references to the events of ''Ghost'' and indicating that the Monster is now blind (a side effect of the brain transplant as revealed at the end of the previous film, and the reason for his iconic stiff-armed \"Frankenstein walk\"). According to Siodmak, a studio screening audience reacted negatively to this, finding the idea of the Monster speaking with a Hungarian accent unintentionally funny (although the Monster spoke with Lugosi's voice at the end of ''Ghost'', the audiences had been carefully prepared for it by the plot of the film). This has been generally accepted as the reason virtually all scenes in which Lugosi speaks were deleted (though two brief scenes remain in the film that show Lugosi's mouth moving without sound). All references to his being blind were also eliminated, rendering the Monster's groping gestures unmotivated for those unfamiliar with the ending of the previous film. Close-ups of Lugosi's eyes during the revitalization scene and his evil, knowing leer to Patric Knowles were supposed to indicate that his vision had been restored, but in the ultimate context of the film this means nothing. Consequently, Lugosi is onscreen literally for only a few minutes, leaving the Wolf Man as the film's primary focus.\n\nLugosi suffered exhaustion at some point during the filming, and his absence from the set, combined with his physical limitations at age 60, required the liberal use of stand-ins. Stuntman [[Gil Perkins]] allegedly portrayed the Monster in the character's first scene (thirty-five minutes into the film) and during much of the monsters' fight (conclusive documentation needed). Although a still exists of Lugosi in the ice, when viewers see the Monster for the first time (including closeups), it is actually the stunt double Perkins. Stuntman [[Eddie Parker (actor)|Eddie Parker]] is usually credited as Lugosi's sole double, but his primary stunt role was thought to be that of the Wolf Man. However, he does appear as the Monster in at least one shot, and yet a possible third stuntman also stands in for Lugosi in two brief sequences. The edited result unfairly suggests that Lugosi had to be doubled even in non-strenuous scenes, and the multiple use of alternating stuntmen in both closeups and medium shots damages the continuity of Lugosi's characterization. As an example, the doubles in the fight scene stiffen their arms, even though that was a cautious habit of the previously-blind Monster; for instance, a medium shot shows Lugosi pulling down a cabinet with his arms naturally bent at the elbows, but the next shot is of a double completing the task with straightened arms.\n\nThis would be the final Universal horror film in which the Monster played a major role; in the subsequent films ''[[The House of Frankenstein (film)|The House of Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[House of Dracula]]'', the Monster, played by [[Glenn Strange]], is brought back to life only in the final scenes (in the 1948 Universal comedy ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (the second and final film in which Lugosi plays Dracula), Strange has a larger role and the creature once again speaks, albeit with very limited dialogue, twice muttering, \"Yes, Master.\"). It was also the last Universal horror film to feature an actual member of the Frankenstein family as a character.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It was also the final Universal Monster film to feature recurring actor [[Dwight Frye]], who died later the same year.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:MadMonsterNo5.png|thumb|150px|<small>1961 magazine cover depicting the climactic battle between Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolf Man</small>.]][[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"a great disappointment\" because he thought that the fight between the two monsters came as too little, too late. \"Too bad.
