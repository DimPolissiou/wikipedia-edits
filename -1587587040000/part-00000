He became the most popular and famous character in the series, and is the titular protagonist in the accompanying television spin-off series ''[[Thomas & Friends]]''.\n\nThomas is a steam engine and has a number 1 painted on his side.

Thomas was used initially as a station pilot engine in the first three stories in book 2, but longed for more important jobs such as pulling the express train like Gordon; his inexperience prevented this. In the fourth story, ''Thomas and the Breakdown Train'', Thomas rescues James and is rewarded with his own [[branch line]].<ref>Awdry (2005), 35</ref> He has remained in charge of the Ffarquhar branch ever since, with his two coaches [[Annie and Clarabel]], and help from [[Percy the Small Engine|Percy]] and [[Toby the Tram Engine|Toby]]. Thomas is generally depicted with a cheeky and even self-important personality. He believes that he should be more respected by the others, and he gets annoyed when he does not receive this respect. However, Percy and Toby are more than capable of standing up to him, and Annie and Clarabel often rebuke him.\n\n==TV series==\n{{Main|Thomas & Friends}}\n\nThomas's on-screen appearances in the TV series were developed by [[Britt Allcroft]]. The first series of 26 stories premiered in October 1984 on the ITV Network in the UK, with former [[Beatles]] drummer/vocalist [[Ringo Starr]] as storyteller. The stories were featured as segments as part of [[Shining Time Station]] in the US beginning in 1989 with Starr as the show's Mr. Conductor character. From 1991 to 1993, [[George Carlin]] replaced Starr as both the storyteller and as Mr. Conductor for Shining Time Station. Carlin also told the Thomas stories for Shining Time Station in 1995.\n\nIn 1996 the Thomas stories were segments for ''[[Mr. Conductor's Thomas Tales]]'', again featuring George Carlin. [[Alec Baldwin]] portrayed Mr. Conductor in ''[[Thomas and the Magic Railroad]]'', and narrated the series for the US from 1998 to 2003. [[Michael Angelis]] narrated the series from 1991 to 2012 in the UK, while [[Michael Brandon]] narrated the series from 2004 to 2012 in the US. From 2013 to 2017, the series was narrated by [[Mark Moraghan]] until the franchise's reboot in 2018, when the episodes were told from Thomas's point of view.\n\nThomas's personality was originally faithful to the character of the books. As the show branched away from the novels however, modifications were made. Thomas became noticeably less arrogant and self-absorbed, developing a more friendly, altruistic and happy go lucky (if still rather over-excitable) side. He also no longer appears to be limited to his branch line and seems to work all over Sodor. These changes in his personality and duties are a result of his \"star\" status. He is the most popular character in the series, and therefore he has the largest number of appearances, appearing in all of the DVD specials and the movie [[Thomas & the Magic Railroad]].\n\nFrom [[Hero of the Rails]] until Series 18, Thomas was voiced by [[Martin Sherman (actor)|Martin Sherman]] (US) and [[Ben Small]] (UK).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Thomas the Tank Engine speaks for the first time|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/742521-thomas-the-tank-engine-speaks-for-the-first-time|work=Metro|accessdate=31 May 2010|date=24 September 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vhg8AQgv|archivedate=13 January 2011}}</ref> From 2015 onwards, Thomas is voiced by [[John Hasler]] in the UK, and by [[Joseph May]] in the US.\n\nIn [[Thomas & Friends: The Adventure Begins|The Adventure Begins]] which is a retelling of Thomas's early days on Sodor, he is a bluish-green colour when he first arrives on Sodor, his tanks are lettered \"LBSC\" (for the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway) with the number 70 on his bunker.  The 70 is a reference to 2015 being the 70th anniversary for the Railway Series, while the [[LB&SCR E2 class]] were actually numbered from 100\u2013109.  The real life LBSC no. 70 is an [[LB&SCR A1 class|A1 class]].\n\n===Voice actors===\n* [[Edward Glen]] (''[[Thomas and the Magic Railroad]]'')\n* [[John Bellis]] (''Thomas and the Magic Railroad (original work-prints only)'') \n* [[Ringo Starr]] (''[[The Official BBC Children in Need Medley]]'')\n* [[Ben Small]] (''UK ([[Hero of the Rails]] \u2013 Season 18)'')\n* [[John Hasler]] (''UK ([[Thomas & Friends: The Adventure Begins]] onwards)'')\n* [[Martin Sherman (actor)|Martin Sherman]] (''US (Hero of the Rails \u2013 Season 18)'')\n* [[Joseph May]] (''US ([[Thomas & Friends: The Adventure Begins]] onwards)'')\n* [[Keiko Toda]] (''Japan (Season 1 \u2013 8)'')\n* [[Kumiko Higa]] (''Japan ([[Calling All Engines!]] onwards)'')\n* Joel Beckford (''UK (scripts only)'')\n* Keira Jones (''US (scripts only)'')\n* Shin Yong-Woo (Korea (Season 18 and 19))\n\n==Models==\nThomas had his genesis, like [[Winnie-the-Pooh]], in a toy for a small child, both coincidentally named Christopher. A wooden push-along toy from the early 1940s is the original Thomas made by the Reverend Awdry out of a piece of broomstick for his son Christopher. This engine looked rather different from the character in the books and television series and was based on an [[GNR Class J23|LNER Class J50]] with smaller side tanks and splashers.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} He was painted blue with yellow lining and carried the letters NW on his side tanks.\n\nChristopher Awdry lost this model when he was in the US, although it was recreated for the 70th Anniversary. However, the Reverend was happy to endorse Payne's account that the locomotive was an [[LB&SCR E2 class|LBSC E2]], although the first Thomas on the Awdry's model railway, from Stuart Reidpath, lacked extended tanks. In the 1979 Thomas Annual, Awdry wrote:\n\n\"I bought Thomas in 1948 when I was writing \"Tank Engine Thomas Again\", and wanted to start modelling once more after a lapse of some twenty years. Thomas was one of Stewart Reidpath's standard models with a heavy, cast white metal body, and was fitted with his \"Essar\" chassis and motor. Stewart Reidpath is now dead, and his motors, let alone spare parts for them, have been unobtainable for years; but Thomas still keeps going! He is, as you might expect from his age, a temperamental old gentleman, and has to be driven very carefully indeed.\"\n\nThomas Mk1 was retired with its coaches in 1979, Thomas Mk2 having been produced the year before using a Tri-ang 'Jinty' 3F 0-6-0T. \nAfter Hornby produced the LBSC E2 tank, Awdry gladly adapted one in 1980 to take the role of Thomas Mk3 on his layout, the Ffarquhar branch.\n\nAwdry's requested models, to which Lines Bros. subsidiary, Meccano Ltd, responded with Percy and wagons in 1967.  Hornby Hobbies launched their 'The World of Thomas the Tank Engine' in the 1985.  This was a 00 gauge range of model railway train sets and models which they made for the next 30 years.  For Thomas they used their 1979 model of a LB&SCR model of a Class E2 tank engine which they suitably altered with a face and extended tanks to look like Thomas.  Many of the characters in the 'Railway Series' books were thus modelled (with faces) by Hornby, including characters added for the television series.  They also supplied suitable coaches, wagons and lineside buildings within the series.\n\n==Awards==\nThomas was the only fictional character included in the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'s'' 2009 \"[[Happy List]]\", recognised alongside 98 real-life adults and a [[therapy dog]] for making Britain a better and happier place.<ref name=list2009>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-iiosi-happy-list-2009--the-100-1671055.html|title=The IoS Happy List 2009 \u2013 the 100|date=18 April 2009|work=The Independent}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:JNR C11 227 20140824 001.jpg|thumb|300px|A ''Thomas the Tank Engine'' themed [[JNR Class C11]] train in Japan, 2014.]]\n\nThomas has been referenced, featured and parodied in popular culture. In 1988, he was parodied on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Spitting Image]]'' where he was portrayed as a drunk who went \"completely off the rails.\"<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzJfWm5ZZI|title=Ringo/Thomas Spoof on Spitting Image (1988)|date=25 January 2011|via=YouTube}}</ref> In 2009, he appeared in [[The Official BBC Children in Need Medley]] where he was voiced by [[Ringo Starr]], who narrated the first two series of ''Thomas and Friends''. In the British comedy show ''Bobby Davro's TV Weekly'', a spoof was created titled \"Thomas The Tanked Up Engine\" involving Jeremy, the pink engine. [[Bobby Davro]] provided the narration by impersonating [[Ringo Starr]].<!-- Checked vs clip on YouTube - eg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCNUDwHW1k&feature=feedf -->\n\nIn Cartoon Network's ''[[Mad (TV series)|MAD]]'', Thomas the Tank Engine appears in \"Thomas the Unstoppable Tank Engine,\" a crossover between ''Thomas the Tank Engine'' and ''[[Unstoppable (2010 film)|Unstoppable]]''.<ref>{{cite AV media |people= |date= 2 October 2011|title= Skit From MadTV: Thomas The Unstoppable Tank Engine|trans-title= |medium= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YxldNG02vw|access-date= 21 June 2018|format= YouTube|time= |publisher= Ryan21hw}}</ref> A parody of Thomas the Tank Engine was in ''[[Robot Chicken]]''.

In the film's climactic battle, [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ant-Man]] and [[Darren Cross|Yellowjacket]] fight atop Thomas while in their insect sizes until Yellowjacket derails Thomas off the model train tracks and throws him onto a windowsill. An accident during the fight results in Thomas suddenly growing to the size of a real train and demolishing a large portion of [[Cassandra Lang|Ant-Man's daughter's]] house before falling on top of a police car.\n\nVideo game players have frequently [[mod (video gaming)|modified]] released games to include Thomas and other characters, typically by replacing a [[boss (video game)|boss]] character with Thomas and using sounds and music from the show. One of the first popular efforts was replacing dragons with engines and trucks in the game ''[[The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim]]'' in 2013, and Thomas has since been incorporated into other games like ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' and the 2019 Resident Evil 2 [[Resident Evil 2 (2019 video game)|remake]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://theface.com/culture/why-are-people-modding-thomas-the-tank-engine-into-video-games | title = Why are people modding Thomas the Tank Engine into video games? | first = Edwin | last = Evans-Thirlwell | date = 9 May 2019 | accessdate = 15 May 2019 | work = [[The Face (magazine)|The Face]] }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Little Engine That Could]]''\n{{Portal|United Kingdom}}\n\n== Note ==\n*Awdry, Christopher (2005).

The stories were featured as segments as part of [[Shining Time Station]] in the US beginning in 1989 with Starr as the show's Mr. Conductor character. From 1991 to 1993, [[George Carlin]] replaced Starr as both the storyteller and as Mr. Conductor for Shining Time Station. Carlin also told the Thomas stories for Shining Time Station in 1995.\n\nIn 1996 the Thomas stories were segments for ''[[Mr. Conductor's Thomas Tales]]'', again featuring George Carlin. [[Alec Baldwin]] portrayed Mr. Conductor in ''[[Thomas and the Magic Railroad]]'', and narrated the series for the US from 1998 to 2003. [[Michael Angelis]] narrated the series from 1991 to 2012 in the UK, while [[Michael Brandon]] narrated the series from 2004 to 2012 in the US. From 2013 to 2017, the series was narrated by [[Mark Moraghan]] until the franchise's reboot in 2018, when the episodes were told from Thomas's point of view.\n\nThomas's personality was originally faithful to the character of the books. As the show branched away from the novels however, modifications were made. Thomas became noticeably less arrogant and self-absorbed, developing a more friendly, altruistic and happy go lucky (if still rather over-excitable) side. He also no longer appears to be limited to his branch line and seems to work all over Sodor. These changes in his personality and duties are a result of his \"star\" status. He is the most popular character in the series, and therefore he has the largest number of appearances, appearing in all of the DVD specials and the movie [[Thomas & the Magic Railroad]].\n\nFrom [[Hero of the Rails]] until Series 18, Thomas was voiced by [[Martin Sherman (actor)|Martin Sherman]] (US) and [[Ben Small]] (UK).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Thomas the Tank Engine speaks for the first time|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/742521-thomas-the-tank-engine-speaks-for-the-first-time|work=Metro|accessdate=31 May 2010|date=24 September 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vhg8AQgv|archivedate=13 January 2011}}</ref> From 2015 onwards, Thomas is voiced by [[John Hasler]] in the UK, and by [[Joseph May]] in the US.\n\nIn [[Thomas & Friends: The Adventure Begins|The Adventure Begins]] which is a retelling of Thomas's early days on Sodor, he is a bluish-green colour when he first arrives on Sodor, his tanks are lettered \"LBSC\" (for the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway) with the number 70 on his bunker.  The 70 is a reference to 2015 being the 70th anniversary for the Railway Series, while the [[LB&SCR E2 class]] were actually numbered from 100\u2013109.  The real life LBSC no. 70 is an [[LB&SCR A1 class|A1 class]].\n\n===Voice actors===\n* [[Edward Glen]] (''[[Thomas and the Magic Railroad]]'')\n* [[John Bellis]] (''Thomas and the Magic Railroad (original work-prints only)'') \n* [[Ringo Starr]] (''[[The Official BBC Children in Need Medley]]'')\n* [[Ben Small]] (''UK ([[Hero of the Rails]] \u2013 Season 18)'')\n* [[John Hasler]] (''UK ([[Thomas & Friends: The Adventure Begins]] onwards)'')\n* [[Martin Sherman (actor)|Martin Sherman]] (''US (Hero of the Rails \u2013 Season 18)'')\n* [[Joseph May]] (''US ([[Thomas & Friends: The Adventure Begins]] onwards)'')\n* [[Keiko Toda]] (''Japan (Season 1 \u2013 8)'')\n* [[Kumiko Higa]] (''Japan ([[Calling All Engines!]] onwards)'')\n* Joel Beckford (''UK (scripts only)'')\n* Keira Jones (''US (scripts only)'')\n* Shin Yong-Woo (Korea (Season 18 and 19))\n\n==Models==\nThomas had his genesis, like [[Winnie-the-Pooh]], in a toy for a small child, both coincidentally named Christopher. A wooden push-along toy from the early 1940s is the original Thomas made by the Reverend Awdry out of a piece of broomstick for his son Christopher. This engine looked rather different from the character in the books and television series and was based on an [[GNR Class J23|LNER Class J50]] with smaller side tanks and splashers.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} He was painted blue with yellow lining and carried the letters NW on his side tanks.\n\nChristopher Awdry lost this model when he was in the US, although it was recreated for the 70th Anniversary. However, the Reverend was happy to endorse Payne's account that the locomotive was an [[LB&SCR E2 class|LBSC E2]], although the first Thomas on the Awdry's model railway, from Stuart Reidpath, lacked extended tanks. In the 1979 Thomas Annual, Awdry wrote:\n\n\"I bought Thomas in 1948 when I was writing \"Tank Engine Thomas Again\", and wanted to start modelling once more after a lapse of some twenty years. Thomas was one of Stewart Reidpath's standard models with a heavy, cast white metal body, and was fitted with his \"Essar\" chassis and motor. Stewart Reidpath is now dead, and his motors, let alone spare parts for them, have been unobtainable for years; but Thomas still keeps going! He is, as you might expect from his age, a temperamental old gentleman, and has to be driven very carefully indeed.\"\n\nThomas Mk1 was retired with its coaches in 1979, Thomas Mk2 having been produced the year before using a Tri-ang 'Jinty' 3F 0-6-0T. \nAfter Hornby produced the LBSC E2 tank, Awdry gladly adapted one in 1980 to take the role of Thomas Mk3 on his layout, the Ffarquhar branch.\n\nAwdry's requested models, to which Lines Bros. subsidiary, Meccano Ltd, responded with Percy and wagons in 1967.  Hornby Hobbies launched their 'The World of Thomas the Tank Engine' in the 1985.  This was a 00 gauge range of model railway train sets and models which they made for the next 30 years.  For Thomas they used their 1979 model of a LB&SCR model of a Class E2 tank engine which they suitably altered with a face and extended tanks to look like Thomas.  Many of the characters in the 'Railway Series' books were thus modelled (with faces) by Hornby, including characters added for the television series.  They also supplied suitable coaches, wagons and lineside buildings within the series.\n\n==Awards==\nThomas was the only fictional character included in the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'s'' 2009 \"[[Happy List]]\", recognised alongside 98 real-life adults and a [[therapy dog]] for making Britain a better and happier place.<ref name=list2009>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-iiosi-happy-list-2009--the-100-1671055.html|title=The IoS Happy List 2009 \u2013 the 100|date=18 April 2009|work=The Independent}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:JNR C11 227 20140824 001.jpg|thumb|300px|A ''Thomas the Tank Engine'' themed [[JNR Class C11]] train in Japan, 2014.]]\n\nThomas has been referenced, featured and parodied in popular culture. In 1988, he was parodied on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Spitting Image]]'' where he was portrayed as a drunk who went \"completely off the rails.\"<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzJfWm5ZZI|title=Ringo/Thomas Spoof on Spitting Image (1988)|date=25 January 2011|via=YouTube}}</ref> In 2009, he appeared in [[The Official BBC Children in Need Medley]] where he was voiced by [[Ringo Starr]], who narrated the first two series of ''Thomas and Friends''. In the British comedy show ''Bobby Davro's TV Weekly'', a spoof was created titled \"Thomas The Tanked Up Engine\" involving Jeremy, the pink engine. [[Bobby Davro]] provided the narration by impersonating [[Ringo Starr]].<!-- Checked vs clip on YouTube - eg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCNUDwHW1k&feature=feedf -->\n\nIn Cartoon Network's ''[[Mad (TV series)|MAD]]'', Thomas the Tank Engine appears in \"Thomas the Unstoppable Tank Engine,\" a crossover between ''Thomas the Tank Engine'' and ''[[Unstoppable (2010 film)|Unstoppable]]''.<ref>{{cite AV media |people= |date= 2 October 2011|title= Skit From MadTV: Thomas The Unstoppable Tank Engine|trans-title= |medium= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YxldNG02vw|access-date= 21 June 2018|format= YouTube|time= |publisher= Ryan21hw}}</ref> A parody of Thomas the Tank Engine was in ''[[Robot Chicken]]''.

In the film's climactic battle, [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ant-Man]] and [[Darren Cross|Yellowjacket]] fight atop Thomas while in their insect sizes until Yellowjacket derails Thomas off the model train tracks and throws him onto a windowsill. An accident during the fight results in Thomas suddenly growing to the size of a real train and demolishing a large portion of [[Cassandra Lang|Ant-Man's daughter's]] house before falling on top of a police car.\n\nVideo game players have frequently [[mod (video gaming)|modified]] released games to include Thomas and other characters, typically by replacing a [[boss (video game)|boss]] character with Thomas and using sounds and music from the show. One of the first popular efforts was replacing dragons with engines and trucks in the game ''[[The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim]]'' in 2013, and Thomas has since been incorporated into other games like ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' and the 2019 Resident Evil 2 [[Resident Evil 2 (2019 video game)|remake]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://theface.com/culture/why-are-people-modding-thomas-the-tank-engine-into-video-games | title = Why are people modding Thomas the Tank Engine into video games? | first = Edwin | last = Evans-Thirlwell | date = 9 May 2019 | accessdate = 15 May 2019 | work = [[The Face (magazine)|The Face]] }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Little Engine That Could]]''\n{{Portal|United Kingdom}}\n\n== Note ==\n*Awdry, Christopher (2005).

However, this has begun to change in recent years with films like ''El Toque del Oboe'' (1998); ''[[Mar\u00eda Escobar]]'' (2002); ''O Amigo Dunor'' (2005), which competed for Best Movie in the [[Rotterdam International Film Festival]];<ref>https://iffr.com/en/2005/films/o-amigo-dunor</ref> ''[[Hamaca Paraguaya]]'' (2006), which was screened at the [[Cannes Film Festival]],<ref>http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/films/hamaca-paraguaya</ref> gaining critical acclaim both in [[Paraguay]] and abroad; ''[[7 cajas]]'' (2012); ''[[Latas Vac\u00edas]]'' (2014); and ''Luna de Cigarras'' (2014).\n\n== History ==\nThe first films shot in Paraguay were a series of silent shorts by Argentine director [[Ernesto Gunche]] in 1905.<ref>http://www.portalguarani.com/1758_manuel_cuenca/13939_historia_del_audiovisual_en_el_paraguay_por_manuel_cuenca_.html</ref> The first Paraguayan-made film was [[Hip\u00f3lito Carr\u00f3n]]'s 10-minute-long silent ''[[Alma Paraguaya]]'', made in 1925. He went on to make a number of short documentaries with his nephew and assistant cameraman [[Agust\u00edn Carr\u00f3n Quell]]. A handful of documentaries were filmed in the country over the next few decades, though most of these are now lost. The 1932 documentary ''[[In the Hell of Chaco|En el Infierno del Chaco]]'' by the Argentine [[Roque Funes]] was the first film shot in Paraguay to use sound.\n\nFeature-length film in Paraguay beings with 1955's ''[[Codicia]]'', the first of several Argentine-Paraguayan co-productions, the most famous of which is probably ''[[La Burrerita de Ypacara\u00ed]]'' from 1962. The film industry in Paraguay has historically suffered from lack of funds, public interest and equipment, as well as the repressive [[Alfredo Stroessner]] government of 1954\u20131989. Argentine director [[Lucas Demare]] chose to film ''[[La Sed]]'' (1961), an adaptation of Paraguayan author [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]'s ''[[Hijo de hombre]]'', in Argentina because of this. The exception to this was the 1978 state-funded film ''[[Cerro Cora (film)|Cerro Cora]]'', directed by [[Guillermo Vera]], which promoted the historical and political views of the Stroessner government. This was the first wholly Paraguayan-made film and was based on the events of the [[Paraguayan War]].\n\nOnly a handful of films were made in Paraguay during the 1980s, though some Brazilian films were partly shot in the country. \n\n1989 saw the overthrow of Stroessner and the re-establishment of democracy. Since then the situation has slowly been improving; in 1990 the Fundaci\u00f3n Cinemateca del Paraguay was set up and the annual [[Asunci\u00f3n Film Festival]] inaugurated, and several new cinemas have been built in [[Asunci\u00f3n]] and other Paraguayan cities. The 1994 film ''[[Miss Amerigu\u00e1]]'' gained some international interest, as did 1998's ''[[El Toque del Oboe]]''. This has continued into the new century with films such as ''[[Mar\u00eda Escobar]]'' (2002), ''[[Miramenometokei]]'' (2003), ''[[Hamaca Paraguaya]]'' (2006), ''[[Felipe Canasto]]'' (2010) and ''[[Semana Capital]]'' (2010). Funding remains a problem, however, and the market is dominated largely by American and Argentine films.\n\nIn 2015 Paraguay submitted its first entry for consideration for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], [[Arami Ullon]]'s documentary ''[[Cloudy Times]]''.<ref name=\"88th\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/awards/oscars-paraguay-selects-cloudy-times-as-its-academy-award-entry-exclusive-1201585106/ |title=Oscars: Paraguay Selects \u2018Cloudy Times\u2019 as its Academy Award Entry |work=Variety|date=3 September 2015 |accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2017, the Film Academy of Paraguay chose its second candidate for the [[Oscar award]], ''Los buscadores'' (\"Gold Seekers\") by [[Juan Carlos Maneglia]] and Tana Sch\u00e9mbori, directors of ''7 Boxes''. ''Memory Exercises'' by Paz Encina was also nominated for a [[Goya Awards|Goya Award]] in [[Spain]].<ref>http://www.lanacion.com.py/espectaculo/2017/09/26/los-buscadores-y-ejercicios-de-memoria-preseleccionadas-para-el-oscar-y-el-goya/</ref>\n\nIn October 2017, the Senate approved with half sanction the bill of Audiovisual Promotion, with which the National Film Institute of Paraguay could be created.<ref>http://www.ultimahora.com/senado-aprueba-proyecto-ley-fomento-audiovisual-n1112783.html</ref>\n\n== List of Paraguayan directors ==\n\n* [[Luis A.

However, this has begun to change in recent years with films like ''El Toque del Oboe'' (1998); ''[[Mar\u00eda Escobar]]'' (2002); ''O Amigo Dunor'' (2005), which competed for Best Movie in the [[Rotterdam International Film Festival]];<ref>https://iffr.com/en/2005/films/o-amigo-dunor</ref> ''[[Hamaca Paraguaya]]'' (2006), which was screened at the [[Cannes Film Festival]],<ref>http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/films/hamaca-paraguaya</ref> gaining critical acclaim both in [[Paraguay]] and abroad; ''[[7 cajas]]'' (2012); ''[[Latas Vac\u00edas]]'' (2014); and ''Luna de Cigarras'' (2014).\n\n== History ==\nThe first films shot in Paraguay were a series of silent shorts by Argentine director [[Ernesto Gunche]] in 1905.<ref>http://www.portalguarani.com/1758_manuel_cuenca/13939_historia_del_audiovisual_en_el_paraguay_por_manuel_cuenca_.html</ref> The first Paraguayan-made film was [[Hip\u00f3lito Carr\u00f3n]]'s 10-minute-long silent ''[[Alma Paraguaya]]'', made in 1925. He went on to make a number of short documentaries with his nephew and assistant cameraman [[Agust\u00edn Carr\u00f3n Quell]]. A handful of documentaries were filmed in the country over the next few decades, though most of these are now lost. The 1932 documentary ''[[In the Hell of Chaco|En el Infierno del Chaco]]'' by the Argentine [[Roque Funes]] was the first film shot in Paraguay to use sound.\n\nFeature-length film in Paraguay beings with 1955's ''[[Codicia]]'', the first of several Argentine-Paraguayan co-productions, the most famous of which is probably ''[[La Burrerita de Ypacara\u00ed]]'' from 1962. The film industry in Paraguay has historically suffered from lack of funds, public interest and equipment, as well as the repressive [[Alfredo Stroessner]] government of 1954\u20131989. Argentine director [[Lucas Demare]] chose to film ''[[La Sed]]'' (1961), an adaptation of Paraguayan author [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]'s ''[[Hijo de hombre]]'', in Argentina because of this. The exception to this was the 1978 state-funded film ''[[Cerro Cora (film)|Cerro Cora]]'', directed by [[Guillermo Vera]], which promoted the historical and political views of the Stroessner government. This was the first wholly Paraguayan-made film and was based on the events of the [[Paraguayan War]].\n\nOnly a handful of films were made in Paraguay during the 1980s, though some Brazilian films were partly shot in the country. \n\n1989 saw the overthrow of Stroessner and the re-establishment of democracy. Since then the situation has slowly been improving; in 1990 the Fundaci\u00f3n Cinemateca del Paraguay was set up and the annual [[Asunci\u00f3n Film Festival]] inaugurated, and several new cinemas have been built in [[Asunci\u00f3n]] and other Paraguayan cities. The 1994 film ''[[Miss Amerigu\u00e1]]'' gained some international interest, as did 1998's ''[[El Toque del Oboe]]''. This has continued into the new century with films such as ''[[Mar\u00eda Escobar]]'' (2002), ''[[Miramenometokei]]'' (2003), ''[[Hamaca Paraguaya]]'' (2006), ''[[Felipe Canasto]]'' (2010) and ''[[Semana Capital]]'' (2010).

He is  best known for temporarily replacing [[Ringo Starr]] in [[the Beatles]] for a series of concerts during the height of [[Beatlemania]] in 1964, elevating him from relative obscurity to worldwide fame and then back again in the space of a fortnight.<ref>He used the spelling \"Jimmie Nicol\" on his own bass drum. See the {{cite web|url=http://www.pmouse.nl/nicol |title=Jimmie Nicol page from pmouse.nl |accessdate=2006-12-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111091533/http://www.pmouse.nl/nicol |archivedate=11 January 2012 }}</ref> Nicol had hoped that his association with the Beatles would greatly enhance his career but instead found that the spotlight moved away from him once Starr returned to the group, and in 1965 his subsequent lack of commercial success culminated in bankruptcy. In 1967, after having worked with a number of different bands which included a successful relationship with [[the Spotnicks]], he left the music business to pursue a variety of entrepreneurial ventures. Over the decades, Nicol increasingly shied away from media attention, preferring not to discuss his connection to the Beatles nor seeking financial gain from it. He has a son, Howard, who is a [[BAFTA]] award-winning sound engineer.\n\n==Early career==\nJimmie Nicol's career break came in 1957 when he was talent spotted by [[Larry Parnes]] whilst drumming with various bands in London's [[The 2i's Coffee Bar]], a time that saw Britain's [[skiffle]]-dominated music scene giving way to [[rock and roll]] which  was being popularised by its [[Teddy Boy]] youth. Parnes invited Nicol to join [[Colin Hicks & The Cabin Boys]] whom Parnes co-managed with John Kennedy (Colin Hicks is the younger brother of English entertainer [[Tommy Steele]], whom Parnes also managed). After taking a temporary break from the group to be a member of the original [[pit band]] in the [[Lionel Bart]] musical ''[[Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]] Nicol rejoined Hicks's band for their appearance in the 1958 Italian film documentary ''Europa Di Notte'', breaking them in Italy and subsequently allowing them to tour there extensively.{{sfn|Norman|2009|pp=180}} During the early sixties, Nicol went on to play for a number of artists, including [[Vince Eager]], [[Oscar Rabin]], and [[Cyril Stapleton]] and was kept in regular work through Charlie Katz, a well-known session fixer during that period. Nicol has cited drummer [[Phil Seamen]] and saxophonist [[Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley]] as being his main influences.{{sfn|pmouse.nl|2010}}\n\nIn 1964 Nicol helped to form The Shubdubs with former [[The Merseybeats|Merseybeats]] bassist Bob Garner, a jazz line-up similar in musical style to [[Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames]], a group with whom Nicol had sat-in with when they were the resident house band at London's now defunct [[Flamingo Jazz Club]]. Other members of The Shubdubs were [[Tony Allen (vocalist)|Tony Allen]] (vocals), [[Johnny Harris (musician)|Johnny Harris]] (trumpet), Quincy Davis (tenor saxophone), and [[Roger Coulam]] (organ \u2013 went on to form [[Blue Mink]]). It was at this point that he received a telephone call from [[the Beatles]]' producer, [[George Martin]]. Nicol recalled: \"I was having a bit of a lie down after lunch when the phone rang.\"{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}}\n\n==With the Beatles==\nWhen [[Ringo Starr]] collapsed with [[tonsillitis]] and was hospitalised on 3 June 1964, the eve of the Beatles' 1964 [[Australasia]]n tour, the band's manager [[Brian Epstein]] and their producer [[George Martin]] urgently discussed the feasibility of using a stand-in drummer rather than cancelling part of the tour. Martin suggested Jimmie Nicol as he had recently used him on a recording session with [[Tommy Quickly]].{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} Nicol had also drummed on a 'Top Six' budget label album as part of an uncredited session band, as well as an [[extended play]] single (with three tracks on each side) of Beatles [[cover versions]] (marketed as 'Teenagers Choice' and titled ''Beatlemania'') which meant that he already knew the songs and their arrangements. Producer Bill Wellings and Shubdubs trumpeter Johnny Harris (freelancing as an arranger and composer) were responsible for putting together alternative budget cover versions of songs taken from the British [[Hit Parade]] aimed at cash-strapped teenagers. Harris said: \"The idea was for me to try and guess which six songs would be topping the charts about a month ahead. I would do the arrangements and then go into the studio and record 'sound a-likes'; the first EP (extended play) released got to number 30 in the charts. Jimmie was on drums and, as you can imagine, we covered a lot of the Beatles' songs.\"{{sfn|Darren Stuart 2012}} Although [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] quickly accepted the idea of using an understudy, [[George Harrison]] threatened to pull out of the tour telling Epstein and Martin: \"If Ringo's not going, then neither am I. You can find two replacements.\"{{sfn|Badman|2000|pp=101}} Martin recalled: \"They nearly didn't do the Australia tour. George is a very loyal person. It took all of Brian's and my persuasion to tell George that if he didn't do it he was letting everybody down.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=139}} [[Tony Barrow]], who was the Beatles' press officer at the time, later commented: \"Brian saw it as the lesser of two evils; cancel the tour and upset thousands of fans or continue and upset the Beatles.\"{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} Ringo stated that \"it was very strange, them going off without me. They'd taken Jimmie Nicol and I thought they didn't love me any more \u2013 all that stuff went through my head.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=139}} The arrangements were made very quickly, from a telephone call to Nicol at his home in West London inviting him to attend an audition/rehearsal at [[Abbey Road Studios]],{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=45}} to packing his bags, all in the same day.{{sfn|Norman|1993|pp=231}} At a press conference a reporter mischievously asked John Lennon why [[Pete Best]], who had been the Beatles' previous drummer for two years but dismissed by the group on the eve of stardom, was not being given the opportunity of replacing Ringo, to which Lennon replied: \"He's got his own group [Pete Best & the All Stars], and it might have looked as if we were taking him back, which is not good for him.\"{{sfn|Badman|2000|pp=103}}\n\n[[File:The Beatles (with Jimmy Nicol) 1964 001.png|thumb|left|McCartney, Harrison, Lennon, and Nicol in the [[Netherlands]] on 5 June 1964]]\nNicol's first concert with the Beatles took place just 27 hours later on 4 June at the KB Hallen in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]. He was given the distinctive Beatle [[moptop]] hairstyle, put on Ringo's suit and went on stage to an audience of 4,500 Beatles fans. McCartney recalled: \"He was sitting up on this rostrum just eyeing up all the women. We'd start '[[She Loves You]]': [counting in] 'one, two', nothing, 'one, two', and still nothing!\" Their set was reduced from eleven songs to ten, dropping Ringo's vocal spot of \"[[I Wanna Be Your Man]]\".{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} McCartney teasingly sent Starr a telegram saying: \"Hurry up and get well Ringo, Jimmy is wearing out all your suits.\"{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} Commenting later on the fickle nature of his brief celebrity, Nicol reflected: \"The day before I was a Beatle, girls weren't interested in me at all. The day after, with the suit and the Beatle cut, riding in the back of the limo with John and Paul, they were dying to get a touch of me. It was very strange and quite scary.\" He was also able to shed some light on how they passed the time between shows: \"I thought I could drink and lay women with the best of them until I caught up with these guys.\"{{sfn|Q|2010|pp=56}}\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], Nicol and Lennon allegedly spent a whole night at a brothel.{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} Lennon said: \"It was some kind of scene on the road. [[Satyricon]]! There's photographs of me grovelling about, crawling about Amsterdam on my knees, coming out of whorehouses, and people saying 'Good morning John'. The police escorted me to these places because they never wanted a big scandal. When we hit town, we hit it \u2013 we were not pissing about. We had [the women]. They were great. We didn't call them groupies, then; I've forgotten what we called them, something like 'slags'.\"{{sfn|Q|2010|pp=56}}{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=139}} By then the Beatles were becoming more restricted by their increasing fame and spending most of their free time inside hotel suites. But Nicol discovered that, aside from acting as a Beatle, he could behave much as any tourist could: \"I often went out alone. Hardly anybody recognised me and I was able to wander around. In Hong Kong, I went to see the thousands of people who live on little boats in the harbour. I saw the refugees in [[Kowloon]], and I visited a nightclub. I like to see life. A Beatle could never really do that.\"{{sfn|Badman|2000|pp=110}}\n\nNicol played a total of eight shows until Starr rejoined the group in Melbourne, Australia, on 14 June. He was unable to say goodbye to the Beatles as they were still asleep when he left, and he did not want to disturb them. At Melbourne Airport, Epstein presented him with a cheque for \u00a3500 and a gold [[Eterna|Eterna-matic]] wrist watch inscribed: \"From the Beatles and Brian Epstein to Jimmy \u2013 with appreciation and gratitude.\"{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} George Martin later paid tribute to Nicol whilst recognising the problems he experienced in trying to readjust to a normal life again: \"Jimmie Nicol was a very good drummer who came along and learnt Ringo's parts very well. He did the job excellently, and faded into obscurity immediately afterwards.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=139}} Paul McCartney acknowledged: \"It wasn't an easy thing for Jimmy to stand in for Ringo, and have all that fame thrust upon him. And the minute his tenure was over, he wasn't famous any more.\" Nicol himself expressed his disillusionment several years later: \"Standing in for Ringo was the worst thing that ever happened to me. Until then I was quite happy earning \u00a330 or \u00a340 a week. After the headlines died, I began dying too.\"{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} He resisted the temptation to sell his story, stating in a rare 1987 interview: \"After the money ran low, I thought of cashing-in in some way or other. But the timing wasn't right. And I didn't want to step on the Beatles' toes. They had been damn good for me and to me.\"\n\n==Later career and life==\nNicol reformed the Shubdubs, renaming themselves Jimmy Nicol and the Shubdubs. They released two singles \"Husky\"/\"Don't Come Back\", followed by \"Humpty Dumpty\"/\"Night Train\"; neither of which was a commercial success. He was later called upon to again stand in for an ailing drummer when Dave Clark of [[The Dave Clark Five]] fell ill and Nicol's band, Jimmy Nicol and the Shubdubs, filled in for The Dave Clark Five in [[Blackpool, Lancashire]].{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} Whilst there Nicol was reminded of just how popular, albeit briefly, he had been as a stand-in Beatle; receiving a bundle of 5,000 fan letters passed on to him from an Australian radio disc jockey. Nicol sent a message back thanking the fans, promising that he would one day return to Australia permanently.{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} He was later reunited with the Beatles when his band appeared on the same bill as them and [[The Fourmost]] on 12 July 1964 at the [[Brighton Hippodrome|Hippodrome]] in [[Brighton]]. In 1965 Nicol declared bankruptcy with debts of \u00a34,066, nine months after being a temporary Beatle.{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} Later that year he joined the successful Swedish group [[the Spotnicks]], recording with them and twice touring the world. He left them in 1967, spending time in Mexico studying [[samba]] and [[bossa nova]] rhythms, whilst also diversifying into business. In 1975 he returned to England and became involved with housing renovations. In 1988 it was rumoured that Nicol had died,{{sfn|pmouse.nl|2010}}, the year after making his final interview and four years after his 1984 appearance at a Beatles convention in [[Amsterdam]], but an article in 2005 by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' claimed that he was still alive and living in London, refusing to do any interviews or talk about his tenure with the Beatles. It was later asserted by the same source that he had moved to [[Mexico]] in 2013 with his then-wife and was still living there as of 2017, despite family and friends having no contact with him.<ref>Daily Mail, 2017</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nDuring Nicol's brief time with the Beatles both Lennon and McCartney would often ask him how he felt he was coping, to which his reply would usually be \"It's getting better\". Three years later McCartney was walking his dog, Martha, with [[Hunter Davies]], the Beatles official biographer, when the sun came out. McCartney remarked that the weather was \"getting better\" and began to laugh, remembering Nicol. This event inspired the song \"[[Getting Better]]\" on 1967's ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.{{sfn|Miles|1998|pp=313}} McCartney again makes reference to Nicol on the ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' tapes from 1969, saying: \"I think you'll find we're not going abroad 'cause Ringo just said he doesn't want to go abroad. You know, he put his foot down. Although Jimmie Nicol might go abroad.\"  \n\nWhile appearing on the radio show ''Fresh Air'' hosted by [[Terry Gross]] in April 2016, [[Tom Hanks]] noted that he was at least partly influenced by Jimmie Nicol's experience with the Beatles when he wrote the script for his 1996 feature film ''[[That Thing You Do!]]''<ref name=\"fa\">{{Cite AV media| time=12:46 |work=[[Fresh Air]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=April 26, 2016 |title=Tom Hanks Says Self-Doubt Is 'A High-Wire Act That We All Walk'}}</ref>\n\n==Discography and performance history==\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!1950s\n|colspan=2| \n*Choir boy at Honeywell Road School, [[Wandsworth]], in London.\n*The [[Boys' Brigade]] (percussion).\n*[[Army Cadet Force|Army Cadet]] [[Military Band]] (percussion and xylophone).\n*For a short time, Nicol also worked as a drum repairer for (UK) musical instrument distributor ''Boosey & Hawkes''.\n|-\n!1957\u20131958\n|colspan=2| Colin Hicks & The Cabin Boys.

He is  best known for temporarily replacing [[Ringo Starr]] in [[the Beatles]] for a series of concerts during the height of [[Beatlemania]] in 1964, elevating him from relative obscurity to worldwide fame and then back again in the space of a fortnight.<ref>He used the spelling \"Jimmie Nicol\" on his own bass drum.

In 1967, after having worked with a number of different bands which included a successful relationship with [[the Spotnicks]], he left the music business to pursue a variety of entrepreneurial ventures. Over the decades, Nicol increasingly shied away from media attention, preferring not to discuss his connection to the Beatles nor seeking financial gain from it. He has a son, Howard, who is a [[BAFTA]] award-winning sound engineer.\n\n==Early career==\nJimmie Nicol's career break came in 1957 when he was talent spotted by [[Larry Parnes]] whilst drumming with various bands in London's [[The 2i's Coffee Bar]], a time that saw Britain's [[skiffle]]-dominated music scene giving way to [[rock and roll]] which  was being popularised by its [[Teddy Boy]] youth. Parnes invited Nicol to join [[Colin Hicks & The Cabin Boys]] whom Parnes co-managed with John Kennedy (Colin Hicks is the younger brother of English entertainer [[Tommy Steele]], whom Parnes also managed). After taking a temporary break from the group to be a member of the original [[pit band]] in the [[Lionel Bart]] musical ''[[Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]] Nicol rejoined Hicks's band for their appearance in the 1958 Italian film documentary ''Europa Di Notte'', breaking them in Italy and subsequently allowing them to tour there extensively.{{sfn|Norman|2009|pp=180}} During the early sixties, Nicol went on to play for a number of artists, including [[Vince Eager]], [[Oscar Rabin]], and [[Cyril Stapleton]] and was kept in regular work through Charlie Katz, a well-known session fixer during that period. Nicol has cited drummer [[Phil Seamen]] and saxophonist [[Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley]] as being his main influences.{{sfn|pmouse.nl|2010}}\n\nIn 1964 Nicol helped to form The Shubdubs with former [[The Merseybeats|Merseybeats]] bassist Bob Garner, a jazz line-up similar in musical style to [[Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames]], a group with whom Nicol had sat-in with when they were the resident house band at London's now defunct [[Flamingo Jazz Club]]. Other members of The Shubdubs were [[Tony Allen (vocalist)|Tony Allen]] (vocals), [[Johnny Harris (musician)|Johnny Harris]] (trumpet), Quincy Davis (tenor saxophone), and [[Roger Coulam]] (organ \u2013 went on to form [[Blue Mink]]). It was at this point that he received a telephone call from [[the Beatles]]' producer, [[George Martin]]. Nicol recalled: \"I was having a bit of a lie down after lunch when the phone rang.\"{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}}\n\n==With the Beatles==\nWhen [[Ringo Starr]] collapsed with [[tonsillitis]] and was hospitalised on 3 June 1964, the eve of the Beatles' 1964 [[Australasia]]n tour, the band's manager [[Brian Epstein]] and their producer [[George Martin]] urgently discussed the feasibility of using a stand-in drummer rather than cancelling part of the tour.

But Nicol discovered that, aside from acting as a Beatle, he could behave much as any tourist could: \"I often went out alone. Hardly anybody recognised me and I was able to wander around. In Hong Kong, I went to see the thousands of people who live on little boats in the harbour. I saw the refugees in [[Kowloon]], and I visited a nightclub. I like to see life. A Beatle could never really do that.\"{{sfn|Badman|2000|pp=110}}\n\nNicol played a total of eight shows until Starr rejoined the group in Melbourne, Australia, on 14 June. He was unable to say goodbye to the Beatles as they were still asleep when he left, and he did not want to disturb them. At Melbourne Airport, Epstein presented him with a cheque for \u00a3500 and a gold [[Eterna|Eterna-matic]] wrist watch inscribed: \"From the Beatles and Brian Epstein to Jimmy \u2013 with appreciation and gratitude.\"{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} George Martin later paid tribute to Nicol whilst recognising the problems he experienced in trying to readjust to a normal life again: \"Jimmie Nicol was a very good drummer who came along and learnt Ringo's parts very well. He did the job excellently, and faded into obscurity immediately afterwards.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=139}} Paul McCartney acknowledged: \"It wasn't an easy thing for Jimmy to stand in for Ringo, and have all that fame thrust upon him. And the minute his tenure was over, he wasn't famous any more.\" Nicol himself expressed his disillusionment several years later: \"Standing in for Ringo was the worst thing that ever happened to me. Until then I was quite happy earning \u00a330 or \u00a340 a week. After the headlines died, I began dying too.\"{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} He resisted the temptation to sell his story, stating in a rare 1987 interview: \"After the money ran low, I thought of cashing-in in some way or other. But the timing wasn't right. And I didn't want to step on the Beatles' toes. They had been damn good for me and to me.\"\n\n==Later career and life==\nNicol reformed the Shubdubs, renaming themselves Jimmy Nicol and the Shubdubs. They released two singles \"Husky\"/\"Don't Come Back\", followed by \"Humpty Dumpty\"/\"Night Train\"; neither of which was a commercial success. He was later called upon to again stand in for an ailing drummer when Dave Clark of [[The Dave Clark Five]] fell ill and Nicol's band, Jimmy Nicol and the Shubdubs, filled in for The Dave Clark Five in [[Blackpool, Lancashire]].{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} Whilst there Nicol was reminded of just how popular, albeit briefly, he had been as a stand-in Beatle; receiving a bundle of 5,000 fan letters passed on to him from an Australian radio disc jockey. Nicol sent a message back thanking the fans, promising that he would one day return to Australia permanently.{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} He was later reunited with the Beatles when his band appeared on the same bill as them and [[The Fourmost]] on 12 July 1964 at the [[Brighton Hippodrome|Hippodrome]] in [[Brighton]]. In 1965 Nicol declared bankruptcy with debts of \u00a34,066, nine months after being a temporary Beatle.{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} Later that year he joined the successful Swedish group [[the Spotnicks]], recording with them and twice touring the world. He left them in 1967, spending time in Mexico studying [[samba]] and [[bossa nova]] rhythms, whilst also diversifying into business. In 1975 he returned to England and became involved with housing renovations. In 1988 it was rumoured that Nicol had died,{{sfn|pmouse.nl|2010}}, the year after making his final interview and four years after his 1984 appearance at a Beatles convention in [[Amsterdam]], but an article in 2005 by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' claimed that he was still alive and living in London, refusing to do any interviews or talk about his tenure with the Beatles. It was later asserted by the same source that he had moved to [[Mexico]] in 2013 with his then-wife and was still living there as of 2017, despite family and friends having no contact with him.<ref>Daily Mail, 2017</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nDuring Nicol's brief time with the Beatles both Lennon and McCartney would often ask him how he felt he was coping, to which his reply would usually be \"It's getting better\". Three years later McCartney was walking his dog, Martha, with [[Hunter Davies]], the Beatles official biographer, when the sun came out. McCartney remarked that the weather was \"getting better\" and began to laugh, remembering Nicol. This event inspired the song \"[[Getting Better]]\" on 1967's ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.{{sfn|Miles|1998|pp=313}} McCartney again makes reference to Nicol on the ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' tapes from 1969, saying: \"I think you'll find we're not going abroad 'cause Ringo just said he doesn't want to go abroad. You know, he put his foot down. Although Jimmie Nicol might go abroad.\"  \n\nWhile appearing on the radio show ''Fresh Air'' hosted by [[Terry Gross]] in April 2016, [[Tom Hanks]] noted that he was at least partly influenced by Jimmie Nicol's experience with the Beatles when he wrote the script for his 1996 feature film ''[[That Thing You Do!]]''<ref name=\"fa\">{{Cite AV media| time=12:46 |work=[[Fresh Air]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=April 26, 2016 |title=Tom Hanks Says Self-Doubt Is 'A High-Wire Act That We All Walk'}}</ref>\n\n==Discography and performance history==\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!1950s\n|colspan=2| \n*Choir boy at Honeywell Road School, [[Wandsworth]], in London.\n*The [[Boys' Brigade]] (percussion).\n*[[Army Cadet Force|Army Cadet]] [[Military Band]] (percussion and xylophone).\n*For a short time, Nicol also worked as a drum repairer for (UK) musical instrument distributor ''Boosey & Hawkes''.\n|-\n!1957\u20131958\n|colspan=2| Colin Hicks & The Cabin Boys.

It is probably Berg's best-known and most frequently performed instrumental piece, in which the composer sought to reconcile [[diatonicism]] and [[dodecaphony]]. Berg composed it on a commission from [[Louis Krasner]], and it became the last work that he completed. Krasner performed the solo part in the premiere at the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]], [[Barcelona]] on 19 April 1936, after the composer's death.\n\n== Conception and composition ==\nThe piece stemmed from a commission from the [[violin]]ist [[Louis Krasner]]. When he first received the commission, Berg was working on his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', and he did not begin work on the [[concerto]] for some months. The event that spurred him into writing was the death by polio of 18-year-old [[Manon Gropius]], the daughter of [[Alma Mahler]] (once [[Gustav Mahler]]'s wife) and [[Walter Gropius]]. Berg set ''Lulu'' aside to write the concerto, which he dedicated \"To the memory of an angel\".<ref name=\"Glass\" />\n\nBerg worked on the piece very quickly, completing it within a few months; it is thought that his working on the concerto was largely responsible for his failing to complete ''Lulu'' before his death on 24 December 1935. The violin concerto was the last work that Berg completed. In a letter to Krasner dated 16 July 1935, Berg confessed: {{quote|Yesterday I finished the composition [without the orchestration] of our Violin Concerto. I am probably more surprised by it than you will be (...) the work gave me more and more joy. I hope - no, I have the confident belief - that I have succeeded.{{cn|date=April 2020}}}}<!-- looked in ''Berg: Violin Concerto'' (1991) by Anthony Pople and Julian Rushton, but can't find it there -->\n\n== Scoring ==\n[[File:Louis Krasner (1903\u20131995) und Helene Berg (1885\u20131976) mit der Partitur des Violinkonzerts (1961) OeNB 657332.png|thumb|[[Louis Krasner|Krasner]] and Berg's widow [[:de:Helene Berg|Helene]] with the score (1961)]]\nThe concerto is scored for 2 [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (both doubling as [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s (one doubling as a [[cor anglais]]), [[alto saxophone]] (doubling as 3rd clarinet), 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[trumpet]]s, 2 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[percussion]], [[harp]] and [[string section|strings]].<ref name=\"Glass\">{{cite news\n |last         = Glass\n |first        = Herbert\n |url          = https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |title        = Violin Concerto \u2013 About the piece\n |publisher    = [[LA Phil]]\n |accessdate   = 2 November 2017\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012243/https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |archive-date = 7 November 2017\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nBerg described the structure of the concerto in a letter to [[Arnold Schoenberg]].<ref>Brand et al. (eds.), ''The Berg-Schoenberg Correspondence'', p.466. quoted in Pople (1991) ,p.47.</ref> It is in two movements, each divided into two sections:\n\n{{ordered-list|type=upper-roman\n| {{ordered-list|type=lower-alpha\n  | Andante (Prelude)\n  | Allegretto (Scherzo)\n  }}\n| {{ordered-list|type=lower-alpha\n  | Allegro (Cadenza)\n  | Adagio (Chorale Variations)\n  }}\n}}\n\nThe work begins with an [[tempo|Andante]] in classical [[sonata form]], followed by the [[tempo|Allegretto]], a dance-like section. The second movement starts with an [[tempo|Allegro]] largely based on a single recurring [[rhythm]]ic [[cell (music)|cell]]; this section has been described as [[cadenza]]-like, with very difficult passages in the solo part. The orchestration becomes rather violent at its climax (which is literally marked in the score as \"High point of the Allegro\"); the fourth and final section, marked [[tempo|Adagio]], is in a much calmer mood. The first two sections are meant to represent life, the last two death and [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfiguration]].\n\n[[Image:Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.png|thumb|right|400px|\"lament\" melody and its construction from the pitches of RI-5 and P-8<ref>Whittall, Arnold. 2008.

New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-68200-8}} (pbk).</ref> {{audio|Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.mid|Play}}]]\n\nLike a number of other works by Berg, the piece combines the [[twelve tone technique]], typical of [[Serialism|serialistic music]] learned from his teacher [[Arnold Schoenberg]] with passages written in a freer, more tonal style. The score integrates serialism and tonality in a remarkable fashion. Here is Berg's tone row:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\new Staff \\with { \\remove \"Time_signature_engraver\" \\remove \"Bar_engraver\" } \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\override Stem #'transparent = ##t g4 bes d fis a c e gis b cis ees f } </score>\nAlthough this contains all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], there is a strong tonal undercurrent: the first three notes of the row make up a [[G minor]] [[Triad (music)|triad]]; notes three to five are a [[D major]] triad; notes five to seven are an [[A minor]] triad; notes seven to nine are an [[E major]] triad;\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> { \\new PianoStaff << \\new Staff \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\time 2/4 r8 <d bes>4( <d bes>8~ | <d bes> <d a>4 <d a>8~ | <d a>) <c a>4( <c a>8~ | <c a> <b e,>4 <b e,>8) } \\new Staff \\relative c { \\clef bass \\time 2/4 g,2( | fis' | e' | gis, } >> } </score>\nand the last four notes (B, C{{music|#}}, E{{music|b}}, F) and the first (G) together make up part of a [[whole tone scale]].  The roots of the four triads correspond to the [[Open string (music)|open strings]] of the violin, which is highlighted in the opening passage of the piece.\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\numericTimeSignature \\time 4/4 g8(\\pp d' a' e') e( a, d, g,~ | g1) } </score>\nThe resulting triads are thus fifth-related and form a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], which we hear directly before the row is played by the violin for the first time.  Moreover, the four chords above imply the note sequence  B (B{{music|flat}}) \u2013 A \u2013 C \u2013 H (B{{music|natural}}) which forms the [[BACH motif]], thus connecting the piece to [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], whose music plays a crucial role in this concerto. \n\nThe last four notes of the row, ascending whole tones, are also the first four notes of the [[chorale]] melody of \"[[Es ist genug]]\" (It is enough), another part of the whole tone scale. Bach composed a [[SATB|four-part]] setting of the hymn by [[Franz Joachim Burmeister]] with a melody by [[Johann Rudolph Ahle]] to conclude his cantata [[O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 60|''O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort'', BWV 60]] (O eternity, you word of thunder).<ref>[http://www.bach-chorales.com/BWV0060_5.htm BWV 60.5] bach-chorales.com</ref> The first four measures are shown below.\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n   \\new PianoStaff <<\n      \\new Staff <<\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key f \\major \\time 4/4\n             \\[ f2 g4 a \n             b2 \\] r4 b\n             c4 g g bes! \n             a2.\n             }\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemDown\n              c2 c4 bes8 a \n              e'2 s4 e\n              e4. f8 e d e c \n              f2.\n              }\n            >>\n     \\new Staff <<\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemUp \\clef bass \\key f \\major \\time 4/4\n             a2 g4 d' \n             d2 r4 gis,\n             a8 b c4 c c \n             c2.\n             }\n         \\new Voice \\relative c {\n             \\stemDown\n             f2 e4 fis \n             gis2 s4 e\n             a8 g!16 f e8 d c bes! a g!\n             f2.\n             }\n         >>\n    >>\n</score>\n\nBerg quotes this chorale directly in the last movement of the piece, where Bach's harmonization is heard in the [[clarinet]]s. \n\nThere is another directly quoted tonal passage in the work in the form of a [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthian]] [[folk song]] in the second section of the first movement, which returns briefly before the [[Coda (music)|coda]] in the second movement.

It is probably Berg's best-known and most frequently performed instrumental piece, in which the composer sought to reconcile [[diatonicism]] and [[dodecaphony]]. Berg composed it on a commission from [[Louis Krasner]], and it became the last work that he completed. Krasner performed the solo part in the premiere at the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]], [[Barcelona]] on 19 April 1936, after the composer's death.\n\n== Conception and composition ==\nThe piece stemmed from a commission from the [[violin]]ist [[Louis Krasner]]. When he first received the commission, Berg was working on his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', and he did not begin work on the [[concerto]] for some months. The event that spurred him into writing was the death by polio of 18-year-old [[Manon Gropius]], the daughter of [[Alma Mahler]] (once [[Gustav Mahler]]'s wife) and [[Walter Gropius]]. Berg set ''Lulu'' aside to write the concerto, which he dedicated \"To the memory of an angel\".<ref name=\"Glass\" />\n\nBerg worked on the piece very quickly, completing it within a few months; it is thought that his working on the concerto was largely responsible for his failing to complete ''Lulu'' before his death on 24 December 1935. The violin concerto was the last work that Berg completed. In a letter to Krasner dated 16 July 1935, Berg confessed: {{quote|Yesterday I finished the composition [without the orchestration] of our Violin Concerto. I am probably more surprised by it than you will be (...) the work gave me more and more joy. I hope - no, I have the confident belief - that I have succeeded.{{cn|date=April 2020}}}}<!-- looked in ''Berg: Violin Concerto'' (1991) by Anthony Pople and Julian Rushton, but can't find it there -->\n\n== Scoring ==\n[[File:Louis Krasner (1903\u20131995) und Helene Berg (1885\u20131976) mit der Partitur des Violinkonzerts (1961) OeNB 657332.png|thumb|[[Louis Krasner|Krasner]] and Berg's widow [[:de:Helene Berg|Helene]] with the score (1961)]]\nThe concerto is scored for 2 [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (both doubling as [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s (one doubling as a [[cor anglais]]), [[alto saxophone]] (doubling as 3rd clarinet), 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[trumpet]]s, 2 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[percussion]], [[harp]] and [[string section|strings]].<ref name=\"Glass\">{{cite news\n |last         = Glass\n |first        = Herbert\n |url          = https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |title        = Violin Concerto \u2013 About the piece\n |publisher    = [[LA Phil]]\n |accessdate   = 2 November 2017\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012243/https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |archive-date = 7 November 2017\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nBerg described the structure of the concerto in a letter to [[Arnold Schoenberg]].<ref>Brand et al. (eds.), ''The Berg-Schoenberg Correspondence'', p.466. quoted in Pople (1991) ,p.47.</ref> It is in two movements, each divided into two sections:\n\n{{ordered-list|type=upper-roman\n| {{ordered-list|type=lower-alpha\n  | Andante (Prelude)\n  | Allegretto (Scherzo)\n  }}\n| {{ordered-list|type=lower-alpha\n  | Allegro (Cadenza)\n  | Adagio (Chorale Variations)\n  }}\n}}\n\nThe work begins with an [[tempo|Andante]] in classical [[sonata form]], followed by the [[tempo|Allegretto]], a dance-like section. The second movement starts with an [[tempo|Allegro]] largely based on a single recurring [[rhythm]]ic [[cell (music)|cell]]; this section has been described as [[cadenza]]-like, with very difficult passages in the solo part. The orchestration becomes rather violent at its climax (which is literally marked in the score as \"High point of the Allegro\"); the fourth and final section, marked [[tempo|Adagio]], is in a much calmer mood. The first two sections are meant to represent life, the last two death and [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfiguration]].\n\n[[Image:Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.png|thumb|right|400px|\"lament\" melody and its construction from the pitches of RI-5 and P-8<ref>Whittall, Arnold. 2008.

New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-68200-8}} (pbk).</ref> {{audio|Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.mid|Play}}]]\n\nLike a number of other works by Berg, the piece combines the [[twelve tone technique]], typical of [[Serialism|serialistic music]] learned from his teacher [[Arnold Schoenberg]] with passages written in a freer, more tonal style. The score integrates serialism and tonality in a remarkable fashion. Here is Berg's tone row:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\new Staff \\with { \\remove \"Time_signature_engraver\" \\remove \"Bar_engraver\" } \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\override Stem #'transparent = ##t g4 bes d fis a c e gis b cis ees f } </score>\nAlthough this contains all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], there is a strong tonal undercurrent: the first three notes of the row make up a [[G minor]] [[Triad (music)|triad]]; notes three to five are a [[D major]] triad; notes five to seven are an [[A minor]] triad; notes seven to nine are an [[E major]] triad;\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> { \\new PianoStaff << \\new Staff \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\time 2/4 r8 <d bes>4( <d bes>8~ | <d bes> <d a>4 <d a>8~ | <d a>) <c a>4( <c a>8~ | <c a> <b e,>4 <b e,>8) } \\new Staff \\relative c { \\clef bass \\time 2/4 g,2( | fis' | e' | gis, } >> } </score>\nand the last four notes (B, C{{music|#}}, E{{music|b}}, F) and the first (G) together make up part of a [[whole tone scale]].  The roots of the four triads correspond to the [[Open string (music)|open strings]] of the violin, which is highlighted in the opening passage of the piece.\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\numericTimeSignature \\time 4/4 g8(\\pp d' a' e') e( a, d, g,~ | g1) } </score>\nThe resulting triads are thus fifth-related and form a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], which we hear directly before the row is played by the violin for the first time.  Moreover, the four chords above imply the note sequence  B (B{{music|flat}}) \u2013 A \u2013 C \u2013 H (B{{music|natural}}) which forms the [[BACH motif]], thus connecting the piece to [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], whose music plays a crucial role in this concerto. \n\nThe last four notes of the row, ascending whole tones, are also the first four notes of the [[chorale]] melody of \"[[Es ist genug]]\" (It is enough), another part of the whole tone scale. Bach composed a [[SATB|four-part]] setting of the hymn by [[Franz Joachim Burmeister]] with a melody by [[Johann Rudolph Ahle]] to conclude his cantata [[O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 60|''O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort'', BWV 60]] (O eternity, you word of thunder).<ref>[http://www.bach-chorales.com/BWV0060_5.htm BWV 60.5] bach-chorales.com</ref> The first four measures are shown below.\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n   \\new PianoStaff <<\n      \\new Staff <<\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key f \\major \\time 4/4\n             \\[ f2 g4 a \n             b2 \\] r4 b\n             c4 g g bes! \n             a2.\n             }\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemDown\n              c2 c4 bes8 a \n              e'2 s4 e\n              e4. f8 e d e c \n              f2.\n              }\n            >>\n     \\new Staff <<\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemUp \\clef bass \\key f \\major \\time 4/4\n             a2 g4 d' \n             d2 r4 gis,\n             a8 b c4 c c \n             c2.\n             }\n         \\new Voice \\relative c {\n             \\stemDown\n             f2 e4 fis \n             gis2 s4 e\n             a8 g!16 f e8 d c bes! a g!\n             f2.\n             }\n         >>\n    >>\n</score>\n\nBerg quotes this chorale directly in the last movement of the piece, where Bach's harmonization is heard in the [[clarinet]]s. \n\nThere is another directly quoted tonal passage in the work in the form of a [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthian]] [[folk song]] in the second section of the first movement, which returns briefly before the [[Coda (music)|coda]] in the second movement. This is perhaps the only section which does not derive its materials from the row.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 3/4 \\partial 4*1 << { d4 | b'8. b16 d4 g8 b | b,4 d g | fis4. e8 e4 | c2. | c'4. fis,8 d4 | c' fis, d8 c' | b2 g8 b | d,2 } \\\\ { d,4 | g8. g16 b4 d | g, b e | d4. c8 c4 | fis,2. | fis'4. d8 c4 | fis d c8 fis | g2 d8 d | b2 } >> } </score>\n\nAnthony Pople describes the work as \"less serial than ''Lulu''\", containing originally serial material later repeated or developed outside that framework, in addition to small adjustments throughout to avoid bare octaves.<ref>Pople, Anthony (1991).

Today some other laptop orchestras\u2014including the Stanford Laptop Orchestra (SLOrk), which was directly inspired by PLOrk\u2014also employ ChucK.|first=Brittany|last=Petersen|date=2008-06-11}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n\n* [[Comparison of audio synthesis environments]]\n* [[Sonic Pi]]\n* [[Pure Data]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n\n=== Literature by its authors ===\n* {{Cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=G.|year=2008|title=The ChucK Audio Programming Language|journal=PhD Thesis, Princeton University.|url=https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~ge/thesis.html}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=G.|first2=P.|last2=Cook|year=2003|title=ChucK: A concurrent, on-the-fly audio programming language|journal=Proceedings of the [[International Computer Music Conference]]|url=http://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/publications/chuck_icmc2003.pdf}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=G.|first2=P.|last2=Cook|year=2004|title=On-the-fly programming: Using code as an expressive musical instrument|journal=Proceedings of the International Conference on [[New Interfaces for Musical Expression]]|url=http://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/publications/on-the-fly_nime2004.pdf}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=G.|first2=P.|last2=Cook|year=2004|title=The Audicle: A context-sensitive, on-the-fly audio programming environ/mentality|journal=In Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference|url=http://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/publications/audicle_icmc2004.pdf}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=G|first2=A.|last2=Misra|first3=A|last3=Kapur|first4=P|last4=Cook|year=2005|title=Yeah ChucK it! => Dynamic, controllable, interface mapping|journal=Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression|url=http://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/publications/chuck_nime2005.pdf}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=G.|first2=P.|last2=Cook|first3=A|last3=Misra|year=2005|title=Designing and implementing the ChucK programming language|journal=Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference|url=http://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/publications/chuck_icmc2005.pdf}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=G|first2=R|last2=Fiebrink|first3=P|last3=Cook|year=2007|title=Combining analysis and synthesis in the ChucK programming language|journal=Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference|url=http://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/publications/uana_icmc2007.pdf}}\n* {{cite book|editor=Nicholas Collins, Julio d'Escriv\u00e1n|title=The Cambridge companion to electronic music|series=[[Cambridge Companions to Music]]|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86861-7|page=69|author=Wang, G.|chapter=}}\n\n=== Seemingly independent coverage ===\n* Graham Morrison, (2009) ''Generate choons with Chuck''.
