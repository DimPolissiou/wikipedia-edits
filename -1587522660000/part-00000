It encompasses areas formerly included in the main park, but was spun off as a separate admission in 2010, with the addition of new attractions and a repaint of the Barracuda Bay slides, 'Cuda Falls as well as the removal of the changing rooms in front of Barracuda Bay. Also, the Barracuda Bay entrance was closed off making Barracuda Bay only accessible from the bridge near Hook's Lagoon. After 2010, the separate admission was omitted.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2010, ''Barracuda Bay'' was the name of the central location of the water park, and encompassed multiple slides. Most of the slides were removed leaving only the ''''Cuda Falls''' slides still operating in the complex until its last season (2012). The slide complex was demolished before the 2014 season. All water attractions are included with the price of park admission tickets.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2019, ''Splashtown at Darien Lake'' was the name of the water park after ''Barracuda Bay''.\n\nAt the end of the 2019 season it was announced that [[Six flags]] was renaming the water park ''Six Flags Hurricane Harbor''. And also announced a new water slide will be added for the 2020 season.\n\n==List of attractions==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=78%\n|-\n! width=150 | Name\n! Type\n!

From his start as a music prodigy, he came to be regarded as a respected figure in the history of film music. He won nine [[Academy Awards]] and was nominated 45 times,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000055/awards|title=Alfred Newman|website=IMDb|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref> contributing to the Newmans being the [[List of Academy Award-winning families#Extended family|most nominated Academy Award extended family]], with a collective 92 nominations in various music categories.\n\nIn a career spanning more than four decades, Newman composed the scores for over 200 motion pictures. Some of his most famous scores include ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'', ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'', ''[[How Green Was My Valley (film)|How Green Was My Valley]]'', ''[[The Song of Bernadette (film)|The Song of Bernadette]]'', ''[[Captain from Castile]]'', ''[[All About Eve]]'', ''[[Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing (film)|Love is a Many Splendored Thing]]'', ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'', ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'', ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How The West Was Won]]'', ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'', and his final score, ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'', all of which were nominated for or won Academy Awards. He is perhaps best known for composing the fanfare which accompanies the studio logo at the beginning of [[20th Century Fox]]'s productions.\n\nNewman was also highly regarded as a conductor, and arranged and conducted many scores by other composers, including [[George Gershwin]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[Irving Berlin]]. He also conducted the music for many film adaptations of Broadway musicals (having worked on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] for ten years before coming to [[Hollywood]]), as well as many original Hollywood musicals.\n\nHe was among the first musicians to compose and conduct original music during Hollywood's [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age]] of movies, later becoming a respected and powerful music director in the history of Hollywood.<ref name=Henderson2/> Newman and two of his fellow composers, [[Max Steiner]] and [[Dimitri Tiomkin]], were considered the \"three godfathers of film music\".<ref name=MacDonald/><ref>[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/help/statistics/Gen-NomsFacts.pdf \"Nominee Facts - Most Nominations and Awards\"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402095027/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/help/statistics/Gen-NomsFacts.pdf |date=2016-04-02 }}, ''Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences''; retrieved November 30, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nNewman was born on March 17, 1900, in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], the eldest of ten children to [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian-Jewish]] parents who emigrated shortly before his birth.<ref name=MacDonald/>{{rp|27}}<ref name=Palmer/>{{rp|68}} Although many sources show a birth year of 1901, musicologist and composer [[Fred Steiner]] revealed that Alfred was actually born in 1900.

He wore many hats at the studio depending on the need, acting as composer, arranger, music director and conductor for various films.<ref name=TCM/> However, he said that he preferred arranging and conducting over composing because the latter was lonely and demanding work.

''Encyclopedia of Music in the 20th Century'', (2014) p. 446</ref> Newman's scores were developed around the overall mood of each film.

The effects of this style of music created a forceful but less jarring score which connected the entire story, thereby keeping the film's theme more easily understood by viewers.<ref name=Henderson/>\n\n''The Song of Bernadette'' (1943) is said to be one of Newman's loveliest scores, recorded over a four-week period with an 80-piece orchestra.<ref name=Green/> Newman used three different motifs to color different issues during the film.

''Jennifer Jones: The Life and Films'', McFarland (2011) p. 36</ref>\n\nNewman's score for [[Wilson (1944 film)|''Wilson'']] (1944), a biopic about president [[Woodrow Wilson]], required he devote an unusual amount of time to research. The film was intended to be a tribute to Wilson by producer [[Darryl F. Zanuck]]. Newman spent considerable time learning personal details about Wilson and his family, such as the songs they sang and played on their piano at home, the music they liked to dance and listen to, the songs they played during political rallies or political functions during his career. As a result, the film contained some forty realistic American-themed numbers intertwined throughout the film which gave it a strong sense of timeliness.<ref name=Palmer/>{{rp|89}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xh0IRgr-lI|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1940s Newman scored a number of films related to [[World War II]]. Among those were ''[[A Yank in the R.A.F.]]'' (1941), ''[[To the Shores of Tripoli]]'' (1942) and ''[[Twelve O'Clock High]]'' (1949), which one historian says is Newman's best dramatic opening theme for a movie.<ref name=MacDonald/>{{rp|117}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOg0R7PkKMc|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Newman also composed or music directed the score to some of [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Why We Fight]]'' series of films, including ''[[Prelude to War]]'' (1942) and ''[[War Comes to America]]'' (1945).

For films such as ''How Green Was My Valley'' (1941), for example, he incorporated Welsh hymns. For ''How The West Was Won'' (1962), he took folk tunes and transformed them into orchestral/choral works of tremendous power.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgnhJuI_onE|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> And for [[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|''The Grapes of Wrath'']] (1940), he brought in the folk tune favorite \"Red River Valley\" throughout the score.<ref name=Hischak/> His skill at incorporating familiar traditional music into modern scores was not limited to Western themes, however. During portions of the score for ''Love is a Many Splendored Thing'', for example, he created numbers with a distinctly Chinese sensibility, both with instruments and melodies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFJeE_fynjM|title=Love Is A Many Splendored Thing &#124; Soundtrack Suite (Alfred Newman)|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Generally, however, he would create his own original melody and turn it into something haunting and memorable, as he did for ''The Robe'' (1953).<ref name=Bogdanov/>\n\nIn 1947 he composed the music for ''Captain from Castile'', which included the famous \"Conquest march\", an impassioned score for the Spanish conquistadors.<ref name=Palmer/>{{rp|75}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXVWSAMq6aA|title=Alfred Newman 'Conquest March' ('Captain from Castile')|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> The march was adapted by the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) as the official theme song for their sports teams, the [[USC Trojans]].<ref>Shmelter, Richard.

He wore many hats at the studio depending on the need, acting as composer, arranger, music director and conductor for various films.<ref name=TCM/> However, he said that he preferred arranging and conducting over composing because the latter was lonely and demanding work. The demands of work contributed to his heavy smoking throughout his life, eventually leading to his [[emphysema]].<ref name=moviemusic>[https://moviemusicuk.us/2014/08/01/alfred-newman-fathers-of-film-music-part-3/ Alfred Newman's music style], ''Movie Music'', UK, August 1, 2014</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historiasdecinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/alfred-newman-escrevendo1.jpg|title=Alfred Newman smoking while composing|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHe was noted for developing what came to be known as the Newman System, a means of synchronizing the performance and recording of a musical score with the film, a system which is still in use today.<ref name=Henderson>Henderson, Lol; Stacey, Lee. ''Encyclopedia of Music in the 20th Century'', (2014) p. 446</ref> Newman's scores were developed around the overall mood of each film. He also tailored specific themes to accompany different characters as they appeared on screen, thereby enhancing each actor's role. The effects of this style of music created a forceful but less jarring score which connected the entire story, thereby keeping the film's theme more easily understood by viewers.<ref name=Henderson/>\n\n''The Song of Bernadette'' (1943) is said to be one of Newman's loveliest scores, recorded over a four-week period with an 80-piece orchestra.<ref name=Green/> Newman used three different motifs to color different issues during the film. Among them was a brass chorale to represent Mother Church,<ref name=Palmer/>{{rp|80}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pC9sHhKnzMQ|title=The Song Of Bernadette &#124; Soundtrack Suite (Alfred Newman)|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> while the theme representing Bernadette used strings to support her character's warmth and tenderness.<ref name=Palmer/>{{rp|81}} Newman's interpretation added the sound of the wind and blowing leaves to give the music an ethereal quality that augmented Bernadette's visions.<ref name=Hischak/><ref name=Green>Green, Paul. ''Jennifer Jones: The Life and Films'', McFarland (2011) p. 36</ref>\n \nNewman's score for [[Wilson (1944 film)|''Wilson'']] (1944), a biopic about president [[Woodrow Wilson]], required he devote an unusual amount of time to research. The film was intended to be a tribute to Wilson by producer [[Darryl F. Zanuck]]. Newman spent considerable time learning personal details about Wilson and his family, such as the songs they sang and played on their piano at home, the music they liked to dance and listen to, the songs they played during political rallies or political functions during his career. As a result, the film contained some forty realistic American-themed numbers intertwined throughout the film which gave it a strong sense of timeliness.<ref name=Palmer/>{{rp|89}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xh0IRgr-lI|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1940s Newman scored a number of films related to [[World War II]]. Among those were ''[[A Yank in the R.A.F.]]'' (1941), ''[[To the Shores of Tripoli]]'' (1942) and ''[[Twelve O'Clock High]]'' (1949), which one historian says is Newman's best dramatic opening theme for a movie.<ref name=MacDonald/>{{rp|117}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOg0R7PkKMc|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Newman also composed or music directed the score to some of [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Why We Fight]]'' series of films, including ''[[Prelude to War]]'' (1942) and ''[[War Comes to America]]'' (1945).

For films such as ''How Green Was My Valley'' (1941), for example, he incorporated Welsh hymns. For ''How The West Was Won'' (1962), he took folk tunes and transformed them into orchestral/choral works of tremendous power.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgnhJuI_onE|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> And for [[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|''The Grapes of Wrath'']] (1940), he brought in the folk tune favorite \"Red River Valley\" throughout the score.<ref name=Hischak/> His skill at incorporating familiar traditional music into modern scores was not limited to Western themes, however. During portions of the score for ''Love is a Many Splendored Thing'', for example, he created numbers with a distinctly Chinese sensibility, both with instruments and melodies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFJeE_fynjM|title=Love Is A Many Splendored Thing &#124; Soundtrack Suite (Alfred Newman)|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Generally, however, he would create his own original melody and turn it into something haunting and memorable, as he did for ''The Robe'' (1953).<ref name=Bogdanov/>\n\nIn 1947 he composed the music for ''Captain from Castile'', which included the famous \"Conquest march\", an impassioned score for the Spanish conquistadors.<ref name=Palmer/>{{rp|75}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXVWSAMq6aA|title=Alfred Newman 'Conquest March' ('Captain from Castile')|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> The march was adapted by the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) as the official theme song for their sports teams, the [[USC Trojans]].<ref>Shmelter, Richard.

Ned Kelly's age is written as 11\u00bd.}}  was an Australian [[bushranger]], outlaw, gang leader and convicted police murderer. One of the last bushrangers, and by far the most famous, he is best known for wearing [[armour of the Kelly gang|a suit of bulletproof armour]] during his final shootout with the police.\n\nKelly was born in the [[Crown colony|British colony]] of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] as the third of eight children to Irish parents. His father, a [[Convicts in Australia|transported convict]], died shortly after serving a six-month prison sentence, leaving Kelly, then aged 12, as the eldest male of the household. The Kellys were a poor [[selection (Australian history)|selector]] family who saw themselves as downtrodden by the [[squatting (pastoral)|Squattocracy]] and as victims of persecution by the [[Victoria Police]]. While a teenager, Kelly was arrested for associating with bushranger [[Harry Power]], and served two prison terms for a variety of offences, the longest stretch being from 1871 to 1874 on a conviction of receiving a stolen horse. He later joined the \"[[Greta, Victoria|Greta]] mob\", a group of [[Australian bush|bush]] [[larrikin]]s known for stock theft. A violent confrontation with a policeman occurred at the Kelly family's home in 1878, and Kelly was indicted for his attempted murder. Fleeing to the bush, Kelly vowed to avenge his mother, who was imprisoned for her role in the incident. After he, his younger brother [[Dan Kelly (bushranger)|Dan]], and two associates\u2014[[Joe Byrne]] and [[Steve Hart]]\u2014shot dead three policemen, the [[Government of Victoria]] proclaimed them [[outlaw]]s.\n\nKelly and his gang eluded the police for two years, thanks in part to the support of an extensive network of sympathisers. The gang's crime spree included raids on [[Euroa]] and [[Jerilderie]], and the killing of [[Aaron Sherritt]], a sympathiser turned police informer. In [[Jerilderie Letter|a manifesto letter]], Kelly\u2014denouncing the police, the Victorian government and the [[British Empire]]\u2014set down his own account of the events leading up to his outlawry. Demanding justice for his family and the rural poor, he threatened dire consequences against those who defied him. In 1880, when Kelly's attempt to derail and ambush a police train failed, he and his gang, dressed in armour fashioned from stolen [[plough#Parts|plough mouldboards]], engaged in a final gun battle with the police at [[Glenrowan, Victoria|Glenrowan]]. Kelly, the only survivor, was severely wounded by police fire and captured. Despite thousands of supporters attending rallies and signing a petition for his reprieve, Kelly was tried, convicted and sentenced to [[Hanging|death by hanging]], which was carried out at the [[Old Melbourne Gaol]]. His [[last words]] were famously reported to have been, \"[[:wikt:such is life|Such is life]]\".\n\nHistorian [[Geoffrey Serle]] called Kelly and his gang \"the last expression of the lawless frontier in what was becoming a highly organised and educated society, the last protest of the mighty bush now tethered with iron rails to [[Melbourne]] and the world\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Serle|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Serle|title=The Rush to Be Rich: A History of the Colony of Victoria 1883\u20131889|publisher=Melbourne University Press|year=1971|isbn=978-0-522-84009-4|page=11}}</ref> In the century after his death, Kelly became a [[cultural icon]], inspiring [[Ned Kelly in popular culture|numerous works in the arts and popular culture]], and is the subject of more biographies than any other Australian.

The Kellys formed part of his network of sympathisers, and by May 1869, Ned had become his bushranging prot\u00e9g\u00e9. At the end of the month, they attempted to steal horses from the [[Mansfield, Victoria|Mansfield]] property of squatter John Rower as part of a plan to rob the [[Woods Point, Victoria|Woods Point]]\u2013Mansfield gold escort. They abandoned the idea and fled back into the bush after Rower shot at them, and Kelly temporarily broke off his association with Power.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=85\u201386}}\n\nKelly's first brush with the law occurred in mid-October 1869 over an altercation between him and a Chinese pig and fowl dealer from [[Morses Creek]] named Ah Fook. According to Fook, as he passed the Kelly family home, Ned brandished a long stick and declared himself a bushranger before robbing him of 10 shillings. Fook then travelled to Benalla to give his account of what happened to Sergeant James Whelan, who was, according to fellow officers, \"a perfect encyclopedia of knowledge\" about the Kellys and their criminal activities.{{sfn|Jones|2010}} The next morning, Whelan chased down Kelly in the bush outside Greta and took him to Benalla, where he testified in court the next day that Fook abused his sister Annie for giving him creek water, not rain water, when, as a traveller, he requested a drink. Then, the story went, Fook beat Ned with a stick after he came to his sister's defence. Annie and two family-related witnesses corroborated Ned's story. Given that no other witnesses came forward, the charge was dismissed on 26 October and Kelly was released.{{sfn|Jones|2010}}\n\nKelly reconciled with Power in March 1870, and over the next month, the pair committed a series of armed robberies as police scrambled to find them and identify Power's young accomplice. By the end of April, the press had named Kelly as the culprit, and a few days later, he was captured by police and confined to [[HM Prison Beechworth|Beechworth Gaol]]. Kelly fronted court on three separate robbery charges, the first two of which were dismissed as none of the victims could positively identify him. On the third charge, the victims also reportedly failed to identify Kelly, but they were in fact refused a chance to identify him by Superintendents Nicolas and Hare. Instead, Nicolas told the magistrate that Kelly fitted the description and asked for him to be remanded for trial. He was sent to Melbourne where he spent the weekend in a lock-up before being transferred to [[Kyneton]] to face court. No evidence was produced in court, and he was released after a month. Historians tend to disagree over this episode: Some see it as evidence of [[Police misconduct|police harassment]]; others believe that the Kelly family intimidated the witnesses, making them reluctant to give evidence. Another factor in the lack of identification may have been that the witnesses had described Power's accomplice as a \"[[half-caste]]\" (a person of [[Aboriginal Australian|Aboriginal]] and European descent). However, the police believed this to be the result of Kelly going unwashed.{{sfn|Jones|2010}}\n\nPower often camped at Glenmore Station, a large property owned by Kelly's maternal grandfather, James Quinn, which sat at the headwaters of the [[King River (Victoria)|King River]]. In June 1870, while resting in a mountainside [[humpy|gunyah]] (bark shelter) that overlooked the property, Power was captured by a police search party. Following Power's arrest, word spread within the community that Kelly had informed on him. Kelly denied the rumour, and in [[s:Ned Kelly Letter to Sgt. James Babington|a letter]] that bears the only surviving example of his handwriting, he pleads with Sergeant James Babington of Kyneton for help, saying that \"everyone looks on me like a black snake\". The informant turned out to be Kelly's uncle, Jack Lloyd, who received \u00a3500 for his assistance.\n\nReporting on Power's criminal career, the ''[[Benalla Ensign]]'' wrote:{{sfn|Jones|2010}}\n\n{{quote|The effect of his example has already been to draw one young fellow into the open vortex of crime, and unless his career is speedily cut short, young Kelly will blossom into a declared enemy of society.}}\n\n===Horse theft, assault and imprisonment===\n[[File:Ned Kelly aged 15.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mugshot of Kelly, aged 15]]\nIn October 1870, a hawker, Jeremiah McCormack, accused a friend of the Kellys, Ben Gould, of stealing his horse. Gould wrote an indecent note to give to McCormack's childless wife, that was used to wrap two calves's [[testicles]]. Kelly passed it to one of his cousins to give to the woman. When McCormack confronted Kelly later that day, Kelly punched him in the nose, causing McCormack to fall. Kelly was arrested for his part in sending the calves' parts and the note and for assaulting McCormack. He was sentenced to three months' [[hard labour]] on each charge.\n\nKelly was released from Beechworth Gaol on 27 March 1871, five weeks early, and returned to Greta. Three weeks later, horse-breaker Isaiah \"Wild\" Wright arrived in town on what Kelly later described as a \"very remarkable\" chestnut [[mare]]. Wright visited the Kelly homestead to see his friend Alex Gunn, a Scottish miner who had married Kellys' older sister. Wright intended to ride the borrowed mare back to [[Mansfield, Victoria|Mansfield]], the home town of its owner, but discovered the next morning it had gone missing. Gunn lent him one of his own horses, promising that, if he found the mare, he would keep it until Wright returned. Soon after Wright departed, the mare was found by Gunn and a neighbour, William (Bricky) Williamson. Kelly then took the mare to [[Wangaratta]], where he stayed for four days. On 20 April 1871, while riding back into Greta, Kelly was intercepted by Constable Edward Hall, who suspected that the horse was stolen. He directed Kelly to the police station on the pretence of having to sign some papers. As Kelly dismounted, Hall tried to grab him by the scruff of the neck, but failed. When Kelly resisted arrest, Hall drew his revolver and tried to shoot him, but it misfired three times. He was then overpowered by Kelly, who later said that he straddled him and dug spurs into his thighs, causing the constable to \"[roar] like a big calf attacked by dogs\". After subduing Kelly with the assistance of seven bystanders, Hall [[pistol-whipping|pistol-whipped]] him until his head became \"a mass of raw and bleeding flesh\".{{sfn|FitzSimons|2013|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nAlthough Kelly maintained that he did not know the mare belonged to someone other than Wright, he and Gunn were charged with horse stealing. When it was later revealed that Kelly was still imprisoned at Beechworth Gaol when the horse was taken, the charges were downgraded to \"feloniously receiving a horse\". Kelly and Gunn were sentenced to three years imprisonment with hard labour. Wright escaped arrest for the theft on 2 May following an \"exchange of shots\" with police, but was arrested the following day at the Kelly homestead and received eighteen months for stealing the horse.\n\n[[File:Ned Kelly boxing.jpg|thumb|upright|Kelly after defeating Isaiah \"Wild\" Wright in a 20-round bare-knuckle boxing match, August 1874]] \nKelly served his sentence at Beechworth Gaol, then at [[HM Prison Pentridge]] near Melbourne. On 25 June 1873, Kelly's good behaviour earned him a transfer to the [[prison hulk]] ''Sacramento'', anchored off [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]].

As lawlessness was rampant at Greta, it was recognised that the police station could not be left without protection and Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick, who, like the Kelly\u2019s, was also of Irish descent, was ordered there for relief duty. Fitzpatrick was aware of a warrant for Dan Kelly for horse stealing and he discussed with his sergeant at Benalla the idea of calling at the Kelly home on the way with the object of arresting Dan Kelly. The sergeant agreed with his actions, but warned him to be careful. He was instructed to proceed to Greta and rode through Wilton en route to Greta, stopping at the hotel there where he had one brandy and lemonade.\u00a0\n\nFinding Dan not at home, he remained with Kelly's mother and other family members, in conversation, for about an hour. According to Fitzpatrick, upon hearing someone chopping wood, he went to ensure that the chopping was licensed. The man proved to be William \"Bricky\" Williamson, a neighbour, who said that he needed a licence only if he was chopping on Crown land.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> (According to Williamson, he was at his own selection a half a mile from the Kelly\u2019s).\n\nFitzpatrick then observed two horsemen making towards the house he had just left. The men proved to be the teenager Dan Kelly and his brother-in-law, Bill Skillion. Fitzpatrick returned to the house and made the arrest. Dan asked to be allowed to have dinner before leaving. The constable consented, and stood near his prisoner. Whilst the constable was standing guard over Dan Kelly, the elder brother, Ned, rushed in and shot him in the left arm, two inches above the wrist, with a revolver. At the same time Ellen Kelly, Ned\u2019s mother, attacked Fitzpatrick hitting him over the head with a fire shovel, knocking him senseless.\n\nFitzpatrick stated that all except Kelly's mother had been armed with revolvers, that Kelly had shot him in the left wrist, and that Ellen Kelly had hit him on the helmet with a coal shovel. \n\nOn regaining consciousness, he was compelled by Ned Kelly to extract the bullet from his arm with a knife, so that it might not be used as evidence; and on promising to make no report against his assailants, he was allowed to depart. He had ridden away about a mile when he found that two horsemen were pursuing, but by spurring his horse into a gallop he escaped to the Winton hotel where he was assisted inside by the manager. He was offered a brandy and lemonade which he refused, but later accepted one drink. On regaining safety, he no longer considered the promise which he had made to the criminals as binding but reported the affair to his superior officer, when he reached Benalla accompanied by the hotel manager who rode with him.\n\n===Kelly's version of events===\n\n{{Quote|text=\"The witness which can prove Fitzpatrick's falsehood can be found by advertising and if this is not done immediately horrible disasters shall follow. Fitzpatrick shall be the cause of greater slaughter to the rising generation than St. Patrick was to the snakes and toads in Ireland.

Fitzpatrick then said, pulling out a revolver, \"I will blow your brains out if you interfere\". His mother replied, \"You would not be so handy with that popgun of yours if Ned were here\". Dan then said, trying to trick Fitzpatrick, \"There is Ned coming along by the side of the house\". While he was pretending to look out of the window for Ned, Dan cornered Fitzpatrick, took the revolver and claimed that he had released Fitzpatrick unharmed.\n\nKelly asserted that he was not present, and that Fitzpatrick's wounds were self-inflicted. Kenneally, who interviewed the remaining Kelly brother, Jim Kelly, and Kelly cousin and gang providore Tom Lloyd, in addition to closely examining the 1881 report by the Royal Commission on the Police Force of Victoria, wrote that Fitzpatrick was drunk when he arrived at the Kellys, that while he was waiting for Dan, he made a pass at Kate, and Dan threw him to the floor. In the ensuing struggle, Fitzgerald drew his revolver, Ned appeared, and with his brother seized the constable, disarming him, but not before he struck his wrist against the projecting part of the door lock, an injury he claimed to be a gunshot wound. \n\nAfter Ned Kelly was captured, he was asked by a journalist if Fitzpatrick tried to take liberties with his sister, Kate Kelly, he said \"No, that is a foolish story; if he or any other policeman tried to take liberties with my sister, Victoria would not hold him\". Kelly also admitted to having shot Fitzpatrick after his capture. Under oath, during Kelly\u2019s trial in Melbourne, Senior Constable Kelly described a conversation he had with Ned Kelly immediately after he had been captured at Glenrowan. \u201cBetween 3 and 6 the same morning had another conversation with prisoner in the presence of Constable Ryan. Gave him some milk and water. Asked him if Fitzpatrick\u2019s statement was correct. Prisoner said, \u201cYes, I shot him\u201d.\n\n===Trial===\nWilliamson and Skillion were arrested for their part in the affair. Kelly and Dan were nowhere to be found, but Ellen was taken into custody, along with her baby, Alice. At the Benalla Court, on 17 May 1878, Williamson, Skillion and Ellen Kelly, while on remand, were charged with aiding and abetting attempted murder. The three appeared on 9 October 1878 before Judge [[Redmond Barry]] and charged with attempted murder. Despite Fitzpatrick's doctor reporting a smell of alcohol on the constable and his inability to confirm the wrist wound was caused by a bullet, Fitzpatrick's evidence was accepted by the police, the judge, and the jury. The three were convicted on Fitzpatrick's evidence. Fitzpatrick's evidence would later be corroborated by Williamson when he was interviewed in prison by Captain Frederick Standish. Mrs Kelly, Skillion and Williamson were tried and convicted of accessory to attempted murder against Fitzpatrick. Skillion and Williamson both received sentences of six years and Ellen three years of hard labour. Barry stated that if Kelly were present he would \"give him 15 years\". Frank Harty, a successful and well-known farmer in the area, offered to pay Ellen Kelly's bail upon which bail was immediately refused.  When Kelly was executed, his mother was still in prison.\n\nEllen Kelly's sentence was considered unfair even by people who had no cause to be Kelly sympathizers. Alfred Wyatt, a police magistrate headquartered in Benalla, told the commission later that \"I thought the sentence upon that old woman, Mrs Kelly, a very severe one.\" Enoch Downes, a truant officer, recounted to the commission in 1881 that while speaking to Joe Byrne's mother, he said that he did not believe in the sentence and \"if policy had been used or consideration for the mother shown that two or three months would have been ample\".  When Kelly was executed, his mother was still in prison.\n\n==Stringybark Creek police murders==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 3|total_width=300\n| image1 = Bushranger Dan Kelly.jpg  |width1=157|height1=\n| image2 = SteveHart.jpg  |width2=143|height2=\n| image3 = Joe Byrne the 19th-century outlaw.jpg  |width3=177|height3=\n| footer = Greta mob members [[Dan Kelly (bushranger)|Dan Kelly]] (left), [[Steve Hart]] (centre) and [[Joe Byrne (bushranger)|Joe Byrne]] (right) took to bushranging with Ned Kelly after the Fitzpatrick incident.\n}}\n\n[[File:Mansfield-police-photomontage.jpg|thumb|upright|Clockwise from top left: Constable Lonigan, Sergeant Kennedy, Constable McIntyre and Constable Scanlan.]]\n[[File:MansfieldKellyMonument.JPG|thumb|upright|Monument erected in [[Mansfield, Victoria|Mansfield]] in 1880 in honour of the policemen murdered at Stringybark Creek]]\nAfter the sentences were handed down in Benalla Police Court, both Ned and Dan Kelly doubted that they could convince the police of their story.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=44}} So they went into hiding, where they were later joined by friends [[Joe Byrne (bushranger)|Joe Byrne]] and [[Steve Hart]].\n\nThe police had received information that the Kelly gang were in the Wombat Ranges, at the head of the [[King River (Victoria)|King River]].

At about noon Lonigan heard a strange noise down by the creek and McIntyre went to investigate, hoping that it could be some [[kangaroo]]s that he could shoot for dinner. Instead, he shot and killed some [[parrot]]s which he cooked for dinner. (Unaware at the time, the sound of the shots alerted the bushrangers to their location.) At about 5pm, McIntyre was at the fire making tea, with Lonigan by him, when they were suddenly surprised by the Kelly gang with the cry, \"Bail up, hold up your arms\". McIntyre testified that Kelly took his [[fowling piece]], and that all the gang members were armed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article114524063 |title=Trail of Ned Kelly.

Having left his revolver at the tent door, McInytre held up his hands as directed.  Almost immediately Kelly shifted his aim from McIntyre to Lonigan and fired.  Kelly shot him in the temple.<ref name=\"BUSHRANGING IN VICTORIA\"/> He fell to the ground and said, \"Oh Christ, I am shot\". He died a few seconds later. Kelly remarked, \"What a pity; what made the fool run?\"<ref name=\"BUSHRANGING IN VICTORIA\"/> Kelly had McIntyre searched and, when they found that he was unarmed, let him drop his hands. They took Lonigan and McIntyre's revolvers, and helped themselves to articles from the tent. Kelly talked to McIntyre and expressed his wonder that the police should have been so foolhardy as to look for him in the ranges. It was evident that he knew the exact state of the camp, the number of police and the description of the horses. He asked where the other two were, and told McIntyre he would kill him if he lied. McIntyre revealed their whereabouts and pleaded for their lives:\n{{quote|I told [Kelly] that they were both countrymen and co-religionists of his own. ... I thought he might be possessed of some of that patriotic-religious feeling which is such a bond of sympathy amongst the Irish people. My opinion is that he possessed none of this feeling.

A favourite expression of his was: 'I will let them see what one native [native-born Australian] can do.'}}\n\nMcIntyre asked whether he was to be shot. Kelly replied, \"No, why should I want to shoot you? Could I not have done it half an hour ago if I had wanted?\" He added, \"At first I thought you were Constable Flood. If you had been, I would have roasted you in the fire\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article108744150 |title=CONSTABLE M'INTYRE'S EVIDENCE. |newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|The Evening News]] |location=Sydney |date=7 August 1880 |accessdate=31 May 2014 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Kelly asked if the police came out to shoot him. \"No\", replied McIntyre, \"we came to apprehend you\". \"What\", asked Kelly, \"brings you out here at all? It is a shame to see fine big strapping fellows like you in a lazy loafing billet like policemen\".\n\nMcIntyre asked what they would do if he induced his comrades to surrender. Kelly stated, \"I'll shoot no man if he holds up his hands\", and that he would detain them all night, as he wanted a sleep, and let them go next morning without their guns or horses. McIntyre said that he would induce them to surrender if Kelly kept his word, and added that one of the two had many children. Kelly said, \"You can depend on us\". Kelly stated that Fitzpatrick was the cause of all this; that his mother and the rest had been unjustly \"lagged\" at Beechworth. He told McIntyre to leave the police force. McIntyre agreed, saying that he had thought about it for some time due to bad health. Ned asked McIntyre why their search party was carrying so much ammunition. McIntyre replied that it was to shoot kangaroos.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article114522713 |title=Prosecution of Ned Kelly. |newspaper=[[The Manaro Mercury, and Cooma and Bombala Advertiser]] |location=NSW |date=11 August 1880 |accessdate=9 August 2014 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stringybark attack.jpg|thumb|left|The Kelly gang prepares to open fire as Kennedy and Scanlan arrive.

They forced McIntyre to sit on a log, and Kelly threatened, \"Mind, I have a rifle for you if you give any alarm\". Kennedy and Scanlan rode into the camp. McIntyre went forward and said, \"Sergeant, I think you had better dismount and surrender, as you are surrounded\". Kelly at the same time called out, \"Put up your hands\". Kennedy appeared to think it was Lonigan who called out, and that a jest was intended, for he smiled and put his hand on his revolver case. He was instantly fired at,<ref name=\"BUSHRANGING IN VICTORIA\"/> but not hit. Kennedy then realised the hopelessness of his position, jumped off his horse, and begged for his life, \"It's all right, stop it, stop it\". Scanlan's horse was disturbed and he tried to dismount but fell to the ground, and was on all fours. As he rose Kelly shot him in the right chest killing him almost instantly.  \n\nThis account has been disputed by the great grandson of Sergeant Kennedy, who claims the story has been altered down the years in order to embellish the Kelly myth. He claims Kennedy was wounded twice in a hopeless fight, captured, and then murdered two hours later. by Kelly shooting him at point blank range with a shotgun to the chest. Kelly then robbed the corpse of a gold watch, a notebook and some coins.\n\nMcIntyre, believing that the gang intended to shoot the whole party,<ref name=\"BUSHRANGING IN VICTORIA\" /> fled on Kennedy's horse. Several shots were fired at McIntyre as he dashed down the creek but none reached him, the rifles apparently being empty by that stage and only the revolvers available.

After a rest, and using a match to illuminate a small compass, he travelled about 20 miles until he reached a farmhouse outside Mansfield, on Sunday afternoon.

The Kelly gang then followed him there, but was told that he went to [[Uralla, New South Wales|Uralla]] across the border in New South Wales. By the time they got to Uralla, Sullivan had left for [[Wagga Wagga]]. They followed him there but lost sight of him.

Kenneally, however, the gang arrived at Jerilderie having crossed the [[Murray River]] at [[Burramine]]. The group had heard of a crossing there, from where they could swim their horses but did not know where the landing place was on the opposite side of the river, so had [[Tom Lloyd (Australia)|Tom Lloyd]] investigate (the river was guarded by border police). After unsuccessfully trying to cross on his own, Lloyd employed the help of an owner of a hotel nearby, who pulled him across in a boat with Lloyd's horse paddling behind. After reporting the trip back to the rest of the gang, the group appropriated the boat to get across in two trips. Dan Kelly and Steve Hart reached Davidson's Hotel two miles south of Jerilderie on Saturday 2 February 1879 in time for tea, while the others waited in another area.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nAt about midnight on 8 February, the gang surrounded the Jerilderie Police Station. Ned rode to the front and shouted for the policemen to come out, claiming there was a drunken brawl at Davidson's Hotel. Constables George Devine and Henry Richards emerged and asked the stranger for more information. Once Ned established there were no other policemen inside, the gang held them up and locked them in a cell.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=342\u2013343}} Mary, Devine's wife, and their children were kept hostage inside the house as Ned stole all the firearms and ammunition. After this, he let them return to sleep, and with the rest of the gang stayed in the dining room until morning.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=342\u2013343}}\n\nThere was a chapel in the courthouse, 100 yards from the barracks. Mrs Devine's duty was to prepare the courthouse for mass. The next day, Sunday, she was allowed to do so, but was accompanied by one of the Kellys. At about 10&nbsp;am Kelly remained in the courthouse and helped Mrs Devine prepare the altar and dust the forms.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=90}} When this was done Kelly escorted her back to the barracks, where the door was closed and the blinds pulled to give the impression that the Devines were out. Hart and Dan Kelly, dressed in police uniform, walked to and from the stables during the day without attracting notice.\n\nOn Monday morning Byrne brought two horses to be shod, but the blacksmith suspected something strange in his manner,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} so he noted the horse's brands (according to Kenneally, the blacksmith was struck by the quality of these so-called police horses and thus noted their brands; according also to this version, the shoeing of the horses was charged to the government of New South Wales).{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=91}} About 10&nbsp;am the Kellys, with their hostage Constable Richards, went from the barracks, closely followed on horseback by Hart and Byrne. They all went to the Royal Hotel, where Cox, the landlord, told Richards that his companions were the Kellys. Ned Kelly said they wanted rooms at the Royal, and revealed his intentions to rob the bank. Hart and Byrne rode to the back and told the groom to stable their horses, but not to give them any feed. Hart went into the kitchen of the hotel, a few yards from the back entrance to the bank. Byrne then entered the rear of the bank, when he met the accountant, Mr Living, who told him to use the front entrance. Byrne displayed his revolver and induced him to surrender. Kenneally wrote, \"The shock caused Living to stutter and it has been alleged that he stuttered for the rest of his life\".{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|pp=92\u201393}} Byrne then walked him and Mackie, the junior accountant, into the bar, where Dan Kelly was on guard. Ned Kelly secured the bank manager, Mr Tarleton, who was ordered to open the safes. When this was done, he was put in with the others. All were liberated at a quarter to three.\n\nAfter the manager had been secured, Ned Kelly took Living back to the bank and asked him how much money they had. Living admitted to between \u00a3600 and \u00a3700. Living then handed him the teller's cash, \u00a3691. Kelly asked if they had more money, and Living answered \"No\". Kelly tried to open the safe's treasure drawer, and one of the keys was given to him; but he needed the second key. Byrne wanted to break it open with a sledgehammer, but Kelly got the key from the teller and found \u00a31650, making for a total of \u00a32141 stolen from the bank. Kelly noticed a deed-box. The group then went to the hotel where Kelly burned three or four bank books containing mortgage documents, in an effort to erase the debts and create losses for the banks, though not realizing that some had copies held by the titles office in Sydney.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=93}}<ref>Seal, Graham.

He then placed his revolver on the bar and announced, \"Anyone here may take it and shoot me dead, but if I'm shot, Jerilderie shall swim in its own blood.\"{{sfn|Jones|2010}} As the hotel's \"roughs\" cheered Kelly on, he learned that Hart had earlier stolen a watch from a local Methodist clergyman, Reverend J.

Two splendid police horses were taken, and other horses were wanted, but the residents claimed that they belonged to women, and McDougall in order to keep his race mare \"protested that he was a comparatively poor man\"{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=94}} and Kelly relented.

The outlaws selected a sharp curve in the line that ran across a deep ravine, and told their captives that they were going to \"send the train and its occupants to hell\".{{sfn|McMenomy|1984|p=152}}\n\nThe bushrangers took over Glenrowan without meeting resistance from the locals, and imprisoned them at Ann Jones' Glenrowan Inn, while the other hotel in town, McDonnell's Railway Hotel, was used to stable the gang's stolen horses, one of which carried a tin of blasting powder and fuses. Their packhorses also carried [[armour of the Kelly gang|suits of bullet-repelling armour]], each complete with a helmet and weighing about {{convert|44|kg}}.

Believing that Curnow was a sympathiser, Ned let him and his wife return home, but warned them to \"go quietly to bed and not to dream too loud\", as one of the gang would visit during the night. Back at the hotel, Kelly grew increasingly anxious over the train's non-arrival. The delay was caused by the fact that the policemen in Sherritt's hut waited until daylight to emerge and give the alarm, and news of the murder did not reach Melbourne until Sunday afternoon. Only at 1 am on Monday did a police train carrying troopers, [[Australian native police|native trackers]] and several journalists steam into Benalla to collect reinforcements. Upon hearing the train's approach at 3 am, Curnow, despite Kelly's warning, rushed to the line and warned the pilot train to stop by raising a lit candle behind a red scarf. He told the driver of the gang's plan. The trains then slowly made their way to Glenrowan.\n\nAround this time, Kelly decided to let the townspeople return home, but Ann Jones told them to stay to hear the outlaw lecture. Byrne interrupted the conversation, alerting the group about the train's arrival. The gang prepared for action and hurried to dress in their armour. Bracken meanwhile told the hostages to lie low, and escaped to the railway station to explain the situation to the police. Superintendent Hare led six constables and five native trackers towards the hotel where the armour-clad outlaws waited for them on the verandah. As the police approached the police commander Superintendent Hare noticed a single figure standing on the verandah, who immediately opened fire on the police. The police returned fire and the other three gang members all dressed in their armour joined Ned Kelly. In the first volley, Supt Hare was hit in the left wrist, and Ned Kelly was wounded in the left hand and arm and he received a shot to his right foot that entered at the toes and exited at his heel.\n\n{{Wide image|Glenrowan shootout.jpg|700px|The gang and police exchange gunfire. Drawing by [[Tom Carrington (illustrator)|Tom Carrington]], one of several journalists present during the battle.}}\n\nThe police and the gang fired at each other for about a quarter of an hour. During a lull, Superintendent Hare returned to the railway station with a shattered left wrist from one of the first shots fired. He bled profusely, and [[Tom Carrington (illustrator)|Tom Carrington]], artist for the ''[[Australasian Sketcher with Pen and Pencil|Australasian Sketcher]]'', used his handkerchief to compress the wound. Hare then ordered O'Connor and his men to surround the hotel, and later attempted to return to battle, but gradually lost so much blood that he had to be sent to Benalla for treatment. \n\nThe Royal Commission found that Ned Kelly having retreated into the hotel after the first volley almost certainly walked out the back door for about 150 metres leading his horse. At about 100 metres he dropped his rifle and continued where he lay down behind a log until just after 7 am in the morning.\n\nThe police, trackers and civilian volunteers surrounded the hotel throughout the night, and the firing continued intermittently. At about 5 am, nine reinforcements under Superintendent Sadleir arrived from Benalla, followed soon after by Sergeant Steele, of [[Wangaratta]], with six more policemen, for a total of about 30 men. Around this stage, Byrne made a toast while drinking whiskey at the bar, saying, \"Many more years in the bush for the Kelly gang!\" Moments later, a stray bullet passed through a small gap in his armour and severed his [[femoral artery]], and he bled out within minutes. Before daylight, Senior-Constable Kelly found a revolving rifle and a silk cap lying in the bush, about 100 yards from the hotel. The rifle was covered with blood and a pool of blood lay near it. They believed it to belong to one of the bushrangers, hinting that they had escaped. They proved to be those of Ned Kelly himself. At daybreak, the women and children among the hostages were allowed to depart. They were challenged as they approached the police line, to ensure that the outlaws were not attempting to escape in disguise.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Last stand and capture===\n[[File:A strange apparition Ned Kelly's last stand.jpg|thumb|left|\"A strange apparition\": when Kelly appeared out of the mist-shrouded bush, clad in armour, bewildered policemen took him to be a ghost, a [[bunyip]], and \"[[Satan|Old Nick]] himself\".]]\nIn the dim light of dawn, Kelly, dressed in his armour and armed with three handguns, rose out of the bush and attacked the police from their rear.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=412\u2013413}} Several members of the scattered police line returned fire but to no effect as Kelly moved steadily through the morning mist towards the hotel, his armour repelling bullets. The size and shape of the armour made him appear inhuman to the police, and his apparent invulnerability caused onlookers to react with \"superstitious awe\".{{sfn|Farwell|1970|p=200}} Constable Arthur, the first policeman to encounter Kelly, recalled: \"I was completely astonished, and could not understand what the object I was firing at was.\" One trooper exclaimed that it was a [[bunyip]] and could not be killed. A civilian volunteer cried out that it was [[Satan|the Devil]]. Journalist [[Tom Carrington (illustrator)|Tom Carrington]] wrote:{{sfn|Kieza|2017|p=414}}\n{{quote|With the steam rising from the ground, it looked for all the world like the [[ghost (Hamlet)|ghost of Hamlet's father]] with no head, only a very long thick neck ...

Kelly, weakened by blood loss, managed to advance 50 or so yards, at times stopping to change weapons or regain his composure after taking a bullet to the armour, the sensation being \"like blows from a man's fist\".{{sfn|McMenomy|1984|p=164}} After diving to the ground to avoid one of Kelly's shots, Sergeant Steele realised that the figure's legs were unprotected. He shot at them twice with his shotgun, tearing apart Kelly's hip and thigh. The outlaw staggered, then collapsed against a fallen tree and moaned, \"I'm done, I'm done\".{{sfn|Kieza|2017|p=416}} Steele went to disarm him, but Kelly fired once more, blowing the sergeant's hat off and burning the side of his face.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|p=417}} Several others assisted Steele in removing the armour, and expressed shock upon discovering that it was Kelly. He became quiet, shot in the left foot, left leg, right hand, left arm and twice in the region of the groin, although no bullet had penetrated his armour. He was carried to the railway station, placed in a guard's van and then taken to the stationmaster's office, where a doctor dressed his wounds.<ref name=\"DESTRUCTION\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5975546 |title=Destruction of the Kelly Gang. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=29 June 1880 |accessdate=21 February 2012 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=151}}\n\n[[File:Kelly-Capture-Monument.jpg|thumb|right|Monument marking the spot of Kelly's capture]]\n\nIn the meantime the siege continued.

At 10 am, a white flag or handkerchief was held out at the front door, and immediately afterwards about 30 male hostages emerged, while Dan and Hart defended the back door. The police ordered the hostages to lie down and were checked, one by one.

Ellen Hollow, Kelly's then 62-year-old grand-niece, offered to supply her own [[DNA]] to help identify Kelly's bones.<ref>''The Times'', 10 March 2008.</ref>\n\nOn the anniversary of Kelly's hanging, 11 November 2009, Tom Baxter handed the skull in his possession to police and it was historically and forensically tested along with the Pentridge remains. The skull was compared to a cast of the skull that had been stolen from the Old Melbourne Gaol in 1978 and proved to be a match. The skull was then compared to that in a newspaper photograph of worker Alex Talbot holding the skull recovered in 1929 which showed a close resemblance. Talbot was known to have taken a tooth from the skull as a [[souvenir]] and a media campaign to find the whereabouts of the tooth led to Talbot's grandson coming forward. The tooth was found to belong to the skull confirming it was indeed the skull recovered in 1929. In 2004, before the skull was handed to police, a cast of the skull was made and compared to the [[death mask]]s of those executed at Old Melbourne Gaol which eliminated all but two. The two were those of Kelly and Ernest Knox, who had been executed in March 1894 (headstone marked E.K., 19\u20133\u201394) and buried near Frederick Deeming (headstone marked with the initials A.W. and a D underneath). In April 1929, the skulls of the E.K. marked grave (which was thought at the time to belong to Kelly) and Frederick Deeming were looted from the excavated graves.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130315308 |title=GHOULISH SCRAMBLE. |newspaper=[[The Richmond River Express and Casino Kyogle Advertiser]] |location=NSW |date=17 April 1929 |accessdate=5 September 2014 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}\n</ref> The death mask of Knox and a facial reconstruction of a cast of the skull were a close match.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/tv/rewind/txt/s1168553.htm</ref> \n\nIn 2010 and 2011, the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine performed a series of craniofacial super-imposition, CT scanning, anthropology and DNA tests on the skull recovered from the E.K. marked grave and concluded it was not Kelly's.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vifm.org/education-and-research/the-ned-kelly-project/vifm-media-release/|title=VIFM Media Release - Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine|publisher=}}</ref> In 2014, the remains of Frederick Deeming's brother was exhumed from Bebington cemetery and tissue samples were obtained from the femur bone.

A match to Kelly was found and the associated skeleton turned out to be one of the most complete. Kelly's remains were additionally identified by partially healed right foot, right knee and [[Humerus|left elbow]] injuries matching those caused by the bullet wounds at Glenrowan as recorded by the gaol's surgeon in 1880 and by the fact that his head was missing, likely removed for phrenological study.

One of the last bushrangers, and by far the most famous, he is best known for wearing [[armour of the Kelly gang|a suit of bulletproof armour]] during his final shootout with the police.\n\nKelly was born in the [[Crown colony|British colony]] of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] as the third of eight children to Irish parents. His father, a [[Convicts in Australia|transported convict]], died shortly after serving a six-month prison sentence, leaving Kelly, then aged 12, as the eldest male of the household. The Kellys were a poor [[selection (Australian history)|selector]] family who saw themselves as downtrodden by the [[squatting (pastoral)|Squattocracy]] and as victims of persecution by the [[Victoria Police]]. While a teenager, Kelly was arrested for associating with bushranger [[Harry Power]], and served two prison terms for a variety of offences, the longest stretch being from 1871 to 1874 on a conviction of receiving a stolen horse. He later joined the \"[[Greta, Victoria|Greta]] mob\", a group of [[Australian bush|bush]] [[larrikin]]s known for stock theft. A violent confrontation with a policeman occurred at the Kelly family's home in 1878, and Kelly was indicted for his attempted murder. Fleeing to the bush, Kelly vowed to avenge his mother, who was imprisoned for her role in the incident. After he, his younger brother [[Dan Kelly (bushranger)|Dan]], and two associates\u2014[[Joe Byrne]] and [[Steve Hart]]\u2014shot dead three policemen, the [[Government of Victoria]] proclaimed them [[outlaw]]s.\n\nKelly and his gang eluded the police for two years, thanks in part to the support of an extensive network of sympathisers. The gang's crime spree included raids on [[Euroa]] and [[Jerilderie]], and the killing of [[Aaron Sherritt]], a sympathiser turned police informer. In [[Jerilderie Letter|a manifesto letter]], Kelly\u2014denouncing the police, the Victorian government and the [[British Empire]]\u2014set down his own account of the events leading up to his outlawry. Demanding justice for his family and the rural poor, he threatened dire consequences against those who defied him. In 1880, when Kelly's attempt to derail and ambush a police train failed, he and his gang, dressed in armour fashioned from stolen [[plough#Parts|plough mouldboards]], engaged in a final gun battle with the police at [[Glenrowan, Victoria|Glenrowan]]. Kelly, the only survivor, was severely wounded by police fire and captured. Despite thousands of supporters attending rallies and signing a petition for his reprieve, Kelly was tried, convicted and sentenced to [[Hanging|death by hanging]], which was carried out at the [[Old Melbourne Gaol]]. His [[last words]] were famously reported to have been, \"[[:wikt:such is life|Such is life]]\".\n\nHistorian [[Geoffrey Serle]] called Kelly and his gang \"the last expression of the lawless frontier in what was becoming a highly organised and educated society, the last protest of the mighty bush now tethered with iron rails to [[Melbourne]] and the world\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Serle|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Serle|title=The Rush to Be Rich: A History of the Colony of Victoria 1883\u20131889|publisher=Melbourne University Press|year=1971|isbn=978-0-522-84009-4|page=11}}</ref> In the century after his death, Kelly became a [[cultural icon]], inspiring [[Ned Kelly in popular culture|numerous works in the arts and popular culture]], and is the subject of more biographies than any other Australian.

Kelly was falsely accused of informing on the bushranger.\n }}\nIn 1869, aged fourteen, Kelly met Irish-born [[Harry Power]] (alias of Henry Johnson), a transported convict who turned to bushranging in North-Eastern Victoria after escaping Melbourne's [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]]. The Kellys formed part of his network of sympathisers, and by May 1869, Ned had become his bushranging prot\u00e9g\u00e9. At the end of the month, they attempted to steal horses from the [[Mansfield, Victoria|Mansfield]] property of squatter John Rower as part of a plan to rob the [[Woods Point, Victoria|Woods Point]]\u2013Mansfield gold escort. They abandoned the idea and fled back into the bush after Rower shot at them, and Kelly temporarily broke off his association with Power.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=85\u201386}}\n\nKelly's first brush with the law occurred in mid-October 1869 over an altercation between him and a Chinese pig and fowl dealer from [[Morses Creek]] named Ah Fook. According to Fook, as he passed the Kelly family home, Ned brandished a long stick and declared himself a bushranger before robbing him of 10 shillings. Fook then travelled to Benalla to give his account of what happened to Sergeant James Whelan, who was, according to fellow officers, \"a perfect encyclopedia of knowledge\" about the Kellys and their criminal activities.{{sfn|Jones|2010}} The next morning, Whelan chased down Kelly in the bush outside Greta and took him to Benalla, where he testified in court the next day that Fook abused his sister Annie for giving him creek water, not rain water, when, as a traveller, he requested a drink. Then, the story went, Fook beat Ned with a stick after he came to his sister's defence. Annie and two family-related witnesses corroborated Ned's story. Given that no other witnesses came forward, the charge was dismissed on 26 October and Kelly was released.{{sfn|Jones|2010}}\n\nKelly reconciled with Power in March 1870, and over the next month, the pair committed a series of armed robberies as police scrambled to find them and identify Power's young accomplice. By the end of April, the press had named Kelly as the culprit, and a few days later, he was captured by police and confined to [[HM Prison Beechworth|Beechworth Gaol]]. Kelly fronted court on three separate robbery charges, the first two of which were dismissed as none of the victims could positively identify him. On the third charge, the victims also reportedly failed to identify Kelly, but they were in fact refused a chance to identify him by Superintendents Nicolas and Hare. Instead, Nicolas told the magistrate that Kelly fitted the description and asked for him to be remanded for trial. He was sent to Melbourne where he spent the weekend in a lock-up before being transferred to [[Kyneton]] to face court. No evidence was produced in court, and he was released after a month. Historians tend to disagree over this episode: Some see it as evidence of [[Police misconduct|police harassment]]; others believe that the Kelly family intimidated the witnesses, making them reluctant to give evidence. Another factor in the lack of identification may have been that the witnesses had described Power's accomplice as a \"[[half-caste]]\" (a person of [[Aboriginal Australian|Aboriginal]] and European descent). However, the police believed this to be the result of Kelly going unwashed.{{sfn|Jones|2010}}\n\nPower often camped at Glenmore Station, a large property owned by Kelly's maternal grandfather, James Quinn, which sat at the headwaters of the [[King River (Victoria)|King River]]. In June 1870, while resting in a mountainside [[humpy|gunyah]] (bark shelter) that overlooked the property, Power was captured by a police search party. Following Power's arrest, word spread within the community that Kelly had informed on him. Kelly denied the rumour, and in [[s:Ned Kelly Letter to Sgt. James Babington|a letter]] that bears the only surviving example of his handwriting, he pleads with Sergeant James Babington of Kyneton for help, saying that \"everyone looks on me like a black snake\". The informant turned out to be Kelly's uncle, Jack Lloyd, who received \u00a3500 for his assistance.\n\nReporting on Power's criminal career, the ''[[Benalla Ensign]]'' wrote:{{sfn|Jones|2010}}\n\n{{quote|The effect of his example has already been to draw one young fellow into the open vortex of crime, and unless his career is speedily cut short, young Kelly will blossom into a declared enemy of society.}}\n\n===Horse theft, assault and imprisonment===\n[[File:Ned Kelly aged 15.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mugshot of Kelly, aged 15]]\nIn October 1870, a hawker, Jeremiah McCormack, accused a friend of the Kellys, Ben Gould, of stealing his horse. Gould wrote an indecent note to give to McCormack's childless wife, that was used to wrap two calves's [[testicles]]. Kelly passed it to one of his cousins to give to the woman. When McCormack confronted Kelly later that day, Kelly punched him in the nose, causing McCormack to fall. Kelly was arrested for his part in sending the calves' parts and the note and for assaulting McCormack. He was sentenced to three months' [[hard labour]] on each charge.\n\nKelly was released from Beechworth Gaol on 27 March 1871, five weeks early, and returned to Greta. Three weeks later, horse-breaker Isaiah \"Wild\" Wright arrived in town on what Kelly later described as a \"very remarkable\" chestnut [[mare]]. Wright visited the Kelly homestead to see his friend Alex Gunn, a Scottish miner who had married Kellys' older sister. Wright intended to ride the borrowed mare back to [[Mansfield, Victoria|Mansfield]], the home town of its owner, but discovered the next morning it had gone missing. Gunn lent him one of his own horses, promising that, if he found the mare, he would keep it until Wright returned. Soon after Wright departed, the mare was found by Gunn and a neighbour, William (Bricky) Williamson. Kelly then took the mare to [[Wangaratta]], where he stayed for four days. On 20 April 1871, while riding back into Greta, Kelly was intercepted by Constable Edward Hall, who suspected that the horse was stolen. He directed Kelly to the police station on the pretence of having to sign some papers. As Kelly dismounted, Hall tried to grab him by the scruff of the neck, but failed. When Kelly resisted arrest, Hall drew his revolver and tried to shoot him, but it misfired three times. He was then overpowered by Kelly, who later said that he straddled him and dug spurs into his thighs, causing the constable to \"[roar] like a big calf attacked by dogs\". After subduing Kelly with the assistance of seven bystanders, Hall [[pistol-whipping|pistol-whipped]] him until his head became \"a mass of raw and bleeding flesh\".{{sfn|FitzSimons|2013|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nAlthough Kelly maintained that he did not know the mare belonged to someone other than Wright, he and Gunn were charged with horse stealing. When it was later revealed that Kelly was still imprisoned at Beechworth Gaol when the horse was taken, the charges were downgraded to \"feloniously receiving a horse\". Kelly and Gunn were sentenced to three years imprisonment with hard labour. Wright escaped arrest for the theft on 2 May following an \"exchange of shots\" with police, but was arrested the following day at the Kelly homestead and received eighteen months for stealing the horse.\n\n[[File:Ned Kelly boxing.jpg|thumb|upright|Kelly after defeating Isaiah \"Wild\" Wright in a 20-round bare-knuckle boxing match, August 1874]] \nKelly served his sentence at Beechworth Gaol, then at [[HM Prison Pentridge]] near Melbourne. On 25 June 1873, Kelly's good behaviour earned him a transfer to the [[prison hulk]] ''Sacramento'', anchored off [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]]. He returned to Pentridge after several months and was released on 2 February 1874, six months early for good behaviour. That same month, his mother Ellen married an American, George King, with whom she had three children. King, Kelly and Dan Kelly became involved in cattle duffing.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126825077 |title=Overview of Kellyana |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=1 March 1981 |accessdate=18 April 2014 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/12452635|title=WE HAVE NO CATTLE \"RUSTLERS\" HERE |newspaper=[[The Argus Week-end Magazine]] |date=27 April 1940 |accessdate=6 December 2019 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nTo settle the score with Wright over the chestnut mare, Kelly fought him in a bare-knuckle boxing match at the Imperial Hotel in Beechworth, 8 August 1874.

During the struggle Kelly's trousers were ripped off. Trying to get Kelly to submit and taking advantage of his torn trousers, the Irish-born Constable Thomas Lonigan, whom Kelly later murdered at [[Stringybark Creek]], \"black-balled\" him (grabbed and squeezed his [[testicle]]s).{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=26}} During the struggle, a miller walked in, and on seeing the behaviour of the police said \"You should be ashamed of yourselves.\" He then tried to pacify the situation and induced Kelly to put on the handcuffs.<ref name=\"KELLY INTERVIEWED\">{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70946696|title=Kelly Interviewed|date=14 August 1880|newspaper=[[Australian Town and Country Journal]]|accessdate=16 June 2014|page=9|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nKelly said about the incident, \"It was in the course of this attempted arrest Fitzpatrick endeavoured to catch hold of me by the foot, and in the struggle he tore the sole and heel of my boot clean off.

As lawlessness was rampant at Greta, it was recognised that the police station could not be left without protection and Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick, who, like the Kelly\u2019s, was also of Irish descent, was ordered there for relief duty. Fitzpatrick was aware of a warrant for Dan Kelly for horse stealing and he discussed with his sergeant at Benalla the idea of calling at the Kelly home on the way with the object of arresting Dan Kelly. The sergeant agreed with his actions, but warned him to be careful. He was instructed to proceed to Greta and rode through Wilton en route to Greta, stopping at the hotel there where he had one brandy and lemonade.\u00a0\n\nFinding Dan not at home, he remained with Kelly's mother and other family members, in conversation, for about an hour. According to Fitzpatrick, upon hearing someone chopping wood, he went to ensure that the chopping was licensed. The man proved to be William \"Bricky\" Williamson, a neighbour, who said that he needed a licence only if he was chopping on Crown land.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> (According to Williamson, he was at his own selection a half a mile from the Kelly\u2019s).\n\nFitzpatrick then observed two horsemen making towards the house he had just left. The men proved to be the teenager Dan Kelly and his brother-in-law, Bill Skillion. Fitzpatrick returned to the house and made the arrest. Dan asked to be allowed to have dinner before leaving. The constable consented, and stood near his prisoner. Whilst the constable was standing guard over Dan Kelly, the elder brother, Ned, rushed in and shot him in the left arm, two inches above the wrist, with a revolver. At the same time Ellen Kelly, Ned\u2019s mother, attacked Fitzpatrick hitting him over the head with a fire shovel, knocking him senseless.\n\nFitzpatrick stated that all except Kelly's mother had been armed with revolvers, that Kelly had shot him in the left wrist, and that Ellen Kelly had hit him on the helmet with a coal shovel. \n\nOn regaining consciousness, he was compelled by Ned Kelly to extract the bullet from his arm with a knife, so that it might not be used as evidence; and on promising to make no report against his assailants, he was allowed to depart. He had ridden away about a mile when he found that two horsemen were pursuing, but by spurring his horse into a gallop he escaped to the Winton hotel where he was assisted inside by the manager. He was offered a brandy and lemonade which he refused, but later accepted one drink. On regaining safety, he no longer considered the promise which he had made to the criminals as binding but reported the affair to his superior officer, when he reached Benalla accompanied by the hotel manager who rode with him.\n\n===Kelly's version of events===\n\n{{Quote|text=\"The witness which can prove Fitzpatrick's falsehood can be found by advertising and if this is not done immediately horrible disasters shall follow.

Fitzpatrick then said, pulling out a revolver, \"I will blow your brains out if you interfere\". His mother replied, \"You would not be so handy with that popgun of yours if Ned were here\". Dan then said, trying to trick Fitzpatrick, \"There is Ned coming along by the side of the house\". While he was pretending to look out of the window for Ned, Dan cornered Fitzpatrick, took the revolver and claimed that he had released Fitzpatrick unharmed.\n\nKelly asserted that he was not present, and that Fitzpatrick's wounds were self-inflicted. Kenneally, who interviewed the remaining Kelly brother, Jim Kelly, and Kelly cousin and gang providore Tom Lloyd, in addition to closely examining the 1881 report by the Royal Commission on the Police Force of Victoria, wrote that Fitzpatrick was drunk when he arrived at the Kellys, that while he was waiting for Dan, he made a pass at Kate, and Dan threw him to the floor. In the ensuing struggle, Fitzgerald drew his revolver, Ned appeared, and with his brother seized the constable, disarming him, but not before he struck his wrist against the projecting part of the door lock, an injury he claimed to be a gunshot wound. \n\nAfter Ned Kelly was captured, he was asked by a journalist if Fitzpatrick tried to take liberties with his sister, Kate Kelly, he said \"No, that is a foolish story; if he or any other policeman tried to take liberties with my sister, Victoria would not hold him\". Kelly also admitted to having shot Fitzpatrick after his capture. Under oath, during Kelly\u2019s trial in Melbourne, Senior Constable Kelly described a conversation he had with Ned Kelly immediately after he had been captured at Glenrowan. \u201cBetween 3 and 6 the same morning had another conversation with prisoner in the presence of Constable Ryan. Gave him some milk and water. Asked him if Fitzpatrick\u2019s statement was correct. Prisoner said, \u201cYes, I shot him\u201d.\n\n===Trial===\nWilliamson and Skillion were arrested for their part in the affair. Kelly and Dan were nowhere to be found, but Ellen was taken into custody, along with her baby, Alice. At the Benalla Court, on 17 May 1878, Williamson, Skillion and Ellen Kelly, while on remand, were charged with aiding and abetting attempted murder. The three appeared on 9 October 1878 before Judge [[Redmond Barry]] and charged with attempted murder. Despite Fitzpatrick's doctor reporting a smell of alcohol on the constable and his inability to confirm the wrist wound was caused by a bullet, Fitzpatrick's evidence was accepted by the police, the judge, and the jury. The three were convicted on Fitzpatrick's evidence. Fitzpatrick's evidence would later be corroborated by Williamson when he was interviewed in prison by Captain Frederick Standish. Mrs Kelly, Skillion and Williamson were tried and convicted of accessory to attempted murder against Fitzpatrick. Skillion and Williamson both received sentences of six years and Ellen three years of hard labour. Barry stated that if Kelly were present he would \"give him 15 years\". Frank Harty, a successful and well-known farmer in the area, offered to pay Ellen Kelly's bail upon which bail was immediately refused.  When Kelly was executed, his mother was still in prison.\n\nEllen Kelly's sentence was considered unfair even by people who had no cause to be Kelly sympathizers. Alfred Wyatt, a police magistrate headquartered in Benalla, told the commission later that \"I thought the sentence upon that old woman, Mrs Kelly, a very severe one.\" Enoch Downes, a truant officer, recounted to the commission in 1881 that while speaking to Joe Byrne's mother, he said that he did not believe in the sentence and \"if policy had been used or consideration for the mother shown that two or three months would have been ample\".  When Kelly was executed, his mother was still in prison.\n\n==Stringybark Creek police murders==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 3|total_width=300\n| image1 = Bushranger Dan Kelly.jpg  |width1=157|height1=\n| image2 = SteveHart.jpg  |width2=143|height2=\n| image3 = Joe Byrne the 19th-century outlaw.jpg  |width3=177|height3=\n| footer = Greta mob members [[Dan Kelly (bushranger)|Dan Kelly]] (left), [[Steve Hart]] (centre) and [[Joe Byrne (bushranger)|Joe Byrne]] (right) took to bushranging with Ned Kelly after the Fitzpatrick incident.\n}}\n\n[[File:Mansfield-police-photomontage.jpg|thumb|upright|Clockwise from top left: Constable Lonigan, Sergeant Kennedy, Constable McIntyre and Constable Scanlan.]]\n[[File:MansfieldKellyMonument.JPG|thumb|upright|Monument erected in [[Mansfield, Victoria|Mansfield]] in 1880 in honour of the policemen murdered at Stringybark Creek]]\nAfter the sentences were handed down in Benalla Police Court, both Ned and Dan Kelly doubted that they could convince the police of their story.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=44}} So they went into hiding, where they were later joined by friends [[Joe Byrne (bushranger)|Joe Byrne]] and [[Steve Hart]].\n\nThe police had received information that the Kelly gang were in the Wombat Ranges, at the head of the [[King River (Victoria)|King River]].

At about noon Lonigan heard a strange noise down by the creek and McIntyre went to investigate, hoping that it could be some [[kangaroo]]s that he could shoot for dinner. Instead, he shot and killed some [[parrot]]s which he cooked for dinner. (Unaware at the time, the sound of the shots alerted the bushrangers to their location.) At about 5pm, McIntyre was at the fire making tea, with Lonigan by him, when they were suddenly surprised by the Kelly gang with the cry, \"Bail up, hold up your arms\". McIntyre testified that Kelly took his [[fowling piece]], and that all the gang members were armed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article114524063 |title=Trail of Ned Kelly.

Kelly remarked, \"What a pity; what made the fool run?\"<ref name=\"BUSHRANGING IN VICTORIA\"/> Kelly had McIntyre searched and, when they found that he was unarmed, let him drop his hands. They took Lonigan and McIntyre's revolvers, and helped themselves to articles from the tent. Kelly talked to McIntyre and expressed his wonder that the police should have been so foolhardy as to look for him in the ranges. It was evident that he knew the exact state of the camp, the number of police and the description of the horses. He asked where the other two were, and told McIntyre he would kill him if he lied. McIntyre revealed their whereabouts and pleaded for their lives:\n{{quote|I told [Kelly] that they were both countrymen and co-religionists of his own. ... I thought he might be possessed of some of that patriotic-religious feeling which is such a bond of sympathy amongst the Irish people. My opinion is that he possessed none of this feeling.

A favourite expression of his was: 'I will let them see what one native [native-born Australian] can do.'}}\n\nMcIntyre asked whether he was to be shot. Kelly replied, \"No, why should I want to shoot you? Could I not have done it half an hour ago if I had wanted?\" He added, \"At first I thought you were Constable Flood.

Kelly stated, \"I'll shoot no man if he holds up his hands\", and that he would detain them all night, as he wanted a sleep, and let them go next morning without their guns or horses. McIntyre said that he would induce them to surrender if Kelly kept his word, and added that one of the two had many children. Kelly said, \"You can depend on us\". Kelly stated that Fitzpatrick was the cause of all this; that his mother and the rest had been unjustly \"lagged\" at Beechworth. He told McIntyre to leave the police force. McIntyre agreed, saying that he had thought about it for some time due to bad health. Ned asked McIntyre why their search party was carrying so much ammunition. McIntyre replied that it was to shoot kangaroos.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article114522713 |title=Prosecution of Ned Kelly. |newspaper=[[The Manaro Mercury, and Cooma and Bombala Advertiser]] |location=NSW |date=11 August 1880 |accessdate=9 August 2014 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stringybark attack.jpg|thumb|left|The Kelly gang prepares to open fire as Kennedy and Scanlan arrive.

They forced McIntyre to sit on a log, and Kelly threatened, \"Mind, I have a rifle for you if you give any alarm\". Kennedy and Scanlan rode into the camp. McIntyre went forward and said, \"Sergeant, I think you had better dismount and surrender, as you are surrounded\". Kelly at the same time called out, \"Put up your hands\". Kennedy appeared to think it was Lonigan who called out, and that a jest was intended, for he smiled and put his hand on his revolver case. He was instantly fired at,<ref name=\"BUSHRANGING IN VICTORIA\"/> but not hit. Kennedy then realised the hopelessness of his position, jumped off his horse, and begged for his life, \"It's all right, stop it, stop it\". Scanlan's horse was disturbed and he tried to dismount but fell to the ground, and was on all fours. As he rose Kelly shot him in the right chest killing him almost instantly.  \n\nThis account has been disputed by the great grandson of Sergeant Kennedy, who claims the story has been altered down the years in order to embellish the Kelly myth. He claims Kennedy was wounded twice in a hopeless fight, captured, and then murdered two hours later. by Kelly shooting him at point blank range with a shotgun to the chest. Kelly then robbed the corpse of a gold watch, a notebook and some coins.\n\nMcIntyre, believing that the gang intended to shoot the whole party,<ref name=\"BUSHRANGING IN VICTORIA\" /> fled on Kennedy's horse. Several shots were fired at McIntyre as he dashed down the creek but none reached him, the rifles apparently being empty by that stage and only the revolvers available.

Suffering from a severe fall during his escape and with his clothes in tatters, McIntyre concealed himself in a [[wombat]] hole until dark, taking note of the direction of the setting sun. At about midnight, he set about to strike the Benalla road by trekking west, guided by a star. After crossing a number of streams, his feet became chafed, and had to walk with one of his boots off. After a rest, and using a match to illuminate a small compass, he travelled about 20 miles until he reached a farmhouse outside Mansfield, on Sunday afternoon. He then travelled by buggy to Mansfield and then directly to the residence of Sub-Inspector Pewtress.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5919040 |title=The Police Murders |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=30 October 1878 |accessdate=25 April 2012 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nTwo hours after McIntyre reported the murder of the troopers, Pewtress set out for camp, accompanied by McIntyre, Constable Allwood, Dr Reynolds, and five townspeople.

There they found the bodies of Scanlan and Lonigan, as well as the tent burnt and possessions looted or destroyed. The post-mortem, by Dr Reynolds, showed that Lonigan had received four wounds, one through the eyeball.

Ned threatened to shoot him, saying it would be easy to do so if the hawker \"did not keep a civil tongue in his head\". Gloster asked the bushranger who he was. He responded: \"I am Ned Kelly, the son of Red Kelly, and a better man never stood in two shoes.\" McCauley persuaded Gloster to surrender, and the pair joined the other prisoners in the storeroom. The Kellys stole new suits and a revolver from Gloster's stock as they wanted to look presentable at the bank. They offered the hawker money for them to which he refused. After sunset the hostages were allowed some fresh air.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=67}} Time passed quietly until 2 am, and at that hour the outlaws gave a peculiar whistle, and Hart and Byrne rushed from the building.

By the time they got to Uralla, Sullivan had left for [[Wagga Wagga]]. They followed him there but lost sight of him. Kelly thought that he might have travelled to [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]], so they took off in that direction but later gave up their chase.

Kenneally, however, the gang arrived at Jerilderie having crossed the [[Murray River]] at [[Burramine]]. The group had heard of a crossing there, from where they could swim their horses but did not know where the landing place was on the opposite side of the river, so had [[Tom Lloyd (Australia)|Tom Lloyd]] investigate (the river was guarded by border police). After unsuccessfully trying to cross on his own, Lloyd employed the help of an owner of a hotel nearby, who pulled him across in a boat with Lloyd's horse paddling behind. After reporting the trip back to the rest of the gang, the group appropriated the boat to get across in two trips. Dan Kelly and Steve Hart reached Davidson's Hotel two miles south of Jerilderie on Saturday 2 February 1879 in time for tea, while the others waited in another area.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nAt about midnight on 8 February, the gang surrounded the Jerilderie Police Station. Ned rode to the front and shouted for the policemen to come out, claiming there was a drunken brawl at Davidson's Hotel. Constables George Devine and Henry Richards emerged and asked the stranger for more information. Once Ned established there were no other policemen inside, the gang held them up and locked them in a cell.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=342\u2013343}} Mary, Devine's wife, and their children were kept hostage inside the house as Ned stole all the firearms and ammunition. After this, he let them return to sleep, and with the rest of the gang stayed in the dining room until morning.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=342\u2013343}}\n\nThere was a chapel in the courthouse, 100 yards from the barracks. Mrs Devine's duty was to prepare the courthouse for mass. The next day, Sunday, she was allowed to do so, but was accompanied by one of the Kellys. At about 10&nbsp;am Kelly remained in the courthouse and helped Mrs Devine prepare the altar and dust the forms.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=90}} When this was done Kelly escorted her back to the barracks, where the door was closed and the blinds pulled to give the impression that the Devines were out. Hart and Dan Kelly, dressed in police uniform, walked to and from the stables during the day without attracting notice.\n\nOn Monday morning Byrne brought two horses to be shod, but the blacksmith suspected something strange in his manner,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} so he noted the horse's brands (according to Kenneally, the blacksmith was struck by the quality of these so-called police horses and thus noted their brands; according also to this version, the shoeing of the horses was charged to the government of New South Wales).{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=91}} About 10&nbsp;am the Kellys, with their hostage Constable Richards, went from the barracks, closely followed on horseback by Hart and Byrne. They all went to the Royal Hotel, where Cox, the landlord, told Richards that his companions were the Kellys. Ned Kelly said they wanted rooms at the Royal, and revealed his intentions to rob the bank. Hart and Byrne rode to the back and told the groom to stable their horses, but not to give them any feed. Hart went into the kitchen of the hotel, a few yards from the back entrance to the bank. Byrne then entered the rear of the bank, when he met the accountant, Mr Living, who told him to use the front entrance. Byrne displayed his revolver and induced him to surrender. Kenneally wrote, \"The shock caused Living to stutter and it has been alleged that he stuttered for the rest of his life\".{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|pp=92\u201393}} Byrne then walked him and Mackie, the junior accountant, into the bar, where Dan Kelly was on guard. Ned Kelly secured the bank manager, Mr Tarleton, who was ordered to open the safes. When this was done, he was put in with the others. All were liberated at a quarter to three.\n\nAfter the manager had been secured, Ned Kelly took Living back to the bank and asked him how much money they had. Living admitted to between \u00a3600 and \u00a3700. Living then handed him the teller's cash, \u00a3691. Kelly asked if they had more money, and Living answered \"No\". Kelly tried to open the safe's treasure drawer, and one of the keys was given to him; but he needed the second key. Byrne wanted to break it open with a sledgehammer, but Kelly got the key from the teller and found \u00a31650, making for a total of \u00a32141 stolen from the bank. Kelly noticed a deed-box. The group then went to the hotel where Kelly burned three or four bank books containing mortgage documents, in an effort to erase the debts and create losses for the banks, though not realizing that some had copies held by the titles office in Sydney.{{sfn|Kenneally|1929|p=93}}<ref>Seal, Graham.

The police used the house of her neighbour, former Greta mob member and lifelong friend of Byrne, [[Aaron Sherritt]], as a base of operations, sleeping in it during the day and keeping watch from nearby caves at night. Sherritt accepted police payments for camping with the watch parties and for providing information on the bushrangers' activities.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=}} While many policemen suspected him of being a [[double agent]] for the gang, a detective, [[Michael Edward Ward|Michael Ward]], planned to bring the bushrangers out of hiding by spreading rumours that Sherritt's true loyalties lay with the police.{{sfn|Kelson|McQuilton|2001|p=128}} Convinced that he was a traitor, the gang decided to murder Sherritt as part of their own plan, one that they boasted would \"astonish not only the Australian colonies, but the whole world\".{{sfn|Farwell|1970|p=193}}\n\n[[File:MurderOfSherritt.jpg|thumb|left|Murder of Sherritt]]\nOn 26 June 1880, Dan and Byrne rode into the Woolshed Valley.

While Dan went to the front door of Sherritt's hut, Byrne forced Wick to knock on the back door and call out. \"What do you want?\" asked Sherritt. Prompted by Byrne, Wick replied that he had lost his way. Sherritt opened the door and joked with his neighbour as Belle Sherritt, his wife, told him to give directions.

They also surmised that the train would collect reinforcements in [[Benalla]] before continuing through [[Glenrowan, Victoria|Glenrowan]], a small town in the [[Warby Ranges]]. There, the gang planned to wreck the train and shoot dead any survivors, then ride to an unpoliced Benalla where they would rob the banks, set fire to the courthouse, blow up the police barracks, release anyone imprisoned in the gaol, and \"generally play havoc with the entire town\" before returning to the bush.{{sfn|Dawson|2018|pp=57\u201358}} While Byrne and Dan were in the Woolshed Valley, Ned and Hart tried, but failed, to damage the track at Glenrowan, so they forced line-repairers camped nearby to finish the job.

Believing that Curnow was a sympathiser, Ned let him and his wife return home, but warned them to \"go quietly to bed and not to dream too loud\", as one of the gang would visit during the night. Back at the hotel, Kelly grew increasingly anxious over the train's non-arrival. The delay was caused by the fact that the policemen in Sherritt's hut waited until daylight to emerge and give the alarm, and news of the murder did not reach Melbourne until Sunday afternoon. Only at 1 am on Monday did a police train carrying troopers, [[Australian native police|native trackers]] and several journalists steam into Benalla to collect reinforcements. Upon hearing the train's approach at 3 am, Curnow, despite Kelly's warning, rushed to the line and warned the pilot train to stop by raising a lit candle behind a red scarf. He told the driver of the gang's plan. The trains then slowly made their way to Glenrowan.\n\nAround this time, Kelly decided to let the townspeople return home, but Ann Jones told them to stay to hear the outlaw lecture. Byrne interrupted the conversation, alerting the group about the train's arrival. The gang prepared for action and hurried to dress in their armour. Bracken meanwhile told the hostages to lie low, and escaped to the railway station to explain the situation to the police. Superintendent Hare led six constables and five native trackers towards the hotel where the armour-clad outlaws waited for them on the verandah. As the police approached the police commander Superintendent Hare noticed a single figure standing on the verandah, who immediately opened fire on the police. The police returned fire and the other three gang members all dressed in their armour joined Ned Kelly. In the first volley, Supt Hare was hit in the left wrist, and Ned Kelly was wounded in the left hand and arm and he received a shot to his right foot that entered at the toes and exited at his heel.\n\n{{Wide image|Glenrowan shootout.jpg|700px|The gang and police exchange gunfire. Drawing by [[Tom Carrington (illustrator)|Tom Carrington]], one of several journalists present during the battle.}}\n\nThe police and the gang fired at each other for about a quarter of an hour. During a lull, Superintendent Hare returned to the railway station with a shattered left wrist from one of the first shots fired. He bled profusely, and [[Tom Carrington (illustrator)|Tom Carrington]], artist for the ''[[Australasian Sketcher with Pen and Pencil|Australasian Sketcher]]'', used his handkerchief to compress the wound. Hare then ordered O'Connor and his men to surround the hotel, and later attempted to return to battle, but gradually lost so much blood that he had to be sent to Benalla for treatment. \n\nThe Royal Commission found that Ned Kelly having retreated into the hotel after the first volley almost certainly walked out the back door for about 150 metres leading his horse. At about 100 metres he dropped his rifle and continued where he lay down behind a log until just after 7 am in the morning.\n\nThe police, trackers and civilian volunteers surrounded the hotel throughout the night, and the firing continued intermittently. At about 5 am, nine reinforcements under Superintendent Sadleir arrived from Benalla, followed soon after by Sergeant Steele, of [[Wangaratta]], with six more policemen, for a total of about 30 men. Around this stage, Byrne made a toast while drinking whiskey at the bar, saying, \"Many more years in the bush for the Kelly gang!\" Moments later, a stray bullet passed through a small gap in his armour and severed his [[femoral artery]], and he bled out within minutes. Before daylight, Senior-Constable Kelly found a revolving rifle and a silk cap lying in the bush, about 100 yards from the hotel. The rifle was covered with blood and a pool of blood lay near it. They believed it to belong to one of the bushrangers, hinting that they had escaped. They proved to be those of Ned Kelly himself. At daybreak, the women and children among the hostages were allowed to depart. They were challenged as they approached the police line, to ensure that the outlaws were not attempting to escape in disguise.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Last stand and capture===\n[[File:A strange apparition Ned Kelly's last stand.jpg|thumb|left|\"A strange apparition\": when Kelly appeared out of the mist-shrouded bush, clad in armour, bewildered policemen took him to be a ghost, a [[bunyip]], and \"[[Satan|Old Nick]] himself\".]]\nIn the dim light of dawn, Kelly, dressed in his armour and armed with three handguns, rose out of the bush and attacked the police from their rear.{{sfn|Kieza|2017|pp=412\u2013413}} Several members of the scattered police line returned fire but to no effect as Kelly moved steadily through the morning mist towards the hotel, his armour repelling bullets.

At 10 am, a white flag or handkerchief was held out at the front door, and immediately afterwards about 30 male hostages emerged, while Dan and Hart defended the back door.

Unwilling to allow his men to storm the hotel, Superintendent Sadleir telegraphed to Melbourne for an artillery cannon to be sent up by special train to obliterate the outlaws.
