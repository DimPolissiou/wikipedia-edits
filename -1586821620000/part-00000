The character was portrayed by actor [[Jo Weil]] from 31 December 1999 to 3 September 2002 and again since 2 November 2007.<ref>[http://www.deutsche-dailys.de/verbotene_liebe/rolle.php?profilname=oliver First/last appearance and date of return]</ref>\n\n== Character's background ==\nOliver is the nephew of [[Charlie Schneider]] ([[Gabriele Metzger]]) and cousin of [[Olivia Schneider|Olivia]] ([[Kristina D\u00f6rfer]]). His mother, Henriette is in bad terms with Charlie and has kept her away from Oliver during his childhood. It was mentioned once that he has a younger brother.\n\nOliver is disowned by his mother when she discovers his relationship with another man, Tom Seifert (played by Kay B\u00f6ger) and was supported by his aunt Charlie since. At the end of this relationship, he leaves D\u00fcsseldorf to work as a steward. Five years later, Oliver returns to the show, reuniting with Charlie and moving into a flat-share with [[Coco Faber]] ([[Mariangela Seclsi]]) and her boyfriend [[Christian Mann]] ([[Thore Sch\u00f6lermann]]). Due to problems in her relationship with Christian, Coco ends up kissing Oliver and develops feelings for him. However, after spending time with him on a camping trip, Oliver finds himself falling in love with Christian. Oliver goes on to find himself torn by his feelings for Christian, knowing he is straight and with a woman.\n\nAfter Christian discovers Coco and Oliver's kiss, an angry confrontation at the boxing club prompts Oliver to kiss him and finally confess his feelings. However, Christian rejects Oliver by claiming he is straight. Despite this, Christian becomes confused about his sexuality and breaks up with Coco, but isn't willing to admit he has developed feelings for Oliver too. Later, Oliver chats with a man who is confused about his sexuality, unaware that it's actually Christian. When the truth comes out, their confrontation leads to them having sex for the first time, but afterwards Christian claims that he was only testing his sexuality. However, when he sees Oliver dancing with another guy at a party, he can't hide his jealousy and admits his feelings for Oliver and they start a relationship.\n\nOliver supports Christian's boxing aspirations, hiding their relationship from his manager and from the public despite Christian's regular claims that he just wants to come out loud and proud. But Oliver refuses to let him do so, aware of how the boxing world will see Christian as a gay and how coming out so soon will likely end his career as a boxer before it can even begin. He even endures regular harassment from Axel, a homophobic fighter who is the main competitor of Christian. After Christian wins his first professional fight against Axel, he comes out by kissing Oliver in the ring. After the celebration, Oliver is brutally attacked by Axel and despite being dismissed as healthy at the hospital, a few days later he suffers a brain hemorrhage as a consequence of the attack and undergoes brain surgery to save his life.\n\nThe next hard test of their relationship comes from Rob, a successful party planner that bonds with Oliver by planning events at Oliver's bar, No Limits, while secretly attempting to use it as a drug dealing joint. At the same time, he attempts to seduce Oliver, who dismisses Christian's suspicion about Rob as mere jealousy. Christian attempts to prove Oliver that he's right about Rob. But Oliver refuses to believe it, even when NoLimits gets raided by the police when being tipped off by any anonymous call that someone witnessed drugs being exchanged there, Oliver even believes Christian set the whole thing up, much to Christian's anger and frustration. At the same time, Oliver starts to doubt that Christian is really attracted to him and begins suspecting that he's into women again, this being fueled when [[Rebecca von Lahnstein]] falls in love with Christian and eventually kisses him and Christian's drunken kiss with Miriam sometime prior to it. Oliver soon asks him, bluntly, if he's into women again, causing them to consider a break up. However, after considering all the hard times they have endured together, the two decide to try fresh this time. At the end, Rebecca exposes Rob to the police, who gets arrested, and Oliver and Christian make amends thanks to a romantic trip to New York.\n\nChristian, a little while after their trip to New York, suffers an episode of chest pain and is taken to the hospital by Andi. However, when he rushes to the hospital to learn how he is doing, Oliver is not allowed to know any details about Christian's condition as he's not a relative. When Christian goes to Sebastian von Lahnstein to file documents to fix any future health concerns for them hospital-wise as a couple, Miriam suggests marriage to Oliver as an easy fix who responds with excitement to propose to Christian and begins making plans for a romantic proposal. Oliver decorates No Limits in Valentine's Day decorations and proposes to Christian later on during the night, leaving Christian clearly shocked. He then says yes to Oliver's proposal. The two go on to start making plans for their wedding and despite having different views on a wedding - Christian wanting a small and private wedding whereas Oliver wants it to be a very big public deal, the two learn to compromise for each other.\n\nOliver's happiness with Christian is cut short by the sudden appearance of his ex-boyfriend Jonas, who comes to tell Oliver that he is HIV-positive and admits that he was sure he had the disease back when they were together. Oliver becomes scared he may have contracted the disease as well and later admits the dilemma to Christian. Christian tries to assure him that if he and Jonas used a condom then he may not have contracted it, but Oliver reveals it was a one-night stand and they were both drunk. Oliver then brings up the possibility to Christian that if he indeed contracted the disease, then he may have passed it on to him during their time together. The two then get Oliver tested to find out the results. After anxiously waiting, the doctor soon confirms that Oliver doesn't have HIV, much to his and Christian's relief. The two return home and while sitting in the hallway happily, Christian proposes to Oliver himself by declaring that the day proved to him even more that he never wants to lose him and that he wants to get married \"sooner rather than later\". Oliver and him then decide on 4 weeks from that day to get married.\n\nOn September 2010, Oliver marries Christian on a church wedding and is more than happy to be with the man he loves. After Christian comes back after a short trip with Gregor and looking after his brother's children, Christian declares he wants to have a child much to Oliver's happiness. After a failed attempt of adoption, and a failed attempt at having a child with a lesbian couple who want a rigorous schedule with the child, the two act as foster parents for a Cameroonese girl. The strain of losing her after her father takes her back to Cameroon damages their relationship, and a fight leads to Christian partying with Jessica Stiehl, who later claims both of them had sex. This triggers again Oliver's doubts about Christian's attraction to him, and calls for a break on the relationship, making Christian move out and distracting himself from his pain by partying.\n\nOliver then suffers another deep blow after witnessing Phillip zu Hohenfelden being hit by a car while he stopped on mid-street to greet Olli, being struck with guilt by thinking he made Phillip to stop, thus causing the accident. Guilt ridden, he shuts himself in his apartment for several days. Christian later has sex with a female coworker, adding another trouble to their relationship. After coming out of his depression, Oliver models for a publicity campaign and starts a fling with Rafael, a young man he met on Majorca during a vacation. After finally giving up on Christian, he begins a happy relationship with Rafael.\n\nHe and Christian soon agree to divorce, but later afterwards, Oliver hears from a horrified Andi that he's just been told that Christian is at the boxing ring battling against a friend of Axel's. Fearing for Christian due to his heart condition, he quickly goes to the boxing ring and arrives in time to witness Christian suffer a heart attack and collapse. The shock of truly losing Christian causes Oliver to realize that, despite all his doubts and the trouble, he still loves him. After the paramedics make several failed attempts to restart Christian's heart, Oliver believes Christian has died and leaves the boxing ring in a daze, unaware of Christian's heart starting back up again successfully as he leaves. Oliver returns home and breaks up with Rafael, telling him that all they had was an affair and that he doesn't love him. He explains that he truly loves Christian, informing him of his assumed death. Oliver wanders around the city for a bit before running into an escaped hospital patient in the same area, who tells him that she is there because she can feel her deceased husband's love there the most. He returns her to the hospital before being informed that Christian is indeed the hospital, initially thinking he is in the morgue, but is told that he is actually in intensive care and alive. Oliver immediately goes to Christian to see him and confesses that he still loves him and wants to be with him for the rest of his life. The two tenderly and happily reunite.\n\nOn 3 January 2012 Oliver and Christian get married for a second time in the cabin outside in which they first fell in love. On June 2012, Oliver loses his bar license after he unadvertedly serves alcohol to minors during a party, and he ends up selling the name rights of No Limits to [[Tristan von Lahnstein|Tristan]] and [[Marlene Wolf|Marlene]], who launch a new No Limits, keeping Olli as a manager. At the same time, he begins working as a model for [[Tanja von Lahnstein]]. On October 2012, he discovers evidence (left to him by Arno Brandner in a letter written shortly before his death) that he has a long-lost sister, and tracks her down. She is revealed to be named Bella Jacob and lives on the city of [[T\u00fcbingen]], unaware that she's adopted.\n\nIn late 2012, Christian takes a job in England and the couple agrees to have a long distance relationship, parting ways with a sweet kiss. In September 2013 Christian returns and the couple spends many joyful moments. However, Christian announces that he has renewed his England contract for an extra year, causing friction between the two before, through misunderstanding a hospital situation when Christian gets his coat mugged and is mistaken for a critically injured person, the two make up. Despite this, their situation once again becomes wedged when Christian admits to have cheated once again with a woman during a drunken one night stand while in England, much to Oliver's devastation. Despite later returning and claiming to want an open marriage to teach Christian a lesson, when an opportunity arises to sleep with a man, Oliver is unable to go through with it. He simply begins ignoring and distancing himself from Christian, who is regularly begging for forgiveness.\n\nWhen Christian finally believes it is truly over between them, he books a flight for England and prepares to leave after one last failed attempt to talk with Oliver who once again ignores him. Jessica, who is watching from the hallway, becomes exasperated with the two and locks the couple inside their room together to force them to talk, saying she'll be back from work in several hours. During this time period, Christian convinces Oliver he is truly sorry. Eventually, Oliver requests all the details of his one-night stand, saying it may make him able to forgive again. When Christian admits he doesn't remember due to being drunk the entire time, he insists nobody will ever compare to being with him because he loves him. Oliver finally forgives him and the couple make up. Oliver then agrees to go to England with Christian for a short period in order to rebuild their relationship together.\n\nThen, after months of long-distance relationship, Oliver was under the influence of alcohol and had a one-night stand with another man. Oliver later phone Christian then flew over to see him in London. Only to come home with news of their divorce.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Verbotene Liebe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sabel, Oliver}}\n[[Category:Verbotene Liebe characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional gay males]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1999]]\n[[Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{long plot|date=July 2018}}\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2018}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Oliver Sabel\n| series         = Verbotene Liebe\n| portrayer      = '''[[Jo Weil]]'''\n| years          = 1999-2002, 2007-2015\n| first          = Episode 1188<br>31 December 1999\n| last           =  Episode 4649<br>6 February 2015\n| cause          = \n| creator        = \n| image1         = File:OliverSabel.jpg|210px\n| caption1       = [[Jo Weil]] as Oliver Sabel\n| nickname       = Olli\n| alias          = \n| gender         = Male\n| born           = <!--Note: Do not name a date without a source that can prove the information -->\n| death          = \n| death cause    = \n| age            = \n| occupation     = Co-owner of the No Limits with [[Christian Mann]] <br>Former waiter at the bistro Schneiders<br>Former student for psychology\n| title          = \n| residence      = Flat-share<br>[[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[Germany]]\n| parents        = [[Verbotene Liebe minor characters#Henriette Sabel|Henriette Sabel]]<br>(mother)<br>Wolfgang Sabel <br>(father)\n| siblings       = Unknown<br>(brother)<br>[[Bella Jacob]]<br>(paternal half-sister)\n| spouse         = [[Christian Mann]]<br> (divorced) [2010-2011] <br>  [2012- ] \n| romances       = Tom Seifert<br>Jule Roth<br>[[Verbotene Liebe minor characters#Kitty K\u00fcbler|Kitty K\u00fcbler]]<br>Timo Sattler<br>Coco Faber<br>[[Christian Mann]]<br>[[Rafael Velasquez]]\n| children       = nil\n| grandchildren  = \n| grandparents   = Lily Snyder - Holden Snyder (paternal) - Winston Mayer - Cheri Mayer (maternal)\n| aunts/uncles   = [[Charlie Schneider]]<br>(maternal)<br>Thomas Schneider<br>(maternal)<br>[[Lars Schneider]]<br>(maternal)\n| nieces/nephews =\n| cousins        = [[Olivia Schneider]]<br>(deceased, via Thomas)<br>[[Bella Jacob]]<br>(via Charlie)<br>[[The Lahnstein Family#Grandchildren|Sophia von Lahnstein]]<br>(via Lars)\n| relatives      = \n}}\n\n'''Oliver Sabel''' is a popular [[fictional character]] in the [[Germany|German]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Verbotene Liebe]] (Forbidden Love : in English)''. The character is portrayed by actor [[Jo Weil]] from 31 December 1999 to 3 September 2002 and again since 2 November 2007.<ref>[http://www.deutsche-dailys.de/verbotene_liebe/rolle.php?profilname=oliver First/last appearance and date of return]</ref>\n\n== Character's background ==\nOliver is the nephew of [[Charlie Schneider]] ([[Gabriele Metzger]]) and cousin of [[Olivia Schneider|Olivia]] ([[Kristina D\u00f6rfer]]). His mother, Henriette is in bad terms with Charlie and has kept her away from Oliver during his childhood. It was mentioned once that he has a younger brother.\n\nOliver is disowned by his mother when she discovers his relationship with another man, Tom Seifert (played by Kay B\u00f6ger) and was supported by his aunt Charlie since. At the end of this relationship, he leaves D\u00fcsseldorf to work as a steward. Five years later, Oliver returns to the show, reuniting with Charlie and moving into a flat-share with [[Coco Faber]] ([[Mariangela Seclsi]]) and her boyfriend [[Christian Mann]] ([[Thore Sch\u00f6lermann]]). Due to problems in her relationship with Christian, Coco ends up kissing Oliver and develops feelings for him. However, after spending time with him on a camping trip, Oliver finds himself falling in love with Christian. Oliver goes on to find himself torn by his feelings for Christian, knowing he is straight and with a woman.\n\nAfter Christian discovers Coco and Oliver's kiss, an angry confrontation at the boxing club prompts Oliver to kiss him and finally confess his feelings. However, Christian rejects Oliver by claiming he is straight. Despite this, Christian becomes confused about his sexuality and breaks up with Coco, but isn't willing to admit he has developed feelings for Oliver too. Later, Oliver chats with a man who is confused about his sexuality, unaware that it's actually Christian. When the truth comes out, their confrontation leads to them having sex for the first time, but afterwards Christian claims that he was only testing his sexuality. However, when he sees Oliver dancing with another guy at a party, he can't hide his jealousy and admits his feelings for Oliver and they start a relationship.\n\nOliver supports Christian's boxing aspirations, hiding their relationship from his manager and from the public despite Christian's regular claims that he just wants to come out loud and proud. But Oliver refuses to let him do so, aware of how the boxing world will see Christian as a gay and how coming out so soon will likely end his career as a boxer before it can even begin. He even endures regular harassment from Axel, a homophobic fighter who is the main competitor of Christian. After Christian wins his first professional fight against Axel, he comes out by kissing Oliver in the ring. After the celebration, Oliver is brutally attacked by Axel and despite being dismissed as healthy at the hospital, a few days later he suffers a brain hemorrage as a consequence of the attack and undergoes brain surgery to save his life.\n\nThe next hard test of their relationship comes from Rob, a successful party planner that bonds with Oliver by planning events at Oliver's bar, No Limits, while secretly attempting to use it as a drug dealing joint. At the same time, he attempts to seduce Oliver, who dismisses Christian's suspicion about Rob as mere jealousy. Christian attempts to prove Oliver that he's right about Rob. But Oliver refuses to believe it, even when NoLimits gets raided by the police when being tipped off by any anonymous call that someone witnessed drugs being exchanged there, Oliver even believes Christian set the whole thing up, much to Christian's anger and frustration. At the same time, Oliver starts to doubt that Christian is really attracted to him and begins suspecting that he's into women again, this being fueled when [[Rebecca von Lahnstein]] falls in love with Christian and eventually kisses him and Christian's drunken kiss with Miriam sometime prior to it. Oliver soon asks him, bluntly, if he's into women again, causing them to consider a break up. However, after considering all the hard times they have endured together, the two decide to try fresh this time. At the end, Rebecca exposes Rob to the police, who gets arrested, and Oliver and Christian make amends thanks to a romantic trip to New York.\n\nChristian, a little while after their trip to New York, suffers an episode of chest pain and is taken to the hospital by Andi. However, when he rushes to the hospital to learn how he is doing, Oliver is not allowed to know any details about Christian's condition as he's not a relative. When Christian goes to Sebastian von Lahnstein to file documents to fix any future health concerns for them hospital-wise as a couple, Miriam suggests marriage to Oliver as an easy fix who responds with excitement to propose to Christian and begins making plans for a romantic proposal. Oliver decorates No Limits in Valentine's Day decorations and proposes to Christian later on during the night, leaving Christian clearly shocked. He then says yes to Oliver's proposal. The two go on to start making plans for their wedding and despite having different views on a wedding - Christian wanting a small and private wedding whereas Oliver wants it to be a very big public deal, the two learn to compromise for each other.\n\nOliver's happiness with Christian is cut short by the sudden appearance of his ex-boyfriend Jonas, who comes to tell Oliver that he is HIV-positive and admits that he was sure he had the disease back when they were together. Oliver becomes scared he may have contracted the disease as well and later admits the dilemma to Christian. Christian tries to assure him that if he and Jonas used a condom then he may not have contracted it, but Oliver reveals it was a one-night stand and they were both drunk. Oliver then brings up the possibility to Christian that if he indeed contracted the disease, then he may have passed it on to him during their time together. The two then get Oliver tested to find out the results. After anxiously waiting, the doctor soon confirms that Oliver doesn't have HIV, much to his and Christian's relief. The two return home and while sitting in the hallway happily, Christian proposes to Oliver himself by declaring that the day proved to him even more that he never wants to lose him and that he wants to get married \"sooner rather than later\". Oliver and him then decide on 4 weeks from that day to get married.\n\nOn September 2010, Oliver marries Christian on a church wedding and is more than happy to be with the man he loves. After Christian comes back after a short trip with Gregor and looking after his brother's children, Christian declares he wants to have a child much to Oliver's happiness. After a failed attempt of adoption, and a failed attempt at having a child with a lesbian couple who want a rigorous schedule with the child, the two act as foster parents for a Cameroonese girl. The strain of losing her after her father takes her back to Cameroon damages their relationship, and a fight leads to Christian partying with Jessica Stiehl, who later claims both of them had sex. This triggers again Oliver's doubts about Christian's attraction to him, and calls for a break on the relationship, making Christian move out and distracting himself from his pain by partying.\n\nOliver then suffers another deep blow after witnessing Phillip zu Hohenfelden being hit by a car while he stopped on mid-street to greet Olli, being struck with guilt by thinking he made Phillip to stop, thus causing the accident. Guilt ridden, he shuts himself in his apartment for several days. Christian later has sex with a female coworker, adding another trouble to their relationship. After coming out of his depression, Oliver models for a publicity campaign and starts a fling with Rafael, a young man he met on Majorca during a vacation. After finally giving up on Christian, he begins a happy relationship with Rafael.\n\nHe and Christian soon agree to divorce, but later afterwards, Oliver hears from a horrified Andi that he's just been told that Christian is at the boxing ring battling against a friend of Axel's. Fearing for Christian due to his heart condition, he quickly goes to the boxing ring and arrives in time to witness Christian suffer a heart attack and collapse. The shock of truly losing Christian causes Oliver to realize that, despite all his doubts and the trouble, he still loves him. After the paramedics make several failed attempts to restart Christian's heart, Oliver believes Christian has died and leaves the boxing ring in a daze, unaware of Christian's heart starting back up again successfully as he leaves. Oliver returns home and breaks up with Rafael, telling him that all they had was an affair and that he doesn't love him. He explains that he truly loves Christian, informing him of his assumed death. Oliver wanders around the city for a bit before running into an escaped hospital patient in the same area, who tells him that she is there because she can feel her deceased husband's love there the most.

At {{convert|1063|ft}} altitude, the highest elevation in Bangladesh is Saka Haphong at Mowdok range, in the southeastern part of the hills. Highly elevated peaks of this area can also be called mountains as hills above {{convert|2000|ft}} with a distinct peak are referred as mountains. Seventy-five such mountains have been identified and mapped in the Hill Tracts.<ref>Mountains of Bangladesh (Map) 2015, ''[http://mapsnmaps.blogspot.com/2015/02/modowk-taung-is-highest-mountain-of.html]''</ref> Fertile valleys lie between the hill lines, which generally run north\u2013south. West of the Chittagong Hills is a broad plain, cut by rivers draining into the Bay of Bengal, that rises to a final chain of low coastal hills, mostly below 200 m, that attain a maximum elevation of 350 m. West of these hills is a narrow, wet coastal plain located between the cities of Chittagong in the north and Cox's Bazar in the south.\n\n==Saka Haphong==\n[[File:Saka Haphong.jpg|thumbnail|180px|Saka Haphong]]\n\n{{Main|Saka Haphong}}\n\nUnofficially the highest peak of Bangladesh is Saka Haphong at Mowdok range.<ref>Bao-Rong Lu, Generai information of the areas visited and the collecting routes, ''[http://www.irri.org/GRC/Biodiversity/Pdf%20files/BGD%20pdf/bgd3.pdf A Report On BRRI-IRRI Cooperative Collection of Wild Oryza Species In Bangladesh] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813132803/http://www.irri.org/GRC/Biodiversity/Pdf%20files/BGD%20pdf/bgd3.pdf |date=2006-08-13 }}'', page 5, [[International Rice Research Institute]], October 1529, 1998</ref><ref>[http://highpointguides.com/catalog/index.php?manufacturers_id=10&osCsid=8c8694c8a089ad05118870df688a00ff Country-wise highest points], HighPoint.com</ref> on the border with [[Myanmar]]. In February 2006 a GPS reading of 1,064 meters was recorded on this summit by English adventurer Ginge Fullen. The location he recorded, {{coord|21|47|11|N|92|36|36|E}}, accurately matches the location given by Russian topographic mapping and [[SRTM]] data, although these sources show its height to be slightly lower, at 1,052 meters. However, SRTM data has been demonstrated to have about 5-9m vertical accuracy, while most tracking grade handheld GPS receivers also have several meters of vertical inaccuracy. Only accurate DGPS or RTK-GPS survey, or airborne LIDAR/photogrammetric survey can yield more accurate result. Recently two trekking clubs counted the height of \"Saka Haphong\" as 3,488 and 3,461 feet, respectively. Any of these two figure would make it the highest mountain in Bangladesh exceeding the height of Keokaradong, which is 3,172 feet high.<ref name=\"HighMountain\">[http://thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=175791 'Second highest hill' spotted by 4 Youths] The Daily Star, 28 February 2011</ref>\nThis peak is also known as Mowdok Taung (as per USGS Topo and Russian Topo map), Saka Haphong (by local Tripura tribes). Mowdok Taung was the official name that appeared in all British India topographic maps of 1938, 1939 and 1948 which is also reflected in US Army Corps of Engineers Map of 1954. Because no name change notification by the governments of India till 1947, government of Pakistan till 1971 or the Government of Bangladesh afterward was found anywhere, 'Mowdok Taung' still presumably remains as the official and the most authentic name for this peak.

In Bawm language the term Zow means Mizo (Mizo is derived from Mizoram, India. Probable reason is that Bangladesh was a part of greater India before 1947) and Tlang means Mountain. According to American and Russian topographic maps Zow Tlang is mentioned as Mowdok Mual. As per [https://web.archive.org/web/20190109100320/http://www.banglatrek.org/ Bangla Trek], it is the second-highest peak of the country; though it is not officially recognized by the government till date.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.banglatrek.org/?page_id=40 |title=List of peaks in Bangladesh |website=Banglatrek |accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref> Many accomplished local adventurers describe this as one of the most wildest peak of Bangladesh.\n\nThe peak was first summitted in 2005 by two Bangladeshi adventurers, Subrata Das Nitish and Bijoy Shankar Kar. The same team summitted the mountain again in 2007. The altitude couldn't be measured in these two expeditions as the team wasn't carrying any GPS device. On January 12, 2012, the peak was summitted for the third time by the Bangla Trek team members Tashdid Rezwan Mugdho, Tarikul Alom Sujon, Salehin Arshady and SM Mainul. Measured altitude and Geo location of the peak by their Garmin eTrex 20 was 1021.69 meter and 21\u00b040'23.78\u2033N & 92\u00b036'16.01\u2033E.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.banglatrek.org/?p=983 |title=Zow Tlang/Mowdok Mual |website=Banglatrek |accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref> Two of the team members, Mugdho and Sujon died in a tragic bus accident on their way back to Bandarban after the expedition. The other two members, Salehin and Mainul suffered serious injuries and it took them a long time to recover.\n\nOn October 13, 2013, a team led by Shahzaman Chowdhury Hira became the third team to summit the peak at 1400 hrs. This team was having 6 members - Sharfaraj Hussain Jony, Sidratul Afia Mohona, Mahbubur Rahman, Abdullah Anas Oni and Baqui Billah Milon.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.panoramio.com/photo/116174483 |title=Zow Tlang (Mowdok Mual) as seen from the nearest mountain village Dowlian Para |website=Panoramio}}</ref> Member of this team Mohona was the first woman ever to summit this very peak.

It is the highest peak of Rangamati hill district and also the one of only three 1000 meters peaks in Bangladesh. In 2014, several teams have summitted Zow Tlang and based on their readings it can be said that Dumlong is the third-highest peak of the country.\n\n==Keokradong==\n[[File:Keokradong.jpg|thumbnail|180px|Eastern face of Keokradong]]\n\n{{main|Keokradong}}\n\nAlthough it is widely reported to be the highest point in Bangladesh at 1,230 meters,<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2020.html CIA: the World Factbook]</ref> recent SRTM data, [[GPS]] readings and Russian topographic mapping show that its true height is less than 1,000 meters.\n\nOn the top of Keokradong there is a small shelter and a signboard put up by the Bangladeshi military proclaiming the altitude to be 3172 feet.

However, SRTM data has been demonstrated to have about 5-9m vertical accuracy, while most tracking grade handheld GPS receivers also have several meters of vertical inaccuracy. Only accurate DGPS or RTK-GPS survey, or airborne LIDAR/photogrammetric survey can yield more accurate result. Recently two trekking clubs counted the height of \"Saka Haphong\" as 3,488 and 3,461 feet, respectively.

Mowdok Taung was the official name that appeared in all British India topographic maps of 1938, 1939 and 1948 which is also reflected in US Army Corps of Engineers Map of 1954. Because no name change notification by the governments of India till 1947, government of Pakistan till 1971 or the Government of Bangladesh afterward was found anywhere, 'Mowdok Taung' still presumably remains as the official and the most authentic name for this peak.

In Bawm language the term Zow means Mizo (Mizo is derived from Mizoram, India. Probable reason is that Bangladesh was a part of greater India before 1947) and Tlang means Mountain. According to American and Russian topographic maps Zow Tlang is mentioned as Mowdok Mual.

The same team summitted the mountain again in 2007. The altitude couldn't be measured in these two expeditions as the team wasn't carrying any GPS device. On January 12, 2012, the peak was summitted for the third time by the Bangla Trek team members Tashdid Rezwan Mugdho, Tarikul Alom Sujon, Salehin Arshady and SM Mainul. Measured altitude and Geo location of the peak by their Garmin eTrex 20 was 1021.69 meter and 21\u00b040'23.78\u2033N & 92\u00b036'16.01\u2033E.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.banglatrek.org/?p=983 |title=Zow Tlang/Mowdok Mual |website=Banglatrek |accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref> Two of the team members, Mugdho and Sujon died in a tragic bus accident on their way back to Bandarban after the expedition. The other two members, Salehin and Mainul suffered serious injuries and it took them a long time to recover.\n\nOn October 13, 2013, a team led by Shahzaman Chowdhury Hira became the third team to summit the peak at 1400 hrs.

The video also thanks his fans for sticking with him through his YouTube career, referencing past notable videos.<ref name=\"CongratsDexerto\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/watch-pewdiepie-roast-t-series-epic-new-congratulations-diss-track-504410 |title=Watch PewDiePie roast T-Series with epic new 'Congratulations' diss track |last=Glaze |first=Virginia |date=31 March 2019 |website=dexerto.com}}</ref><ref name=\"polygon\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/31/18275692/pewdiepie-tseries-feud-concession-diss-track |title=PewDiePie admits defeat to T-Series |last=Radulovic |first=Petrana |date=31 March 2019 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref><ref name=\"theverge\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/31/18289617/pewdiepie-tseries-congratulations-subscribe-youtube-diss-track-100-million |title=PewDiePie concedes to T-Series in battle for YouTube\u2019s biggest channel |last=Alexander |first=Julia |date=31 March 2019 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref name=\"bbc\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47042761 |title=PewDiePie concedes defeat to YouTube rival T-Series |date=1 April 2019 |work=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nThe day after the song was uploaded to YouTube, PewDiePie regained his lead against T-Series.<ref name=Tobin2019>{{cite web|last=Tobin|first=Ben|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/04/02/pewdiepie-back-top-biggest-youtube-channel-over-t-series/3339914002/|title=PewDiePie back on top as largest YouTube channel over Indian music label T-Series|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2 April 2019|accessdate=3 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404024138/https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/04/02/pewdiepie-back-top-biggest-youtube-channel-over-t-series/3339914002/|archive-date=4 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Eight days after the release of \"Congratulations,\" both music videos were banned in India when the [[Delhi High Court]] granted an injunction in favor of T-Series.<ref name=\"DissTracksBanned1\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.medianama.com/2019/04/223-delhi-high-court-orders-youtube-to-remove-pewdiepie-diss-tracks-on-t-series/ |title=Delhi High Court orders YouTube to remove PewDiePie \"diss tracks\" on T-Series |last=Babele |first=Aryan |date=12 April 2019 |website=Medianama |access-date=13 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"DissTracksBanned2\">{{Cite web |url=https://roguerocket.com/2019/04/15/pewdiepies-t-series-diss-tracks-banned-in-india/ |title=PewDiePie\u2019s T-Series Diss Tracks Banned in India |last=Stenn |first=Lili |date=15 April 2019 |website=Rogue Rocket |access-date=13 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"DissTracksBanned3\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2019/04/11/india-v-pewdiepie/ |title=India Clamps Down on PewDiePie Racism \u2014 High Court Orders YouTube to Remove Two Offensive Videos |last=Sanchz |first=Daniel |date=11 April 2019 |website=Digital Music News |access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 October 2019, following PewDiePie's surpassing 100 million subscribers and a few months of Minecraft gameplay videos, PewDiePie released \"Mine All Day (Minecraft music video)\".
