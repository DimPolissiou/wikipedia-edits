The earliest evidence of horses [[equestrianism|ridden]] in warfare dates from [[Eurasia]] between 4000 and 3000&nbsp;BC. A [[Sumer]]ian illustration of warfare from 2500&nbsp;BC depicts some type of [[equidae|equine]] pulling wagons. By 1600&nbsp;BC, improved [[horse harness|harness]] and [[chariot]] designs made chariot warfare common throughout the [[Ancient Near East]], and the earliest written training manual for war horses was a guide for training chariot horses written about 1350&nbsp;BC. As formal [[cavalry tactics]] replaced the chariot, so did new training methods, and by 360&nbsp;BC, the Greek cavalry officer [[Xenophon]] had written an extensive treatiseon horsemanship. The effectiveness of horses in battle was also revolutionized by improvements in [[technology]], including the invention of the [[saddle]], the [[stirrup]], and later, the [[horse collar]].\n\nMany different types and sizes of horse were used in war, depending on the form of warfare. The type used varied with whether the horse was being ridden or driven, and whether they were being used for [[reconnaissance]], cavalry charges, [[Raid (military)|raiding]], communication, or supply. Throughout history, [[mule]]s and [[donkey]]s as well as horses played a crucial role in providing support to armies in the field.\n\nHorses were well suited to the warfare tactics of the [[nomad]]ic cultures from the [[steppe]]s of [[Central Asia]]. Several [[East Asia]]n cultures made extensive use of cavalry and chariots. [[Muslim]] warriors relied upon [[light cavalry]] in their campaigns throughout [[North Africa]], [[Asia]], and Europe beginning in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. Europeans used several types of war horses in the [[Middle Ages]], and the best-known [[heavy cavalry]] warrior of the period was the armoured [[knight]]. With the decline of the knight and rise of gunpowder in warfare, light cavalry again rose to prominence, used in both European warfare and in the conquest of the [[Americas]]. Battle cavalry developed to take on a multitude of roles in the late 18th century and early 19th century and was often crucial for victory in the [[Napoleonic wars]]. In the Americas, the use of horses and development of mounted warfare tactics were learned by several tribes of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] and in turn, highly mobile horse regiments were critical in the [[American Civil War]].\n\nHorse cavalry began to be phased out after [[World War I]] in favour of [[armoured warfare|tank warfare]], though a few horse cavalry units were still used into [[World War II]], especially as scouts. By the end of World War II, horses were seldom seen in battle, but were still used extensively for the transport of troops and supplies. Today, formal battle-ready horse cavalry units have almost disappeared, though the [[United States Army Special Forces]] used horses in battle during the [[2001 invasion of Afghanistan]].  Horses are still seen in use by organized armed fighters in [[Third World]] countries. Many nations still maintain small units of mounted riders for patrol and [[reconnaissance]], and military horse units are also used for ceremonial and educational purposes. Horses are also used for [[historical reenactment]] of battles, [[Mounted police|law enforcement]], and in [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] competitions derived from the riding and training skills once used by the military.\n\n==Types of horse used in warfare==\nA fundamental principle of [[equine conformation]] is \"form to function\". Therefore, the type of horse used for various forms of warfare depended on the work performed, the weight a horse needed to carry or pull, and distance travelled.<ref>Bennett, ''Conquerors'', p. 31.</ref> Weight affects speed and endurance, creating a trade-off: armour added protection,<ref>Krebs ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance'', p. 250.</ref> but added weight reduces maximum speed.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1198889,00.html|title=Bred for Speed&nbsp;...

In some situations, one primary type of horse was favoured over all others.<ref>Edwards, G., ''The Arabian'', p. 19.</ref> In other places, multiple types were needed; warriors would travel to battle riding a lighter horse of greater speed and endurance, and then switch to a heavier horse, with greater weight-carrying capacity, when wearing heavy armour in actual combat.<ref name=NicolleCK14>Nicolle, ''Crusader Knight'', p. 14.</ref>\n\nThe average horse can carry up to approximately 30% of its body weight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aerc.org/AERC_Rider_Handbook110303.asp|title=Chapter 3, Section IV: Size|author=American Endurance Ride Conference|accessdate=2008-08-07|date=November 2003|work=Endurance Rider's Handbook|publisher=AERC|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515133147/http://www.aerc.org/AERC_Rider_Handbook110303.asp|archivedate=2008-05-15}}</ref> While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors.<ref>Baker, ''A Treatise on Roads and Pavements'', pp. 22\u201323.</ref><ref name=\"Cotner1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://horsepullresults.com/LacledeCountyFairgroundsarticle.asp |title=Mighty horses pull more than their weight at fair |author=Luthy, Dusty |accessdate=2008-08-08 |work=The Lebanon Daily Record |publisher=Horsepull Results |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517034841/http://horsepullresults.com/LacledeCountyFairgroundsarticle.asp |archivedate=2008-05-17 }}</ref> Horses [[horse harness|harnessed]] to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight,<ref name=dynamometer>{{cite web|url=http://www.easterndrafthorse.com/History/historydyn.htm|title= History of the draft horse dynamometer machine|author=Eastern Draft Horse Association|work=History|publisher=Eastern Draft horse Association|accessdate=2008-07-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080609233345/http://www.easterndrafthorse.com/History/historydyn.htm |archivedate = June 9, 2008}}</ref> but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.easterndrafthorse.com/Rules/EDHARules.htm |title=Eastern Draft Horse Association Rules|author=Eastern Draft Horse Association|work=History|publisher=Eastern Draft horse Association|accessdate=2008-07-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080609233413/http://www.easterndrafthorse.com/Rules/EDHARules.htm |archivedate = June 9, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horsepull.com/Record%20Loads.htm |title=Records |author=Horsepull.com |publisher=Horsepull.com |accessdate=2008-08-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915143907/http://www.horsepull.com/Record%20Loads.htm |archivedate=2008-09-15 }}</ref> Thus, horses that were [[driving (horse)|driven]] varied in size and had to make a trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals.

Medium-weight horses had the greatest range in size, from about {{hands|14.2}} but stocky,<ref name=\"Edwards11ff\"/><ref name=\"Hyland85\"/> to as much as {{hands|16}},<ref>Gravett, ''English Medieval Knight 1300\u20131400'', p. 59.</ref> weighing approximately {{convert|1000|to|1200|lb|kg|order=flip}}.

The earliest evidence of horses [[equestrianism|ridden]] in warfare dates from [[Eurasia]] between 4000 and 3000&nbsp;BC. A [[Sumer]]ian illustration of warfare from 2500&nbsp;BC depicts some type of [[equidae|equine]] pulling wagons. By 1600&nbsp;BC, improved [[horse harness|harness]] and [[chariot]] designs made chariot warfare common throughout the [[Ancient Near East]], and the earliest written training manual for war horses was a guide for training chariot horses written about 1350&nbsp;BC. As formal [[cavalry tactics]] replaced the chariot, so did new training methods, and by 360&nbsp;BC, the Greek cavalry officer [[Xenophon]] had written an extensive treatise on horsemanship. The effectiveness of horses in battle was also revolutionized by improvements in [[technology]], including the invention of the [[saddle]], the [[stirrup]], and later, the [[horse collar]].\n\nMany different types and sizes of horse were used in war, depending on the form of warfare. The type used varied with whether the horse was being ridden or driven, and whether they were being used for [[reconnaissance]], cavalry charges, [[Raid (military)|raiding]], communication, or supply. Throughout history, [[mule]]s and [[donkey]]s as well as horses played a crucial role in providing support to armies in the field.\n\nHorses were well suited to the warfare tactics of the [[nomad]]ic cultures from the [[steppe]]s of [[Central Asia]]. Several [[East Asia]]n cultures made extensive use of cavalry and chariots. [[Muslim]] warriors relied upon [[light cavalry]] in their campaigns throughout [[North Africa]], [[Asia]], and Europe beginning in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. Europeans used several types of war horses in the [[Middle Ages]], and the best-known [[heavy cavalry]] warrior of the period was the armoured [[knight]]. With the decline of the knight and rise of gunpowder in warfare, light cavalry again rose to prominence, used in both European warfare and in the conquest of the [[Americas]]. Battle cavalry developed to take on a multitude of roles in the late 18th century and early 19th century and was often crucial for victory in the [[Napoleonic wars]]. In the Americas, the use of horses and development of mounted warfare tactics were learned by several tribes of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] and in turn, highly mobile horse regiments were critical in the [[American Civil War]].\n\nHorse cavalry began to be phased out after [[World War I]] in favour of [[armoured warfare|tank warfare]], though a few horse cavalry units were still used into [[World War II]], especially as scouts. By the end of World War II, horses were seldom seen in battle, but were still used extensively for the transport of troops and supplies. Today, formal battle-ready horse cavalry units have almost disappeared, though the [[United States Army Special Forces]] used horses in battle during the [[2001 invasion of Afghanistan]].  Horses are still seen in use by organized armed fighters in [[Third World]] countries. Many nations still maintain small units of mounted riders for patrol and [[reconnaissance]], and military horse units are also used for ceremonial and educational purposes. Horses are also used for [[historical reenactment]] of battles, [[Mounted police|law enforcement]], and in [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] competitions derived from the riding and training skills once used by the military.\n\n==Types of horse used in warfare==\nA fundamental principle of [[equine conformation]] is \"form to function\". Therefore, the type of horse used for various forms of warfare depended on the work performed, the weight a horse needed to carry or pull, and distance travelled.<ref>Bennett, ''Conquerors'', p. 31.</ref> Weight affects speed and endurance, creating a trade-off: armour added protection,<ref>Krebs ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance'', p. 250.</ref> but added weight reduces maximum speed.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1198889,00.html|title=Bred for Speed&nbsp;...

At first, equines, both horses and [[asinus|onagers]], were hitched to wheeled carts by means of a [[yoke]] around their necks in a manner similar to that of [[oxen]].<ref name=Pritchard>Pritchard, ''The Ancient Near East'', illustration 97.</ref> However, such a design is incompatible with [[equine anatomy]], limiting both the strength and mobility of the animal. By the time of the [[Hyksos]] invasions of [[Egypt]], c.&nbsp;1600 BC, horses were pulling chariots with an improved [[horse harness|harness]] design that made use of a [[breastplate (tack)|breastcollar]] and [[Breeching (tack)|breeching]], which allowed a horse to move faster and pull more weight.<ref name=Chamberlin102>Chamberlin, ''Horse'', pp. 102\u2013108.</ref>\n\nEven after the chariot had become obsolete as a tool of war, there still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. The invention of the [[horse collar]] in China during the 5th century AD ([[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 322\">Needham, ''Science and Civilization in China'', p. 322.</ref> The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century,<ref name=Chamberlin109>Chamberlin, ''Horse'', pp. 109\u2013110.</ref> and became widespread by the 12th century.<ref name=\"needham317\">Needham, ''Science and Civilization in China'', p. 317.</ref>\n\n===Riding equipment===\n{{Main|Saddle|Stirrup}}\n[[File:Caballo Haniwa Guimet 01.JPG|thumb|[[Haniwa]] horse statuette, complete with saddle and stirrups, 6th century, [[Kofun period]]]]\n\nTwo major innovations that revolutionised the effectiveness of mounted warriors in battle were the saddle and the stirrup.<ref name=Techniques70>Bennett and others, ''Fighting Techniques'', pp. 70, 84.</ref> Riders quickly learned to pad their horse's backs to protect themselves from the horse's spine and [[withers]], and fought on horseback for centuries with little more than a blanket or pad on the horse's back and a rudimentary bridle.

Colorado Heights University, shortened to CHU, was a nationally accredited, private university located in Denver, Colorado. More than half of students at CHU came from over 50 different countries.  \n\n==History==\nAt the end of the 19th century, Mother Pancratia (Mary Louise Bonfils 1852-1915),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.shu.edu/crra/2013/07/17/mother-pancratia-bonfils-1852-1915/|title=Mother Pancratia Bonfils (1852 \u2013 1915) \u2013 Treasures of the Catholic Research Resources Alliance (CRRA)|website=blogs.shu.edu|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref> of the [[Sisters of Loretto]], had the vision to educate women in the Rocky Mountain region. In 1886, Loretto Heights Academy was founded as a Catholic girls' high school in the building now used as Colorado Heights University's Administration Building.\n\nThe landmark Administration Building was a Romanesque six-story structure, designed by Denver architect [[Frank E. Edbrooke]] (1840-1921). The Administration Building was built from red sandstone and has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1975.<ref>[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Denver, Colorado]] - [[National Register of Historic Places listings in West Denver, Colorado]]</ref>\n\nOver the years, the school became a college and expanded to include teacher education programs, nursing programs, business, dance and more for both men and women.<ref>A more detailed history of the CHU campus from its beginning through the 1980s can be found at http://www.chu.edu/images/Section%201/1.2.1_WCHU_HistoryHeights.pdf</ref> The campus now has almost 20 structures, including a 1,000 seat theater, an interfaith chapel, a swimming pool, cafeteria, residence halls and recreational amenities.\n\nIn 1989, Teikyo Loretto Heights University (TLHU) opened on the campus of the former Loretto Heights College. TLHU focused on international students. In 2009, Colorado Heights University opened. Colorado Heights University was owned by the [[Teikyo University]] Group,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.teikyo-u.ac.jp/english/index.html|title=Teikyo University|website=www.teikyo-u.ac.jp|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref> a multinational educational foundation based in Japan that operates many undergraduate and graduate universities with more than 70,000 students spread across 46 campuses world-wide.\n\n==Academics==\nColorado Heights University focused on international business degree programs and English as a Second Language (ESL) courses. It offered Intensive English and [[Test of English as a Foreign Language]] (TOEFL) preparation certificate programs, the Bachelor of Arts in International Business, and various specializations in the Master of Business Administration in International Business.\n\n==Campus==\nIts campus had consisted of 20 buildings on a {{convert|74|acre|m2|adj=on}} site, the highest area in Denver. The Administration Building opened in 1891. Its prominent bell tower could be seen from miles around, serving as a landmark for many Denver residents.\n\n==Students==\nMost of the students at Colorado Heights University were non-traditional college students. This demographic includes international students, students who speak a language other than English as their native tongue.\n\nMost of the students at Colorado Heights University were bilingual and many are multilingual.

Colorado Heights University, shortened to CHU, was a nationally accredited, private university located in Denver, Colorado. More than half of students at CHU came from over 50 different countries.  \n\n==History==\nAt the end of the 19th century, Mother Pancratia (Mary Louise Bonfils 1852-1915),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.shu.edu/crra/2013/07/17/mother-pancratia-bonfils-1852-1915/|title=Mother Pancratia Bonfils (1852 \u2013 1915) \u2013 Treasures of the Catholic Research Resources Alliance (CRRA)|website=blogs.shu.edu|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref> of the [[Sisters of Loretto]], had the vision to educate women in the Rocky Mountain region. In 1886, Loretto Heights Academy was founded as a Catholic girls' high school in the building now used as Colorado Heights University's Administration Building.\n\nThe landmark Administration Building was a Romanesque six-story structure, designed by Denver architect [[Frank E. Edbrooke]] (1840-1921). The Administration Building was built from red sandstone and has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1975.<ref>[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Denver, Colorado]] - [[National Register of Historic Places listings in West Denver, Colorado]]</ref>\n\nOver the years, the school became a college and expanded to include teacher education programs, nursing programs, business, dance and more for both men and women.<ref>A more detailed history of the CHU campus from its beginning through the 1980s can be found at http://www.chu.edu/images/Section%201/1.2.1_WCHU_HistoryHeights.pdf</ref> The campus now has almost 20 structures, including a 1,000 seat theater, an interfaith chapel, a swimming pool, cafeteria, residence halls and recreational amenities.\n\nIn 1989, Teikyo Loretto Heights University (TLHU) opened on the campus of the former Loretto Heights College. TLHU focused on international students. In 2009, Colorado Heights University opened. Colorado Heights University was owned by the [[Teikyo University]] Group,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.teikyo-u.ac.jp/english/index.html|title=Teikyo University|website=www.teikyo-u.ac.jp|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref> a multinational educational foundation based in Japan that operates many undergraduate and graduate universities with more than 70,000 students spread across 46 campuses world-wide.\n\n==Academics==\nColorado Heights University focused on international business degree programs and English as a Second Language (ESL) courses. It offered Intensive English and [[Test of English as a Foreign Language]] (TOEFL) preparation certificate programs, the Bachelor of Arts in International Business, and various specializations in the Master of Business Administration in International Business.\n\n==Campus==\nIts campus had consisted of 20 buildings on a {{convert|74|acre|m2|adj=on}} site, the highest area in Denver. The Administration Building opened in 1891. Its prominent bell tower could be seen from miles around, serving as a landmark for many Denver residents.\n\n==Students==\nMost of the students at Colorado Heights University were non-traditional college students. This demographic includes international students, students who speak a language other than English as their native tongue.\n\nMost of the students at Colorado Heights University were bilingual and many are multilingual. It wasn't uncommon to find a student who speaks four or more languages. The primary languages spoken on campus were English, Spanish, Arabic and Russian.\n\nIn addition to the diversity of languages, those students also represented a diversity of cultures, religion and educational backgrounds.
