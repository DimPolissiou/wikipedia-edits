{"title_page": "Interactive voice response", "text_new": "{{Redirect|IVR}}\n\n'''Interactive voice response''' ('''IVR''') is a technology that allows a computer to interact with humans through the use of voice and [[dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|DTMF]] tones input via a keypad. In telecommunications, IVR allows customers to interact with a company\u2019s host system via a telephone keypad or by speech recognition, after which services can be inquired about through the IVR dialogue. IVR systems can respond with pre-recorded or dynamically generated audio to further direct users on how to proceed. IVR systems deployed in the network are sized to handle large call volumes and also used for outbound calling, as IVR systems are more intelligent than many [[predictive dialer]] systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/future-of-communications/2015/04/20/enhancing-customer-engagement-with-interactive-voice-response/#gref|title=Enhancing customer engagement with interactive voice response|publisher=The Next Web|author=Tolentino, Jamie}}</ref>\n\nIVR systems can be used for mobile purchases, banking payments, services, retail orders, utilities, travel information and weather conditions. A common misconception refers to an [[automated attendant]] as an IVR. The terms are distinct and mean different things to traditional telecommunications professionals\u2014the purpose of an IVR is to take input, process it, and return a result, whereas that of an automated attendant is to route calls. The term '''voice response unit''' ('''VRU''') is sometimes used as well.<ref>{{cite book | isbn=9780471216667 | title=Implementing Voice Over IP | first=Bhumip | last=Khasnabish | location=Lexington, Massachusetts, USA | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nmbexusn9q4C&pg=PA203&dq=vru+ivr&cd=9#v=onepage&q=vru%20ivr&f=false | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.| page=203 | accessdate=21 March 2012 | date=2003-05-30}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nDespite the increase in IVR technology during the 1970s, the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers.<ref>{{Cite news|title=History of a business revolution at the end of a phone|publisher=Scotland On Sunday|author=Harrington, Anthony}}</ref> The first commercial application of IVR was an order entry inventory control system designed and developed by Steven Schmidt in 1973. Early voice response systems were DSP technology based and limited to small vocabularies. In the early 1980s, Leon Ferber's Perception Technology became the first mainstream market competitor, after hard drive technology (read/write random-access to digitized voice data) had reached a cost-effective price point.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} At that time, a system could store digitized speech on disk, play the appropriate spoken message, and process the human's DTMF response.\n\nAs call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s, companies started to invest in [[computer telephony integration]] (CTI) with IVR systems. IVR became vital for call centers deploying universal queuing and routing solutions and acted as an agent which collected customer data to enable intelligent routing decisions. With improvements in technology, systems could use speaker-independent voice recognition of a limited vocabulary instead of requiring the person to use DTMF signaling.\n\nStarting in the 2000s, voice response became more common and cheaper to deploy. This was due to increased [[Central processing unit|CPU]] power and the migration of speech applications from proprietary code to the [[VoiceXML|VXML]] standard.\n\n== Technology ==\n[[DTMF]] decoding and [[VOICE recognition]] are used to interpret the caller's response to voice prompts. DTMF tones are entered via the [[telephone keypad]].\n\nOther technologies include using [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] (TTS) to speak complex and dynamic information, such as e-mails, news reports or weather information. IVR technology is also being introduced into automobile systems for hands-free operation. TTS is computer generated synthesized speech that is no longer the robotic voice traditionally associated with computers. Real voices create the speech in fragments that are spliced together (concatenated) and smoothed before being played to the caller.\n\nAn IVR can be deployed in several ways:\n\n# Equipment installed on the customer premises\n# Equipment installed in the PSTN (public switched telephone network)\n# [[Application service provider]] (ASP) / hosted IVR\n\nAn [[automatic call distributor]] (ACD) is often the first point of contact when calling many larger businesses. An ACD uses digital storage devices to play greetings or announcements, but typically routes a caller without prompting for input. An IVR can play announcements and request an input from the caller. This information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set. (A skill set is a function applied to a group of call-center agents with a particular skill.)\n\nInteractive voice response can be used to front-end a [[call center]] operation by identifying the needs of the caller. Information can be obtained from the caller such as an account number. Answers to simple questions such as account balances or pre-recorded information can be provided without operator intervention. Account numbers from the IVR are often compared to [[caller ID]] data for security reasons and additional IVR responses are required if the caller ID does not match the account record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/interactive-voice-response.htm|title=How Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Works|publisher=How Stuff Works|author=Dave Roos}}</ref>\n\nIVR call flows are created in a variety of ways. A traditional IVR depended upon proprietary programming or scripting languages, whereas modern IVR applications are generated in a similar way to [[World Wide Web|Web]] pages, using standards such as [[VoiceXML]],<ref name=\"VXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml21 | title = Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) Version 2.1 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> [[CCXML]],<ref name=\"CCXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/ccxml | title = Voice Browser Call Control: CCXML Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C }}</ref> [[SRGS]]<ref name=\"SRGS\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar | title = Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> and [[Speech Synthesis Markup Language|SSML]].<ref name=\"SSML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis | title = Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> The ability to use XML-driven applications allows a [[web server]] to act as the [[application server]], freeing the IVR developer to focus on the call flow.\n\nIVR speech recognition interactions (call flows) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input: directed, open-ended, and mixed dialogue.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\">{{cite book\n | last = Suendermann\n | first = David\n | title = Advances in Commercial Deployment of Spoken Dialog Systems\n | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]]\n | location = Berlin\n | date = 2011\n | pages = 9\u201311\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\">{{cite book\n | last = Perez-Marin\n | first = Diana\n | title = Conversational Agents and Natural Language Interaction: Techniques and Effective Practices\n | publisher = IGI Global\n | location = Hershey, Pennsylvania\n | date = 2011\n | page = 340\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\">{{cite web\n | title = Presentation of Information - Aurally\n | publisher = W3C\n | url = https://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml/#s6.5\n | access-date = 26 October 2016\n }}</ref>\n\nA directed dialogue prompt communicates a set of valid responses to the user (e.g. \"How can I help you? ... Say something like, ''account balance, order status,'' or ''more options''\"). An open-ended prompt does not communicate a set of valid responses (e.g. \"How can I help you?\"). In both cases, the goal is to glean a valid spoken response from the user. The key difference is that with directed dialogue, the user is more likely to speak an option exactly as was communicated by the prompt (e.g. \"account balance\"). With an open-ended prompt, however, the user is likely to include extraneous words or phrases (e.g. \"I was just looking at my bill and saw that my balance was wrong.\"). The open-ended prompt requires a greater degree of [[natural language processing]] to extract the relevant information from the phrase (i.e. \"balance\"). Open-ended recognition also requires a larger [[grammar]] set, which accounts for a wider array of permutations of a given response (e.g. \"balance was wrong\", \"wrong balance\", \"balance is high\", \"high balance\"). Despite the greater amount of data and processing required for open-ended prompts, they are more interactively efficient, as the prompts themselves are typically much shorter.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\"/>\n\nA mixed dialogue approach involves shifting from open-ended to directed dialogue or vice versa within the same interaction, as one type of prompt may be more effective in a given situation. Mixed dialog prompts must also be able to recognize responses that are not relevant to the immediate prompt, for instance in the case of a user deciding to shift to a function different from the current one.<ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\"/><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\"/>\n\nHigher level IVR development tools are available to further simplify the application development process. A call flow diagram can be drawn with a GUI tool and the presentation layer (typically VoiceXML) can be automatically generated. In addition, these tools normally provide extension mechanisms for software integration, such as an HTTP interface to a website and a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] interface for connecting to a database.\n\nIn [[telecommunications]], an '''audio response unit''' (ARU) is a device that provides synthesized voice responses to DTMF keypresses by processing calls based on (a) the call-originator input, (b) information received from a database, and (c) information in the incoming call, such as the time of day. ARUs increase the number of information calls handled and provide consistent quality in information retrieval.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Usage ==\nIVR systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost. The use of IVR allows callers' queries to be resolved without a live agent. If callers do not find the information they need, the calls may be transferred to a live agent. The approach allows live agents to have more time to deal with complex interactions. When an IVR system answers multiple phone numbers, the use of [[DNIS]] ensures that the correct application and language is executed. A single large IVR system can handle calls for thousands of applications, each with its own phone numbers and script.\n\nCall centers use IVR systems to identify and segment callers. The ability to identify customers allows services to be tailored according to the customer profile. The caller can be given the option to wait in the queue, choose an automated service, or request a callback. The system may obtain [[caller line identification]] (CLI) data from the network to help identify or authenticate the caller. Additional caller authentication data could include account number, personal information, password and biometrics (such as voice print). IVR also enables customer prioritization. In a system wherein individual customers may have a different status, the service will automatically prioritize the individual's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue.\n\nIVRs will also log call detail information into its own database for auditing, performance report, and future IVR system enhancements. [[Computer telephony integration|CTI]] allows a contact center or organization to gather information about the caller as a means of directing the inquiry to the appropriate agent. CTI can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the IVR dialog from the IVR to the agent desktop using a [[Screen pop|screen-pop]], making for a more effective and efficient service. Voice-activated dialing (VAD) IVR systems are used to automate routine inquiries to a switchboard or [[PABX]] (Private Automatic Branch exchange) operators, and are used in many hospitals and large businesses to reduce the caller waiting time. An additional function is the ability to allow external callers to page staff and transfer the inbound call to the paged person. IVR can be used to provide a more sophisticated [[voice mail]] experience to the caller.\n\n===Banking===\nBanking institutions are reliant on IVR systems for [[customer engagement]] and to extend business hours to a [[24/7]] operation. [[Telephone banking]] allows customers to check balances and transaction histories as well as to make payments and transfers. As online channels have emerged, banking customer satisfaction has decreased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itproportal.com/2016/05/10/interactive-voice-response-ivr-the-missing-link/|title=Interactive Voice Response (IVR): The missing link|publisher=IT Pro Portal|author=Comes, Sherry}}</ref>\n\n=== Medical ===\nIVR systems are used by pharmaceutical companies and [[contract research organization]]s to conduct [[clinical trial]]s and manage the large volumes of data generated. The caller will respond to questions in their preferred language and their responses will be logged into a database and possibly recorded at the same time to confirm authenticity. Applications include patient randomization and drug supply management. They are also used in recording patient diaries and questionnaires.<ref name=\"Lam2009\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lam MY, Lee H, Bright R, Korzenik JR, Sands BE |title=Validation of interactive voice response system administration of the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire |journal=Inflamm.

Hospitals and clinics have used IVR systems to allow callers to receive anonymous access to test results. This is information that could easily be handled by a person but the IVR system is used to preserve privacy and avoid potential embarrassment of sensitive information or test results. Users are given a passcode to access their results.\n\n=== Surveying ===\nSome of the largest installed IVR platforms are used for televoting on television game shows, such as ''[[Pop Idol]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', which can generate enormous call spikes. The network provider will often deploy ''[[call gapping]]'' in the [[PSTN]] to prevent network overload. IVR may also be used by survey organizations to ask more sensitive questions where the investigators are concerned that a respondent might feel less comfortable providing these answers to a human interlocutor (such as questions about drug use or sexual behavior). In some cases, an IVR system can be used in the same survey in conjunction with a human interviewer.\n\n==Social Impact ==\nBy allowing\u00a0low-literacy populations to interact with technology, IVR systems form an avenue to build technological skills in developing countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/unesco-pearson_draft_guidelines_for_digital_inclusion.pdf|title=Unesco Guidelines for Digital Inclusion|publisher=Unesco}}</ref> Developing countries have a prevalence of mobile phones even in rural areas which make provide room for IVR technology to support social good projects. However, most IVR technology is designed in resource-rich domains hence research is necessary to contextualize and adapt this technology for developing countries.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|title=Information and communication technologies for development|date=2019-03-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Information_and_communication_technologies_for_development&oldid=885920797|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> Research in ICTD has helped tailor IVR towards social impact has created innovative applications in health, agricultural, entertainment and citizen journalism.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nIn rural India, it is critical for farmers to obtain information early. Although television and radio have made it easy to spread information in remote areas, farmers need community support to transform these messages into actionable advice. One of the early research projects in ICTD\u00a0 and IVR was Avaaj Otalo.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Neil|last2=Chittamuru|first2=Deepti|last3=Jain|first3=Anupam|last4=Dave|first4=Paresh|last5=Parikh|first5=Tapan S.|date=2010|title=Avaaj Otalo: A Field Study of an Interactive Voice Forum for Small Farmers in Rural India|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '10|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=733\u2013742|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753434|isbn=9781605589299}}</ref> This project was stemmed out of a \u00a0research project in 2009. In Avaaj Otalo, farmers could avail information by dialing a phone number and navigating through simple audio prompts, they also had the liberty to record questions their peers or local NGO staff. This research project has hence spun off as a company called Awaaz.de<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://awaaz.de/|title=Awaaz.De {{!}} Mobile Solutions for Social Impact|website=awaaz.de|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> a social enterprise that works with developmental organizations by providing tools for them to work with marginalized users.\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nIn the context of tuberculosis, patients need to adhere to the medicine daily basis for a period of few months to completely heal. In public sector, there is a scheme called [[Directly observed treatment, short-course|DOTS]] (Directly Observed Therapy Short Course<ref>{{Citation|title=Directly observed treatment, short-course|date=2018-11-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Directly_observed_treatment,_short-course&oldid=867126871|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>) which was the most effective source for poor population. However, this method requires the patient to commute to the clinic everyday which adds financial and time constraints to the patient.\n\n99DOTS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.99dots.org/|title=99DOTS|website=www.99dots.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> is a project that uses good ICTD principles<ref name=\":0\" /> to use IVR technology to benefit TB patients. Patients have a customized packet of tablets that they receive from the healthcare official who trains them to take the medicine in the sequence daily. Opening the packet in a sequence reveals a phone number that the patient needs to dial to acknowledge that they have taken the medicine. This research project was based out of Microsoft Research India by Bill Theis and who received MacArthur Fellowship for the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/973/|title=Bill Thies - MacArthur Foundation|website=www.macfound.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> The project has spun off as Everwell Technologies<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everwell.org/|title=Everwell|website=www.everwell.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> which now works closely with the Government of India to scale this technology to patients throughout India.\n\n=== Community-based entertainment ===\nAlthough Radio is a very popular means of entertainment, IVR provides interactivity which can help engage in novel ways using their phones.

As calls are queued in the SIP contact center, the IVR system can provide treatment or automation, wait for a fixed period, or play music. Inbound calls to a SIP contact center must be queued or terminated against a SIP end point; SIP IVR systems can be used to replace agents directly by the use of applications deployed using BBUA (back-to-back user agents).\n\n=== Interactive messaging response (IMR) ===\nDue to the introduction of [[instant messaging]] (IM) in contact centers, agents can handle up to 6 different IM conversations at the same time, which increases agent productivity.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} IVR technology is being used to automate IM conversations using existing [[natural language processing]] software. This differs from email handling as email automated response is based on key word spotting and IM conversations are conversational. The use of text messaging abbreviations and smilies requires different grammars to those currently used for speech recognition. IM is also starting to replace text messaging on multimedia mobile handsets.\n\n=== Hosted vs. on-premises IVR ===\nWith the introduction of [[web services]] into the contact center, host integration has been simplified, allowing IVR applications to be hosted remotely from the contact center. This has meant hosted IVR applications using speech are now available to smaller contact centers across the globe and has led to an expansion of ASP (application service providers).\n\nIVR applications can also be hosted on the public network, without contact center integration. Services include public announcement messages and message services for small business. It is also possible to deploy two-prong IVR services where the initial IVR application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center. This can be used to balance loading across multiple contact centers or provide business continuity in the event of a system outage.\n\n==Criticism==\nIVR has historically received criticism for its difficulty of use and a lack of appreciation of the caller's needs as well as objections to providing a voice response to an automated system. However, modern IVR systems are able to include caller context and provide personalized options. Companies have also been criticized for using IVR to reduce operational costs as the solution replaces the need for human agents to address voice inquiries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/chat-bots-are-cool-but-will-they-replace-humans/|title=Chat Bots Are Cool, But Will They Replace Humans?|publisher=CMS Wire}}</ref>  Additionally, as basic information is now available online, the calls coming into a call center are more likely to be complex problems and not ones that can be resolved in an automated fashion, thus requiring the attention of a live agent.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Automated attendant]]\n*[[Automatic call distributor]]\n*[[Automatic number identification]]\n*[[Call avoidance]]\n*[[Call Whisper|Call whisper]]\n*[[Dialog system]]\n*[[DNIS]]\n*[[Dual-tone multi-frequency]] (DTMF)\n*[[Electronic patient-reported outcome]]\n*[[Natural language]]\n*[[Speech recognition]]\n*[[Speech synthesis]]\n*[[Voice portal]]\n*[[The Voder]]\n*[[Voice-based marketing automation]]\n*[[Voice User Interface]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[https://www.enjayworld.com/blog/cti-computer-telephony-integration/ CTI \u2013 Computer Telephony Integration]\n\n==External links==\n<!-- ATTENTION!

In telecommunications, IVR allows customers to interact with a company\u2019s host system via a telephone keypad or by speech recognition, after which services can be inquired about through the IVR dialogue. IVR systems can respond with pre-recorded or dynamically generated audio to further direct users on how to proceed. IVR systems deployed in the network are sized to handle large call volumes and also used for outbound calling, as IVR systems are more intelligent than many [[predictive dialer]] systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/future-of-communications/2015/04/20/enhancing-customer-engagement-with-interactive-voice-response/#gref|title=Enhancing customer engagement with interactive voice response|publisher=The Next Web|author=Tolentino, Jamie}}</ref>\n\nIVR systems can be used for mobile purchases, banking payments, services, retail orders, utilities, travel information and weather conditions. A common misconception refers to an [[automated attendant]] as an IVR. The terms are distinct and mean different things to traditional telecommunications professionals\u2014the purpose of an IVR is to take input, process it, and return a result, whereas that of an automated attendant is to route calls. The term '''voice response unit''' ('''VRU''') is sometimes used as well.<ref>{{cite book | isbn=9780471216667 | title=Implementing Voice Over IP | first=Bhumip | last=Khasnabish | location=Lexington, Massachusetts, USA | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nmbexusn9q4C&pg=PA203&dq=vru+ivr&cd=9#v=onepage&q=vru%20ivr&f=false | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.| page=203 | accessdate=21 March 2012 | date=2003-05-30}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nDespite the increase in IVR technology during the 1970s, the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers.<ref>{{Cite news|title=History of a business revolution at the end of a phone|publisher=Scotland On Sunday|author=Harrington, Anthony}}</ref> The first commercial application of IVR was an order entry inventory control system designed and developed by Steven Schmidt in 1973. Early voice response systems were DSP technology based and limited to small vocabularies. In the early 1980s, Leon Ferber's Perception Technology became the first mainstream market competitor, after hard drive technology (read/write random-access to digitized voice data) had reached a cost-effective price point.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} At that time, a system could store digitized speech on disk, play the appropriate spoken message, and process the human's DTMF response.\n\nAs call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s, companies started to invest in [[computer telephony integration]] (CTI) with IVR systems. IVR became vital for call centers deploying universal queuing and routing solutions and acted as an agent which collected customer data to enable intelligent routing decisions. With improvements in technology, systems could use speaker-independent voice recognition of a limited vocabulary instead of requiring the person to use DTMF signaling.\n\nStarting in the 2000s, voice response became more common and cheaper to deploy. This was due to increased [[Central processing unit|CPU]] power and the migration of speech applications from proprietary code to the [[VoiceXML|VXML]] standard.\n\n== Technology ==\n[[DTMF]] decoding and [[VOICE recognition]] are used to interpret the caller's response to voice prompts. DTMF tones are entered via the [[telephone keypad]].\n\nOther technologies include using [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] (TTS) to speak complex and dynamic information, such as e-mails, news reports or weather information. IVR technology is also being introduced into automobile systems for hands-free operation. TTS is computer generated synthesized speech that is no longer the robotic voice traditionally associated with computers. Real voices create the speech in fragments that are spliced together (concatenated) and smoothed before being played to the caller.\n\nAn IVR can be deployed in several ways:\n\n# Equipment installed on the customer premises\n# Equipment installed in the PSTN (public switched telephone network)\n# [[Application service provider]] (ASP) / hosted IVR\n\nAn [[automatic call distributor]] (ACD) is often the first point of contact when calling many larger businesses. An ACD uses digital storage devices to play greetings or announcements, but typically routes a caller without prompting for input. An IVR can play announcements and request an input from the caller. This information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set. (A skill set is a function applied to a group of call-center agents with a particular skill.)\n\nInteractive voice response can be used to front-end a [[call center]] operation by identifying the needs of the caller. Information can be obtained from the caller such as an account number. Answers to simple questions such as account balances or pre-recorded information can be provided without operator intervention. Account numbers from the IVR are often compared to [[caller ID]] data for security reasons and additional IVR responses are required if the caller ID does not match the account record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/interactive-voice-response.htm|title=How Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Works|publisher=How Stuff Works|author=Dave Roos}}</ref>\n\nIVR call flows are created in a variety of ways. A traditional IVR depended upon proprietary programming or scripting languages, whereas modern IVR applications are generated in a similar way to [[World Wide Web|Web]] pages, using standards such as [[VoiceXML]],<ref name=\"VXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml21 | title = Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) Version 2.1 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> [[CCXML]],<ref name=\"CCXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/ccxml | title = Voice Browser Call Control: CCXML Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C }}</ref> [[SRGS]]<ref name=\"SRGS\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar | title = Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> and [[Speech Synthesis Markup Language|SSML]].<ref name=\"SSML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis | title = Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> The ability to use XML-driven applications allows a [[web server]] to act as the [[application server]], freeing the IVR developer to focus on the call flow.\n\nIVR speech recognition interactions (call flows) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input: directed, open-ended, and mixed dialogue.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\">{{cite book\n | last = Suendermann\n | first = David\n | title = Advances in Commercial Deployment of Spoken Dialog Systems\n | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]]\n | location = Berlin\n | date = 2011\n | pages = 9\u201311\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\">{{cite book\n | last = Perez-Marin\n | first = Diana\n | title = Conversational Agents and Natural Language Interaction: Techniques and Effective Practices\n | publisher = IGI Global\n | location = Hershey, Pennsylvania\n | date = 2011\n | page = 340\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\">{{cite web\n | title = Presentation of Information - Aurally\n | publisher = W3C\n | url = https://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml/#s6.5\n | access-date = 26 October 2016\n }}</ref>\n\nA directed dialogue prompt communicates a set of valid responses to the user (e.g. \"How can I help you? ... Say something like, ''account balance, order status,'' or ''more options''\"). An open-ended prompt does not communicate a set of valid responses (e.g. \"How can I help you?\"). In both cases, the goal is to glean a valid spoken response from the user. The key difference is that with directed dialogue, the user is more likely to speak an option exactly as was communicated by the prompt (e.g. \"account balance\"). With an open-ended prompt, however, the user is likely to include extraneous words or phrases (e.g. \"I was just looking at my bill and saw that my balance was wrong.\"). The open-ended prompt requires a greater degree of [[natural language processing]] to extract the relevant information from the phrase (i.e. \"balance\"). Open-ended recognition also requires a larger [[grammar]] set, which accounts for a wider array of permutations of a given response (e.g. \"balance was wrong\", \"wrong balance\", \"balance is high\", \"high balance\"). Despite the greater amount of data and processing required for open-ended prompts, they are more interactively efficient, as the prompts themselves are typically much shorter.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\"/>\n\nA mixed dialogue approach involves shifting from open-ended to directed dialogue or vice versa within the same interaction, as one type of prompt may be more effective in a given situation. Mixed dialog prompts must also be able to recognize responses that are not relevant to the immediate prompt, for instance in the case of a user deciding to shift to a function different from the current one.<ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\"/><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\"/>\n\nHigher level IVR development tools are available to further simplify the application development process. A call flow diagram can be drawn with a GUI tool and the presentation layer (typically VoiceXML) can be automatically generated. In addition, these tools normally provide extension mechanisms for software integration, such as an HTTP interface to a website and a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] interface for connecting to a database.\n\nIn [[telecommunications]], an '''audio response unit''' (ARU) is a device that provides synthesized voice responses to DTMF keypresses by processing calls based on (a) the call-originator input, (b) information received from a database, and (c) information in the incoming call, such as the time of day. ARUs increase the number of information calls handled and provide consistent quality in information retrieval.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Usage ==\nIVR systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost. The use of IVR allows callers' queries to be resolved without a live agent. If callers do not find the information they need, the calls may be transferred to a live agent. The approach allows live agents to have more time to deal with complex interactions. When an IVR system answers multiple phone numbers, the use of [[DNIS]] ensures that the correct application and language is executed. A single large IVR system can handle calls for thousands of applications, each with its own phone numbers and script.\n\nCall centers use IVR systems to identify and segment callers. The ability to identify customers allows services to be tailored according to the customer profile. The caller can be given the option to wait in the queue, choose an automated service, or request a callback. The system may obtain [[caller line identification]] (CLI) data from the network to help identify or authenticate the caller. Additional caller authentication data could include account number, personal information, password and biometrics (such as voice print). IVR also enables customer prioritization. In a system wherein individual customers may have a different status, the service will automatically prioritize the individual's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue.\n\nIVRs will also log call detail information into its own database for auditing, performance report, and future IVR system enhancements. [[Computer telephony integration|CTI]] allows a contact center or organization to gather information about the caller as a means of directing the inquiry to the appropriate agent. CTI can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the IVR dialog from the IVR to the agent desktop using a [[Screen pop|screen-pop]], making for a more effective and efficient service. Voice-activated dialing (VAD) IVR systems are used to automate routine inquiries to a switchboard or [[PABX]] (Private Automatic Branch exchange) operators, and are used in many hospitals and large businesses to reduce the caller waiting time. An additional function is the ability to allow external callers to page staff and transfer the inbound call to the paged person. IVR can be used to provide a more sophisticated [[voice mail]] experience to the caller.\n\n===Banking===\nBanking institutions are reliant on IVR systems for [[customer engagement]] and to extend business hours to a [[24/7]] operation. [[Telephone banking]] allows customers to check balances and transaction histories as well as to make payments and transfers. As online channels have emerged, banking customer satisfaction has decreased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itproportal.com/2016/05/10/interactive-voice-response-ivr-the-missing-link/|title=Interactive Voice Response (IVR): The missing link|publisher=IT Pro Portal|author=Comes, Sherry}}</ref>\n\n=== Medical ===\nIVR systems are used by pharmaceutical companies and [[contract research organization]]s to conduct [[clinical trial]]s and manage the large volumes of data generated. The caller will respond to questions in their preferred language and their responses will be logged into a database and possibly recorded at the same time to confirm authenticity. Applications include patient randomization and drug supply management. They are also used in recording patient diaries and questionnaires.<ref name=\"Lam2009\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lam MY, Lee H, Bright R, Korzenik JR, Sands BE |title=Validation of interactive voice response system administration of the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire |journal=Inflamm.

Hospitals and clinics have used IVR systems to allow callers to receive anonymous access to test results. This is information that could easily be handled by a person but the IVR system is used to preserve privacy and avoid potential embarrassment of sensitive information or test results. Users are given a passcode to access their results.\n\n=== Surveying ===\nSome of the largest installed IVR platforms are used for televoting on television game shows, such as ''[[Pop Idol]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', which can generate enormous call spikes. The network provider will often deploy ''[[call gapping]]'' in the [[PSTN]] to prevent network overload. IVR may also be used by survey organizations to ask more sensitive questions where the investigators are concerned that a respondent might feel less comfortable providing these answers to a human interlocutor (such as questions about drug use or sexual behavior). In some cases, an IVR system can be used in the same survey in conjunction with a human interviewer.\n\n==Social Impact ==\nBy allowing\u00a0low-literacy populations to interact with technology, IVR systems form an avenue to build technological skills in developing countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/unesco-pearson_draft_guidelines_for_digital_inclusion.pdf|title=Unesco Guidelines for Digital Inclusion|publisher=Unesco}}</ref> Developing countries have a prevalence of mobile phones even in rural areas which make provide room for IVR technology to support social good projects.

Although television and radio have made it easy to spread information in remote areas, farmers need community support to transform these messages into actionable advice. One of the early research projects in ICTD\u00a0 and IVR was Avaaj Otalo.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Neil|last2=Chittamuru|first2=Deepti|last3=Jain|first3=Anupam|last4=Dave|first4=Paresh|last5=Parikh|first5=Tapan S.|date=2010|title=Avaaj Otalo: A Field Study of an Interactive Voice Forum for Small Farmers in Rural India|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '10|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=733\u2013742|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753434|isbn=9781605589299}}</ref> This project was stemmed out of a \u00a0research project in 2009. In Avaaj Otalo, farmers could avail information by dialing a phone number and navigating through simple audio prompts, they also had the liberty to record questions their peers or local NGO staff. This research project has hence spun off as a company called Awaaz.de<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://awaaz.de/|title=Awaaz.De {{!}} Mobile Solutions for Social Impact|website=awaaz.de|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> a social enterprise that works with developmental organizations by providing tools for them to work with marginalized users.\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nIn the context of tuberculosis, patients need to adhere to the medicine daily basis for a period of few months to completely heal. In public sector, there is a scheme called [[Directly observed treatment, short-course|DOTS]] (Directly Observed Therapy Short Course<ref>{{Citation|title=Directly observed treatment, short-course|date=2018-11-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Directly_observed_treatment,_short-course&oldid=867126871|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>) which was the most effective source for poor population. However, this method requires the patient to commute to the clinic everyday which adds financial and time constraints to the patient.\n\n99DOTS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.99dots.org/|title=99DOTS|website=www.99dots.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> is a project that uses good ICTD principles<ref name=\":0\" /> to use IVR technology to benefit TB patients. Patients have a customized packet of tablets that they receive from the healthcare official who trains them to take the medicine in the sequence daily. Opening the packet in a sequence reveals a phone number that the patient needs to dial to acknowledge that they have taken the medicine. This research project was based out of Microsoft Research India by Bill Theis and who received MacArthur Fellowship for the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/973/|title=Bill Thies - MacArthur Foundation|website=www.macfound.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> The project has spun off as Everwell Technologies<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everwell.org/|title=Everwell|website=www.everwell.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> which now works closely with the Government of India to scale this technology to patients throughout India.\n\n=== Community-based entertainment ===\nAlthough Radio is a very popular means of entertainment, IVR provides interactivity which can help engage in novel ways using their phones. ICTD research has used IVR entertainment as a mechanism to support communities and provide information to populations that are hard to reach by traditional methods.\n\n* Sangeet Swara:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vashistha|first=Aditya|last2=Cutrell|first2=Edward|last3=Borriello|first3=Gaetano|last4=Thies|first4=William|date=2015|title=Sangeet Swara: A Community-Moderated Voice Forum in Rural India|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=417\u2013426|doi=10.1145/2702123.2702191|isbn=9781450331456}}</ref> voice-based singing platform for low literate users in India.

The system was moderated by editors who listened to these messages and later transcribed these messages onto a blog.\n\n== Developments ==\n=== Video ===\nThe introduction of [[Session initiation protocol|Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) means that point-to-point communications are no longer restricted to voice calls but can now be extended to multimedia technologies such as [[video]]. IVR manufacturers have extended their systems into IVVR (interactive voice and video response), especially for the mobile phone networks. The use of video gives IVR systems the ability to implement [[multimodal interaction]] with the caller.\n\nThe introduction of [[full-duplex]] video IVR in the future will allow systems the ability to read emotions and facial expressions. It may also be used to identify the caller, using technology such as [[Iris scan]] or other [[biometric]] means. Recordings of the caller may be stored to monitor certain transactions and can be used to reduce identity fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nojitter.com/post/240171759/goodbye-ivr-hello-ivisuali-ivr|title=Goodbye IVR... Hello Visual IVR|publisher=No Jitter}}</ref>\n\n=== SIP contact center ===\nWith the introduction of SIP contact centers, call control in a SIP contact center can be implemented by [[CCXML]] scripting, which is an adjunct to the [[VXML]] language used to generate modern IVR dialogues. As calls are queued in the SIP contact center, the IVR system can provide treatment or automation, wait for a fixed period, or play music. Inbound calls to a SIP contact center must be queued or terminated against a SIP end point; SIP IVR systems can be used to replace agents directly by the use of applications deployed using BBUA (back-to-back user agents).\n\n=== Interactive messaging response (IMR) ===\nDue to the introduction of [[instant messaging]] (IM) in contact centers, agents can handle up to 6 different IM conversations at the same time, which increases agent productivity.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} IVR technology is being used to automate IM conversations using existing [[natural language processing]] software. This differs from email handling as email automated response is based on key word spotting and IM conversations are conversational. The use of text messaging abbreviations and smilies requires different grammars to those currently used for speech recognition. IM is also starting to replace text messaging on multimedia mobile handsets.\n\n=== Hosted vs. on-premises IVR ===\nWith the introduction of [[web services]] into the contact center, host integration has been simplified, allowing IVR applications to be hosted remotely from the contact center. This has meant hosted IVR applications using speech are now available to smaller contact centers across the globe and has led to an expansion of ASP (application service providers).\n\nIVR applications can also be hosted on the public network, without contact center integration. Services include public announcement messages and message services for small business. It is also possible to deploy two-prong IVR services where the initial IVR application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center. This can be used to balance loading across multiple contact centers or provide business continuity in the event of a system outage.\n\n==Criticism==\nIVR has historically received criticism for its difficulty of use and a lack of appreciation of the caller's needs as well as objections to providing a voice response to an automated system. However, modern IVR systems are able to include caller context and provide personalized options. Companies have also been criticized for using IVR to reduce operational costs as the solution replaces the need for human agents to address voice inquiries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/chat-bots-are-cool-but-will-they-replace-humans/|title=Chat Bots Are Cool, But Will They Replace Humans?|publisher=CMS Wire}}</ref>  Additionally, as basic information is now available online, the calls coming into a call center are more likely to be complex problems and not ones that can be resolved in an automated fashion, thus requiring the attention of a live agent.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Automated attendant]]\n*[[Automatic call distributor]]\n*[[Automatic number identification]]\n*[[Call avoidance]]\n*[[Call Whisper|Call whisper]]\n*[[Dialog system]]\n*[[DNIS]]\n*[[Dual-tone multi-frequency]] (DTMF)\n*[[Electronic patient-reported outcome]]\n*[[Natural language]]\n*[[Speech recognition]]\n*[[Speech synthesis]]\n*[[Voice portal]]\n*[[The Voder]]\n*[[Voice-based marketing automation]]\n*[[Voice User Interface]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- ATTENTION!

He was bestowed with the fourth highest civilian honour of India, the [[Padma Shri]] award for his dedication in the field of Films and Arts.\n\nAfter making his acting debut in Bollywood with the 1978 drama ''[[Gaman]]'', Patekar acted in a few [[Marathi language|Marathi]] films and some Bollywood films. After these roles, he achieved his breakthrough by starring as a gangster in ''[[Parinda]]'' (1989), for which he won the [[National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor|National Film Award]] and the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor|Filmfare Award]] for Best Supporting Actor. Later, he acted in and made his directorial debut with ''[[Prahaar: The Final Attack]]'' (1994). Patekar subsequently starred in and received critical acclaim for his performance in several commercially successful films of the 1990s, including ''[[Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman]]'' (1992); ''[[Angaar]]'' (1992), for which he won the [[Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role|Filmfare Award for Best Villain]]; ''[[Tirangaa]]'' (1993); ''[[Krantiveer]]'' (1994), for which he won the [[National Film Award for Best Actor|National Film Award]] and the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor|Filmfare Award]] for Best Actor; ''[[Agni Sakshi (1996 film)|Agni Sakshi]]'' (1996), for which he won his second National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor; and ''[[Khamoshi: The Musical]]'' (1996).

Game which Toro lost 4-3.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toro.it/press/view/3228|title=3 May 1949: Benfica-Torino 4-3|publisher=toro.it}}</ref> Torino was named winner of the championship  by  the Federation, and the Youth squad was able to play the last 4 rounds.\nFinished a short summer interval from the end of previous season, competition officially resumed in Italy after the [[1948 Summer Olympics]]. Prematurely eliminated, [[Vittorio Pozzo]] lost his position as sole commissioner of the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] and [[Ferruccio Novo]] took his place.\n\nNew season began in mid-September with a Torino almost identical to that of the previous championships; there was only [[Franco Ossola]] permanently in place of [[Pietro Ferraris]], who, at age 36, had moved to [[Novara Calcio|Novara]]. The [[central midfielder|midfielder]] [[Rubens Fadini]] arrived from Gallarate, [[Dino Ballarin]], brother of the goalkeeper [[Aldo Ballarin|Aldo]] was signed from Chioggia; the Hungarian-Czechoslovakian [[J\u00falius Schubert]], a left-sided midfielder; and strikers [[Emile Bongiorni]] and [[Ruggero Grava]] arrived from [[Racing Club de France|Racing Parigi]] and [[CO Roubaix-Tourcoing|Roubaix-Tourcoing]] respectively.\nThe club began the season after a long tour in [[Brazil]] where the team met [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]], [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo FC|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa de Desportos|Portuguesa]], losing only once. During the season, reduced to 24 teams after three promotions and relegations, [[Ernest Erbstein]] was appointed as the team's technical director and the Englishman [[Leslie Lievesley]] became the coach.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chesterfield-fc.co.uk/page/PastPlayersDetail/0,,10435~979069,00.html | title = Past players |publisher=Chesterfield F.C. | accessdate = 2011-06-21}}</ref>\nThe campaign also saw injuries to [[Virgilio Maroso]], [[Eusebio Castigliano]], [[Romeo Menti]] and [[Sauro Tom\u00e0]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torinofc.it/storia|title=La Storia del Torino Fc|publisher=Torino Football Club|language=Italian|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref>, plus the long suspension for [[Aldo Ballarin]]. The Granata, which debuted with a victory against [[Aurora Pro Patria 1919|Pro Patria]], suffered a defeat in the second round to [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]]; the team recovered with five straight wins, including that of the [[Turin derby|derby]], but lost again, in [[Milan]], against the ''Rossoneri''.\nThe club would relinquish the lead in the standings<ref>{{Cite book|author=Ormezzano|title=Toro 49|p= 164}}.</ref>, then recapture it, finishing midway through the season on par with [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], from which a third defeat was suffered, losing 3\u20130. In the return leg of the derby Torino would defeat [[Juventus]] 3\u20130. \nTorino's advantage increased in the standings, gaining a maximum of six point on [[Inter Milan|Inter]] in second place<ref>{{cite book|author=Colombero,|title=Pacifico|p=120}}</ref>. However, a pair of draws (in [[Trieste]] and [[Bari]]) allowed Inter to close the gap within four points from Torino. On 30 April 1949, the two clubs met in Milan, ending 0\u20130, with Torino approaching their fifth consecutive title (the record would be equaled).\nThe team travelled to Portugal to play in a friendly against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. However, upon return Torino perished in the [[Superga air disaster]].\n\n=== Superga air disaster ===\n{{main|Superga air disaster}}\nThe airplane with the team crashed at [[Basilica di Superga]] nearby Torino. There were deaths of team chairmans and club workers, baggage men and three of the best journalists  in the country at the time: [[Renato Casalbore]] (founder of Tuttosport magazine); [[Renato Tosatti]] (from journal Gazzetta del Popolo) and [[Luigi Cavallero]] (from journal La Stampa). \nThe shocking corpse identification was made by former Italian National Team manager [[Vittorio Pozzo]]. The spezzino player [[Sauro Tom\u00e0]], injured, did not travel to Lisboa. The following persons in the Torino circle did not travel: second goalkeeper [[Renato Gandolfi]] (instead third  goalkeeper [[Dino Ballarin]] did), the radio anchor [[Nicol\u00f2 Carosio]] and former manager of Italian National Team also journalist Vittorio Pozzo (Torino prefered to give the seat to Cavallero).\n<ref>{{cite web |author=Patrick Jennings |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46788983 |title=The plane crash that killed Serie A's champions and their English coach |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 January 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpWbGJPo1-c&source=video&vgc=rss&usg=AFQjCNFfzesVbEpVRJXx4KxoHr8LKgclPQ |title=TG-R \"Leonardo\": possibili cause della sciagura di Superga: l'ipotesi dell'altimetro guasto|publisher= Andrea Sinaglia YouTube }}</ref>\n\n====Legacy====\nThe impact of the tragedy in Italy was colossal.

Today, the NPS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nps.karvy.com/|title=National Pension Scheme (NPS) in India|website=Karvy KCRA eNPS}}</ref> is readily available and tax efficient under Section 80CCC and Section 80CCD.

Based on the recommendations of the OASIS report, the Government of India introduced a new Defined Contribution Pension System for the new entrants to Central/State Government service, except to the Defence forces i.e. Army, Navy and Air Force, replacing the existing system of the Defined Benefit Pension System.\n\nOn 23 August 2003, the Interim Pension Fund Regulatory & Development Authority (PFRDA) was established through a resolution by the Government of India to \"promote old age income security by establishing, developing and regulating pension funds, to protect the interests of subscribers to schemes of pension funds and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\" The Pension Fund Regulatory & Development Authority Act was passed on 19 September 2013 and notified on 1 February 2014, thus setting up PFRDA as the regulator for pension sector in India. However, there remains a considerable amount of confusion with other entities like the Employee Provident Fund, pension funds run by life insurers, and mutual fund companies being outside the purview of PFRDA.\n\nThe contributory pension system was notified by the Government of India on 22 December 2003, now named the National Pension System (NPS) with effect from 1 January 2004. The NPS was subsequently extended to all citizens of the country with effect from 1 May 2009, including self-employed professionals and others in the unorganized sector on a voluntary basis.\n\n==Architecture==\nUnlike traditional financial products where all the functions (sales, operations, service, fund management, depository) are done by one company, NPS follows an unbundled architecture where each step of the value chain has been made disjointed from the other. This unbundling not only allows the customer to mix and match his providers of service through the value chain, picking the best-suited option, but it also curbs the incidence of misselling.\n\nNPS architecture consists of the NPS Trust, which is entrusted with safeguarding subscribers' interests, Central Recordkeeping Agencies (CRAs) which maintains the data and records, Point of Presence (POP) as collection, distribution and servicing arms, pension fund managers (PFM) for managing the investments of subscribers, a custodian to take care of the assets purchased by the fund managers, and a trustee bank to manage the banking operations. At age 60 the customer can choose to purchase pension Annuity Service Providers (ASP). NPS investors can't opt for two pension fund managers, neither can switch to another pension fund before a year.  In 2017, PFRDA increased the entry age in NPS to 65 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Money/tdXgBZCrEbrzOUVEBHp3qM/You-can-continue-investing-in-NPS-even-after-retirement.html|title=You can continue investing in NPS even after retirement}}</ref>\n\nThe number of pension fund managers (PFM) has increased to seven in NPS:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Money/LmEMAB8K4qOusRorpNGqIO/Pension-gets-a-stronger-equity-push.html|title=Pension gets a stronger equity push|first=Deepti Bhaskaran & Shaikh Zoaib|last=Saleem|date=27 December 2016|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pick-the-best-nps-funds/articleshow/58567386.cms|title=How to select best NPS funds - Times of India|author=|date=|website=IndiaTimes.com|access-date=17 September 2017}}</ref>\n* SBI Pension Funds\n* LIC Pension Fund\n* UTI Retirement Solutions\n* HDFC Pension Fund\n* ICICI Prudential Pension Fund\n* Kotak Pension Fund\n* Birla Sun Life Pension Management Ltd\n\nSBI Pension Funds is the largest pension fund manager (PFM) in India and its assets under management(AUM) level is Rs 61,000 crore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-pension-funds-eyes-rs-65000-crore-aum-by-endfiscal_8268241.html|title=SBI Pension Funds eyes Rs 65,000 crore AUM by end of fiscal|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt present, central government employees have no say in the matter of choice of fund manager or investment allocation in NPS, as both are decided by the government.

The NPS started with the decision of the Government of India to stop defined benefit pensions for all its employees who joined after 1 January 2004. While the scheme was initially designed for government employees only, it was opened up for all citizens of India in 2009. NPS is an attempt by the government to create a pensioned society in India. In its overall structure NPS is closer to 401(k) plans of the United States. Today, the NPS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nps.karvy.com/|title=National Pension Scheme (NPS) in India|website=Karvy KCRA eNPS}}</ref> is readily available and tax efficient under Section 80CCC and Section 80CCD. Under the NPS, an individual can contribute to his retirement account. Also, his employer can contribute to the welfare and social security of the individual.\n\nNPS is a quasi-EET instrument in India where 40% of the corpus escapes tax at maturity, while 60% of the corpus is taxable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest/how-good-is-the-recently-revamped-nps/articleshow/55632329.cms|title=How good is the recently revamped NPS?}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/now-you-can-open-a-nps-account-completely-online-via-aadhar-without-sending-physical-documents/articleshow/56235215.cms|title=NPS: Now you can open a NPS account completely online via Aadhar without sending physical documents - The Economic Times|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/tax-parity-for-nps-and-epf-members-is-a-welcome-step/articleshow/56387353.cms|title=Tax parity for NPS and EPF members is a welcome step - The Economic Times|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref> Of the 60% taxable corpus, 40% is tax-exempt as it has to be compulsorily used to purchase an [[annuity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2017-arun-jaitley-likely-to-make-national-pension-system-totally-tax-free/509491/|title=Budget 2017: Arun Jaitley likely to make National Pension system totally tax-free|author=|date=16 January 2017|website=FinancialExpress.com|access-date=17 September 2017}}</ref> The [[annuity]] income will be taxed, though.

Based on the recommendations of the OASIS report, the Government of India introduced a new Defined Contribution Pension System for the new entrants to Central/State Government service, except to the Defence forces i.e. Army, Navy and Air Force, replacing the existing system of the Defined Benefit Pension System.\n\nOn 23 August 2003, the Interim Pension Fund Regulatory & Development Authority (PFRDA) was established through a resolution by the Government of India to \"promote old age income security by establishing, developing and regulating pension funds, to protect the interests of subscribers to schemes of pension funds and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\" The Pension Fund Regulatory & Development Authority Act was passed on 19 September 2013 and notified on 1 February 2014, thus setting up PFRDA as the regulator for pension sector in India. However, there remains a considerable amount of confusion with other entities like the Employee Provident Fund, pension funds run by life insurers, and mutual fund companies being outside the purview of PFRDA.\n\nThe contributory pension system was notified by the Government of India on 22 December 2003, now named the National Pension System (NPS) with effect from 1 January 2004. The NPS was subsequently extended to all citizens of the country with effect from 1 May 2009, including self-employed professionals and others in the unorganized sector on a voluntary basis.\n\n==Architecture==\nUnlike traditional financial products where all the functions (sales, operations, service, fund management, depository) are done by one company, NPS follows an unbundled architecture where each step of the value chain has been made disjointed from the other. This unbundling not only allows the customer to mix and match his providers of service through the value chain, picking the best-suited option, but it also curbs the incidence of misselling.\n\nNPS architecture consists of the NPS Trust, which is entrusted with safeguarding subscribers' interests, Central Recordkeeping Agencies (CRAs) which maintains the data and records, Point of Presence (POP) as collection, distribution and servicing arms, pension fund managers (PFM) for managing the investments of subscribers, a custodian to take care of the assets purchased by the fund managers, and a trustee bank to manage the banking operations. At age 60 the customer can choose to purchase pension Annuity Service Providers (ASP). NPS investors can't opt for two pension fund managers, neither can switch to another pension fund before a year.  In 2017, PFRDA increased the entry age in NPS to 65 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Money/tdXgBZCrEbrzOUVEBHp3qM/You-can-continue-investing-in-NPS-even-after-retirement.html|title=You can continue investing in NPS even after retirement}}</ref>\n\nThe number of pension fund managers (PFM) has increased to seven in NPS:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Money/LmEMAB8K4qOusRorpNGqIO/Pension-gets-a-stronger-equity-push.html|title=Pension gets a stronger equity push|first=Deepti Bhaskaran & Shaikh Zoaib|last=Saleem|date=27 December 2016|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pick-the-best-nps-funds/articleshow/58567386.cms|title=How to select best NPS funds - Times of India|author=|date=|website=IndiaTimes.com|access-date=17 September 2017}}</ref>\n* SBI Pension Funds\n* LIC Pension Fund\n* UTI Retirement Solutions\n* HDFC Pension Fund\n* ICICI Prudential Pension Fund\n* Kotak Pension Fund\n* Birla Sun Life Pension Management Ltd\n\nSBI Pension Funds is the largest pension fund manager (PFM) in India and its assets under management(AUM) level is Rs 61,000 crore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-pension-funds-eyes-rs-65000-crore-aum-by-endfiscal_8268241.html|title=SBI Pension Funds eyes Rs 65,000 crore AUM by end of fiscal|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt present, central government employees have no say in the matter of choice of fund manager or investment allocation in NPS, as both are decided by the government.

{"title_page": "List of mammals of India", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Wildlife of India}}\nThis '''list of mammals of India''' comprises all the mammal species alive in India today. Some of them are common to the point of being considered [[vermin]] while others are exceedingly rare. Many species are known from just a few [[zoological specimen]]s in museums collected in the 19th and 20th centuries. Many of the carnivores and larger mammals are restricted in their distribution to forests in protected areas, while others live within cities in the close proximity of humans. They range in size from the [[Eurasian pygmy shrew]] (''Sorex minutus'') to the [[Asian elephant]] (''Elephas maximus''). They include nocturnal small mammals [[endemic]] to India such as the [[Malabar large-spotted civet]] (''Viverra civettina''). While the status of many of these species is unknown, some are definitely extinct. Populations of many carnivores are threatened.

Some of them are common to the point of being considered [[vermin]] while others are exceedingly rare. Many species are known from just a few [[zoological specimen]]s in museums collected in the 19th and 20th centuries. Many of the carnivores and larger mammals are restricted in their distribution to forests in protected areas, while others live within cities in the close proximity of humans. They range in size from the [[Eurasian pygmy shrew]] (''Sorex minutus'') to the [[Asian elephant]] (''Elephas maximus''). They include nocturnal small mammals [[endemic]] to India such as the [[Malabar large-spotted civet]] (''Viverra civettina''). While the status of many of these species is unknown, some are definitely extinct. Populations of many carnivores are threatened. The [[tiger]] (''Panthera tigris''), [[dhole]] (''Cuon alpinus''), [[Malabar large-spotted civet]] (''Viverra civettina'') and [[Himalayan wolf]] (''Canis himalayensis'') are some of the most endangered carnivore species. Two rhinoceros species are extinct within the Indian region but the remaining species has its last stronghold within India. The [[Asiatic cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus venaticus'') was extirpated in India in the 1950s.\n\n==Order: Insectivora ==\n\n===Family Erinaceidae: hedgehogs===\n* [[Indian long-eared hedgehog]] (''Hemiechinus collaris'') {{small|(Gray, 1830)}}\n* [[Brandt's hedgehog]] (''Hemiechinus hypomelas'') {{small|(Brandt, 1836)}}\n* [[Indian hedgehog]] (''Paraechinus micropus'') {{small|(Blyth (1846))}}\n* [[Madras hedgehog]] (''Paraechinus nudiventris'') {{small|(Horsfield, 1851)}} endemic\n\n===Family Talpidae: moles ===\n* [[White-tailed mole]] (''Parascaptor leucura'') {{small|(Blyth, 1850)}}\n* [[Himalayan mole]] (''Euroscaptor micrura'') {{small|(Hodgson, 1841)}}\n\n===Family Soricidae: shrews===\n\n====Soricinae====\n* [[Chinese mole shrew]] (''Anourosorex squamipes'') {{small|Milne-Edwards, 1872}}\n* [[Himalayan water shrew]] (''Chimarrogale himalayica'') {{small|(Gray, 1842)}}\n* [[Elegant water shrew]] (''Nectogale elegans'') {{small|Milne-Edwards, 1870}}\n* [[Eurasian pygmy shrew]] (''Sorex minutus'') {{small|Linnaeus, 1766}}\n* [[Kashmir pygmy shrew]] (''Sorex planiceps'') {{small|Miller, 1911}}\n* [[Hodgson's brown-toothed shrew]] (''Soriculus caudatus'') {{small|(Horsfield, 1851)}}\n* [[Long-tailed brown-toothed shrew]] (''Soriculus leucops'') {{small|(Horsfield, 1851)}}\n* [[Long-tailed mountain shrew]] (''Soriculus macrurus'') {{small|Blanford, 1888}}\n* [[Himalayan shrew]] (''Soriculus nigrescens'') {{small|(Gray, 1842)}}\n\n====Crocidurinae====\n* [[Andaman shrew]] (''Crocidura andamanensis'') {{small|Miller, 1902}}\n* [[Asian grey shrew]] (''Crocidura attenuata'') {{small|Milne-Edwards, 1872}}\n* [[Southeast Asian shrew]] (''Crocidura fuliginosa'') {{small|(Blyth, 1856)}}\n* [[Horsfield's shrew]] (''Crocidura horsfieldii'') {{small|(Tomes, 1856)}}\n* {{extinct}}[[Sonnerat's shrew]] (''Crocidura sonnerati'') {{small|(Cheke, 2011)}}\n* [[Andaman spiny shrew]] (''Crocidura hispida'') {{small|Thomas, 1913}}\n* [[Jenkins's shrew]] (''Crocidura jenkinsi'') {{small|Chakraborthy, 1978}}\n* [[Bicolored shrew]] (''Crocidura leucodon'') {{small|(Zimmermann, 1780)}}\n* [[Nicobar shrew]] (''Crocidura nicobarica'') {{small|Miller, 1902}}\n* [[Pale grey shrew]] (''Crocidura pergrisea'') {{small|Miller, 1913}}\n* [[Kashmir white-toothed shrew]] (''Crocidura pullata'') {{small|Miller, 1911}}\n* [[Kelaart's long-clawed shrew]] (''Feroculus feroculus'') {{small|(Kelaart, 1850)}}\n* [[Day's shrew]] (''Suncus dayi'') {{small|(Dobson, 1888)}} (endemic)\n* [[Etruscan shrew]] (''Suncus etruscus'') {{small|(Savi, 1822)}}\n* [[Asian house shrew]] (''Suncus murinus'') {{small|(Linnaeus, 1766)}}\n* [[Anderson's shrew]] (''Suncus stoliczkanus'') {{small|(Anderson, 1877)}}\n\n==Order: Scandentia==\n\n===Family Tupaiidae: treeshrews===\n[[File:Anathana ellioti.jpg|thumb|Indian tree-shrew (''Anathana ellioti'') in [[Yercaud]], India]]\n\n====Tupaiinae====\n* [[Madras treeshrew]] (''Anathana ellioti'') {{small|(Waterhouse, 1850)}}\n* [[Northern treeshrew]] (''Tupaia belangeri'') {{small|(Wagner, 1841)}}\n* [[Tupaia nicobarica]] (''Tupaia nicobarica'') {{small|(Zelebor, 1869)}}\n\n==Order: Chiroptera: bats==\n\n===Family Pteropodidae: fruit bats ===\n* [[Lesser short-nosed fruit bat]] (''Cynopterus brachyotis'') {{small|(Muller, 1838)}}\n* [[Greater short-nosed fruit bat]] (''Cynopterus sphinx'') {{small|(Vahl, 1797)}}\n* [[Eonycteris spelaea|Lesser dawn bat]] (''Eonycteris spelaea'') {{small|(Dobson, 1871)}}\n* [[Cave nectar bat]] (''Latidens salimalii'') {{small|Thonglongya, 1972}}\n* [[Long-tongued fruit bat]] (''Macroglossus sobrinus'') {{small|K.

It forms the junction of [[Interstate 94 in Wisconsin|Interstate&nbsp;94]] (I-94, East\u2013West Freeway), [[Interstate 894|I-894]], [[Interstate 41|I-41]], [[U.S. Route 41 in Wisconsin|US Highway&nbsp;41]] (US 41) and [[U.S. Route 45 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;45]] (Zoo Freeway). It is the busiest and one of the oldest interchanges in the state. It is nicknamed as such because of the [[Milwaukee County Zoo]] located on the northwest quadrant of the interchange. The [[control cities]] at the interchange are Downtown [[Milwaukee]] to the east, [[Chicago]] to the south, [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] to the west and [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]] to the north.\n\nOriginally completed in 1963, the interchange was a major component in the [[freeway]] system being developed in Milwaukee and southeastern Wisconsin and formed an important link with the [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate system]]. It was considered a wonder of engineering at the time. The design included exits on both the left and right sides of the roadways, and drivers exited depending which side their destination road was on. Owing to the dangers of this design and the deterioration of the interchange, a reconstruction was considered in the early 2000s. Plans set reconstruction in 2015, but it was advanced by Governor Jim Doyle to 2012, then delayed due to lack of available funding. Work finally began in 2014 with an expected completion in 2018. However, further budget issues delayed the completion to 2022.\n\nThe complexity and scale of the reconstruction project necessitated advanced methods of construction. It marked the first time that Wisconsin used drilled shaft foundations to build bridge supports and the first time that 3D computer modelling was used. In 2014 the interchange became the first place in the United States where orange [[Road surface marking|pavement marking]]s were tested.\n\nThe interchange reconstruction has sparked much controversy and political polarization. Opponents have criticized its extremely high $1.7 billion cost. It also continues the area trend of investing heavily in freeways while neglecting all other forms of transportation. This resulted in the Milwaukee Innercity Congregations Allied for Hope and the Black Health Coalition of Wisconsin filing a lawsuit against the department of transportation in 2012. It was resolved in 2014 with the state agreeing to give additional aid to the public transit system.\n\n==History==\n\n===Freeway system construction, post World War II to the 1960s===\nFollowing the end of World War II, the city of Milwaukee began experiencing [[Economic growth|economic]] and [[Population growth|population]] growth. Suburbs of the city were rapidly growing, while jobs and shopping remained in the center of the city. The need for transportation between the two areas caused a large growth in the use of automobiles. Traffic on the city streets doubled from 1945 to 1952. Roads quickly became overloaded resulting in long delays and increased accidents. In 1951, the city hired consultants Amman and Whitney to do a traffic study and find a solution that would satisfy the city's needs for the increasing traffic. The firm recommended the construction of a {{convert|20.4|mi|km|adj=on}} freeway system, which was approved by the city in 1952 and began in 1953.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} A major component of the new highway system was the Zoo Interchange, located to the west of downtown. By the summer of 1963, work crews were in a rush to have the interchange finished by the end of that year's construction season, resulting in its completion that fall. The interchange formed a major connection between the Milwaukee area freeways and the rest of the [[Interstate Highway System]], and its completion was regarded as a milestone for the Milwaukee highway system. Due to the complexity of its design, it was seen as a wonder by the people of Milwaukee. Engineers had debated between a right-hand only design and a directional design, but ultimately chose the directional.<ref name=\"Marvel\">{{cite news |last1 = Glauber |first1 = Bill |title = Once a marvel, Zoo Interchange becomes an artifact |url = http://archive.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/89853362.html/ |access-date = June 30, 2018 |work = [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date = April 3, 2010 }}</ref> This design featured entrance and exit ramps on both sides, such that drivers going to a roadway on the left exited to the left and drivers going to a roadway on the right exited to the right.<ref name=\"Years\">{{cite news |title = Years of construction ahead for Milwaukee area freeways |url = https://www.biztimes.com/2014/magazines/biztimes-milwaukee/past-issues/years-of-construction-ahead-for-milwaukee-area-freeways/ |access-date = June 29, 2018 |work = Milwaukee Business Times |date = March 3, 2014 }}</ref> The maximum capacity was 115,000 vehicles per day.<ref name=\"Sights\">{{cite web |last1 = Hissom |first1 = Doug |title = State sets sights on rebuilding Zoo Interchange |url = https://onmilwaukee.com/buzz/articles/hissom102408.html |website = On Milwaukee |access-date = June 29, 2018 |date = October 24, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Interchange rebuild proposal, 2003\u20132008===\nBy 2003, the freeways in Milwaukee and the greater southeastern Wisconsin area were approaching the end of their useful life. [[Traffic congestion]] on the freeways had greatly increased. Following a study, the Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Committee presented several plans, with the recommended being to upgrade the system over the next 30 years. A key feature of the plan was to widen mainline freeways to include more lanes. This would reduce the congestion problem. The plan also included numerous improvements for interchanges, including the Zoo Interchange.<ref name=\"Southeastern\">{{cite web |title = Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Freeway System Reconstruction Study and Recommended Plan |url = http://maps.sewrpc.org/freewaystudy/pdf_files/2003-06_overview.pdf |publisher = Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Committee |access-date = June 30, 2018 }}</ref> The directional interchange style had become [[deprecated]] due to safety concerns and a lack of [[efficiency]] caused by vehicles that had to move across the highway in both directions.<ref name=\"Years\"/> The plan therefore called for all exits to be relocated to the right side. It also suggested reducing lane endings at interchanges and reconfiguring ramps to allow for travel at a higher speed.<ref name=\"Southeastern\"/> WisDOT originally planned to begin working on the Zoo Interchange after a rebuild of [[Interstate 94 in Wisconsin|I-94]] from Milwaukee to the state line had been completed.

The rate of accidents was two to three times higher than the state average. After concluding its engineering study, WisDOT announced three possible plans for the interchange.<ref name=\"Sights\"/> One option was to rebuild the interchange in place, keeping the design the same at a cost of $960 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|960000000|2008}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}).<ref name=\"Stuck\">{{cite news |last1 = Ryan |first1 = Sean |title = Zoo interchange job stuck in neutral |url = https://dailyreporter.com/2009/06/03/zoo-interchange-job-stuck-in-neutral/ |access-date = June 29, 2018 |work = Daily Reporter |date = June 3, 2009 }}</ref> This would fix the deteriorating state of the infrastructure but would not do anything about the left-hand exits or traffic congestion.<ref name=\"Sights\"/> A second option was to do a full rebuild of the interchange, replacing outdated features to improve safety and widening it to six lanes to reduce congestion, with a cost of $2.16 billion. (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|2160000000|2008}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) The third option was a full rebuild with widening to eight lanes to more adequately reduce congestion.

Options included no-build alternatives, build alternatives, and modernization alternatives. The problems that a new design should address were identified as: the deteriorating condition of the interchange, the dangers of the left side exits, the volume of traffic using the interchange, and traffic volumes expected in the future.<ref name=\"Record\"/>\n\n===No-build alternatives===\nThe no-build alternatives did not involve any construction work being done on the interchange. The first was to simply do nothing. This was eliminated because it did not solve any of the problems. The second was to improve public [[mass transit]] in the region. It included doubling the [[Passenger#Types|revenue miles]] of existing transit systems and establishing new transit systems. This would reduce traffic in the interchange, reducing congestion and extending the structure's life, but it was eliminated because it would not fix safety problems and traffic volumes were still expected to increase in the future. The third alternative was to improve traffic management with [[HOV lanes]], new [[Variable-message sign|driver messaging boards]], increased patrols, and improved access to traffic information. This option was eliminated because it did not solve most of the problems.<ref name=\"Record\"/>\n\n===Build alternatives===\nThe build alternatives involved construction work on the interchange. The first was to replace all of the roadways and structures in the interchange. This would solve the deterioration of the interchange, but would not fix safety or congestion problems, as it would retain the same design. The second option was to make spot improvements to the interchange. This would include repair or replacement of structures and pavement where necessary and reconfiguration of some service roads to improve access and safety. This was eliminated because it did not fix traffic congestion and did not fully solve all of the problems.<ref name=\"Record\"/>\n\n===Modernization alternatives===\nThe modernization alternatives involved completely rebuilding and reconfiguring the interchange to new standards. Two similar versions of a modernization design were proposed. These designs featured all exits on the right, full shoulders on all mainlines and ramps, two lanes on some ramps, and smoother curves to allow greater speed. The primary difference was the number of lanes through the interchange; one design had six, and the other had eight. The six-lane variant was eliminated because it was not expected to adequately handle future traffic volumes. The eight-lane variant would solve all of the problems, and was favored by the department, but it faced opposition by the public because of high costs and environmental impacts. Following [[Hearing (law)|public hearings]], this design was eliminated.<ref name=\"Record\"/>\n\n===Reduced Impacts alternative===\nBased on input from the public, WisDOT took components from several of the eliminated designs to develop a new modernization option, called the Reduced Impacts alternative. This design would still solve all of the problems, but would have a lower cost, less environmental impact, and require significantly less property and utility relocations. The design would have only four lanes on I-94, but included {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=on}} shoulders that would allow it to be increased to six lanes in the future. The design also reduced the number of levels from five to four and eliminated a loop ramp. As the new design would not work with plans for the approach legs from other designs, Reduced Impacts alternative plans were also developed for each leg.<ref name=\"Record\"/>\n\n==Construction methods==\nThe supports for the bridges were built using large diameter drilled shafts. The shafts were {{convert|8-10|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|60-100|ft|m}} deep. The Zoo Interchange was the first project in Wisconsin to use [[Deep foundation#Drilled piles|drilled shafts]]. The use of this method instead of [[Deep foundation#Driven foundation|pilings]] allowed for easier traffic rerouting, reduced installation time, less utility conflicts, less noise and vibrations, and cost savings.<ref name=\"Stronger\">{{cite news |last1 = Summers |first1 = Jody |title = Stronger every day |url = https://www.roadsbridges.com/stronger-every-day |accessdate = July 15, 2018 |work = Roads and Bridges |date = August 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThe bridges were built with two side-by-side steel tub [[girder]]s. This design allowed longer bridges to be built while using fewer lifts, as well as maintaining uniformity with the [[Marquette Interchange|Marquette]] and [[Mitchell Interchange|Mitchell]] interchanges. Due to the {{convert|31|e6lb|kg|}} of steel needed for the project, WisDOT held meetings with steel fabricators and construction contractors to understand the necessary logistics. It was determined that contractors would need to buy from at least two steel manufacturers to obtain the necessary quantity. A [[bill of materials]] was released in advance, giving contractors two to three months to obtain the steel before the work was scheduled to begin. Six 31-hour windows were scheduled for installing beams, and deliveries of beams were coordinated to occur during off-peak traffic times. The use of [[chainfall]]s to guide the beams into place and bigger cranes than expected reduced the time needed to install beams to 12\u201315 hours per window.<ref name=\"Stronger\"/>\n\nThe project marked the first use of 3D modeling software by WisDOT.<ref name=\"Stronger\"/> The department obtained laser mapping units, new desktop, laptop, and tablet computers, and [[GPS]] rovers in preparation of the project. Two [[terabytes]] of data were generated from surveying the site.

On December 2, white and yellow lines were replaced with orange lines at three places in the interchange. The testing was in response to reports of [[Sodium chloride#Road salt|salt]] residue making lines in the work zone difficult to see in the winter. This was especially problematic where [[Road signs in the United States#W24 Series: Lane Shifts|lanes shifted]].<ref name=\"Working\">{{cite web |last1 = Lemoine |first1 = Bret |title = Are they working?

The project required approval from the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA), which originally granted an 18-month test period. This was later extended through the end of the interchange construction. As orange paint would be hard for a contractor to find, and excess could not be used anywhere else, WisDOT decided to supply the paint to contractors. Orange [[Road surface marking#Epoxy|epoxy paint]] was purchased from a manufacturer in Canada and used for the first test. However, by the end of the summer, the paint had faded to yellow. A water-based latex paint was tested next, but this was worn away during the winter. The department therefore decided to use latex paint in the summer and epoxy paint in the winter. Orange [[Road surface marking#Temporary markers|tape markings]] were also tested. A survey of drivers found that 75% liked the orange markings and 25% did not. It was reported that no decrease in worksite accidents was found as a result of the orange markings, but there also was not an increase.<ref name=\"Seeing\">{{cite web |last1 = Heydorn |first1 = Allan |title = Why drivers are seeing orange in Wisconsin |url = https://www.forconstructionpros.com/pavement-maintenance/marking-striping/article/20975121/testing-orange-stripes-in-work-zones |website = For Construction Pros |accessdate = July 22, 2018 |date = October 1, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Lawsuit==\n\n===Background===\nIn August 2012, a lawsuit was filed against the state and federal departments of transportation, alleging that the project was discriminatory.

Urban minorities, who generally did not have cars, would receive no benefit from the expenditure.<ref name=\"Faces\"/> Further, state aid to the public transit that these groups relied on had been decreasing. The results of these decreases included the [[Milwaukee County Transit System]] eliminating 25 bus routes and making reductions to other routes. The suit also argued that the expansion would increase [[air pollution]]. In the region, [[respiratory disease]]s from air pollution already had higher occurrence rates among minorities than Whites.<ref name=\"Sue\"/> The plaintiffs did not oppose the reconstruction of the interchange, but did not want any capacity expansion. They instead wanted the money allocated for expansion to be spent on improvements to public transit.<ref name=\"Faces\"/>\n\n===Preliminary ruling===\nIn May 2013, the court issued an interim ruling in the case. The ruling prevented construction from proceeding until studies on its effects had been completed. The court required the state to perform two studies. The first would look at the environmental effects of expanding the interchange's capacity, especially if future traffic volumes did not meet the state's estimate. The second would look at the social and economical effects on minorities of expanding the interchange's capacity while public transit remained unsupported. Both studies were expected to encompass the entire region. Once the studies were completed, the state would be free to choose whatever course of action it wanted, including continuing with the plan to expand the interchange and allow public transit to decline. However, the decision makers would be required to consider the results of the studies first. The defendant agencies challenged that the studies should only be required in the immediate area of the interchange. This argument was rejected by the court; they believed that the project could have effects on the entire region, not just the areas around the interchange, and the state needed to take these into consideration as well. As the ruling was interim, the case continued to court facilitated mediation before the suit was settled.<ref name=\"Judge\"/>\n\n===Resolution===\nIn May 2014, the two sides reached an agreement in mediation. Under the agreement, WisDOT would pay $13.5 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|13500000|2014}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) over four years for transit services in the Milwaukee area. This would be allocated as $11.5 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|11500000|2014}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) to develop and operate new bus routes, with a focus on routes designed to connect Milwaukee to its suburbs, and $2 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|2000000|2014}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) to make enhancements to transit services. Following the settlement, the Milwaukee County Transit Committee began planning Route 279, a new express bus route that would run from central Milwaukee to Menominee Falls. The new route would cost $245,000 in 2014 and $668,000 in 2015 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US-GDP|245000|2014}}}} and ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US-GDP|668000|2015}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) and would be the first new route funded with the settlement money.<ref name=\"Transit\"/> After the four years of state funding, ridership on all the new routes would have to be analyzed to determine if it would be viable for the county to continue operating them.<ref name=\"Pay\">{{cite web |last1 = Quirmbach |first1 = Chuck |title = DOT will pay $13M in Milwaukee Zoo Interchange lawsuit settlement |url = https://www.wpr.org/dot-will-pay-13m-milwaukee-zoo-interchange-lawsuit-settlement |publisher = [[Wisconsin Public Radio]] |accessdate = August 6, 2018 |date = May 20, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Controversy and criticism==\nThe $1.7 billion dollar cost of rebuilding the interchange used two years worth of the state's budget for highway repairs and 15 years worth of public transit aid.

The number of vehicles on the streets increased by between 63 and 109 percent from what it was before the construction. A 2016 survey conducted by the city found that residents were concerned by the amount of traffic. The higher traffic volumes increased wear on the streets and prevented the city from doing a rebuild of North Avenue. The delay of completion of the north leg has caused concern for city officials as it interfered with plans for work on North Avenue, requiring further postponement of improvements to the deteriorating road. In February 2017, the city council sent a letter to the state legislature requesting that the completion not be delayed.<ref name=\"Urge\">{{cite news |last1 = Barlow |first1 = Chris |title = Wauwatosa officials urge state to complete Zoo Interchange on time |url = https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2017/03/21/wauwatosa-officials-urge-state-complete-zoo-interchange-project-schedule/99314760/ |accessdate = August 12, 2018 |work = Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date = March 21, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nThe Zoo Interchange reconstruction has showcased the conflict of political ideas in the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]]. Studies have found the area to be one of the most [[Geographical segregation|segregated]] in the country, with almost all minorities living in the city and the suburbs primarily White.<ref name=\"Overpasses\"/> Residents of the suburbs advocate in favor of highways while not supporting any other form of transportation. Residents of the city want a more diverse transportation system.<ref name=\"Faces\"/> The Republican suburbs have gained power in regional politics and pushed their transportation ideas, leading to proposals for bus lanes and several types of rail systems being vetoed.<ref name=\"Overpasses\"/> Following the bridge closure at the Zoo Interchange, county executive [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] criticized Governor Doyle and Milwaukee Mayor [[Tom Barrett (Wisconsin politician)|Tom Barrett]] for supporting an $810 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|810000000|2010}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) rail line when the highway infrastructure was so deteriorated.<ref name=\"Cracks\"/> Since being elected governor, Walker has allocated huge amounts of money to freeway [[megaprojects]], exemplified by the $1.7 billion Zoo Interchange reconstruction. Residents of the city have complained that this is excessive, and the costs of the projects are not justified by the few minutes that they save commuters, especially while local road aid and education have received funding cuts.<ref name=\"Overpasses\"/> The city's opposition to the highway only idea of the suburbs culminated with the 2012 lawsuit, forcing the state to give more money to public transit.<ref name=\"Faces\"/>\n\nIn 1997, Milwaukee County legislators attempted to create a compromise that would support both transportation visions. An extensive study of numerous options revealed that legislators were divided into two distinct groups. One wanted only freeways, the other wanted only alternative transit options. A $1.86 billion (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|1860000000|1997}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) deal was proposed that would benefit both groups. It would give $460 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|460000000|1997}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) to rebuild the Marquette Interchange and $610 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|610000000|1997}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) for the Zoo Interchange and other I-94 improvements. It would also give $250 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|250000000|1997}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) for constructing HOV and bus lanes, $444 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|440000000|1997}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) for a light rail system, and $90 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|90000000|1997}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) to improve bus service. Under this plan, the Marquette Interchange would have been rebuilt from 2001 to 2004, the light rail would have been constructed from 2002 to 2006, and the Zoo Interchange rebuild and other freeway work would have occurred from 2008 to 2013. However, disputes arose about how each component of the project would be paid for, with each group trying to block funding for the other's concessions. The compromise eventually fell apart and each group began to work individually to push their own agenda.<ref name=\"Derailed\">{{cite news |last1 = Sandler |first1 = Larry |last2 = Held |first2 = Tom |title = Transit fight derailed previous plans on Zoo Interchange |url = http://archive.jsonline.com/newswatch/90585029.html |accessdate = September 3, 2018 |work = Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date = April 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://projects.511wi.gov/web/zoo-interchange-project/home Zoo Interchange Project official site]\n\n[[Category:Transportation in Milwaukee]]\n[[Category:Interstate 94]]\n[[Category:Road interchanges in the United States]]\n[[Category:U.S. Route 45]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2018}}\n{{about|the highway junction in Milwaukee|the railroad junction in Philadelphia|Zoo Junction}}\n{{Infobox road junction\n|country=USA\n|name=Zoo Interchange\n|type=Interchange\n|image=\n|image_caption=Aerial view of the Zoo Interchange\n|maint=[[Wisconsin Department of Transportation|WisDOT]]\n|location=[[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]\n|coord={{coord|43.0275|-88.034444|format=dms}}\n|roads={{jct|state=WI|I|41|US|41}}<br/>{{Jct|state=WI|I|94}}<br/>{{Jct|state=WI|I|894}}<br/>{{Jct|state=WI|US|45}}\n|opened={{start date|1963}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Zoo Interchange''' is a freeway [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] on the west side of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. It forms the junction of [[Interstate 94 in Wisconsin|Interstate&nbsp;94]] (I-94, East\u2013West Freeway), [[Interstate 894|I-894]], [[Interstate 41|I-41]], [[U.S. Route 41 in Wisconsin|US Highway&nbsp;41]] (US 41) and [[U.S. Route 45 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;45]] (Zoo Freeway). It is the busiest and one of the oldest interchanges in the state. It is nicknamed as such because of the [[Milwaukee County Zoo]] located on the northwest quadrant of the interchange. The [[control cities]] at the interchange are Downtown [[Milwaukee]] to the east, [[Chicago]] to the south, [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] to the west and [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]] to the north.\n\nOriginally completed in 1963, the interchange was a major component in the [[freeway]] system being developed in Milwaukee and southeastern Wisconsin and formed an important link with the [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate system]]. It was considered a wonder of engineering at the time. The design included exits on both the left and right sides of the roadways, and drivers exited depending which side their destination road was on. Owing to the dangers of this design and the deterioration of the interchange, a reconstruction was considered in the early 2000s. Plans set reconstruction in 2015, but it was advanced by Governor Jim Doyle to 2012, then delayed due to lack of available funding. Work finally began in 2014 with an expected completion in 2018. However, further budget issues delayed the completion to 2022.\n\nThe complexity and scale of the reconstruction project necessitated advanced methods of construction. It marked the first time that Wisconsin used drilled shaft foundations to build bridge supports and the first time that 3D computer modelling was used. In 2014 the interchange became the first place in the United States where orange [[Road surface marking|pavement marking]]s were tested.\n\nThe interchange reconstruction has sparked much controversy and political polarization. Opponents have criticized its extremely high $1.7 billion cost. It also continues the area trend of investing heavily in freeways while neglecting all other forms of transportation. This resulted in the Milwaukee Innercity Congregations Allied for Hope and the Black Health Coalition of Wisconsin filing a lawsuit against the department of transportation in 2012. It was resolved in 2014 with the state agreeing to give additional aid to the public transit system.\n\n==History==\n\n===Freeway system construction, post World War II to the 1960s===\nFollowing the end of World War II, the city of Milwaukee began experiencing [[Economic growth|economic]] and [[Population growth|population]] growth. Suburbs of the city were rapidly growing, while jobs and shopping remained in the center of the city. The need for transportation between the two areas caused a large growth in the use of automobiles. Traffic on the city streets doubled from 1945 to 1952. Roads quickly became overloaded resulting in long delays and increased accidents. In 1951, the city hired consultants Amman and Whitney to do a traffic study and find a solution that would satisfy the city's needs for the increasing traffic. The firm recommended the construction of a {{convert|20.4|mi|km|adj=on}} freeway system, which was approved by the city in 1952 and began in 1953.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} A major component of the new highway system was the Zoo Interchange, located to the west of downtown. By the summer of 1963, work crews were in a rush to have the interchange finished by the end of that year's construction season, resulting in its completion that fall. The interchange formed a major connection between the Milwaukee area freeways and the rest of the [[Interstate Highway System]], and its completion was regarded as a milestone for the Milwaukee highway system. Due to the complexity of its design, it was seen as a wonder by the people of Milwaukee. Engineers had debated between a right-hand only design and a directional design, but ultimately chose the directional.<ref name=\"Marvel\">{{cite news |last1 = Glauber |first1 = Bill |title = Once a marvel, Zoo Interchange becomes an artifact |url = http://archive.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/89853362.html/ |access-date = June 30, 2018 |work = [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date = April 3, 2010 }}</ref> This design featured entrance and exit ramps on both sides, such that drivers going to a roadway on the left exited to the left and drivers going to a roadway on the right exited to the right.<ref name=\"Years\">{{cite news |title = Years of construction ahead for Milwaukee area freeways |url = https://www.biztimes.com/2014/magazines/biztimes-milwaukee/past-issues/years-of-construction-ahead-for-milwaukee-area-freeways/ |access-date = June 29, 2018 |work = Milwaukee Business Times |date = March 3, 2014 }}</ref> The maximum capacity was 115,000 vehicles per day.<ref name=\"Sights\">{{cite web |last1 = Hissom |first1 = Doug |title = State sets sights on rebuilding Zoo Interchange |url = https://onmilwaukee.com/buzz/articles/hissom102408.html |website = On Milwaukee |access-date = June 29, 2018 |date = October 24, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Interchange rebuild proposal, 2003\u20132008===\nBy 2003, the freeways in Milwaukee and the greater southeastern Wisconsin area were approaching the end of their useful life. [[Traffic congestion]] on the freeways had greatly increased. Following a study, the Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Committee presented several plans, with the recommended being to upgrade the system over the next 30 years. A key feature of the plan was to widen mainline freeways to include more lanes. This would reduce the congestion problem. The plan also included numerous improvements for interchanges, including the Zoo Interchange.<ref name=\"Southeastern\">{{cite web |title = Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Freeway System Reconstruction Study and Recommended Plan |url = http://maps.sewrpc.org/freewaystudy/pdf_files/2003-06_overview.pdf |publisher = Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Committee |access-date = June 30, 2018 }}</ref> The directional interchange style had become [[deprecated]] due to safety concerns and a lack of [[efficiency]] caused by vehicles that had to move across the highway in both directions.<ref name=\"Years\"/> The plan therefore called for all exits to be relocated to the right side.

Options included no-build alternatives, build alternatives, and modernization alternatives. The problems that a new design should address were identified as: the deteriorating condition of the interchange, the dangers of the left side exits, the volume of traffic using the interchange, and traffic volumes expected in the future.<ref name=\"Record\"/>\n\n===No-build alternatives===\nThe no-build alternatives did not involve any construction work being done on the interchange. The first was to simply do nothing. This was eliminated because it did not solve any of the problems. The second was to improve public [[mass transit]] in the region. It included doubling the [[Passenger#Types|revenue miles]] of existing transit systems and establishing new transit systems. This would reduce traffic in the interchange, reducing congestion and extending the structure's life, but it was eliminated because it would not fix safety problems and traffic volumes were still expected to increase in the future. The third alternative was to improve traffic management with [[HOV lanes]], new [[Variable-message sign|driver messaging boards]], increased patrols, and improved access to traffic information. This option was eliminated because it did not solve most of the problems.<ref name=\"Record\"/>\n\n===Build alternatives===\nThe build alternatives involved construction work on the interchange. The first was to replace all of the roadways and structures in the interchange. This would solve the deterioration of the interchange, but would not fix safety or congestion problems, as it would retain the same design. The second option was to make spot improvements to the interchange. This would include repair or replacement of structures and pavement where necessary and reconfiguration of some service roads to improve access and safety. This was eliminated because it did not fix traffic congestion and did not fully solve all of the problems.<ref name=\"Record\"/>\n\n===Modernization alternatives===\nThe modernization alternatives involved completely rebuilding and reconfiguring the interchange to new standards. Two similar versions of a modernization design were proposed. These designs featured all exits on the right, full shoulders on all mainlines and ramps, two lanes on some ramps, and smoother curves to allow greater speed. The primary difference was the number of lanes through the interchange; one design had six, and the other had eight. The six-lane variant was eliminated because it was not expected to adequately handle future traffic volumes. The eight-lane variant would solve all of the problems, and was favored by the department, but it faced opposition by the public because of high costs and environmental impacts. Following [[Hearing (law)|public hearings]], this design was eliminated.<ref name=\"Record\"/>\n\n===Reduced Impacts alternative===\nBased on input from the public, WisDOT took components from several of the eliminated designs to develop a new modernization option, called the Reduced Impacts alternative. This design would still solve all of the problems, but would have a lower cost, less environmental impact, and require significantly less property and utility relocations. The design would have only four lanes on I-94, but included {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=on}} shoulders that would allow it to be increased to six lanes in the future. The design also reduced the number of levels from five to four and eliminated a loop ramp. As the new design would not work with plans for the approach legs from other designs, Reduced Impacts alternative plans were also developed for each leg.<ref name=\"Record\"/>\n\n==Construction methods==\nThe supports for the bridges were built using large diameter drilled shafts. The shafts were {{convert|8-10|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|60-100|ft|m}} deep. The Zoo Interchange was the first project in Wisconsin to use [[Deep foundation#Drilled piles|drilled shafts]]. The use of this method instead of [[Deep foundation#Driven foundation|pilings]] allowed for easier traffic rerouting, reduced installation time, less utility conflicts, less noise and vibrations, and cost savings.<ref name=\"Stronger\">{{cite news |last1 = Summers |first1 = Jody |title = Stronger every day |url = https://www.roadsbridges.com/stronger-every-day |accessdate = July 15, 2018 |work = Roads and Bridges |date = August 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThe bridges were built with two side-by-side steel tub [[girder]]s. This design allowed longer bridges to be built while using fewer lifts, as well as maintaining uniformity with the [[Marquette Interchange|Marquette]] and [[Mitchell Interchange|Mitchell]] interchanges. Due to the {{convert|31|e6lb|kg|}} of steel needed for the project, WisDOT held meetings with steel fabricators and construction contractors to understand the necessary logistics. It was determined that contractors would need to buy from at least two steel manufacturers to obtain the necessary quantity. A [[bill of materials]] was released in advance, giving contractors two to three months to obtain the steel before the work was scheduled to begin. Six 31-hour windows were scheduled for installing beams, and deliveries of beams were coordinated to occur during off-peak traffic times. The use of [[chainfall]]s to guide the beams into place and bigger cranes than expected reduced the time needed to install beams to 12\u201315 hours per window.<ref name=\"Stronger\"/>\n\nThe project marked the first use of 3D modeling software by WisDOT.<ref name=\"Stronger\"/> The department obtained laser mapping units, new desktop, laptop, and tablet computers, and [[GPS]] rovers in preparation of the project. Two [[terabytes]] of data were generated from surveying the site. [[Computer-aided design|Computer-generated models]] of the new interchange design could then be created.<ref name=\"Orchestrates\">{{cite web |last1 = Zeyher |first1 = Allen |title = Wisconsin orchestrates a model road rebuild |url = https://www.enr.com/articles/11133-wisconsin-orchestrates-a-model-road-rebuild?page=1 |website = ENR Midwest |accessdate = July 22, 2018 |date = July 17, 2015 }}</ref> The models were uploaded to GPS rovers at the site which used them to search for any conflicts with utilities.

On December 2, white and yellow lines were replaced with orange lines at three places in the interchange. The testing was in response to reports of [[Sodium chloride#Road salt|salt]] residue making lines in the work zone difficult to see in the winter. This was especially problematic where [[Road signs in the United States#W24 Series: Lane Shifts|lanes shifted]].<ref name=\"Working\">{{cite web |last1 = Lemoine |first1 = Bret |title = Are they working?

This was the first time orange markings were used in the United States,<ref name=\"Working\"/> although they had already been used successfully in other countries. The project required approval from the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA), which originally granted an 18-month test period. This was later extended through the end of the interchange construction. As orange paint would be hard for a contractor to find, and excess could not be used anywhere else, WisDOT decided to supply the paint to contractors. Orange [[Road surface marking#Epoxy|epoxy paint]] was purchased from a manufacturer in Canada and used for the first test. However, by the end of the summer, the paint had faded to yellow. A water-based latex paint was tested next, but this was worn away during the winter. The department therefore decided to use latex paint in the summer and epoxy paint in the winter. Orange [[Road surface marking#Temporary markers|tape markings]] were also tested. A survey of drivers found that 75% liked the orange markings and 25% did not. It was reported that no decrease in worksite accidents was found as a result of the orange markings, but there also was not an increase.<ref name=\"Seeing\">{{cite web |last1 = Heydorn |first1 = Allan |title = Why drivers are seeing orange in Wisconsin |url = https://www.forconstructionpros.com/pavement-maintenance/marking-striping/article/20975121/testing-orange-stripes-in-work-zones |website = For Construction Pros |accessdate = July 22, 2018 |date = October 1, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Lawsuit==\n\n===Background===\nIn August 2012, a lawsuit was filed against the state and federal departments of transportation, alleging that the project was discriminatory. The suit was filed in the district court in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] by lawyers from the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Wisconsin and the Midwest Environmental Advocates on behalf of the Milwaukee Innercity Congregations Allied for Hope and the Black Health Coalition of Wisconsin.<ref name=\"Sue\">{{cite news |last1 = Sandler |first1 = Larry |title = Groups sue to block reconstruction of the Zoo Interchange |url = http://archive.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/groups-sue-to-block-reconstruction-of-the-zoo-interchange-dj6ehfo-165653316.html/ |accessdate = August 6, 2018 |work = Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date = August 9, 2012 }}</ref> The plaintiffs argued that the huge amounts of money being spent on expanding the freeways at the interchange would only benefit commuters from the mainly White suburbs. Urban minorities, who generally did not have cars, would receive no benefit from the expenditure.<ref name=\"Faces\"/> Further, state aid to the public transit that these groups relied on had been decreasing. The results of these decreases included the [[Milwaukee County Transit System]] eliminating 25 bus routes and making reductions to other routes. The suit also argued that the expansion would increase [[air pollution]]. In the region, [[respiratory disease]]s from air pollution already had higher occurrence rates among minorities than Whites.<ref name=\"Sue\"/> The plaintiffs did not oppose the reconstruction of the interchange, but did not want any capacity expansion. They instead wanted the money allocated for expansion to be spent on improvements to public transit.<ref name=\"Faces\"/>\n\n===Preliminary ruling===\nIn May 2013, the court issued an interim ruling in the case. The ruling prevented construction from proceeding until studies on its effects had been completed. The court required the state to perform two studies. The first would look at the environmental effects of expanding the interchange's capacity, especially if future traffic volumes did not meet the state's estimate. The second would look at the social and economical effects on minorities of expanding the interchange's capacity while public transit remained unsupported. Both studies were expected to encompass the entire region. Once the studies were completed, the state would be free to choose whatever course of action it wanted, including continuing with the plan to expand the interchange and allow public transit to decline. However, the decision makers would be required to consider the results of the studies first. The defendant agencies challenged that the studies should only be required in the immediate area of the interchange. This argument was rejected by the court; they believed that the project could have effects on the entire region, not just the areas around the interchange, and the state needed to take these into consideration as well. As the ruling was interim, the case continued to court facilitated mediation before the suit was settled.<ref name=\"Judge\"/>\n\n===Resolution===\nIn May 2014, the two sides reached an agreement in mediation. Under the agreement, WisDOT would pay $13.5 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|13500000|2014}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) over four years for transit services in the Milwaukee area. This would be allocated as $11.5 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|11500000|2014}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) to develop and operate new bus routes, with a focus on routes designed to connect Milwaukee to its suburbs, and $2 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|2000000|2014}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) to make enhancements to transit services. Following the settlement, the Milwaukee County Transit Committee began planning Route 279, a new express bus route that would run from central Milwaukee to Menominee Falls. The new route would cost $245,000 in 2014 and $668,000 in 2015 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US-GDP|245000|2014}}}} and ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US-GDP|668000|2015}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) and would be the first new route funded with the settlement money.<ref name=\"Transit\"/> After the four years of state funding, ridership on all the new routes would have to be analyzed to determine if it would be viable for the county to continue operating them.<ref name=\"Pay\">{{cite web |last1 = Quirmbach |first1 = Chuck |title = DOT will pay $13M in Milwaukee Zoo Interchange lawsuit settlement |url = https://www.wpr.org/dot-will-pay-13m-milwaukee-zoo-interchange-lawsuit-settlement |publisher = [[Wisconsin Public Radio]] |accessdate = August 6, 2018 |date = May 20, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Controversy and criticism==\nThe $1.7 billion dollar cost of rebuilding the interchange used two years worth of the state's budget for highway repairs and 15 years worth of public transit aid. It also resulted in a $250 million cut from the [[University of Wisconsin system]] and a decrease in aid for local road repairs.

Plans included expanding Blue Mound Road in [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin|Wauwatosa]] to ten lanes, including three through lanes and three left turn lanes. This would eliminate on street parking, which would present challenges to local businesses. The intersecting Mayfair Road would be increased to 11 lanes. Already considered one of the busiest in the state, the intersection would see a major increase in traffic volume. Area residents feared the increased traffic would create safety hazards and overflow into the surrounding neighborhoods.<ref name=\"Streets\">{{cite news |last1 = Held |first1 = Tom |title = Zoo Interchange plan affects Wauwatosa streets |url = http://archive.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/118750919.html |accessdate = July 22, 2018 |work = Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date = March 27, 2011 }}</ref> Similar expansion plans on Wisconsin Avenue would cut into residential properties along the street.<ref name=\"Resigned\">{{cite news |last1 = Olson |first1 = Jon |title = Wauwatosa neighbors resigned, if unhappy, with DOTs Mayfair road plans |url = http://archive.wauwatosanow.com/news/wauwatosa-neighbors-resigned-if-unhappy-with-dots-mayfair-plans-gc8h438-188731051.html/ |accessdate = July 22, 2018 |work = Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date = January 28, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe city of Wauwatosa has suffered adverse effects from the volumes of traffic being diverted onto the city streets by the construction. The number of vehicles on the streets increased by between 63 and 109 percent from what it was before the construction. A 2016 survey conducted by the city found that residents were concerned by the amount of traffic. The higher traffic volumes increased wear on the streets and prevented the city from doing a rebuild of North Avenue. The delay of completion of the north leg has caused concern for city officials as it interfered with plans for work on North Avenue, requiring further postponement of improvements to the deteriorating road. In February 2017, the city council sent a letter to the state legislature requesting that the completion not be delayed.<ref name=\"Urge\">{{cite news |last1 = Barlow |first1 = Chris |title = Wauwatosa officials urge state to complete Zoo Interchange on time |url = https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2017/03/21/wauwatosa-officials-urge-state-complete-zoo-interchange-project-schedule/99314760/ |accessdate = August 12, 2018 |work = Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date = March 21, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nThe Zoo Interchange reconstruction has showcased the conflict of political ideas in the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]]. Studies have found the area to be one of the most [[Geographical segregation|segregated]] in the country, with almost all minorities living in the city and the suburbs primarily White.<ref name=\"Overpasses\"/> Residents of the suburbs advocate in favor of highways while not supporting any other form of transportation. Residents of the city want a more diverse transportation system.<ref name=\"Faces\"/> The Republican suburbs have gained power in regional politics and pushed their transportation ideas, leading to proposals for bus lanes and several types of rail systems being vetoed.<ref name=\"Overpasses\"/> Following the bridge closure at the Zoo Interchange, county executive [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] criticized Governor Doyle and Milwaukee Mayor [[Tom Barrett (Wisconsin politician)|Tom Barrett]] for supporting an $810 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|810000000|2010}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) rail line when the highway infrastructure was so deteriorated.<ref name=\"Cracks\"/> Since being elected governor, Walker has allocated huge amounts of money to freeway [[megaprojects]], exemplified by the $1.7 billion Zoo Interchange reconstruction. Residents of the city have complained that this is excessive, and the costs of the projects are not justified by the few minutes that they save commuters, especially while local road aid and education have received funding cuts.<ref name=\"Overpasses\"/> The city's opposition to the highway only idea of the suburbs culminated with the 2012 lawsuit, forcing the state to give more money to public transit.<ref name=\"Faces\"/>\n\nIn 1997, Milwaukee County legislators attempted to create a compromise that would support both transportation visions. An extensive study of numerous options revealed that legislators were divided into two distinct groups. One wanted only freeways, the other wanted only alternative transit options. A $1.86 billion (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|1860000000|1997}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) deal was proposed that would benefit both groups. It would give $460 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|460000000|1997}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) to rebuild the Marquette Interchange and $610 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|610000000|1997}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) for the Zoo Interchange and other I-94 improvements. It would also give $250 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|250000000|1997}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) for constructing HOV and bus lanes, $444 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|440000000|1997}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) for a light rail system, and $90 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|90000000|1997}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) to improve bus service. Under this plan, the Marquette Interchange would have been rebuilt from 2001 to 2004, the light rail would have been constructed from 2002 to 2006, and the Zoo Interchange rebuild and other freeway work would have occurred from 2008 to 2013. However, disputes arose about how each component of the project would be paid for, with each group trying to block funding for the other's concessions. The compromise eventually fell apart and each group began to work individually to push their own agenda.<ref name=\"Derailed\">{{cite news |last1 = Sandler |first1 = Larry |last2 = Held |first2 = Tom |title = Transit fight derailed previous plans on Zoo Interchange |url = http://archive.jsonline.com/newswatch/90585029.html |accessdate = September 3, 2018 |work = Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date = April 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://projects.511wi.gov/web/zoo-interchange-project/home Zoo Interchange Project official site]\n\n[[Category:Transportation in Milwaukee]]\n[[Category:Interstate 94]]\n[[Category:Road interchanges in the United States]]\n[[Category:U.S. Route 45]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCore construction, 2014\u20132018:Typo fixing, replaced: sumbits \u2192 submits per source", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_Interchange"}

In telecommunications, IVR allows customers to interact with a company\u2019s host system via a telephone keypad or by speech recognition, after which services can be inquired about through the IVR dialogue. IVR systems can respond with pre-recorded or dynamically generated audio to further direct users on how to proceed. IVR systems deployed in the network are sized to handle large call volumes and also used for outbound calling, as IVR systems are more intelligent than many [[predictive dialer]] systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/future-of-communications/2015/04/20/enhancing-customer-engagement-with-interactive-voice-response/#gref|title=Enhancing customer engagement with interactive voice response|publisher=The Next Web|author=Tolentino, Jamie}}</ref>\n\nIVR systems can be used for mobile purchases, banking payments, services, retail orders, utilities, travel information and weather conditions. A common misconception refers to an [[automated attendant]] as an IVR. The terms are distinct and mean different things to traditional telecommunications professionals\u2014the purpose of an IVR is to take input, process it, and return a result, whereas that of an automated attendant is to route calls. The term '''voice response unit''' ('''VRU''') is sometimes used as well.<ref>{{cite book | isbn=9780471216667 | title=Implementing Voice Over IP | first=Bhumip | last=Khasnabish | location=Lexington, Massachusetts, USA | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nmbexusn9q4C&pg=PA203&dq=vru+ivr&cd=9#v=onepage&q=vru%20ivr&f=false | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.| page=203 | accessdate=21 March 2012 | date=2003-05-30}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nDespite the increase in IVR technology during the 1970s, the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers.<ref>{{Cite news|title=History of a business revolution at the end of a phone|publisher=Scotland On Sunday|author=Harrington, Anthony}}</ref> The first commercial application of IVR was an order entry inventory control system designed and developed by Steven Schmidt in 1973. Early voice response systems were DSP technology based and limited to small vocabularies. In the early 1980s, Leon Ferber's Perception Technology became the first mainstream market competitor, after hard drive technology (read/write random-access to digitized voice data) had reached a cost-effective price point.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} At that time, a system could store digitized speech on disk, play the appropriate spoken message, and process the human's DTMF response.\n\nAs call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s, companies started to invest in [[computer telephony integration]] (CTI) with IVR systems. IVR became vital for call centers deploying universal queuing and routing solutions and acted as an agent which collected customer data to enable intelligent routing decisions. With improvements in technology, systems could use speaker-independent voice recognition of a limited vocabulary instead of requiring the person to use DTMF signaling.\n\nStarting in the 2000s, voice response became more common and cheaper to deploy. This was due to increased [[Central processing unit|CPU]] power and the migration of speech applications from proprietary code to the [[VoiceXML|VXML]] standard.\n\n== Technology ==\n[[DTMF]] decoding and [[VOICE recognition]] are used to interpret the caller's response to voice prompts. DTMF tones are entered via the [[telephone keypad]].\n\nOther technologies include using [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] (TTS) to speak complex and dynamic information, such as e-mails, news reports or weather information. IVR technology is also being introduced into automobile systems for hands-free operation. TTS is computer generated synthesized speech that is no longer the robotic voice traditionally associated with computers. Real voices create the speech in fragments that are spliced together (concatenated) and smoothed before being played to the caller.\n\nAn IVR can be deployed in several ways:\n\n# Equipment installed on the customer premises\n# Equipment installed in the PSTN (public switched telephone network)\n# [[Application service provider]] (ASP) / hosted IVR\n\nAn [[automatic call distributor]] (ACD) is often the first point of contact when calling many larger businesses. An ACD uses digital storage devices to play greetings or announcements, but typically routes a caller without prompting for input. An IVR can play announcements and request an input from the caller. This information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set. (A skill set is a function applied to a group of call-center agents with a particular skill.)\n\nInteractive voice response can be used to front-end a [[call center]] operation by identifying the needs of the caller. Information can be obtained from the caller such as an account number. Answers to simple questions such as account balances or pre-recorded information can be provided without operator intervention. Account numbers from the IVR are often compared to [[caller ID]] data for security reasons and additional IVR responses are required if the caller ID does not match the account record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/interactive-voice-response.htm|title=How Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Works|publisher=How Stuff Works|author=Dave Roos}}</ref>\n\nIVR call flows are created in a variety of ways. A traditional IVR depended upon proprietary programming or scripting languages, whereas modern IVR applications are generated in a similar way to [[World Wide Web|Web]] pages, using standards such as [[VoiceXML]],<ref name=\"VXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml21 | title = Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) Version 2.1 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> [[CCXML]],<ref name=\"CCXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/ccxml | title = Voice Browser Call Control: CCXML Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C }}</ref> [[SRGS]]<ref name=\"SRGS\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar | title = Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> and [[Speech Synthesis Markup Language|SSML]].<ref name=\"SSML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis | title = Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> The ability to use XML-driven applications allows a [[web server]] to act as the [[application server]], freeing the IVR developer to focus on the call flow.\n\nIVR speech recognition interactions (call flows) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input: directed, open-ended, and mixed dialogue.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\">{{cite book\n | last = Suendermann\n | first = David\n | title = Advances in Commercial Deployment of Spoken Dialog Systems\n | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]]\n | location = Berlin\n | date = 2011\n | pages = 9\u201311\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\">{{cite book\n | last = Perez-Marin\n | first = Diana\n | title = Conversational Agents and Natural Language Interaction: Techniques and Effective Practices\n | publisher = IGI Global\n | location = Hershey, Pennsylvania\n | date = 2011\n | page = 340\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\">{{cite web\n | title = Presentation of Information - Aurally\n | publisher = W3C\n | url = https://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml/#s6.5\n | access-date = 26 October 2016\n }}</ref>\n\nA directed dialogue prompt communicates a set of valid responses to the user (e.g. \"How can I help you? ... Say something like, ''account balance, order status,'' or ''more options''\"). An open-ended prompt does not communicate a set of valid responses (e.g. \"How can I help you?\"). In both cases, the goal is to glean a valid spoken response from the user. The key difference is that with directed dialogue, the user is more likely to speak an option exactly as was communicated by the prompt (e.g. \"account balance\"). With an open-ended prompt, however, the user is likely to include extraneous words or phrases (e.g. \"I was just looking at my bill and saw that my balance was wrong.\"). The open-ended prompt requires a greater degree of [[natural language processing]] to extract the relevant information from the phrase (i.e. \"balance\"). Open-ended recognition also requires a larger [[grammar]] set, which accounts for a wider array of permutations of a given response (e.g. \"balance was wrong\", \"wrong balance\", \"balance is high\", \"high balance\"). Despite the greater amount of data and processing required for open-ended prompts, they are more interactively efficient, as the prompts themselves are typically much shorter.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\"/>\n\nA mixed dialogue approach involves shifting from open-ended to directed dialogue or vice versa within the same interaction, as one type of prompt may be more effective in a given situation. Mixed dialog prompts must also be able to recognize responses that are not relevant to the immediate prompt, for instance in the case of a user deciding to shift to a function different from the current one.<ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\"/><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\"/>\n\nHigher level IVR development tools are available to further simplify the application development process. A call flow diagram can be drawn with a GUI tool and the presentation layer (typically VoiceXML) can be automatically generated. In addition, these tools normally provide extension mechanisms for software integration, such as an HTTP interface to a website and a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] interface for connecting to a database.\n\nIn [[telecommunications]], an '''audio response unit''' (ARU) is a device that provides synthesized voice responses to DTMF keypresses by processing calls based on (a) the call-originator input, (b) information received from a database, and (c) information in the incoming call, such as the time of day. ARUs increase the number of information calls handled and provide consistent quality in information retrieval.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Usage ==\nIVR systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost. The use of IVR allows callers' queries to be resolved without a live agent. If callers do not find the information they need, the calls may be transferred to a live agent. The approach allows live agents to have more time to deal with complex interactions. When an IVR system answers multiple phone numbers, the use of [[DNIS]] ensures that the correct application and language is executed. A single large IVR system can handle calls for thousands of applications, each with its own phone numbers and script.\n\nCall centers use IVR systems to identify and segment callers. The ability to identify customers allows services to be tailored according to the customer profile. The caller can be given the option to wait in the queue, choose an automated service, or request a callback. The system may obtain [[caller line identification]] (CLI) data from the network to help identify or authenticate the caller. Additional caller authentication data could include account number, personal information, password and biometrics (such as voice print). IVR also enables customer prioritization. In a system wherein individual customers may have a different status, the service will automatically prioritize the individual's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue.\n\nIVRs will also log call detail information into its own database for auditing, performance report, and future IVR system enhancements. [[Computer telephony integration|CTI]] allows a contact center or organization to gather information about the caller as a means of directing the inquiry to the appropriate agent. CTI can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the IVR dialog from the IVR to the agent desktop using a [[Screen pop|screen-pop]], making for a more effective and efficient service. Voice-activated dialing (VAD) IVR systems are used to automate routine inquiries to a switchboard or [[PABX]] (Private Automatic Branch exchange) operators, and are used in many hospitals and large businesses to reduce the caller waiting time. An additional function is the ability to allow external callers to page staff and transfer the inbound call to the paged person. IVR can be used to provide a more sophisticated [[voice mail]] experience to the caller.\n\n===Banking===\nBanking institutions are reliant on IVR systems for [[customer engagement]] and to extend business hours to a [[24/7]] operation. [[Telephone banking]] allows customers to check balances and transaction histories as well as to make payments and transfers. As online channels have emerged, banking customer satisfaction has decreased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itproportal.com/2016/05/10/interactive-voice-response-ivr-the-missing-link/|title=Interactive Voice Response (IVR): The missing link|publisher=IT Pro Portal|author=Comes, Sherry}}</ref>\n\n=== Medical ===\nIVR systems are used by pharmaceutical companies and [[contract research organization]]s to conduct [[clinical trial]]s and manage the large volumes of data generated. The caller will respond to questions in their preferred language and their responses will be logged into a database and possibly recorded at the same time to confirm authenticity. Applications include patient randomization and drug supply management. They are also used in recording patient diaries and questionnaires.<ref name=\"Lam2009\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lam MY, Lee H, Bright R, Korzenik JR, Sands BE |title=Validation of interactive voice response system administration of the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire |journal=Inflamm.

Hospitals and clinics have used IVR systems to allow callers to receive anonymous access to test results. This is information that could easily be handled by a person but the IVR system is used to preserve privacy and avoid potential embarrassment of sensitive information or test results. Users are given a passcode to access their results.\n\n=== Surveying ===\nSome of the largest installed IVR platforms are used for televoting on television game shows, such as ''[[Pop Idol]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', which can generate enormous call spikes. The network provider will often deploy ''[[call gapping]]'' in the [[PSTN]] to prevent network overload. IVR may also be used by survey organizations to ask more sensitive questions where the investigators are concerned that a respondent might feel less comfortable providing these answers to a human interlocutor (such as questions about drug use or sexual behavior). In some cases, an IVR system can be used in the same survey in conjunction with a human interviewer.\n\n==Social Impact ==\nBy allowing\u00a0low-literacy populations to interact with technology, IVR systems form an avenue to build technological skills in developing countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/unesco-pearson_draft_guidelines_for_digital_inclusion.pdf|title=Unesco Guidelines for Digital Inclusion|publisher=Unesco}}</ref> Developing countries have a prevalence of mobile phones even in rural areas which make provide room for IVR technology to support social good projects.

Although television and radio have made it easy to spread information in remote areas, farmers need community support to transform these messages into actionable advice. One of the early research projects in ICTD\u00a0 and IVR was Avaaj Otalo.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Neil|last2=Chittamuru|first2=Deepti|last3=Jain|first3=Anupam|last4=Dave|first4=Paresh|last5=Parikh|first5=Tapan S.|date=2010|title=Avaaj Otalo: A Field Study of an Interactive Voice Forum for Small Farmers in Rural India|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '10|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=733\u2013742|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753434|isbn=9781605589299}}</ref> This project was stemmed out of a \u00a0research project in 2009. In Avaaj Otalo, farmers could avail information by dialing a phone number and navigating through simple audio prompts, they also had the liberty to record questions their peers or local NGO staff.

In public sector, there is a scheme called [[Directly observed treatment, short-course|DOTS]] (Directly Observed Therapy Short Course<ref>{{Citation|title=Directly observed treatment, short-course|date=2018-11-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Directly_observed_treatment,_short-course&oldid=867126871|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>) which was the most effective source for poor population. However, this method requires the patient to commute to the clinic everyday which adds financial and time constraints to the patient.\n\n99DOTS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.99dots.org/|title=99DOTS|website=www.99dots.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> is a project that uses good ICTD principles<ref name=\":0\" /> to use IVR technology to benefit TB patients. Patients have a customized packet of tablets that they receive from the healthcare official who trains them to take the medicine in the sequence daily. Opening the packet in a sequence reveals a phone number that the patient needs to dial to acknowledge that they have taken the medicine. This research project was based out of Microsoft Research India by Bill Theis and who received MacArthur Fellowship for the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/973/|title=Bill Thies - MacArthur Foundation|website=www.macfound.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> The project has spun off as Everwell Technologies<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everwell.org/|title=Everwell|website=www.everwell.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> which now works closely with the Government of India to scale this technology to patients throughout India.\n\n=== Community-based entertainment ===\nAlthough Radio is a very popular means of entertainment, IVR provides interactivity which can help engage in novel ways using their phones.

The system was moderated by editors who listened to these messages and later transcribed these messages onto a blog.\n\n== Developments ==\n=== Video ===\nThe introduction of [[Session initiation protocol|Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) means that point-to-point communications are no longer restricted to voice calls but can now be extended to multimedia technologies such as [[video]]. IVR manufacturers have extended their systems into IVVR (interactive voice and video response), especially for the mobile phone networks. The use of video gives IVR systems the ability to implement [[multimodal interaction]] with the caller.\n\nThe introduction of [[full-duplex]] video IVR in the future will allow systems the ability to read emotions and facial expressions. It may also be used to identify the caller, using technology such as [[Iris scan]] or other [[biometric]] means. Recordings of the caller may be stored to monitor certain transactions and can be used to reduce identity fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nojitter.com/post/240171759/goodbye-ivr-hello-ivisuali-ivr|title=Goodbye IVR... Hello Visual IVR|publisher=No Jitter}}</ref>\n\n=== SIP contact center ===\nWith the introduction of SIP contact centers, call control in a SIP contact center can be implemented by [[CCXML]] scripting, which is an adjunct to the [[VXML]] language used to generate modern IVR dialogues. As calls are queued in the SIP contact center, the IVR system can provide treatment or automation, wait for a fixed period, or play music. Inbound calls to a SIP contact center must be queued or terminated against a SIP end point; SIP IVR systems can be used to replace agents directly by the use of applications deployed using BBUA (back-to-back user agents).\n\n=== Interactive messaging response (IMR) ===\nDue to the introduction of [[instant messaging]] (IM) in contact centers, agents can handle up to 6 different IM conversations at the same time, which increases agent productivity.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} IVR technology is being used to automate IM conversations using existing [[natural language processing]] software. This differs from email handling as email automated response is based on key word spotting and IM conversations are conversational. The use of text messaging abbreviations and smilies requires different grammars to those currently used for speech recognition. IM is also starting to replace text messaging on multimedia mobile handsets.\n\n=== Hosted vs. on-premises IVR ===\nWith the introduction of [[web services]] into the contact center, host integration has been simplified, allowing IVR applications to be hosted remotely from the contact center. This has meant hosted IVR applications using speech are now available to smaller contact centers across the globe and has led to an expansion of ASP (application service providers).\n\nIVR applications can also be hosted on the public network, without contact center integration. Services include public announcement messages and message services for small business. It is also possible to deploy two-prong IVR services where the initial IVR application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center. This can be used to balance loading across multiple contact centers or provide business continuity in the event of a system outage.\n\n==Criticism==\nIVR has historically received criticism for its difficulty of use and a lack of appreciation of the caller's needs as well as objections to providing a voice response to an automated system. However, modern IVR systems are able to include caller context and provide personalized options. Companies have also been criticized for using IVR to reduce operational costs as the solution replaces the need for human agents to address voice inquiries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/chat-bots-are-cool-but-will-they-replace-humans/|title=Chat Bots Are Cool, But Will They Replace Humans?|publisher=CMS Wire}}</ref>  Additionally, as basic information is now available online, the calls coming into a call center are more likely to be complex problems and not ones that can be resolved in an automated fashion, thus requiring the attention of a live agent.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Automated attendant]]\n*[[Automatic call distributor]]\n*[[Automatic number identification]]\n*[[Call avoidance]]\n*[[Call Whisper|Call whisper]]\n*[[Dialog system]]\n*[[DNIS]]\n*[[Dual-tone multi-frequency]] (DTMF)\n*[[Electronic patient-reported outcome]]\n*[[Natural language]]\n*[[Speech recognition]]\n*[[Speech synthesis]]\n*[[Voice portal]]\n*[[The Voder]]\n*[[Voice-based marketing automation]]\n*[[Voice User Interface]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- ATTENTION!

The term '''voice response unit''' ('''VRU''') is sometimes used as well.<ref>{{cite book | isbn=9780471216667 | title=Implementing Voice Over IP | first=Bhumip | last=Khasnabish | location=Lexington, Massachusetts, USA | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nmbexusn9q4C&pg=PA203&dq=vru+ivr&cd=9#v=onepage&q=vru%20ivr&f=false | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.| page=203 | accessdate=21 March 2012 | date=2003-05-30}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nDespite the increase in IVR technology during the 1970s, the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers.<ref>{{Cite news|title=History of a business revolution at the end of a phone|publisher=Scotland On Sunday|author=Harrington, Anthony}}</ref> The first commercial application of IVR was an order entry inventory control system designed and developed by Steven Schmidt in 1973. Early voice response systems were DSP technology based and limited to small vocabularies. In the early 1980s, Leon Ferber's Perception Technology became the first mainstream market competitor, after hard drive technology (read/write random-access to digitized voice data) had reached a cost-effective price point.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} At that time, a system could store digitized speech on disk, play the appropriate spoken message, and process the human's DTMF response.\n\nAs call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s, companies started to invest in [[computer telephony integration]] (CTI) with IVR systems. IVR became vital for call centers deploying universal queuing and routing solutions and acted as an agent which collected customer data to enable intelligent routing decisions. With improvements in technology, systems could use speaker-independent voice recognition of a limited vocabulary instead of requiring the person to use DTMF signaling.\n\nStarting in the 2000s, voice response became more common and cheaper to deploy. This was due to increased [[Central processing unit|CPU]] power and the migration of speech applications from proprietary code to the [[VoiceXML|VXML]] standard.\n\n== Technology ==\n[[DTMF]] decoding and [[VOICE recognition]] are used to interpret the caller's response to voice prompts. DTMF tones are entered via the [[telephone keypad]].\n\nOther technologies include using [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] (TTS) to speak complex and dynamic information, such as e-mails, news reports or weather information. IVR technology is also being introduced into automobile systems for hands-free operation. TTS is computer generated synthesized speech that is no longer the robotic voice traditionally associated with computers. Real voices create the speech in fragments that are spliced together (concatenated) and smoothed before being played to the caller.\n\nAn IVR can be deployed in several ways:\n\n# Equipment installed on the customer premises\n# Equipment installed in the PSTN (public switched telephone network)\n# [[Application service provider]] (ASP) / hosted IVR\n\nAn [[automatic call distributor]] (ACD) is often the first point of contact when calling many larger businesses. An ACD uses digital storage devices to play greetings or announcements, but typically routes a caller without prompting for input. An IVR can play announcements and request an input from the caller. This information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set. (A skill set is a function applied to a group of call-center agents with a particular skill.)\n\nInteractive voice response can be used to front-end a [[call center]] operation by identifying the needs of the caller. Information can be obtained from the caller such as an account number. Answers to simple questions such as account balances or pre-recorded information can be provided without operator intervention. Account numbers from the IVR are often compared to [[caller ID]] data for security reasons and additional IVR responses are required if the caller ID does not match the account record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/interactive-voice-response.htm|title=How Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Works|publisher=How Stuff Works|author=Dave Roos}}</ref>\n\nIVR call flows are created in a variety of ways. A traditional IVR depended upon proprietary programming or scripting languages, whereas modern IVR applications are generated in a similar way to [[World Wide Web|Web]] pages, using standards such as [[VoiceXML]],<ref name=\"VXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml21 | title = Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) Version 2.1 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> [[CCXML]],<ref name=\"CCXML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/ccxml | title = Voice Browser Call Control: CCXML Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C }}</ref> [[SRGS]]<ref name=\"SRGS\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar | title = Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> and [[Speech Synthesis Markup Language|SSML]].<ref name=\"SSML\">{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis | title = Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0 | publisher = W3C}}</ref> The ability to use XML-driven applications allows a [[web server]] to act as the [[application server]], freeing the IVR developer to focus on the call flow.\n\nIVR speech recognition interactions (call flows) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input: directed, open-ended, and mixed dialogue.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\">{{cite book\n | last = Suendermann\n | first = David\n | title = Advances in Commercial Deployment of Spoken Dialog Systems\n | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]]\n | location = Berlin\n | date = 2011\n | pages = 9\u201311\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\">{{cite book\n | last = Perez-Marin\n | first = Diana\n | title = Conversational Agents and Natural Language Interaction: Techniques and Effective Practices\n | publisher = IGI Global\n | location = Hershey, Pennsylvania\n | date = 2011\n | page = 340\n | isbn = 9781441996107}}</ref><ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\">{{cite web\n | title = Presentation of Information - Aurally\n | publisher = W3C\n | url = https://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml/#s6.5\n | access-date = 26 October 2016\n }}</ref>\n\nA directed dialogue prompt communicates a set of valid responses to the user (e.g. \"How can I help you? ... Say something like, ''account balance, order status,'' or ''more options''\"). An open-ended prompt does not communicate a set of valid responses (e.g. \"How can I help you?\"). In both cases, the goal is to glean a valid spoken response from the user. The key difference is that with directed dialogue, the user is more likely to speak an option exactly as was communicated by the prompt (e.g. \"account balance\"). With an open-ended prompt, however, the user is likely to include extraneous words or phrases (e.g. \"I was just looking at my bill and saw that my balance was wrong.\"). The open-ended prompt requires a greater degree of [[natural language processing]] to extract the relevant information from the phrase (i.e. \"balance\"). Open-ended recognition also requires a larger [[grammar]] set, which accounts for a wider array of permutations of a given response (e.g. \"balance was wrong\", \"wrong balance\", \"balance is high\", \"high balance\"). Despite the greater amount of data and processing required for open-ended prompts, they are more interactively efficient, as the prompts themselves are typically much shorter.<ref name=\"advances in commercial deployment\"/>\n\nA mixed dialogue approach involves shifting from open-ended to directed dialogue or vice versa within the same interaction, as one type of prompt may be more effective in a given situation. Mixed dialog prompts must also be able to recognize responses that are not relevant to the immediate prompt, for instance in the case of a user deciding to shift to a function different from the current one.<ref name=\"w3c aural presentation\"/><ref name=\"advances in commercial conversational agents\"/>\n\nHigher level IVR development tools are available to further simplify the application development process. A call flow diagram can be drawn with a GUI tool and the presentation layer (typically VoiceXML) can be automatically generated. In addition, these tools normally provide extension mechanisms for software integration, such as an HTTP interface to a website and a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] interface for connecting to a database.\n\nIn [[telecommunications]], an '''audio response unit''' (ARU) is a device that provides synthesized voice responses to DTMF keypresses by processing calls based on (a) the call-originator input, (b) information received from a database, and (c) information in the incoming call, such as the time of day. ARUs increase the number of information calls handled and provide consistent quality in information retrieval.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Usage ==\nIVR systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost. The use of IVR allows callers' queries to be resolved without a live agent. If callers do not find the information they need, the calls may be transferred to a live agent. The approach allows live agents to have more time to deal with complex interactions. When an IVR system answers multiple phone numbers, the use of [[DNIS]] ensures that the correct application and language is executed. A single large IVR system can handle calls for thousands of applications, each with its own phone numbers and script.\n\nCall centers use IVR systems to identify and segment callers. The ability to identify customers allows services to be tailored according to the customer profile. The caller can be given the option to wait in the queue, choose an automated service, or request a callback. The system may obtain [[caller line identification]] (CLI) data from the network to help identify or authenticate the caller. Additional caller authentication data could include account number, personal information, password and biometrics (such as voice print). IVR also enables customer prioritization. In a system wherein individual customers may have a different status, the service will automatically prioritize the individual's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue.\n\nIVRs will also log call detail information into its own database for auditing, performance report, and future IVR system enhancements. [[Computer telephony integration|CTI]] allows a contact center or organization to gather information about the caller as a means of directing the inquiry to the appropriate agent. CTI can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the IVR dialog from the IVR to the agent desktop using a [[Screen pop|screen-pop]], making for a more effective and efficient service. Voice-activated dialing (VAD) IVR systems are used to automate routine inquiries to a switchboard or [[PABX]] (Private Automatic Branch exchange) operators, and are used in many hospitals and large businesses to reduce the caller waiting time. An additional function is the ability to allow external callers to page staff and transfer the inbound call to the paged person. IVR can be used to provide a more sophisticated [[voice mail]] experience to the caller.\n\n===Banking===\nBanking institutions are reliant on IVR systems for [[customer engagement]] and to extend business hours to a [[24/7]] operation. [[Telephone banking]] allows customers to check balances and transaction histories as well as to make payments and transfers. As online channels have emerged, banking customer satisfaction has decreased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itproportal.com/2016/05/10/interactive-voice-response-ivr-the-missing-link/|title=Interactive Voice Response (IVR): The missing link|publisher=IT Pro Portal|author=Comes, Sherry}}</ref>\n\n=== Medical ===\nIVR systems are used by pharmaceutical companies and [[contract research organization]]s to conduct [[clinical trial]]s and manage the large volumes of data generated. The caller will respond to questions in their preferred language and their responses will be logged into a database and possibly recorded at the same time to confirm authenticity. Applications include patient randomization and drug supply management. They are also used in recording patient diaries and questionnaires.<ref name=\"Lam2009\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lam MY, Lee H, Bright R, Korzenik JR, Sands BE |title=Validation of interactive voice response system administration of the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire |journal=Inflamm.

Hospitals and clinics have used IVR systems to allow callers to receive anonymous access to test results. This is information that could easily be handled by a person but the IVR system is used to preserve privacy and avoid potential embarrassment of sensitive information or test results. Users are given a passcode to access their results.\n\n=== Surveying ===\nSome of the largest installed IVR platforms are used for televoting on television game shows, such as ''[[Pop Idol]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', which can generate enormous call spikes. The network provider will often deploy ''[[call gapping]]'' in the [[PSTN]] to prevent network overload. IVR may also be used by survey organizations to ask more sensitive questions where the investigators are concerned that a respondent might feel less comfortable providing these answers to a human interlocutor (such as questions about drug use or sexual behavior). In some cases, an IVR system can be used in the same survey in conjunction with a human interviewer.\n\n==Social Impact ==\nBy allowing\u00a0low-literacy populations to interact with technology, IVR systems form an avenue to build technological skills in developing countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/unesco-pearson_draft_guidelines_for_digital_inclusion.pdf|title=Unesco Guidelines for Digital Inclusion|publisher=Unesco}}</ref> Developing countries have a prevalence of mobile phones even in rural areas which make provide room for IVR technology to support social good projects. However, most IVR technology is designed in resource-rich domains hence research is necessary to contextualize and adapt this technology for developing countries.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|title=Information and communication technologies for development|date=2019-03-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Information_and_communication_technologies_for_development&oldid=885920797|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> Research in ICTD has helped tailor IVR towards social impact has created innovative applications in health, agricultural, entertainment and citizen journalism.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nIn rural India, it is critical for farmers to obtain information early. Although television and radio have made it easy to spread information in remote areas, farmers need community support to transform these messages into actionable advice. One of the early research projects in ICTD\u00a0 and IVR was Avaaj Otalo.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Neil|last2=Chittamuru|first2=Deepti|last3=Jain|first3=Anupam|last4=Dave|first4=Paresh|last5=Parikh|first5=Tapan S.|date=2010|title=Avaaj Otalo: A Field Study of an Interactive Voice Forum for Small Farmers in Rural India|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '10|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=733\u2013742|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753434|isbn=9781605589299}}</ref> This project was stemmed out of a \u00a0research project in 2009. In Avaaj Otalo, farmers could avail information by dialing a phone number and navigating through simple audio prompts, they also had the liberty to record questions their peers or local NGO staff. This research project has hence spun off as a company called Awaaz.de<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://awaaz.de/|title=Awaaz.De {{!}} Mobile Solutions for Social Impact|website=awaaz.de|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> a social enterprise that works with developmental organizations by providing tools for them to work with marginalized users.\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nIn the context of tuberculosis, patients need to adhere to the medicine daily basis for a period of few months to completely heal. In public sector, there is a scheme called [[Directly observed treatment, short-course|DOTS]] (Directly Observed Therapy Short Course<ref>{{Citation|title=Directly observed treatment, short-course|date=2018-11-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Directly_observed_treatment,_short-course&oldid=867126871|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>) which was the most effective source for poor population. However, this method requires the patient to commute to the clinic everyday which adds financial and time constraints to the patient.\n\n99DOTS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.99dots.org/|title=99DOTS|website=www.99dots.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> is a project that uses good ICTD principles<ref name=\":0\" /> to use IVR technology to benefit TB patients. Patients have a customized packet of tablets that they receive from the healthcare official who trains them to take the medicine in the sequence daily. Opening the packet in a sequence reveals a phone number that the patient needs to dial to acknowledge that they have taken the medicine. This research project was based out of Microsoft Research India by Bill Theis and who received MacArthur Fellowship for the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/973/|title=Bill Thies - MacArthur Foundation|website=www.macfound.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> The project has spun off as Everwell Technologies<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everwell.org/|title=Everwell|website=www.everwell.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> which now works closely with the Government of India to scale this technology to patients throughout India.\n\n=== Community-based entertainment ===\nAlthough Radio is a very popular means of entertainment, IVR provides interactivity which can help engage in novel ways using their phones. ICTD research has used IVR entertainment as a mechanism to support communities and provide information to populations that are hard to reach by traditional methods.\n\n* Sangeet Swara:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vashistha|first=Aditya|last2=Cutrell|first2=Edward|last3=Borriello|first3=Gaetano|last4=Thies|first4=William|date=2015|title=Sangeet Swara: A Community-Moderated Voice Forum in Rural India|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=417\u2013426|doi=10.1145/2702123.2702191|isbn=9781450331456}}</ref> voice-based singing platform for low literate users in India.

The system was moderated by editors who listened to these messages and later transcribed these messages onto a blog.\n\n== Developments ==\n=== Video ===\nThe introduction of [[Session initiation protocol|Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) means that point-to-point communications are no longer restricted to voice calls but can now be extended to multimedia technologies such as [[video]]. IVR manufacturers have extended their systems into IVVR (interactive voice and video response), especially for the mobile phone networks. The use of video gives IVR systems the ability to implement [[multimodal interaction]] with the caller.\n\nThe introduction of [[full-duplex]] video IVR in the future will allow systems the ability to read emotions and facial expressions. It may also be used to identify the caller, using technology such as [[Iris scan]] or other [[biometric]] means. Recordings of the caller may be stored to monitor certain transactions and can be used to reduce identity fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nojitter.com/post/240171759/goodbye-ivr-hello-ivisuali-ivr|title=Goodbye IVR... Hello Visual IVR|publisher=No Jitter}}</ref>\n\n=== SIP contact center ===\nWith the introduction of SIP contact centers, call control in a SIP contact center can be implemented by [[CCXML]] scripting, which is an adjunct to the [[VXML]] language used to generate modern IVR dialogues. As calls are queued in the SIP contact center, the IVR system can provide treatment or automation, wait for a fixed period, or play music. Inbound calls to a SIP contact center must be queued or terminated against a SIP end point; SIP IVR systems can be used to replace agents directly by the use of applications deployed using BBUA (back-to-back user agents).\n\n=== Interactive messaging response (IMR) ===\nDue to the introduction of [[instant messaging]] (IM) in contact centers, agents can handle up to 6 different IM conversations at the same time, which increases agent productivity.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} IVR technology is being used to automate IM conversations using existing [[natural language processing]] software. This differs from email handling as email automated response is based on key word spotting and IM conversations are conversational. The use of text messaging abbreviations and smilies requires different grammars to those currently used for speech recognition. IM is also starting to replace text messaging on multimedia mobile handsets.\n\n=== Hosted vs. on-premises IVR ===\nWith the introduction of [[web services]] into the contact center, host integration has been simplified, allowing IVR applications to be hosted remotely from the contact center. This has meant hosted IVR applications using speech are now available to smaller contact centers across the globe and has led to an expansion of ASP (application service providers).\n\nIVR applications can also be hosted on the public network, without contact center integration. Services include public announcement messages and message services for small business. It is also possible to deploy two-prong IVR services where the initial IVR application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center. This can be used to balance loading across multiple contact centers or provide business continuity in the event of a system outage.\n\n==Criticism==\nIVR has historically received criticism for its difficulty of use and a lack of appreciation of the caller's needs as well as objections to providing a voice response to an automated system. However, modern IVR systems are able to include caller context and provide personalized options. Companies have also been criticized for using IVR to reduce operational costs as the solution replaces the need for human agents to address voice inquiries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/chat-bots-are-cool-but-will-they-replace-humans/|title=Chat Bots Are Cool, But Will They Replace Humans?|publisher=CMS Wire}}</ref>  Additionally, as basic information is now available online, the calls coming into a call center are more likely to be complex problems and not ones that can be resolved in an automated fashion, thus requiring the attention of a live agent.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Automated attendant]]\n*[[Automatic call distributor]]\n*[[Automatic number identification]]\n*[[Call avoidance]]\n*[[Call Whisper|Call whisper]]\n*[[Dialog system]]\n*[[DNIS]]\n*[[Dual-tone multi-frequency]] (DTMF)\n*[[Electronic patient-reported outcome]]\n*[[Natural language]]\n*[[Speech recognition]]\n*[[Speech synthesis]]\n*[[Voice portal]]\n*[[The Voder]]\n*[[Voice-based marketing automation]]\n*[[Voice User Interface]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- ATTENTION!

It was first published in [[2006 in literature|2006]]. It won a number of awards, including the [[Man Booker Prize]] for that year, the [[National Book Critics Circle]] Fiction Award in 2007,<ref name=\"national-win\" /> and the 2006 [[Vodafone Crossword Book Award]].\n\nIt was written over a period of seven years after her first book, the critically acclaimed ''[[Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard]].''<ref name=\"booker-win\" /><ref name=\"Jabberwock\" /> Among its main themes are migration, living between two worlds, and between past and present.\n\n== Summary ==\nThe story centers around the lives of Biju and Sai. Biju is an Indian living in the [[United States]] illegally, son of a cook who works for Sai's grandfather. Sai is a girl living in mountainous [[Kalimpong]] with her maternal grandfather, Jemubhai Patel; the cook; and a dog named Mutt. Author Desai alternates the narration between these two points of view.  The action of the novel takes place in 1986.\n\nThe novel follows the journey of Biju, an [[illegal immigration|illegal alien]] in the United States who is trying to make a new life for himself, and contrasts this with the experiences of Sai, an anglicised Indian girl living with her grandfather in India. The novel shows both internal conflicts within India and tensions between the past and present. Desai writes of rejection and yet awe of the English way of life, opportunities to gain money in America, and the squalor of living in India. Through critical portrayal of Sai's grandfather, the retired judge, Desai comments upon leading Indians who were considered too anglicised and forgetful of traditional ways of Indian life.\n\nThe retired judge Jemubhai Patel is a man disgusted by Indian ways and customs -- so much so, that he eats ''[[chapati]]s'' (a moist Asian flatbread) with knife and fork. Patel disdains other Indians, including the father with whom he breaks ties and the wife whom he abandons at his father's home after torturing her.  Yet Patel never is fully accepted by the British, despite his education and adopted mannerisms.\n\nThe major theme running throughout ''The Inheritance of Loss'' is one closely related to [[colonialism]] and the effects of [[post-colonialism]]: the loss of identity and the way it travels through generations as a sense of loss. Some characters snub those who embody the Indian way of life, others are angered by anglicised Indians who have lost their traditions; none is content.\n\nThe [[Gorkhaland]] movement is used as the historic backdrop of the novel.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Natasha Walter]] found it a \"grim\" novel, highlighting \"how individuals are always failing to communicate\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Walter|first1=Natasha|title=Mutt and the maths tutor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/26/featuresreviews.guardianreview17|work=The Guardian|date=26 August 2006}}</ref> ''The Observer'' found some excellent comic set-pieces amid the grimness.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hughes|first1=Sarah|title=Uncle Potty and other guides to the truth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/03/fiction.features1|work=The Observer|date=3 September 2006}}</ref> The ''[[New York Times]]'' claimed Desai \"manages to explore, with intimacy and insight, just about every contemporary international issue: globalization, multiculturalism, economic inequality, fundamentalism and terrorist violence.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Wounded by the West|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/books/review/wounded-by-the-west.html|work=New York Times|date=12 February 2006}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist\n| refs =\n\n<ref name=\"national-win\">\n{{cite press release\n| title = All Past National Book Critics Circle Award Winners and Finalists \u2013 Page 2\n| publisher = Bookcritics.org\n| url = http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/page_2\n| accessdate = 2011-07-06\n}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"booker-win\">\n{{cite press release\n| title = The Inheritance of Loss: Kiran Desai\n| publisher = Booker Prize Foundation\n| url = http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/2\n| accessdate = 2011-07-06\n}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Jabberwock\">\n{{cite web\n| title =  Kiran Desai interview\n| work = Jabberwock (blog)\n| date = 2006-01-20\n| url = http://jaiarjun.blogspot.com/2006/01/kiran-desai-interview_20.html\n| accessdate = 2011-06-14\n}}\n</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/wbc/rss.xml Podcast of Kiran Desai talking about ''The Inheritance of Loss''] on the BBC's ''[[World Book Club]]''\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5413704.stm Review by BBC News]\n* [http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/01/04/luminous_family_saga_bridges_eras_cultures/?page=1 Review by Boston.com]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/books/review/12mishra.html Review by NY Times, includes MP3 of author reading from the book]\n* [[Roy, Pinaki]]. \"''The Inheritance of Loss'': A Brief Rereading\".

Some characters snub those who embody the Indian way of life, others are angered by anglicised Indians who have lost their traditions; none is content.\n\nThe [[Gorkhaland]] movement is used as the historic backdrop of the novel.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Natasha Walter]] found it a \"grim\" novel, highlighting \"how individuals are always failing to communicate\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Walter|first1=Natasha|title=Mutt and the maths tutor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/26/featuresreviews.guardianreview17|work=The Guardian|date=26 August 2006}}</ref> ''The Observer'' found some excellent comic set-pieces amid the grimness.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hughes|first1=Sarah|title=Uncle Potty and other guides to the truth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/03/fiction.features1|work=The Observer|date=3 September 2006}}</ref> The ''[[New York Times]]'' claimed Desai \"manages to explore, with intimacy and insight, just about every contemporary international issue: globalization, multiculturalism, economic inequality, fundamentalism and terrorist violence.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Wounded by the West|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/books/review/wounded-by-the-west.html|work=New York Times|date=12 February 2006}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist\n| refs =\n\n<ref name=\"national-win\">\n{{cite press release\n| title = All Past National Book Critics Circle Award Winners and Finalists \u2013 Page 2\n| publisher = Bookcritics.org\n| url = http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/page_2\n| accessdate = 2011-07-06\n}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"booker-win\">\n{{cite press release\n| title = The Inheritance of Loss: Kiran Desai\n| publisher = Booker Prize Foundation\n| url = http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/2\n| accessdate = 2011-07-06\n}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Jabberwock\">\n{{cite web\n| title =  Kiran Desai interview\n| work = Jabberwock (blog)\n| date = 2006-01-20\n| url = http://jaiarjun.blogspot.com/2006/01/kiran-desai-interview_20.html\n| accessdate = 2011-06-14\n}}\n</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/wbc/rss.xml Podcast of Kiran Desai talking about ''The Inheritance of Loss''] on the BBC's ''[[World Book Club]]''\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5413704.stm Review by BBC News]\n* [http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/01/04/luminous_family_saga_bridges_eras_cultures/?page=1 Review by Boston.com]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/books/review/12mishra.html Review by NY Times, includes MP3 of author reading from the book]\n* [[Roy, Pinaki]]. \"''The Inheritance of Loss'': A Brief Rereading\".

In each playout, the game is played out to the very end by selecting moves at random. The final game result of each playout is then used to weight the nodes in the game tree so that better nodes are more likely to be chosen in future playouts.\n\nThe most basic way to use playouts is to apply the same number of playouts after each legal move of the current player, then choose the move which led to the most victories.<ref name=\"Bruegmann\">{{cite book|last=Br\u00fcgmann|first=Bernd|title=Monte Carlo Go|url=http://www.ideanest.com/vegos/MonteCarloGo.pdf|publisher=Technical report, Department of Physics, Syracuse University|year=1993}}</ref> The efficiency of this method\u2014called ''Pure Monte Carlo Game Search''\u2014often increases with time as more playouts are assigned to the moves that have frequently resulted in the current player's victory according to previous playouts. Each round of Monte Carlo tree search consists of four steps:<ref name=\"chaslot2008\">{{cite journal|author1=G.M.J.B. Chaslot |author2=M.H.M. Winands |author3=J.W.H.M.

The root is the current game state and a leaf is any node from which no simulation (playout) has yet been initiated. The section below says more about a way of biasing choice of child nodes that lets the game tree expand towards the most promising moves, which is the essence of Monte Carlo tree search.\n* ''Expansion'': Unless {{math|''L''}} ends the game decisively (e.g. win/loss/draw) for either player, create one (or more) child nodes and choose node {{math|''C''}} from one of them. Child nodes are any valid moves from the game position defined by {{math|''L''}}.\n* ''Simulation'': Complete one random playout from node {{math|''C''}}. This step is sometimes also called playout or rollout. A playout may be as simple as choosing [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniform random]] moves until the game is decided (for example in chess, the game is won, lost, or drawn).\n* ''Backpropagation'': Use the result of the playout to update information in the nodes on the path from {{math|''C''}} to {{math|''R''}}.\n\n[[File:MCTS-steps.svg|800px|thumb|center|Step of Monte Carlo tree search.]]\n\nThis graph shows the steps involved in one decision, with each node showing the ratio of wins to total playouts from that point in the game tree for the player that node represents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jeffbradberry.com/posts/2015/09/intro-to-monte-carlo-tree-search/|title=Introduction to Monte Carlo Tree Search|last=Bradberry|first=Jeff|date=2015-09-07|website=|access-date=}}</ref> In the Selection diagram, black is about to move. The root node shows there are 11 wins out of 21 playouts for white from this position so far. It complements the total of 10/21 black wins shown along the three black nodes under it, each of which represents a possible black move.\n\nIf white loses the simulation, all nodes along the selection incremented their simulation count (the denominator), but among them only the black nodes were credited with wins (the numerator). If instead white wins, all nodes along the selection would still increment their simulation count, but among them only the white nodes would be credited with wins. In games where draws are possible, a draw causes the numerator for both black and white to be incremented by 0.5 and the denominator by 1. This ensures that during selection, each player's choices expand towards the most promising moves for that player, which mirrors the goal of each player to maximize the value of their move.\n\nRounds of search are repeated as long as the time allotted to a move remains. Then the move with the most simulations made (i.e. the highest denominator) is chosen as the final answer.\n\n== Pure Monte Carlo game search ==\nThis basic procedure can be applied to any game whose positions necessarily have a finite number of moves and finite length. For each position, all feasible moves are determined: ''k'' random games are played out to the very end, and the scores are recorded. The move leading to the best score is chosen.

However Monte Carlo tree search does offer significant advantages over [[alpha\u2013beta pruning]] and similar algorithms that minimize the search space.\n\nIn particular, pure Monte Carlo tree search does not need an explicit [[evaluation function]]. Simply implementing the game's mechanics is sufficient to explore the search space (i.e. the generating of allowed moves in a given position and the game-end conditions). As such, Monte Carlo tree search can be employed in games without a developed theory or in [[general game playing]].\n\nThe game tree in Monte Carlo tree search grows asymmetrically as the method concentrates on the more promising subtrees. Thus{{dubious|date=June 2019}} it achieves better results than classical algorithms in games with a high [[branching factor]].\n\nMoreover, Monte Carlo tree search can be interrupted at [[Anytime algorithm|any time]] yielding the most promising move already found.\n\nA disadvantage is that, in a critical position against an expert player, there may be a single branch which leads to a loss. Because this is not easily found at random, the search may not \"see\" it and will not take it into account. It is believed that this may have been part of the reason for [[AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol|AlphaGo's loss in its fourth game against Lee Sedol]]. In essence, the search attempts to prune sequences which are less relevant. In some cases, a play can lead to a very specific line of play which is significant, but which is overlooked when the tree is pruned, and this outcome is therefore \"off the search radar\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gogameguru.com/lee-sedol-defeats-alphago-masterful-comeback-game-4/|title=Lee Sedol defeats AlphaGo in masterful comeback - Game 4|publisher=Go Game Guru|access-date=2017-07-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116082508/https://gogameguru.com/lee-sedol-defeats-alphago-masterful-comeback-game-4/|archive-date=2016-11-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Improvements ==\nVarious modifications of the basic Monte Carlo tree search method have been proposed to shorten the search time. Some employ domain-specific expert knowledge, others do not.\n\nMonte Carlo tree search can use either ''light'' or ''heavy'' playouts.

One such method assigns nonzero ''priors'' to the number of won and played simulations when creating each child node, leading to artificially raised or lowered average win rates that cause the node to be chosen more or less frequently, respectively, in the selection step.<ref name=\"Gelly-Silver\">{{cite book|author1=Sylvain Gelly |author2=David Silver |chapter=Combining Online and Offline Knowledge in UCT|pages=273\u2013280|others=Zoubin Ghahramani (ed.)|title=Machine Learning, Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth International Conference (ICML 2007), Corvallis, Oregon, USA, June 20\u201324, 2007|publisher=ACM|year=2007|isbn=978-1-59593-793-3|chapter-url=http://www.machinelearning.org/proceedings/icml2007/papers/387.pdf}}</ref> A related method, called ''progressive bias'', consists in adding to the UCB1 formula a <math>\\frac{b_i}{n_i}</math> element, where {{math|''b''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a heuristic score of the  {{math|''i''}}-th move.<ref name=\"chaslot2008\"/>\n\nThe basic Monte Carlo tree search collects enough information to find the most promising moves only after many rounds; until then its moves are essentially random. This exploratory phase may be reduced significantly in a certain class of games using RAVE (''Rapid Action Value Estimation'').<ref name=\"Gelly-Silver\"/> In these games, permutations of a sequence of moves lead to the same position. Typically, they are board games in which a move involves placement of a piece or a stone on the board. In such games the value of each move is often only slightly influenced by other moves.\n\nIn RAVE, for a given game tree node {{math|''N''}}, its child nodes {{math|''C''<sub>''i''</sub>}} store not only the statistics of wins in playouts started in node {{math|''N''}} but also the statistics of wins in all playouts started in node {{math|''N''}} and below it, if they contain move {{math|''i''}} (also when the move was played in the tree, between node {{math|''N''}} and a playout). This way the contents of tree nodes are influenced not only by moves played immediately in a given position but also by the same moves played later.\n\n[[File:Tic-tac-toe-RAVE-English.svg|frame|center|RAVE on the example of tic-tac-toe.

In each playout, the game is played out to the very end by selecting moves at random. The final game result of each playout is then used to weight the nodes in the game tree so that better nodes are more likely to be chosen in future playouts.\n\nThe most basic way to use playouts is to apply the same number of playouts after each legal move of the current player, then choose the move which led to the most victories.<ref name=\"Bruegmann\">{{cite book|last=Br\u00fcgmann|first=Bernd|title=Monte Carlo Go|url=http://www.ideanest.com/vegos/MonteCarloGo.pdf|publisher=Technical report, Department of Physics, Syracuse University|year=1993}}</ref> The efficiency of this method\u2014called ''Pure Monte Carlo Game Search''\u2014often increases with time as more playouts are assigned to the moves that have frequently resulted in the current player's victory according to previous playouts. Each round of Monte Carlo tree search consists of four steps:<ref name=\"chaslot2008\">{{cite journal|author1=G.M.J.B. Chaslot |author2=M.H.M. Winands |author3=J.W.H.M.

The root is the current game state and a leaf is any node from which no simulation (playout) has yet been initiated. The section below says more about a way of biasing choice of child nodes that lets the game tree expand towards the most promising moves, which is the essence of Monte Carlo tree search.\n* ''Expansion'': Unless {{math|''L''}} ends the game decisively (e.g. win/loss/draw) for either player, create one (or more) child nodes and choose node {{math|''C''}} from one of them. Child nodes are any valid moves from the game position defined by {{math|''L''}}.\n* ''Simulation'': Complete one random playout from node {{math|''C''}}. This step is sometimes also called playout or rollout. A playout may be as simple as choosing [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniform random]] moves until the game is decided (for example in chess, the game is won, lost, or drawn).\n* ''Backpropagation'': Use the result of the playout to update information in the nodes on the path from {{math|''C''}} to {{math|''R''}}.\n\n[[File:MCTS-steps.svg|1200px|thumb|center|Step of Monte Carlo tree search.]]\n\nThis graph shows the steps involved in one decision, with each node showing the ratio of wins to total playouts from that point in the game tree for the player that node represents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jeffbradberry.com/posts/2015/09/intro-to-monte-carlo-tree-search/|title=Introduction to Monte Carlo Tree Search|last=Bradberry|first=Jeff|date=2015-09-07|website=|access-date=}}</ref> In the Selection diagram, black is about to move. The root node shows there are 11 wins out of 21 playouts for white from this position so far. It complements the total of 10/21 black wins shown along the three black nodes under it, each of which represents a possible black move.\n\nIf white loses the simulation, all nodes along the selection incremented their simulation count (the denominator), but among them only the black nodes were credited with wins (the numerator). If instead white wins, all nodes along the selection would still increment their simulation count, but among them only the white nodes would be credited with wins. In games where draws are possible, a draw causes the numerator for both black and white to be incremented by 0.5 and the denominator by 1. This ensures that during selection, each player's choices expand towards the most promising moves for that player, which mirrors the goal of each player to maximize the value of their move.\n\nRounds of search are repeated as long as the time allotted to a move remains. Then the move with the most simulations made (i.e. the highest denominator) is chosen as the final answer.\n\n== Pure Monte Carlo game search ==\nThis basic procedure can be applied to any game whose positions necessarily have a finite number of moves and finite length. For each position, all feasible moves are determined: ''k'' random games are played out to the very end, and the scores are recorded. The move leading to the best score is chosen. Ties are broken by fair coin flips. Pure Monte Carlo Game Search results in strong play in several games with random elements, as in the game ''[[EinStein w\u00fcrfelt nicht!]]''. It converges to optimal play (as ''k'' tends to infinity) in board filling games with random turn order, for instance in [[Hex (board game)|Hex]] with random turn order.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last1=Peres |first1= Yuval| last2=Schramm| first2=Oded| last3= Sheffield| first3 =Scott | last4 = Wilson | first4=David B. |eprint=math/0508580 |title=Random-Turn Hex and other selection games |date=2006 }}</ref> DeepMind's AlphaZero replaces the simulation step with an evaluation based on a neural network.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Exploration and exploitation ==\nThe main difficulty in selecting child nodes is maintaining some balance between the ''exploitation'' of deep variants after moves with high average win rate and the ''exploration'' of moves with few simulations.

However Monte Carlo tree search does offer significant advantages over [[alpha\u2013beta pruning]] and similar algorithms that minimize the search space.\n\nIn particular, pure Monte Carlo tree search does not need an explicit [[evaluation function]]. Simply implementing the game's mechanics is sufficient to explore the search space (i.e. the generating of allowed moves in a given position and the game-end conditions). As such, Monte Carlo tree search can be employed in games without a developed theory or in [[general game playing]].\n\nThe game tree in Monte Carlo tree search grows asymmetrically as the method concentrates on the more promising subtrees. Thus{{dubious|date=June 2019}} it achieves better results than classical algorithms in games with a high [[branching factor]].\n\nMoreover, Monte Carlo tree search can be interrupted at [[Anytime algorithm|any time]] yielding the most promising move already found.\n\nA disadvantage is that, in a critical position against an expert player, there may be a single branch which leads to a loss. Because this is not easily found at random, the search may not \"see\" it and will not take it into account. It is believed that this may have been part of the reason for [[AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol|AlphaGo's loss in its fourth game against Lee Sedol]]. In essence, the search attempts to prune sequences which are less relevant. In some cases, a play can lead to a very specific line of play which is significant, but which is overlooked when the tree is pruned, and this outcome is therefore \"off the search radar\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gogameguru.com/lee-sedol-defeats-alphago-masterful-comeback-game-4/|title=Lee Sedol defeats AlphaGo in masterful comeback - Game 4|publisher=Go Game Guru|access-date=2017-07-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116082508/https://gogameguru.com/lee-sedol-defeats-alphago-masterful-comeback-game-4/|archive-date=2016-11-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Improvements ==\nVarious modifications of the basic Monte Carlo tree search method have been proposed to shorten the search time. Some employ domain-specific expert knowledge, others do not.\n\nMonte Carlo tree search can use either ''light'' or ''heavy'' playouts. Light playouts consist of random moves while heavy playouts apply various heuristics to influence the choice of moves.<ref>\u015awiechowski, M.; Ma\u0144dziuk, J., \"Self-Adaptation of Playing Strategies in General Game Playing\" (2010), ''IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games'', vol: 6(4), pp. 367-381, doi: 10.1109/TCIAIG.2013.2275163, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6571225&isnumber=4804729</ref> These heuristics may employ the results of previous playouts (e.g. the Last Good Reply heuristic<ref>{{cite journal|last=Drake|first=Peter|title=The Last-Good-Reply Policy for Monte-Carlo Go|journal=ICGA Journal|volume=32|issue=4|pages=221\u2013227|date=December 2009|doi=10.3233/ICG-2009-32404}}</ref>) or expert knowledge of a given game.

This exploratory phase may be reduced significantly in a certain class of games using RAVE (''Rapid Action Value Estimation'').<ref name=\"Gelly-Silver\"/> In these games, permutations of a sequence of moves lead to the same position. Typically, they are board games in which a move involves placement of a piece or a stone on the board. In such games the value of each move is often only slightly influenced by other moves.\n\nIn RAVE, for a given game tree node {{math|''N''}}, its child nodes {{math|''C''<sub>''i''</sub>}} store not only the statistics of wins in playouts started in node {{math|''N''}} but also the statistics of wins in all playouts started in node {{math|''N''}} and below it, if they contain move {{math|''i''}} (also when the move was played in the tree, between node {{math|''N''}} and a playout). This way the contents of tree nodes are influenced not only by moves played immediately in a given position but also by the same moves played later.\n\n[[File:Tic-tac-toe-RAVE-English.svg|frame|center|RAVE on the example of tic-tac-toe.
