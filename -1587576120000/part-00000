One example is the French [[Cedex (France)|CEDEX]] system.\n\n== Terms ==\nThere are a number of synonyms for postal code; some are country-specific.\n* '''[[Codice di Avviamento Postale|CAP]]''': The standard term in Italy; CAP is an acronym for ''codice di avviamento postale'' (postal expedition code).\n* '''[[C\u00f3digo de Endere\u00e7amento Postal|CEP]]''': The standard term in Brazil; CEP is an acronym for ''c\u00f3digo de endere\u00e7amento postal'' (postal addressing code).\n* '''[[Eircode]]''': The standard term in Ireland.\n* '''[[Postal codes in Switzerland and Liechtenstein|NPA]]''' in [[Romandy|French-speaking Switzerland]] (''num\u00e9ro postal d'acheminement'') and [[Ticino|Italian-speaking Switzerland]] (''numero postale di avviamento'').\n* '''[[Postal Index Number|PIN]]''': The standard term in India; PIN is an acronym for Postal Index Number. Sometimes [[RAS syndrome|redundantly]] called a PIN code.\n* '''PLZ''': The standard term in Germany, Austria, [[German-speaking Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]]; PLZ is an abbreviation of ''Postleitzahl'' (postal routing number).\n* '''Postal code''': The general term is used in Canada.\n* '''Postcode''': This [[compound (linguistics)|solid compound]] is popular in many English-speaking countries and is also the standard term in the Netherlands.\n*'''[[:cs:Po\u0161tovn\u00ed sm\u011brovac\u00ed \u010d\u00edslo|PS\u010c]]''': The standard term in Slovakia and Czech Republic; PS\u010c is an acronym for ''Po\u0161tov\u00e9 smerovacie \u010d\u00edslo'' (in Slovak) or ''Po\u0161tovn\u00ed sm\u011brovac\u00ed \u010d\u00edslo'' (in Czech), both meaning postal routing number.\n* '''[[ZIP code]]''': The standard term in the United States and the Philippines; ZIP is an [[acronym]] for Zone Improvement Plan.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Stamp Soviet Union 1977 CPA 4775.jpg|thumb|1977 Soviet stamp promoting the use of postal codes]]\nThe development of postal codes reflects the increasing complexity of postal delivery as populations grew and the [[built environment]] became more complex. This happened first in large cities. Postal codes began with postal district numbers (or postal zone numbers) within large cities. [[London]] was first subdivided into 10 districts in 1857, and [[Liverpool]] in 1864. By [[World War I]], such postal district or zone numbers existed in various large European cities. They existed in the United States at least as early as the 1920s, possibly implemented at the local post office level only (for example, instances of \"Boston 9, Mass\" in 1920 are attested,<ref name=\"1920_advert_Lynd_Farquhar_Co\">{{Cite journal |author=Lynd-Farquhar Co |title=Advertisement for machine tools, 1920 |journal=American Machinist |page=388 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezRMAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA388|postscript=. |year=1920}}</ref><ref name=\"1920_advert_Hill_Clarke_Co\">{{Cite journal |author1=Hill, Clarke  |author2=Co, Inc  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Advertisement for a drill press, 1920 |journal=American Machinist |page=389 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezRMAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA389|postscript=. |year=1920}}</ref>) although they were evidently not used throughout all major US cities (implemented [[United States Post Office Department|USPOD]]-wide) until [[World War II]].\n\nBy 1930 or earlier the idea of extending postal district or zone numbering plans beyond large cities to cover even small towns and rural locales was in the air. These developed into postal codes as they are defined today. The name of US postal codes, \"ZIP codes\", reflects this evolutionary growth from a zone plan to a zone improvement plan, \"ZIP\". Modern postal codes were first introduced in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] in December 1932,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upns.org/article/85-first-postal-zip-code |title=The First Postal (ZIP) Code in the World |publisher=Ukrainian Philatelic and Numismatic Society |date=2009-04-20 |accessdate=2010-03-04 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423155849/http://www.upns.org/article/85-first-postal-zip-code |archivedate=2010-04-23 }}</ref> but the system was abandoned in 1939.

Green are country-level databases with open access, red are commercial and non-open.]]\nThe classic postal codes of the 1970s are not fine-grained, can't be used as location (converted to approximated latitude/longitude of the address). But modern digital maps can generate geocodes (e.g. [[Geohash]]), it can be used as a finer location code with the same number of digits, and without administrative cost.\n\nClassical postcodes are administrated by a central authority: this control can be used to obtain profits when data is not opened.{{Clarify|date=July 2019}} By 2016, according to ODI (Open Data Index is an [[Open Knowledge Foundation]]'s project), only 8% of postal codes were opened.{{Clarify|date=July 2019}}\n\n== Presentation ==\n[[File:Postal codes by country.svg|thumb|350px|right|Postal codes by country and digit-type.<br />'''Numeric digits''': <br/> &nbsp; {{legend inline|#87aade|3}} {{legend inline|#5f8dd3|4}} {{legend inline|#3771c8|5}} {{legend inline|#2c5aa0|6}} {{legend inline|#214478|7}} {{legend inline|#162d50|8}} {{legend inline|#0b1728|9}} {{legend inline|#070f1a|10}} <br />'''Alphanumeric digits''': {{legend inline|#2ca02c|6}} {{legend inline|#217821|7}} {{legend inline|#165016|8}}<br />'''Postal codes not in use''': {{legend inline|#e0e0e0|}}]]\n\n=== Character sets ===\nThe characters used in postal codes are\n* The [[Arabic numerals]] \"0\" to \"9\"\n* Letters of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]]\n* Spaces, hyphens\n\n==== Reserved characters ====\n[[Postal codes in the Netherlands]] originally did not use the letters 'F', 'I', 'O', 'Q', 'U' and 'Y' for technical reasons. But as almost all existing combinations are now used, these letters were allowed for new locations starting 2005. The letter combinations \"SS\" ([[Schutzstaffel]]), \"SD\"([[Sicherheitsdienst]]), and \"SA\" ([[Sturmabteilung]]) are not used for historical reasons.\n\n[[Postal codes in Canada]] do not include the letters D, F, I, O, Q, or U, as the [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) equipment used in automated sorting could easily confuse them with other letters and digits. The letters W and Z are used, but are not currently used as the first letter. The Canadian Postal Codes use alternate letters and numbers (with a space after the 3rd character) in this format: A9A 9A9<ref name=GreatData.com>{{cite web|title=GreatData.com (a licensee of Canada Post data)|url=http://greatdata.com|accessdate=8 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402154507/http://greatdata.com/|archivedate=2 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Ireland]] the [[eircode]] system uses the following letters only: A, C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, T, V, W, X, Y. This serves two purposes:\n* to avoid confusion in OCR, and\n* it also helps to avoid accidental double-entendres by avoiding the creation of word look-alikes, as Eircode's last four characters are random.\n\n==== Alphanumeric postal codes ====\nMost of the postal code systems are numeric; only a few are alphanumeric (i.e., use both letters and digits). Alphanumeric systems can, given the same number of characters, encode many more locations. For example, while a two digit numeric code can represent 100 locations, a two character alphanumeric code using ten numbers and twenty letters can represent 900 locations.\n\nThe independent nations using alphanumeric postal code systems are:\n* [[Argentina]] ([[Postal codes in Argentina|see table]])\n* [[Brunei]] ([[Postal codes in Brunei|see table]])\n* [[Canada]] ([[Postal codes in Canada|see table]])\n* [[Eswatini]]\n* [[Ireland]] ([[Postal addresses in the Republic of Ireland|see table]])\n* [[Jamaica]] ([[Postal codes in Jamaica|see table]]) (suspended in 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaicapost.gov.jm/corporate_news/pressrelease_07.htm |title=Post Code Project Suspended Indefinitely |work=Press Release 07 published in Daily Gleaner |publisher=Jamaica Post |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2010-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226125027/http://www.jamaicapost.gov.jm/corporate_news/pressrelease_07.htm |archivedate=2010-02-26 }}</ref>)\n* [[Kazakhstan]] (since 2015)\n* [[Malta]] ([[Postal codes in Malta|see table]])\n* [[Netherlands]] ([[Postal codes in the Netherlands|see table]])\n* [[Peru]] ([[List of postal codes in Peru|see table]]) The postal code format in Peru was updated in February 2011 to be of the format of five digits.\n* [[Somalia]]\n* [[United Kingdom]] ([[Postcodes in the United Kingdom|see table]])\n\nCountries which prefix their postal codes with a fixed group of letters, indicating a country code, include [[Andorra]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Barbados]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]].\n\n=== Country code prefixes ===\n[[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country codes were recommended by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] as well as the [[Universal Postal Union]] to be used in conjunction with postal codes starting in 1994,<ref name=\"daCruz_ColumbiaUni\">{{cite web| last =da Cruz| first =Frank| title =Frank's Compulsive Guide to Postal Addresses| publisher =Columbia University| date =2008-05-17| url =http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/postal.html#europe| accessdate =2008-06-04| url-status =live| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080725104707/http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/postal.html#europe| archivedate =2008-07-25}}</ref><ref name=\"UPU_int_addressing_pdf\">{{citation |title =Formatting an international address |publisher=Universal Postal Union |page=13 |date=January 2010 |url=http://www.upu.int/index.php?eID=tx_mm_bccmsbase_zip&id=18940410994c9f5e9f026f1 |format=PDF |accessdate =2010-09-26 }}</ref> but they have not become widely used.\n\n[[Andorra]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Barbados]], [[Ecuador]], [[Latvia]] and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] use the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] as a prefix in their postal codes.\n\nIn some countries (such as in [[continental Europe]], where a numeric postcode format of four or five digits is commonly used) the numeric postal code is sometimes prefixed with a [[country code]] when sending international mail to that country.\n\n=== Placement of the code ===\nPostal services have their own formats and placement rules for postal codes. In most English-speaking countries, the postal code forms the last item of the address, following the city or town name, whereas in most continental European countries it precedes the name of the city or town.\n\nWhen it follows the city it may be on the same line or on a new line.\n\nIn [[Belarus]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Russia]], [[Turkmenistan]] it is written at the beginning of an address.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n== Geographic coverage ==\nPostal codes are usually assigned to geographical areas. Sometimes codes are assigned to individual addresses or to institutions that receive large volumes of mail, e.g. government agencies or large commercial companies. One example is the French [[Cedex (France)|Cedex]] system.\n\n=== Postal zone numbers ===\nBefore postal codes as described here were used, large cities were often divided into postal zones or postal districts, usually numbered from 1 upwards within each city. The newer postal code systems often incorporate the old zone numbers, as with [[London postal district]] numbers, for example. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] still uses [[Dublin postal districts|postal district numbers]] in [[Dublin]]. In [[New Zealand]], [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]] and [[Christchurch]] were divided into postal zones, but these fell into disuse, and have now become redundant as a result of a new postcode system being introduced.\n\n=== Codes defined along administrative borders ===\nSome postal code systems, like those of [[Ecuador]] and [[Costa Rica]], show an exact agreement with the hierarchy of administrative [[country subdivisions]].\n\nFormat of six digit numeric (eight digit alphanumeric) [[postal codes in Ecuador]], introduced in December 2007: ECAABBCC\n: EC - [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code\n: AA - one of the 24 [[provinces of Ecuador]] (24 of 100 possible codes used = 24%)\n: BB - one of the 226 [[cantons of Ecuador]] (for AABB 226 of 10000 codes used, i.e. 2.26%. Three cantons are not in any province)\n: CC - one of the [[parishes of Ecuador]].\n\nFormat of five digit numeric [[Postal codes in Costa Rica]], introduced in 2007: ABBCC\n: A - one of the seven [[provinces of Costa Rica]] (7 of 10 used, i.e. 70%)\n: BB - one of the 81 [[cantons of Costa Rica]] (81 of 100 used, i.e. 81%)\n: CC - one of the [[districts of Costa Rica]].\nIn Costa Rica these codes are also used by the National Institute for Statistics and Census (INSEC).\n\nThe first two digits of the [[postal codes in Turkey]] correspond to the [[provinces of Turkey|provinces]] and each province has assigned only one number. They are the same for them as in [[ISO 3166-2:TR]].<ref>http://www.postakodumne.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404005656/http://www.postakodumne.com/ |date=2011-04-04 }} | Posta Kodum Ne - Postal Code Reference for Turkey</ref>\n\nThe first two digits of the [[postal codes in Vietnam]] indicate a [[provinces of Vietnam|province]]. Some provinces have one, other have several two digit numbers assigned. The numbers differ from the number used in [[ISO 3166-2:VN]].\n\n=== Codes defined close to administrative boundaries ===\n[[File:MAPA DAS REGI\u00d5ES DE CEP.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Map of Brazilian five-digit postalcodes of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo state]].\nEach color shows a set of administrative areas, and the hierarchy of codes relating indirectly to them.]]\n\nIn France the numeric code for the departments is used as the first two digits of the postal code, except for the two departments in [[Corsica]] that have codes 2A and 2B and use 20 as postal code. Furthermore, the codes are only the codes for the department in charge of delivery of the post, so it can be that a location in one department has a postal code starting with the number of a neighbouring department.\n\n=== Codes defined indirectly to administrative borders ===\nThe first digit of the [[postal codes in the United States]] defines an area including several states. From the first three digits (with some exceptions), one can deduce the state.\n\nSimilarly, in [[Canada Post|Canada]], the first letter indicates the province or territory, although the provinces of [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]] are divided into several lettered sub-regions (e.g. H for [[Montreal]] and [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]]), and the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] share the letter X.\n\n=== Codes defined independently from administrative areas ===\nThe first two digits of the [[postal codes in Germany]] define areas independently of administrative regions. The coding space of the first digit is fully used (0-9); that of the first two combined is utilized to 89%, i.e. there are 89 postal zones defined. Zone 11 is non-geographic.\n\n[[Royal Mail]] designed the [[postal codes in the United Kingdom]] mostly for efficient distribution. Nevertheless, people associated codes with certain areas, leading to some people wanting or not wanting to have a certain code. See also [[postcode lottery]].\n\nIn [[Brazil]] the [[:pt:C\u00f3digo de Endere\u00e7amento Postal|8-digit postcodes]] are an evolution of the five-digit area postal codes. In the 1990s the Brazilian five-digit postal code (illustrated), <code>DDDDD</code>, received a three-digit suffix <code>DDDDD-SSS</code>, but this suffix is not directly related to the administrative district hierarchy. The suffix was created only for logistic reasons.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"220px\" style=\"text-align:center\" caption=\"Brazilian eight-digit postal codes - A city block and its faces\">\nQuadrasExemplo-CEP.png|[[City block]]s surrounded by streets, some streets with a different eight-digit postal code (suffixes 001 to 899).\n\nQuadraExemplo-CEP.png|Faces of a [[city block]] and their extension into its interior.

The same colors (polygons) indicate the same postal codes.\n</gallery>\n\n[[file:QuadraExemplo-CEP-pnt.png|thumb|220px|In the [[Spatialization|code spatialization]] it '''is an error''' to associate the postal code to an individual ''land lot'' area: a lot may have 0, 1, 2 or more delivery points, with different codes.]]\n\nThe postal code assignment can be assigned to individual  [[land lot]]s in some special cases &mdash; in Brazil they are named \"large receivers\" and receive suffixes 900-959. In any other case it is an error to associate the postal code with the whole land lot area (illustrated). \n\nA postal code is often related to a [[land lot]], but this is not always the case. Postal codes are usually related to access points on streets. Small or middle-sized houses, in general, only have a single main gate which is the delivery point. Parks, large businesses such as shopping centers, and big houses, may have more than one entrance and more than one delivery point. So the semantic of an address and its postal code can vary, and one [[land lot]] may have more than one postal code.\n\n=== Precision ===\n==== Czechoslovakia ====\nCzechoslovakia introduced Postal Routing Numbers (PS\u010c - po\u0161tovn\u00ed sm\u011brovac\u00ed \u010d\u00edsla) in 1973. The code consists of 5 digits formatted into two groups: NNN NN. Originally, the first group marked a district transport centre, the second group represented the order of post offices on the collection route. In the first group, the first digit corresponds partly with the region, the second digit meant a collection transport node (sb\u011brn\u00fd p\u0159epravn\u00ed uzel, SPU) and the third digit a \"district transport node\" (okresn\u00ed p\u0159epravn\u00ed uzel). However, processing was later centralized and mechanized while codes remained the same. After separation  Slovakia and the Czech Republic kept the system. Codes with an initial digit of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 are used in the Czech Republic, while codes with an initial digit of 8, 9, or 0 are used in Slovakia\n\nA code corresponds to a local postal office. However, some larger companies or organizations have their own post codes. In 2004\u20132006 there were some efforts in Slovakia to reform the system, to get separate post codes for every district of single postmen, but the change was not realized.\n\n====India====\n{{Further|Postal Index Number}}\n\nPostal codes are known as [[Postal Index Number]]s (PINs; sometimes [[RAS syndrome|redundantly]] as PIN codes) in India. The PIN system was introduced on 15 August 1972 by India Post. India uses a unique six-digit code as a geographical number to identify locations in India. The format of the PIN is ZSDPPP defined as follows:\n\n: Z \u2014 Zone\n: S \u2014 Sub-zone\n: D \u2014 Sorting District\n: PPP \u2014 Post Office\n\nThere are nine total zones consisting of eight regional zones and a functional zone which are represented by the first digit.\n\n==== Ireland ====\n{{Further|Postal addresses in the Republic of Ireland}}\n\nIn Ireland, the new postal code system launched in 2015, known as [[Eircode]] provides a unique code for each individual address.\nThese 7-character alphanumerical codes are in the format:\nA99 XXXX\n\nWhile it is not intended to replace addresses, in theory simply providing a seven-character Eircode would locate any Irish delivery address. For example, the Irish Parliament [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] is: D02 A272\n\nThe first three digits are the routing key, which is a postal district and the last four characters are a unique identifier which relates to an individual address (business, house or apartment). A fully developed API is also available for integrating the Eircode database into business database and logistics systems.\n\n==== Netherlands ====\n{{further|Postal codes in the Netherlands}}\n\n[[Postal codes in the Netherlands]], known as postcodes, are alphanumeric, consisting of four digits followed by a space and two letters (NNNN AA). Adding the house number to the postcode will identify the address, making the street name and town name redundant. For example: 2597 GV 75 will direct a postal delivery to Theo Mann-Bouwmeesterlaan 75, [[The Hague|'s&#8209;Gravenhage]] (the International School of The Hague).\n\n==== Singapore ====\n{{Further|Postal codes in Singapore}}\n\nSince 1 September 1995, every building in Singapore has been given [[postal codes in Singapore|a unique, six-digit postal code]].<ref name=\"Singapore NLB\" />\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n{{Further|Postcodes in the United Kingdom}}\nFor domestic properties, an individual postcode may cover up to 100 properties in contiguous proximity (e.g. a short section of a populous road, or a group of less populous neighbouring roads). The postcode together with the number or name of a property is not always unique, particularly in rural areas. For example, GL20 8NX/1 might refer to either 1 Frampton Cottages or 1 Frampton Farm Cottages, roughly a quarter of a mile (400 metres) apart.\n\nThe structure is alphanumeric, with the following six valid formats, as defined by [[British Standards|BS]] 7666:<ref>{{cite web |title=BS7666 Address |work=Data Standards Catalogue |publisher=UK National Archives |date=2 October 2009 |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/govtalk/schemasstandards/e-gif/datastandards/address/postcode.aspx |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130128101412/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/govtalk/schemasstandards/e-gif/datastandards/address/postcode.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=15 August 2015 }}</ref>\n\n   A9 9AA\n  A9A 9AA\n  A99 9AA\n  AA9 9AA\n AA9A 9AA\n AA99 9AA\n\nThere are always two halves: the separation between outward and inward postcodes is indicated by one space.\n\nThe outward postcode covers a unique area and has two parts which may in total be two, three or four characters in length. A postcode area of one or two letters, followed by one or two numbers, followed in some parts of London by a letter.\n\nThe outward postcode and the leading numeric of the inward postcode in combination forms a postal sector, and this usually corresponds to a couple of thousand properties.\n\nLarger businesses and isolated properties such as farms may have a unique postcode. Extremely large organisations such as larger government offices or bank headquarters may have multiple postcodes for different departments.\n\nThere are about 100 postcode areas, ranging widely in size from [[BT postcode area|BT]] which covers the whole of [[Northern Ireland]] to [[WC postcode area|WC]] for a small part of [[Central London]]. Postcode areas occasionally cross national boundaries, such as [[SY postcode area|SY]] which covers a large, predominantly rural area from [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Ludlow]] in [[Shropshire]], [[England]], through to the seaside town of [[Aberystwyth]], [[Ceredigion]] on [[Wales]]' west coast.\n\n==== United States ====\n{{further|ZIP Code}}\n\nIn the United States, the basic [[ZIP Code]] is composed of five numbers. The first three numbers identify a specific [[sectional center facility]]\u2014or central sorting facility\u2014that serves a geographic region (typically a large part of a state). The next two numbers identify either an area of a city (if in an urban area) or a village/town (if in a suburban/rural area).\n\nThere is an extended format of the ZIP Code known as the [[ZIP+4]], which contains the basic five-digit ZIP Code, followed by a hyphen and four additional digits. These digits identify a specific delivery route, such as one side of a building, a group of apartments, or several floors of a large office building. Although using the ZIP+4 offers higher accuracy, addressing redundancy, and sorting efficiency within the [[USPS]], it is optional and not widely used by the general public. It is primarily only used by business mailers.\n\nFor high volume business mailers using automated mailing machines, the USPS has promulgated the [[Intelligent Mail barcode]] standard, which is a barcode containing the ZIP+4 code plus a two digit [[delivery point]]. This 11-digit number is theoretically a unique identifier for every address in the country.\n\n=== States and overseas territories sharing a postal code system ===\nFrench overseas departments and territories use the five-digit [[French postal code system]], each code starting with the three-digit department identifier. [[Monaco]] is also integrated in the French system and has no system of its own.\n\nThe British [[Crown dependencies]] of [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]] are part of the UK postcode system. They use the schemes AAN NAA and AANN NAA, in which the first two letters are a unique code (GY, JE and IM respectively).\n\nMost of the Overseas Territories have UK-style postcodes, with a single postcode for each territory or dependency, although they are still treated as international destinations by Royal Mail in the UK, and charged at international rather than UK inland rates. The four other Overseas Territories [[Anguilla]], [[Bermuda]], [[British Virgin Islands]] and [[Cayman Islands]] have their own separate systems and formats.\n\nThe Pacific island states of [[Palau]], [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] remain part of the US [[ZIP code]] system, despite having become independent states.\n\n[[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City]] are part of the [[Italy|Italian]] postcode system, while [[Liechtenstein]] similarly uses the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] system, as do the Italian exclave of [[Campione d'Italia]] and the German exclave of [[B\u00fcsingen am Hochrhein]], although they also form part of their respective countries' postal code systems.\n\nThe [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] still uses the codes of the former [[Czechoslovakia]], their ranges not overlapping. In 2004\u20132006, Slovakia prepared a reform of the system but the plan was postponed and maybe abandoned. In Czechia, there was no significant effort to modify the system.\n\n== Non-geographic codes ==\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the non-conforming postal code GIR 0AA was used for the [[Girobank|National Girobank]] until its closure in 2003.<ref>[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/40-facts-postcode-mark-40th-4113087 40 facts about the postcode to mark 40th anniversary as vital part of daily life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316214017/https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/40-facts-postcode-mark-40th-4113087 |date=2018-03-16 }}, Daily Mirror, 26 August 2014</ref> A non-geographic series of postcodes, starting with BX, is used by some banks and government departments.\n\n:HM Revenue and Customs - VAT Controller\n:VAT Central Unit\n:BX5 5AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-insolvency|title=VAT: insolvency|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106095712/https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-insolvency|archivedate=6 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nA fictional address is also used by Royal Mail for letters to Santa Claus, more commonly known as Santa or Father Christmas:\n\n:Santa\u2019s Grotto\n:Reindeerland XM4 5HQ<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/10494193/Who-answers-all-the-letters-sent-to-Father-Christmas.html Who answers all the letters sent to Father Christmas?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225004304/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/10494193/Who-answers-all-the-letters-sent-to-Father-Christmas.html |date=2016-12-25 }}, ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 5 December 2013</ref>\n\nPreviously, the postcode SAN TA1 was used.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2565041.stm Santa: 'I'm not a Superman, but I do exist'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112001840/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2565041.stm |date=2008-01-12 }}, [[BBC News Online]], 11 December 2002</ref>\n\nIn [[Finland]] the special postal code 99999 is for [[Korvatunturi]], the place where Santa Claus (''Joulupukki'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) is said to live, although mail is delivered to the [[Santa Claus Village]] in [[Rovaniemi]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=W7cDCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA84&ots=vB2rnvZS2A&dq=99999%20korvatunturi&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=99999%20korvatunturi&f=false ''Not For Parents Travel Book''], [[Lonely Planet]], 2012, page 84</ref>\n\nIn [[Canada]] the amount of mail sent to Santa Claus increased every [[Christmas]], up to the point that Canada Post decided to start an official Santa Claus letter-response program in 1983.

One example is the French [[Cedex (France)|CEDEX]] system.\n\n== Terms ==\nThere are a number of synonyms for postal code; some are country-specific.\n* '''[[Codice di Avviamento Postale|CAP]]''': The standard term in Italy; CAP is an acronym for ''codice di avviamento postale'' (postal expedition code).\n* '''[[C\u00f3digo de Endere\u00e7amento Postal|CEP]]''': The standard term in Brazil; CEP is an acronym for ''c\u00f3digo de endere\u00e7amento postal'' (postal addressing code).\n* '''[[Eircode]]''': The standard term in Ireland.\n* '''[[Postal codes in Switzerland and Liechtenstein|NPA]]''' in [[Romandy|French-speaking Switzerland]] (''num\u00e9ro postal d'acheminement'') and [[Ticino|Italian-speaking Switzerland]] (''numero postale di avviamento'').\n* '''[[Postal Index Number|PIN]]''': The standard term in India; PIN is an acronym for Postal Index Number. Sometimes [[RAS syndrome|redundantly]] called a PIN code.\n* '''PLZ''': The standard term in Germany, Austria, [[German-speaking Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]]; PLZ is an abbreviation of ''Postleitzahl'' (postal routing number).\n* '''Postal code''': The general term is used in Canada.\n* '''Postcode''': This [[compound (linguistics)|solid compound]] is popular in many English-speaking countries and is also the standard term in the Netherlands.\n*'''[[:cs:Po\u0161tovn\u00ed sm\u011brovac\u00ed \u010d\u00edslo|PS\u010c]]''': The standard term in Slovakia and Czech Republic; PS\u010c is an acronym for ''Po\u0161tov\u00e9 smerovacie \u010d\u00edslo'' (in Slovak) or ''Po\u0161tovn\u00ed sm\u011brovac\u00ed \u010d\u00edslo'' (in Czech), both meaning postal routing number.\n* '''[[ZIP code]]''': The standard term in the United States and the Philippines; ZIP is an [[acronym]] for Zone Improvement Plan.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Stamp Soviet Union 1977 CPA 4775.jpg|thumb|1970s Soviet stamp promoting the use of postal codes]]\nThe development of postal codes reflects the increasing complexity of postal delivery as populations grew and the [[built environment]] became more complex. This happened first in large cities. Postal codes began with postal district numbers (or postal zone numbers) within large cities. [[London]] was first subdivided into 10 districts in 1857, and [[Liverpool]] in 1864. By [[World War I]], such postal district or zone numbers existed in various large European cities. They existed in the United States at least as early as the 1920s, possibly implemented at the local post office level only (for example, instances of \"Boston 9, Mass\" in 1920 are attested,<ref name=\"1920_advert_Lynd_Farquhar_Co\">{{Cite journal |author=Lynd-Farquhar Co |title=Advertisement for machine tools, 1920 |journal=American Machinist |page=388 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezRMAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA388|postscript=. |year=1920}}</ref><ref name=\"1920_advert_Hill_Clarke_Co\">{{Cite journal |author1=Hill, Clarke  |author2=Co, Inc  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Advertisement for a drill press, 1920 |journal=American Machinist |page=389 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezRMAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA389|postscript=. |year=1920}}</ref>) although they were evidently not used throughout all major US cities (implemented [[United States Post Office Department|USPOD]]-wide) until [[World War II]].\n\nBy 1930 or earlier the idea of extending postal district or zone numbering plans beyond large cities to cover even small towns and rural locales was in the air. These developed into postal codes as they are defined today. The name of US postal codes, \"ZIP codes\", reflects this evolutionary growth from a zone plan to a zone improvement plan, \"ZIP\". Modern postal codes were first introduced in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] in December 1932,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upns.org/article/85-first-postal-zip-code |title=The First Postal (ZIP) Code in the World |publisher=Ukrainian Philatelic and Numismatic Society |date=2009-04-20 |accessdate=2010-03-04 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423155849/http://www.upns.org/article/85-first-postal-zip-code |archivedate=2010-04-23 }}</ref> but the system was abandoned in 1939.

The letter combinations \"SS\" ([[Schutzstaffel]]), \"SD\"([[Sicherheitsdienst]]), and \"SA\" ([[Sturmabteilung]]) are not used for historical reasons.\n\n[[Postal codes in Canada]] do not include the letters D, F, I, O, Q, or U, as the [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) equipment used in automated sorting could easily confuse them with other letters and digits. The letters W and Z are used, but are not currently used as the first letter. The Canadian Postal Codes use alternate letters and numbers (with a space after the 3rd character) in this format: A9A 9A9<ref name=GreatData.com>{{cite web|title=GreatData.com (a licensee of Canada Post data)|url=http://greatdata.com|accessdate=8 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402154507/http://greatdata.com/|archivedate=2 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Ireland]] the [[eircode]] system uses the following letters only: A, C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, T, V, W, X, Y. This serves two purposes:\n* to avoid confusion in OCR, and\n* it also helps to avoid accidental double-entendres by avoiding the creation of word look-alikes, as Eircode's last four characters are random.\n\n==== Alphanumeric postal codes ====\nMost of the postal code systems are numeric; only a few are alphanumeric (i.e., use both letters and digits). Alphanumeric systems can, given the same number of characters, encode many more locations. For example, while a two digit numeric code can represent 100 locations, a two character alphanumeric code using ten numbers and twenty letters can represent 900 locations.\n\nThe independent nations using alphanumeric postal code systems are:\n* [[Argentina]] ([[Postal codes in Argentina|see table]])\n* [[Brunei]] ([[Postal codes in Brunei|see table]])\n* [[Canada]] ([[Postal codes in Canada|see table]])\n* [[Eswatini]]\n* [[Ireland]] ([[Postal addresses in the Republic of Ireland|see table]])\n* [[Jamaica]] ([[Postal codes in Jamaica|see table]]) (suspended in 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaicapost.gov.jm/corporate_news/pressrelease_07.htm |title=Post Code Project Suspended Indefinitely |work=Press Release 07 published in Daily Gleaner |publisher=Jamaica Post |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2010-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226125027/http://www.jamaicapost.gov.jm/corporate_news/pressrelease_07.htm |archivedate=2010-02-26 }}</ref>)\n* [[Kazakhstan]] (since 2015)\n* [[Malta]] ([[Postal codes in Malta|see table]])\n* [[Netherlands]] ([[Postal codes in the Netherlands|see table]])\n* [[Peru]] ([[List of postal codes in Peru|see table]]) The postal code format in Peru was updated in February 2011 to be of the format of five digits.\n* [[Somalia]]\n* [[United Kingdom]] ([[Postcodes in the United Kingdom|see table]])\n\nCountries which prefix their postal codes with a fixed group of letters, indicating a country code, include [[Andorra]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Barbados]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]].\n\n=== Country code prefixes ===\n[[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country codes were recommended by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] as well as the [[Universal Postal Union]] to be used in conjunction with postal codes starting in 1994,<ref name=\"daCruz_ColumbiaUni\">{{cite web| last =da Cruz| first =Frank| title =Frank's Compulsive Guide to Postal Addresses| publisher =Columbia University| date =2008-05-17| url =http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/postal.html#europe| accessdate =2008-06-04| url-status =live| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080725104707/http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/postal.html#europe| archivedate =2008-07-25}}</ref><ref name=\"UPU_int_addressing_pdf\">{{citation |title =Formatting an international address |publisher=Universal Postal Union |page=13 |date=January 2010 |url=http://www.upu.int/index.php?eID=tx_mm_bccmsbase_zip&id=18940410994c9f5e9f026f1 |format=PDF |accessdate =2010-09-26 }}</ref> but they have not become widely used.\n\n[[Andorra]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Barbados]], [[Ecuador]], [[Latvia]] and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] use the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] as a prefix in their postal codes.\n\nIn some countries (such as in [[continental Europe]], where a numeric postcode format of four or five digits is commonly used) the numeric postal code is sometimes prefixed with a [[country code]] when sending international mail to that country.\n\n=== Placement of the code ===\nPostal services have their own formats and placement rules for postal codes. In most English-speaking countries, the postal code forms the last item of the address, following the city or town name, whereas in most continental European countries it precedes the name of the city or town.\n\nWhen it follows the city it may be on the same line or on a new line.\n\nIn [[Belarus]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Russia]], [[Turkmenistan]] it is written at the beginning of an address.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n== Geographic coverage ==\nPostal codes are usually assigned to geographical areas. Sometimes codes are assigned to individual addresses or to institutions that receive large volumes of mail, e.g. government agencies or large commercial companies. One example is the French [[Cedex (France)|Cedex]] system.\n\n=== Postal zone numbers ===\nBefore postal codes as described here were used, large cities were often divided into postal zones or postal districts, usually numbered from 1 upwards within each city. The newer postal code systems often incorporate the old zone numbers, as with [[London postal district]] numbers, for example. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] still uses [[Dublin postal districts|postal district numbers]] in [[Dublin]]. In [[New Zealand]], [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]] and [[Christchurch]] were divided into postal zones, but these fell into disuse, and have now become redundant as a result of a new postcode system being introduced.\n\n=== Codes defined along administrative borders ===\nSome postal code systems, like those of [[Ecuador]] and [[Costa Rica]], show an exact agreement with the hierarchy of administrative [[country subdivisions]].\n\nFormat of six digit numeric (eight digit alphanumeric) [[postal codes in Ecuador]], introduced in December 2007: ECAABBCC\n: EC - [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code\n: AA - one of the 24 [[provinces of Ecuador]] (24 of 100 possible codes used = 24%)\n: BB - one of the 226 [[cantons of Ecuador]] (for AABB 226 of 10000 codes used, i.e. 2.26%. Three cantons are not in any province)\n: CC - one of the [[parishes of Ecuador]].\n\nFormat of five digit numeric [[Postal codes in Costa Rica]], introduced in 2007: ABBCC\n: A - one of the seven [[provinces of Costa Rica]] (7 of 10 used, i.e. 70%)\n: BB - one of the 81 [[cantons of Costa Rica]] (81 of 100 used, i.e. 81%)\n: CC - one of the [[districts of Costa Rica]].\nIn Costa Rica these codes are also used by the National Institute for Statistics and Census (INSEC).\n\nThe first two digits of the [[postal codes in Turkey]] correspond to the [[provinces of Turkey|provinces]] and each province has assigned only one number.

The numbers differ from the number used in [[ISO 3166-2:VN]].\n\n=== Codes defined close to administrative boundaries ===\n[[File:MAPA DAS REGI\u00d5ES DE CEP.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Map of Brazilian five-digit postalcodes of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo state]].\nEach color shows a set of administrative areas, and the hierarchy of codes relating indirectly to them.]]\n\nIn France the numeric code for the departments is used as the first two digits of the postal code, except for the two departments in [[Corsica]] that have codes 2A and 2B and use 20 as postal code. Furthermore, the codes are only the codes for the department in charge of delivery of the post, so it can be that a location in one department has a postal code starting with the number of a neighbouring department.\n\n=== Codes defined indirectly to administrative borders ===\nThe first digit of the [[postal codes in the United States]] defines an area including several states. From the first three digits (with some exceptions), one can deduce the state.\n\nSimilarly, in [[Canada Post|Canada]], the first letter indicates the province or territory, although the provinces of [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]] are divided into several lettered sub-regions (e.g. H for [[Montreal]] and [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]]), and the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] share the letter X.\n\n=== Codes defined independently from administrative areas ===\nThe first two digits of the [[postal codes in Germany]] define areas independently of administrative regions. The coding space of the first digit is fully used (0-9); that of the first two combined is utilized to 89%, i.e. there are 89 postal zones defined. Zone 11 is non-geographic.\n\n[[Royal Mail]] designed the [[postal codes in the United Kingdom]] mostly for efficient distribution. Nevertheless, people associated codes with certain areas, leading to some people wanting or not wanting to have a certain code. See also [[postcode lottery]].\n\nIn [[Brazil]] the [[:pt:C\u00f3digo de Endere\u00e7amento Postal|8-digit postcodes]] are an evolution of the five-digit area postal codes. In the 1990s the Brazilian five-digit postal code (illustrated), <code>DDDDD</code>, received a three-digit suffix <code>DDDDD-SSS</code>, but this suffix is not directly related to the administrative district hierarchy. The suffix was created only for logistic reasons.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"220px\" style=\"text-align:center\" caption=\"Brazilian eight-digit postal codes - A city block and its faces\">\nQuadrasExemplo-CEP.png|[[City block]]s surrounded by streets, some streets with a different eight-digit postal code (suffixes 001 to 899).\n\nQuadraExemplo-CEP.png|Faces of a [[city block]] and their extension into its interior.

The same colors (polygons) indicate the same postal codes.\n</gallery>\n\n[[file:QuadraExemplo-CEP-pnt.png|thumb|220px|In the [[Spatialization|code spatialization]] it '''is an error''' to associate the postal code to an individual ''land lot'' area: a lot may have 0, 1, 2 or more delivery points, with different codes.]]\n\nThe postal code assignment can be assigned to individual  [[land lot]]s in some special cases &mdash; in Brazil they are named \"large receivers\" and receive suffixes 900-959. In any other case it is an error to associate the postal code with the whole land lot area (illustrated). \n\nA postal code is often related to a [[land lot]], but this is not always the case. Postal codes are usually related to access points on streets. Small or middle-sized houses, in general, only have a single main gate which is the delivery point. Parks, large businesses such as shopping centers, and big houses, may have more than one entrance and more than one delivery point. So the semantic of an address and its postal code can vary, and one [[land lot]] may have more than one postal code.\n\n=== Precision ===\n==== Czechoslovakia ====\nCzechoslovakia introduced Postal Routing Numbers (PS\u010c - po\u0161tovn\u00ed sm\u011brovac\u00ed \u010d\u00edsla) in 1973. The code consists of 5 digits formatted into two groups: NNN NN. Originally, the first group marked a district transport centre, the second group represented the order of post offices on the collection route. In the first group, the first digit corresponds partly with the region, the second digit meant a collection transport node (sb\u011brn\u00fd p\u0159epravn\u00ed uzel, SPU) and the third digit a \"district transport node\" (okresn\u00ed p\u0159epravn\u00ed uzel). However, processing was later centralized and mechanized while codes remained the same. After separation  Slovakia and the Czech Republic kept the system. Codes with an initial digit of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 are used in the Czech Republic, while codes with an initial digit of 8, 9, or 0 are used in Slovakia\n\nA code corresponds to a local postal office. However, some larger companies or organizations have their own post codes. In 2004\u20132006 there were some efforts in Slovakia to reform the system, to get separate post codes for every district of single postmen, but the change was not realized.\n\n====India====\n{{Further|Postal Index Number}}\n\nPostal codes are known as [[Postal Index Number]]s (PINs; sometimes [[RAS syndrome|redundantly]] as PIN codes) in India. The PIN system was introduced on 15 August 1972 by India Post. India uses a unique six-digit code as a geographical number to identify locations in India. The format of the PIN is ZSDPPP defined as follows:\n\n: Z \u2014 Zone\n: S \u2014 Sub-zone\n: D \u2014 Sorting District\n: PPP \u2014 Post Office\n\nThere are nine total zones consisting of eight regional zones and a functional zone which are represented by the first digit.\n\n==== Ireland ====\n{{Further|Postal addresses in the Republic of Ireland}}\n\nIn Ireland, the new postal code system launched in 2015, known as [[Eircode]] provides a unique code for each individual address.\nThese 7-character alphanumerical codes are in the format:\nA99 XXXX\n\nWhile it is not intended to replace addresses, in theory simply providing a seven-character Eircode would locate any Irish delivery address. For example, the Irish Parliament [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] is: D02 A272\n\nThe first three digits are the routing key, which is a postal district and the last four characters are a unique identifier which relates to an individual address (business, house or apartment). A fully developed API is also available for integrating the Eircode database into business database and logistics systems.\n\n==== Netherlands ====\n{{further|Postal codes in the Netherlands}}\n\n[[Postal codes in the Netherlands]], known as postcodes, are alphanumeric, consisting of four digits followed by a space and two letters (NNNN AA). Adding the house number to the postcode will identify the address, making the street name and town name redundant. For example: 2597 GV 75 will direct a postal delivery to Theo Mann-Bouwmeesterlaan 75, [[The Hague|'s&#8209;Gravenhage]] (the International School of The Hague).\n\n==== Singapore ====\n{{Further|Postal codes in Singapore}}\n\nSince 1 September 1995, every building in Singapore has been given [[postal codes in Singapore|a unique, six-digit postal code]].<ref name=\"Singapore NLB\" />\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n{{Further|Postcodes in the United Kingdom}}\nFor domestic properties, an individual postcode may cover up to 100 properties in contiguous proximity (e.g. a short section of a populous road, or a group of less populous neighbouring roads). The postcode together with the number or name of a property is not always unique, particularly in rural areas. For example, GL20 8NX/1 might refer to either 1 Frampton Cottages or 1 Frampton Farm Cottages, roughly a quarter of a mile (400 metres) apart.\n\nThe structure is alphanumeric, with the following six valid formats, as defined by [[British Standards|BS]] 7666:<ref>{{cite web |title=BS7666 Address |work=Data Standards Catalogue |publisher=UK National Archives |date=2 October 2009 |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/govtalk/schemasstandards/e-gif/datastandards/address/postcode.aspx |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130128101412/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/govtalk/schemasstandards/e-gif/datastandards/address/postcode.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=15 August 2015 }}</ref>\n\n   A9 9AA\n  A9A 9AA\n  A99 9AA\n  AA9 9AA\n AA9A 9AA\n AA99 9AA\n\nThere are always two halves: the separation between outward and inward postcodes is indicated by one space.\n\nThe outward postcode covers a unique area and has two parts which may in total be two, three or four characters in length. A postcode area of one or two letters, followed by one or two numbers, followed in some parts of London by a letter.\n\nThe outward postcode and the leading numeric of the inward postcode in combination forms a postal sector, and this usually corresponds to a couple of thousand properties.\n\nLarger businesses and isolated properties such as farms may have a unique postcode. Extremely large organisations such as larger government offices or bank headquarters may have multiple postcodes for different departments.\n\nThere are about 100 postcode areas, ranging widely in size from [[BT postcode area|BT]] which covers the whole of [[Northern Ireland]] to [[WC postcode area|WC]] for a small part of [[Central London]]. Postcode areas occasionally cross national boundaries, such as [[SY postcode area|SY]] which covers a large, predominantly rural area from [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Ludlow]] in [[Shropshire]], [[England]], through to the seaside town of [[Aberystwyth]], [[Ceredigion]] on [[Wales]]' west coast.\n\n==== United States ====\n{{further|ZIP Code}}\n\nIn the United States, the basic [[ZIP Code]] is composed of five numbers. The first three numbers identify a specific [[sectional center facility]]\u2014or central sorting facility\u2014that serves a geographic region (typically a large part of a state). The next two numbers identify either an area of a city (if in an urban area) or a village/town (if in a suburban/rural area).\n\nThere is an extended format of the ZIP Code known as the [[ZIP+4]], which contains the basic five-digit ZIP Code, followed by a hyphen and four additional digits. These digits identify a specific delivery route, such as one side of a building, a group of apartments, or several floors of a large office building. Although using the ZIP+4 offers higher accuracy, addressing redundancy, and sorting efficiency within the [[USPS]], it is optional and not widely used by the general public. It is primarily only used by business mailers.\n\nFor high volume business mailers using automated mailing machines, the USPS has promulgated the [[Intelligent Mail barcode]] standard, which is a barcode containing the ZIP+4 code plus a two digit [[delivery point]]. This 11-digit number is theoretically a unique identifier for every address in the country.\n\n=== States and overseas territories sharing a postal code system ===\nFrench overseas departments and territories use the five-digit [[French postal code system]], each code starting with the three-digit department identifier. [[Monaco]] is also integrated in the French system and has no system of its own.\n\nThe British [[Crown dependencies]] of [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]] are part of the UK postcode system. They use the schemes AAN NAA and AANN NAA, in which the first two letters are a unique code (GY, JE and IM respectively).\n\nMost of the Overseas Territories have UK-style postcodes, with a single postcode for each territory or dependency, although they are still treated as international destinations by Royal Mail in the UK, and charged at international rather than UK inland rates. The four other Overseas Territories [[Anguilla]], [[Bermuda]], [[British Virgin Islands]] and [[Cayman Islands]] have their own separate systems and formats.\n\nThe Pacific island states of [[Palau]], [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] remain part of the US [[ZIP code]] system, despite having become independent states.\n\n[[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City]] are part of the [[Italy|Italian]] postcode system, while [[Liechtenstein]] similarly uses the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] system, as do the Italian exclave of [[Campione d'Italia]] and the German exclave of [[B\u00fcsingen am Hochrhein]], although they also form part of their respective countries' postal code systems.\n\nThe [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] still uses the codes of the former [[Czechoslovakia]], their ranges not overlapping. In 2004\u20132006, Slovakia prepared a reform of the system but the plan was postponed and maybe abandoned. In Czechia, there was no significant effort to modify the system.\n\n== Non-geographic codes ==\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the non-conforming postal code GIR 0AA was used for the [[Girobank|National Girobank]] until its closure in 2003.<ref>[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/40-facts-postcode-mark-40th-4113087 40 facts about the postcode to mark 40th anniversary as vital part of daily life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316214017/https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/40-facts-postcode-mark-40th-4113087 |date=2018-03-16 }}, Daily Mirror, 26 August 2014</ref> A non-geographic series of postcodes, starting with BX, is used by some banks and government departments.\n\n:HM Revenue and Customs - VAT Controller\n:VAT Central Unit\n:BX5 5AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-insolvency|title=VAT: insolvency|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106095712/https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-insolvency|archivedate=6 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nA fictional address is also used by Royal Mail for letters to Santa Claus, more commonly known as Santa or Father Christmas:\n\n:Santa\u2019s Grotto\n:Reindeerland XM4 5HQ<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/10494193/Who-answers-all-the-letters-sent-to-Father-Christmas.html Who answers all the letters sent to Father Christmas?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225004304/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/10494193/Who-answers-all-the-letters-sent-to-Father-Christmas.html |date=2016-12-25 }}, ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 5 December 2013</ref>\n\nPreviously, the postcode SAN TA1 was used.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2565041.stm Santa: 'I'm not a Superman, but I do exist'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112001840/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2565041.stm |date=2008-01-12 }}, [[BBC News Online]], 11 December 2002</ref>\n\nIn [[Finland]] the special postal code 99999 is for [[Korvatunturi]], the place where Santa Claus (''Joulupukki'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) is said to live, although mail is delivered to the [[Santa Claus Village]] in [[Rovaniemi]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=W7cDCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA84&ots=vB2rnvZS2A&dq=99999%20korvatunturi&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=99999%20korvatunturi&f=false ''Not For Parents Travel Book''], [[Lonely Planet]], 2012, page 84</ref>\n\nIn [[Canada]] the amount of mail sent to Santa Claus increased every [[Christmas]], up to the point that Canada Post decided to start an official Santa Claus letter-response program in 1983.

Among uses are:\n* Finding the nearest branch of an organisation to a given address. A computer program uses the postal codes of the target address and the branches to list the closest branches in order of distance [[as the crow flies]] (or, if used in conjunction with street map software, road distance). This can be used by companies to inform potential customers where to go, by [[job centre]]s to find jobs for job-seekers, to alert people of [[town planning]] applications in their area, and a great many other applications.<ref name=planning>{{cite news |author=Charles Arthur |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/oct/07/newly-asked-question-royal-mail-postzon |title=Guardian newspaper article on postcodes |work=Theguardian.com |accessdate=2018-02-26 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043135/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/oct/07/newly-asked-question-royal-mail-postzon |archivedate=2017-12-01 }}</ref>\n* Fine-grained postal codes can be used with [[satellite navigation]] systems to navigate to an address by street number and postcode.\n* Geographical sales territories for representatives in the pharmaceutical industry are allocated based on a workload index that is based upon postcode.\n\n=== Availability ===\nThe availability of postal code information has significant economic advantages.
