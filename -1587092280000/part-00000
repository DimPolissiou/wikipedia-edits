In 1570, he enlisted in a [[Spanish Marine Infantry|Spanish Navy infantry]] regiment, and was badly wounded at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in October 1571. He served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by [[Barbary pirates]]; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to [[Madrid]].\n\nHis first significant novel, titled ''[[La Galatea]]'', was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, then later a government [[tax collector]]. Part One of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1605, and its immediate success allowed him to write full time for the first time. \n\nPart Two of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1615, other publications include ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'', or ''Exemplary Novels'', ''[[Viaje del Parnaso]]'', or ''Journey to Parnassus'', and ''Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses''. ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', or ''The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda'', was published after his death in 1616.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Capilla_del_Oidor%2C_Alcal\u00e1_de_Henares.jpg|thumb|''Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor'', in [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]], where Cervantes was reputedly baptised; the square in front is named ''Plaza Cervantes'']]\nDespite his subsequent fame, much of Cervantes' life is uncertain, including his name, background and what he looked like. Although he signed himself ''Cerbantes'', his printers used ''Cervantes'', which became the common form. In later life, Cervantes used ''Saavedra'', the name of a distant relative, rather than the more usual ''Cortinas'', after his mother.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nAnother area of dispute are his ethnic origins. In the 16th century, many Spaniards were descended either from [[Morisco]]s, Muslims who remained after the conquest of [[Emirate_of_Granada|Granada]] in 1492, or [[Converso]]s, Jews who converted to Catholicism after [[Expulsion_of_Jews_from_Spain|expulsion from Spain in 1492]]. An estimated 20% of the Spanish population in the south fell into one of these categories, and it has been suggested Cervantes' mother may have been one of these [[New Christians]].{{sfn|Byron|1978|p=32}} However, others refute this theory.{{sfn|Lokos|p=116}} \n\nNo confirmed portrait of the author is known to exist.

He was the second son of [[barber-surgeon]] Rodrigo de Cervantes and his wife, Leonor de Cortinas (ca 1520\u20131593).{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=35}} Rodrigo came from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], where his father Juan de Cervantes was an influential lawyer.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=32}} \n\nRodrigo was frequently in debt, or searching for work, and moved constantly. Leonor came from [[Arganda del Rey]], and died in October 1593, at the age of 73; surviving legal documents indicate she had seven children, could read and write, and was a resourceful individual with an eye for business. When Rodrigo was imprisoned for debt from October 1553 to April 1554, she supported the family on her own.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=34}}     \n\nCervantes' siblings were Andr\u00e9s (born 1543), Andrea (born 1544), Luisa (born 1546), Rodrigo (born 1550), Magdalena (born 1554) and Juan. They lived in C\u00f3rdoba until 1556, when his grandfather died; for reasons that are unclear, Rodrigo did not benefit from his will, and the family disappears until 1564, when he filed a lawsuit in [[Seville]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=36}}\n\nSeville was then in the midst of an economic boom, and Rodrigo managed rented accommodation for his elder brother Andres, who was a junior magistrate. It is assumed Cervantes attended the Jesuit college in Seville, where one of the teachers was Jesuit playwright Pedro Pablo Acevedo, who moved there in 1561 from C\u00f3rdoba.{{sfn|Egginton|2016|p=23}} However, legal records show his father got into debt once more, and in 1566, the family moved to [[Madrid]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===1566 to 1580; Military service and captivity===\n[[File:Cervantes Burgos.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Bust of Cervantes erected in 1905, [[Burgos]].]]\nIn the 19th century, a biographer discovered an arrest warrant for a Miguel de Cervantes, dated 15 September 1569, who was charged with wounding Antonio de Sigura in a duel.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=48}} Although disputed at the time, largely on the grounds such behaviour was unworthy of so great an author, it is now accepted as the most likely reason for Cervantes leaving Madrid.{{sfn|Lokos|2016|p=118}}\n\nHe eventually made his way to Rome, where he found a position in the household of Giulio Acquaviva, an Italian bishop who spent 1568 to 1569 in Madrid, and was appointed [[Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)|Cardinal]] in 1570.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=50}} When the 1570 to 1573 [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian_War_(1570\u20131573)|Ottoman\u2013Venetian War]] began, Spain formed part of the [[Holy_League_(1571)|Holy League]], a coalition formed to support the [[Republic_of_Venice|Venetian Republic]].

The ''Marquesa'' lost 40 dead, and 120 wounded, including Cervantes, who received three separate wounds, two in the chest, and another that rendered his left arm useless.

This made finding employment difficult; other than a period in 1581 to 1582, when he was employed as an intelligence agent in North Africa, little is known of his movements prior to 1584.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=100\u2013101}} \n\nIn April of that year, Cervantes visited [[Esquivias]], to help arrange the affairs of his recently deceased friend and minor poet, Pedro Lainez. Here he met Catalina de Salazar y Palacios (ca 1566?\u20131626), eldest daughter of the widowed Catalina de Palacios; her husband died leaving only debts, but the elder Catalina owned some land of her own. This may be why in December 1584, Cervantes married her daughter, then between 15 and 18 years old.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=115\u2013116}} The first use of the name ''Cervantes Saavedra'' appears in 1586, on documents related to his marriage.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nShortly before this, his illegitimate daughter Isabel was born in November. Her mother, Ana Franca, was the wife of a Madrid inn keeper; they apparently concealed it from her husband, but Cervantes acknowledged paternity.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=113}} When Ana Franca died in 1598, he asked his sister Magdalena to take care of her.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=206}}    \n[[File:Trinitmad.jpg|thumb|right|Cervantes was buried at the [[Convento de las Monjas Trinitarias Descalzas|Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians]] in Madrid.]]\nIn 1587, Cervantes was appointed as a government purchasing agent, then became a tax collector in 1592. Such positions were unpaid, and assumed the holder lived on what they kept, which meant a degree of 'corruption' was expected. They were also subject to price fluctuations, which could go either way; he was briefly jailed several times for 'irregularities', but quickly released.

Such works were extremely short-lived, and even [[Lope de Vega]], the best-known playwright of the day, could not live on their proceeds.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=112}} In 1585, he published ''La Galatea'', a conventional [[Pastoral]] romance that received little contemporary notice; despite promising to write a sequel, he never did so.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nAside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In ''Don Quixote'', he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' [[chivalric romance]]s.{{sfn|Close|2008|p=39}} His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular.

In the foreword to his 1613 work, ''Novelas ejemplares'', dedicated to his patron, the Count of Lemos, Cervantes promises to produce one, but was pre-empted by an unauthorised version published in 1614, published under the name [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda]]. It is possible this delay was deliberate, to ensure support from his publisher and reading public; Cervantes finally produced the second part of ''Don Quixote'' in 1615.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=234\u2013235}}\n\nThe two parts of ''Don Quixote'' are different in focus, but similar in their clarity of prose, and realism; the first was more comic, and had greater popular appeal.{{sfn|Mitsuo|2006|pp=148\u2013152}} The second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex, with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight.{{sfn|Putnam|1976|p=14}}  \n\nIn addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled ''Exemplary Novels'', similar in style to [[picaresque novel]]s written by [[Lazarillo de Tormes]]. This was followed by ''Viaje del Parnaso'', or ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'', and ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.\n\nHe was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century; literary editor [[John Bowle (writer)|John Bowle]] argued Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure.{{sfn|Truman|2003|pp=9\u201331}} However, ''Don Quixote'' has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author [[Carlos Fuentes]] suggested Cervantes and his contemporary [[William Shakespeare]] form part of a narrative tradition, which includes [[Homer]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], and [[James Joyce|Joyce]].{{sfn|Fuentes|1988|p=69\u201370}} \n\n[[Sigmund Freud]] claimed he learnt Spanish to read Cervantes in the original; he particularly admired ''El coloquio de los perros'', or ''[[The_Dialogue_of_the_Dogs|Dialogue of the Dogs]]'', from ''Exemplary Tales''.

Despite this, his influence and literary contribution is reflected by the fact Spanish is often referred to as \"the language of Cervantes\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=La lengua de Cervantes |language=Spanish |url=http://www.cepc.es/rap/Publicaciones/Revistas/2/REP_031-032_288.pdf |publisher=Ministerio de la Presidencia de Espa\u00f1a |accessdate=14 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003083955/http://www.cepc.es/rap/Publicaciones/Revistas/2/REP_031-032_288.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2008 }}</ref> \n\nIn 1569, Cervantes was forced to leave Spain and moved to Rome, where he worked in the household of a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]]. In 1570, he enlisted in a [[Spanish Marine Infantry|Spanish Navy infantry]] regiment, and was badly wounded at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in October 1571. He served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by [[Barbary pirates]]; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to [[Madrid]].\n\nHis first significant novel, titled ''[[La Galatea]]'', was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, then later a government [[tax collector]]. Part One of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1605, and its immediate success allowed him to write full time for the first time. \n\nPart Two of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1615, other publications include ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'', or ''Exemplary Novels'', ''[[Viaje del Parnaso]]'', or ''Journey to Parnassus'', and ''Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses''. ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', or ''The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda'', was published after his death in 1616.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Capilla_del_Oidor%2C_Alcal\u00e1_de_Henares.jpg|thumb|''Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor'', in [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]], where Cervantes was reputedly baptised; the square in front is named ''Plaza Cervantes'']]\nDespite his subsequent fame, much of Cervantes' life is uncertain, including his name, background and what he looked like. Although he signed himself ''Cerbantes'', his printers used ''Cervantes'', which became the common form. In later life, Cervantes used ''Saavedra'', the name of a distant relative, rather than the more usual ''Cortinas'', after his mother.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nAnother area of dispute are his ethnic origins. In the 16th century, many Spaniards were descended either from [[Morisco]]s, Muslims who remained after the conquest of [[Emirate_of_Granada|Granada]] in 1492, or [[Converso]]s, Jews who converted to Catholicism after [[Expulsion_of_Jews_from_Spain|expulsion from Spain in 1492]]. An estimated 20% of the Spanish population in the south fell into one of these categories, and it has been suggested Cervantes' mother may have been one of these [[New Christians]].{{sfn|Byron|1978|p=32}} However, others refute this theory.{{sfn|Lokos|p=116}} \n\nNo confirmed portrait of the author is known to exist.

He was the second son of [[barber-surgeon]] Rodrigo de Cervantes and his wife, Leonor de Cortinas (ca 1520\u20131593).{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=35}} Rodrigo came from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], where his father Juan de Cervantes was an influential lawyer.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=32}} \n\nRodrigo was frequently in debt, or searching for work, and moved constantly. Leonor came from [[Arganda del Rey]], and died in October 1593, at the age of 73; surviving legal documents indicate she had seven children, could read and write, and was a resourceful individual with an eye for business. When Rodrigo was imprisoned for debt from October 1553 to April 1554, she supported the family on her own.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=34}}     \n\nCervantes' siblings were Andr\u00e9s (born 1543), Andrea (born 1544), Luisa (born 1546), Rodrigo (born 1550), Magdalena (born 1554) and Juan. They lived in C\u00f3rdoba until 1556, when his grandfather died; for reasons that are unclear, Rodrigo did not benefit from his will, and the family disappears until 1564, when he filed a lawsuit in [[Seville]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=36}}\n\nSeville was then in the midst of an economic boom, and Rodrigo managed rented accommodation for his elder brother Andres, who was a junior magistrate. It is assumed Cervantes attended the Jesuit college in Seville, where one of the teachers was Jesuit playwright Pedro Pablo Acevedo, who moved there in 1561 from C\u00f3rdoba.{{sfn|Egginton|2016|p=23}} However, legal records show his father got into debt once more, and in 1566, the family moved to [[Madrid]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===1566 to 1580; Military service and captivity===\n[[File:Cervantes Burgos.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Bust of Cervantes erected in 1905, [[Burgos]].]]\nIn the 19th century, a biographer discovered an arrest warrant for a Miguel de Cervantes, dated 15 September 1569, who was charged with wounding Antonio de Sigura in a duel.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=48}} Although disputed at the time, largely on the grounds such behaviour was unworthy of so great an author, it is now accepted as the most likely reason for Cervantes leaving Madrid.{{sfn|Lokos|2016|p=118}}\n\nHe eventually made his way to Rome, where he found a position in the household of Giulio Acquaviva, an Italian bishop who spent 1568 to 1569 in Madrid, and was appointed [[Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)|Cardinal]] in 1570.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=50}} When the 1570 to 1573 [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian_War_(1570\u20131573)|Ottoman\u2013Venetian War]] began, Spain formed part of the [[Holy_League_(1571)|Holy League]], a coalition formed to support the [[Republic_of_Venice|Venetian Republic]].

At some point, he was joined in Naples by his younger brother Rodrigo.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=52}} In September 1571, Cervantes sailed on board the ''Marquesa'', part of the Holy League fleet under Don [[John of Austria]], illegitimate half brother of [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II of Spain]]; on 7 October, they defeated the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto]].{{sfn|Davis|1999|p=199}} \n\nAccording to his own account, although suffering from malaria, Cervantes was given command of a 12-man [[skiff]], small boats used for assaulting enemy galleys. The ''Marquesa'' lost 40 dead, and 120 wounded, including Cervantes, who received three separate wounds, two in the chest, and another that rendered his left arm useless. His actions at Lepanto were a source of pride to the end of his life,{{efn|In the Preface to Volume 2 of ''Don Quixote'', he writes ''the loss of my hand (came about) on the grandest occasion the past or present has seen, or the future can hope to see.

Here he met Catalina de Salazar y Palacios (ca 1560?\u20131626), eldest daughter of the widowed Catalina de Palacios; her husband died leaving only debts, but the elder Catalina owned some land of her own.

Such positions were unpaid, and assumed the holder lived on what they kept, which meant a degree of 'corruption' was expected. They were also subject to price fluctuations, which could go either way; he was briefly jailed several times for 'irregularities', but quickly released. Several applications for positions in [[New_Spain|Spanish America]] were rejected, although modern critics note images of the colonies appear in his work.{{sfn|Ma|2017|p=99}} \n\nFrom 1596 to 1600, he lived primarily in Seville, then returned to Madrid in 1606, where he remained for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Close|2008|p=12}} In later years, he received some financial support from the [[Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro y Andrade|Count of Lemos]], although he was excluded from the retinue Lemos took to Naples when appointed [[List_of_viceroys_of_Naples|Viceroy]] in 1608.{{sfn|Ma|2017|p=99}} In July 1613, he joined the [[Secular Franciscan Order|Third Order Franciscan]], then a common way for Catholics to gain spiritual merit.{{sfn|Fitzmaurice-Kelly|1892|p=179}} It is generally accepted Cervantes died on 16 April 1616; the symptoms described, including intense thirst, correspond to [[diabetes]], then untreatable.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=264}} \n\nIn accordance with his will, Cervantes was buried in the [[Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians]], in central Madrid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Ca-Ch/Cervantes-Miguel-de.html |title=Miguel de Cervantes Biography \u2013 life, family, children, name, story, death, history, wife, son, book |publisher=Notablebiographies.com |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref> His remains went missing when moved during rebuilding work at the convent in 1673, and in 2014, historian [[Fernando de Prado]] launched a project to rediscover them.<ref>{{cite web|author=Giles Tremlett in Madrid |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/25/cervantes-bones-madrid-convent-search |title=Madrid begins search for bones of Don Quixote author Miguel de Cervantes &#124; Books |work=The Guardian |accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2015, Francisco Etxeberria, the [[forensic anthropologist]] leading the search, reported the discovery of caskets containing bone fragments, and part of a board, with the letters 'M.C.'.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Agence France-Presse |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/27/casket-find-could-lead-to-remains-of-don-quixote-author-miguel-de-cervantes |title=Casket find could lead to remains of Don Quixote author Miguel de Cervantes &#124; Books |work=The Guardian |accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> Based on evidence of injuries suffered at Lepanto, on 17 March 2015, they were confirmed as belonging to Cervantes, along with his wife and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31852032 |title=Spain finds Don Quixote writer Cervantes' tomb in Madrid |publisher=BBC |accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> They were formally reburied at a public ceremony in June 2015.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ciaran |last=Giles |date=11 June 2015 |title=Spain formally buries Cervantes, 400 years later |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2ab3c6f5e8684cada0ce22819ecccc36/spain-gives-formal-burial-cervantes-400-years-later |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Literary career and legacy==\n[[File:Don Quijote Illustration by Gustave Dore VII.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Illustration from ''Don Quijote'' by Gustave Dor\u00e9, with the windmill scene]]\nCervantes claims to have written over 20 plays, of which only two survive, ''El trato de Argel'', based on his experiences in captivity, and ''El cerco de Numancia''. Such works were extremely short-lived, and even [[Lope de Vega]], the best-known playwright of the day, could not live on their proceeds.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=112}} In 1585, he published ''La Galatea'', a conventional [[Pastoral]] romance that received little contemporary notice; despite promising to write a sequel, he never did so.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nAside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In ''Don Quixote'', he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' [[chivalric romance]]s.{{sfn|Close|2008|p=39}} His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular. First published in January 1605, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza featured in masquerades held to celebrate the birth of [[Philip_IV_of_Spain|Philip IV]] on 8 April.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=206}} \n[[File:Don Quijote illustrated by Gustav Dore V.jpg|thumb|upright|right|An illustration from ''Don Quijote'', by Gustave Dor\u00e9]]\nHe finally achieved a degree of financial security, while its popularity led to demands for a sequel. In the foreword to his 1613 work, ''Novelas ejemplares'', dedicated to his patron, the Count of Lemos, Cervantes promises to produce one, but was pre-empted by an unauthorised version published in 1614, published under the name [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda]]. It is possible this delay was deliberate, to ensure support from his publisher and reading public; Cervantes finally produced the second part of ''Don Quixote'' in 1615.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=234\u2013235}}\n\nThe two parts of ''Don Quixote'' are different in focus, but similar in their clarity of prose, and realism; the first was more comic, and had greater popular appeal.{{sfn|Mitsuo|2006|pp=148\u2013152}} The second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex, with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight.{{sfn|Putnam|1976|p=14}}  \n\nIn addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled ''Exemplary Novels'', similar in style to [[picaresque novel]]s written by [[Lazarillo de Tormes]]. This was followed by ''Viaje del Parnaso'', or ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'', and ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.\n\nHe was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century; literary editor [[John Bowle (writer)|John Bowle]] argued Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure.{{sfn|Truman|2003|pp=9\u201331}} However, ''Don Quixote'' has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author [[Carlos Fuentes]] suggested Cervantes and his contemporary [[William Shakespeare]] form part of a narrative tradition, which includes [[Homer]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], and [[James Joyce|Joyce]].{{sfn|Fuentes|1988|p=69\u201370}} \n\n[[Sigmund Freud]] claimed he learnt Spanish to read Cervantes in the original; he particularly admired ''El coloquio de los perros'', or ''[[The_Dialogue_of_the_Dogs|Dialogue of the Dogs]]'', from ''Exemplary Tales''. Two dogs, Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza, share their stories; as one talks, the other listens, occasionally making comments. From 1871 to 1881, he and his close friend, Eduard Silberstein, wrote letters to each other, using Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza.{{sfn |Riley |1994|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nThe tricentennial of ''Don Quixote'''s publication in 1905 was marked with celebrations in Spain; the 400th anniversary of his death in 2016, saw the production of ''Cervantina'', a celebration of his plays by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Nacional de Teatro Cl\u00e1sico in Madrid. The [[Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes]], the largest [[digital archive]] of Spanish-language historical and literary works in the world, is named after the author.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n[[File:La Galatea First Edition Title Page.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cervantes' ''La Galatea'' (1585), original title page.]]\n*''[[La Galatea]]'' (1585); \n*''El ingenioso hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha'' (1605): First volume of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.\n* ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'' (1613): a collection of 12 short stories of varied types about the social, political, and historical problems of Cervantes' Spain:\n** \"[[La gitanilla]]\" (\"The Gypsy Girl\")\n** \"El amante liberal\" (\"The Generous Lover\")\n** \"Rinconete y Cortadillo\" (\"Rinconete & Cortadillo\")\n** \"La espa\u00f1ola inglesa\" (\"The English Spanish Lady\")\n** \"[[El licenciado Vidriera]]\" (\"The Lawyer of Glass\")\n** \"La fuerza de la sangre\" (\"The Power of Blood\")\n** \"[[El celoso extreme\u00f1o]]\" (\"The Jealous Man From Extremadura\")<ref name=\"Br\"/>\n** \"La ilustre fregona\" (\"The Illustrious Kitchen-Maid\")\n** \"Novela de las dos doncellas\" (\"The Novel of the Two Damsels\")\n** \"Novela de la se\u00f1ora Cornelia\" (\"The Novel of Lady Cornelia\")\n** \"Novela del casamiento enga\u00f1oso\" (\"The Novel of the Deceitful Marriage\")\n** \"[[El coloquio de los perros]]\" (\"The Dialogue of the Dogs\")\n* ''Segunda Parte del Ingenioso Cavallero [sic] Don Quixote de la Mancha'' (1615): Second volume of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.\n* ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'' (1617).\n\n==Other works==\n[[File:Viaje del Parnaso.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Frontispiece of the ''Viaje'' (1614)]]\nGenerally considered a mediocre poet, few survive; some appear in ''[[La Galatea]]'', while he also wrote ''Dos Canciones \u00e0 la Armada Invencible''. \n\nHis [[sonnets]] are considered his best work, particularly ''Al T\u00famulo del Rey Felipe en Sevilla'', ''Canto de Cal\u00edope'' and ''Ep\u00edstola a Mateo V\u00e1zquez''.

The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Television]], with the service advertising content from Disney's [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]], [[National Geographic Partners|National Geographic]], [[Pixar]], and ''[[Lucasfilm|Star Wars]]'' brands in particular. [[List of original films distributed by Disney+|Original films]] and [[List of original programs distributed by Disney+|television series]] are also distributed on Disney+, with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform {{As of|2019|11|lc=y}}. Serving adjacent to Disney's other streaming platforms \u2013 the general programming-oriented [[Hulu]] and the sports-oriented [[ESPN+]] \u2013 Disney+ focuses on family-oriented entertainment.\nDisney+ relies on technology developed by [[Disney Streaming Services]], originally established as BAMTech in 2015, when it was spun off from [[MLB Advanced Media]] (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructure in anticipation of Disney's [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of 21st Century Fox]]. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with [[Netflix]] ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows to feature exclusively on the platform began in late 2017; [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel's original series for Netflix]] were cancelled in favor of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Disney+ series|Marvel Cinematic Universe series for Disney+]]. Disney+ is geared towards family-oriented entertainment.\n\nDisney+ debuted on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands. The service was expanded to Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico a week later, and expanded to select European countries in March 2020. It became available in India in April through Disney's [[Hotstar]] streaming service which was rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar. Further expansions are planned for Europe and Latin America in mid 2020 through 2021, as Disney's existing international streaming distribution deals with competing services expire. Upon launch, the service was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to movies and TV shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users subscribed to Disney+ within its first day of operation, and the service has 50 million subscribers {{as of|2020|04|lc=y}}.\n\n==History==\nIn August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in [[BAMTech]] (a [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[MLB Advanced Media]]'s streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. Following the purchase, [[ESPN]] announced plans for an \"exploratory [over-the-top] project\" based on its technology ([[ESPN+]]) to supplant its existing linear television services.<ref name=\"variety-disneybam\">{{Cite news |last=Spangler |first=Todd |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |title=What's Behind Disney's $1 Billion Investment in Major League Baseball's Digital Arm |date=August 18, 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=December 18, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220192059/http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |archive-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Daniel |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |title=Walt Disney Co. buys stake in video streaming service BAMTech |date=August 9, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817040954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |archive-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> On August 8, 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech for $1.58 billion, increasing its stake to 75%.

The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Television]], with the service advertising content from Disney's [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]], [[National Geographic Partners|National Geographic]], [[Pixar]], and ''[[Lucasfilm|Star Wars]]'' brands in particular. [[List of original films distributed by Disney+|Original films]] and [[List of original programs distributed by Disney+|television series]] are also distributed on Disney+, with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform {{As of|2019|11|lc=y}}. Serving adjacent to Disney's other streaming platforms \u2013 the general programming-oriented [[Hulu]] and the sports-oriented [[ESPN+]] \u2013 Disney+ focuses on family-oriented entertainment.\nDisney+ relies on technology developed by [[Disney Streaming Services]], originally established as BAMTech in 2015, when it was spun off from [[MLB Advanced Media]] (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructure in anticipation of Disney's [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of 21st Century Fox]]. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with [[Netflix]] ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows to feature exclusively on the platform began in late 2017; [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel's original series for Netflix]] were cancelled in favor of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Disney+ series|Marvel Cinematic Universe series for Disney+]].\n\nDisney+ debuted on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands. The service was expanded to Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico a week later, and expanded to select European countries in March 2020. It became available in India in April through Disney's [[Hotstar]] streaming service which was rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar. Further expansions are planned for Europe and Latin America in mid 2020 through 2021, as Disney's existing international streaming distribution deals with competing services expire. Upon launch, the service was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to movies and TV shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users subscribed to Disney+ within its first day of operation, and the service has 50 million subscribers {{as of|2020|04|lc=y}}.\n\n==History==\nIn August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in [[BAMTech]] (a [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[MLB Advanced Media]]'s streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. Following the purchase, [[ESPN]] announced plans for an \"exploratory [over-the-top] project\" based on its technology ([[ESPN+]]) to supplant its existing linear television services.<ref name=\"variety-disneybam\">{{Cite news |last=Spangler |first=Todd |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |title=What's Behind Disney's $1 Billion Investment in Major League Baseball's Digital Arm |date=August 18, 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=December 18, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220192059/http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |archive-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Daniel |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |title=Walt Disney Co. buys stake in video streaming service BAMTech |date=August 9, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817040954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |archive-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> On August 8, 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech for $1.58 billion, increasing its stake to 75%.

The game was announced at [[E3 2013]] and released worldwide in May 2014.\n\nLike in other games in the series, in ''Mario Kart 8'', players control characters from the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]] and participate in [[kart racing]] on various [[race track]]s, using a variety of [[Item (gaming)|items]] to hinder opponents or gain advantages in the race. While incorporating [[game mechanics]] originally featured in earlier ''Mario Kart'' games, ''Mario Kart 8'' introduces [[anti-gravity]] sections that allow players to drive on walls or ceilings, in addition to allowing them to bump into one another for a short boost. The game features [[single-player]] and [[multiplayer]] gamemodes, including online via the [[Nintendo Network]].\n\n''Mario Kart 8'' was a critical and commercial success upon its release, and is the [[List of best-selling Wii U video games|best-selling Wii U game]], with more than eight million copies sold worldwide. The game continued to receive post-release [[Patch (computing)|patches]] and [[downloadable content]], including additional characters, vehicles and tracks, and support for Nintendo's [[Amiibo]] line of figurines. An enhanced port for the [[Nintendo Switch]], '''''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe''''', was released worldwide in April 2017. It was also a critical and commercial success, selling over 22 million copies worldwide by December 2019, ranking it the Switch's [[List of best-selling Nintendo Switch video games|best-selling game]]. Across both platforms, ''Mario Kart 8'' has sold over 31 million copies, making it one of the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling video games of all time]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:MK8 Mario Circuit.jpg|thumb|left|Anti-gravity racing introduced in ''Mario Kart 8'']]\n{{see also|Mario Kart#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay in the Mario Kart series|Characters in the Mario Kart series}}\nThe game continues the traditional gameplay of the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series, in which characters from the ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' universe race against each other in [[go-kart]]s, attempting to hinder their opponents or improve their racing performance using various tools found in item boxes. In addition, the game includes four different difficulties, which can be selected before beginning the race to challenge players. Returning features from previous installments include [[motorbike]]s and twelve-player racing from ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'', as well as [[hang glider]]s, underwater racing and vehicle customization from ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''.\n\n''Mario Kart 8''{{'}}s new features include [[anti-gravity]] racing, in which certain parts of a track can allow racers to drive on walls and ceilings.<ref name=\"MK8 at Engadget\"/> During these sections, players can bump into other racers or special bumpers to trigger a Spin Boost, which gives them an extra speed boost. New characters include The Koopalings and Pink Gold [[Princess Peach|Peach]]. There are four new items: the [[Boomerang]] Flower, which can be thrown to attack players, the Piranha Plant, which attacks nearby racers and obstacles, the Crazy Eight, which gives the user eight items, and the Super Horn, which can be used both to attack nearby opponents and defend against items, including the previously nearly unavoidable [[Blue shell|Spiny Shell]].<ref name=\"Mario Kart 8 Direct April 30, 2014\"/><ref name=\"Mario Kart 8 - More New Features Trailer\"/> The game features 32 tracks in eight cups (Mushroom, Flower, Star, Special, Shell, Banana, Leaf, and Lightning), with an additional 16 later released as [[downloadable content]] (DLC) in four additional cups: Egg, [[Triforce]], Crossing, and Bell.\n\nAlong with local multiplayer, ''Mario Kart 8'' supports online multiplayer with up to twelve players and [[Voice chat in online gaming|voice chat]] outside of races, however voice chat is only available with friends online. Prior to the cancellation of Nintendo's [[Nintendo Network#Miiverse|Miiverse]] social network on November 7, 2017, players could set up tournaments with customizable rules and schedules, share races automatically recorded in-game to the online video platform [[YouTube]], and receive in-game [[Postage stamp|stamps]] for use on Miiverse by beating staff times and completing [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] races. Due to the cancellation of Miiverse, these features have been removed from the game, although downloading [[Glossary of video game terms#Ghost|ghost]] data from friends or top players is still possible. <!-- Can this be confirmed? -->\n\nThe Wii U version of the game is compatible with the [[Wii U GamePad]], [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]], [[Wii U Pro Controller]], [[Classic Controller|Wii Classic Controller]] and [[Wii Remote#Wii Wheel|Wii Wheel]],<ref name=\"Direct\" /> while the Nintendo Switch version can be played with an individual [[Joy-Con]] turned on its side, the Joy-Con Grip controller shell, the console tablet with both Joy-Con attached, or the [[Nintendo Switch#Other controllers and accessories|Nintendo Switch Pro Controller]].

The first update, released in August 2014, includes rearranged post-race options, an optional course map on the game screen, a player statistics screen, and improved online stability.<ref name=\"IGN-Update1\" /> The second update, released in November 2014 adds support for Nintendo's [[Amiibo]] figures, allowing players to unlock Mii racing outfits based on other Nintendo characters.<ref name=\"Amiibo at TheVerge\" /> The third update, released in April 2015, added a new 200cc class, a first for the series, and additional racing suits unlockable via Amiibo.\n\nAdditional characters and tracks for the game have been released as [[downloadable content]].

The first DLC pack, released in November 2014, features Tanooki Mario, Cat Peach and [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] as playable characters, while the second pack, released in April 2015, features Dry Bowser, Villager and [[Isabelle (Animal Crossing)|Isabelle]].

[[Wii U]] home video game console. The game was announced at [[E3 2013]] and released worldwide in May 2014.\n\nLike in other games in the series, in ''Mario Kart 8'', players control characters from the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]] and participate in [[kart racing]] on various [[race track]]s, using a variety of [[Item (gaming)|items]] to hinder opponents or gain advantages in the race. While incorporating [[game mechanics]] originally featured in earlier ''Mario Kart'' games, ''Mario Kart 8'' introduces [[anti-gravity]] sections that allow players to drive on walls or ceilings, in addition to allowing them to bump into one another for a short boost. The game features [[single-player]] and [[multiplayer]] gamemodes, including online via the [[Nintendo Network]].\n\n''Mario Kart 8'' was a critical and commercial success upon its release, and is the [[List of best-selling Wii U video games|best-selling Wii U game]], with more than eight million copies sold worldwide. The game continued to receive post-release [[Patch (computing)|patches]] and [[downloadable content]], including additional characters, vehicles and tracks, and support for Nintendo's [[Amiibo]] line of figurines. An enhanced port for the [[Nintendo Switch]], '''''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe''''', was released worldwide in April 2017. It was also a critical and commercial success, selling over 22 million copies worldwide by December 2019, ranking it the Switch's [[List of best-selling Nintendo Switch video games|best-selling game]]. Across both platforms, ''Mario Kart 8'' has sold over 31 million copies, making it one of the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling video games of all time]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:MK8 Mario Circuit.jpg|thumb|left|Anti-gravity racing introduced in ''Mario Kart 8'']]\n{{see also|Mario Kart#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay in the Mario Kart series|Characters in the Mario Kart series}}\nThe game continues the traditional gameplay of the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series, in which characters from the ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' universe race against each other in [[go-kart]]s, attempting to hinder their opponents or improve their racing performance using various tools found in item boxes. In addition, the game includes four different difficulties, which can be selected before beginning the race to challenge players. Returning features from previous installments include [[motorbike]]s and twelve-player racing from ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'', as well as [[hang glider]]s, underwater racing and vehicle customization from ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''.\n\n''Mario Kart 8''{{'}}s new features include [[anti-gravity]] racing, in which certain parts of a track can allow racers to drive on walls and ceilings.<ref name=\"MK8 at Engadget\"/> During these sections, players can bump into other racers or special bumpers to trigger a Spin Boost, which gives them an extra speed boost. New characters include The Koopalings and Pink Gold [[Princess Peach|Peach]]. There are four new items: the [[Boomerang]] Flower, which can be thrown to attack players, the Piranha Plant, which attacks nearby racers and obstacles, the Crazy Eight, which gives the user eight items, and the Super Horn, which can be used both to attack nearby opponents and defend against items, including the previously nearly unavoidable [[Blue shell|Spiny Shell]].<ref name=\"Mario Kart 8 Direct April 30, 2014\"/><ref name=\"Mario Kart 8 - More New Features Trailer\"/> The game features 32 tracks in eight cups (Mushroom, Flower, Star, Special, Shell, Banana, Leaf, and Lightning), with an additional 16 later released as [[downloadable content]] (DLC) in four additional cups: Egg, [[Triforce]], Crossing, and Bell.\n\nAlong with local multiplayer, ''Mario Kart 8'' supports online multiplayer with up to twelve players and [[Voice chat in online gaming|voice chat]] outside of races, however voice chat is only available with friends online. Prior to the cancellation of Nintendo's [[Nintendo Network#Miiverse|Miiverse]] social network on November 7, 2017, players could set up tournaments with customizable rules and schedules, share races automatically recorded in-game to the online video platform [[YouTube]], and receive in-game [[Postage stamp|stamps]] for use on Miiverse by beating staff times and completing [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] races. Due to the cancellation of Miiverse, these features have been removed from the game, although downloading [[Glossary of video game terms#Ghost|ghost]] data from friends or top players is still possible. <!-- Can this be confirmed? -->\n\nThe Wii U version of the game is compatible with the [[Wii U GamePad]], [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]], [[Wii U Pro Controller]], [[Classic Controller|Wii Classic Controller]] and [[Wii Remote#Wii Wheel|Wii Wheel]],<ref name=\"Direct\" /> while the Nintendo Switch version can be played with an individual [[Joy-Con]] turned on its side, the Joy-Con Grip controller shell, the console tablet with both Joy-Con attached, or the [[Nintendo Switch#Other controllers and accessories|Nintendo Switch Pro Controller]]. Players can use [[Amiibo]] figures to unlock Nintendo-themed costumes that can be worn by [[Mii]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/11/05/mario-kart-8s-first-dlc-pack-will-add-mute-city-f-zero-zelda-themed-course/|title=Mario Kart 8's First DLC Pack Will Add Mute City From F-Zero, Zelda-Themed Course|date=November 5, 2014}}</ref> A free software update to the Nintendo Switch version was made in June 2018 that allows players to use the Toy-Con Motorbike from the [[Nintendo Labo]] Variety Kit as a compatible motion controller.<ref name=\"labo\">{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-now-supports-nintendo-labo-1827121784|title=Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Now Supports Nintendo Labo|last=Plunkett|first=Luke|date=June 25, 2018|work=Kotaku|access-date=June 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\nInitially confirmed in a January 2013 [[List of Nintendo Direct presentations|Nintendo Direct]] presentation, the game was later unveiled at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013|E3 2013]]. Some members of [[Bandai Namco Games]] were given special thanks in the game's credits.<ref name=\"Bandai MK8\"/> The \"8\" in the game's logo was designed to resemble a [[M\u00f6bius strip]], as was Mario Circuit, one of the tracks in the game.<ref name=\"Direct\" /> Early in development, the idea of using a drill to penetrate the ground was considered but was quickly discarded for not being as creative as anti-gravity.<ref name=\"Hideki Konno, MK8, MTV interview\"/>\n\nNew features and enhancements are added via game updates. The first update, released in August 2014, includes rearranged post-race options, an optional course map on the game screen, a player statistics screen, and improved online stability.<ref name=\"IGN-Update1\" /> The second update, released in November 2014 adds support for Nintendo's [[Amiibo]] figures, allowing players to unlock Mii racing outfits based on other Nintendo characters.<ref name=\"Amiibo at TheVerge\" /> The third update, released in April 2015, added a new 200cc class, a first for the series, and additional racing suits unlockable via Amiibo.\n\nAdditional characters and tracks for the game have been released as [[downloadable content]]. The first is a free set of [[Mercedes-Benz]]-themed vehicles: the [[Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class|2014 Mercedes-Benz GLA]], [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SL|1957 SL 300 Roadster]], and [[Mercedes-Benz W25|1934 W25 Silver Arrow]], which were released on August 27, 2014 as part of the Version 2.0 update.<ref name=\"IGN-Update1\" /> On August 26, 2014, Nintendo announced two purchasable DLC packs, with each pack containing three additional characters, four additional vehicles and eight additional tracks; [[Crossover (fiction)|some of which are based on other Nintendo franchises]], including ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' (Hyrule Circuit), ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', ''[[F-Zero]]'' (Mute City and Big Blue) and ''[[Excitebike]]'' (Excitebike Arena). The first DLC pack, released in November 2014, features Tanooki Mario, Cat Peach and [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] as playable characters, while the second pack, released in April 2015, features Dry Bowser, Villager and [[Isabelle (Animal Crossing)|Isabelle]]. Additional multi-colored [[Yoshi]]s and Shy Guys are given to players who purchase both DLC packs.<ref name=\"Franchises coming to MK8\" /><ref name=\"Yoshi different color\" />\n\n== Promotion ==\nNintendo's launch promotions of ''Mario Kart 8'' included a Limited Edition, which included a Spiny Shell figurine, and special [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] themed console bundles, which included a hat, strategy guide, Wii Remote Plus controller, Wii Wheel and GamePad protector.<ref name=\"MK8 bundles at MCVUK\"/> In North America, Europe, and Australia, players who purchased and registered
