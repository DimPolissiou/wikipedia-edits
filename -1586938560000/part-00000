''Tung'' means ''east'' in [[Cantonese]], while ''Sai'' means ''west''. At that time, merchandising ships sailed east to the village and west to [[Macau]].\n\nTung Chung may be a new town, but its heritage can be seen in the form of old fishing villages. They show another fa\u00e7ade of Tung Chung, of a village before the development of the airport and the town.\n\n=== New town development ===\nIn the 1990s, Tung Chung was developed as a [[New towns of Hong Kong|new town]]. This was undertaken as part of the [[Airport Core Programme]], a package of development and infrastructure projects surrounding the relocation of [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong's international airport]] from [[Kai Tak Airport|Kai Tak]] to [[Chek Lap Kok]], adjacent to Tung Chung. Tung Chung New Town was intended to serve as a supporting community for the new airport.<ref name=\"napcotungchungph1\">{{cite web|title=Tung Chung New Town (Phase 1)|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/archive/napco/p-tung.html|website=Hong Kong Airport Core Programme|publisher=New Airport Projects Co-ordination Office|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the information from the Hong Kong [[Territory Development Department]], Tung Chung is being developed in four phases into a new town with a target population of 250,000 people. The first phase was completed in 1994; infrastructure works was completed in January 1997 in order to tie with the subsequent completion of the first housing developments. This phase of development provided about 20,000 people in the district to support the airport at [[Chek Lap Kok]].\n\nPhase 2 of Tung Chung development was also completed. About 350,000 square metres of [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|land was reclaimed]] east of the Phase 1 development area. Roads and drainage works to serve this reclaimed land were completed in May 2000. Land formation of 270,000 m<sup>2</sup> for the remaining Phase 2 areas south of [[Tung Chung Bay]] together with the associated infrastructure were completed in February 2001. Upon completion, Phase 2 development will accommodate a population of 67,000.\n\nReclamation works under Phase 3A development commenced in March 1999 and were completed in April 2003. About 260,000 m<sup>2</sup> of land was reclaimed north-east of Phase I development area. The reclamation will provide land for housing developments to accommodate a population of about 22,000.\n\nThe remaining development in Tung Chung is planned to be implemented as Phases 3 and 4 and to be completed in a foreseeable future.\n\nCurrently, Tung Chung is primarily residential, but an office block and hotel have already been completed. It is envisaged that in the future, other commercial projects will be developed in Tung Chung to support the growing population.\n\n==Housing==\n[[Image:Caribbean Square Bermuda Park 2016.jpg|thumb|right|Private housing estates in Tung Chung New Town]]\n[[File:Yat Tung Estate 1.jpg|thumb|Yat Tung Estate viewed across [[Tung Chung Bay]], with [[Sunset Peak (Hong Kong)|Sunset Peak]] in the background]]\nTung Chung New Town (Phase 1) is the newly developed core living area around Tung Chung. The development is one of the ten parts of the Hong Kong Airport Core Programme.<ref name=\"napcotungchungph1\"/> The first phase of [[public housing in Hong Kong|public housing development]] was completed in late 1997 and can accommodate up to 15,000 people. Another 5,000 people are housed in the private housing development completed in 1998.\n\n===Private housing estates===\n'''Tung Chung Crescent''' is the MTR Tung Chung Station Development Package One together with Seaview Crescent and Citygate. It is the first private residential estate completed in Tung Chung. It is jointly developed by five local developers including Hang Lung Development Co. Ltd., [[Henderson Land Development Co. Ltd.]], [[New World Development Co. Ltd.]], [[Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd.]], [[Swire Properties]] and with the [[MTR Corporation]].\n\n'''Seaview Crescent''', developed by the same developers as Tung Chung Crescent, consists of four tower blocks in the same style of Tung Chung Crescent, though these face the sea and the airport at Chek Lap Kok.\n\n'''Coastal Skyline''' is the MTR Tung Chung Station Development Package Two. It was jointly developed by [[HKR International Limited]], Hong Leong Holdings Limited and Reco Tung Chung Pte Ltd. and MTR Corporation and consisting of seven residential towers of around 50 stories each, and a number of low-rise flats.\n\n'''Caribbean Coast''' is the MTR Tung Chung Station Development Package Three. It was jointly developed by [[Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited]], [[Hutchison Whampoa Limited]] and the MTR Corporation. It is about 67,900 m<sup>2</sup> with both residential and commercial buildings.\n\n===Public housing estates===\n{{see also|Public housing estates on Lantau Island}}\nPublic (government) housing and [[Home Ownership Scheme]] flats also make up a sizeable part of Tung Chung. The first phase of public housing development including five homeownership blocks at Yu Tung Court and three public rental housing blocks at Fu Tung Estate comprising 2,640 homeownership and 1,664 rental units. [[Yat Tung Estate]] is a newer integrated development consisting of twenty 40-story tower blocks towards the south of the town center, near the fishing village in [[Tung Chung Bay]], complete with kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, shopping mall, car park, and transport interchange. [[Public housing estates on Lantau Island # Ying Tung Estate|Ying Tung Estate]] was built in 2018 near Ying Tung Road, which consists of four blocks: Ying Chui House, Ying Yuet House, Ying Hei House and Ying Fuk House.\n\n==Shopping and dining==\n[[File: Citygate Bridge Corridor 201308.jpg|thumb|Citygate shopping center]]\nTung Chung Town Centre features a number of shops, restaurants, a cinema and entertainment facilities centered on the [[Citygate]] development; as well as transportation to [[Kowloon]] or [[Hong Kong Island]]. The Tung Chung Citygate Outlets have many factory outlets of high-end brands and other brands as well as offering huge discounts.\nFu Tung Shopping Centre, Yat Tung Shopping Centre, and [[Citygate]]<ref>http://www.citygateoutlets.com.hk</ref> are the three shopping centres in Tung Chung thus far. Further shopping malls are expected at the new developments in '''Caribbean Coast'''. Tung Chung is 12 minutes from [[Tsing Yi]] and [[Kwai Tsing]], where a much wider variety of shopping options are available.\n\nCitygate Outlets is at the heart of this new town, developed in conjunction with the [[Tung Chung Station (MTR)|Tung Chung MTR Station]] and bus terminus, thus providing a focal point to the town. Citygate, developed in the glass and steel style of the Hong Kong International Airport, contains 500,000 square feet (46,000 m<sup>2</sup>) of shopping, entertainment, and food outlets spread across five floors. A square outside the mall contains a special fountain which performs a musical show regularly.\n\n'''Yat Tung''' is a newer development; the first and second phase was completed in March 2001 and May 2002 respectively. It provides supermarkets, services, and a number of eating outlets.\n\nBoth Asian and Western cuisines are available at the many restaurants in Tung Chung, including Chinese, Vietnamese, Italian, American, Thai, Japanese, and Korean.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} It is also possible to have a meal at a temple behind the [[Tung Chung Battery]] and at a restaurant in [[Po Lin Monastery]] which serves vegetarian food.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\nNear the [[Ngong Ping 360|Ngong Ping cable car]] terminal, there are restaurants and bars offering Asian and European dishes.\n\n==Sights and attractions==\n\n===Tung Chung Fort===\n[[File:Tung chung fort.jpg|frame|Tung Chung Fort, Lantau, Hong Kong]]\n[[Tung Chung Fort]] was built in 1817, when the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Government was alarmed by the rampant [[pirate|piracy]] of [[Cheung Po Tsai]] (though Cheung himself had been captured seven years earlier) and decided to intervene and thwart the [[opium trade]] and defend the coast from pirates. The Fort was [[Declared monuments of Hong Kong|declared a monument]] in 1979. There are 6 old muzzle-loading cannons (still intact), each resting on a cement base and the enclosures are made of [[granite]] blocks, measuring 70 by 80 meters. Three arched gateways, each engraved with a Chinese inscription, are spaced along the walls. Tung Chung Fort itself went through several transformations. It was first used as a police station and then as a secondary school. Now, it is the base for the Rural Committee Office and the Tung Chung Public School.\n\n===Hau Wong Temple===\n[[Image: Hau Wong Temple, Tung Chung.jpg|thumb|Hau Wong Temple]]\n[[Hau Wong Temple]], a tiered-roof structure built in 1765, is dedicated to [[Yeung Hau]], a loyal court official of the [[Song Dynasty]] who died with [[Emperor Bing of Song China|its last emperor]]. And this temple was a place for training soldiers in the Qing Dynasty. There is a stele founded in 1777, which is an important product of culture for researches about the Qing Dynasty. Recently renovated, the temple features lavish interior decorations. The temple is over 200 years old. The row of miniature human figures on the eaves looks still very real to life. On the 18th of the eighth month in the [[lunar calendar]] every year, there are activities such as [[Chinese opera]]s and gatherings in the open area of the temple, to celebrate the birthday of Hau Wong.\n\nThe temple is twenty minutes walking distance from the train station.\n\n===Tin Hau Temple===\nA [[Tin Hau Temple]] is located in [[Chek Lap Kok New Village]], Wong Lung Hang Road, Tung Chung. The temple was initially built in 1823 at the north east of [[Chek Lap Kok]]. It was dismantled in 1991 because of the construction of [[Hong Kong International Airport|the new airport]], and was rebuilt in 1994 at its present location.<ref>[http://www.islandsdc.gov.hk/index.php?action=sight&did=2&sid=8 Exploring Islands - Tung Chung] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BiSuxpGc?url=http://www.islandsdc.gov.hk/index.php?action=sight |date=27 October 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"1444 HB\">[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB_brief_info_en.pdf Antiquities and Monuments Offices - Introduction to 1444 Historic Buildings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013022841/http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB_brief_info_en.pdf |date=13 October 2012 }}</ref> It is a [[List of Grade I historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade I historic building]].<ref name=\"AMO\">[http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/historical.pdf List of Graded Historic Buildings in Hong Kong (as at 6 November 2009)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709224215/http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/historical.pdf |date=9 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Tung Chung Battery===\n[[File: Tung Chung Battery, 2013-09-08.jpg|thumb|Tung Chung Battery]]\n[[Tung Chung Battery]] was one of the two military forts built in 1817 at the foot of the [[Rocky Lion Hill]] at Tung Chung according to the Guangdong Annals. Its remains were discovered on a hill slope facing the sea near Tung Chung pier in 1980. An L-shaped wall with a platform at the corner, probably for gun emplacements, was revealed after clearing the dense undergrowth.\n\n===Lo Hon Temple===\n[[Lo Hon Monastery]], at [[Shek Mun Kap]]. Built by lay Buddhists in 1974, it occupies the site of a grotto named Lo Hon Cavern where a hermit from [[Guangdong]] practiced [[Buddhism]] in 1926.\n\n===Ngong Ping: Big Buddha, Po Lin Monastery and Ngong Ping 360===\n[[Image:Hong Kong Budha.jpg|thumb|200px|Big Buddha]]\n\nTung Chung serves as the gateway for those wishing to explore [[Ngong Ping]]'s [[Tian Tan Buddha|Big Buddha]], the world's largest seated outdoor bronze Buddha statue; and [[Po Lin Monastery]].\n\nNgong Ping can be reached by:\n* The [[Ngong Ping 360]] cable car\n* Buses from Tung Chung Town Centre; plying between Tung Chung and Ngong Ping via Tung Chung Road and South Lantau Highway\n* Hiking trail\n\n==Nature==\n[[File:Tung Chung River (Hong Kong).jpg|thumb|220px|Tung Chung River]]\nTung Chung is surrounded by two large [[Hong Kong Country Parks & Special Areas|country parks]], cover an area of Lantau Island as large as Hong Kong Island: The [[Lantau North Country Park|Lantau North]] and [[Lantau South Country Park|Lantau South]] Country Parks.\n\nThe presence of [[mangrove]]s and freshwater streams in Tung Chung provides excellent ecologically valuable habitats for freshwater fish species, [[dragonflies]] and rare [[amphibia]]ns.\n\nHowever, the reclamation and other civil engineering works in Tung Chung has heavily damaged these habitats and produced irreversible damage to native wildlife and the surrounding environment.\n\n===Tung Chung Valley===\nThe hiking route begins at [[Ngong Ping]], from the [[Tian Tan Buddha|Big Buddha]] follow signs for [[Lantau Peak]]. The total length is 8&nbsp; km. The route winds around the northern slopes of Lantau Peak and descends into Tung Chung Valley. The trail passes woodland, mountain streams and also hillside monasteries. The impressive views over [[Shek Pik]] make a strong contrast with the airport which is seen in the distance. Side paths skirt the small monasteries seen along the way. All around are natural hillsides, rich with life forms, some of them rare.\n\nTung Chung Valley is the home of some of the steepest and most primeval mountain streams in Hong Kong. The formation of spectacular [[waterfall]]s is facilitated in the presence of the sheer cliffs and deep gorges in the valley.\n\nAlmost all the streams in the area have their name related to ''Lung'' (the Chinese word for ''[[Chinese dragon|dragon]]'') which is the [[Chinese mythology|Chinese mythological creature]] of the waters and the favorite metaphor for the towering waterfalls.\n\nBeing the main branch of the Tung Chung Valley, the deep-set [[Wong Lung Valley]] is the home of the Wong Lung Stream (The Yellow Dragon). The mainstream has its source on the saddle at the east of [[Sunset Peak (Hong Kong)|Sunset Peak]], but the stream collects water through a large network of feeder streams on both sides of the valley, including the famous Tung-Lung, Pak-Lung, Chong-Lung, and Ngo-Lung Streams, which are known collectively as \"The Five Dragons of Tung Chung\".\n\n===Wong Lung Waterfall===\nWong Lung Waterfall is located in the [[Lantau North Country Park]]. It is named \"Wong-Lung\" since, during a heavy rainstorm, when we view from the high ground, the stream resembles a yellow dragon ready to take off for heaven when it and its feeders are flooded with torrential muddy water, with Wong-Lung as the trunk and the feeders its limbs.\n\n===Tung-Lung Stream===\nTung-Lung Stream spectacular stream that falls seemingly joined together by the torrential water to form continuous fals of more than 700 feet (213 m). Tung-Lung Stream is rich in varieties of rare local wild plants and animals, especially in the primeval forest at an upper stream, among them the unique Hong Kong [[newt]]s (''Paramesotriton hongkongensis'') as well as several species of wild [[orchid]]s.\n\n===Tung Chung Stream===\nTung Chung Stream is the only known Hong Kong site for the rare [[fish]], [[Acrossocheilus (Lissolichthys) wenchowensis beijiangensis]] (\u5317\u6c5f\u5149\u5507\u9b5a) and one of only two sites on Lantau where the locally rare [[crested kingfisher]], ''Megaceryle lugubris'', has been recorded.\n\n===Upper Tung Chung Valley===\nThe upper Tung Chung Valley is an important habitat for [[bird]]s, including thrushes and warblers (Hopkin, pers. comm.). Eagle owls, a species highly sensitive to a disturbance around their nesting sites, breed here (Wilson, pers. comm.). The locally rare [[Hainan blue flycatcher]] probably breeds here (Chalmers, pers. comm.). The largest population of the reptile [[tokay gecko]], ''Gekko gecko'', occurs in the cliffs and boulder crevices in upper Tung Chung Valley (Lau, pers. comm.).\n\nThe woods in the upper Tung Chung Valley are reported to be some of the best on Lantau for rare plant species and for butterflies, including the [[birdwing butterfly]] which breeds here (Reels, pers. comm.).\n\n===Hiking trails===\nHiking trails link Tung Chung to the fishing village of [[Tai O]]. This trail follows the north-western coast of Lantau Island; providing a view of the runway approach to Chek Lap Kok as well as a number of villages and local scenery.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} This, however is a strenuous four-hour trek.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAn easier and well-wooded walk with picnic and barbecue sites also link [[Shui Hau]] to Tung Chung Road. Turning south from Tung Chung Road, visitors can get to the [[Beaches of Hong Kong|Cheung Sha beaches]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Hong Kong Buddhist Youth Camp===\nLocated on a 4,877&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> site near Tung Chung, the Buddhist Youth Camp enables youth and families to share and experience life in a peaceful and natural environment.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}{{tone inline|date=January 2019}} Built in 1979 for HK$3 million, the camp is run by the [[Hong Kong Buddhist Association]].

Administratively, Tung Chung is part of [[Islands District]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==History==\n===Early times===\nSince the [[Song Dynasty]] between 960\u20131279 AD, there have been people living in Tung Chung. At that time, they lived on fishing and agriculture. Crabs, fishes and crops were their main productions.\n\nThis place was originally called ''Tung Sai Chung'', when Hong Kong was still a group of fishing villages. ''Tung'' means ''east'' in [[Cantonese]], while ''Sai'' means ''west''. At that time, merchandising ships sailed east to the village and west to [[Macau]].\n\nTung Chung may be a new town, but its heritage can be seen in the form of old fishing villages. They show another fa\u00e7ade of Tung Chung, of a village before the development of the airport and the town.\n\n=== New town development ===\nIn the 1990s, Tung Chung was developed as a [[New towns of Hong Kong|new town]]. This was undertaken as part of the [[Airport Core Programme]], a package of development and infrastructure projects surrounding the relocation of [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong's international airport]] from [[Kai Tak Airport|Kai Tak]] to [[Chek Lap Kok]], adjacent to Tung Chung. Tung Chung New Town was intended to serve as a supporting community for the new airport.<ref name=\"napcotungchungph1\">{{cite web|title=Tung Chung New Town (Phase 1)|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/archive/napco/p-tung.html|website=Hong Kong Airport Core Programme|publisher=New Airport Projects Co-ordination Office|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the information from the Hong Kong [[Territory Development Department]], Tung Chung is being developed in four phases into a new town with a target population of 250,000 people. The first phase was completed in 1994; infrastructure works was completed in January 1997 in order to tie with the subsequent completion of the first housing developments. This phase of development provided about 20,000 people in the district to support the airport at [[Chek Lap Kok]].\n\nPhase 2 of Tung Chung development was also completed. About 350,000 square metres of [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|land was reclaimed]] east of the Phase 1 development area. Roads and drainage works to serve this reclaimed land were completed in May 2000. Land formation of 270,000 m<sup>2</sup> for the remaining Phase 2 areas south of [[Tung Chung Bay]] together with the associated infrastructure were completed in February 2001. Upon completion, Phase 2 development will accommodate a population of 67,000.\n\nReclamation works under Phase 3A development commenced in March 1999 and were completed in April 2003. About 260,000 m<sup>2</sup> of land was reclaimed north-east of Phase I development area. The reclamation will provide land for housing developments to accommodate a population of about 22,000.\n\nThe remaining development in Tung Chung is planned to be implemented as Phases 3 and 4 and to be completed in a foreseeable future.\n\nCurrently, Tung Chung is primarily residential, but an office block and hotel have already been completed. It is envisaged that in the future, other commercial projects will be developed in Tung Chung to support the growing population.\n\n==Housing==\n[[Image:Caribbean Square Bermuda Park 2016.jpg|thumb|right|Private housing estates in Tung Chung New Town]]\n[[File:Yat Tung Estate 1.jpg|thumb|Yat Tung Estate viewed across [[Tung Chung Bay]], with [[Sunset Peak (Hong Kong)|Sunset Peak]] in the background]]\nTung Chung New Town (Phase 1) is the newly developed core living area around Tung Chung. The development is one of the ten parts of the Hong Kong Airport Core Programme.<ref name=\"napcotungchungph1\"/> The first phase of [[public housing in Hong Kong|public housing development]] was completed in late 1997 and can accommodate up to 15,000 people. Another 5,000 people are housed in the private housing development completed in 1998.\n\n===Private housing estates===\n'''Tung Chung Crescent''' is the MTR Tung Chung Station Development Package One together with Seaview Crescent and Citygate. It is the first private residential estate completed in Tung Chung. It is jointly developed by five local developers including Hang Lung Development Co. Ltd., [[Henderson Land Development Co. Ltd.]], [[New World Development Co. Ltd.]], [[Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd.]], [[Swire Properties]] and with the [[MTR Corporation]].\n\n'''Seaview Crescent''', developed by the same developers as Tung Chung Crescent, consists of four tower blocks in the same style of Tung Chung Crescent, though these face the sea and the airport at Chek Lap Kok.\n\n'''Coastal Skyline''' is the MTR Tung Chung Station Development Package Two. It was jointly developed by [[HKR International Limited]], Hong Leong Holdings Limited and Reco Tung Chung Pte Ltd. and MTR Corporation and consisting of seven residential towers of around 50 stories each, and a number of low-rise flats.\n\n'''Caribbean Coast''' is the MTR Tung Chung Station Development Package Three. It was jointly developed by [[Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited]], [[Hutchison Whampoa Limited]] and the MTR Corporation. It is about 67,900 m<sup>2</sup> with both residential and commercial buildings.\n\n===Public housing estates===\n{{see also|Public housing estates on Lantau Island}}\nPublic (government) housing and [[Home Ownership Scheme]] flats also make up a sizeable part of Tung Chung. The first phase of public housing development including five homeownership blocks at Yu Tung Court and three public rental housing blocks at Fu Tung Estate comprising 2,640 homeownership and 1,664 rental units. [[Yat Tung Estate]] is a newer integrated development consisting of twenty 40-story tower blocks towards the south of the town center, near the fishing village in [[Tung Chung Bay]], complete with kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, shopping mall, car park, and transport interchange. [[Public housing estates on Lantau Island # Ying Tung Estate|Ying Tung Estate]] was built in 2018 near Ying Tung Road, which consists of four blocks: Ying Chui House, Ying Yuet House, Ying Hei House and Ying Fuk House.\n\n==Shopping and dining==\n[[File: Citygate Bridge Corridor 201308.jpg|thumb|Citygate shopping center]]\nTung Chung Town Centre features a number of shops, restaurants, a cinema and entertainment facilities centered on the [[Citygate]] development; as well as transportation to [[Kowloon]] or [[Hong Kong Island]]. The Tung Chung Citygate Outlets have many factory outlets of high-end brands and other brands as well as offering huge discounts.\nFu Tung Shopping Centre, Yat Tung Shopping Centre, and [[Citygate]]<ref>http://www.citygateoutlets.com.hk</ref> are the three shopping centres in Tung Chung thus far. Further shopping malls are expected at the new developments in '''Caribbean Coast'''. Tung Chung is 12 minutes from [[Tsing Yi]] and [[Kwai Tsing]], where a much wider variety of shopping options are available.\n\nCitygate Outlets is at the heart of this new town, developed in conjunction with the [[Tung Chung Station (MTR)|Tung Chung MTR Station]] and bus terminus, thus providing a focal point to the town. Citygate, developed in the glass and steel style of the Hong Kong International Airport, contains 500,000 square feet (46,000 m<sup>2</sup>) of shopping, entertainment, and food outlets spread across five floors. A square outside the mall contains a special fountain which performs a musical show regularly.\n\n'''Yat Tung''' is a newer development; the first and second phase was completed in March 2001 and May 2002 respectively. It provides supermarkets, services, and a number of eating outlets.\n\nBoth Asian and Western cuisines are available at the many restaurants in Tung Chung, including Chinese, Vietnamese, Italian, American, Thai, Japanese, and Korean.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} It is also possible to have a meal at a temple behind the [[Tung Chung Battery]] and at a restaurant in [[Po Lin Monastery]] which serves vegetarian food.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\nNear the [[Ngong Ping 360|Ngong Ping cable car]] terminal, there are restaurants and bars offering Asian and European dishes.\n\n==Sights and attractions==\n\n===Tung Chung Fort===\n[[File:Tung chung fort.jpg|frame|Tung Chung Fort, Lantau, Hong Kong]]\n[[Tung Chung Fort]] was built in 1817, when the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Government was alarmed by the rampant [[pirate|piracy]] of [[Cheung Po Tsai]] (though Cheung himself had been captured seven years earlier) and decided to intervene and thwart the [[opium trade]] and defend the coast from pirates. The Fort was [[Declared monuments of Hong Kong|declared a monument]] in 1979. There are 6 old muzzle-loading cannons (still intact), each resting on a cement base and the enclosures are made of [[granite]] blocks, measuring 70 by 80 meters. Three arched gateways, each engraved with a Chinese inscription, are spaced along the walls. Tung Chung Fort itself went through several transformations. It was first used as a police station and then as a secondary school. Now, it is the base for the Rural Committee Office and the Tung Chung Public School.\n\n===Hau Wong Temple===\n[[Image: Hau Wong Temple, Tung Chung.jpg|thumb|Hau Wong Temple]]\n[[Hau Wong Temple]], a tiered-roof structure built in 1765, is dedicated to [[Yeung Hau]], a loyal court official of the [[Song Dynasty]] who died with [[Emperor Bing of Song China|its last emperor]]. And this temple was a place for training soldiers in the Qing Dynasty. There is a stele founded in 1777, which is an important product of culture for researches about the Qing Dynasty. Recently renovated, the temple features lavish interior decorations. The temple is over 200 years old. The row of miniature human figures on the eaves looks still very real to life. On the 18th of the eighth month in the [[lunar calendar]] every year, there are activities such as [[Chinese opera]]s and gatherings in the open area of the temple, to celebrate the birthday of Hau Wong.\n\nThe temple is twenty minutes walking distance from the train station.\n\n===Tin Hau Temple===\nA [[Tin Hau Temple]] is located in [[Chek Lap Kok New Village]], Wong Lung Hang Road, Tung Chung. The temple was initially built in 1823 at the north east of [[Chek Lap Kok]]. It was dismantled in 1991 because of the construction of [[Hong Kong International Airport|the new airport]], and was rebuilt in 1994 at its present location.<ref>[http://www.islandsdc.gov.hk/index.php?action=sight&did=2&sid=8 Exploring Islands - Tung Chung] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BiSuxpGc?url=http://www.islandsdc.gov.hk/index.php?action=sight |date=27 October 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"1444 HB\">[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB_brief_info_en.pdf Antiquities and Monuments Offices - Introduction to 1444 Historic Buildings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013022841/http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB_brief_info_en.pdf |date=13 October 2012 }}</ref> It is a [[List of Grade I historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade I historic building]].<ref name=\"AMO\">[http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/historical.pdf List of Graded Historic Buildings in Hong Kong (as at 6 November 2009)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709224215/http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/historical.pdf |date=9 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Tung Chung Battery===\n[[File: Tung Chung Battery, 2013-09-08.jpg|thumb|Tung Chung Battery]]\n[[Tung Chung Battery]] was one of the two military forts built in 1817 at the foot of the [[Rocky Lion Hill]] at Tung Chung according to the Guangdong Annals. Its remains were discovered on a hill slope facing the sea near Tung Chung pier in 1980. An L-shaped wall with a platform at the corner, probably for gun emplacements, was revealed after clearing the dense undergrowth.\n\n===Lo Hon Temple===\n[[Lo Hon Monastery]], at [[Shek Mun Kap]]. Built by lay Buddhists in 1974, it occupies the site of a grotto named Lo Hon Cavern where a hermit from [[Guangdong]] practiced [[Buddhism]] in 1926.\n\n===Ngong Ping: Big Buddha, Po Lin Monastery and Ngong Ping 360===\n[[Image:Hong Kong Budha.jpg|thumb|200px|Big Buddha]]\n\nTung Chung serves as the gateway for those wishing to explore [[Ngong Ping]]'s [[Tian Tan Buddha|Big Buddha]], the world's largest seated outdoor bronze Buddha statue; and [[Po Lin Monastery]].\n\nNgong Ping can be reached by:\n* The [[Ngong Ping 360]] cable car\n* Buses from Tung Chung Town Centre; plying between Tung Chung and Ngong Ping via Tung Chung Road and South Lantau Highway\n* Hiking trail\n\n==Nature==\n[[File:Tung Chung River (Hong Kong).jpg|thumb|220px|Tung Chung River]]\nTung Chung is surrounded by two large [[Hong Kong Country Parks & Special Areas|country parks]], cover an area of Lantau Island as large as Hong Kong Island: The [[Lantau North Country Park|Lantau North]] and [[Lantau South Country Park|Lantau South]] Country Parks.\n\nThe presence of [[mangrove]]s and freshwater streams in Tung Chung provides excellent ecologically valuable habitats for freshwater fish species, [[dragonflies]] and rare [[amphibia]]ns.\n\nHowever, the reclamation and other civil engineering works in Tung Chung has heavily damaged these habitats and produced irreversible damage to native wildlife and the surrounding environment.\n\n===Tung Chung Valley===\nThe hiking route begins at [[Ngong Ping]], from the [[Tian Tan Buddha|Big Buddha]] follow signs for [[Lantau Peak]]. The total length is 8&nbsp; km. The route winds around the northern slopes of Lantau Peak and descends into Tung Chung Valley. The trail passes woodland, mountain streams and also hillside monasteries. The impressive views over [[Shek Pik]] make a strong contrast with the airport which is seen in the distance. Side paths skirt the small monasteries seen along the way. All around are natural hillsides, rich with life forms, some of them rare.\n\nTung Chung Valley is the home of some of the steepest and most primeval mountain streams in Hong Kong. The formation of spectacular [[waterfall]]s is facilitated in the presence of the sheer cliffs and deep gorges in the valley.\n\nAlmost all the streams in the area have their name related to ''Lung'' (the Chinese word for ''[[Chinese dragon|dragon]]'') which is the [[Chinese mythology|Chinese mythological creature]] of the waters and the favorite metaphor for the towering waterfalls.\n\nBeing the main branch of the Tung Chung Valley, the deep-set [[Wong Lung Valley]] is the home of the Wong Lung Stream (The Yellow Dragon). The mainstream has its source on the saddle at the east of [[Sunset Peak (Hong Kong)|Sunset Peak]], but the stream collects water through a large network of feeder streams on both sides of the valley, including the famous Tung-Lung, Pak-Lung, Chong-Lung, and Ngo-Lung Streams, which are known collectively as \"The Five Dragons of Tung Chung\".\n\n===Wong Lung Waterfall===\nWong Lung Waterfall is located in the [[Lantau North Country Park]]. It is named \"Wong-Lung\" since, during a heavy rainstorm, when we view from the high ground, the stream resembles a yellow dragon ready to take off for heaven when it and its feeders are flooded with torrential muddy water, with Wong-Lung as the trunk and the feeders its limbs.\n\n===Tung-Lung Stream===\nTung-Lung Stream spectacular stream that falls seemingly joined together by the torrential water to form continuous fals of more than 700 feet (213 m). Tung-Lung Stream is rich in varieties of rare local wild plants and animals, especially in the primeval forest at an upper stream, among them the unique Hong Kong [[newt]]s (''Paramesotriton hongkongensis'') as well as several species of wild [[orchid]]s.\n\n===Tung Chung Stream===\nTung Chung Stream is the only known Hong Kong site for the rare [[fish]], [[Acrossocheilus (Lissolichthys) wenchowensis beijiangensis]] (\u5317\u6c5f\u5149\u5507\u9b5a) and one of only two sites on Lantau where the locally rare [[crested kingfisher]], ''Megaceryle lugubris'', has been recorded.\n\n===Upper Tung Chung Valley===\nThe upper Tung Chung Valley is an important habitat for [[bird]]s, including thrushes and warblers (Hopkin, pers. comm.). Eagle owls, a species highly sensitive to a disturbance around their nesting sites, breed here (Wilson, pers. comm.). The locally rare [[Hainan blue flycatcher]] probably breeds here (Chalmers, pers. comm.). The largest population of the reptile [[tokay gecko]], ''Gekko gecko'', occurs in the cliffs and boulder crevices in upper Tung Chung Valley (Lau, pers. comm.).\n\nThe woods in the upper Tung Chung Valley are reported to be some of the best on Lantau for rare plant species and for butterflies, including the [[birdwing butterfly]] which breeds here (Reels, pers. comm.).\n\n===Hiking trails===\nHiking trails link Tung Chung to the fishing village of [[Tai O]]. This trail follows the north-western coast of Lantau Island; providing a view of the runway approach to Chek Lap Kok as well as a number of villages and local scenery.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} This, however is a strenuous four-hour trek.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAn easier and well-wooded walk with picnic and barbecue sites also link [[Shui Hau]] to Tung Chung Road. Turning south from Tung Chung Road, visitors can get to the [[Beaches of Hong Kong|Cheung Sha beaches]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Hong Kong Buddhist Youth Camp===\nLocated on a 4,877&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> site near Tung Chung, the Buddhist Youth Camp enables youth and families to share and experience life in a peaceful and natural environment.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}{{tone inline|date=January 2019}} Built in 1979 for HK$3 million, the camp is run by the [[Hong Kong Buddhist Association]].

In October 2010, a public library has opened, behind Citygate outlet shopping center. In April 2011, a [[Public swimming pools in Hong Kong|swimming pool]] opened near the Ngong Ping cable car.\n\nIn the future, an indoor games hall and community center are planned for Tung Chung.

His ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', originally called {{lang|it|Comed\u00eca}} (modern Italian: ''Commedia'') and later christened {{lang|it|Divina}} by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], is widely considered the most important poem of the [[Middle Ages]] and the greatest literary work in the Italian language.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bloom|first=Harold|authorlink=Harold Bloom|title=The Western Canon|url=https://archive.org/details/westerncanonbook00bloo|url-access=registration|year=1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Prue|title=Reading Dante: From Here to Eternity|date=2014|publisher=Liveright Publishing Corporation|location=New York|isbn=978-0-87140-742-9|pages=Introduction}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Late Middle Ages]], most poetry was written in [[Latin]], making it accessible only to the most educated readers. In ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'' (''On Eloquence in the Vernacular''), however, Dante defended the use of the [[vernacular]] in literature. He would even write in the [[Tuscan dialect]] for works such as ''[[La Vita Nuova|The New Life]]'' (1295) and the ''Divine Comedy''; this highly unorthodox choice set a precedent that important later Italian writers such as [[Petrarch]] and Boccaccio would follow.\n\nDante was instrumental in establishing the literature of Italy, and his depictions of [[Hell]], [[Purgatory]] and [[Heaven]] provided inspiration for the larger body of [[Western art]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Haller |first=Elizabeth K. |editor-first=Lister M. |editor-last=Matheson |title=Icons of the Middle Ages: Rulers, Writers, Rebels, and Saints |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rETxD8KcnUIC&pg=PA244 |volume=1 |publisher=Greenwood |location=Santa Barbara, CA |date=2012 |page=244 |chapter=Dante Alighieri |isbn=978-0-313-34080-2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Human accomplishment: the pursuit of excellence in the arts and sciences, 800 B.C. to 1950|last=A.|first=Murray, Charles|date=2003|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-019247-1|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=52047270|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/humanaccomplishm00murr}}</ref> He is cited as an influence on [[John Milton]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]], among many others.

The exact date of his birth is unknown, although it is generally believed to be around 1265. This can be deduced from autobiographic allusions in the ''[[Divine Comedy]].'' Its first section, the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]],'' begins, ''\"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita\"'' (\"Midway upon the journey of our life\"), implying that Dante was around 35 years old, since the average lifespan according to the Bible (Psalm 89:10<!-- do not change to Ps. 90; in the Vulgate, as specified, the chapter is 89 -->, Vulgate) is 70 years; and since his imaginary travel to the netherworld took place in 1300, he was most probably born around 1265. Some verses of the ''Paradiso'' section of the ''Divine Comedy'' also provide a possible clue that he was born under the sign of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]: \"As I revolved with the eternal twins, I saw revealed, from hills to river outlets, the threshing-floor that makes us so ferocious\" (XXII&nbsp;151\u2013154). In 1265, the sun was in Gemini between approximately May 11 and June 11 ([[Julian calendar]]).<ref>His birth date is listed as \"probably in the end of May\" by Robert Hollander in \"Dante\" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]],'' volume&nbsp;4. According to Boccaccio, the poet himself said he was born in May. See \"Alighieri, Dante\" in the ''Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani.''</ref>\n\n[[File:Dante-alighieri.jpg|thumb|''Dante Alighieri'', attributed to [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]], in the chapel of the [[Bargello]] palace in Florence. This oldest picture of Dante was painted just prior to his exile and has since been heavily restored.]]\n[[File:Dante alighieri, Palazzo dei Giudici.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait of Dante, from a fresco in the Palazzo dei Giudici, Florence]]\n[[Giovanni Boccaccio]] described Dante's appearance and demeanor as follows: \"the poet was of middle height, and in his later years he walked somewhat bent over, with a grave and gentle gait. He was clad always in most seemly attire, such as befitted his ripe years. His face was long, his nose aquiline, and his eyes big rather than small. His jaws were large, and his lower lip protruded. He had a brown complexion, his hair and beard were thick, black, and curly, and his countenance was always melancholy and thoughtful.\"<ref>Holbrook, Richard. \"Portraits of Dante from Giotto to Raffael: a critical study, with a concise iconography\". 1911. London: P.L. Warner; Boston, New York, Houghton Mifflin company. p. 16.</ref>\n\nDante claimed that his family descended from the ancient Romans (''Inferno'', XV, 76), but the earliest relative he could mention by name was [[Cacciaguida]] degli Elisei (''Paradiso'', XV, 135), born no earlier than about 1100. Dante's father, Alighiero<ref name=Trecc/> or [[Alighiero di Bellincione]], was a White [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] who suffered no reprisals after the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibellines]] won the [[Battle of Montaperti]] in the middle of the 13th&nbsp;century. This suggests that Alighiero or his family may have enjoyed some protective prestige and status, although some suggest that the politically inactive Alighiero was of such low standing that he was not considered worth exiling.<ref>{{cite book |last=Santagata |first=Marco |date=2012 |title=Dante: Il romanzo della sua vita |url= |location=Milan |publisher=Mondadori |page=21 |isbn=978-88-04-62026-6 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nDante's family was loyal to the Guelphs, a political alliance that supported the [[Papacy]] and which was involved in complex opposition to the Ghibellines, who were backed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. The poet's mother was Bella, probably a member of the Abati family.<ref name=Trecc/> She died when Dante was not yet ten years old, and Alighiero soon married again, to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. It is uncertain whether he really married her, since widowers were socially limited in such matters, but this woman definitely bore him two children, Dante's half-brother Francesco and half-sister Tana (Gaetana). When Dante was 12, he was promised in marriage to Gemma di Manetto Donati, daughter of Manetto Donati, member of the powerful Donati family.<ref name=Trecc>{{cite book|work=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|publisher=[[Enciclopedia Italiana]]|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dante-alighieri_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=Alighieri, Dante|first=S.A|last=Chimenz|language=Italian|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}</ref> Contracting marriages at this early age was quite common and involved a formal ceremony, including contracts signed before a [[civil law notary|notary]]. But by this time Dante had fallen in love with another, [[Beatrice Portinari]] (known also as Bice), whom he first met when he was only nine. Years after his marriage to Gemma he claims to have met Beatrice again; he wrote several sonnets to Beatrice but never mentioned Gemma in any of his poems. The exact date of his marriage is not known: the only certain information is that, before his exile in 1301, he had three children (Pietro, Jacopo and Antonia).<ref name=Trecc/>\n\nDante fought with the Guelph cavalry at the [[Battle of Campaldino]] (June 11, 1289).<ref name=\"Davenport2005\">{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=John|title=Dante: Poet, Author, and Proud Florentine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWWKW15MjqMC&pg=PA53|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0415-7|page=53|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}</ref> This victory brought about a reformation of the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] constitution. To take any part in public life, one had to enroll in one of the city's many commercial or artisan guilds, so Dante entered the Physicians' and Apothecaries' Guild. In the following years, his name is occasionally recorded as speaking or voting in the various councils of the republic. A substantial portion of minutes from such meetings in the years 1298\u20131300 was lost, however, so the true extent of Dante's participation in the city's councils is uncertain.\n\nGemma bore Dante several children. Although several others subsequently claimed to be his offspring, it is likely that only [[Jacopo Alighieri|Jacopo]], Pietro, Giovanni, and Antonia were his actual children. Antonia later became a nun, taking the name Sister Beatrice.\n\n===Education and poetry===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:DanteFresco.jpg|thumb|upright|Mural of Dante in the [[Uffizi]], Florence, by [[Andrea del Castagno]], c. 1450]]\n\nNot much is known about Dante's education; he presumably studied at home or in a chapter school attached to a church or monastery in Florence.

His interests brought him to discover the [[Occitan|Proven\u00e7al]] poetry of the [[troubadours]], such as [[Arnaut Daniel]], and the Latin writers of [[classical antiquity]], including [[Cicero]], [[Ovid]] and especially [[Virgil]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/dante-alighieri |title=Dante Alighieri |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=poets.org |publisher=Academy of American Poets |access-date=20 December 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nDante said he first met [[Beatrice Portinari]], daughter of [[Folco Portinari]], at age nine, and claimed to have fallen in love with her \"[[Love at first sight|at first sight]]\", apparently without even talking with her.<ref>{{cite book |title=Delphi Complete Works of Dante Alighieri |edition= Illustrated |volume=6 |author=Dante Alighieri |publisher= Delphi Classics |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-909496-19-4}}</ref> He saw her frequently after age 18, often exchanging greetings in the street, but never knew her well. In effect, he set an example of so-called [[courtly love]], a phenomenon developed in French and Proven\u00e7al poetry of prior centuries. Dante's experience of such love was typical, but his expression of it was unique. It was in the name of this love that Dante left his imprint on the ''[[dolce stil novo]]'' (''sweet new style,'' a term which Dante himself coined), and he would join other contemporary poets and writers in exploring never-before-emphasized aspects of love (''Amore''). Love for Beatrice (as [[Petrarch]] would show for Laura somewhat differently) would be his reason for poetry and for living, together with political passions. In many of his poems, she is depicted as semi-divine, watching over him constantly and providing spiritual instruction, sometimes harshly.

To further his political career, he became a pharmacist. He did not intend to practice as one, but a law issued in 1295 required nobles aspiring to public office to be enrolled in one of the Corporazioni delle Arti e dei Mestieri, so Dante obtained admission to the Apothecaries' Guild. This profession was not inappropriate since at that time books were sold from apothecaries' shops. As a politician, he accomplished little but held various offices over some years in a city rife with political unrest.\n\nAfter defeating the Ghibellines, the Guelphs divided into two factions: the White Guelphs (''Guelfi Bianchi'')\u2014Dante's party, led by Vieri dei Cerchi\u2014and the Black Guelphs (''Guelfi Neri''), led by [[Corso Donati]]. Although the split was along family lines at first, ideological differences arose based on opposing views of the papal role in Florentine affairs, with the Blacks supporting the Pope and the Whites wanting more freedom from Rome. The Whites took power first and expelled the Blacks. In response, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] planned a military occupation of Florence. In 1301, [[Charles of Valois]], brother of King [[Philip IV of France]], was expected to visit Florence because the Pope had appointed him peacemaker for [[Tuscany]]. But the city's government had treated the Pope's ambassadors badly a few weeks before, seeking independence from papal influence. It was believed that Charles had received other unofficial instructions, so the council sent a delegation to Rome to ascertain the Pope's intentions. Dante was one of the delegates.\n\n===Exile and death===\nPope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time (November 1, 1301), Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. A new Black Guelph government was installed, and [[Cante dei Gabrielli]] da [[Gubbio]] was appointed ''[[podest\u00e0]]'' of the city. In March 1302, Dante, a White Guelph by affiliation, along with the [[Gherardini family]], was condemned to exile for two years and ordered to pay a large fine.<ref>[[Dino Compagni]], ''Cronica delle cose occorrenti ne' tempi suoi''</ref> Dante was accused of corruption and financial wrongdoing by the Black Guelphs for the time that Dante was serving as city prior (Florence's highest position) for two months in 1300.<ref>Robert Harrison, \"Dante on Trial\", ''NY Review of Books'', February 19, 2015, pp. 36\u201337</ref> The poet was still in Rome in 1302 where the Pope, who had backed the Black Guelphs, had \"suggested\" that Dante stay.

He was condemned to perpetual exile; if he returned to Florence without paying the fine, he could have been burned at the stake. (In June 2008, nearly seven centuries after his death, the city council of Florence passed a motion rescinding Dante's sentence.)<ref>Malcolm Moore [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2145378/Dante's-infernal-crimes-forgiven.html \"Dante's infernal crimes forgiven\"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', June 17, 2008.

Dante, bitter at the treatment he received from his enemies, also grew disgusted with the infighting and ineffectiveness of his erstwhile allies and vowed to become a party of one. He went to [[Verona, Italy|Verona]] as a guest of [[Bartolomeo I della Scala]], then moved to [[Sarzana]] in Liguria. Later he is supposed to have lived in [[Lucca]] with a woman called Gentucca, who made his stay comfortable (and was later gratefully mentioned in ''Purgatorio'', XXIV, 37). Some speculative sources claim he visited Paris between 1308 and 1310, and other sources even less trustworthy took him to [[Oxford]]: these claims, first occurring in [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s book on Dante several decades after his death, seem inspired by readers who were impressed with the poet's wide learning and erudition. Evidently, Dante's command of philosophy and his literary interests deepened in exile and when he was no longer busy with the day-to-day business of Florentine domestic politics, and this is evidenced in his prose writings in this period, but there is no real evidence that he ever left Italy. Dante's ''Immensa Dei dilectione testante'' to Henry VII of Luxembourg confirms his residence \"beneath the springs of Arno, near Tuscany\" in March 1311.\n\nIn 1310, Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of [[Luxembourg]] marched into Italy at the head of 5,000 troops. Dante saw in him a new [[Charlemagne]] who would restore the office of the Holy Roman Emperor to its former glory and also retake Florence from the Black Guelphs. He wrote to Henry and several Italian princes, demanding that they destroy the Black Guelphs. Mixing religion and private concerns in his writings, he invoked the worst anger of God against his city and suggested several particular targets that were also his personal enemies. It was during this time that he wrote ''[[De Monarchia]]'', proposing a [[universal monarchy]] under Henry VII.\n\nAt some point during his exile, he conceived of the ''Comedy'', but the date is uncertain. The work is much more assured and on a larger scale than anything he had produced in Florence; it is likely he would have undertaken such a work only after he realized his political ambitions, which had been central to him up to his banishment, had been halted for some time, possibly forever. It is also noticeable that Beatrice has returned to his imagination with renewed force and with a wider meaning than in the ''Vita Nuova''; in ''Convivio'' (written c. 1304\u201307) he had declared that the memory of this youthful romance belonged to the past.\n\nAn early outside indication that the poem was underway is a notice by Francesco da Barberino, tucked into his ''Documenti d'Amore'' (''Lessons of Love''), written probably in 1314 or early 1315. Speaking of Virgil, Francesco notes in appreciative words that Dante followed the Roman classic in a poem called \"Comedy\" and that the setting of this poem (or part of it) was the underworld; i.e., hell.<ref>See [http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/francesco-daccorso-tf/ Bookrags.com] and Tigerstedt, E.N. 1967, ''Dante; Tiden Mannen Verket'' (''Dante; The Age, the Man, the Work''), Bonniers, Stockholm, 1967. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The brief note gives no incontestable indication that he himself had seen or read even the ''Inferno'' or that this part had been published at the time, but it indicates composition was well underway and that the sketching of the poem might have begun some years before. (It has been suggested that a knowledge of Dante's work also underlies some of the illuminations in Francesco da Barberino's earlier ''Officiolum'' [c. 1305\u201308], a manuscript that came to light only in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spolia.it/online/en/argomenti/letterature_romanze/filologia/2003/barberino.htm|title=L\u2032''Officiolum'' ritrovato di Francesco da Barberino|author=Fabio M. Bertolo|year= 2003|work=Spolia&nbsp;\u2013 Journal of Medieval Studies|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}</ref>) We know that the ''Inferno'' had been published by 1317; this is established by quoted lines interspersed in the margins of contemporary dated records from [[Bologna]], but there is no certainty as to whether the three parts of the poem were each published in full or, rather, a few cantos at a time. ''Paradiso'' seems to have been published posthumously.\n\nIn Florence, [[Baldo d'Aguglione]] pardoned most of the White Guelphs in exile and allowed them to return. However, Dante had gone too far in his violent letters to ''Arrigo'' (Henry VII) and his sentence was not revoked.\n\n[[File:Monument to Dante (Verona).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Dante Alighieri in Verona]]\nIn 1312 Henry assaulted Florence and defeated the Black Guelphs, but there is no evidence that Dante was involved. Some say he refused to participate in the assault on his city by a foreigner; others suggest that he had become unpopular with the White Guelphs, too, and that any trace of his passage had carefully been removed. Henry VII died (from a fever) in 1313, and with him any hope for Dante to see Florence again. He returned to Verona, where [[Cangrande I della Scala]] allowed him to live in certain security and, presumably, in a fair degree of prosperity. Cangrande was admitted to Dante's Paradise (''Paradiso'', XVII, 76).\n\nDuring the period of his exile Dante corresponded with Dominican theologian Fr.

But for this, Florence required public penance in addition to a heavy fine. Dante refused, preferring to remain in exile. When Uguccione defeated Florence, Dante's death sentence was commuted to house arrest on condition that he go to Florence to swear he would never enter the town again. He refused to go, and his death sentence was confirmed and extended to his sons. He still hoped late in life that he might be invited back to Florence on honorable terms. For Dante, exile was nearly a form of death, stripping him of much of his identity and his heritage. He addressed the pain of exile in ''Paradiso'', XVII (55\u201360), where Cacciaguida, his great-great-grandfather, warns him what to expect:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|it|...

The custodians of the body in Ravenna refused, at one point going so far as to conceal the bones in a false wall of the monastery. Nonetheless, a tomb was built for him in Florence in 1829, in the [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Basilica of Santa Croce]]. That [[cenotaph|tomb has been empty]] ever since, with Dante's body remaining in Ravenna, far from the land he had loved so dearly. The front of his tomb in Florence reads ''Onorate l'altissimo poeta''\u2014which roughly translates as \"Honor the most exalted poet\". The phrase is a quote from the fourth canto of the ''Inferno,'' depicting Virgil's welcome as he returns among the great ancient poets spending eternity in limbo. The ensuing line, ''L'ombra sua torna, ch'era dipartita'' (\"his spirit, which had left us, returns\"), is poignantly absent from the empty tomb.\n\n[[File:Dante.deathmask.jpg|thumb|upright|Recreated death mask of Dante Alighieri in Palazzo Vecchio, Florence]]\nA copy of Dante's so-called death mask has been displayed since 1911 in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]]; scholars today believe it is not a true death mask and was probably carved in 1483, perhaps by Pietro and Tullio Lombardo.<ref>https://www.florenceinferno.com/dante-death-mask/, DANTE DEATH MASK</ref><ref>https://listverse.com/2014/10/22/10-controversial-death-masks-of-famous-people/, 10 Controversial Death Masks Of Famous People</ref>\n\nItaly's first dreadnought battleship was completed in 1913 and named ''[[Italian battleship Dante Alighieri|Dante Alighieri]]'' in honor of him.\n\nOn April 30, 1921, in honor of the 600th anniversary of Dante's death, [[Pope Benedict XV]] promulgated an encyclical named ''[[In praeclara summorum]]'', calling him one \"of the many celebrated geniuses of whom the Catholic faith can boast\" and the \"pride and glory of humanity\".<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xv/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xv_enc_30041921_in-praeclara-summorum_en.html \"''In praeclara summorum'': Encyclical of Pope Benedict XV on Dante\"].

''[[La Vita Nuova]]'' (\"The New Life\") is the only major work that predates it; it is a collection of lyric poems (sonnets and songs) with commentary in prose, ostensibly intended to be circulated in manuscript form, as was customary for such poems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.danteonline.it/english/opere.asp?idope=5&idlang=UK |title=New Life|publisher=Dante online|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}</ref> It also contains, or constructs, the story of his love for [[Beatrice Portinari]], who later served as the ultimate symbol of salvation in the ''Comedy'', a function already indicated in the final pages of the ''Vita Nuova''. The work contains many of Dante's love poems in Tuscan, which was not unprecedented; the vernacular had been regularly used for lyric works before, during all the thirteenth century. However, Dante's commentary on his own work is also in the vernacular\u2014both in the ''Vita Nuova'' and in the ''Convivio''\u2014instead of the Latin that was almost universally used.\n\nThe ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' describes Dante's journey through [[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Hell]] (''Inferno''), [[Divine Comedy#Purgatorio|Purgatory]] (''Purgatorio''), and [[9 spheres of heaven|Paradise]] (''Paradiso''); he is first guided by the Roman poet [[Virgil]] and then by [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]]. Of the books, ''Purgatorio'' is arguably the most lyrical of the three, referring to more contemporary poets and artists than ''Inferno''; ''Paradiso'' is the most heavily theological, and the one in which, many scholars have argued, the ''Divine Comedy'''s most beautiful and mystic passages appear (e.g., when Dante looks into the face of God: \"all'alta fantasia qui manc\u00f2 possa\"\u2014\"at this high moment, ability failed my capacity to describe,\" ''Paradiso,'' XXXIII, 142).\n\nWith its seriousness of purpose, its literary stature and the range\u2014both stylistic and thematic\u2014of its content, the ''Comedy'' soon became a cornerstone in the evolution of Italian as an established literary language. Dante was more aware than most early Italian writers of the variety of Italian dialects and of the need to create a literature and a unified literary language beyond the limits of Latin writing at the time; in that sense, he is a forerunner of the [[Renaissance]], with its effort to create vernacular literature in competition with earlier classical writers. Dante's in-depth knowledge (within the limits of his time) of Roman antiquity, and his evident admiration for some aspects of pagan Rome, also point forward to the 15th century. Ironically, while he was widely honored in the centuries after his death, the ''Comedy'' slipped out of fashion among men of letters: too medieval, too rough and tragic, and not stylistically refined in the respects that the high and late Renaissance came to demand of literature.\n\nHe wrote the ''Comedy'' in a language he called \"Italian\", in some sense an amalgamated literary language mostly based on the regional dialect of Tuscany, but with some elements of Latin and other regional dialects.<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{Britannica|151164|Dante}}</ref> He deliberately aimed to reach a readership throughout Italy including laymen, clergymen and other poets. By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose, he established that the Italian language was suitable for the highest sort of expression. In French, Italian is sometimes nicknamed ''la langue de Dante''. Publishing in the vernacular language marked Dante as one of the first in [[Roman Catholic]] Western Europe (among others such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]) to break free from standards of publishing in only Latin (the language of [[liturgy]], history and scholarship in general, but often also of lyric poetry). This break set a precedent and allowed more literature to be published for a wider audience, setting the stage for greater levels of literacy in the future. However, unlike Boccaccio, [[John Milton|Milton]] or [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]], Dante did not really become an author read across Europe until the Romantic era. To the Romantics, Dante, like [[Homer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], was a prime example of the \"original genius\" who set his own rules, created persons of overpowering stature and depth, and went far beyond any imitation of the patterns of earlier masters; and who, in turn, could not truly be imitated.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Throughout the 19th century, Dante's reputation grew and solidified; and by 1865, the 600th anniversary of his birth, he had become established as one of the greatest literary icons of the Western world.\n\nNew readers often wonder how such a serious work may be called a \"comedy\". [[Comedy#Etymology|In the classical sense]] the word ''comedy'' refers to works which reflect belief in an ordered universe, in which events tend toward not only a happy or amusing ending but one influenced by a Providential will that orders all things to an ultimate good. By this meaning of the word, as Dante himself wrote in a letter to [[Cangrande I della Scala]], the progression of the pilgrimage from Hell to Paradise is the paradigmatic expression of comedy, since the work begins with the pilgrim's moral confusion and ends with the vision of God.\n\nDante's other works include ''[[Convivio]]'' (\"The Banquet\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danteonline.it/english/opere.asp?idope=2&idlang=UK|title=Banquet|publisher=Dante online|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}</ref> a collection of his longest poems with an (unfinished) allegorical commentary; ''[[De Monarchia]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danteonline.it/english/opere.asp?idope=4&idlang=UK|title=Monarchia|publisher=Dante online|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}</ref> a summary treatise of political philosophy in Latin which was condemned and burned after Dante's death<ref>Anthony K.

In ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'' (''On Eloquence in the Vernacular''), however, Dante defended the use of the [[vernacular]] in literature. He would even write in the [[Tuscan dialect]] for works such as ''[[La Vita Nuova|The New Life]]'' (1295) and the ''Divine Comedy''; this highly unorthodox choice set a precedent that important later Italian writers such as [[Petrarch]] and Boccaccio would follow.\n\nDante was instrumental in establishing the literature of Italy, and his depictions of [[Hell]], [[Purgatory]] and [[Heaven]] provided inspiration for the larger body of [[Western art]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Haller |first=Elizabeth K. |editor-first=Lister M. |editor-last=Matheson |title=Icons of the Middle Ages: Rulers, Writers, Rebels, and Saints |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rETxD8KcnUIC&pg=PA244 |volume=1 |publisher=Greenwood |location=Santa Barbara, CA |date=2012 |page=244 |chapter=Dante Alighieri |isbn=978-0-313-34080-2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Human accomplishment: the pursuit of excellence in the arts and sciences, 800 B.C. to 1950|last=A.|first=Murray, Charles|date=2003|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-019247-1|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=52047270|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/humanaccomplishm00murr}}</ref> He is cited as an influence on [[John Milton]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]], among many others.

Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio are also called the {{lang|it|tre corone}} (\"three crowns\") of Italian literature.\n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\nDante was born in [[Florence]], [[Republic of Florence]], in what is now Italy. The exact date of his birth is unknown, although it is generally believed to be around 1265. This can be deduced from autobiographic allusions in the ''[[Divine Comedy]].'' Its first section, the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]],'' begins, ''\"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita\"'' (\"Midway upon the journey of our life\"), implying that Dante was around 35 years old, since the average lifespan according to the Bible (Psalm 89:10<!-- do not change to Ps. 90; in the Vulgate, as specified, the chapter is 89 -->, Vulgate) is 70 years; and since his imaginary travel to the netherworld took place in 1300, he was most probably born around 1265. Some verses of the ''Paradiso'' section of the ''Divine Comedy'' also provide a possible clue that he was born under the sign of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]: \"As I revolved with the eternal twins, I saw revealed, from hills to river outlets, the threshing-floor that makes us so ferocious\" (XXII&nbsp;151\u2013154). In 1265, the sun was in Gemini between approximately May 11 and June 11 ([[Julian calendar]]).<ref>His birth date is listed as \"probably in the end of May\" by Robert Hollander in \"Dante\" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]],'' volume&nbsp;4. According to Boccaccio, the poet himself said he was born in May. See \"Alighieri, Dante\" in the ''Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani.''</ref>\n\n[[File:Dante-alighieri.jpg|thumb|''Dante Alighieri'', attributed to [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]], in the chapel of the [[Bargello]] palace in Florence. This oldest picture of Dante was painted just prior to his exile and has since been heavily restored.]]\n[[File:Dante alighieri, Palazzo dei Giudici.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait of Dante, from a fresco in the Palazzo dei Giudici, Florence]]\n[[Giovanni Boccaccio]] described Dante's appearance and demeanor as follows: \"the poet was of middle height, and in his later years he walked somewhat bent over, with a grave and gentle gait. He was clad always in most seemly attire, such as befitted his ripe years. His face was long, his nose aquiline, and his eyes big rather than small. His jaws were large, and his lower lip protruded. He had a brown complexion, his hair and beard were thick, black, and curly, and his countenance was always melancholy and thoughtful.\"<ref>Holbrook, Richard. \"Portraits of Dante from Giotto to Raffael: a critical study, with a concise iconography\". 1911. London: P.L. Warner; Boston, New York, Houghton Mifflin company. p. 16.</ref>\n\nDante claimed that his family descended from the ancient Romans (''Inferno'', XV, 76), but the earliest relative he could mention by name was [[Cacciaguida]] degli Elisei (''Paradiso'', XV, 135), born no earlier than about 1100. Dante's father, Alighiero<ref name=Trecc/> or [[Alighiero di Bellincione]], was a White [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] who suffered no reprisals after the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibellines]] won the [[Battle of Montaperti]] in the middle of the 13th&nbsp;century. This suggests that Alighiero or his family may have enjoyed some protective prestige and status, although some suggest that the politically inactive Alighiero was of such low standing that he was not considered worth exiling.<ref>{{cite book |last=Santagata |first=Marco |date=2012 |title=Dante: Il romanzo della sua vita |url= |location=Milan |publisher=Mondadori |page=21 |isbn=978-88-04-62026-6 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nDante's family was loyal to the Guelphs, a political alliance that supported the [[Papacy]] and which was involved in complex opposition to the Ghibellines, who were backed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. The poet's mother was Bella, probably a member of the Abati family.<ref name=Trecc/> She died when Dante was not yet ten years old, and Alighiero soon married again, to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. It is uncertain whether he really married her, since widowers were socially limited in such matters, but this woman definitely bore him two children, Dante's half-brother Francesco and half-sister Tana (Gaetana). When Dante was 12, he was promised in marriage to Gemma di Manetto Donati, daughter of Manetto Donati, member of the powerful Donati family.<ref name=Trecc>{{cite book|work=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|publisher=[[Enciclopedia Italiana]]|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dante-alighieri_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=Alighieri, Dante|first=S.A|last=Chimenz|language=Italian|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}</ref> Contracting marriages at this early age was quite common and involved a formal ceremony, including contracts signed before a [[civil law notary|notary]]. But by this time Dante had fallen in love with another, [[Beatrice Portinari]] (known also as Bice), whom he first met when he was only nine. Years after his marriage to Gemma he claims to have met Beatrice again; he wrote several sonnets to Beatrice but never mentioned Gemma in any of his poems. The exact date of his marriage is not known: the only certain information is that, before his exile in 1301, he had three children (Pietro, Jacopo and Antonia).<ref name=Trecc/>\n\nDante fought with the Guelph cavalry at the [[Battle of Campaldino]] (June 11, 1289).<ref name=\"Davenport2005\">{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=John|title=Dante: Poet, Author, and Proud Florentine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWWKW15MjqMC&pg=PA53|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0415-7|page=53|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}</ref> This victory brought about a reformation of the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] constitution. To take any part in public life, one had to enroll in one of the city's many commercial or artisan guilds, so Dante entered the Physicians' and Apothecaries' Guild. In the following years, his name is occasionally recorded as speaking or voting in the various councils of the republic. A substantial portion of minutes from such meetings in the years 1298\u20131300 was lost, however, so the true extent of Dante's participation in the city's councils is uncertain.\n\nGemma bore Dante several children. Although several others subsequently claimed to be his offspring, it is likely that only [[Jacopo Alighieri|Jacopo]], Pietro, Giovanni, and Antonia were his actual children. Antonia later became a nun, taking the name Sister Beatrice.\n\n===Education and poetry===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:DanteFresco.jpg|thumb|upright|Mural of Dante in the [[Uffizi]], Florence, by [[Andrea del Castagno]], c. 1450]]\n\nNot much is known about Dante's education; he presumably studied at home or in a chapter school attached to a church or monastery in Florence.

His interests brought him to discover the [[Occitan|Proven\u00e7al]] poetry of the [[troubadours]], such as [[Arnaut Daniel]], and the Latin writers of [[classical antiquity]], including [[Cicero]], [[Ovid]] and especially [[Virgil]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/dante-alighieri |title=Dante Alighieri |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=poets.org |publisher=Academy of American Poets |access-date=20 December 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nDante said he first met [[Beatrice Portinari]], daughter of [[Folco Portinari]], at age nine, and claimed to have fallen in love with her \"[[Love at first sight|at first sight]]\", apparently without even talking with her.<ref>{{cite book |title=Delphi Complete Works of Dante Alighieri |edition= Illustrated |volume=6 |author=Dante Alighieri |publisher= Delphi Classics |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-909496-19-4}}</ref> He saw her frequently after age 18, often exchanging greetings in the street, but never knew her well. In effect, he set an example of so-called [[courtly love]], a phenomenon developed in French and Proven\u00e7al poetry of prior centuries. Dante's experience of such love was typical, but his expression of it was unique. It was in the name of this love that Dante left his imprint on the ''[[dolce stil novo]]'' (''sweet new style,'' a term which Dante himself coined), and he would join other contemporary poets and writers in exploring never-before-emphasized aspects of love (''Amore''). Love for Beatrice (as [[Petrarch]] would show for Laura somewhat differently) would be his reason for poetry and for living, together with political passions. In many of his poems, she is depicted as semi-divine, watching over him constantly and providing spiritual instruction, sometimes harshly. When Beatrice died in 1290, Dante sought refuge in Latin literature.<ref>{{cite book |title= Names and Naming in Young Adult Literature |volume=27 |author= Alleen Pace Nilsen, Don L.F.

To further his political career, he became a pharmacist. He did not intend to practice as one, but a law issued in 1295 required nobles aspiring to public office to be enrolled in one of the Corporazioni delle Arti e dei Mestieri, so Dante obtained admission to the Apothecaries' Guild. This profession was not inappropriate since at that time books were sold from apothecaries' shops. As a politician, he accomplished little but held various offices over some years in a city rife with political unrest.\n\nAfter defeating the Ghibellines, the Guelphs divided into two factions: the White Guelphs (''Guelfi Bianchi'')\u2014Dante's party, led by Vieri dei Cerchi\u2014and the Black Guelphs (''Guelfi Neri''), led by [[Corso Donati]]. Although the split was along family lines at first, ideological differences arose based on opposing views of the papal role in Florentine affairs, with the Blacks supporting the Pope and the Whites wanting more freedom from Rome. The Whites took power first and expelled the Blacks. In response, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] planned a military occupation of Florence. In 1301, [[Charles of Valois]], brother of King [[Philip IV of France]], was expected to visit Florence because the Pope had appointed him peacemaker for [[Tuscany]]. But the city's government had treated the Pope's ambassadors badly a few weeks before, seeking independence from papal influence. It was believed that Charles had received other unofficial instructions, so the council sent a delegation to Rome to ascertain the Pope's intentions. Dante was one of the delegates.\n\n===Exile and death===\nPope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time (November 1, 1301), Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. A new Black Guelph government was installed, and [[Cante dei Gabrielli]] da [[Gubbio]] was appointed ''[[podest\u00e0]]'' of the city. In March 1302, Dante, a White Guelph by affiliation, along with the [[Gherardini family]], was condemned to exile for two years and ordered to pay a large fine.<ref>[[Dino Compagni]], ''Cronica delle cose occorrenti ne' tempi suoi''</ref> Dante was accused of corruption and financial wrongdoing by the Black Guelphs for the time that Dante was serving as city prior (Florence's highest position) for two months in 1300.<ref>Robert Harrison, \"Dante on Trial\", ''NY Review of Books'', February 19, 2015, pp. 36\u201337</ref> The poet was still in Rome in 1302 where the Pope, who had backed the Black Guelphs, had \"suggested\" that Dante stay.

He was condemned to perpetual exile; if he returned to Florence without paying the fine, he could have been burned at the stake. (In June 2008, nearly seven centuries after his death, the city council of Florence passed a motion rescinding Dante's sentence.)<ref>Malcolm Moore [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2145378/Dante's-infernal-crimes-forgiven.html \"Dante's infernal crimes forgiven\"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', June 17, 2008.

Dante, bitter at the treatment he received from his enemies, also grew disgusted with the infighting and ineffectiveness of his erstwhile allies and vowed to become a party of one. He went to [[Verona, Italy|Verona]] as a guest of [[Bartolomeo I della Scala]], then moved to [[Sarzana]] in Liguria. Later he is supposed to have lived in [[Lucca]] with a woman called Gentucca, who made his stay comfortable (and was later gratefully mentioned in ''Purgatorio'', XXIV, 37). Some speculative sources claim he visited Paris between 1308 and 1310, and other sources even less trustworthy took him to [[Oxford]]: these claims, first occurring in [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s book on Dante several decades after his death, seem inspired by readers who were impressed with the poet's wide learning and erudition. Evidently, Dante's command of philosophy and his literary interests deepened in exile and when he was no longer busy with the day-to-day business of Florentine domestic politics, and this is evidenced in his prose writings in this period, but there is no real evidence that he ever left Italy. Dante's ''Immensa Dei dilectione testante'' to Henry VII of Luxembourg confirms his residence \"beneath the springs of Arno, near Tuscany\" in March 1311.\n\nIn 1310, Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of [[Luxembourg]] marched into Italy at the head of 5,000 troops. Dante saw in him a new [[Charlemagne]] who would restore the office of the Holy Roman Emperor to its former glory and also retake Florence from the Black Guelphs. He wrote to Henry and several Italian princes, demanding that they destroy the Black Guelphs. Mixing religion and private concerns in his writings, he invoked the worst anger of God against his city and suggested several particular targets that were also his personal enemies. It was during this time that he wrote ''[[De Monarchia]]'', proposing a [[universal monarchy]] under Henry VII.\n\nAt some point during his exile, he conceived of the ''Comedy'', but the date is uncertain. The work is much more assured and on a larger scale than anything he had produced in Florence; it is likely he would have undertaken such a work only after he realized his political ambitions, which had been central to him up to his banishment, had been halted for some time, possibly forever. It is also noticeable that Beatrice has returned to his imagination with renewed force and with a wider meaning than in the ''Vita Nuova''; in ''Convivio'' (written c. 1304\u201307) he had declared that the memory of this youthful romance belonged to the past.\n\nAn early outside indication that the poem was underway is a notice by Francesco da Barberino, tucked into his ''Documenti d'Amore'' (''Lessons of Love''), written probably in 1314 or early 1315. Speaking of Virgil, Francesco notes in appreciative words that Dante followed the Roman classic in a poem called \"Comedy\" and that the setting of this poem (or part of it) was the underworld; i.e., hell.<ref>See [http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/francesco-daccorso-tf/ Bookrags.com] and Tigerstedt, E.N. 1967, ''Dante; Tiden Mannen Verket'' (''Dante; The Age, the Man, the Work''), Bonniers, Stockholm, 1967. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The brief note gives no incontestable indication that he himself had seen or read even the ''Inferno'' or that this part had been published at the time, but it indicates composition was well underway and that the sketching of the poem might have begun some years before. (It has been suggested that a knowledge of Dante's work also underlies some of the illuminations in Francesco da Barberino's earlier ''Officiolum'' [c. 1305\u201308], a manuscript that came to light only in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spolia.it/online/en/argomenti/letterature_romanze/filologia/2003/barberino.htm|title=L\u2032''Officiolum'' ritrovato di Francesco da Barberino|author=Fabio M.

''Paradiso'' seems to have been published posthumously.\n\nIn Florence, [[Baldo d'Aguglione]] pardoned most of the White Guelphs in exile and allowed them to return. However, Dante had gone too far in his violent letters to ''Arrigo'' (Henry VII) and his sentence was not revoked.\n\n[[File:Monument to Dante (Verona).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Dante Alighieri in Verona]]\nIn 1312 Henry assaulted Florence and defeated the Black Guelphs, but there is no evidence that Dante was involved. Some say he refused to participate in the assault on his city by a foreigner; others suggest that he had become unpopular with the White Guelphs, too, and that any trace of his passage had carefully been removed. Henry VII died (from a fever) in 1313, and with him any hope for Dante to see Florence again. He returned to Verona, where [[Cangrande I della Scala]] allowed him to live in certain security and, presumably, in a fair degree of prosperity. Cangrande was admitted to Dante's Paradise (''Paradiso'', XVII, 76).\n\nDuring the period of his exile Dante corresponded with Dominican theologian Fr.

But for this, Florence required public penance in addition to a heavy fine. Dante refused, preferring to remain in exile. When Uguccione defeated Florence, Dante's death sentence was commuted to house arrest on condition that he go to Florence to swear he would never enter the town again. He refused to go, and his death sentence was confirmed and extended to his sons. He still hoped late in life that he might be invited back to Florence on honorable terms. For Dante, exile was nearly a form of death, stripping him of much of his identity and his heritage. He addressed the pain of exile in ''Paradiso'', XVII (55\u201360), where Cacciaguida, his great-great-grandfather, warns him what to expect:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|it|...

The custodians of the body in Ravenna refused, at one point going so far as to conceal the bones in a false wall of the monastery. Nonetheless, a tomb was built for him in Florence in 1829, in the [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Basilica of Santa Croce]]. That [[cenotaph|tomb has been empty]] ever since, with Dante's body remaining in Ravenna, far from the land he had loved so dearly. The front of his tomb in Florence reads ''Onorate l'altissimo poeta''\u2014which roughly translates as \"Honor the most exalted poet\". The phrase is a quote from the fourth canto of the ''Inferno,'' depicting Virgil's welcome as he returns among the great ancient poets spending eternity in limbo. The ensuing line, ''L'ombra sua torna, ch'era dipartita'' (\"his spirit, which had left us, returns\"), is poignantly absent from the empty tomb.\n\n[[File:Dante.deathmask.jpg|thumb|upright|Recreated death mask of Dante Alighieri in Palazzo Vecchio, Florence]]\nA copy of Dante's so-called death mask has been displayed since 1911 in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]]; scholars today believe it is not a true death mask and was probably carved in 1483, perhaps by Pietro and Tullio Lombardo.<ref>https://www.florenceinferno.com/dante-death-mask/, DANTE DEATH MASK</ref><ref>https://listverse.com/2014/10/22/10-controversial-death-masks-of-famous-people/, 10 Controversial Death Masks Of Famous People</ref>\n\nItaly's first dreadnought battleship was completed in 1913 and named ''[[Italian battleship Dante Alighieri|Dante Alighieri]]'' in honor of him.\n\nOn April 30, 1921, in honor of the 600th anniversary of Dante's death, [[Pope Benedict XV]] promulgated an encyclical named ''[[In praeclara summorum]]'', calling him one \"of the many celebrated geniuses of whom the Catholic faith can boast\" and the \"pride and glory of humanity\".<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xv/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xv_enc_30041921_in-praeclara-summorum_en.html \"''In praeclara summorum'': Encyclical of Pope Benedict XV on Dante\"].

''[[La Vita Nuova]]'' (\"The New Life\") is the only major work that predates it; it is a collection of lyric poems (sonnets and songs) with commentary in prose, ostensibly intended to be circulated in manuscript form, as was customary for such poems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.danteonline.it/english/opere.asp?idope=5&idlang=UK |title=New Life|publisher=Dante online|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}</ref> It also contains, or constructs, the story of his love for [[Beatrice Portinari]], who later served as the ultimate symbol of salvation in the ''Comedy'', a function already indicated in the final pages of the ''Vita Nuova''. The work contains many of Dante's love poems in Tuscan, which was not unprecedented; the vernacular had been regularly used for lyric works before, during all the thirteenth century. However, Dante's commentary on his own work is also in the vernacular\u2014both in the ''Vita Nuova'' and in the ''Convivio''\u2014instead of the Latin that was almost universally used.\n\nThe ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' describes Dante's journey through [[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Hell]] (''Inferno''), [[Divine Comedy#Purgatorio|Purgatory]] (''Purgatorio''), and [[9 spheres of heaven|Paradise]] (''Paradiso''); he is first guided by the Roman poet [[Virgil]] and then by [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]]. Of the books, ''Purgatorio'' is arguably the most lyrical of the three, referring to more contemporary poets and artists than ''Inferno''; ''Paradiso'' is the most heavily theological, and the one in which, many scholars have argued, the ''Divine Comedy'''s most beautiful and mystic passages appear (e.g., when Dante looks into the face of God: \"all'alta fantasia qui manc\u00f2 possa\"\u2014\"at this high moment, ability failed my capacity to describe,\" ''Paradiso,'' XXXIII, 142).\n\nWith its seriousness of purpose, its literary stature and the range\u2014both stylistic and thematic\u2014of its content, the ''Comedy'' soon became a cornerstone in the evolution of Italian as an established literary language. Dante was more aware than most early Italian writers of the variety of Italian dialects and of the need to create a literature and a unified literary language beyond the limits of Latin writing at the time; in that sense, he is a forerunner of the [[Renaissance]], with its effort to create vernacular literature in competition with earlier classical writers. Dante's in-depth knowledge (within the limits of his time) of Roman antiquity, and his evident admiration for some aspects of pagan Rome, also point forward to the 15th century. Ironically, while he was widely honored in the centuries after his death, the ''Comedy'' slipped out of fashion among men of letters: too medieval, too rough and tragic, and not stylistically refined in the respects that the high and late Renaissance came to demand of literature.\n\nHe wrote the ''Comedy'' in a language he called \"Italian\", in some sense an amalgamated literary language mostly based on the regional dialect of Tuscany, but with some elements of Latin and other regional dialects.<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{Britannica|151164|Dante}}</ref> He deliberately aimed to reach a readership throughout Italy including laymen, clergymen and other poets. By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose, he established that the Italian language was suitable for the highest sort of expression. In French, Italian is sometimes nicknamed ''la langue de Dante''. Publishing in the vernacular language marked Dante as one of the first in [[Roman Catholic]] Western Europe (among others such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]) to break free from standards of publishing in only Latin (the language of [[liturgy]], history and scholarship in general, but often also of lyric poetry). This break set a precedent and allowed more literature to be published for a wider audience, setting the stage for greater levels of literacy in the future. However, unlike Boccaccio, [[John Milton|Milton]] or [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]], Dante did not really become an author read across Europe until the Romantic era. To the Romantics, Dante, like [[Homer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], was a prime example of the \"original genius\" who set his own rules, created persons of overpowering stature and depth, and went far beyond any imitation of the patterns of earlier masters; and who, in turn, could not truly be imitated.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Throughout the 19th century, Dante's reputation grew and solidified; and by 1865, the 600th anniversary of his birth, he had become established as one of the greatest literary icons of the Western world.\n\nNew readers often wonder how such a serious work may be called a \"comedy\". [[Comedy#Etymology|In the classical sense]] the word ''comedy'' refers to works which reflect belief in an ordered universe, in which events tend toward not only a happy or amusing ending but one influenced by a Providential will that orders all things to an ultimate good. By this meaning of the word, as Dante himself wrote in a letter to [[Cangrande I della Scala]], the progression of the pilgrimage from Hell to Paradise is the paradigmatic expression of comedy, since the work begins with the pilgrim's moral confusion and ends with the vision of God.\n\nDante's other works include ''[[Convivio]]'' (\"The Banquet\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danteonline.it/english/opere.asp?idope=2&idlang=UK|title=Banquet|publisher=Dante online|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}</ref> a collection of his longest poems with an (unfinished) allegorical commentary; ''[[De Monarchia]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danteonline.it/english/opere.asp?idope=4&idlang=UK|title=Monarchia|publisher=Dante online|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}</ref> a summary treatise of political philosophy in Latin which was condemned and burned after Dante's death<ref>Anthony K.
