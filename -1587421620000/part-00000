It is typically published on the occasion of the honoree's retirement, significant birthday, or other notable career anniversary. A ''Festschrift'' can be anything from a slim volume to a work in several volumes. ''[[Aufstieg und Niedergang der r\u00f6mischen Welt]]'', for example, began in 1972 as a ''Festschrift'' to commemorate the 75th birthday of [[Joseph Vogt]], a German classical historian. Four volumes were planned, but it has since reached 89 volumes (including several which were planned for the next years, but put on hold in 1998). The essays usually relate in some way to, or reflect upon, the honoree's contributions to their scholarly field, but can include important original research by the authors. Many ''Festschriften'' also feature a ''tabula gratulatoria'', an extended list of academic colleagues and friends who send their best wishes to the honoree.\n\nIn the case of prominent academics, several ''Festschriften'' might be prepared by various groups of students and colleagues, particularly if the scholar made significant contributions to different fields.\n\nIn Germany it is an honor to be designated to prepare such a collection, and being selected by a prominent academic to edit a ''Festschrift'', according to [[Claudio Naranjo]], can symbolize the proverbial passing of the torch.<ref>Claudio Naranjo. [http://www.claudionaranjo.net/navbar_english/festschrift_english.html Festschrift]</ref>\n\n[[Endel Tulving]], a Canadian neuroscientist, proposed that \"a Festschrift frequently enough also serves as a convenient place in which those who are invited to contribute find a permanent resting place for their otherwise unpublishable or at least difficult-to-publish papers.\"<ref name=\"Tulving\">{{cite book |author=Endel Tulving |authorlink=Endel Tulving |editor=James S.

Its plural may be either the original ''Festschriften'' or anglicized as ''Festschrifts''.<ref name=\"Michael2004\">{{cite book | author = Michael Agnes, editor in chief | title = Webster's New World College Dictionary, ''fourth edition''  | publisher = Wiley Publishing | year = 2004 | pages = 524 | isbn = 0-02-863118-8}}</ref> Festschriften are often titled something like ''Essays in Honour of...'' or ''Essays Presented to... .''\n\nA ''Festschrift'' compiled and published by electronic means on the internet is called a '''''Webfestschrift''''' (pronounced either {{IPA|[v\u025bp-]}} or {{IPA|[w\u025bb-]}}), a term coined by the editors of the late [[Boris Marshak]]'s Webfestschrift, ''Eran ud Aneran'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transoxiana.org/Eran/ |title=Eran ud Aneran - Transoxiana Webfestschrift Series 2003 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |issn=1666-7050 |website= |publisher=Transoxiana.org |accessdate=2013-10-08}}\n*Information on how the term ''Webfestschrift''\" was coined can be found in [http://www.transoxiana.org/Eran/introduction.html Introduction to the Electronic Version of ''Webfestschrift Marshak'' 2003].\n*Book form: {{cite book |authorlink= |title=\u0112r\u0101n Ud An\u0113r\u0101n: Studies Presented to Boris Il'i\u010d Mar\u0161ak on the Occasion of His 70th Birthday |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJi4AAAACAAJ |accessdate= |year=2006 |publisher=Libreria Editrice Cafoscarina |location=Venice |isbn=9788875431051 |page=}}</ref> published online in October 2003.

It is typically published on the occasion of the honoree's retirement, significant birthday, or other notable career anniversary. A ''Festschrift'' can be anything from a slim volume to a work in several volumes. ''[[Aufstieg und Niedergang der r\u00f6mischen Welt]]'', for example, began in 1972 as a ''Festschrift'' to commemorate the 75th birthday of [[Joseph Vogt]], a German classical historian. Four volumes were planned, but it has since reached 89 volumes (including several which were planned for the next years, but put on hold in 1998). The essays usually relate in some way to, or reflect upon, the honoree's contributions to their scholarly field, but can include important original research by the authors. Many ''Festschriften'' also feature a ''tabula gratulatoria'', an extended list of academic colleagues and friends who send their best wishes to the honoree.\n\nIn the case of prominent academics, several ''Festschriften'' might be prepared by various groups of students and colleagues, particularly if the scholar made significant contributions to different fields.\n\nIn Germany it is an honor to be designated to prepare such a collection, and being selected by a prominent academic to edit a ''Festschrift'', according to [[Claudio Naranjo]], can symbolize the proverbial passing of the torch.<ref>Claudio Naranjo. [http://www.claudionaranjo.net/navbar_english/festschrift_english.html Festschrift]</ref>\n\n[[Endel Tulving]], a Canadian neuroscientist, proposed that \"a Festschrift frequently enough also serves as a convenient place in which those who are invited to contribute find a permanent resting place for their otherwise unpublishable or at least difficult-to-publish papers.\"<ref name=\"Tulving\">{{cite book |author=Endel Tulving |authorlink=Endel Tulving |editor=James S.

The Christopher Whelen Award for innovation in music in film and theatre was set up in his name. Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s.

While there (and from 1955 at other theatres as well) he produced much incidental music for [[Shakespeare]] and other productions.<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol 7 No 1 (Winter 1956), p 85-6</ref> He composed the music  for [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The World of Paul Slickey]]'' (1959). This was Osborne's only attempt to write a musical. But after the huge successes of his previous plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]],'' the play was to become \"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\".<ref>Heilpern, John, ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us'', 2007, Random House, pp.249-54</ref> Despite this setback, the theatre work led to a series of commissions by the [[BBC]] spanning the 1960s to the 1980s for radio productions with original music, including television and radio operas as well as hard to classify music dramas for which Whelen typically wrote both the words and music, fusing the music and action together.\n\nWhelen lived in [[Cumnor]], Oxfordshire for several years before his death in 1993. The Christopher Whelen Award for innovation in music in film and theatre was set up in his name. Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s. His first operatic production, broadcast on 6 August 1961, was [[The Beggar's Opera|''The Beggar's Opera'']], for which he contributed new arrangements of the traditional ballads.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/99c092c336a44340a92d70876927b3e5 ''Radio Times'' Issue 1969, 3 August 1961, p 16]</ref> The original radio opera ''The Cancelling Dark'', with text by the poet [[Vernon Scannell]], followed on 5 December 1965.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56c3c8cc4c014d2a934bbe460e3ca918 ''Radio Times'' Issue 2195, 2 December 1965, p 22]</ref>. The action alternates between a crashed aircraft in the African jungle near [[Benguela]] and the radio control room at [[Kakonda]] Airfield. Jeremy Rundall in ''The Sunday Times'' said it \"has an Ancient Mariner-ish ring, and should be heard again\".<ref>''Sunday Times'', 12 December 1965, p 40</ref> \n\nThe specifically commissioned television opera ''Some Place of Darkness'' used an original libretto by the experienced television writer [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]. The BBC insisted on realism, and the result was \" a sombre domestic drama set in the present, it exemplified all that television promoted\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6fwSLslWOjsC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=%22Some+place+of+darkness%22+%22television+opera%22&source=bl&ots=b_k28mFrbb&sig=ACfU3U2uiIHxXAQHFjddkSSblEjGXMLm6g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwji-7CJovfoAhUNQRUIHeqrACcQ6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Some%20place%20of%20darkness%22%20%22television%20opera%22&f=false Barnes, Jennifer.

'Thoughts on Television Opera' in ''Composer'' 24 (1967), p 17</ref>\n\nBy 1969 for ''Incident at Owl Creek'' Whelen had dispensed with a librettist, adapting the source material (based on the short story by [[Ambrose Bierce]]) himself. This led to him writing a text based on an original idea for ''The Findings'' (1972), concerning the excavation of an [[Etruscan architecture|Etruscan]] tomb.<ref>[[Rodney Milnes|Milnes, Rodney]]: \u2018The Findings\u2019 in ''Opera'' 23 (1972), p 945\u20138</ref> Creating his own plot and characters presented through his own words and music, Whelen was attempting to create a more personal form of \"total musical theatre\".<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/e648c51cd2774f2083924651d29f021c ''Radio Times'', Issue 2540, 13 July 1972 p 20]</ref> Christopher Palmer identified ''The Findings'' and ''Incident at Owl Creek'' (1969) as \"outstanding\".<ref name=grove/> The music drama ''The Restorer'', produced and directed by [[Martin Esslin]], is an example of Whelen's experimentation with the close combination of words and music. It concerns a picture in a Dutch museum and its fascination on visitors. \n\nAnother strand of Whelen's work was in film. He composed the score for [[The Valiant (1962 film)|''The Valiant'']] (1962), [[The Face of Fu Manchu]] (1965) and ''[[Coast of Skeletons]]'' (1965).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0924083/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm IMDb biography]</ref> There was also a ballet, ''Cul de Sac'', choreographed by [[Norman Morrice]] and staged by [[Ballet Rambert]] on 13 July 1964 at [[Sadler's Wells]].<ref>[https://www.rambert.org.uk/performance-database/works/cul-de-sac/ Ballet Rambert performance archive]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1964/07/20/archives/problem-ballet-shown-in-london-rambert-troupe-performs-morrices-cul.html '\u2018Problem\u2019 Ballet Shown in London; Rambert Troupe Performs Morrice's \u2018Cul de Sac\u2019' in ''The New York Times'', 20 July 1964]</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Television and radio operas===\n* ''The Cancelling Dark'', radio opera, libretto by Vernon Scannell (1964)\n* ''Some Place of Darkness'', television opera, libretto by John Hopkins (1967)\n* ''Incident at Owl Creek'', radio opera, libretto Whelen after [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1969)\n* ''The Findings'', radio opera, libretto Whelen (1972)\n\n===Radio drama, words and music by Whelen===\n* ''The Restorer'' (1976)\n*  ''Marius Goring in Bridges'', a play with music written for stereo (1976)\n* ''To the Office and Back'', notes towards a portrait of [[Wallace Stevens]] (1978)\n* ''Cumulus'', a weather fantasy (1980)\n* ''The Jigsaw Must Fit'', 'musico-dramatic' work (1983)\n* ''Ed e Subito Sera'', a portrait of [[Salvatore Quasimodo]] (1984)\n* ''Broad Daylight'', a love story in words and music (1986)\n\n===Selected incidental music for theatre, radio and television===\n* ''Murder in the Cathedral'' by [[T S Eliot]] (1953, Old Vic Company, recording available)<ref>[https://naxosaudiobooks.com/murder-in-the-cathedral-unabridged/ Naxos Audio Books.
