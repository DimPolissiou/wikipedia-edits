''History: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. 17. {{ISBN|0-19-285352-X}}.</ref> Written in 440 BC in the [[Ionic dialect]] of [[classical Greek]], ''The Histories'' serves as a record of the ancient traditions, politics, geography, and clashes of various cultures that were known in [[Western Asia]], [[Northern Africa]] and [[Greece]] at that time.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=May 2015}} Although not a fully impartial record, it remains one of the West's most important sources regarding these affairs. Moreover, it established the [[genre]] and study of [[history]] in the Western world (despite the existence of historical records and [[chronicle]]s beforehand).\n\nThe ''Histories'' also stands as one of the earliest accounts of the rise of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], as well as the events and causes of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] between the Persian Empire and the [[Polis|Greek city-states]] in the 5th century BC. Herodotus portrays the conflict as one between the forces of slavery (the Persians) on the one hand, and freedom (the [[Athenians]] and the confederacy of Greek city-states which united against the invaders) on the other.\n\n''The Histories'' was at some point divided into the nine [[scroll|books]] that appear in modern editions, conventionally named after the nine [[Muses]].\n\n==Motivation for writing==\nHerodotus claims to have traveled extensively around the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], conducting interviews and collecting stories for his book, almost all of which covers territories of the Persian Empire. At the beginning of ''The Histories'', Herodotus sets out his reasons for writing it:\n\n{{quote|Here are presented the results of the enquiry carried out by Herodotus of Halicarnassus. The purpose is to prevent the traces of human events from being erased by time, and to preserve the fame of the important and remarkable achievements produced by both Greeks and non-Greeks; among the matters covered is, in particular, the cause of the hostilities between Greeks and non-Greeks.\n\n|Herodotus, The Histories\n|source=Robin Waterfield translation (2008)}}\n\n== Summary ==\n[[File:Etty-Candaules King of Lydia Shews his Wife to Gyges.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|''[[Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed|Candaules, King of Lydia, shews his wife by stealth to Gyges\u2026]]'', by [[William Etty]] (1830)]]\n\n=== Book I (Clio) ===\n*The rapes of [[Io (mythology)|Io]], [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], and [[Medea]], which motivated [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] to abduct [[Helen of Troy|Helen]].

Moreover, it established the [[genre]] and study of [[history]] in the Western world (despite the existence of historical records and [[chronicle]]s beforehand).\n\nThe ''Histories'' also stands as one of the earliest accounts of the rise of the [[Persian Empire]], as well as the events and causes of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] between the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and the [[Polis|Greek city-states]] in the 5th century BC. Herodotus portrays the conflict as one between the forces of slavery (the [[Persia]]ns) on the one hand, and freedom (the [[Athenians]] and the confederacy of Greek city-states which united against the invaders) on the other.\n\n''The Histories'' was at some point divided into the nine [[scroll|books]] that appear in modern editions, conventionally named after the nine [[Muses]].\n\n==Motivation for writing==\nHerodotus claims to have traveled extensively around the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], conducting interviews and collecting stories for his book, almost all of which covers territories of the Persian Empire. At the beginning of ''The Histories'', Herodotus sets out his reasons for writing it:\n\n{{quote|Here are presented the results of the enquiry carried out by Herodotus of Halicarnassus. The purpose is to prevent the traces of human events from being erased by time, and to preserve the fame of the important and remarkable achievements produced by both Greeks and non-Greeks; among the matters covered is, in particular, the cause of the hostilities between Greeks and non-Greeks.\n\n|Herodotus, The Histories\n|source=Robin Waterfield translation (2008)}}\n\n== Summary ==\n[[File:Etty-Candaules King of Lydia Shews his Wife to Gyges.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|''[[Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed|Candaules, King of Lydia, shews his wife by stealth to Gyges\u2026]]'', by [[William Etty]] (1830)]]\n\n=== Book I (Clio) ===\n*The rapes of [[Io (mythology)|Io]], [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], and [[Medea]], which motivated [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] to abduct [[Helen of Troy|Helen]].

It's written by [[Berry Gordy]], [[Hal Davis]], Bob West, and [[Willie Hutch]].\n\nThe song was recorded by The Jackson 5 and released by [[Motown Records]] on August 28, 1970 as the first single from their ''[[Third Album]]'' on the same date. Produced by the songwriters, \"I'll Be There\" was The Jackson 5's fourth number-one hit in a row (after \"[[I Want You Back]]\" in 1969, \"[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]]\" and \"[[The Love You Save]]\" earlier in 1970), making them the first black male group to achieve four consecutive number-one pop hits. \"I'll Be There\" is also notable as the most successful single released by Motown during its \"Detroit era\" (1959\u201372).\n\nThe cover version/duet by Mariah Carey and Trey Lorenz was recorded during Carey's appearance on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' in 1992, and released as the first single from her EP ''[[MTV Unplugged (Mariah Carey EP)|MTV Unplugged]]'' in the second quarter of 1992. Co-produced by Carey and [[Walter Afanasieff]], \"I'll Be There\" became Carey's sixth number-one single in the U.S., and her biggest hit elsewhere at the time.\n\n==The Jackson 5 version==\n\n===Release and reaction===\nIn his autobiography ''[[Moon Walk (autobiography)|Moon Walk]]'', Michael Jackson noted that \"I'll Be There\" was the song that solidified The Jackson 5's careers and showed audiences that the group had potential beyond bubblegum pop. Said [[Allmusic]] about the song, \"Rarely, if ever, had one so young sung with so much authority and grace, investing this achingly tender ballad with wisdom and understanding far beyond his years\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Jason Ankeny |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/ill-be-there-mt0012600586 |title=I'll Be There - The Jackson 5 &#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review |website=AllMusic |accessdate=October 21, 2013}}</ref> Jackson turned 12 one day after the song was released.\n\nThe most successful single ever released by the Jackson 5, \"I'll Be There\" sold 4.2 million copies in the United States, and 6.1 million copies worldwide. It replaced [[Marvin Gaye]]'s \"[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]\" as the most successful single released on Motown in the U.S., a record it held until the release of [[Lionel Richie]]'s duet with [[Diana Ross]], \"[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]\" (1981). Outside the U.S., \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" remained Motown's biggest-selling record with worldwide sales of over seven million copies.\n\nThe song held the number-one position on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Pop Singles Chart]] for five weeks from October 17 to November 14, replacing \"[[Cracklin' Rosie]]\" by [[Neil Diamond]]; it was succeeded by \"[[I Think I Love You]]\" by [[The Partridge Family]]. \"I'll Be There\" was also a number-one hit on the [[R&B singles chart|''Billboard'' Black Singles Chart]] for six weeks,<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=287}}</ref> and a number 4 hit in the United Kingdom. The single's B-side was \"One More Chance\", a song from their [[ABC (The Jackson 5 album)|second album]].\n\n\"I'll Be There\" was the Jackson 5's final number-one Hot 100 hit as a group. For the rest of their career as a major-label act, Jackson 5 singles would climb no higher than number 2. Michael Jackson scored numerous number-one hits as a solo artist, beginning with \"[[Ben (song)|Ben]]\" in 1972.\n\n===Live performances===\n\"I'll Be There\" remains one of the most popular of the Jackson 5's hits, and has been covered by a number of artists, including [[Josie and the Pussycats (music)|Josie and the Pussycats]] and [[Mariah Carey]], whose cover brought the song back into the public's consciousness two decades after its original release.\n\n\"I'll Be There\" was one of the songs used in the showcase for ''[[Grease: You're the One that I Want!]]''.\n\n[[Andy Williams]] released a version in 1971 on his album, ''[[You've Got a Friend (Andy Williams album)|You've Got a Friend]]''.\n\n[[Willie Hutch]], who was an original co-writer on the song, recorded a version for his 1973 album ''[[Fully Exposed]]''.\n\n[[Green Day]] has frequently performed a live [[Medley (music)|medley]] beginning with their original song \"King For A Day\", morphing into [[The Isley Brothers]]' \"[[Shout (The Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]\" and breaks into a smaller medley including [[The Penguins]]' \"[[Earth Angel]]\", \"I'll Be There\", and [[Ben E. King]]'s \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]\", then back into \"Shout\".\n\nThe song was performed in the \"Jackson 5 medley\" during all of Michael's tours: The [[Bad (tour)|Bad]], [[Dangerous World Tour|Dangerous]] and [[HIStory World Tour|HIStory tours]].\n\nThe song was performed by Michael Jackson in the 2009 film ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]''. However, the song was performed by Jackson and backup singers as if they were the Jackson 5. During the song, clips of the Jackson 5 are shown. At the end of the song, Michael dedicates the song to all of his brothers and his parents.\n\n\"I'll Be There\" was used for a Pepsi commercial during the [[Dangerous World Tour]] in 1992. The commercial featured Michael playing the song on his home piano, remembering the Jackson 5 days until his younger self arrives to sing the song with him. [[Kids Incorporated]] covered \"I'll Be There\" in 1992 in the season 8 episode \"Lay Off\".\n\nIn 2000, the song was recorded by Irish boy band [[Westlife]] on the ''Deluxe Edition'' of their album ''[[Coast to Coast (Westlife album)|Coast to Coast]]''.\n\n===Chart performance===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Weekly singles charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1970\u201371)\n!Peak <br/>position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Australia (''[[Go-Set]]'')<ref name=\"AUSTRALIA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.poparchives.com.au/gosetcharts/1971/19710213.html|title=Go-Set Australian charts - 13 February 1971|publisher=Poparchives.com.au|date=February 13, 1971|accessdate=March 13, 2019}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|31\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Germany ([[GfK Entertainment|Official German Charts]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/titel-details-20292|title=Jackson 5 - I'll Be There|language=German|publisher=[[GfK Entertainment]]|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch40|16|year=1970|week=48|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Ireland2|14|song=I'll Be There|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|New Zealand (''[[New Zealand Listener|Listener]]'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20listener&qartistid=776#n_view_location |title=flavour of new zealand - search listener |website=Flavourofnz.co.nz |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2016}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n{{singlechart|UKsinglesbyname|4|artist=Jackson 5|song=I'll Be There|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=The Jackson 5|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardadultcontemporary|24|artist=The Jackson 5|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardrandbhiphop|1|artist=The Jackson 5|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n!Chart (2009)\n!Peak <br/>position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|60|artist=Jackson 5|song=I'll Be There|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch100|62|artist=Jackson 5|song=I'll Be There|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Switzerland|73|artist=Jackson 5|song=I'll Be There|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|UKsinglesbyname|49|artist=Jackson 5|song=I'll Be There|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Year-end charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1970)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1970.htm |title=Top 100 Hits of 1970/Top 100 Songs of 1970 |website=Musicoutfitters.com |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2016}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1971)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|UK<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-charts.top-source.info/top-100-1971.shtml |title=Top 100 1971 - UK Music Charts |website=Uk-charts.top-source.info |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2016}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n|}\n\n====All-time charts====\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

It was performed as a romantic duet, with Carey singing [[Michael Jackson]]'s lines and R&B singer [[Trey Lorenz]] singing [[Jermaine Jackson]]'s lines. The program and resulting ''[[MTV Unplugged (Mariah Carey EP)|MTV Unplugged]]'' album were produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, who played the piano for the performance. [[Boyz II Men]]'s [[Wanya Morris]] sang the song with Carey in the concert home video, ''[[Fantasy: Mariah Carey at Madison Square Garden]]''.\n\nThe ''MTV Unplugged'' special aired on May 20, 1992, and was a notable success. Carey's label, Columbia Records, received many requests to release \"I'll Be There\" as a single, which had not been planned. A radio edit of the song was created which removed dialogue portions of the performance, and \"I'll Be There\" was released as a single. In the U.S., the song was issued with \"So Blessed\" as a B-side; in the United Kingdom, the \"I'll Be There\" single included the live version of \"[[Vision of Love]]\", and the album versions of \"[[If It's Over]]\" and \"All in Your Mind\".\n\n\"I'll Be There\" was nominated for the 1993 [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] and [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]], losing both categories to [[Boyz II Men]]'s \"[[End of the Road (Boyz II Men song)|End of the Road]]\". The \"I'll Be There\" music video, directed by [[Larry Jordan]], was compiled from footage of Carey's ''MTV Unplugged'' appearance.\n\nDuring [[Michael Jackson memorial service|Michael Jackson's memorial service]] on July 7, 2009, Carey and Lorenz sang their rendition of the song in tribute to Jackson after 17 years of their first performance together.\n\nRegularly, \"I'll Be There\" has been featured on Carey's [[Greatest hits album|catalog]] albums included on ''[[Number 1's (Mariah Carey album)|#1's]]'' (1998), ''[[Greatest Hits (Mariah Carey album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (2001), ''[[The Ballads (Mariah Carey album)|The Ballads]]'' (2008), ''[[The Essential Mariah Carey]]'' (2011), and ''[[Number 1 to Infinity|#1 to Infinity]]'' (2015).\n\n===Critical reception===\n[[AllMusic]] editor Shawn M.

It replaced \"[[Jump (Kris Kross song)|Jump]]\" by [[Kris Kross]], and was itself replaced by \"[[Baby Got Back]]\" by [[Sir Mix-a-Lot]]. It became number-one on the U.S. [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]]. In fact, it is the only single released from the ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' series that hit number-one.\n\n\"I'll Be There\" was Carey's breakthrough hit outside North America, becoming her most successful single in numerous markets.

It's written by [[Berry Gordy]], [[Hal Davis]], Bob West, and [[Willie Hutch]].\n\nThe song was recorded by The Jackson 5 and released by [[Motown Records]] on August 28, 1970 as the first single from their ''[[Third Album]]'' on the same date. Produced by the songwriters, \"I'll Be There\" was The Jackson 5's fourth number-one hit in a row (after \"[[I Want You Back]]\" in 1969, \"[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]]\" and \"[[The Love You Save]]\" earlier in 1970), making them the first black male group to achieve four consecutive number-one pop hits. \"I'll Be There\" is also notable as the most successful single released by Motown during its \"Detroit era\" (1959\u201372).\n\nThe cover version/duet by Mariah Carey and Trey Lorenz was recorded during Carey's appearance on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' in 1992, and released as the first single from her EP ''[[MTV Unplugged (Mariah Carey EP)|MTV Unplugged]]'' in the second quarter of 1992. Co-produced by Carey and [[Walter Afanasieff]], \"I'll Be There\" became Carey's sixth number-one single in the U.S., and her biggest hit elsewhere at the time.\n\n==The Jackson 5 version==\n\n===Release and reaction===\nIn his autobiography ''[[Moon Walk (autobiography)|Moon Walk]]'', Michael Jackson noted that \"I'll Be There\" was the song that solidified The Jackson 5's careers and showed audiences that the group had potential beyond bubblegum pop. Said [[Allmusic]] about the song, \"Rarely, if ever, had one so young sung with so much authority and grace, investing this achingly tender ballad with wisdom and understanding far beyond his years\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Jason Ankeny |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/ill-be-there-mt0012600586 |title=I'll Be There - The Jackson 5 &#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review |website=AllMusic |accessdate=October 21, 2013}}</ref> Jackson turned 12 one day after the song was released.\n\nThe most successful single ever released by the Jackson 5, \"I'll Be There\" sold 4.2 million copies in the United States, and 6.1 million copies worldwide. It replaced [[Marvin Gaye]]'s \"[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]\" as the most successful single released on Motown in the U.S., a record it held until the release of [[Lionel Richie]]'s duet with [[Diana Ross]], \"[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]\" (1981). Outside the U.S., \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" remained Motown's biggest-selling record with worldwide sales of over seven million copies.\n\nThe song held the number-one position on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Pop Singles Chart]] for five weeks from October 17 to November 14, replacing \"[[Cracklin' Rosie]]\" by [[Neil Diamond]]; it was succeeded by \"[[I Think I Love You]]\" by [[The Partridge Family]]. \"I'll Be There\" was also a number-one hit on the [[R&B singles chart|''Billboard'' Black Singles Chart]] for six weeks,<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=287}}</ref> and a number 4 hit in the United Kingdom. The single's B-side was \"One More Chance\", a song from their [[ABC (The Jackson 5 album)|second album]].\n\n\"I'll Be There\" was the Jackson 5's final number-one Hot 100 hit as a group. For the rest of their career as a major-label act, Jackson 5 singles would climb no higher than number 2. Michael Jackson scored numerous number-one hits as a solo artist, beginning with \"[[Ben (song)|Ben]]\" in 1972.\n\n===Live performances===\n\"I'll Be There\" remains one of the most popular of the Jackson 5's hits, and has been covered by a number of artists, including [[Josie and the Pussycats (music)|Josie and the Pussycats]] and [[Mariah Carey]], whose cover brought the song back into the public's consciousness two decades after its original release.\n\n\"I'll Be There\" was one of the songs used in the showcase for ''[[Grease: You're the One that I Want!]]''.\n\n[[Andy Williams]] released a version in 1971 on his album, ''[[You've Got a Friend (Andy Williams album)|You've Got a Friend]]''.\n\n[[Willie Hutch]], who was an original co-writer on the song, recorded a version for his 1973 album ''[[Fully Exposed]]''.\n\n[[Green Day]] has frequently performed a live [[Medley (music)|medley]] beginning with their original song \"King For A Day\", morphing into [[The Isley Brothers]]' \"[[Shout (The Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]\" and breaks into a smaller medley including [[The Penguins]]' \"[[Earth Angel]]\", \"I'll Be There\", and [[Ben E. King]]'s \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]\", then back into \"Shout\".\n\nThe song was performed in the \"Jackson 5 medley\" during all of Michael's tours: The [[Bad (tour)|Bad]], [[Dangerous World Tour|Dangerous]] and [[HIStory World Tour|HIStory tours]].\n\nThe song was performed by Michael Jackson in the 2009 film ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]''. However, the song was performed by Jackson and backup singers as if they were the Jackson 5. During the song, clips of the Jackson 5 are shown. At the end of the song, Michael dedicates the song to all of his brothers and his parents.\n\n\"I'll Be There\" was used for a Pepsi commercial during the [[Dangerous World Tour]] in 1992. The commercial featured Michael playing the song on his home piano, remembering the Jackson 5 days until his younger self arrives to sing the song with him.

It was performed as a romantic duet, with Carey singing [[Michael Jackson]]'s lines and R&B singer [[Trey Lorenz]] singing [[Jermaine Jackson]]'s lines. The program and resulting ''[[MTV Unplugged (Mariah Carey EP)|MTV Unplugged]]'' album were produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, who played the piano for the performance. [[Boyz II Men]]'s [[Wanya Morris]] sang the song with Carey in the concert home video, ''[[Fantasy: Mariah Carey at Madison Square Garden]]''.\n\nThe ''MTV Unplugged'' special aired on May 20, 1992, and was a notable success. Carey's label, Columbia Records, received many requests to release \"I'll Be There\" as a single, which had not been planned. A radio edit of the song was created which removed dialogue portions of the performance, and \"I'll Be There\" was released as a single. In the U.S., the song was issued with \"So Blessed\" as a B-side; in the United Kingdom, the \"I'll Be There\" single included the live version of \"[[Vision of Love]]\", and the album versions of \"[[If It's Over]]\" and \"All in Your Mind\".\n\n\"I'll Be There\" was nominated for the 1993 [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] and [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]], losing both categories to [[Boyz II Men]]'s \"[[End of the Road (Boyz II Men song)|End of the Road]]\". The \"I'll Be There\" music video, directed by [[Larry Jordan]], was compiled from footage of Carey's ''MTV Unplugged'' appearance.\n\nDuring [[Michael Jackson memorial service|Michael Jackson's memorial service]] on July 7, 2009, Carey and Lorenz sang their rendition of the song in tribute to Jackson after 17 years of their first performance together.\n\nRegularly, \"I'll Be There\" has been featured on Carey's [[Greatest hits album|catalog]] albums included on ''[[Number 1's (Mariah Carey album)|#1's]]'' (1998), ''[[Greatest Hits (Mariah Carey album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (2001), ''[[The Ballads (Mariah Carey album)|The Ballads]]'' (2008), ''[[The Essential Mariah Carey]]'' (2011), and ''[[Number 1 to Infinity|#1 to Infinity]]'' (2015).\n\n===Critical reception===\n[[AllMusic]] editor Shawn M.

It replaced \"[[Jump (Kris Kross song)|Jump]]\" by [[Kris Kross]], and was itself replaced by \"[[Baby Got Back]]\" by [[Sir Mix-a-Lot]]. It became number-one on the U.S. [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]]. In fact, it is the only single released from the ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' series that hit number-one.\n\n\"I'll Be There\" was Carey's breakthrough hit outside North America, becoming her most successful single in numerous markets. It topped the [[Canadian Singles Chart]] for two weeks, and became her first number-one single in the [[Netherlands]] for three weeks, and her second in [[New Zealand]] for five weeks. It also became her biggest hit at the time in the United Kingdom (where it hit number 2) and Australia (where it reached number 9). It peaked inside the top 20 in most markets across Europe, where Carey's success had previously been limited.\n\nThe song has sold a total of 345,000 copies in the UK.<ref name=\"uksales\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110606035449/http://www.mtv.co.uk/shows/mtv-official-countdowns/episode/mariah-carey-official-top-20 Mariah Carey official top 20 biggest-selling songs in the UK]  [[MTV]]. retrieved: May 3, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Charts and certifications===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Weekly charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1992)\n!Peak <br />position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Australia|9|artist=Mariah Carey|song=I'll Be There (Unplugged)|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|4|artist=Mariah Carey|song=I'll Be There (Unplugged)|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|1|chartid=2006|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadaadultcontemporary|1|chartid=2004|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canada (''[[The Record (magazine)|The Record]]'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1992/Billboard-1992-07-11.pdf|title=Hits of the World|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 11, 1992|accessdate=June 1, 2015|page=40}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1992/Billboard-1992-08-01.pdf|title=Hits of the World|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=August 1, 1992|accessdate=May 25, 2015|page=39}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n{{singlechart|France|16|artist=Mariah Carey|song=I'll Be There (Unplugged)|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Germany2|33|artist=Mariah Carey|song=I'll Be There (Unplugged)|songid=2478|accessdate=April 14, 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Ireland2|3|song=I'll Be There|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch40|1|year=1992|week=30|accessdate=May 20, 2015|refname=\"MariahDutch40\"}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch100|1|artist=Mariah Carey|song=I'll Be There (Unplugged)|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|New Zealand|1|artist=Mariah Carey|song=I'll Be There (Unplugged)|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Norway|10|artist=Mariah Carey|song=I'll Be There (Unplugged)|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n|Poland ([[Lista Przeboj\u00f3w Programu Trzeciego|LP3]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lp3.polskieradio.pl/notowania/?numer=545|title=Notowania 545|publisher=[[Lista Przeboj\u00f3w Programu Trzeciego|LP3]]|language=Polish|date=July 31, 1992|accessdate=October 29, 2019}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n{{singlechart|Sweden|26|artist=Mariah Carey|song=I'll Be There (Unplugged)|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Switzerland|20|artist=Mariah Carey|song=I'll Be There (Unplugged)|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|UK|2|date=19920704|accessdate=April 14, 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=Mariah Carey|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardadultcontemporary|1|artist=Mariah Carey|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardrandbhiphop|11|artist=Mariah Carey|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Year-end charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1992)\n!Position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Australia (ARIA)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-end-of-year-charts-top-50-singles-1992.htm|title=ARIA Charts -
