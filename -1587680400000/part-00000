It was also named the 2007 Single of the Year by the [[Country Music Association Awards]]. It ranked on CMT's ''40 Greatest Songs of the Decade'' at number 25, along with Underwood's other signature hit, \"[[Jesus, Take the Wheel]]\", which ranked number four.\n\n==Background==\n\"Before He Cheats\" tells the story of a woman taking revenge on her potentially unfaithful boyfriend or husband.\n\nShe imagines him hanging out and flirting with a \"bleach-blonde\" girl, shooting pool, buying her a [[alcoholic beverage|drink]], dancing, and hoping to \"[[sexual intercourse|get lucky]]\" with her. In retaliation, she vandalizes his customized [[four-wheel drive]] vehicle by [[Vandalism|keying]] the sides, carving her name into its leather seats, smashing the headlights with a [[Louisville Slugger]] baseball bat and slashing all four tires. All of these actions are part of her hopes that this will make him \"think before he cheats\" again.\n\nAlthough the song is about a tale of revenge, according to Carrie Underwood, while she had been cheated on before, \"I wouldn't recommend doing any property damage, though. I'm a 'let it go, move on' kind of person.\"<ref name=\"billboard\">{{cite web |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/song-stories/before-he-cheats-carrie-underwood |title=Before He Cheats |work=Billboard }}</ref>\n\n\"Before He Cheats\" is set in the key of [[F-sharp minor]].

The song's main chord pattern is F{{sharp}}m-E-D{{sub|sus}}2-C{{sharp}}m, and Underwood's vocals range from F{{sharp}}3-C{{sharp}}5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0136567|title='Before He Cheats' sheet music|work=musicnotes.com|accessdate=13 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video for \"Before He Cheats\" was directed by [[Roman White]].<ref name=\"cmtvideo\">{{cite web|title=Videos: Carrie Underwood, \"Before He Cheats\"|url=http://www.cmt.com/videos/carrie-underwood/106496/before-he-cheats.jhtml|work=CMT.com|accessdate=2008-02-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080205003936/http://www.cmt.com/videos/carrie-underwood/106496/before-he-cheats.jhtml| archivedate= 5 February 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> In the beginning of the video Underwood is seen leaving a parking lot brandishing a Louisville Slugger, having just vandalized her husband/boyfriend's truck for cheating on her. In other scenes, the \"husband/boyfriend\" (portrayed by actor Tabb Shoup) is seen kissing another woman. As the video progresses Underwood takes the stage to sing as various objects behind her, such as lamps, are seen exploding. At one point, a screen shot of the front seat of the truck is seen with Underwood's name carved in it, which she mentions during the chorus of the song. Eventually, she catches up with her cheating husband/boyfriend with the other woman. After looking shocked for a second, she scoffs and drops the keys to his now-demolished truck into his drink. Towards the end Underwood struts down a street, singing along with the song, while different objects are shown flying across the air, glasses are seen shattering, and light bulbs explode, paying homage to [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]''. At the very end of the music video, the truck is shown completely destroyed.\n\nThe early scenes in the video featuring a crowd in a narrow street and Underwood in a parking garage, were filmed in and around [[Printer's Alley]] in downtown [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The final scene, featuring the exploding glass and light bulbs, was filmed on Fourth Avenue just north of Church Street in Nashville.\n\n\"Before He Cheats\" made [[Great American Country|GAC]] music video history by debuting at number one. It also marks the third consecutive number-one music video on GAC for Underwood. It made history on CMT's Top Twenty Countdown for being at number one for a consecutive five weeks. In December 2006, \"Before He Cheats\" was named the best video of 2006 by CMT's Top 20 Countdown. It also finished number two in GAC's Video of the Year for 2006 behind [[Trace Adkins]]'s \"[[Honky Tonk Badonkadonk]]\". Proving its crossover success, the video made a debut at number 15 on the ''[[VSpot Top 20 Countdown]]'', peaking at number 4.\n\nThe video premiered on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Total Request Live]]'' in April 2007, this is the second country music video to be premiered in this program, the first being \"[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]\" by [[Jessica Simpson]].\n\nOn April 16, 2007, the video for \"Before He Cheats\" swept the [[CMT Music Awards]], winning three categories: Video of the Year, Female Video of the Year, and Director of the Year. Underwood made history by being the first female to win Video of the Year.\n\nThe video also garnered Carrie a nomination for Music Video of the Year at the 2007 [[Country Music Association]] Awards and a nomination for a [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards|2007 MTV Video Music Award]] in the category of Best New Artist.\n\nDuring an ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' telecast of a [[Dallas Cowboys]]-[[New York Giants]] game, the song was played over the Dallas offensive line-up announcements after Underwood broke up with Dallas QB [[Tony Romo]].\n\nThe music video was ranked number nine on CMT's 100 Greatest Videos.<ref>{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Videos |url=http://lounge.teamshania.com/showthread.php?t=6760 |accessdate=2008-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211161533/http://lounge.teamshania.com/showthread.php?t=6760 |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }}</ref>  It also ranked number one on [[Great American Country|GAC]]'s ''Top 50 Videos of the 2000s''.\n\nIn 2009, the music video for the song was voted number one by fans as VH1's Greatest Diva Music Video of all-time, before the airing of the annual VH1 Divas Live special.\n\n==Commercial performance==\n\"Before He Cheats\" first appeared on the charts in February 2006. Although it had not at that point been released as a single, many country stations began giving the song unsolicited airplay, leading it to debut on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart at number 59. By the time the song was officially released as ''Some Hearts''&#39; third single in August of that year, it had already racked up 20 non-consecutive weeks on the chart, reaching as high as number 49. After the official release, the song climbed the country charts quickly, reaching number one in November and remaining there for five weeks. This was Underwood's third consecutive number one country single and fourth number one single overall. It also managed to debut on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart at number 92, and by November it had reached number 16 on that chart. By the end of 2006, the song began to slowly descend the charts, and it had appeared the single had peaked.\n\nHowever, pop radio began to take notice of the song in February 2007, around the time of Underwood's [[Grammy Award]] wins. As the single increased its top 40 airplay, it began to rebound on the Hot 100 chart. The new airplay, along with attention from numerous award show wins for the song, such as favorite country song at the 2007 [[People's Choice Awards]] in January and Video of the Year at the 2007 [[Country Music Television|CMT]]s in April, reinvigorated digital sales as well. When it finally peaked at number 8 in May 2007, it had already logged 38 weeks on the chart, making it the longest-trek to the top 10 ever. As pop airplay began dying down, the song got a third life on the [[adult contemporary]] format, which began playing the song in May. \"Before He Cheats\" spent 64 consecutive weeks on the Hot 100 chart, before finally falling off in late November 2007. The song is one of the longest-charting hits in ''Billboard'' history, and was the third longest-running hit of the 2000s decade.\n\n\"Before He Cheats\" was ranked sixth on the 2007 Hot 100 Year-end chart and fifth on the 2007 Hot 100 Airplay Year-end chart by ''Billboard''. It was also ranked tenth on the 2007 Adult Contemporary Year-end chart.\n\nThe song sold over two million in digital sales in December 2007, and was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in February 2008, making it the first country song to achieve this feat.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/chart-watch-maroon-5-beats-coldplay-211508183.html |title=Chart Watch: Maroon 5 Beats Coldplay |author= Paul Grein |work=Chart Watch (Yahoo Music) |date=June 25, 2014}}</ref> It was the best-selling single from an ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant until [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s \"[[Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)]]\" surpassed it in the spring of 2012, and is still Underwood's best-selling single to date.

It ranked on CMT's ''40 Greatest Songs of the Decade'' at number 25, along with Underwood's other signature hit, \"[[Jesus, Take the Wheel]]\", which ranked number four.\n\n==Background==\n\"Before He Cheats\" tells the story of a woman taking revenge on her potentially unfaithful boyfriend or husband.\n\nShe imagines him hanging out and flirting with a \"bleach-blonde\" girl, shooting pool, buying her a [[alcoholic beverage|drink]], dancing, and hoping to \"[[sexual intercourse|get lucky]]\" with her. In retaliation, she vandalizes his customized [[four-wheel drive]] vehicle by [[Vandalism|keying]] the sides, carving her name into its leather seats, smashing the headlights with a [[Louisville Slugger]] baseball bat and slashing all four tires. All of these actions are part of her hopes that this will make him \"think before he cheats\" again.\n\nAlthough the song is about a tale of revenge, according to Carrie Underwood, while she had been cheated on before, \"I wouldn't recommend doing any property damage, though. I'm a 'let it go, move on' kind of person.\"<ref name=\"billboard\">{{cite web |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/song-stories/before-he-cheats-carrie-underwood |title=Before He Cheats |work=Billboard }}</ref>\n\n\"Before He Cheats\" is set in the key of [[F-sharp minor]].

In other scenes, the \"husband/boyfriend\" (portrayed by actor Tabb Shoup) is seen kissing another woman. As the video progresses Underwood takes the stage to sing as various objects behind her, such as lamps, are seen exploding. At one point, a screen shot of the front seat of the truck is seen with Underwood's name carved in it, which she mentions during the chorus of the song. Eventually, she catches up with her cheating husband/boyfriend with the other woman. After looking shocked for a second, she scoffs and drops the keys to his now-demolished truck into his drink. Towards the end Underwood struts down a street, singing along with the song, while different objects are shown flying across the air, glasses are seen shattering, and light bulbs explode, paying homage to [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]''. At the very end of the music video, the truck is shown completely destroyed.\n\nThe early scenes in the video featuring a crowd in a narrow street and Underwood in a parking garage, were filmed in and around [[Printer's Alley]] in downtown [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The final scene, featuring the exploding glass and light bulbs, was filmed on Fourth Avenue just north of Church Street in Nashville.\n\n\"Before He Cheats\" made [[Great American Country|GAC]] music video history by debuting at number one. It also marks the third consecutive number-one music video on GAC for Underwood. It made history on CMT's Top Twenty Countdown for being at number one for a consecutive five weeks. In December 2006, \"Before He Cheats\" was named the best video of 2006 by CMT's Top 20 Countdown. It also finished number two in GAC's Video of the Year for 2006 behind [[Trace Adkins]]'s \"[[Honky Tonk Badonkadonk]]\". Proving its crossover success, the video made a debut at number 15 on the ''[[VSpot Top 20 Countdown]]'', peaking at number 4.\n\nThe video premiered on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Total Request Live]]'' in April 2007, this is the second country music video to be premiered in this program, the first being \"[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]\" by [[Jessica Simpson]].\n\nOn April 16, 2007, the video for \"Before He Cheats\" swept the [[CMT Music Awards]], winning three categories: Video of the Year, Female Video of the Year, and Director of the Year. Underwood made history by being the first female to win Video of the Year.\n\nThe video also garnered Carrie a nomination for Music Video of the Year at the 2007 [[Country Music Association]] Awards and a nomination for a [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards|2007 MTV Video Music Award]] in the category of Best New Artist.\n\nDuring an ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' telecast of a [[Dallas Cowboys]]-[[New York Giants]] game, the song was played over the Dallas offensive line-up announcements after Underwood broke up with Dallas QB [[Tony Romo]].\n\nThe music video was ranked number nine on CMT's 100 Greatest Videos.<ref>{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Videos |url=http://lounge.teamshania.com/showthread.php?t=6760 |accessdate=2008-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211161533/http://lounge.teamshania.com/showthread.php?t=6760 |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }}</ref>  It also ranked number one on [[Great American Country|GAC]]'s ''Top 50 Videos of the 2000s''.\n\nIn 2009, the music video for the song was voted number one by fans as VH1's Greatest Diva Music Video of all-time, before the airing of the annual VH1 Divas Live special.\n\n==Commercial performance==\n\"Before He Cheats\" first appeared on the charts in February 2006. Although it had not at that point been released as a single, many country stations began giving the song unsolicited airplay, leading it to debut on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart at number 59. By the time the song was officially released as ''Some Hearts''&#39; third single in August of that year, it had already racked up 20 non-consecutive weeks on the chart, reaching as high as number 49. After the official release, the song climbed the country charts quickly, reaching number one in November and remaining there for five weeks. This was Underwood's third consecutive number one country single and fourth number one single overall. It also managed to debut on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart at number 92, and by November it had reached number 16 on that chart. By the end of 2006, the song began to slowly descend the charts, and it had appeared the single had peaked.\n\nHowever, pop radio began to take notice of the song in February 2007, around the time of Underwood's [[Grammy Award]] wins. As the single increased its top 40 airplay, it began to rebound on the Hot 100 chart. The new airplay, along with attention from numerous award show wins for the song, such as favorite country song at the 2007 [[People's Choice Awards]] in January and Video of the Year at the 2007 [[Country Music Television|CMT]]s in April, reinvigorated digital sales as well. When it finally peaked at number 8 in May 2007, it had already logged 38 weeks on the chart, making it the longest-trek to the top 10 ever. As pop airplay began dying down, the song got a third life on the [[adult contemporary]] format, which began playing the song in May. \"Before He Cheats\" spent 64 consecutive weeks on the Hot 100 chart, before finally falling off in late November 2007. The song is one of the longest-charting hits in ''Billboard'' history, and was the third longest-running hit of the 2000s decade.\n\n\"Before He Cheats\" was ranked sixth on the 2007 Hot 100 Year-end chart and fifth on the 2007 Hot 100 Airplay Year-end chart by ''Billboard''. It was also ranked tenth on the 2007 Adult Contemporary Year-end chart.\n\nThe song sold over two million in digital sales in December 2007, and was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in February 2008, making it the first country song to achieve this feat.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/chart-watch-maroon-5-beats-coldplay-211508183.html |title=Chart Watch: Maroon 5 Beats Coldplay |author= Paul Grein |work=Chart Watch (Yahoo Music) |date=June 25, 2014}}</ref> It was the best-selling single from an ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant until [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s \"[[Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)]]\" surpassed it in the spring of 2012, and is still Underwood's best-selling single to date.

She was introduced in 1999's ''[[Dead or Alive 2]]'' as a French opera singer seeking to avenge her mother's murder. Due to her blood relation to [[Fame Douglas]], the original head of the antagonistic organization behind the ''Dead or Alive'' fighting tournaments, she has become a key character in the franchise, including serving as the [[protagonist]] of ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===In video games===\n{{update section|date=March 2019}}\n\nHelena Douglas is the [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] daughter of [[Fame Douglas]] and his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], a French [[soprano]] named Maria. Seemingly distant from her father, Helena was hardly affected by his assassination after the first Dead or Alive, and instead followed in her mother's footsteps by becoming a successful opera singer in her own right. However, she herself is targeted in an attempted [[Contract killing|hit]] during one of her performances, but Maria spots the assassin's sniper rifle at the last second and intentionally takes the fatal bullet intended for her daughter, leaving Helena alone and seeking vengeance.\n\nShe officially debuts in ''[[Dead or Alive 2]]'' (1999), where, while searching for the killer, she discovers that her parents' deaths and the attempt on her own life are connected to the Dead or Alive (DOA) World Combat Championship, and enters the tournament to discover the truth. Although never explained in the series, Helena appears to have learned or known information pertaining to the Dead or Alive Tournament Executive Committee (DOATEC), especially after encountering an amnesiac contestant named [[Hayate (Dead or Alive)|Hayate]]. Helena implicates [[Ayane (Dead or Alive)|Ayane]] as her mother's assassin, an accusation Ayane neither confirms nor denies, which causes a fight to break out between them.\n\nHelena returns for ''[[Dead or Alive 3]]'' (2001), and is captured by antagonist [[Victor Donovan]] and imprisoned.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gantayat |first=Anoop |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/12/02/dead-or-alive-4-the-characters |title=Dead or Alive 4: The Characters - IGN |work=uk.ign.com |date=2005-12-02 |accessdate=2015-06-18}}</ref> Although Helena insists that she has no ties to DOATEC, Donovan declares that her freedom and the revelation of the truth behind DOATEC\u2014her father having been the head of the organization prior to his death\u2014hinges on her winning the third tournament. In the meantime, Donovan assigns [[Christie (Dead or Alive)|Christie]] to keep an eye on her, with orders to kill her if necessary. However, when confronted by Helena, Christie admits that she is an assassin sent to terminate her.\n\nHelena takes over as new chairperson of DOATEC in 2005's ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]'', in which she is the [[main protagonist]]. She hires the assassin [[Bayman]] to take out Donovan, a job he declines. When the DOATEC Tritower comes under attack by the Mugen Tenshin ninja clan, Helena meets [[Lisa Hamilton|Lisa]], who admits she tricked the clan into attacking in order to stop Donovan. She later discovers that she and [[Kokoro (Dead or Alive)|Kokoro]] are blood-related, as her mother Miyako had been one of Fame Douglas' mistresses. Helena learns the truth about Christie and they meet in battle, the result of which is unknown, save for the fact that they both survive. In her arcade ending, Helena elects to go down with DOATEC by activating the building's self-destruct mechanism.\n\nIn ''[[Dead or Alive 5]]'' (2012), a distressed Helena reflects on the deaths of Maria and another of her father's past lovers, Anna. As Ayane, Hayate, and [[Ryu Hayabusa]] are detonating the DOATEC headquarters, Helena elects to give up her life in the flames of the wreckage before [[Zack (Dead or Alive)|Zack]] arrives in a helicopter to rescue her. With Zack's help,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamesurf.tiscali.it/news/trama-e-foto-per-dead-or-alive-5-c44114.html |title=Trama e foto per Dead or Alive 5 - Gamesurf.it |website=Gamesurf.tiscali.it |date= |accessdate=2016-02-06}}</ref> she becomes the leader of the newly reformed DOATEC and announces the revival of the ''Dead or Alive'' tournaments,<ref name=\"siliconera\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/08/11/team-ninjas-dead-or-alive-5-chart-shows-character-relationships/|title=Team Ninja's ''Dead or Alive 5'' Chart Shows Character Relationships|first=Ishaan|last=Sahdev|work=Siliconera.com|date= August 11, 2012|accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref> then enlists Hayate and Ayane to help [[Kasumi (Dead or Alive)|Kasumi]] on the latter's mission of destroying an army of evil clones of herself, though Helena was unaware that Kasumi she saw was actually a clone, until the real Kasumi joins the fray in the final battle.\n\n''[[Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate]]'' introduced Helena's loyal maid servant [[Marie Rose (Dead or Alive)|Marie Rose]], whom Helena send her to keep an eye on a young scholar fighter who was introduced in ''[[Dead or Alive 5 Last Round]]'' named Honoka in ''[[Dead or Alive 6]]'', realizing that MIST will kidnap her upon witnessing a familiar phenomenal power within Honoka in the day when the said young fighter was disqualified in the fifth tournament\u2019s Asian qualifier match. As Hayate met [[Rig (Dead or Alive)|Rig]] shortly at the night after the fifth tournament ended in the same time Helena set self-destruct DiG where MIST been hiding, but not in another way it seems, Helena realize something tragically happened to Rig, not even Rig aware what happened after his \u201chome\u201d was destroyed and begin to live at [[Bass Armstrong]]\u2019s apartment in New York. Although Lisa manage to survive the explosion at MIST\u2019s first hideout on DiG, Helena tried to object Lisa from keeping herself take a risk to end Donovan\u2019s terror, but realize the latter has a point on not wasting time to let a madman like Donovan get away from his crimes. When Kokoro found out her connection with their late-biological father Fame, Helena got into an argument with her half-sister over their illegitimate family, until Zack manage to calm down the situation, much to Helena\u2019s relieve. As Marie, Bayman and the ninjas finally found MIST\u2019s second hideout in the same time after Honoka and Ayane\u2019s biological evil father [[Raidou (Dead or Alive)|Raidou]] was revived as an undead cyber nukenin, Helena confronts the young scientist who led a resurrection project behind Raidou\u2019s revival, NiCO, who also revived Helena\u2019s late-mother Maria off-screen.

Throughout the movie, Helena is treated as a necessary annoyance by tournament organizer Donovan ([[Eric Roberts]]), who has gained control of DOATEC after the death of Helena's father.

She was introduced in 1999's ''[[Dead or Alive 2]]'' as a French opera singer seeking to avenge her mother's murder. Due to her blood relation to [[Fame Douglas]], the original head of the antagonistic organization behind the ''Dead or Alive'' fighting tournaments, she has become a key character in the franchise, including serving as the [[protagonist]] of ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===In video games===\n{{update section|date=March 2019}}\n\nHelena Douglas is the [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] daughter of [[Fame Douglas]] and his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], a French [[soprano]] named Maria. Seemingly distant from her father, Helena was hardly affected by his assassination after the first Dead or Alive, and instead followed in her mother's footsteps by becoming a successful opera singer in her own right. However, she herself is targeted in an attempted [[Contract killing|hit]] during one of her performances, but Maria spots the assassin's sniper rifle at the last second and intentionally takes the fatal bullet intended for her daughter, leaving Helena alone and seeking vengeance.\n\nShe officially debuts in ''[[Dead or Alive 2]]'' (1999), where, while searching for the killer, she discovers that her parents' deaths and the attempt on her own life are connected to the Dead or Alive (DOA) World Combat Championship, and enters the tournament to discover the truth. Although never explained in the series, Helena appears to have learned or known information pertaining to the Dead or Alive Tournament Executive Committee (DOATEC), especially after encountering an amnesiac contestant named [[Hayate (Dead or Alive)|Hayate]]. Helena implicates [[Ayane (Dead or Alive)|Ayane]] as her mother's assassin, an accusation Ayane neither confirms nor denies, which causes a fight to break out between them.\n\nHelena returns for ''[[Dead or Alive 3]]'' (2001), and is captured by antagonist [[Victor Donovan]] and imprisoned.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gantayat |first=Anoop |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/12/02/dead-or-alive-4-the-characters |title=Dead or Alive 4: The Characters - IGN |work=uk.ign.com |date=2005-12-02 |accessdate=2015-06-18}}</ref> Although Helena insists that she has no ties to DOATEC, Donovan declares that her freedom and the revelation of the truth behind DOATEC\u2014her father having been the head of the organization prior to his death\u2014hinges on her winning the third tournament. In the meantime, Donovan assigns [[Christie (Dead or Alive)|Christie]] to keep an eye on her, with orders to kill her if necessary. However, when confronted by Helena, Christie admits that she is an assassin sent to terminate her.\n\nHelena takes over as new chairperson of DOATEC in 2005's ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]'', in which she is the [[main protagonist]]. She hires the assassin [[Bayman]] to take out Donovan, a job he declines. When the DOATEC Tritower comes under attack by the Mugen Tenshin ninja clan, Helena meets [[Lisa Hamilton|Lisa]], who admits she tricked the clan into attacking in order to stop Donovan. She later discovers that she and [[Kokoro (Dead or Alive)|Kokoro]] are blood-related, as her mother Miyako had been one of Fame Douglas' mistresses. Helena learns the truth about Christie and they meet in battle, the result of which is unknown, save for the fact that they both survive. In her arcade ending, Helena elects to go down with DOATEC by activating the building's self-destruct mechanism.\n\nIn ''[[Dead or Alive 5]]'' (2012), a distressed Helena reflects on the deaths of Maria and another of her father's past lovers, Anna.

When Kokoro found out her connection with their late-biological father Fame, Helena got into an argument with her half-sister over their illegitimate family, until Zack manage to calm down the situation, much to Helena\u2019s relieve.

The scientists said that obtaining well-preserved, uncontaminated DNA from mummies has been a problem for the field and that these samples provided \"the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians using high-throughput DNA sequencing methods\". The specimens represented a period stretching from the late [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] to the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman era]] (1388 BCE\u2013426 CE). Complete [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) sequences were obtained for 90 of the mummies and were compared with each other and with several other ancient and modern datasets. The scientists found that the ancient Egyptian individuals in their own dataset possessed highly similar mitochondrial profiles throughout the examined period. Modern Egyptians generally shared this maternal haplogroup pattern, but also carried more African clades. However, analysis of the mummies' mtDNA haplogroups found that they shared greater mitochondrial affinities with modern populations from the Near East and the Levant compared to modern Egyptians. Additionally, three of the ancient Egyptian individuals were analysed for Y-DNA, and were observed to bear paternal lineages that are common in both the Middle East and North Africa. The researchers cautioned that the affinities of the examined ancient Egyptian specimens may not be representative of those of all ancient Egyptians since they were from a single archaeological site.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schuenemann|first1=Verena|last2=Peltzer|first2=Alexander|last3=Welte|first3=Beatrix|title=Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|pages=15694|date=30 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ncomms15694|pmid=28556824|pmc=5459999}}</ref>\n\n==Anthropometric indicators==\n=== Craniofacial criteria===\n[[File:Unknown egyptian skull.JPG|thumb|250px|An Ancient Egyptian skull, thought to be that of [[Akhenaten]].]]\nThe use of craniofacial criteria as reliable indicators of population grouping or ethnicity has been a longstanding focus of biological anthropology.

An assessment of \"race\" is as useless as it is impossible. Neither clines nor clusters alone suffice to deal with the biological nature of a widely distributed population. Both must be used.\" He also commented, \"We conclude that the Egyptians have been in place since back in the [[Pleistocene]] and have been largely unaffected by either invasions or migrations. As others have noted, Egyptians are Egyptians, and they were so in the past as well.\"<ref name=Brace1993/> [[Joseph Deniker]] and other early anthropologists similarly noted that the overall cranial form of Ethiopid, Near Eastern Semitic and Berber ethnic groups, all of whom speak Hamito-Semitic languages, are largely the same.<ref>\"The races of man: an outline of anthropology and ethnography\", by Joseph Deniker, pg 432</ref><ref>\"Papers on inter-racial problems\", by Gustav Spiller, pg 24</ref>\n\n====Modern and ancient Egyptians====\nEgyptologist Barry Kemp (2005) has reviewed the available skulls and skeletal evidence on the ancient Egyptians. He observes that skeletons from earlier periods, which would help elucidate the origin of the [[Predynastic Egypt]]ians, are rare, with one of the few examples being bodies recovered from a Late Stone Age cemetery at Gebel Sahaba, in the northern [[Sudan]]. Kemp states that these people certainly would not have looked like Predynastic Egyptians or Nubians, but instead they shared features with a population of early ''Homo sapiens'' called [[Cro-Magnon]], which are found spread across North Africa and Europe.<ref name=\"Ancient Egypt 2007, pages 46-58\">{{cite book |last=Kemp |first=Barry J. |author-link=Barry J.

He notes that there is no single ancient Egyptian population to study, but rather a diversity of local populations. He notes also that Predynastic skulls from Upper Egypt appear to be noticeably different in their measurements from an Old Kingdom group from tombs around the pyramids of Giza, and one investigator{{who|date=October 2018}} has consequently claimed that \u2018the pyramid builders were a different race from the people whose descendants they had hitherto been supposed to be\u2019.<ref name=\"Ancient Egypt 2007, pages 46-58\"/>\n\nKemp cautions that the features of individuals within a population can be expected to display a degree of variation which can be quite wide and which may overlap with that present in a different population, and that characteristics change over time. He states that the samples available for study are \"microscopically small\", and \"are only a tiny, sad and unrepresentative remnant\" of the approximately 200,000,000 people who lived in Egypt over the 4,000 years of that civilization\u2019s history. In particular he notes that these analyses are dominated by sampling bias, in that bones from the northern regions are rare, while bones are much better preserved in the dry deserts of the south (next to Nubia), and that these items thus make up a disproportionate proportion of the available samples.<ref name=\"Ancient Egypt 2007, pages 46-58\"/>\n\nKemp argues that the black/white argument, though politically understandable, is an oversimplification that hinders an appropriate evaluation of the scientific data on the ancient Egyptians since it does not take into consideration the difficulty in ascertaining complexion from skeletal remains. It also ignores the fact that Africa is inhabited by many other populations besides Bantu-related (\"Negroid\") groups. He asserts that in reconstructions of life in ancient Egypt, ''modern Egyptians'' would therefore be the most logical and closest approximation to the ''ancient Egyptians''.<ref name=\"Ancient Egypt 2007, pages 46-58\"/>\n\nAnthropologist Nancy Lovell states the following:\n{{quote|\"There is now a sufficient body of evidence from modern studies of skeletal remains to indicate that the ancient Egyptians, especially southern Egyptians, exhibited physical characteristics that are within the range of variation for ancient and modern indigenous peoples of the [[Sahara]] and tropical Africa. The distribution of population characteristics seems to follow a clinal pattern from south to north, which may be explained by natural selection as well as gene flow between neighboring populations. In general, the inhabitants of Upper Egypt and Nubia had the greatest biological affinity to people of the Sahara and more southerly areas.\"\n\n\"must be placed in the context of hypotheses informed by archaeological, linguistic, geographic and other data. In such contexts, the physical anthropological evidence indicates that early Nile Valley populations can be identified as part of an African lineage, but exhibiting local variation.

The scientists said that obtaining well-preserved, uncontaminated DNA from mummies has been a problem for the field and that these samples provided \"the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians using high-throughput DNA sequencing methods\". The specimens represented a period stretching from the late [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] to the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman era]] (1388 BCE\u2013426 CE). Complete [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) sequences were obtained for 90 of the mummies and were compared with each other and with several other ancient and modern datasets. The scientists found that the ancient Egyptian individuals in their own dataset possessed highly similar mitochondrial profiles throughout the examined period. Modern Egyptians generally shared this maternal haplogroup pattern, but also carried more African clades. However, analysis of the mummies' mtDNA haplogroups found that they shared greater mitochondrial affinities with modern populations from the Near East and the Levant compared to modern Egyptians. Additionally, three of the ancient Egyptian individuals were analysed for Y-DNA, and were observed to bear paternal lineages that are common in both the Middle East and North Africa.

Loring Brace]] et al. (1993) concluded that the Predynastic Egyptians of Upper Egypt and the Late Dynastic Egyptians of Lower Egypt were most closely related to each other. They also showed general ties with other Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in North Africa, Neolithic and modern [[Europeans]], and [[Indian people]], but not at all with populations of [[sub-Saharan Africa]], [[Eastern Asia]], [[Oceania]], or the [[Americas]].<!-- Brace's sub-Saharan samples were culled from western & eastern areas http://oi67.tinypic.com/jfxiiu.jpg --> \"Adjacent people in the Nile valley show similarities in trivial traits in an unbroken series from the delta in the north southward through Nubia and all the way to Somalia at the equator. At the same time, the gradient in skin color and body proportions suggests long-term adaptive response to selective forces appropriate to the latitude where they occur. An assessment of \"race\" is as useless as it is impossible. Neither clines nor clusters alone suffice to deal with the biological nature of a widely distributed population. Both must be used.\" He also commented, \"We conclude that the Egyptians have been in place since back in the [[Pleistocene]] and have been largely unaffected by either invasions or migrations. As others have noted, Egyptians are Egyptians, and they were so in the past as well.\"<ref name=Brace1993/> [[Joseph Deniker]] and other early anthropologists similarly noted that the overall cranial form of Ethiopid, Near Eastern Semitic and Berber ethnic groups, all of whom speak Hamito-Semitic languages, are largely the same.<ref>\"The races of man: an outline of anthropology and ethnography\", by Joseph Deniker, pg 432</ref><ref>\"Papers on inter-racial problems\", by Gustav Spiller, pg 24</ref>\n\n====Modern and ancient Egyptians====\nEgyptologist Barry Kemp (2005) has reviewed the available skulls and skeletal evidence on the ancient Egyptians. He observes that skeletons from earlier periods, which would help elucidate the origin of the [[Predynastic Egypt]]ians, are rare, with one of the few examples being bodies recovered from a Late Stone Age cemetery at Gebel Sahaba, in the northern [[Sudan]]. Kemp states that these people certainly would not have looked like Predynastic Egyptians or Nubians, but instead they shared features with a population of early ''Homo sapiens'' called [[Cro-Magnon]], which are found spread across North Africa and Europe.<ref name=\"Ancient Egypt 2007, pages 46-58\">{{cite book |last=Kemp |first=Barry J. |author-link=Barry J.

He notes that there is no single ancient Egyptian population to study, but rather a diversity of local populations. He notes also that Predynastic skulls from Upper Egypt appear to be noticeably different in their measurements from an Old Kingdom group from tombs around the pyramids of Giza, and one investigator{{who|date=October 2018}} has consequently claimed that \u2018the pyramid builders were a different race from the people whose descendants they had hitherto been supposed to be\u2019.<ref name=\"Ancient Egypt 2007, pages 46-58\"/>\n\nKemp cautions that the features of individuals within a population can be expected to display a degree of variation which can be quite wide and which may overlap with that present in a different population, and that characteristics change over time. He states that the samples available for study are \"microscopically small\", and \"are only a tiny, sad and unrepresentative remnant\" of the approximately 200,000,000 people who lived in Egypt over the 4,000 years of that civilization\u2019s history. In particular he notes that these analyses are dominated by sampling bias, in that bones from the northern regions are rare, while bones are much better preserved in the dry deserts of the south (next to Nubia), and that these items thus make up a disproportionate proportion of the available samples.<ref name=\"Ancient Egypt 2007, pages 46-58\"/>\n\nKemp argues that the black/white argument, though politically understandable, is an oversimplification that hinders an appropriate evaluation of the scientific data on the ancient Egyptians since it does not take into consideration the difficulty in ascertaining complexion from skeletal remains. It also ignores the fact that Africa is inhabited by many other populations besides Bantu-related (\"Negroid\") groups. He asserts that in reconstructions of life in ancient Egypt, ''modern Egyptians'' would therefore be the most logical and closest approximation to the ''ancient Egyptians''.<ref name=\"Ancient Egypt 2007, pages 46-58\"/>\n\nAnthropologist Nancy Lovell states the following:\n{{quote|\"There is now a sufficient body of evidence from modern studies of skeletal remains to indicate that the ancient Egyptians, especially southern Egyptians, exhibited physical characteristics that are within the range of variation for ancient and modern indigenous peoples of the [[Sahara]] and tropical Africa. The distribution of population characteristics seems to follow a clinal pattern from south to north, which may be explained by natural selection as well as gene flow between neighboring populations. In general, the inhabitants of Upper Egypt and Nubia had the greatest biological affinity to people of the Sahara and more southerly areas.\"\n\n\"must be placed in the context of hypotheses informed by archaeological, linguistic, geographic and other data. In such contexts, the physical anthropological evidence indicates that early Nile Valley populations can be identified as part of an African lineage, but exhibiting local variation. This variation represents the short- and long-term effects of evolutionary forces, such as gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection, influenced by culture and geography.\"<ref>Nancy C.

Both of these fossil series possessed Middle Eastern affinities and were distinct from the analyzed prehistoric crania of North Africa and the Horn region, including the Pleistocene [[Rabat]] skull, Herto ''[[Homo sapiens idaltu]]'' fossil and Early Holocene Kef Oum Touiza skeleton. The scientists suggest that this may indicate that the Afroasiatic-speaking groups settled in the area during a later epoch, having possibly arrived from the Middle East.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Terrazas Mata, A.

The government officials were ranked in 18 levels, ranging from senior first rank (jeong-il-pum, [[Hangul]]: \uc8151\ud488, [[Hanja]]: \u6b63\u4e00\u54c1) down to junior ninth rank (jong-gu-pum, [[Hangul|\uc8859\ud488]], [[Hanja|\u5f9e\u4e5d\u54c1]]) based on seniority and promotion, which was achieved through the royal decree based on examinations and recommendations.\n\nThe power of the bureaucrats often eclipsed that of the central authorities, including the monarch. For much of the dynasty, a complex system of checks and balances prevented any one section of the government from gaining overwhelming power until the 19th century when political power became concentrated in a certain family or individual.\n\n==Government==\n\n===The king===\nThe king ruled for life, unlike any of his appointees. The kings of Joseon were all of the [[Jeonju Yi clan]] and notionally descended from [[Taejo of Joseon|Taejo]], although some were adopted. For a list of Joseon kings, see [[List of Korean monarchs]]. Under Confucian philosophy, the king commanded absolute loyalty from his officials and subjects, but the officials were also expected to try to guide the king to the right path if the latter was mistaken. Natural disasters were thought to be due to the king's failings, and therefore, Joseon kings were very sensitive to their occurrences.\n\n===Civil service===\nIn order to serve in the positions of responsibility outside the military in [[Joseon Dynasty]], one had to take a series of  [[gwageo]] literary examinations and pass each of them (usually four to five times). Theoretically, any male other than [[cheonmin]] (lowest class) and children of concubines could take [[gwageo]] examinations to enter a civil service and thus become [[yangban]] (nobility class).  In actuality, only the [[yangban]] class had the luxury of time and money as well as the necessary connections to pass [[gwageo]] exams. In addition, people from the troublesome northern provinces of [[Hamgyeong]] and [[Pyeongan]] were barred from office for much of the dynasty.\n\nOfficials served in positions for fixed terms, varying from one year to five years. A successful official might serve in tens of positions in the course of a career.\n\n===State council===\n{{main article|State Council of Joseon}}\n\n[[State Council of Joseon|State Council]] (Uijeongbu, [[Hangul]]: \uc758\uc815\ubd80, [[Hanja]]: \u8b70\u653f\u5e9c) was the highest deliberative body of the Joseon Dynasty although it faded in importance after first centuries of rule. It was composed of twelve officials. The Chief State Councillor ([[Yeonguijeong]], \uc601\uc758\uc815, \u9818\u8b70\u653f), Left State Councillor ([[Jwauijeong]], \uc88c\uc758\uc815), and Right State Councillor (Uuijeong, \uc6b0\uc758\uc815) were the highest-ranking officials in the government (senior first rank). They were assisted by Left Minister (Jwachanseong, \uc88c\ucc2c\uc131) and Right Minister (Uichangseong, \uc6b0\ucc2c\uc131), both of junior first rank, and seven lower ranking officials. The power of State Council was inversely proportional to the king's power. Sometimes it directly controlled [[Six Ministries of Joseon|Six Ministries]], the chief executive body of Joseon government, but primarily served in advisory role under stronger kings. State councillors served in several other positions including a tutor to the crown prince.\n\n===Six Ministries===\n{{main article|Six Ministries of Joseon}}\n\nThe [[Six Ministries of Joseon|Six Ministries]] (Yukjo, [[Hangul]]: \uc721\uc870, [[Hanja]]: \u516d\u66f9) were the chief executive body of [[Joseon]]. Each Minister (Panseo, \ud310\uc11c) was of senior second rank (2a, third highest rank) and was assisted by a Deputy-Minister (Champan, \ucc38\ud310) of junior second rank (2b, fourth highest rank) and a Secretary (Chamui, \ucc38\uc758) of rank 3a. Apart from these three Dangsanggwan (\ub2f9\uc0c1\uad00, \u5802\u4e0a\u5b98) officials, each Ministry was headed by three Jeongrang (\uc815\ub791, rank 5a) and three Jwarang (\uc88c\ub791, rank 6a), adding to nine officials ranked 6a or above.\n\n*Ministry of Personnel (Ijo, \uc774\uc870, \u540f\u66f9) \u2013 was primarily concerned with appointment of officials\n*Ministry of Taxation (Hojo, \ud638\uc870, \u6236\u66f9) \u2013 taxation, finances, census, agriculture, and land policies\n*Ministry of Rites (Yejo, \uc608\uc870, \u79ae\u66f9) \u2013 rituals, culture, diplomacy, gwageo\n*[[Ministry of Defence|Ministry of National Defense (South Korea)]] (Byeongjo, \ubcd1\uc870, \u5175\u66f9) \u2013 military affairs\n*Ministry of Justice (Hyeongjo, \ud615\uc870, \u5211\u66f9) \u2013 administration of law, slavery, punishments\n*Ministry of Works (Gongjo, \uacf5\uc870, \u5de5\u66f9) \u2013 industry, public works, manufacturing, mining\n\n===Three Offices===\n{{main article|Three offices of Joseon}}\n\n[[Three Offices]] (Samsa, [[Hangul]]: \uc0bc\uc0ac, [[Hanja]]: \u4e09\u53f8) is a collective name for three offices that provided checks and balance on the king and the officials. The officials who served in these offices tended to be younger and of lower rank compared to other offices but enjoyed special privileges and prestige. They went through more thorough review of moral character and family background.   \n*Office of Inspector General (Saheonbu, \uc0ac\ud5cc\ubd80, \u53f8\u61b2\u5e9c) - It monitored government administration and officials in both central and local governments for corruption or incompetence. It was run by 30 officials including Inspector General (Daesaheon, \ub300\uc0ac\ud5cc), a position of junior second rank.\n*Office of Censors (Saganwon, \uc0ac\uac04\uc6d0, \u53f8\u8aeb\u9662) - Its chief function was to remonstrate with the king if there was wrong or improper action or policy.  It also impeached corrupt officials and spoke opinions about the general state of affairs.  It was composed of five officials, led by Chief Censor (Daesagan, \ub300\uc0ac\uac04), of senior third rank.  Its function as organ of speech often overlapped with Office of Inspector General, and they sometimes submitted joint petition to the king.\n*Office of Special Advisors (Hongmoongwan, \ud64d\ubb38\uad00, \u5f18\u6587\u9928) - It oversaw the royal library and served as research institute to study Confucian philosophy and answer the king's questions. It was composed of 21 officials, but its three highest officials were ministers serving in State Council and the actual head of the office was Deputy Chief Scholar (Bujehak, \ubd80\uc81c\ud559), a position of senior third rank.  Its officials took part in the daily lessons called ''kyeongyeon''(\uacbd\uc5f0), in which they discussed Confucian philosophy with the king.  These discussions often led to comments on current political issues, and these officials had significant influence as advisors. (It was established to replace [[Hall of Worthies]] (Jiphyeonjeon, \uc9d1\ud604\uc804, \u96c6\u8ce2\u6bbf) after the latter was abolished by [[Sejo of Joseon|King Sejo]] in the aftermath of [[Six martyred ministers]].)\n\nThe Samsa provided a key check on the powers of the other branches of government. The Inspector-General and Censor-General had the unique power to vet potential appointees for all positions, and examine their family backgrounds.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 176.</ref> They thus played a role in maintaining the integrity of the yangban aristocracy.\n\n===Other Offices===\n*Royal Secretariat (Seungjeongwon, \uc2b9\uc815\uc6d0, \u627f\u653f\u9662) - It served as a liaison between the king and Six Ministries. There were six royal secretaries, one for each ministry, of senior third rank. Their primary role was to pass down royal decree to the ministries and submit petitions to the king, but they also advised the king and served in other key positions close to the king.\n*Capital Bureau (Hanseungbu, \ud55c\uc131\ubd80, \u6f22\u57ce\u5e9c) - It was in charge of running the capital, ''Hanyang'' or present-day Seoul. It was composed of nine officials, led by ''Paanyoon''(\ud310\uc724), of senior second rank and equivalent to today's mayor of Seoul.\n*Royal Investigation Bureau (Uigeumbu, \uc758\uae08\ubd80, \u7fa9\u7981\u5e9c) - It was an investigative and enforcement office under direct control of the king. It chiefly dealt with treason and other serious cases that concerned the king and served to arrest, investigate, imprison, and carry out sentences against the suspected offenders, who were often government officials.\n*Office of Records (Chunchugwan, \ucd98\ucd94\uad00, \u6625\u79cb\u9928) - Its officials wrote, compiled, and maintained the government and historical records.\n*[[Seonggyungwan]] or Royal Academy (\uc131\uade0\uad00, \u6210\u5747\u9928) - Royal university served to prepare the future government officials. Those who passed first two stages of [[gwageo]] examinations were admitted to Seonggyungwan. The class size was usually 200 students, who lived in the residential hall and followed strict routine and school rules. It also served as the state shrine for Chinese and Korean Confucian scholars.  The official in charge was Daesaseong (\ub300\uc0ac\uc131, \u5927\u53f8\u6210), of senior third rank, and 36 other officials including those from other offices were involved in running the academy.\n\n== Local government ==\nThe ranked officials were sent from the central government. Sometimes a [[secret royal inspector]] (Amhaeng-eosa, \uc554\ud589\uc5b4\uc0ac) was sent to travel incognito and monitor the provincial officials.  Secret inspectors were generally young officials of lower rank but invested with royal authority to dismiss corrupt officials.\n\n*Provinces: (Do, \ub3c4) \u2013 There were eight provinces, each of them governed by a Governor (Gwanchalsa, \uad00\ucc30\uc0ac), a position of junior second rank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://100.daum.net/encyclopedia/view.do?docid=b02g1186a|script-title=ko:\uad00\ucc30\uc0ac|publisher=Britannica Korea|accessdate=2014-03-16|language=Korean}}</ref> \n* Special cities: Bu (\ubd80) \u2013 administrative offices in charge of five major cities in provinces.

The yangban of each county (''gun'') composed a Local Office. This interacted with local officials, typically of a lower class, who were known as ''[[hyangni]]''. The ''hyangni'' typically served for life in hereditary posts. The ''hyangni'' of each county had an ambassador in the capital who was charged with communicating among them and the central government .\n\n==Factions==\n{{main article|Political factions in Joseon Dynasty}}\nThroughout the dynasty, various regional and ideological factions struggled for dominance in the political system. In the earliest years of Joseon, tension between the capital faction and the [[Yeongnam]]-based [[Sarim]] faction dominated national politics. The different [[Seowon]] across the country, which combined the functions of Confucian shrines with educational institutions, often reflected the factional alignment of the local elite. In the 16th century, a nationwide split occurred between the [[Easterners]] (''Dongin'') and [[Westerners]] (''Seoin''), and within decades the Easterners eventually split into the [[Northerners (Korean political faction)|Northerners]] (''Bukin'') and the more moderate [[Southerners (Korean political faction)|Southerners]] (''Namin'')<ref>{{cite book| last  = \uc774\uc131\ubb34| date   = November 12, 2007| title     = \uc870\uc120\ub2f9\uc7c1\uc0ac 1 \uc0ac\ub9bc\uc815\uce58\uc640 \ub2f9\uc7c1: \uc120\uc870\ubd80\uc870 ~ \ud604\uc885\uc870 | publisher = \uc544\ub984\ub2e4\uc6b4\ub0a0 | isbn = 9788989354826}}</ref> In the seventeenth century, the Westerners too divided into the [[Patriarchs (Joseon faction)|Patriarchs]] (''Noron'') and the [[Disciples (Joseon faction)|Disciples]] (''Soron'').<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ebrey |first1=Patricia |last2=Walthall |first2=Ann |date= 2013 |title= East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History, Volume II: From 1600 |url=  https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=5pLGIcp4PMgC&pg=PA255&lpg=PA255&dq=patriarchs+joseon+faction&source=bl&ots=oiKV4Z7zc4&sig=3ufC6aCxfnucZGcucr48ScNFy8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBGoVChMI_oiRpp3cxgIVAzimCh2y3AgO#v=onepage&q=patriarchs%20joseon%20faction&f=false |publisher= Cengage Learning|page= 255 |isbn= |access-date= July 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nUnder the reigns of [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]] and [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]] in the 18th century, the kings generally pursued the *tangpyeongchaek*, a policy of balance favoring no faction over another.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 223.</ref> In Jeongjo's reign, strife emerged between the [[Intransigents]] (''Byeokpa'') and the [[Expedients]] (''Shipa''), two groups which cut across the earlier factions and differed in their attitudes concerning certain royal policies; the Intransigents were more opposed to the king and largely composed of Patriarchs.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title= \ubcbd\ud30c |encyclopedia= \ud55c\uad6d\ubbfc\uc871\ubb38\ud654\ub300\ubc31\uacfc}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last  = \uc774\uc131\ubb34| date   = November 12, 2007| title     = \uc870\uc120\ub2f9\uc7c1\uc0ac 2 \ud0d5\ud3c9\uacfc \uc138\ub3c4\uc815\uce58: \uc219\uc885\uc870~\uace0\uc885\uc870| publisher = \uc544\ub984\ub2e4\uc6b4\ub0a0 | isbn = 9788989354833}}</ref> In the 19th century, Joseon politics shifted as in-law families (called ''cheokga'') rather than scholarly factions came to dominate the throne. For most of the 19th century, the Jangdong branch of the Andong [[Kim (Korean name)|Kim]] clan was in control of the government; however, there was a brief interlude in which control shifted to the Pungyang [[Cho (Korean name)|Cho]] clan.\n\nDuring the reign of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Gojong]], real power initially belonged to his father the [[Heungseon Daewongun]], who on one hand sought to reform corrupt state institutions but on the other hand pursued a policy of isolationism, opposing the opening of the country to Western and Japanese influences. From the 1870s onwards, [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]] (known posthumously as Empress Myeongseong) became more dominant and pursued a policy of cautious modernisation and opening up. Her dominance was opposed by reactionaries and progressives alike. The [[Enlightenment Party]] (also known as Progressives) sought to modernise the country along Western and Japanese lines. Even amongst the modernisers factions emerged, with one faction favouring the [[Russian Empire]] and a second favouring the [[Japanese Empire]], initially the influence of the Russians was strongest but waned with their defeat to Japan in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. These factional struggles led to the [[Imo Incident]] and [[Gapsin Coup]], as well as increased foreign interference in Korean affairs.\n\n===Purges===\n[[Korean Literati Purges|Purges in Joseon Dynasty]] were often violent, leading to the execution and [[Exile|internal exile]] of many members of the losing side. In some cases, even the graves of their ancestors were desecrated.  Purges were especially widespread during [[Sukjong of Joseon|Sukjong]]'s reign, when there was change of faction in power four times, each time accompanied by cycle of revenge for earlier wrongdoings.\n\n==Rebellions==\nThe most famous rebellions took place in the 19th century, as the social system of Joseon was beginning to collapse: the rebellion of [[Hong Gyeong-nae]] in the northern provinces in 1811, the [[Imo Incident]] of 1882, and the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution|Donghak uprising]] of 1894\u20131895.\n\nOccasional rebellions also took place among the country's small ethnic minorities. The Tungusic tribes of the northeast rose in 1583 under [[Nitanggae]] and seized a number of towns; they were put down by the general [[Shin Rip]].  Thereafter markets were established in the region to help supply the tribesmen with needed goods.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 193.</ref> In 1510, Japanese merchants and settlers had risen in rebellion against a local commander; this was followed by the expulsion of all Japanese and the closure of the ports for two years. After the Seven Year War, Japanese access to the country was sharply constrained, and such incidents ceased to occur.\n\n==Diplomacy==\nJoseon's international relations implemented Korean Neo-Confucian ideal of \"serving the great\" (''sadae'') to Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] and later Manchu [[Qing dynasty]].\n\nOn a lower level, the country maintained ties with various neighboring nations, including the Jurchen tribes of the north and the Japanese and [[Ry\u016bky\u016b]] states across the sea. To this end, interpreting schools were set up in the capital and in border towns such as [[Jeju City|Jeju]] and Busan.\n\nThe Joseon Dynasty endured two major invasions prior its progressive loss of sovereignty in the late 19th century. These were the [[Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea|Seven Year War]], a two-stage Japanese invasion led by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] in the 1590s, and the [[First Manchu expedition to Korea|First]] and [[Second Manchu expedition to Korea|Second]] Manchu invasions in the early 17th century. Although the Japanese were ultimately repelled, Joseon was compelled to surrender to the Manchus, who later became the [[Qing Dynasty]].\n\nAfter the [[Treaty of Ganghwa]] and the opening of the ports in 1876, the diplomatic approach changed, and the government of Joseon began to enter into diplomatic relations with both neighboring and European countries.\n\n===Treaties of Joseon Dynasty===\n\n====Before 1875====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|Treaty\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Signatory country\n|-\n!

Political struggles were common between different factions of the scholar-officials. [[Korean Literati Purges|Purges]] frequently resulted in leading political figures being sent into exile or condemned to death.\n\nThe political system of this period was dominated by a Confucianist bureaucracy. The government officials were ranked in 18 levels, ranging from senior first rank (jeong-il-pum, [[Hangul]]: \uc8151\ud488, [[Hanja]]: \u6b63\u4e00\u54c1) down to junior ninth rank (jong-gu-pum, [[Hangul|\uc8859\ud488]], [[Hanja|\u5f9e\u4e5d\u54c1]]) based on seniority and promotion, which was achieved through the royal decree based on examinations and recommendations.\n\nThe power of the bureaucrats often eclipsed that of the central authorities, including the monarch. For much of the dynasty, a complex system of checks and balances prevented any one section of the government from gaining overwhelming power until the 19th century when political power became concentrated in a certain family or individual.\n\n==Government==\n\n===The king===\nThe king ruled for life, unlike any of his appointees. The kings of Joseon were all of the [[Jeonju Yi clan]] and notionally descended from [[Taejo of Joseon|Taejo]], although some were adopted. For a list of Joseon kings, see [[List of Korean monarchs]]. Under Confucian philosophy, the king commanded absolute loyalty from his officials and subjects, but the officials were also expected to try to guide the king to the right path if the latter was mistaken. Natural disasters were thought to be due to the king's failings, and therefore, Joseon kings were very sensitive to their occurrences.\n\n===Civil service===\nIn order to serve in the positions of responsibility outside the military in [[Joseon Dynasty]], one had to take a series of  [[gwageo]] literary examinations and pass each of them (usually four to five times). Theoretically, any male other than [[cheonmin]] (lowest class) and children of concubines could take [[gwageo]] examinations to enter a civil service and thus become [[yangban]] (nobility class).  In actuality, only the [[yangban]] class had the luxury of time and money as well as the necessary connections to pass [[gwageo]] exams. In addition, people from the troublesome northern provinces of [[Hamgyeong]] and [[Pyeongan]] were barred from office for much of the dynasty.\n\nOfficials served in positions for fixed terms, varying from one year to five years. A successful official might serve in tens of positions in the course of a career.\n\n===State council===\n{{main article|State Council of Joseon}}\n\n[[State Council of Joseon|State Council]] (Uijeongbu, [[Hangul]]: \uc758\uc815\ubd80, [[Hanja]]: \u8b70\u653f\u5e9c) was the highest deliberative body of the Joseon Dynasty although it faded in importance after first centuries of rule. It was composed of twelve officials. The Chief State Councillor ([[Yeonguijeong]], \uc601\uc758\uc815, \u9818\u8b70\u653f), Left State Councillor ([[Jwauijeong]], \uc88c\uc758\uc815), and Right State Councillor (Uuijeong, \uc6b0\uc758\uc815) were the highest-ranking officials in the government (senior first rank). They were assisted by Left Minister (Jwachanseong, \uc88c\ucc2c\uc131) and Right Minister (Uichangseong, \uc6b0\ucc2c\uc131), both of junior first rank, and seven lower ranking officials. The power of State Council was inversely proportional to the king's power. Sometimes it directly controlled [[Six Ministries of Joseon|Six Ministries]], the chief executive body of Joseon government, but primarily served in advisory role under stronger kings. State councillors served in several other positions including a tutor to the crown prince.\n\n===Six Ministries===\n{{main article|Six Ministries of Joseon}}\n\nThe [[Six Ministries of Joseon|Six Ministries]] (Yukjo, [[Hangul]]: \uc721\uc870, [[Hanja]]: \u516d\u66f9) were the chief executive body of [[Joseon]]. Each Minister (Panseo, \ud310\uc11c) was of senior second rank (2a, third highest rank) and was assisted by a Deputy-Minister (Champan, \ucc38\ud310) of junior second rank (2b, fourth highest rank) and a Secretary (Chamui, \ucc38\uc758) of rank 3a. Apart from these three Dangsanggwan (\ub2f9\uc0c1\uad00, \u5802\u4e0a\u5b98) officials, each Ministry was headed by three Jeongrang (\uc815\ub791, rank 5a) and three Jwarang (\uc88c\ub791, rank 6a), adding to nine officials ranked 6a or above.\n\n*Ministry of Personnel (Ijo, \uc774\uc870, \u540f\u66f9) \u2013 was primarily concerned with appointment of officials\n*Ministry of Taxation (Hojo, \ud638\uc870, \u6236\u66f9) \u2013 taxation, finances, census, agriculture, and land policies\n*Ministry of Rites (Yejo, \uc608\uc870, \u79ae\u66f9) \u2013 rituals, culture, diplomacy, gwageo\n*[[Ministry of Defence|Ministry of National Defense (South Korea)]] (Byeongjo, \ubcd1\uc870, \u5175\u66f9) \u2013 military affairs\n*Ministry of Justice (Hyeongjo, \ud615\uc870, \u5211\u66f9) \u2013 administration of law, slavery, punishments\n*Ministry of Works (Gongjo, \uacf5\uc870, \u5de5\u66f9) \u2013 industry, public works, manufacturing, mining\n\n===Three Offices===\n{{main article|Three offices of Joseon}}\n\n[[Three Offices]] (Samsa, [[Hangul]]: \uc0bc\uc0ac, [[Hanja]]: \u4e09\u53f8) is a collective name for three offices that provided checks and balance on the king and the officials. The officials who served in these offices tended to be younger and of lower rank compared to other offices but enjoyed special privileges and prestige. They went through more thorough review of moral character and family background.   \n*Office of Inspector General (Saheonbu, \uc0ac\ud5cc\ubd80, \u53f8\u61b2\u5e9c) - It monitored government administration and officials in both central and local governments for corruption or incompetence. It was run by 30 officials including Inspector General (Daesaheon, \ub300\uc0ac\ud5cc), a position of junior second rank.\n*Office of Censors (Saganwon, \uc0ac\uac04\uc6d0, \u53f8\u8aeb\u9662) - Its chief function was to remonstrate with the king if there was wrong or improper action or policy.  It also impeached corrupt officials and spoke opinions about the general state of affairs.  It was composed of five officials, led by Chief Censor (Daesagan, \ub300\uc0ac\uac04), of senior third rank.  Its function as organ of speech often overlapped with Office of Inspector General, and they sometimes submitted joint petition to the king.\n*Office of Special Advisors (Hongmoongwan, \ud64d\ubb38\uad00, \u5f18\u6587\u9928) - It oversaw the royal library and served as research institute to study Confucian philosophy and answer the king's questions. It was composed of 21 officials, but its three highest officials were ministers serving in State Council and the actual head of the office was Deputy Chief Scholar (Bujehak, \ubd80\uc81c\ud559), a position of senior third rank.  Its officials took part in the daily lessons called ''kyeongyeon''(\uacbd\uc5f0), in which they discussed Confucian philosophy with the king.  These discussions often led to comments on current political issues, and these officials had significant influence as advisors. (It was established to replace [[Hall of Worthies]] (Jiphyeonjeon, \uc9d1\ud604\uc804, \u96c6\u8ce2\u6bbf) after the latter was abolished by [[Sejo of Joseon|King Sejo]] in the aftermath of [[Six martyred ministers]].)\n\nThe Samsa provided a key check on the powers of the other branches of government. The Inspector-General and Censor-General had the unique power to vet potential appointees for all positions, and examine their family backgrounds.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 176.</ref> They thus played a role in maintaining the integrity of the yangban aristocracy.\n\n===Other Offices===\n*Royal Secretariat (Seungjeongwon, \uc2b9\uc815\uc6d0, \u627f\u653f\u9662) - It served as a liaison between the king and Six Ministries. There were six royal secretaries, one for each ministry, of senior third rank. Their primary role was to pass down royal decree to the ministries and submit petitions to the king, but they also advised the king and served in other key positions close to the king.\n*Capital Bureau (Hanseungbu, \ud55c\uc131\ubd80, \u6f22\u57ce\u5e9c) - It was in charge of running the capital, ''Hanyang'' or present-day Seoul. It was composed of nine officials, led by ''Paanyoon''(\ud310\uc724), of senior second rank and equivalent to today's mayor of Seoul.\n*Royal Investigation Bureau (Uigeumbu, \uc758\uae08\ubd80, \u7fa9\u7981\u5e9c) - It was an investigative and enforcement office under direct control of the king. It chiefly dealt with treason and other serious cases that concerned the king and served to arrest, investigate, imprison, and carry out sentences against the suspected offenders, who were often government officials.\n*Office of Records (Chunchugwan, \ucd98\ucd94\uad00, \u6625\u79cb\u9928) - Its officials wrote, compiled, and maintained the government and historical records.\n*[[Seonggyungwan]] or Royal Academy (\uc131\uade0\uad00, \u6210\u5747\u9928) - Royal university served to prepare the future government officials. Those who passed first two stages of [[gwageo]] examinations were admitted to Seonggyungwan. The class size was usually 200 students, who lived in the residential hall and followed strict routine and school rules. It also served as the state shrine for Chinese and Korean Confucian scholars.  The official in charge was Daesaseong (\ub300\uc0ac\uc131, \u5927\u53f8\u6210), of senior third rank, and 36 other officials including those from other offices were involved in running the academy.\n\n== Local government ==\nThe ranked officials were sent from the central government. Sometimes a [[secret royal inspector]] (Amhaeng-eosa, \uc554\ud589\uc5b4\uc0ac) was sent to travel incognito and monitor the provincial officials.  Secret inspectors were generally young officials of lower rank but invested with royal authority to dismiss corrupt officials.\n\n*Provinces: (Do, \ub3c4) \u2013 There were eight provinces, each of them governed by a Governor (Gwanchalsa, \uad00\ucc30\uc0ac), a position of junior second rank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://100.daum.net/encyclopedia/view.do?docid=b02g1186a|script-title=ko:\uad00\ucc30\uc0ac|publisher=Britannica Korea|accessdate=2014-03-16|language=Korean}}</ref> \n* Special cities: Bu (\ubd80) \u2013 administrative offices in charge of five major cities in provinces.

The yangban of each county (''gun'') composed a Local Office. This interacted with local officials, typically of a lower class, who were known as ''[[hyangni]]''. The ''hyangni'' typically served for life in hereditary posts. The ''hyangni'' of each county had an ambassador in the capital who was charged with communicating among them and the central government .\n\n==Factions==\n{{main article|Political factions in Joseon Dynasty}}\nThroughout the dynasty, various regional and ideological factions struggled for dominance in the political system. In the earliest years of Joseon, tension between the capital faction and the [[Yeongnam]]-based [[Sarim]] faction dominated national politics. The different [[Seowon]] across the country, which combined the functions of Confucian shrines with educational institutions, often reflected the factional alignment of the local elite. In the 16th century, a nationwide split occurred between the [[Easterners]] (''Dongin'') and [[Westerners]] (''Seoin''), and within decades the Easterners eventually split into the [[Northerners (Korean political faction)|Northerners]] (''Bukin'') and the more moderate [[Southerners (Korean political faction)|Southerners]] (''Namin'')<ref>{{cite book| last  = \uc774\uc131\ubb34| date   = November 12, 2007| title     = \uc870\uc120\ub2f9\uc7c1\uc0ac 1 \uc0ac\ub9bc\uc815\uce58\uc640 \ub2f9\uc7c1: \uc120\uc870\ubd80\uc870 ~ \ud604\uc885\uc870 | publisher = \uc544\ub984\ub2e4\uc6b4\ub0a0 | isbn = 9788989354826}}</ref> In the seventeenth century, the Westerners too divided into the [[Patriarchs (Joseon faction)|Patriarchs]] (''Noron'') and the [[Disciples (Joseon faction)|Disciples]] (''Soron'').<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ebrey |first1=Patricia |last2=Walthall |first2=Ann |date= 2013 |title= East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History, Volume II: From 1600 |url=  https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=5pLGIcp4PMgC&pg=PA255&lpg=PA255&dq=patriarchs+joseon+faction&source=bl&ots=oiKV4Z7zc4&sig=3ufC6aCxfnucZGcucr48ScNFy8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBGoVChMI_oiRpp3cxgIVAzimCh2y3AgO#v=onepage&q=patriarchs%20joseon%20faction&f=false |publisher= Cengage Learning|page= 255 |isbn= |access-date= July 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nUnder the reigns of [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]] and [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]] in the 18th century, the kings generally pursued the *tangpyeongchaek*, a policy of balance favoring no faction over another.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 223.</ref> In Jeongjo's reign, strife emerged between the [[Intransigents]] (''Byeokpa'') and the [[Expedients]] (''Shipa''), two groups which cut across the earlier factions and differed in their attitudes concerning certain royal policies; the Intransigents were more opposed to the king and largely composed of Patriarchs.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title= \ubcbd\ud30c |encyclopedia= \ud55c\uad6d\ubbfc\uc871\ubb38\ud654\ub300\ubc31\uacfc}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last  = \uc774\uc131\ubb34| date   = November 12, 2007| title     = \uc870\uc120\ub2f9\uc7c1\uc0ac 2 \ud0d5\ud3c9\uacfc \uc138\ub3c4\uc815\uce58: \uc219\uc885\uc870~\uace0\uc885\uc870| publisher = \uc544\ub984\ub2e4\uc6b4\ub0a0 | isbn = 9788989354833}}</ref> In the 19th century, Joseon politics shifted as in-law families (called ''cheokga'') rather than scholarly factions came to dominate the throne. For most of the 19th century, the Jangdong branch of the Andong [[Kim (Korean name)|Kim]] clan was in control of the government; however, there was a brief interlude in which control shifted to the Pungyang [[Cho (Korean name)|Cho]] clan.\n\nDuring the reign of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Gojong]], real power initially belonged to his father the [[Heungseon Daewongun]], who on one hand sought to reform corrupt state institutions but on the other hand pursued a policy of isolationism, opposing the opening of the country to Western and Japanese influences. From the 1870s onwards, [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]] (known posthumously as Empress Myeongseong) became more dominant and pursued a policy of cautious modernisation and opening up. Her dominance was opposed by reactionaries and progressives alike. The [[Enlightenment Party]] (also known as Progressives) sought to modernise the country along Western and Japanese lines. Even amongst the modernisers factions emerged, with one faction favouring the [[Russian Empire]] and a second favouring the [[Japanese Empire]], initially the influence of the Russians was strongest but waned with their defeat to Japan in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. These factional struggles led to the [[Imo Incident]] and [[Gapsin Coup]], as well as increased foreign interference in Korean affairs.\n\n===Purges===\n[[Korean Literati Purges|Purges in Joseon Dynasty]] were often violent, leading to the execution and [[Exile|internal exile]] of many members of the losing side. In some cases, even the graves of their ancestors were desecrated.  Purges were especially widespread during [[Sukjong of Joseon|Sukjong]]'s reign, when there was change of faction in power four times, each time accompanied by cycle of revenge for earlier wrongdoings.\n\n==Rebellions==\nThe most famous rebellions took place in the 19th century, as the social system of Joseon was beginning to collapse: the rebellion of [[Hong Gyeong-nae]] in the northern provinces in 1811, the [[Imo Incident]] of 1882, and the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution|Donghak uprising]] of 1894\u20131895.\n\nOccasional rebellions also took place among the country's small ethnic minorities. The Tungusic tribes of the northeast rose in 1583 under [[Nitanggae]] and seized a number of towns; they were put down by the general [[Shin Rip]].  Thereafter markets were established in the region to help supply the tribesmen with needed goods.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 193.</ref> In 1510, Japanese merchants and settlers had risen in rebellion against a local commander; this was followed by the expulsion of all Japanese and the closure of the ports for two years. After the Seven Year War, Japanese access to the country was sharply constrained, and such incidents ceased to occur.\n\n==Diplomacy==\nJoseon's international relations implemented Korean Neo-Confucian ideal of \"serving the great\" (''sadae'') to Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] and later Manchu [[Qing dynasty]].\n\nOn a lower level, the country maintained ties with various neighboring nations, including the Jurchen tribes of the north and the Japanese and [[Ry\u016bky\u016b]] states across the sea. To this end, interpreting schools were set up in the capital and in border towns such as [[Jeju City|Jeju]] and Busan.\n\nThe Joseon Dynasty endured two major invasions prior its progressive loss of sovereignty in the late 19th century. These were the [[Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea|Seven Year War]], a two-stage Japanese invasion led by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] in the 1590s, and the [[First Manchu expedition to Korea|First]] and [[Second Manchu expedition to Korea|Second]] Manchu invasions in the early 17th century. Although the Japanese were ultimately repelled, Joseon was compelled to surrender to the Manchus, who later became the [[Qing Dynasty]].\n\nAfter the [[Treaty of Ganghwa]] and the opening of the ports in 1876, the diplomatic approach changed, and the government of Joseon began to enter into diplomatic relations with both neighboring and European countries.\n\n===Treaties of Joseon Dynasty===\n\n====Before 1875====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|Treaty\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Signatory country\n|-\n!

The first three seasons and the first half of season four focuses on both the patrol and Intelligence officers, and shifts to focus on the Intelligence Unit from the second half of season four on.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Chicago P.D. characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Jason Beghe]] as [[Hank Voight|Detective Sergeant Henry \"Hank\" Voight]], the enigmatic and often mercurial chief of the Chicago P.D.'s Intelligence Unit. Despite his brusque, tough exterior and take-no-prisoners approach to police work, he is loyal to the cops and detectives serving under him and highly dedicated to the victims of the crimes his unit investigates. He is first introduced in ''[[Chicago Fire (season 1)|Chicago Fire]]'' as a dirty cop who clashes with [[Chicago Fire Department|CFD]] [[Matthew Casey|Lieutenant Matthew Casey]] after Voight's son Justin causes an accident in which a teenager is paralyzed, and Casey, who was first on scene, had intended to testify that Justin was [[Driving under the influence|DUI]]. He was arrested by Det. Antonio Dawson for trying to have Casey silenced by force, but was later released from prison and reinstated to the police force by Internal Affairs. As a result, many of Casey's colleagues disliked him and Casey's superior Chief Boden has a love-hate working relationship with him. It is eventually revealed in the ''Chicago Fire'' episode \"[[Chicago Fire (season 1)#ep23|Let Her Go]]\" that his dirty cop alter ego was part of an undercover operation to catch criminals and other dirty cops. Prior to taking command of Intelligence, Voight worked in the Gang Unit. His father Richard was a former CPD officer who was killed in the line of duty. Voight is a widower; his wife, Camille, died of cancer some years prior. His son, Justin, served in the [[United States Army|Army]] and was killed in the last episode of season 3 while trying to help a friend. Hank took an interest in Erin Lindsay at 15 and raised her as his daughter.\n* [[Jon Seda]] as [[Antonio Dawson|Senior Detective Antonio Dawson]] (seasons 1\u20136), an Intelligence Unit detective who previously arrested Voight for harassment and has since worked alongside him. Unlike Voight, he has limits on how far he will go to get criminals off the streets, as shown by the fact that he asked Halstead to stop Voight from killing anyone while on the hunt for Pulpo, as he did not want it on his conscience. He and his ex-wife Laura have two children: Diego and Eva. He is the older brother of  ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' character [[Gabriela Dawson|Gabriela \"Gabby\" Dawson]].  In season 4, he is offered a job at the State's Attorney's Office as Lead Investigator, which he accepts. After becoming disillusioned with the job, he returns to the unit in the first episode of season 5. In season 6, Antonio struggles with recovering from a shoulder injury and dependency on the oxycodone he is taking for the pain. After a dealer he owes kidnaps, beats, and rapes his daughter, Antonio, high on oxy, kills him in revenge. Though Voight and Ruzek manage to cover up the incident as self-defense, and Antonio successfully recovers in rehab, mayor-hopeful Superintendent Brian Kelton later gets the case re-opened in order to take down the Intelligence Unit, and in the season finale, Antonio relapses after Ruzek is arrested after taking the blame for everything to protect him. In the season 7 premiere, it's revealed that Voight found Antonio and checked him into an off-the-books rehab clinic to get him clean again while also protecting his career. It was revealed several episodes later that Antonio resigned and moved to Puerto Rico to spend more time with his family.\n* [[Sophia Bush]] as [[Erin Lindsay|Detective Erin Lindsay]] (seasons 1\u20134),<ref>{{cite web|title=Sophia Bush Leaving Chicago PD After 4 Seasons|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/857200/sophia-bush-leaving-chicago-pd-after-4-seasons|accessdate=May 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526115316/http://www.eonline.com/news/857200/sophia-bush-leaving-chicago-pd-after-4-seasons|archive-date=May 26, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> a tough Intelligence Unit detective and former [[confidential informant|CI]] whom Voight took under his wing when she was a juvenile delinquent.

The first three seasons and the first half of season four focuses on both the patrol and Intelligence officers, and shifts to focus on the Intelligence Unit from the second half of season four on.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Chicago P.D. characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Jason Beghe]] as [[Hank Voight|Detective Sergeant Henry \"Hank\" Voight]], the enigmatic and often mercurial chief of the Chicago P.D.'s Intelligence Unit. Despite his brusque, tough exterior and take-no-prisoners approach to police work, he is loyal to the cops and detectives serving under him and highly dedicated to the victims of the crimes his unit investigates. He is first introduced in ''[[Chicago Fire (season 1)|Chicago Fire]]'' as a dirty cop who clashes with [[Chicago Fire Department|CFD]] [[Matthew Casey|Lieutenant Matthew Casey]] after Voight's son Justin causes an accident in which a teenager is paralyzed, and Casey, who was first on scene, had intended to testify that Justin was [[Driving under the influence|DUI]]. He was arrested by Det. Antonio Dawson for trying to have Casey silenced by force, but was later released from prison and reinstated to the police force by Internal Affairs. As a result, many of Casey's colleagues disliked him and Casey's superior Chief Boden has a love-hate working relationship with him. It is eventually revealed in the ''Chicago Fire'' episode \"[[Chicago Fire (season 1)#ep23|Let Her Go]]\" that his dirty cop alter ego was part of an undercover operation to catch criminals and other dirty cops. Prior to taking command of Intelligence, Voight worked in the Gang Unit. His father Richard was a former CPD officer who was killed in the line of duty. Voight is a widower; his wife, Camille, died of cancer some years prior. His son, Justin, served in the [[United States Army|Army]] and was killed in the last episode of season 3 while trying to help a friend. Hank took an interest in Erin Lindsay at 15 and raised her as his daughter.\n* [[Jon Seda]] as [[Antonio Dawson|Senior Detective Antonio Dawson]] (seasons 1\u20136), an Intelligence Unit detective who previously arrested Voight for harassment and has since worked alongside him. Unlike Voight, he has limits on how far he will go to get criminals off the streets, as shown by the fact that he asked Halstead to stop Voight from killing anyone while on the hunt for Pulpo, as he did not want it on his conscience. He and his ex-wife Laura have two children: Diego and Eva. He is the older brother of  ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' character [[Gabriela Dawson|Gabriela \"Gabby\" Dawson]].  In season 4, he is offered a job at the State's Attorney's Office as Lead Investigator, which he accepts. After becoming disillusioned with the job, he returns to the unit in the first episode of season 5. In season 6, Antonio struggles with recovering from a shoulder injury and dependency on the oxycodone he is taking for the pain. After a dealer he owes kidnaps, beats, and rapes his daughter, Antonio, high on oxy, kills him in revenge. Though Voight and Ruzek manage to cover up the incident as self-defense, and Antonio successfully recovers in rehab, mayor-hopeful Superintendent Brian Kelton later gets the case re-opened in order to take down the Intelligence Unit, and in the season finale, Antonio relapses after Ruzek is arrested after taking the blame for everything to protect him. In the season 7 premiere, it's revealed that Voight found Antonio and checked him into an off-the-books rehab clinic to get him clean again while also protecting his career. It was revealed several episodes later that Antonio resigned and moved to Puerto Rico to spend more time with his family.\n* [[Sophia Bush]] as [[Erin Lindsay|Detective Erin Lindsay]] (seasons 1\u20134),<ref>{{cite web|title=Sophia Bush Leaving Chicago PD After 4 Seasons|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/857200/sophia-bush-leaving-chicago-pd-after-4-seasons|accessdate=May 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526115316/http://www.eonline.com/news/857200/sophia-bush-leaving-chicago-pd-after-4-seasons|archive-date=May 26, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> a tough Intelligence Unit detective and former [[confidential informant|CI]] whom Voight took under his wing when she was a juvenile delinquent.

She went on to become a receptionist at [[Kiss 102]] in Manchester. In 1997, she became the presenter and producer of ''The Word'' radio programme as [[Kiss 105]] went on the air. She subsequently presented [[Capital Manchester|Galaxy 102]] FM's Morning Show, Network Chill Out Show and The [[Galaxy Radio|Galaxy]] Chart for [[Manchester]]. She left as anchor of the Morning Show for a job at BBC Radio 1.\n \nNemone joined [[BBC Radio 1]] in October 2000 initially hosting the Saturday breakfast show. She filled in for [[Jo Whiley]]'s weekday morning show in 2001 while Whiley was on maternity leave. She then took the weekend afternoon slot which she hosted from Autumn 2001 through to the end of 2003.\n\nAfter a revamp of the Radio 1 daytime schedule from early 2004, Nemone replaced [[Scott Mills]] on the overnight show (4{{nbsp}}am{{snd}}7{{nbsp}}am) broadcasting to audiences in excess of 3 million. She left Radio 1 in September 2005; [[JK and Joel]] (Monday-Thursday) and [[Fearne Cotton]] and [[Reggie Yates]] (Friday) took over her early morning slot.\n\nShe joined [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] on 3 October 2005, she began presenting the ''[[Dream Ticket]]'' show as well as filling in on 6 Music's drive time show when [[Steve Lamacq]] was away.\n\nNemone took over [[Vic McGlynn]]'s weekday lunchtime show, weekdays in the 3{{snd}}4{{nbsp}}pm slot on 4 September 2006.

After Matthews herself went on maternity leave on 24 November, the show was presented by either [[Chris Hawkins]] or [[Andrew Collins (broadcaster)|Andrew Collins]]. In July 2009, Nemone gave birth to a baby girl and returned to the station on 1 February 2010.\n\nWhen pregnant with her second child in 2011, she moved from weekdays taking over the weekend breakfast show.  After a short maternity leave she returned, steering it to record RAJAR figures.\n\nThe requirement to take the show to Media City in Salford meant Nemone passing on the opportunity of returning to Manchester; electing to stay in London where she had established her young family.\n\nIn April 2013 Nemone fulfilled a lifelong ambition to curate a specialist dance and electronic music show on BBC Radio 6 Music \u2013 ''Nemone's Electric Ladyland''. She runs a club night in West London.\n\nShe participated with her daughter in the Bumps & Babies Mile in [[Battersea Park]] for [[Sport Relief 2010]] along with [[Denise Van Outen]], [[Carly Cole]], [[Gail Emms]], [[Natasha Kaplinsky]] and [[Kim Medcalf]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sportrelief/news/180210_bumpsbabies.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Sport Relief \u2013 Bumps and Babies Mile|work=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2010/02/19/bump-in-the-white-115875-22053881/|title=Carly Zucker joins Denise Van Outen on Sports Relief Bumps and Babies Mile in London|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=19 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Television career==\nNemone co-hosted the [[BBC One]] television programme ''[[101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow]]'' alongside [[Steve Jones (Welsh presenter)|Steve Jones]].

Her specialist subject was the children's books of [[Roald Dahl]], and she came 2nd in the show.\n\n==Musical career==\nNemone is an accomplished musician. She was singer and saxophonist in a [[funk]] band \u2013 other members being Tom Findlay (who went on to form [[Groove Armada]]),<ref>stated by Nemone, herself, on-air, The Dream Ticket show, 19 January 2006.</ref> Andy Spence from NYPC, and Perrier Award-winning comedian [[Dan Antopolski]].\n\n==Athletic career==\nApart from radio and TV broadcasting, Nemone is also a keen athlete.
