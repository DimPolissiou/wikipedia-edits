He is currently a teacher at Northampton College. A politician of the left, Clarke was until  was until recently the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] National Spokesperson on International and Foreign Affairs; previously a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician, he was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Northampton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Northampton South]] from 1997\u20132005. Clarke was also a director of Northampton Town Football Club for 11 years 1999- 2010 and as General Manager at the club between 2005 and 2008. He served three terms (12 years) on Northampton Borough Council (2 Labour, 1 Independent) and one term (4 years) on Northamptonshire County Council (Independent) He also served as a Special Constable with Northamptonshire Police between 2003 and 2007.\n\nOn 11 March 2013, Clarke announced that he had joined the Green Party, and would campaign as an Independent Green and stand as a Green Party candidate in the [[2013 Northamptonshire County Council election|2013 local elections]]. He is quoted as saying: \"I left the Labour Party, and then discovered that really it had left me, I have battled on as an Independent to try to make a difference for local people and have had some successes, but now it is time to truly give the power back to the people. I have chosen to campaign and as an Independent Green and proudly display the Green Party Logo on the ballot paper\".<ref name = \"NC&E_14_03_2013\">[http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/local/ex-northampton-south-mp-tony-clarke-joins-the-green-party-1-4885070 ''Ex-Northampton South MP Tony Clarke joins the Green Party'' Northampton Chronicle & Echo 14 March 2013, accessed 14 March 2013\"]</ref>  Tony Clarke is still a local community activist in Northampton and is currently employed teaching public Services at Northampton College.\n\n==Labour Councillor and former MP==\nBefore becoming an MP, Clarke had previously been a Social Work lecturer and Labour Councillor on [[Northampton Borough Council]]. He won the parliamentary seat unexpectedly at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] with a majority of 744 <ref>{{cite web|title = General Election results|url = http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/constit/191.htm|accessdate = 2008-06-06}}</ref> over the sitting [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Michael Morris, Baron Naseby|Michael Morris]], with a campaign based on local representation. Morris, the [[Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons]], had a 14,000 vote majority at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 election]], and the seat was considered safe for the Conservatives.\n\nAt the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], Clarke held the seat with a majority of 885 votes over the Conservative candidate [[Shailesh Vara]]. However, Conservative [[Brian Binley]] took the seat with a majority of 4,419 at the May 2005 General Election.\n\nClarke was regarded as a rebel and an anti-war MP.  Despite his stance against the invasion of Iraq, on receiving a copy of a confidential memo between [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Tony Blair]], and [[US President]] [[George W. Bush]], he chose to report the leak to the police (to protect those in the theatre of war) rather than publicly expose what was said.<ref name=\"Pair are guilty of Bush memo leak\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/6637735.stm Pair are guilty of Bush memo leak]</ref><ref name= \"Pair are sentenced\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/6641983.stm Pair given custodial sentences]</ref> From 2003 to 2005 he chaired the Northern Ireland Select Committee (Delegated Affairs) during the suspension of the NI Assembly.\n\n==Labour expulsion and independent councillor==\nIn May 2007, he was chosen by Northampton Labour Party to stand in the safe Labour Castle ward for the 3 May local elections. The decision created a split between the local Labour Party and the Labour party nationally and regionally, and the reasons have never been clear. It is speculated that the regional and national party forced Clarke out and selected their own candidate Tess Scott on an all women short list against the local party's wishes and outside of the Labour Party rules. They then selected Clarke and had three candidates for a two-member ward before telling him he could not stand.  As a result, Clarke decided to stand as an Independent and fight against the official Labour Party candidate in Castle ward, a decision which resulted in his expulsion from the Labour Party. Castle was a two-member ward but unusually Labour could only field one candidate.\n\nEight other local Labour members were also expelled; including Clarke's running mate in the election, Peter Evans, also a previous Borough Councillor; John Dickie, a former Labour leader of the Borough Council; and a second former Labour leader of the Borough Council, Geoff Howes. Howes had also been a Mayor of the town who, not long before, had been elected by the then controlling Labour party as a [[Freedom of the City|Freeman of the Borough]]. Clarke said: \"...They [Labour] have shot themselves in the foot. This...was a contributing factor to their losses...[in the May 2007 borough elections]\".<ref name =\"NCE2007_05_08\">{{cite web|title = ''Northampton Chronicle & Echo'' Labour ousts the political heavyweights |url = http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news?articleid=2859745|accessdate = 28 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nClark won the Castle seat on [[Northampton Borough Council]].<ref>{{cite web|title = ''Northampton Chronicle & Echo'' Election Shock|url = http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/Election-shock.2227381.jp\n|accessdate = 2008-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Northampton Borough Council Election Results 2007|url = http://www.northampton.gov.uk/downloads/declaration_of_results.pdf|accessdate = 22 February 2008}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Out of 47 councillors on the borough council, Labour ended up with only 5 seats, the Conservatives 15, and Clarke as the sole independent.

Clarke lost his seat at the May 2011 election to Labour, though the Conservatives regained control of the council.\n\n==Re-instatement==\nIn December 2008, Howes expulsion was reversed and he was reinstated two days before his appeal was due to be heard by the Labour Party's [[National Executive Committee]] (NEC).

He is currently a teacher at Northampton College. A politician of the left, Clarke was until  was until recently the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] National Spokesperson on International and Foreign Affairs; previously a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician, he was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Northampton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Northampton South]] from 1997-2005. Clarke was also a director of Northampton Town Football Club for 11 years 1999- 2010 and as General Manager at the club between 2005 and 2008. He served three terms (12 years) on Northampton Borough Council (2 Labour, 1 Independent) and one term (4 years) on Northamptonshire County Council (Independent) He also served as a Special Constable with Northamptonshire Police between 2003 and 2007.\n\nOn 11 March 2013, Clarke announced that he had joined the Green Party, and would campaign as an Independent Green and stand as a Green Party candidate in the [[2013 Northamptonshire County Council election|2013 local elections]]. He is quoted as saying: \"I left the Labour Party, and then discovered that really it had left me, I have battled on as an Independent to try to make a difference for local people and have had some successes, but now it is time to truly give the power back to the people. I have chosen to campaign and as an Independent Green and proudly display the Green Party Logo on the ballot paper\".<ref name = \"NC&E_14_03_2013\">[http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/local/ex-northampton-south-mp-tony-clarke-joins-the-green-party-1-4885070 ''Ex-Northampton South MP Tony Clarke joins the Green Party'' Northampton Chronicle & Echo 14 March 2013, accessed 14 March 2013\"]</ref>  Tony Clarke is still a local community activist in Northampton and is currently employed teaching public Services at Northampton College.\n\n==Labour Councillor and former MP==\nBefore becoming an MP, Clarke had previously been a Social Work lecturer and Labour Councillor on [[Northampton Borough Council]]. He won the parliamentary seat unexpectedly at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] with a majority of 744 <ref>{{cite web|title = General Election results|url = http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/constit/191.htm|accessdate = 2008-06-06}}</ref> over the sitting [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Michael Morris, Baron Naseby|Michael Morris]], with a campaign based on local representation. Morris, the [[Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons]], had a 14,000 vote majority at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 election]], and the seat was considered safe for the Conservatives.\n\nAt the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], Clarke held the seat with a majority of 885 votes over the Conservative candidate [[Shailesh Vara]]. However, Conservative [[Brian Binley]] took the seat with a majority of 4,419 at the May 2005 General Election.\n\nClarke was regarded as a rebel and an anti-war MP.  Despite his stance against the invasion of Iraq, on receiving a copy of a confidential memo between [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Tony Blair]], and [[US President]] [[George W. Bush]], he chose to report the leak to the police (to protect those in the theatre of war) rather than publicly expose what was said.<ref name=\"Pair are guilty of Bush memo leak\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/6637735.stm Pair are guilty of Bush memo leak]</ref><ref name= \"Pair are sentenced\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/6641983.stm Pair given custodial sentences]</ref> From 2003 to 2005 he chaired the Northern Ireland Select Committee (Delegated Affairs) during the suspension of the NI Assembly.\n\n==Labour expulsion and independent councillor==\nIn May 2007, he was chosen by Northampton Labour Party to stand in the safe Labour Castle ward for the 3 May local elections. The decision created a split between the local Labour Party and the Labour party nationally and regionally, and the reasons have never been clear. It is speculated that the regional and national party forced Clarke out and selected their own candidate Tess Scott on an all women short list against the local party's wishes and outside of the Labour Party rules. They then selected Clarke and had three candidates for a two member ward before telling him he could not stand.  As a result, Clarke decided to stand as an Independent and fight against the official Labour Party candidate in Castle ward, a decision which resulted in his expulsion from the Labour Party. Castle was a two-member ward but unusually Labour could only field one candidate.\n\nEight other local Labour members were also expelled; including Clarke's running mate in the election, Peter Evans, also a previous Borough Councillor; John Dickie, a former Labour leader of the Borough Council; and a second former Labour leader of the Borough Council, Geoff Howes. Howes had also been a Mayor of the town who, not long before, had been elected by the then controlling Labour party as a [[Freedom of the City|Freeman of the Borough]]. Clarke said: \"...They [Labour] have shot themselves in the foot. This...was a contributing factor to their losses...[in the May 2007 borough elections]\".<ref name =\"NCE2007_05_08\">{{cite web|title = ''Northampton Chronicle & Echo'' Labour ousts the political heavyweights |url = http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news?articleid=2859745|accessdate = 28 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nClark won the Castle seat on [[Northampton Borough Council]].<ref>{{cite web|title = ''Northampton Chronicle & Echo'' Election Shock|url = http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/Election-shock.2227381.jp\n|accessdate = 2008-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Northampton Borough Council Election Results 2007|url = http://www.northampton.gov.uk/downloads/declaration_of_results.pdf|accessdate = 22 February 2008}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Out of 47 councillors on the borough council, Labour ended up with only 5 seats, the Conservatives 15, and Clarke as the sole independent. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] took control with 26 seats, the first time for about 80 years since the Liberals were last in control. Clarke lost his seat at the May 2011 election to Labour, though the Conservatives regained control of the council.\n\n==Re-instatement==\nIn December 2008, Howes expulsion was reversed and he was reinstated two days before his appeal was due to be heard by the Labour Party's [[National Executive Committee]] (NEC). He was selected as the Labour candidate for a Northampton Borough Council by-election to be held 22 January 2009.<ref name=\"2009ByElection\">{{cite web|title=Northampton Borough Council'' - Statement of Persons Nominated |url=http://www.northampton.gov.uk/downloads/Persons_Nominated.doc |accessdate=31 December 2008 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}\n</ref> However, no official announcement was made by the local party on the status of Clarke or the other two candidates, Evans and Dickie, previously expelled.

The areas lost were generally be considered Conservative, thus increasing the possibility of Labour regaining the seat. However, it remained firmly Conservative with Clarke's intervention, having an effect on the Labour vote. Clarke had earlier said: ''\"...I think the only chance they [Labour] had of winning went out of the window when they declared internal war on half the membership [of the local Labour party] in 2005.

He was the victim of a [[kidnapping]] on September 28, 1953 that led to the largest [[ransom]] payment in American history (at the time).

He was 65 years old when Bobby was born in 1947, and the Greenleases doted upon him.\n\nBobby was said to be a trusting boy. According to author John Heidenry, whose book ''Zero at the Bone: The Playboy, the Prostitute, and the Murder of Bobby Greenlease'' is an account of the case, kidnapper Bonnie Heady said that from the moment she appeared at his school posing as his aunt to take him to his sick mother, Bobby just took her hand and did anything he was told to do.<ref name=\"DeadlyWomen\">As described in an episode of ''[[Deadly Women]]'' entitled \"Under His Control\", originally aired in the United States on 2010-10-21 on Investigation Discovery cable channel.</ref>\n\n==Abduction and murder==\n[[File:Photograph of Carl Austin Hall.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Carl Austin Hall]]\nIn September 1953, Carl Hall and Bonnie Heady [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] Bobby from [[Notre Dame de Sion School, Kansas City|Notre Dame de Sion]], a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] school located in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The kidnappers were drug-addicted [[alcoholism|alcoholics]] then living together in nearby [[St. Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph]]. In the early 1930s, Hall had attended [[Kemper Military School]] in [[Boonville, Missouri|Boonville]] with Paul Robert Greenlease, Bobby's adopted older brother. Hall had planned for years to victimize his former classmate's wealthy family.\n\nHeady went to Bobby's school, persuading a [[nun]] that she was his aunt, and told her that his mother had suffered a heart attack. She then took Bobby away and was gone by the time the Greenleases discovered the ruse. The couple then took Bobby across the state line to [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]], [[Kansas]], where Hall shot him dead with a [[revolver]]. They then took the child's body to St. Joseph and buried him in the backyard of Heady's house at 1201 South 38th Street.\n\nAfter the murder, Hall and Heady sent Bobby's father a message demanding a [[ransom]] of $600,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.6|1953|r=1|fmt=c}} million today). Greenlease, desperately trying to save his son, held off the police and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], paying the money. At that time it was the largest ransom ever paid in American history, and remained so until the 1972 kidnapping of [[Virginia Piper kidnapping|Virginia Piper]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-biggest-ransoms-ever-2012-9#|title=The 18 Largest Ransoms Ever Paid|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}</ref> Hall became convinced that police would trace them to St. Joseph, so he randomly decided to drive to [[St. Louis]]. The couple collected the ransom and fled.\n\n==Arrest==\nOnce in St. Louis, Hall left Heady in the middle of the night in a rented room. He contacted criminal associates to enlist their help in diverting police attention. One of the associates, a former [[prostitute]] named Sandra O'Day, was supposed to fly to [[Los Angeles]] and mail a letter Hall had written. It was thought that this would divert police attention from St. Louis. However, O'Day caught a glimpse of the ransom money.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite book |author=Heidenry, John |title=Zero at the Bone: The Playboy, the Prostitute, and the Murder of Bobby Greenlease |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |year=2009 |isbn=0-312-37679-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/zeroatboneplaybo00heid }}</ref> St. Louis police soon learned that Hall was flaunting a large sum of money, and they brought him in for questioning.\n\nHall eventually implicated Heady. The police found her at an apartment at 4504 Arsenal Street and discovered Bobby's body in a shallow grave in her backyard.<ref name=\"DeadlyWomen\"/> Bobby was later interred in a [[mausoleum]] at Forest Hill Cemetery in Kansas City.\n\n==Execution==\nBobby's kidnapping and murder scandalized the nation and soon led to federal [[indictment]]s for Hall and Heady. Both pleaded guilty to kidnapping and murder, and were [[execution|executed]] together in the Missouri [[gas chamber]] on December 18, 1953.\n\nHeady was one of only two women since 1865 to be executed by federal authorities. The other one was [[Ethel Greenglass Rosenberg]]. Since the federal government did not have any execution facilities, Missouri's state facilities were to carry out the executions.\n\nOnly $288,000 of the ransom money was recovered.

He was 65 years old when Bobby was born in 1947, and the Greenleases doted upon him.\n\nBobby was said to be a trusting boy. According to author John Heidenry, whose book ''Zero at the Bone: The Playboy, the Prostitute, and the Murder of Bobby Greenlease'' is an account of the case, kidnapper Bonnie Heady said that from the moment she appeared at his school posing as his aunt to take him to his sick mother, Bobby just took her hand and did anything he was told to do.<ref name=\"DeadlyWomen\">As described in an episode of ''[[Deadly Women]]'' entitled \"Under His Control\", originally aired in the United States on 2010-10-21 on Investigation Discovery cable channel.</ref>\n\n==Abduction and murder==\n[[File:Photograph of Carl Austin Hall.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Carl Austin Hall]]\nIn September 1953, Carl Hall and Bonnie Heady [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] Bobby from [[Notre Dame de Sion School, Kansas City|Notre Dame de Sion]], a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] school located in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The kidnappers were drug-addicted [[alcoholism|alcoholics]] then living together in nearby [[St. Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph]]. In the early 1930s, Hall had attended [[Kemper Military School]] in [[Boonville, Missouri|Boonville]] with Paul Robert Greenlease, Bobby's adopted older brother. Hall had planned for years to victimize his former classmate's wealthy family.\n\nHeady went to Bobby's school, persuading a [[nun]] that she was his aunt, and told her that his mother had suffered a heart attack. She then took Bobby away and was gone by the time the Greenleases discovered the ruse. The couple then took Bobby across the state line to [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]], [[Kansas]], where Hall shot him dead with a [[revolver]]. They then took the child's body to St. Joseph and buried him in the backyard of Heady's house at 1201 South 38th Street.\n\nAfter the murder, Hall and Heady sent Bobby's father a message demanding a [[ransom]] of $600,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.6|1953|r=1|fmt=c}} million today). Greenlease, desperately trying to save his son, held off the police and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], paying the money. At that time it was the largest ransom ever paid in American history, and remained so until the 1972 kidnapping of [[Virginia Piper kidnapping|Virginia Piper]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-biggest-ransoms-ever-2012-9#|title=The 18 Largest Ransoms Ever Paid|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}</ref> Hall became convinced that police would trace them to St. Joseph, so he randomly decided to drive to [[St. Louis]]. The couple collected the ransom and fled.\n\n==Arrest==\nOnce in St. Louis, Hall left Heady in the middle of the night in a rented room. He contacted criminal associates to enlist their help in diverting police attention. One of the associates, a former [[prostitute]] named Sandra O'Day, was supposed to fly to [[Los Angeles]] and mail a letter Hall had written. It was thought that this would divert police attention from St. Louis. However, O'Day caught a glimpse of the ransom money.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite book |author=Heidenry, John |title=Zero at the Bone: The Playboy, the Prostitute, and the Murder of Bobby Greenlease |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |year=2009 |isbn=0-312-37679-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/zeroatboneplaybo00heid }}</ref> St. Louis police soon learned that Hall was flaunting a large sum of money, and they brought him in for questioning.\n\nHall eventually implicated Heady. The police found her at an apartment at 4504 Arsenal Street and discovered Bobby's body in a shallow grave in her backyard.<ref name=\"DeadlyWomen\"/> Bobby was later interred in a [[mausoleum]] at Forest Hill Cemetery in Kansas City.\n\n==Execution==\nBobby's kidnapping and murder scandalized the nation and soon led to federal [[indictment]]s for Hall and Heady. Both pleaded guilty to kidnapping and murder, and were [[execution|executed]] together in the Missouri [[gas chamber]] on December 18, 1953.\n\nHeady was one of only two women since 1865 to be executed by federal authorities. The other one was [[Ethel Greenglass Rosenberg]]. Since the federal government did not have any execution facilities, it used Missouri's state facilities to carry out the execution.\n\nOnly $288,000 of the ransom money was recovered.

She notices a talking, clothed [[White Rabbit|white rabbit]] with a [[pocket watch]] run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it, she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled \"DRINK ME,\" the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table. She subsequently eats a cake labelled \"EAT ME\" in currants as the chapter closes.\n\n'''Chapter Two \u2013 The Pool of Tears''': The chapter opens with Alice growing to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling. Unhappy, Alice begins to cry and her tears literally flood the hallway. Shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up, Alice swims through her own tears and meets a [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|mouse]], who is swimming as well. Alice, thinking he may be a French mouse, tries to make small talk with him in elementary French. Her opening gambit \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" ({{Trans|\"Where is my cat?\"}}), however, offends the mouse, who then tries to escape her.\n\n'''Chapter Three \u2013 The Caucus Race and a Long Tale''': {{anchor|Caucus Race}}The sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again. Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on [[William the Conqueror]]. A [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|dodo]] decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.\n\n'''Chapter Four \u2013 The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill''': White Rabbit appears again in search of the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]]'s gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his [[maidservant]], Mary Ann, Rabbit orders Alice to go into the house and retrieve them. Inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from it, immediately beginning to grow again. The horrified Rabbit orders his gardener, [[Bill the Lizard]], to climb on the roof and go down the chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in size.\n\n'''Chapter Five \u2013 Advice from a Caterpillar''': Alice comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|blue caterpillar]] smoking a [[hookah]]. Caterpillar questions Alice, who begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by [[How Doth the Little Crocodile|her inability to remember a poem]]. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.\n\n[[File:De Alice's Abenteuer im Wunderland Carroll pic 23 edited 1 of 2.png|thumb|right|The [[Cheshire Cat]]]]\n'''Chapter Six \u2013 Pig and Pepper''': A fish-[[footman]] has an invitation for the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]] of the house, which he delivers to a frog-footman. Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning [[Cheshire Cat]]) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and, to Alice's surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the [[March Hare]]'s house. He disappears but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.\n\n'''Chapter Seven \u2013 A Mad Tea-Party''': Alice becomes a guest at a \"mad\" tea party along with the [[March Hare]], the [[The Hatter|Hatter]], and a very tired [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]], who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened moments later by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous \"[[why is a raven like a writing desk?]].\" The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Time Time] has punished him by eternally standing still at 6&nbsp;PM (tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to.\n\n[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|left|upright|Alice trying to play [[croquet]] with a [[Flamingo]].]]\n'''Chapter Eight \u2013 The Queen's Croquet Ground''': Alice leaves the tea party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]] hates white roses. A procession of more cards, kings and queens and even the White Rabbit enters the garden. Alice then meets the King and Queen. The Queen, a figure difficult to please, introduces her signature phrase \"Off with his head!\" which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction with a subject. Alice is invited (or some might say ordered) to play a game of croquet with the Queen and the rest of her subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos. Live flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and Alice once again meets the Cheshire Cat. The Queen of Hearts then orders the Cat to be beheaded, only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that can be seen of him. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, the Queen is prompted to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter.\n\n'''Chapter Nine \u2013 The Mock Turtle's Story''': The Duchess is brought to the croquet ground at Alice's request. She ruminates on finding morals in everything around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her on the threat of execution and she introduces Alice to the [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Gryphon]], who takes her to the [[Mock Turtle]]. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real turtle in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so they can play a game.\n\n{{anchor|Lobster Quadrille}}\n'''Chapter Ten \u2013 Lobster Quadrille''': The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance to the Lobster Quadrille, while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) \"[['Tis the Voice of the Lobster]]\". The Mock Turtle sings them \"Beautiful Soup\" during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for an impending trial.\n\n'''Chapter Eleven \u2013 Who Stole the Tarts?''': Alice attends a trial whereby the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]] is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals, including [[Bill the Lizard]], the White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter, and the judge is the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]].\nDuring the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily growing larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she has no right to grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and calls the dormouse's accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the questioning, and the Duchess's cook.\n\n'''Chapter Twelve \u2013 Alice's Evidence''': Alice is then called up as a witness. She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and the King orders the animals be placed back into their seats before the trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be gone, citing Rule 42 (\"All persons more than a mile high to leave the court\"), but Alice disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually refusing to hold her tongue, only to say, \"It's not that I was the one who stole the tarts in the first place\", in the process. Finally, the Queen confirms that Alice was the culprit responsible of stealing the tarts after all (which automatically pardons the Knave of Hearts of his charges), and shouts, \"Off with her head!\", but Alice is unafraid, calling them just a pack of cards; although Alice holds her own for a time, the card guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{further|List of minor characters in the Alice series}}\n\nThe main characters in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' are the following:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]\n* [[White Rabbit|The White Rabbit]]\n* [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Mouse]]\n* [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Dodo]]\n* [[Lory (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Lory]]\n* [[Eaglet (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Eaglet]]\n* [[Duck (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duck]]\n* [[Pat (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Pat]]\n* [[Bill the Lizard]]\n* [[The Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Puppy]]\n* [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Caterpillar]]\n* [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duchess]]\n* [[Cheshire Cat|The Cheshire Cat]]\n* [[The Hatter|The Mad Hatter]]\n* [[March Hare|The March Hare]]\n* [[The Dormouse]]\n* [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]]\n* [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The King of Hearts]]\n* [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Knave of Hearts]]\n* [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Gryphon]]\n* [[Mock Turtle|The Mock Turtle]]\n}}\n\n=== Character allusions ===\n[[File:Jessie Willcox Smith Boys and Girls in Bookland.jpg|thumb|[[Jessie Willcox Smith]]'s illustration of Alice surrounded by the characters of Wonderland.

For example, the \"Rabbit Hole\" symbolised the actual stairs in the back of the Christ Church's main hall.

[[Leon Coward|Dr Leon Coward]] asserts the book 'suffers' from \"readings which reflect today's fascination with postmodernism and psychology, rather than delving into an historically informed interpretation,\" and speculates that this has been partly driven by audiences encountering the narrative through a 'second-hand' source, explaining \"our impressions of the original text are based on a multiplicity of reinterpretations.

It is most likely that these are references to French lessons\u2014a common feature of a Victorian middle-class girl's upbringing. For example, in the second chapter Alice posits that the mouse may be French. She therefore chooses to speak the first sentence of her French lesson-book to it: \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" (\"Where is my cat?\"). In Henri Bu\u00e9's French translation, Alice posits that the mouse may be Italian and speaks Italian to it.\n\nPat's \"Digging for apples\" could be a [[cross-language pun]], as ''pomme de terre'' (literally; \"apple of the earth\") means potato and ''pomme'' means apple.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lewis Carroll|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V-g1dR6en90C&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22Digging+for+apples%22+alice+in+wonderland+potatoes#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955829-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as \"O Mouse\", based on her memory of the noun [[Declension|declensions]] \"in her brother's [[Instruction in Latin#Order of cases|Latin Grammar]], 'A mouse \u2013 of a mouse \u2013 to a mouse \u2013 a mouse \u2013 O mouse!'\" These words correspond to the first five of Latin's six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: ''mus'' ([[nominative]]), ''muris'' ([[genitive]]), ''muri'' ([[dative]]), ''murem'' ([[accusative]]), ''(O) mus'' ([[vocative]]). The sixth case, ''mure'' ([[ablative]]) is absent from Alice's recitation.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nAs Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church, it has been suggested<ref name=\"more_annotated\" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|title=Algebra in Wonderland|date=6 March 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 March 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312005347/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|archivedate=12 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserted in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' that Dodgson wrote ''Alice in Wonderland'' in its final form as a scathing satire on new modern mathematics that were emerging in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|title=Alice's adventures in algebra: Wonderland solved|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391.600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved.html?full=true|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nExamples of references to math in ''Alice'' include:\n\n* Chapter 1 (\"Down the Rabbit-Hole\"): in the midst of shrinking, Alice waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as, perhaps \"''going out altogether, like a candle''\"; this pondering reflects the concept of a [[limit of a function|limit]].\n* Chapter 2 (\"The Pool of Tears\"): Alice tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results: \"''Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!''\" This explores the representation of numbers using different [[Base (exponentiation)|bases]] and [[Positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system]]s: 4 \u00d7 5 = 12 in base 18 notation, 4 \u00d7 6 = 13 in base 21 notation, and 4 \u00d7 7 could be 14 in base 24 notation. Continuing this sequence, going up three bases each time, the result will continue to be less than 20 in the corresponding base notation. (After 4 \u00d7 12 = 19 in Base 39, the product would be 4 \u00d7 13 = 1A in Base 42, then 1B, 1C, 1D, and so on.)\n* Chapter 7 (\"A Mad Tea-Party\"): The March Hare, the Hatter, and the Dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of a sentence '''A''' is not the same value of the [[Antimetabole|converse]] of '''A''' (for example, \"''Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!''\"); in logic and mathematics, this is discussing a [[converse relation]]. Alice also ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning. This is an observation of addition on the [[ring of integers]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] N.\n* The Cheshire cat fades until it disappears entirely, leaving only its wide grin, suspended in the air, leading Alice to marvel and note that she has seen a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat. Deep abstraction of concepts, such as non-Euclidean geometry, abstract algebra, and the beginnings of mathematical logic, was taking over mathematics at the time Dodgson was writing. Dodgson's delineation of the relationship between cat and grin can be taken to represent the very concept of mathematics and number itself. For example, instead of considering two or three apples, one may easily consider the concept of 'apple', upon which the concepts of 'two' and 'three' may seem to depend. A far more sophisticated jump is to consider the concepts of 'two' and 'three' by themselves, just like a grin, originally seemingly dependent on the cat, separated conceptually from its physical object.\n\n=== Eating and devouring ===\nCarina Garland notes how the world is \"expressed via representations of food and appetite\", naming Alice's frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her 'Curious Appetites'.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1353/uni.2008.0004 |title = Curious Appetites: Food, Desire, Gender and Subjectivity in Lewis Carroll's Alice Texts |journal = The Lion and the Unicorn |volume = 32 |pages = 22\u201339 |year = 2008 |last1 = Garland |first1 = C. }}</ref> Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images.

At the release of ''Through the Looking-Glass'', the first Alice tale gained in popularity and by the end of the 19th century [[Sir Walter Besant]] wrote that ''Alice in Wonderland'' \"was a book of that extremely rare kind which will belong to all the generations to come until the language becomes obsolete\".<ref name=\":02\">{{cite book|author=Carpenter, Humphrey|url=https://archive.org/details/secretgardensstu00carp|title=Secret Gardens: The Golden Age of Children's Literature|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1985|isbn=978-0-395-35293-9|ref=Carpenter}}</ref>{{Rp|68}}\n\n== Adaptations and Influences ==\n{{Main|Works based on Alice in Wonderland|l1 = Works based on'' Alice in Wonderland''}}\nIn 2015, Robert Douglas-Fairhurst in ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote,\u201cSince the first publication of ''Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland'' 150 years ago, Lewis Carroll\u2019s work has spawned a whole industry, from films and theme park rides to products such as a 'cute and sassy' Alice costume ('petticoat and stockings not included').

Saville Clark (book) and [[Walter Slaughter]] (music), which played at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. The musical was frequently revived during West End Christmas seasons during the four decades after its premiere, including a London production at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] in 1888, with [[Isa Bowman]] as Alice.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Lewis Carroll in Wonderland and at Home: The Story of His Life | first=Belle | last=Moses | publisher=BiblioBazaar | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-103-29348-3 | pages=244\u2013247 }}</ref> \n\nAs the book and its sequel are Carroll's most widely recognised works, they have also inspired numerous live performances, including plays, operas, ballets, and traditional English [[pantomime]]s. These works range from fairly faithful adaptations to those that use the story as a basis for new works. An example of the latter is ''The Eighth Square'', a murder mystery set in Wonderland, written by [[Matthew Fleming]] and music and lyrics by Ben J. Macpherson. This goth-toned rock musical premiered in 2006 at the [[New Theatre Royal]] in [[Portsmouth]], England. The TA Fantastika, a popular [[Black light theatre]] in Prague performs \"Aspects of Alice\"; written and directed by Petr Kratochv\u00edl. This adaptation is not faithful to the books, but rather explores Alice's journey into adulthood while incorporating allusions to the history of Czech Republic.\n\nOver the years, many notable people in the performing arts have been involved in ''Alice'' productions. Actress [[Eva Le Gallienne]] famously adapted both Alice books for the stage in 1932; this production has been revived in New York in 1947 and 1982. One of the most well-known American productions was [[Joseph Papp]]'s 1980 staging of ''Alice in Concert'' at the [[Public Theater]] in New York City. [[Elizabeth Swados]] wrote the book, lyrics, and music. Based on both ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass'', Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. [[Meryl Streep]] played Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty. The cast also included [[Debbie Allen]], [[Michael Jeter]], and [[Mark Linn-Baker]]. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe. A community theater production of Alice was [[Olivia de Havilland]]'s first foray onto the stage.\n\nSimilarly, the 1992 operatic production ''Alice'' used both ''Alice'' books as its inspiration. It also employs scenes with Charles Dodgson, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story. Paul Schmidt wrote the play, with [[Tom Waits]] and [[Kathleen Brennan]] writing the music. Although the original production in [[Hamburg]], Germany, received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the album ''[[Alice (Tom Waits album)|Alice]]'' in 2002. A musical adaption was written by Michael Sirotta and Heather M. Dominick in 1997, titled ''Alice in Wonderland, a Musical Adventure''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winter Children's Theatre \"Alice in Wonderland\" Runs Through March 24th|url=http://www.northcoastoregon.com/2013/03/12/winter-childrens-theatre-alice-in-wonderland-runs-through-march-24th/|publisher=North Coast Oregon|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=First Redeemer conservatory of music and fine arts presents Alice in Wonderland|url=http://northfulton.com/stories/First-Redeemer-conservatory-of-music-and-fine-arts-presents-Alice-in-Wonderland,31808|publisher=APPEN MEDIA GROUP|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nA ballet by [[Christopher Wheeldon]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2056483,00.html |work=Time |title=Royal Ballet Takes a Chance on Alice |date=3 March 2011}}</ref> and [[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2432&State_3041=2&workId_3041=43051 |title=Joby Talbot \u2013 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (2010) \u2013 Music Sales Classical |publisher=Chesternovello.com |date= |accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref> commissioned for [[The Royal Ballet]] entitled \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" premiered in February 2011 at the [[Royal Opera House]] in Covent Garden, London.

She notices a talking, clothed [[White Rabbit|white rabbit]] with a [[pocket watch]] run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it, she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled \"DRINK ME,\" the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table. She subsequently eats a cake labelled \"EAT ME\" in currants as the chapter closes.\n\n'''Chapter Two \u2013 The Pool of Tears''': The chapter opens with Alice growing to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling. Unhappy, Alice begins to cry and her tears literally flood the hallway. Shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up, Alice swims through her own tears and meets a [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|mouse]], who is swimming as well. Alice, thinking he may be a French mouse, tries to make small talk with him in elementary French. Her opening gambit \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" ({{Trans|\"Where is my cat?\"}}), however, offends the mouse, who then tries to escape her.\n\n'''Chapter Three \u2013 The Caucus Race and a Long Tale''': {{anchor|Caucus Race}}The sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again. Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on [[William the Conqueror]]. A [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|dodo]] decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.\n\n'''Chapter Four \u2013 The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill''': White Rabbit appears again in search of the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]]'s gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his [[maidservant]], Mary Ann, Rabbit orders Alice to go into the house and retrieve them. Inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from it, immediately beginning to grow again. The horrified Rabbit orders his gardener, [[Bill the Lizard]], to climb on the roof and go down the chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in size.\n\n'''Chapter Five \u2013 Advice from a Caterpillar''': Alice comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|blue caterpillar]] smoking a [[hookah]]. Caterpillar questions Alice, who begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by [[How Doth the Little Crocodile|her inability to remember a poem]]. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.\n\n[[File:De Alice's Abenteuer im Wunderland Carroll pic 23 edited 1 of 2.png|thumb|right|The [[Cheshire Cat]]]]\n'''Chapter Six \u2013 Pig and Pepper''': A fish-[[footman]] has an invitation for the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]] of the house, which he delivers to a frog-footman. Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning [[Cheshire Cat]]) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and, to Alice's surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the [[March Hare]]'s house. He disappears but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.\n\n'''Chapter Seven \u2013 A Mad Tea-Party''': Alice becomes a guest at a \"mad\" tea party along with the [[March Hare]], the [[The Hatter|Hatter]], and a very tired [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]], who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened moments later by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous \"[[why is a raven like a writing desk?]].\" The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Time Time] has punished him by eternally standing still at 6&nbsp;PM (tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to.\n\n[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|left|upright|Alice trying to play [[croquet]] with a [[Flamingo]].]]\n'''Chapter Eight \u2013 The Queen's Croquet Ground''': Alice leaves the tea party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]] hates white roses. A procession of more cards, kings and queens and even the White Rabbit enters the garden. Alice then meets the King and Queen. The Queen, a figure difficult to please, introduces her signature phrase \"Off with his head!\" which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction with a subject. Alice is invited (or some might say ordered) to play a game of croquet with the Queen and the rest of her subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos. Live flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and Alice once again meets the Cheshire Cat. The Queen of Hearts then orders the Cat to be beheaded, only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that can be seen of him. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, the Queen is prompted to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter.\n\n'''Chapter Nine \u2013 The Mock Turtle's Story''': The Duchess is brought to the croquet ground at Alice's request. She ruminates on finding morals in everything around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her on the threat of execution and she introduces Alice to the [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Gryphon]], who takes her to the [[Mock Turtle]]. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real turtle in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so they can play a game.\n\n{{anchor|Lobster Quadrille}}\n'''Chapter Ten \u2013 Lobster Quadrille''': The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance to the Lobster Quadrille, while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) \"[['Tis the Voice of the Lobster]]\". The Mock Turtle sings them \"Beautiful Soup\" during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for an impending trial.\n\n'''Chapter Eleven \u2013 Who Stole the Tarts?''': Alice attends a trial whereby the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]] is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals, including [[Bill the Lizard]], the White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter, and the judge is the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]].\nDuring the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily growing larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she has no right to grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and calls the dormouse's accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the questioning, and the Duchess's cook.\n\n'''Chapter Twelve \u2013 Alice's Evidence''': Alice is then called up as a witness. She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and the King orders the animals be placed back into their seats before the trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be gone, citing Rule 42 (\"All persons more than a mile high to leave the court\"), but Alice disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually refusing to hold her tongue, only to say, \"It's not that I was the one who stole the tarts in the first place\", in the process. Finally, the Queen confirms that Alice was the culprit responsible of stealing the tarts after all (which automatically pardons the Knave of Hearts of his charges), and shouts, \"Off with her head!\", but Alice is unafraid, calling them just a pack of cards; although Alice holds her own for a time, the card guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{further|List of minor characters in the Alice series}}\n\nThe main characters in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' are the following:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]\n* [[White Rabbit|The White Rabbit]]\n* [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Mouse]]\n* [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Dodo]]\n* [[Lory (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Lory]]\n* [[Eaglet (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Eaglet]]\n* [[Duck (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duck]]\n* [[Pat (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Pat]]\n* [[Bill the Lizard]]\n* [[The Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Puppy]]\n* [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Caterpillar]]\n* [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duchess]]\n* [[Cheshire Cat|The Cheshire Cat]]\n* [[The Hatter|The Mad Hatter]]\n* [[March Hare|The March Hare]]\n* [[The Dormouse]]\n* [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]]\n* [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The King of Hearts]]\n* [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Knave of Hearts]]\n* [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Gryphon]]\n* [[Mock Turtle|The Mock Turtle]]\n}}\n\n=== Character allusions ===\n[[File:Jessie Willcox Smith Boys and Girls in Bookland.jpg|thumb|[[Jessie Willcox Smith]]'s illustration of Alice surrounded by the characters of Wonderland.

We don't necessarily realise we're missing anything in understanding the original product, because we're usually never dealing ''with'' the original product.\"<ref name=\"Coward 18\" />\n\n=== Language ===\nIt has been suggested by several people, including [[Martin Gardner]] and Selwyn Goodacre,<ref name=\"more_annotated\">{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|url=https://archive.org/details/moreannotatedali00carr/page/363|title=More Annotated Alice|publisher=Random House|year=1990|isbn=978-0-394-58571-0|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/moreannotatedali00carr/page/363 363]}}</ref> that Dodgson had an interest in the French language, choosing to make references and puns about it in the story. It is most likely that these are references to French lessons\u2014a common feature of a Victorian middle-class girl's upbringing. For example, in the second chapter Alice posits that the mouse may be French. She therefore chooses to speak the first sentence of her French lesson-book to it: \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" (\"Where is my cat?\"). In Henri Bu\u00e9's French translation, Alice posits that the mouse may be Italian and speaks Italian to it.\n\nPat's \"Digging for apples\" could be a [[cross-language pun]], as ''pomme de terre'' (literally; \"apple of the earth\") means potato and ''pomme'' means apple.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lewis Carroll|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V-g1dR6en90C&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22Digging+for+apples%22+alice+in+wonderland+potatoes#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955829-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as \"O Mouse\", based on her memory of the noun [[Declension|declensions]] \"in her brother's [[Instruction in Latin#Order of cases|Latin Grammar]], 'A mouse \u2013 of a mouse \u2013 to a mouse \u2013 a mouse \u2013 O mouse!'\" These words correspond to the first five of Latin's six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: ''mus'' ([[nominative]]), ''muris'' ([[genitive]]), ''muri'' ([[dative]]), ''murem'' ([[accusative]]), ''(O) mus'' ([[vocative]]). The sixth case, ''mure'' ([[ablative]]) is absent from Alice's recitation.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nAs Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church, it has been suggested<ref name=\"more_annotated\" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|title=Algebra in Wonderland|date=6 March 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 March 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312005347/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|archivedate=12 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserted in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' that Dodgson wrote ''Alice in Wonderland'' in its final form as a scathing satire on new modern mathematics that were emerging in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|title=Alice's adventures in algebra: Wonderland solved|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391.600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved.html?full=true|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nExamples of references to math in ''Alice'' include:\n\n* Chapter 1 (\"Down the Rabbit-Hole\"): in the midst of shrinking, Alice waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as, perhaps \"''going out altogether, like a candle''\"; this pondering reflects the concept of a [[limit of a function|limit]].\n* Chapter 2 (\"The Pool of Tears\"): Alice tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results: \"''Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!''\" This explores the representation of numbers using different [[Base (exponentiation)|bases]] and [[Positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system]]s: 4 \u00d7 5 = 12 in base 18 notation, 4 \u00d7 6 = 13 in base 21 notation, and 4 \u00d7 7 could be 14 in base 24 notation. Continuing this sequence, going up three bases each time, the result will continue to be less than 20 in the corresponding base notation. (After 4 \u00d7 12 = 19 in Base 39, the product would be 4 \u00d7 13 = 1A in Base 42, then 1B, 1C, 1D, and so on.)\n* Chapter 7 (\"A Mad Tea-Party\"): The March Hare, the Hatter, and the Dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of a sentence '''A''' is not the same value of the [[Antimetabole|converse]] of '''A''' (for example, \"''Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!''\"); in logic and mathematics, this is discussing a [[converse relation]]. Alice also ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning. This is an observation of addition on the [[ring of integers]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] N.\n* The Cheshire cat fades until it disappears entirely, leaving only its wide grin, suspended in the air, leading Alice to marvel and note that she has seen a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat. Deep abstraction of concepts, such as non-Euclidean geometry, abstract algebra, and the beginnings of mathematical logic, was taking over mathematics at the time Dodgson was writing. Dodgson's delineation of the relationship between cat and grin can be taken to represent the very concept of mathematics and number itself. For example, instead of considering two or three apples, one may easily consider the concept of 'apple', upon which the concepts of 'two' and 'three' may seem to depend. A far more sophisticated jump is to consider the concepts of 'two' and 'three' by themselves, just like a grin, originally seemingly dependent on the cat, separated conceptually from its physical object.\n\n=== Eating and devouring ===\nCarina Garland notes how the world is \"expressed via representations of food and appetite\", naming Alice's frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her 'Curious Appetites'.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1353/uni.2008.0004 |title = Curious Appetites: Food, Desire, Gender and Subjectivity in Lewis Carroll's Alice Texts |journal = The Lion and the Unicorn |volume = 32 |pages = 22\u201339 |year = 2008 |last1 = Garland |first1 = C. }}</ref> Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images.

Saville Clark (book) and [[Walter Slaughter]] (music), which played at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. The musical was frequently revived during West End Christmas seasons during the four decades after its premiere, including a London production at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] in 1888, with [[Isa Bowman]] as Alice.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Lewis Carroll in Wonderland and at Home: The Story of His Life | first=Belle | last=Moses | publisher=BiblioBazaar | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-103-29348-3 | pages=244\u2013247 }}</ref> \n\nAs the book and its sequel are Carroll's most widely recognised works, they have also inspired numerous live performances, including plays, operas, ballets, and traditional English [[pantomime]]s. These works range from fairly faithful adaptations to those that use the story as a basis for new works. An example of the latter is ''The Eighth Square'', a murder mystery set in Wonderland, written by [[Matthew Fleming]] and music and lyrics by Ben J. Macpherson. This goth-toned rock musical premiered in 2006 at the [[New Theatre Royal]] in [[Portsmouth]], England. The TA Fantastika, a popular [[Black light theatre]] in Prague performs \"Aspects of Alice\"; written and directed by Petr Kratochv\u00edl. This adaptation is not faithful to the books, but rather explores Alice's journey into adulthood while incorporating allusions to the history of Czech Republic.\n\nOver the years, many notable people in the performing arts have been involved in ''Alice'' productions. Actress [[Eva Le Gallienne]] famously adapted both Alice books for the stage in 1932; this production has been revived in New York in 1947 and 1982. One of the most well-known American productions was [[Joseph Papp]]'s 1980 staging of ''Alice in Concert'' at the [[Public Theater]] in New York City. [[Elizabeth Swados]] wrote the book, lyrics, and music. Based on both ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass'', Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. [[Meryl Streep]] played Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty. The cast also included [[Debbie Allen]], [[Michael Jeter]], and [[Mark Linn-Baker]]. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe. A community theater production of Alice was [[Olivia de Havilland]]'s first foray onto the stage.\n\nSimilarly, the 1992 operatic production ''Alice'' used both ''Alice'' books as its inspiration. It also employs scenes with Charles Dodgson, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story. Paul Schmidt wrote the play, with [[Tom Waits]] and [[Kathleen Brennan]] writing the music. Although the original production in [[Hamburg]], Germany, received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the album ''[[Alice (Tom Waits album)|Alice]]'' in 2002. A musical adaption was written by Michael Sirotta and Heather M. Dominick in 1997, titled ''Alice in Wonderland, a Musical Adventure''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winter Children's Theatre \"Alice in Wonderland\" Runs Through March 24th|url=http://www.northcoastoregon.com/2013/03/12/winter-childrens-theatre-alice-in-wonderland-runs-through-march-24th/|publisher=North Coast Oregon|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=First Redeemer conservatory of music and fine arts presents Alice in Wonderland|url=http://northfulton.com/stories/First-Redeemer-conservatory-of-music-and-fine-arts-presents-Alice-in-Wonderland,31808|publisher=APPEN MEDIA GROUP|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nA ballet by [[Christopher Wheeldon]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2056483,00.html |work=Time |title=Royal Ballet Takes a Chance on Alice |date=3 March 2011}}</ref> and [[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2432&State_3041=2&workId_3041=43051 |title=Joby Talbot \u2013 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (2010) \u2013 Music Sales Classical |publisher=Chesternovello.com |date= |accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref> commissioned for [[The Royal Ballet]] entitled \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" premiered in February 2011 at the [[Royal Opera House]] in Covent Garden, London.

Ultimately, Spain conquered Mexico and thereby gained substantial access to the [[Pacific Ocean]], which meant that the [[Spanish Empire]] could finally achieve its original oceanic goal of reaching the Asian markets.\n\n==Early events==\n{{Main|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}\n\n===The road to Tenochtitlan===\nIn April 1519 [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], an ambitious nobleman recently landed in Cuba, and the leader of the third Spanish expedition to the coast of Mexico, landed as directed by the survivors of the previous two expeditions at [[San Juan de Ul\u00faa]], a good harbour on Mexico's east coast, with 508 soldiers, 100 sailors, and 14 small cannons. [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar|Governor Vel\u00e1zquez]], the Governor of Cuba, called for Cort\u00e9s to lead an expedition into Mexico after favourable reports from two previous expeditions to Yucat\u00e1n caught the interest of the Spanish in Cuba.<ref name=\"PBS\">[https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_flat.html Conquistadors, with Michael Wood]&nbsp;\u2013 website for 2001 PBS documentary</ref> Under the pressure of his relatives who had a different leader in mind, Vel\u00e1zquez regretted his decision and revoked Cort\u00e9s' mandate to lead the expedition even before Cort\u00e9s left Cuba. Thus Cort\u00e9s had to fight for his survival as a leader while still in Cuba; twice the messengers of Vel\u00e1squez arrived to depose him, and twice they were spoken to with honeyed words and dissuaded from executing their mission. After Cort\u00e9s sailed, Vel\u00e1zquez sent an army led by [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] to take him into custody.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nBut Cort\u00e9s used the same legal tactic used by Governor Vel\u00e1zquez when he invaded Cuba years before: he created a local government and had himself elected as the magistrate, thus (in theory) making him responsible only to the King of Spain. Cort\u00e9s followed this tactic when he and his men established the city of ''Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz'', also known as [[Veracruz]], seven miles from the harbour of San Juan de Ulua. An inquiry into Cort\u00e9s' action was conducted in Spain in 1529 and no action was taken against him.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nCort\u00e9s chanced to land at the borders of Cempoala, a recently Aztec-subdued vassal state with many grievances against them. Coming into contact with a number of polities who resented Aztec rule, Cort\u00e9s claimed he has arrived on the orders of his Emperor to put things in order, abolish human sacrifices, teach the locals the true faith and \"stop them from robbing each other\", and was successful in enforcing excellent behaviour of his army when among potential allies. Cort\u00e9s clashed with some of these polities, among them the [[Totonac people|Totonacs]] and [[Tlaxcaltec|Tlaxcalans]]. The latter gave him two good day battles and one night battle, and kept up a strong defense, holding off his army on a hilltop for two weeks. His numerically inferior force finally triumphed when the minds of Tlaxcalans opened up to consideration of his ceaseless offers of peace, notably [[Xicotencatl the Elder]] and his wish to form an alliance with the Spaniards against the Aztecs which was the proffered aim of Cort\u00e9s as well.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIt once was widely believed that the Aztecs first thought Cort\u00e9s was [[Quetzalcoatl]], a mythical god prophesied to return to Mexico\u2014coincidentally in the same year Cort\u00e9s landed and from the same direction he came. This is now believed{{when|date=August 2015}} to be an invention of the conquerors, and perhaps natives who wished to rationalize the actions of the Aztec ''[[tlatoani]]'', [[Moctezuma II]]. Most scholars{{Who|date=August 2015}} agree that the Aztecs, especially the inner circle around Moctezuma, were well convinced that Cort\u00e9s was not a god in any shape or form.<ref>\"The Mexico Reader: History, Culture, Politics\". Joseph, Gilbert M. and Henderson, Timothy J. Duke University Press, 2002.{{page needed|date=November 2010}}</ref> Messages between Cort\u00e9s and Moctezuma, however, frequently allude to the legend, which was widely known across the Aztec dominions to both Aztecs and their subjects, and strongly influenced them, as Bernal Diaz del Castillo repeatedly mentions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nMoctezuma sent a group of noblemen and other emissaries to meet Cort\u00e9s at Quauhtechcac.

As news about the strangers reached the capital city, Moctezuma became increasingly fearful and considered fleeing the city but resigned himself to what he considered to be the fate of his people.<ref name=\"Le\u00f3n Portilla\">\"Visi\u00f3n de los vencidos.\" Le\u00f3n-Portilla, Miguel (Ed.)

Before entering the city, on November 8, 1519, Cort\u00e9s and his troops prepared themselves for battle, armoring themselves and their horses, and arranging themselves in proper military rank. Four horsemen were at the lead of the procession. Behind these horsemen were five more contingents: foot soldiers with iron swords and wooden or leather shields; horsemen in cuirasses, armed with iron lances, swords, and wooden shields; crossbowmen; more horsemen; soldiers armed with [[arquebus]]es; lastly, native peoples from Tlaxcalan, Tliliuhquitepec, and Huexotzinco. The indigenous soldiers wore cotton armor and were armed with shields and crossbows; many carried provisions in baskets or bundles while others escorted the cannons on wooden carts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nCort\u00e9s' army entered the city on the flower-covered causeway from [[Iztapalapa]], associated with the god Quetzalcoatl. Cort\u00e9s was amicably received by Moctezuma. The captive woman Malinalli Ten\u00e9pal, also known as [[Do\u00f1a Marina]], translated from Nahuatl to [[Chontal Maya language|Chontal Maya]]; the Spaniard [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Aguilar]] translated from Chontal Maya to Spanish.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nMoctezuma was soon taken hostage on November 14, 1519, as a safety measure by the vastly outnumbered Spanish. Another reason for his sudden capture was news that Moctezuma received from one of his messengers. It was reported to Moctezuma that at least eight hundred more Spaniards in thirteen great ships had arrived on the coast. Moctezuma received this information a few days before Cort\u00e9s did. Cort\u00e9s had been communicating to the crown that he had the entire situation under control and was practically running the city of Tenochtitlan. With the vast new Spanish ships forces on the horizon, sent by his enemy Diego Velasquez, they could only revoke his commission and recall him, thus ending his campaign in Mexico and probably dooming the Spanish attempt for a lightning conquest, as no other Spanish leader could wield authority as effectively both among the natives and the Spaniards. Therefore, Cort\u00e9s made the decision to abruptly abduct the King; only with a knife to his throat could Cort\u00e9s ensure his cooperation.<ref>\"Malintzin's Choices\" Camilla Townsend University of New Mexico Press, 2006</ref> According to all eyewitness accounts, Moctezuma initially refused to leave his palace but after a series of threats from and debates with the Spanish captains, and assurances from Do\u00f1a Marina, he agreed to move to the Axay\u00e1ctal palace with his retinue. The first captain assigned to guard him was [[Pedro de Alvarado]]. Other Aztec lords were also detained by the Spanish, when they started questioning their captive King's authority.<ref name=\"Sahagun\"/> The palace was surrounded by over 100 Spanish soldiers in order to prevent any attempt at rescue.<ref name=\"Cervantes Salazar\">Cervantes de Salazar, Francisco. \"Cr\u00f3nica de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a. Madrid: Linkgua Ediciones, 2007.{{page needed|date=November 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Tensions mount between Aztecs and Spaniards===\nIt is uncertain why Moctezuma cooperated so readily with the Spaniards. It is possible he feared losing his life or political power; however, one of the effective threats wielded by Cort\u00e9s was the destruction of his beautiful city in the case of fighting between Spaniards and Aztecs (which ultimately came to pass). This Moctezuma at all costs wanted to avoid, vacillating and deferring the rupture until this policy claimed his life. It was clear from the beginning that he was ambivalent about who Cort\u00e9s and his men really were, whether they be gods, descendants of a god, ambassadors from a greater king, or just barbaric invaders. From the perspective of the tlatoani, the Spaniards might have been assigned some decisive role by fate. It could also have been a tactical move: Moctezuma may have wanted to gather more information on the Spaniards, or to wait for the end of the agricultural season and strike at the beginning of the war season.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} However, he did not carry out either of these actions even though high-ranking military leaders such as his brother [[Cuitlahuac]] and nephew [[Cacamatzin]] urged him to do so.<ref name=\"Hassig\">Hassig, Ross.  ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest''.  New York: Longman, 1994.{{page needed|date=November 2010}}</ref>\n\nWith Moctezuma captive, Cort\u00e9s did not need to worry about being cut off from supplies or being attacked, although some of his captains had such concerns. He also assumed that he could control the Aztecs through Moctezuma. However, Cort\u00e9s had little knowledge of the ruling system of the Aztecs; Moctezuma was not all-powerful as Cort\u00e9s imagined. Being appointed to and maintaining the position of tlatoani was based on the ability to rule decisively; he could be replaced by another noble if he failed to do so. At any sign of weakness, Aztec nobles within Tenochtitlan and in other Aztec tributaries were liable to rebel. As Moctezuma complied with orders issued by Cort\u00e9s, such as commanding tribute to be gathered and given to the Spaniards, his authority was slipping, and quickly his people began to turn against him.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\nCort\u00e9s and his army were permitted to stay in the Palace of Axayacatl, and tensions continued to grow. While the Spaniards were in Tenochtitlan, Vel\u00e1zquez assembled a force of nineteen ships, more than 1400 soldiers with twenty cannons, eighty horsemen, one-hundred and twenty crossbowmen, and eighty arquebusiers under the command of [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] to capture Cort\u00e9s and return him to Cuba. Vel\u00e1zquez felt that Cort\u00e9s had exceeded his authority, and had been aware of Cort\u00e9s's misconduct for nearly a year. He had to wait for favorable winds, though, and was unable to send any forces until spring. Narv\u00e1ez's troops landed at San Juan de Ul\u00faa on the Mexican coast around April 20, 1520.<ref>Hassig (2006, p. 107).</ref>\n\nAfter Cort\u00e9s became aware of their arrival, he left Pedro de Alvarado in charge in Tenochtitlan with 80 soldiers, and brought all his forces (about two hundred and forty men) by quick marches to Narv\u00e1ez's camp in Cempohuallan on May 27. Several negotiations between the two Spaniards took place on the way, in which Cort\u00e9s was able to persuade many persons of weight in Narv\u00e1ez's camp to incline to his side. Cort\u00e9s attacked Narv\u00e1ez's camp late at night; his men, much superior in experience and organization, wounded Narv\u00e1ez in the eye and took him as a hostage quickly; also taken were his principal adherents, de Salvatierra and Diego Velasquez (the nephew of the Governor of Cuba). Evidence suggests that the two were in the midst of negotiations at the time, and Narv\u00e1ez was not expecting an attack. Cort\u00e9s then completed winning over Narv\u00e1ez's captains with promises of the vast wealth in Tenochtitlan, inducing them to follow him back to the Aztec capital. Narv\u00e1ez was imprisoned in Vera Cruz, and his army was integrated into Cort\u00e9s's forces.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\n==Rapid deterioration of relations==\n\n===Massacre at the festival of T\u00f3xcatl===\n{{Main|Massacre in the Great Temple}}\n[[File:Alvarado.jpeg|thumb|200px|Conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]].]]\nDuring Cort\u00e9s's absence, [[Pedro de Alvarado]] was left in command in Tenochtitlan with 80 soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAt this time, the Aztecs began to prepare for the annual festival of [[Toxcatl]] in early May, in honor of [[Tezcatlipoca]], otherwise known as the Smoking Mirror or the Omnipotent Power. They honored this god during the onset of the dry season so that the god would fill dry streambeds and cause rain to fall on crops. Moctezuma secured the consent of Cort\u00e9s to hold the festival, and again confirmed permission with Alvarado.<ref name=\"Levy, Buddy 2008\">Levy, Buddy, Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stands of the Aztecs, (New York: Bantam Books, 2008), 163\u201364.</ref>\n\nAlvarado agreed to allow the festival on the condition that there would be no human sacrifice, but the Toxcatl festival had featured human sacrifice as the main part of its climactic rituals. The sacrifice involved the killing of a young man who had been impersonating the Toxcatl deity for a full year. Thus, prohibiting human sacrifice during this festival was an untenable proposition for the Aztecs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nBefore the festival, Alvarado encountered a group of women building a statue of [[Huitzilopochtli]] and the image unsettled him, and he became suspicious about the eventuality of human sacrifice. He tortured priests and nobles and discovered that the Aztecs were planning a revolt. Unable to assert control over events, he sequestered Moctezuma and increased the guards around the tlatoani.<ref>Levy, Buddy, Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stands of the Aztecs, (New York: Bantam Books, 2008), 166.</ref>\n\nBy the day of the festival, the Aztecs had gathered on the Patio of Dances. Alvarado had sixty of his men as well as many of his Tlaxcalan allies into positions around the patio. The Aztecs initiated the Serpent Dance. The euphoric dancing as well as the accompanying flute and drum playing disturbed Alvarado about the potential for revolt. He ordered the gates closed and initiated the killing of many thousands of Aztec nobles, warriors and priests.<ref>Levy, Buddy, Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stands of the Aztecs, (New York: Bantam Books, 2008), 168\u201370.</ref>\n\nAlvarado, the conquistadors and the Tlaxcalans retreated to their base in the Palace of Axayacatl and secured the entrances. Alvarado ordered his men to shoot their cannons, crossbows and arquebuses into the gathering crowd. The result either preempted or triggered the Aztec revolt, which was, however, inevitable from the moment of Moctezuma's capture and was accelerated by the split of the Spanish forces. Alvarado forced Moctezuma to appeal to the crowd outside the Palace and this appeal temporarily calmed them.<ref>Levy, Buddy, Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stands of the Aztecs, (New York: Bantam Books, 2008), 170\u201371.</ref>\n\nThe massacre had the result of resolutely turning all the Aztecs against the Spanish and completely undermining Moctezuma's authority.<ref>Levy, Buddy, Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stands of the Aztecs, (New York: Bantam Books, 2008), 171.</ref>\n\n===Aztec revolt===\nAlvarado sent word to Cort\u00e9s of the events, and Cort\u00e9s hurried back to Tenochtitlan on June 24 with 1,300 soldiers, 96 horses, 80 crossbowmen, and 80 arquebusiers. Cort\u00e9s also came with 2,000 Tlaxcalan warriors on the journey.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/> Cort\u00e9s entered the palace unscathed, as the hostilities had not started yet, although the Aztecs had probably planned to ambush him. The Aztecs had already stopped sending food and supplies to the Spaniards. They became suspicious and watched for people trying to sneak supplies to them; many innocent people were slaughtered because they were suspected of helping them.<ref name=\"spears\">*{{cite book |author=Le\u00f3n-Portilla, Miguel (Ed.) |authorlink=Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla |year=1992 |origyear=1959 |title=The Broken Spears: The Aztec Account of the Conquest of Mexico |others=[[\u00c1ngel Mar\u00eda Garibay K.]] (Nahuatl-Spanish trans.), Lysander Kemp (Spanish-English trans.), Alberto Beltran (illus.) |edition=Expanded and updated |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |isbn=0-8070-5501-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/brokenspearsa00leon }}</ref> A few days after the great forces of Cort\u00e9s got into Tenochtitlan, the roads were shut and the causeway bridges were raised.

Popular tales say Cort\u00e9s wept under a tree the night of the massacre of his troops at the hands of the Aztecs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nInitially, Cort\u00e9s resolved to fight the Aztec troops opposed to him and win the city in direct conflict. This stemmed from three errors of judgment:{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n1. Underestimation of the Aztecs. Cort\u00e9s fought the Tabascans, the Cempoalans, the Tlaxcalans and found them strong opponents, but always prevailed. He had never fought an Aztec army before and did not expect such resolve and martial skill as he encountered - although all his previous foes warned that the Mexicans were the greatest warriors they had ever seen and could not be withstood within their city.\n\n2. Overrating his forces. Since Cort\u00e9s won all his battles in Mexico before this while at the head of much inferior forces, being in charge of a nearly full Spanish tercio must have made him feel invincible. In fact, the only serviceable portion of his army were his old followers with great experience of Mexican warfare, who were by this time severely whittled down by wounds and disease. The newly-arrived Narva\u00e9z's men did not have experience in local fighting and were worth much less in combat - and eventually perished in much greater numbers than the veterans.\n\n3. Unprepared for enemy tactics. The Aztecs had fought for the lake cities many times before and their tactics were excellent - the use of canoes, the use of flat roofs with prepared missiles, dropping down into the lake when cornered, and destroying bridges. Cavalry could not operate in these conditions and control of the water was crucial, which Cort\u00e9s did not realize at first.\n\nWith this mindset, Cort\u00e9s launched an attack directly at the chief temple of the city, the Cue of Huichilopotzli. In spite of determined opposition, the Spanish push got them to the top of the temple's 114 steps, but at a great loss. Cort\u00e9s aimed at routing the Aztecs and by holding both Moctezuma and the great temple - being able to offer peace once again. However, the Spanish attack encountered such fierce resistance and numerous fatalities among his men, that the plan fell apart. The retreat to Spanish quarters was as hard as the attack, and part of their quarters were plundered in the meantime. The direct loss of nearly a hundred men dead and the fierce spirit of the Aztecs who refused to be cowed by his ascent of the temple convinced Cort\u00e9s that a night escape was now his only option for survival.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThough a flight from the city would make Cort\u00e9s appear weak before his indigenous allies, it was this or death for the Spanish forces. Cort\u00e9s and his men were in the center of the city, and would most likely have to fight their way out no matter what direction they took. Cort\u00e9s wanted to flee to Tlaxcala, so a path directly east would have been most favorable. Nevertheless, this would require hundreds of canoes to move all of Cort\u00e9s's people and supplies, which he was unable to procure in his position.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\nCort\u00e9s therefore had to choose among three land routes: north to Tlatelolco, which was the least dangerous path but required the longest trip through the city; south to Coyohuacan and Iztapalapa, two towns that would not welcome the Spanish; or west to Tlacopan, which required the shortest trip through Tenochtitlan, though they would not be welcome there either. Cort\u00e9s decided on the west causeway to Tlacopan, needing the quickest route out of Tenochtitlan with all his provisions and people.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\nHeavy rains and a moonless night provided some cover for the escaping Spanish.<ref name=\"serge\"/> On that \"Sad Night,\" July 1, 1520, the Spanish forces exited the palace first with their indigenous allies close behind, bringing as much treasure as possible. Cort\u00e9s had hoped to go undetected by muffling the horses' hooves and carrying wooden boards to cross the canals.\nThe Spanish forces were able to pass through the first three canals, the Tecpantzinco, Tzapotlan, and Atenchicalco.<ref name=\"spears\"/>\n\nHowever, they were discovered on the fourth canal at Mixcoatechialtitlan. One account says a woman fetching water saw them and alerted the city, another says it was a sentry. Some Aztecs set out in canoes, others by road to Nonchualco then Tlacopan to cut the Spanish off. The Aztecs attacked the fleeing Spanish on the Tlacopan causeway from canoes, shooting arrows at them. The Spanish fired their crossbows and arquebuses, but were unable to see their attackers or get into formation. Many Spaniards leaped into the water and drowned, weighed down by armor and booty.<ref name=\"spears\"/>\n\nWhen faced with a gap in the causeway, Alvarado made the famous \"leap of Alvarado\" using a spear to get to the other side. Approximately a third of the Spaniards succeeding in reaching the mainland, while the remaining ones died in battle or were captured and later sacrificed on Aztec altars - these were reported to be mostly the followers of Narvaez, less experienced and more weighted down with gold, which was handed out freely before the escape.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAfter crossing over the bridge, the surviving Spanish had little reprieve before the Aztecs appeared to attack and chase them towards Tlacopan. When they arrived at Tlacopan, a good number of Spaniards had been killed, as well as most of the indigenous warriors, and some of the horses; all of the cannons and most of the crossbows and other weapons were lost. In all battles with main Aztec forces after that, Spaniards noted their lost arms being used against them.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/> The Spanish finally found refuge in Otancalpolco, where they were aided by the Teocalhueyacans. The morning after, the Aztecs returned to recover the spoils from the canals.<ref name=\"spears\"/>\n\nTo reach Tlaxcala, Cort\u00e9s had to bring his troops around Lake Texcoco. Though the Spanish were under attack the entire trip, because Cort\u00e9s took his troops through the northern towns, they were at an advantage. The northern valley was less populous, travel was difficult, and it was still the agricultural season, so the attacks on Cort\u00e9s's forces were not very heavy. As Cort\u00e9s arrived in more densely inhabited areas east of the lake, the attacks were more forceful.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\n=== Battle of Otumba ===\n{{Further|Battle of Otumba}}\n\n[[File:The battle of Otumba.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Battle of Otumba]]]]\nBefore reaching Tlaxcala, the scanty Spanish forces arrived at the plain of [[Otumba de G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas|Otumba Valley (Otompan)]], where they were met by a vast Aztec army intent on their destruction. The Aztecs intended to cut short the Spanish retreat from Tenochtitlan and annihilate them. Here, the Aztecs made their own errors of judgement by underestimating the shock value of the Spanish [[Knight|caballeros]] because all they had seen was the horses traveling gingerly on the wet paved streets of Tenochtitlan. They had never seen them used in open battle on the plains. By marshalling on an open plain, they also allowed experienced Spanish commanders to bring to bear their own tactics, weaponry, and the know-how of European warfare.<ref name=\"serge\"/>\n\nDespite the overwhelming numbers of Aztecs and the generally poor condition of the Spanish survivors, Cort\u00e9s snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. He spotted the Aztec commander in his ornate and colourful feather [[tlahuiztli]] and immediately charged him with several horsemen, killing the Aztec commander and most other leaders as they were clearly marked by their golden plumage and an easy target for a charge. The many Tlaxcalan allies of the Spanish are mentioned as playing an important role in the battle, armed with Spanish swords and shields. The Spanish suffered some losses, but were victorious over the Aztecs, who then retreated and were pursued by cavalry.<ref name=\"serge\"/>\n\nWhen Cort\u00e9s finally reached Tlaxcala five days after fleeing Tenochtitlan, he had lost over 860 Spanish soldiers, over a thousand Tlaxcalans, as well as Spanish women who had accompanied Narv\u00e1ez's troops.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/> Cort\u00e9s claimed only 15 Spaniards were lost along with 2,000 native allies. Cano, another primary source, gives 1,150 Spaniards dead, though this figure was likely too high and might encompass the total loss from entering Mexico to arriving into Tlaxcala. Cort\u00e9s' chaplain back in Spain, [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]], estimated that 450 Spaniards and 4,000 allies had died. Other sources estimate that nearly half of the Spanish and almost all of the natives were killed or wounded.<ref name=\"serge\"/>\n\nThe women survivors included Cort\u00e9s's translator and lover [[La Malinche]], [[Mar\u00eda Estrada]], and two of Moctezuma's daughters who had been given to Cort\u00e9s, including the emperor's favorite and reportedly most beautiful daughter Tecuichpotzin (later Do\u00f1a [[Isabel Moctezuma]]). A third daughter died, leaving behind her infant by Cort\u00e9s, the mysterious second \"Mar\u00eda\" named in his will.\n\n==Both sides attempt to recover==\n\n===Shifting alliances===\nCuitl\u00e1huac had been elected as the emperor immediately following Moctezuma's death. It was necessary for him to prove his power and authority to keep the tributaries from revolting. Usually, the new king would take his army on a campaign before coronation; this demonstration would solidify necessary ties. However, Cuitl\u00e1huac was not in a position to do this, as it was not yet war season; therefore, allegiance to the Spanish seemed to be an option for many tributaries. The Aztec empire was very susceptible to division: most of the tributary states were divided internally, and their loyalty to the Aztecs was based either on their own interests or fear of punishment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIt was necessary for Cort\u00e9s to rebuild his alliances after his escape from Tenochtitlan before he could try again to take the city. He started with the Tlaxcalans. Tlaxcala was an autonomous state, and a fierce enemy of the Aztecs. Another strong motivation to join forces with the Spanish was that Tlaxcala was encircled by Aztec tributaries. The Tlaxcalans could have crushed the Spaniards at this point or turned them over to the Aztecs. In fact, the Aztecs sent emissaries promising peace and prosperity if they would do just that. The Tlaxcalan leaders rebuffed the overtures of the Aztec emissaries, deciding to continue their friendship with Cort\u00e9s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nCort\u00e9s managed to negotiate an alliance; however, the Tlaxcalans required heavy concessions from Cort\u00e9s for their continued support, which he was to provide after they defeated the Aztecs. They expected the Spanish to pay for their supplies, to have the city of Cholula, an equal share of any of the spoils, the right to build a citadel in Tenochtitlan, and finally, to be exempted from any future tribute. Cort\u00e9s was willing to promise anything in the name of the King of Spain, and agreed to their demands. The Spanish did complain about having to pay for their food and water with their gold and other jewels with which they had escaped Tenochtitlan. The Spanish authorities would later disown this treaty with the Tlaxcalans after the fall of Tenochtitlan.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nCort\u00e9s needed to gain other new allies as well. If the Spaniards were able to prove they could protect their new allies from the possibility of Aztec retribution, changing sides would not be too difficult for other tributaries. After Cort\u00e9s' forces managed to defeat the smaller armies of some Aztec tributary states, Tepeyac, and later, Yauhtepec and Cuauhnahuac were easily won over. Cort\u00e9s also used political maneuvering to assure the allegiance of other states, such as Tetzcoco. In addition, Cort\u00e9s replaced kings with those who he knew would be loyal to him. Cort\u00e9s now controlled many major towns, which simultaneously bolstered Cort\u00e9s's forces while weakening the Aztecs.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\nThough the largest group of indigenous allies were Tlaxcalans, the Huexotzinco, Atlixco, Tliliuhqui-Tepecs, Tetzcocans, Chalca, Alcohua and Tepanecs were all important allies as well, and had all been previously subjugated by the Aztecs.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/><ref name=\"serge\"/>\n\nEven the former Triple Alliance member, city of Tetzcoco (or [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]) became a Spanish ally. As the rebellion attempt led by the Tetzcocan Tlatoani, [[Cacamatzin]], in times of Moctezuma's reclusion was conjured by the Spanish,<ref name=\"Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.antorcha.net/biblioteca_virtual/historia/bernal/44.html|title=Capitulo cuarenta y cuatro de Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a, de Bernal Diaz del Castillo. Captura y dise\u00f1o, Chantal Lopez y Omar Cortes para la Biblioteca Virtual Antorcha|website=www.antorcha.net}}</ref> Cort\u00e9s named one of Cacamatzin's brothers as new tlatoani. He was [[Ixtlilx\u00f3chitl II]], who had disagreed with his brother and always proved friendly to the Spanish. Later, Cort\u00e9s also occupied the city as base for the construction of brigantines. However, one faction of Tetzcocan warriors remained loyal to the Aztecs.<ref name=\"enlace externo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.edomexico.gob.mx/identidad/civica/html/conquista.html|title=Identidad Mexiquense|date=9 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209233616/http://www.edomexico.gob.mx/identidad/civica/html/conquista.html|archive-date=2007-02-09}}</ref>\n\nCort\u00e9s had to put down internal struggles among the Spanish troops as well. The remaining Spanish soldiers were somewhat divided; many wanted nothing more than to go home, or at the very least to return to Vera Cruz and wait for reinforcements. Cort\u00e9s hurriedly quashed this faction, determined to finish what he had started. Not only had he staked everything he had or could borrow on this enterprise, he had completely compromised himself by defying his superior [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar|Vel\u00e1zquez]]. He knew that in defeat he would be considered a traitor to Spain, but that in success he would be its hero. So he argued, cajoled, bullied and coerced his troops, and they began preparing for the siege of Mexico. In this Cort\u00e9s showed skill at exploiting the divisions within and between the Aztec states while hiding those of his own troops.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\n===Smallpox reduces the local population===\nWhile Cort\u00e9s was rebuilding his alliances and garnering more supplies, a [[smallpox]] epidemic struck the natives of the Valley of Mexico, including Tenochtitlan. The disease was probably carried by a Spanish slave from Narv\u00e1ez's forces, who had been abandoned in the capital during the Spanish flight.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/> Smallpox played a crucial role in the Spanish success during the Siege of Tenochtitlan from 1519\u20131521, a fact not mentioned in some historical accounts. The disease broke out in Tenochtitlan in late October 1520. The epidemic lasted sixty days, ending by early December.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Le\u00f3n, Portilla Miguel. 2006 The Broken Spears: the Aztec Account of the Conquest of Mexico. Boston: Beacon</ref>\n\nIt was at this event where firsthand accounts were recorded in the Florentine Codex concerning the adverse effects of the smallpox epidemic of the Aztecs, which stated, \"many died from this plague, and many others died of hunger. They could not get up and search for food, and everyone else was too sick to care for them, so they starved to death in their beds. By the time the danger was recognized, the plague was well established that nothing could halt it\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The smallpox epidemic caused not only infection to the Mexica peoples, but it weakened able bodied people who could no longer grow and harvest their crops, which in turn led to mass famine and death from malnutrition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> While the population of Tenochtitlan was recovering, the disease continued to Chalco, a city on the southeast corner of Lake Texcoco that was formerly controlled by the Aztecs but now occupied by the Spanish.<ref name=\"Sahagun\"/>\n\nReproduction and population growth declined since people of child-bearing age either had to fight off the Spanish invasion or died due to famine, malnutrition or other diseases.<ref>(Leon-Portilla 1962: 117, Le\u00f3n, Portilla Miguel. 2006 The Broken Spears: the Aztec Account of the Conquest of Mexico. Boston: Beacon</ref> Diseases like smallpox could travel great distances and spread throughout large populations, which was the case with the Aztecs having lost approximately 50% of its population from smallpox and other diseases.<ref>(Diamond 1999: 210), Diamond, Jared M. 1999 Guns, Germs, and Steel: the Fates of Human Societies. New York: Norton.</ref> The disease killed an estimated forty percent of the native population in the area within a year. The Aztecs codices give ample depictions of the disease's progression. It was known to them as the ''huey ahuizotl'' (great rash).{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nCuitlahuac contracted the disease and died after ruling for eighty days. Though the disease also affected the Spanish-aligned forces somewhat, it had more dire consequences for the leadership on the side of the Aztecs, as they were much harder hit by the smallpox than the Spanish leaders, who were largely resistant to the disease.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Aztecs regroup===\nIt is often debated why the Aztecs took little action against the Spanish and their allies after they fled the city. One reason was that Tenochtitlan was certainly in a state of disorder: the smallpox disease ravaged the population, killing still more important leaders and nobles, and a new king, [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]], son of King [[Ahuitzotl]], was placed on the throne in February 1521. The people were in the process of mourning the dead and rebuilding their damaged city. It is possible that the Aztecs truly believed that the Spanish were gone for good. In addition, Cort\u00e9s astutely directed his forces in multiple directions in preparing his encirclement of the Aztec capital, and knew how to use the military initiative that he gained after the battle of Otumba.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\nStaying within Tenochtitlan as a defensive tactic may have seemed like a reliable strategy at the time. This would allow them the largest possible army that would be close to its supplies, while affording them the mobility provided by the surrounding lake. Any Spanish assault would have to come through the causeways, where the Aztecs could easily attack them. As the only Aztec victory against the Spanish was won in the city using their peculiar urban warfare tactics, and as they counted on retaining control over the water, it seems natural that they wanted to risk their main army only to defend their capital. However, it would not be correct to infer that the Aztecs were passive observers of their fate - they did send numerous expeditions to aid their allies against Cort\u00e9s at every point, with 10 to 20 thousand forces risked in every engagement, such as in Chalco and Chapultepec. They were driven back every time, and some of the native allies won their own victories over the Aztecs, as their dread of their invincible overlords faded with every success of Cort\u00e9s.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\n==Siege of Tenochtitlan==\n\n===Cort\u00e9s plans and prepares===\nCort\u00e9s's overall plan was to trap and besiege the Aztecs within their capital. Cort\u00e9s intended to do that primarily by increasing his power and mobility on the lake, while protecting \"his flanks while they marched up the causeway\", previously one of his main weaknesses. He ordered the construction of thirteen [[sloop]]s (brigantines) in Tlaxcala, by his master shipbuilder, Mart\u00edn L\u00f3pez. Cort\u00e9s continued to receive a steady stream of supplies from ships arriving at Vera Cruz, one ship from Spain loaded with \"arms and powder\", and two ships intended for Narv\u00e1ez. Cort\u00e9s also received one hundred and fifty soldiers and twenty horses from the abandoned [[Panuco river]] settlement. A large source of succour for Cort\u00e9s were the misguided expeditions by Francisco de Garay, the Governor of Jamaica, who kept sending ship after ship to aid his original Panuco venture long after it had been destroyed and abandoned; all of these ships and forces ended up reinforcing Cort\u00e9s before the siege.<ref name=Diaz>Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}</ref>{{rp|309, 311, 324}}\n\nCort\u00e9s then decided to move his army to Texcoco, where he could assemble and launch the sloops in the creeks flowing into Lake Texcoco. With his main headquarters in Texcoco, he could stop his forces from being spread too thin around the lake, and there he could contact them where they needed. [[Xicotencatl the Elder]] provided Cort\u00e9s with over ten thousand Tlaxcalan warriors under the command of Chichimecatecle. Cort\u00e9s departed Tlaxcala on the day after Christmas 1520. When his force arrived at the outskirts of Texcoco, he was met by seven chieftains stating their leader [[Coanacoch|Coanacotzin]] begs \"for your friendship\". Cort\u00e9s quickly replaced that leader with the son of [[Nezahualpilli]], baptized as Don Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|311\u201316}}\n\nAfter winning over [[Chalco (alt\u00e9petl)|Chalco]] and [[Tlamanalco]], Cort\u00e9s sent eight Mexican prisoners to [[Cuauhtemoc]] stating, \"all the towns in the neighborhood were now on our side, as well as the Tlaxcalans\". Cort\u00e9s intended to blockade Mexico and then destroy it. Once Martin L\u00f3pez and Chichimecatecle brought the logs and planks to Texcoco, the sloops were built quickly.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|321\u201325}} Cuauhtemoc's forces were defeated four times in March 1521, around Chalco and [[Huaxtepec]], and Cort\u00e9s received another ship load of arms and men from the Emperor.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|326\u201332}}\n\nOn 6 April 1521, Cort\u00e9s met with the ''[[caciques]]'' around Chalco, and announced he would \"bring peace\" and blockade Mexico. He wanted all of their warriors ready the next day when he put thirteen sloops into the lake (misleadingly called \"launches\" in some translations). He was then joined at Chimaluacan by twenty thousand warriors from Chalco, Texcoco, Huejotzingo, and Tlaxcala.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|333}} Cort\u00e9s fought a major engagement with seventeen thousand of Cuauhtemoc's warriors at [[Xochimilco]], before continuing his march northwestward.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|340\u201347}} Cort\u00e9s found Coyoacan, Tacuba, Atzcapotzalco, and Cuauhitlan deserted.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|347\u201349}}\n\nReturning to Texcoco, which had been guarded by his Captain Gonzalo de Sandoval, Cort\u00e9s was joined by many more men from Castile.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|349}} Cort\u00e9s then discovered a plot aimed at his murder, for which he had the main conspirator, Antonio de Villafana, hanged. Thereafter, Cort\u00e9s had a personal guard of six soldiers, under the command of Antonio de Qui\u00f1ones.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|350\u201351}} The Spaniards also held their third auctioning of branded slaves, Mexican allies captured by Cort\u00e9s, \"who had revolted after giving their obedience to His Majesty.\"<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|308, 352}}\n\nCort\u00e9s had 84 horsemen, 194 [[arbalest]]ers and [[arquebus]]iers, plus 650 Spanish foot soldiers. He stationed 25 men on every sloop, 12 oarsmen, 12 crossbowmen and musketeers, and a captain. Each sloop had rigging, sails, oars, and spare oars. Additionally, Cort\u00e9s had 20,000 warriors from Tlaxcala, Huexotzinco, and Cholula. The Tlaxcalans were led by [[Xicotencatl II]] and Chichimecatecle. Cort\u00e9s was ready to start the blockade of Mexico after [[Corpus Christi (feast)]].<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|353\u201354}}\n\nCort\u00e9s put Alvarado in command of 30 horsemen, 18 arbalesters and arquebusiers, 150 Spanish foot soldiers, and 8,000 Tlaxcalan allies, and sent him, accompanied by his brother [[Jorge de Alvarado]], Gutierrez de Badajoz, and Andr\u00e9s de Monjaraz, to secure Tacuba. [[Crist\u00f3bal de Olid]] took 30 horsemen, 20 arbalesters and arquebusiers, 175 foot soldiers, and 8,000 Tlaxcalan allies, accompanied by Andr\u00e9s de Tapia, Francisco Verdugo, and [[Francisco de Lugo]], and secured Coyohuacan. [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]] took 24 horsemen, 14 arquebusiers and arbalesters, 150 Spanish foot soldiers, and 8,000 warriors from Chalco and Huexotzinco, accompanied by Luis Marin and Pedro de Ircio, to secure Ixtlapalapan. Cort\u00e9s commanded the 13 sloops.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|356}} Cort\u00e9s' forces took up these positions on May 22.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\n===The first battles===\n[[File:Battle Spanish Otomies Metztitlan.jpg|thumb|300px|An encounter between Spanish and Aztec combatants as depicted in the ''[[History of Tlaxcala]]''.]]\nThe forces under Alvarado and Olid marched first towards [[Chapultepec]] to disconnect the Aztecs from their water supply.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|359}} There were springs there that supplied much of the city's water by aqueduct; the rest of the city's water was brought in by canoe. The two generals then tried to bring their forces over the causeway at [[Tlacopan]], resulting in the '''Battle of Tlacopan'''.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/> The Aztec forces managed to push back the Spanish and halt this assault on the capital with a determined and hard-fought land and naval counterattack.<ref name=\"spears\"/>{{rp|94}}<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|359\u201360}}\n\nCort\u00e9s faced \"more than a thousand canoes\" after he launched his thirteen sloops from Texcoco. Yet a \"favorable breeze sprang up\", enabling him to overturn many canoes and kill or capture many. After winning the '''First Battle on the Lake''', Cort\u00e9s camped with Olid's forces.<ref name=\"spears\"/>{{rp|94}}<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|362}}\n\nThe Aztec canoe fleets worked well for attacking the Spanish because they allowed the Aztecs to surround the Spanish on both sides of the causeway. Cort\u00e9s decided to make an opening in the causeway so that his brigantines could help defend his forces from both sides. He then distributed the sloops amongst his attacking forces, four to Alvarado, six for Olid, and two to Sandoval on the Tepeaquilla causeway. After this move, the Aztecs could no longer attack from their canoes on the opposite side of the Spanish brigantines, and \"the fighting went very much in our favour\", according to D\u00edaz.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|363}}\n\nWith his brigantines, Cort\u00e9s could also send forces and supplies to areas he previously could not, which put a kink in Cuauht\u00e9moc's plan. To make it more difficult for the Spanish ships to aid the Spanish soldier's advance along the causeways, the Aztecs dug deep pits in shallow areas of the lakes, into which they hoped the Spaniards would stumble, and fixed concealed stakes into the lake bottom to impale the launches. The Spanish horses were also ineffective on the causeways.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|364}}\n\nCort\u00e9s was forced to adapt his plans again, as his initial land campaigns were ineffective. He had planned to attack on the causeways during the daytime and retreat to camp at night; however, the Aztecs moved in to occupy the abandoned bridges and barricades as soon as the Spanish forces left. Consequently, Cort\u00e9s had his forces set up on the causeways at night to defend their positions.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|364\u201366}} Cort\u00e9s also sent orders to \"never on any account to leave a gap unblocked, and that all the horsemen were to sleep on the causeway with their horses saddled and bridled all night long.\"<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|372}} This allowed the Spanish to progress closer and closer towards the city.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\nThe Spaniards prevented food and water from reaching Tenochtitlan along the three causeways. They limited the supplies reaching the city from the nine surrounding towns via canoe, by sending out two of their launches on nightly capture missions. However, the Aztecs were successful in setting an ambush with thirty of their [[pirogue]]s in an area in which they had placed impaling stakes. They captured two Spanish launches, killing Captain de Portilla and Pedro Barba.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|368\u201369, 382\u201383}}\n\n===The Spanish advance closer===\n[[File:Museo_de_Am\u00e9rica_Conquest_of_Mexico_04.jpg|thumb|right|250px|During the siege of Tenochtitlan, Hernan Cort\u00e9s narrowly escaped capture by Aztec warriors.

Cort\u00e9s then organized a counter-ambush with six of his launches, which was successful, \"killing many warriors and taking many prisoners.\" Afterwards, the Aztec \"did not dare to lay any more ambuscades, or to bring in food and water as openly as before.\" Lakeside towns, including Iztapalapa, Churubusco, Culuacan, and Mixquic made peace with the Spaniards.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|374\u201375}} The fighting in Tenochtitlan was described by the American historian Charles Robinson as \"desperate\" as both sides battled one another in the streets in a ferocious battle where no quarter was given nor asked for.<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 58\">Robinson, Charles ''The Spanish Invasion of Mexico 1519\u20131521'', London: Osprey, 2004 p. 58.</ref>\n\nCuauhtemoc then attacked all three Spanish camps simultaneously with his entire army on the feast day of St. John. On the Tacuba Causeway across Lake Texcoco connecting Tenochtitlan to the mainland along a street now known as ''Puente de Alvarado'' (Alvarado's Bridge) in Mexico City, Pedro de Alvarado made a mad cavalry charge across a gap in the Causeway.<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 58\"/> As Alvarado and his cavalry emerged on the other side of the gap with the infantry behind, Aztec canoes filled the gap.<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 58\"/> Pedro de Alvarado was wounded along with eight men in his camp.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|377}} Alvarado escaped from the ambush, but five of his men were captured and taken off to the Great Temple to be sacrificed.<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 58\"/> Much to their horror, the Spanish from their positions could see their captured comrades being sacrificed on the Great Pyramid, which increased their hatred of the Aztecs.<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 59\">Robinson, Charles ''The Spanish Invasion of Mexico 1519\u20131521'', London: Osprey, 2004 p. 59.</ref> At the end of each day, the Spanish gave a prayer: \"Oh, thanks be to God that they did not carry me off today to be sacrificed.\"<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 59\"/>\n\nCort\u00e9s then decided to push forward a simultaneous attack towards the Mexican market square. However, he neglected to fill in a channel as he advanced, and when the Aztec counter-attacked, Cort\u00e9s was wounded and almost captured. Crist\u00f3bal de Olea and Crist\u00f3bal de Guzm\u00e1n gave their lives for Cort\u00e9s, and sixty-five Spanish soldiers were captured alive. Cuauhtemoc then had five of their heads thrown at Alvarado's camp, four thrown at Cort\u00e9s' camp, six thrown at Sandoval's camp, while ten more were sacrificed to the Huitzilopochtli and Texcatlipoca idols.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|379\u201383}}\n\nD\u00edaz relates, \"...the dismal drum of Huichilobos sounded again,...we saw our comrades who had been captured in Cort\u00e9s' defeat being dragged up the steps to be sacrificed...cutting open their chests, drew out their palpitating hearts which they offered to the idols...the Indian butchers...cut off their arms and legs...then they ate their flesh with a sauce of peppers and tomatoes...throwing their trunks and entrails to the lions and tigers and serpents and snakes.\" Cuauhtemoc then \"sent the hands and feet of our soldiers, and the skin of their faces...to all the towns of our allies...\" The Aztec sacrificed a batch of Spanish prisoners each night for ten nights.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|386\u201387, 391}} The Aztec cast off the cooked limbs of their prisoners to the Tlaxcalans, shouting: \"Eat the flesh of these ''teules'' [\"Gods\"-a reference to the early belief that Spanish were gods] and of your brothers because we are sated with it\".<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 59\"/>\n\nThe Aztec continued to attack the Spaniards on the causeways, \"day and night\". The Spanish allies in the cities surrounding the lake lost many lives or \"went home wounded\", and \"half their canoes were destroyed\". Yet, \"they did not help the Aztec any more, for they loathed them.\" Yet, of the 24,000 allies, only 200 remained in the three Spanish camps, the rest deciding to return home.\nAhuaxpitzactzin (later baptized as Don Carlos), the brother of the Texcoco lord Don Fernando, remained in Cort\u00e9s' camp with forty relatives and friends. The Huejotzinco Cacique remained in Sandoval's camp with fifty men. Alvarado's camp had Chichimecatecle, the two sons of Lorenzo de Vargas, and eighty Tlaxcalans.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|388\u201389}} To maintain the advance, Cort\u00e9s razed every neighborhood he captured, using the rubble to fill up canals and gaps in the causeways to allow his infantry and cavalry to advance in formation, a fighting tactic that favored the Spanish instead of engaging in hand to hand street fighting, which favored the Aztec.<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 59\"/>\n\nCort\u00e9s then concentrated on letting the Aztec \"eat up all the provisions they have\" and drink brackish water. The Spaniards gradually advanced along the causeways, though without allies. Their launches had freedom of the lake, after devising a method for breaking the impaling stakes the Aztec had placed for them. After twelve days of this, the Spanish allies realized the prophecy by the Aztec idols, that the Spaniards would be dead in ten days was false. Two thousand warriors returned from Texcoco, as did many Tlaxcan warriors under Tepaneca from Topeyanco, and those from Huejotzingo and Cholula.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|390\u201391}}\nCuauhtemoc then enlisted his allies in Matlazingo, Malinalco, and Tulapa, in attacking the Spaniards from the rear. However, Cort\u00e9s sent Andr\u00e9s de Tapia, with 20 horsemen and 100 soldiers, and Gonzalo de Sandoval, with 20 horsemen and 80 soldiers, to help his allies attack this new threat. They returned with two of the Matlazingo chieftains as prisoners.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|396}}\n\nAs the Spanish employed more successful strategies, their stranglehold on Tenochtitlan tightened, and famine began to affect the Aztecs. The Aztecs were cut off from the mainland because of the occupied causeways. Cort\u00e9s also had the advantage of fighting a mostly defensive battle. Though Cuauht\u00e9moc organized a large-scale attack on Alvarado's forces at Tlacopan, the Aztec forces were pushed back. Throughout the siege, the Aztecs had little aid from outside of Tenochtitlan. The remaining loyal tributaries had difficulty sending forces, because it would leave them vulnerable to Spanish attack. Many of these loyal tributaries were surrounded by the Spanish.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThough the tributaries often went back and forth in their loyalties at any sign of change, the Spanish tried hard not to lose any allies. They feared a \"snowball effect\": if one tributary left, others might follow. Therefore, they brutally crushed any tributaries who tried to send help to Tenochtitlan. Any shipments of food and water were intercepted, and even those trying to fish in the lake were attacked.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/> The situation inside the city was desperate: because of the famine and the smallpox there were already thousands of victims, women offered to the gods even their children's clothes, so most children were stark naked. Many Aztecs drank dirty, brackish water because of their severe thirst and contracted dysentery. The famine was so severe that the Aztecs ate anything, even wood, leather, and bricks for sustenance.<ref name=\"Sahagun\"/>\n\nThe Spanish continued to push closer to Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs changed tactics as often as the Spanish did, preventing Cort\u00e9s's forces from being entirely victorious. However, the Aztecs were severely worn down. They had no new troops, supplies, food, nor water. The Spanish received a large amount of supplies from Vera Cruz, and, somewhat renewed, finally entered the main part of Tenochtitlan.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/><ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|396}}\n\n===The Aztecs' last stand===\nCort\u00e9s then ordered a simultaneous advance of all three camps towards the Tlatelolco marketplace. Alvarado's company made it there first, and Gutierrez de Badajoz advanced to the top of the Huichilopotzli ''cu'', setting it afire and planting their Spanish banners. Cort\u00e9s' and Sandoval's men were able to join them there after four more days of fighting.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|396\u201398}}\n\nThe Spanish forces and their allies advanced into the city. Despite inflicting heavy casualties, the Aztecs could not halt the Spanish advance. While the fighting in the city raged, the Aztecs cut out and ate the hearts of 70 Spanish prisoners-of-war at the altar to Huitzilopochtli. By August, many of the native inhabitants had fled [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]].<ref name=\"spears\"/> Cort\u00e9s sent emissaries to negotiate with the Tlatelolcas to join his side, but the Tlatelolcas remained loyal to the Aztecs. Throughout the siege, the Tlaxcalans waged a merciless campaign against the Aztecs who had long oppressed them as for a hundred years the Tlaxcalans had been forced to hand over an annual quota of young men and women to be sacrificed and eaten at the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan, and now the Tlaxcalans saw their chance for revenge.<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 60\">Robinson, Charles ''The Spanish Invasion of Mexico 1519\u20131521'', London: Osprey, 2004 p. 60.</ref> The American historian Charles Robinson wrote: \"Centuries of hate and the basic viciousness of Mesoamerican warfare combined in violence that appalled Cort\u00e9s himself\".<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 60\"/> In letter to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Cort\u00e9s wrote: <blockquote>\"We had more trouble in preventing our allies from killing with such cruelty than we had in fighting the enemy. For no race, however savage, has ever practiced such fierce and unnatural cruelty as the natives of these parts. Our allies also took many spoils that day, which we were unable to prevent, as they numbered more than 150,000 and we Spaniards only some nine hundred. Neither our precautions nor our warnings could stop their looting, though we did all we could...I had posted Spaniards in every street, so that when the people began to come out [to surrender] they might prevent our allies from killing those wretched people, whose numbers was uncountable. I also told the captains of our allies that on no account should any of those people be slain; but there were so many that we could not prevent more than fifteen thousand being killed and sacrificed [by the Tlaxcalans] that day\".<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 60\"/></blockquote>\n\nThroughout the battles with the Spanish, the Aztecs still practiced the traditional ceremonies and customs. Tlapaltecatl Opochtzin was chosen to be outfitted to wear the quetzal owl costume. He was supplied with darts sacred to Huitzilopochtli, which came with wooden tips and flint tops. When he came, the Spanish soldiers appeared scared and intimidated. They chased the owl-warrior, but he was neither captured nor killed. The Aztecs took this as a good sign, but they could fight no more, and after discussions with the nobles, Cuauht\u00e9moc began talks with the Spanish.<ref name=\"Sahagun\"/>\n\nAfter several failed peace overtures to Cuauht\u00e9moc, Cort\u00e9s ordered Sandoval to attack that part of the city in which Cuauht\u00e9moc had retreated. As hundreds of canoes filled the lake fleeing the doomed city, Cort\u00e9s sent his brigantines out to intercept them.<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 60\"/> Cuauht\u00e9moc attempted to flee with his property, gold, jewels, and family in fifty pirogues, but was soon captured by Sandoval's launches, and brought before Cort\u00e9s.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|401\u201303}}\n\n==The surrender==\n[[File:El suplicio de Cuauht\u00e9moc.jpg|thumb|300px|right|\"The Torture of [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]]\", a 19th-century painting by [[Leandro Izaguirre]]]]\nThe Aztec forces were destroyed and the Aztecs surrendered on 13 August 1521, Julian Date.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|404}} Cort\u00e9s demanded the return of the gold lost during [[La Noche Triste]]. Under torture, by burning their feet with oil, Cuauht\u00e9moc and the lord of Tacuba, confessed to dumping his gold and jewels into the lake. Yet, little gold remained, as earlier, a fifth had been sent to Spain and another kept by Cort\u00e9s. \"In the end...the remaining gold all fell to the King's officials.\"<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|409\u201310, 412}}\n\n[[Cuauht\u00e9moc]] was taken prisoner the same day, as related above, and remained the titular leader of Tenochtitlan, under the control of Cort\u00e9s, until he was hanged for treason in 1525 while accompanying a Spanish expedition to Guatemala.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Casualties and atrocities===\n[[File:LastDaysofTenochtitlanB.jpg|thumb|250px|left|\"The Last Days of [[Tenochtitlan]], [[Conquest of Mexico]] by Cortez\", a 19th-century painting by [[William de Leftwich Dodge]].]]\n\n100,000<ref name=grosshumanrights/> to 240,000<ref name=twofor/><ref name=toofor/> were killed in the campaign overall including warriors and civilians.

Ultimately, Spain conquered Mexico and thereby gained substantial access to the [[Pacific Ocean]], which meant that the [[Spanish Empire]] could finally achieve its original oceanic goal of reaching the Asian markets.\n\n==Early events==\n{{Main|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}\n\n===The road to Tenochtitlan===\nIn April 1519 [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], an ambitious nobleman recently landed in Cuba, and the leader of the third Spanish expedition to the coast of Mexico, landed as directed by the survivors of the previous two expeditions at [[San Juan de Ul\u00faa]], a good harbour on Mexico's east coast, with 508 soldiers, 100 sailors, and 14 small cannons. [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar|Governor Vel\u00e1zquez]], the Governor of Cuba, called for Cort\u00e9s to lead an expedition into Mexico after favourable reports from two previous expeditions to Yucat\u00e1n caught the interest of the Spanish in Cuba.<ref name=\"PBS\">[https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_flat.html Conquistadors, with Michael Wood]&nbsp;\u2013 website for 2001 PBS documentary</ref> Under the pressure of his relatives who had a different leader in mind, Vel\u00e1zquez regretted his decision and revoked Cort\u00e9s' mandate to lead the expedition even before Cort\u00e9s left Cuba. Thus Cort\u00e9s had to fight for his survival as a leader while still in Cuba; twice the messengers of Vel\u00e1squez arrived to depose him, and twice they were spoken to with honeyed words and dissuaded from executing their mission. After Cort\u00e9s sailed, Vel\u00e1zquez sent an army led by [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] to take him into custody.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nBut Cort\u00e9s used the same legal tactic used by Governor Vel\u00e1zquez when he invaded Cuba years before: he created a local government and had himself elected as the magistrate, thus (in theory) making him responsible only to the King of Spain. Cort\u00e9s followed this tactic when he and his men established the city of ''Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz'', also known as [[Veracruz]], seven miles from the harbour of San Juan de Ulua. An inquiry into Cort\u00e9s' action was conducted in Spain in 1529 and no action was taken against him.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nCort\u00e9s chanced to land at the borders of Cempoala, a recently Aztec-subdued vassal state with many grievances against them. Coming into contact with a number of polities who resented Aztec rule, Cort\u00e9s claimed he has arrived on the orders of his Emperor to put things in order, abolish human sacrifices, teach the locals the true faith and \"stop them from robbing each other\", and was successful in enforcing excellent behaviour of his army when among potential allies. Cort\u00e9s clashed with some of these polities, among them the [[Totonac people|Totonacs]] and [[Tlaxcaltec|Tlaxcalans]]. The latter gave him two good day battles and one night battle, and kept up a strong defense, holding off his army on a hilltop for two weeks. His numerically inferior force finally triumphed when the minds of Tlaxcalans opened up to consideration of his ceaseless offers of peace, notably [[Xicotencatl the Elder]] and his wish to form an alliance with the Spaniards against the Aztecs which was the proffered aim of Cort\u00e9s as well.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIt once was widely believed that the Aztecs first thought Cort\u00e9s was [[Quetzalcoatl]], a mythical god prophesied to return to Mexico\u2014coincidentally in the same year Cort\u00e9s landed and from the same direction he came. This is now believed{{when|date=August 2015}} to be an invention of the conquerors, and perhaps natives who wished to rationalize the actions of the Aztec ''[[tlatoani]]'', [[Moctezuma II]]. Most scholars{{Who|date=August 2015}} agree that the Aztecs, especially the inner circle around Moctezuma, were well convinced that Cort\u00e9s was not a god in any shape or form.<ref>\"The Mexico Reader: History, Culture, Politics\". Joseph, Gilbert M. and Henderson, Timothy J. Duke University Press, 2002.{{page needed|date=November 2010}}</ref> Messages between Cort\u00e9s and Moctezuma, however, frequently allude to the legend, which was widely known across the Aztec dominions to both Aztecs and their subjects, and strongly influenced them, as Bernal Diaz del Castillo repeatedly mentions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nMoctezuma sent a group of noblemen and other emissaries to meet Cort\u00e9s at Quauhtechcac.

As news about the strangers reached the capital city, Moctezuma became increasingly fearful and considered fleeing the city but resigned himself to what he considered to be the fate of his people.<ref name=\"Le\u00f3n Portilla\">\"Visi\u00f3n de los vencidos.\" Le\u00f3n-Portilla, Miguel (Ed.)

Before entering the city, on November 8, 1519, Cort\u00e9s and his troops prepared themselves for battle, armoring themselves and their horses, and arranging themselves in proper military rank. Four horsemen were at the lead of the procession. Behind these horsemen were five more contingents: foot soldiers with iron swords and wooden or leather shields; horsemen in cuirasses, armed with iron lances, swords, and wooden shields; crossbowmen; more horsemen; soldiers armed with [[arquebus]]es; lastly, native peoples from Tlaxcalan, Tliliuhquitepec, and Huexotzinco. The indigenous soldiers wore cotton armor and were armed with shields and crossbows; many carried provisions in baskets or bundles while others escorted the cannons on wooden carts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nCort\u00e9s' army entered the city on the flower-covered causeway from [[Iztapalapa]], associated with the god Quetzalcoatl. Cort\u00e9s was amicably received by Moctezuma. The captive woman Malinalli Ten\u00e9pal, also known as [[Do\u00f1a Marina]], translated from Nahuatl to [[Chontal Maya language|Chontal Maya]]; the Spaniard [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Aguilar]] translated from Chontal Maya to Spanish.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nMoctezuma was soon taken hostage on November 14, 1519, as a safety measure by the vastly outnumbered Spanish. Another reason for his sudden capture was news that Moctezuma received from one of his messengers. It was reported to Moctezuma that at least eight hundred more Spaniards in thirteen great ships had arrived on the coast. Moctezuma received this information a few days before Cort\u00e9s did. Cort\u00e9s had been communicating to the crown that he had the entire situation under control and was practically running the city of Tenochtitlan. With the vast new Spanish ships forces on the horizon, sent by his enemy Diego Velasquez, they could only revoke his commission and recall him, thus ending his campaign in Mexico and probably dooming the Spanish attempt for a lightning conquest, as no other Spanish leader could wield authority as effectively both among the natives and the Spaniards. Therefore, Cort\u00e9s made the decision to abruptly abduct the King; only with a knife to his throat could Cort\u00e9s ensure his cooperation.<ref>\"Malintzin's Choices\" Camilla Townsend University of New Mexico Press, 2006</ref> According to all eyewitness accounts, Moctezuma initially refused to leave his palace but after a series of threats from and debates with the Spanish captains, and assurances from Do\u00f1a Marina, he agreed to move to the Axay\u00e1ctal palace with his retinue. The first captain assigned to guard him was [[Pedro de Alvarado]]. Other Aztec lords were also detained by the Spanish, when they started questioning their captive King's authority.<ref name=\"Sahagun\"/> The palace was surrounded by over 100 Spanish soldiers in order to prevent any attempt at rescue.<ref name=\"Cervantes Salazar\">Cervantes de Salazar, Francisco. \"Cr\u00f3nica de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a. Madrid: Linkgua Ediciones, 2007.{{page needed|date=November 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Tensions mount between Aztecs and Spaniards===\nIt is uncertain why Moctezuma cooperated so readily with the Spaniards. It is possible he feared losing his life or political power; however, one of the effective threats wielded by Cort\u00e9s was the destruction of his beautiful city in the case of fighting between Spaniards and Aztecs (which ultimately came to pass). This Moctezuma at all costs wanted to avoid, vacillating and deferring the rupture until this policy claimed his life. It was clear from the beginning that he was ambivalent about who Cort\u00e9s and his men really were, whether they be gods, descendants of a god, ambassadors from a greater king, or just barbaric invaders. From the perspective of the tlatoani, the Spaniards might have been assigned some decisive role by fate. It could also have been a tactical move: Moctezuma may have wanted to gather more information on the Spaniards, or to wait for the end of the agricultural season and strike at the beginning of the war season.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} However, he did not carry out either of these actions even though high-ranking military leaders such as his brother [[Cuitlahuac]] and nephew [[Cacamatzin]] urged him to do so.<ref name=\"Hassig\">Hassig, Ross.  ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest''.  New York: Longman, 1994.{{page needed|date=November 2010}}</ref>\n\nWith Moctezuma captive, Cort\u00e9s did not need to worry about being cut off from supplies or being attacked, although some of his captains had such concerns. He also assumed that he could control the Aztecs through Moctezuma. However, Cort\u00e9s had little knowledge of the ruling system of the Aztecs; Moctezuma was not all-powerful as Cort\u00e9s imagined. Being appointed to and maintaining the position of tlatoani was based on the ability to rule decisively; he could be replaced by another noble if he failed to do so. At any sign of weakness, Aztec nobles within Tenochtitlan and in other Aztec tributaries were liable to rebel. As Moctezuma complied with orders issued by Cort\u00e9s, such as commanding tribute to be gathered and given to the Spaniards, his authority was slipping, and quickly his people began to turn against him.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\nCort\u00e9s and his army were permitted to stay in the Palace of Axayacatl, and tensions continued to grow. While the Spaniards were in Tenochtitlan, Vel\u00e1zquez assembled a force of nineteen ships, more than 1400 soldiers with twenty cannons, eighty horsemen, one-hundred and twenty crossbowmen, and eighty arquebusiers under the command of [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] to capture Cort\u00e9s and return him to Cuba. Vel\u00e1zquez felt that Cort\u00e9s had exceeded his authority, and had been aware of Cort\u00e9s's misconduct for nearly a year. He had to wait for favorable winds, though, and was unable to send any forces until spring. Narv\u00e1ez's troops landed at San Juan de Ul\u00faa on the Mexican coast around April 20, 1520.<ref>Hassig (2006, p. 107).</ref>\n\nAfter Cort\u00e9s became aware of their arrival, he left Pedro de Alvarado in charge in Tenochtitlan with 80 soldiers, and brought all his forces (about two hundred and forty men) by quick marches to Narv\u00e1ez's camp in Cempohuallan on May 27. Several negotiations between the two Spaniards took place on the way, in which Cort\u00e9s was able to persuade many persons of weight in Narv\u00e1ez's camp to incline to his side. Cort\u00e9s attacked Narv\u00e1ez's camp late at night; his men, much superior in experience and organization, wounded Narv\u00e1ez in the eye and took him as a hostage quickly; also taken were his principal adherents, de Salvatierra and Diego Velasquez (the nephew of the Governor of Cuba). Evidence suggests that the two were in the midst of negotiations at the time, and Narv\u00e1ez was not expecting an attack. Cort\u00e9s then completed winning over Narv\u00e1ez's captains with promises of the vast wealth in Tenochtitlan, inducing them to follow him back to the Aztec capital. Narv\u00e1ez was imprisoned in Vera Cruz, and his army was integrated into Cort\u00e9s's forces.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\n==Rapid deterioration of relations==\n\n===Massacre at the festival of T\u00f3xcatl===\n{{Main|Massacre in the Great Temple}}\n[[File:Alvarado.jpeg|thumb|200px|Conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]].]]\nDuring Cort\u00e9s's absence, [[Pedro de Alvarado]] was left in command in Tenochtitlan with 80 soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAt this time, the Aztecs began to prepare for the annual festival of [[Toxcatl]] in early May, in honor of [[Tezcatlipoca]], otherwise known as the Smoking Mirror or the Omnipotent Power. They honored this god during the onset of the dry season so that the god would fill dry streambeds and cause rain to fall on crops. Moctezuma secured the consent of Cort\u00e9s to hold the festival, and again confirmed permission with Alvarado.<ref name=\"Levy, Buddy 2008\">Levy, Buddy, Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stands of the Aztecs, (New York: Bantam Books, 2008), 163\u201364.</ref>\n\nAlvarado agreed to allow the festival on the condition that there would be no human sacrifice, but the Toxcatl festival had featured human sacrifice as the main part of its climactic rituals. The sacrifice involved the killing of a young man who had been impersonating the Toxcatl deity for a full year. Thus, prohibiting human sacrifice during this festival was an untenable proposition for the Aztecs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nBefore the festival, Alvarado encountered a group of women building a statue of [[Huitzilopochtli]] and the image unsettled him, and he became suspicious about the eventuality of human sacrifice. He tortured priests and nobles and discovered that the Aztecs were planning a revolt. Unable to assert control over events, he sequestered Moctezuma and increased the guards around the tlatoani.<ref>Levy, Buddy, Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stands of the Aztecs, (New York: Bantam Books, 2008), 166.</ref>\n\nBy the day of the festival, the Aztecs had gathered on the Patio of Dances. Alvarado had sixty of his men as well as many of his Tlaxcalan allies into positions around the patio. The Aztecs initiated the Serpent Dance. The euphoric dancing as well as the accompanying flute and drum playing disturbed Alvarado about the potential for revolt. He ordered the gates closed and initiated the killing of many thousands of Aztec nobles, warriors and priests.<ref>Levy, Buddy, Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stands of the Aztecs, (New York: Bantam Books, 2008), 168\u201370.</ref>\n\nAlvarado, the conquistadors and the Tlaxcalans retreated to their base in the Palace of Axayacatl and secured the entrances. Alvarado ordered his men to shoot their cannons, crossbows and arquebuses into the gathering crowd. The result either preempted or triggered the Aztec revolt, which was, however, inevitable from the moment of Moctezuma's capture and was accelerated by the split of the Spanish forces. Alvarado forced Moctezuma to appeal to the crowd outside the Palace and this appeal temporarily calmed them.<ref>Levy, Buddy, Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stands of the Aztecs, (New York: Bantam Books, 2008), 170\u201371.</ref>\n\nThe massacre had the result of resolutely turning all the Aztecs against the Spanish and completely undermining Moctezuma's authority.<ref>Levy, Buddy, Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stands of the Aztecs, (New York: Bantam Books, 2008), 171.</ref>\n\n===Aztec revolt===\nAlvarado sent word to Cort\u00e9s of the events, and Cort\u00e9s hurried back to Tenochtitlan on June 24 with 1,300 soldiers, 96 horses, 80 crossbowmen, and 80 arquebusiers. Cort\u00e9s also came with 2,000 Tlaxcalan warriors on the journey.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/> Cort\u00e9s entered the palace unscathed, as the hostilities had not started yet, although the Aztecs had probably planned to ambush him. The Aztecs had already stopped sending food and supplies to the Spaniards. They became suspicious and watched for people trying to sneak supplies to them; many innocent people were slaughtered because they were suspected of helping them.<ref name=\"spears\">*{{cite book |author=Le\u00f3n-Portilla, Miguel (Ed.) |authorlink=Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla |year=1992 |origyear=1959 |title=The Broken Spears: The Aztec Account of the Conquest of Mexico |others=[[\u00c1ngel Mar\u00eda Garibay K.]] (Nahuatl-Spanish trans.), Lysander Kemp (Spanish-English trans.), Alberto Beltran (illus.) |edition=Expanded and updated |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |isbn=0-8070-5501-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/brokenspearsa00leon }}</ref> A few days after the great forces of Cort\u00e9s got into Tenochtitlan, the roads were shut and the causeway bridges were raised.

The military gains of the attack therefore had a serious political cost for Cort\u00e9s. His new followers were greatly disturbed at the power of the Aztecs, and held Cort\u00e9s to be a liar since nobody revered them and brought them food and gifts as Cort\u00e9s had promised.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\nCort\u00e9s attempted to parley with the Aztecs, and after this failed he sent Moctezuma to tell his people to stop fighting.

It is still remembered as \"La Noche Triste,\" The Night of Sorrows. Popular tales say Cort\u00e9s wept under a tree the night of the massacre of his troops at the hands of the Aztecs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nInitially, Cort\u00e9s resolved to fight the Aztec troops opposed to him and win the city in direct conflict. This stemmed from three errors of judgment:{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n1. Underestimation of the Aztecs. Cort\u00e9s fought the Tabascans, the Cempoalans, the Tlaxcalans and found them strong opponents, but always prevailed. He had never fought an Aztec army before and did not expect such resolve and martial skill as he encountered - although all his previous foes warned that the Mexicans were the greatest warriors they had ever seen and could not be withstood within their city.\n\n2. Overrating his forces. Since Cort\u00e9s won all his battles in Mexico before this while at the head of much inferior forces, being in charge of a nearly full Spanish tercio must have made him feel invincible. In fact, the only serviceable portion of his army were his old followers with great experience of Mexican warfare, who were by this time severely whittled down by wounds and disease. The newly-arrived Narva\u00e9z's men did not have experience in local fighting and were worth much less in combat - and eventually perished in much greater numbers than the veterans.\n\n3. Unprepared for enemy tactics. The Aztecs had fought for the lake cities many times before and their tactics were excellent - the use of canoes, the use of flat roofs with prepared missiles, dropping down into the lake when cornered, and destroying bridges. Cavalry could not operate in these conditions and control of the water was crucial, which Cort\u00e9s did not realize at first.\n\nWith this mindset, Cort\u00e9s launched an attack directly at the chief temple of the city, the Cue of Huichilopotzli. In spite of determined opposition, the Spanish push got them to the top of the temple's 114 steps, but at a great loss. Cort\u00e9s aimed at routing the Aztecs and by holding both Moctezuma and the great temple - being able to offer peace once again. However, the Spanish attack encountered such fierce resistance and numerous fatalities among his men, that the plan fell apart. The retreat to Spanish quarters was as hard as the attack, and part of their quarters were plundered in the meantime. The direct loss of nearly a hundred men dead and the fierce spirit of the Aztecs who refused to be cowed by his ascent of the temple convinced Cort\u00e9s that a night escape was now his only option for survival.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThough a flight from the city would make Cort\u00e9s appear weak before his indigenous allies, it was this or death for the Spanish forces. Cort\u00e9s and his men were in the center of the city, and would most likely have to fight their way out no matter what direction they took. Cort\u00e9s wanted to flee to Tlaxcala, so a path directly east would have been most favorable. Nevertheless, this would require hundreds of canoes to move all of Cort\u00e9s's people and supplies, which he was unable to procure in his position.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\nCort\u00e9s therefore had to choose among three land routes: north to Tlatelolco, which was the least dangerous path but required the longest trip through the city; south to Coyohuacan and Iztapalapa, two towns that would not welcome the Spanish; or west to Tlacopan, which required the shortest trip through Tenochtitlan, though they would not be welcome there either. Cort\u00e9s decided on the west causeway to Tlacopan, needing the quickest route out of Tenochtitlan with all his provisions and people.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\nHeavy rains and a moonless night provided some cover for the escaping Spanish.<ref name=\"serge\"/> On that \"Sad Night,\" July 1, 1520, the Spanish forces exited the palace first with their indigenous allies close behind, bringing as much treasure as possible. Cort\u00e9s had hoped to go undetected by muffling the horses' hooves and carrying wooden boards to cross the canals.\nThe Spanish forces were able to pass through the first three canals, the Tecpantzinco, Tzapotlan, and Atenchicalco.<ref name=\"spears\"/>\n\nHowever, they were discovered on the fourth canal at Mixcoatechialtitlan. One account says a woman fetching water saw them and alerted the city, another says it was a sentry. Some Aztecs set out in canoes, others by road to Nonchualco then Tlacopan to cut the Spanish off. The Aztecs attacked the fleeing Spanish on the Tlacopan causeway from canoes, shooting arrows at them. The Spanish fired their crossbows and arquebuses, but were unable to see their attackers or get into formation. Many Spaniards leaped into the water and drowned, weighed down by armor and booty.<ref name=\"spears\"/>\n\nWhen faced with a gap in the causeway, Alvarado made the famous \"leap of Alvarado\" using a spear to get to the other side. Approximately a third of the Spaniards succeeding in reaching the mainland, while the remaining ones died in battle or were captured and later sacrificed on Aztec altars - these were reported to be mostly the followers of Narvaez, less experienced and more weighted down with gold, which was handed out freely before the escape.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAfter crossing over the bridge, the surviving Spanish had little reprieve before the Aztecs appeared to attack and chase them towards Tlacopan. When they arrived at Tlacopan, a good number of Spaniards had been killed, as well as most of the indigenous warriors, and some of the horses; all of the cannons and most of the crossbows and other weapons were lost. In all battles with main Aztec forces after that, Spaniards noted their lost arms being used against them.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/> The Spanish finally found refuge in Otancalpolco, where they were aided by the Teocalhueyacans. The morning after, the Aztecs returned to recover the spoils from the canals.<ref name=\"spears\"/>\n\nTo reach Tlaxcala, Cort\u00e9s had to bring his troops around Lake Texcoco. Though the Spanish were under attack the entire trip, because Cort\u00e9s took his troops through the northern towns, they were at an advantage. The northern valley was less populous, travel was difficult, and it was still the agricultural season, so the attacks on Cort\u00e9s's forces were not very heavy. As Cort\u00e9s arrived in more densely inhabited areas east of the lake, the attacks were more forceful.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\n=== Battle of Otumba ===\n{{Further|Battle of Otumba}}\n\n[[File:The battle of Otumba.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Battle of Otumba]]]]\nBefore reaching Tlaxcala, the scanty Spanish forces arrived at the plain of [[Otumba de G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas|Otumba Valley (Otompan)]], where they were met by a vast Aztec army intent on their destruction. The Aztecs intended to cut short the Spanish retreat from Tenochtitlan and annihilate them. Here, the Aztecs made their own errors of judgement by underestimating the shock value of the Spanish [[Knight|caballeros]] because all they had seen was the horses traveling gingerly on the wet paved streets of Tenochtitlan. They had never seen them used in open battle on the plains. By marshalling on an open plain, they also allowed experienced Spanish commanders to bring to bear their own tactics, weaponry, and the know-how of European warfare.<ref name=\"serge\"/>\n\nDespite the overwhelming numbers of Aztecs and the generally poor condition of the Spanish survivors, Cort\u00e9s snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. He spotted the Aztec commander in his ornate and colourful feather [[tlahuiztli]] and immediately charged him with several horsemen, killing the Aztec commander and most other leaders as they were clearly marked by their golden plumage and an easy target for a charge. The many Tlaxcalan allies of the Spanish are mentioned as playing an important role in the battle, armed with Spanish swords and shields. The Spanish suffered some losses, but were victorious over the Aztecs, who then retreated and were pursued by cavalry.<ref name=\"serge\"/>\n\nWhen Cort\u00e9s finally reached Tlaxcala five days after fleeing Tenochtitlan, he had lost over 860 Spanish soldiers, over a thousand Tlaxcalans, as well as Spanish women who had accompanied Narv\u00e1ez's troops.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/> Cort\u00e9s claimed only 15 Spaniards were lost along with 2,000 native allies. Cano, another primary source, gives 1,150 Spaniards dead, though this figure was likely too high and might encompass the total loss from entering Mexico to arriving into Tlaxcala. Cort\u00e9s' chaplain back in Spain, [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]], estimated that 450 Spaniards and 4,000 allies had died. Other sources estimate that nearly half of the Spanish and almost all of the natives were killed or wounded.<ref name=\"serge\"/>\n\nThe women survivors included Cort\u00e9s's translator and lover [[La Malinche]], [[Mar\u00eda Estrada]], and two of Moctezuma's daughters who had been given to Cort\u00e9s, including the emperor's favorite and reportedly most beautiful daughter Tecuichpotzin (later Do\u00f1a [[Isabel Moctezuma]]). A third daughter died, leaving behind her infant by Cort\u00e9s, the mysterious second \"Mar\u00eda\" named in his will.\n\n==Both sides attempt to recover==\n\n===Shifting alliances===\nCuitl\u00e1huac had been elected as the emperor immediately following Moctezuma's death. It was necessary for him to prove his power and authority to keep the tributaries from revolting. Usually, the new king would take his army on a campaign before coronation; this demonstration would solidify necessary ties. However, Cuitl\u00e1huac was not in a position to do this, as it was not yet war season; therefore, allegiance to the Spanish seemed to be an option for many tributaries. The Aztec empire was very susceptible to division: most of the tributary states were divided internally, and their loyalty to the Aztecs was based either on their own interests or fear of punishment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIt was necessary for Cort\u00e9s to rebuild his alliances after his escape from Tenochtitlan before he could try again to take the city. He started with the Tlaxcalans. Tlaxcala was an autonomous state, and a fierce enemy of the Aztecs. Another strong motivation to join forces with the Spanish was that Tlaxcala was encircled by Aztec tributaries. The Tlaxcalans could have crushed the Spaniards at this point or turned them over to the Aztecs. In fact, the Aztecs sent emissaries promising peace and prosperity if they would do just that. The Tlaxcalan leaders rebuffed the overtures of the Aztec emissaries, deciding to continue their friendship with Cort\u00e9s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nCort\u00e9s managed to negotiate an alliance; however, the Tlaxcalans required heavy concessions from Cort\u00e9s for their continued support, which he was to provide after they defeated the Aztecs. They expected the Spanish to pay for their supplies, to have the city of Cholula, an equal share of any of the spoils, the right to build a citadel in Tenochtitlan, and finally, to be exempted from any future tribute. Cort\u00e9s was willing to promise anything in the name of the King of Spain, and agreed to their demands. The Spanish did complain about having to pay for their food and water with their gold and other jewels with which they had escaped Tenochtitlan. The Spanish authorities would later disown this treaty with the Tlaxcalans after the fall of Tenochtitlan.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nCort\u00e9s needed to gain other new allies as well. If the Spaniards were able to prove they could protect their new allies from the possibility of Aztec retribution, changing sides would not be too difficult for other tributaries. After Cort\u00e9s' forces managed to defeat the smaller armies of some Aztec tributary states, Tepeyac, and later, Yauhtepec and Cuauhnahuac were easily won over. Cort\u00e9s also used political maneuvering to assure the allegiance of other states, such as Tetzcoco. In addition, Cort\u00e9s replaced kings with those who he knew would be loyal to him. Cort\u00e9s now controlled many major towns, which simultaneously bolstered Cort\u00e9s's forces while weakening the Aztecs.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\nThough the largest group of indigenous allies were Tlaxcalans, the Huexotzinco, Atlixco, Tliliuhqui-Tepecs, Tetzcocans, Chalca, Alcohua and Tepanecs were all important allies as well, and had all been previously subjugated by the Aztecs.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/><ref name=\"serge\"/>\n\nEven the former Triple Alliance member, city of Tetzcoco (or [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]) became a Spanish ally. As the rebellion attempt led by the Tetzcocan Tlatoani, [[Cacamatzin]], in times of Moctezuma's reclusion was conjured by the Spanish,<ref name=\"Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.antorcha.net/biblioteca_virtual/historia/bernal/44.html|title=Capitulo cuarenta y cuatro de Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a, de Bernal Diaz del Castillo.

He was [[Ixtlilx\u00f3chitl II]], who had disagreed with his brother and always proved friendly to the Spanish. Later, Cort\u00e9s also occupied the city as base for the construction of brigantines. However, one faction of Tetzcocan warriors remained loyal to the Aztecs.<ref name=\"enlace externo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.edomexico.gob.mx/identidad/civica/html/conquista.html|title=Identidad Mexiquense|date=9 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209233616/http://www.edomexico.gob.mx/identidad/civica/html/conquista.html|archive-date=2007-02-09}}</ref>\n\nCort\u00e9s had to put down internal struggles among the Spanish troops as well. The remaining Spanish soldiers were somewhat divided; many wanted nothing more than to go home, or at the very least to return to Vera Cruz and wait for reinforcements. Cort\u00e9s hurriedly quashed this faction, determined to finish what he had started. Not only had he staked everything he had or could borrow on this enterprise, he had completely compromised himself by defying his superior [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar|Vel\u00e1zquez]]. He knew that in defeat he would be considered a traitor to Spain, but that in success he would be its hero. So he argued, cajoled, bullied and coerced his troops, and they began preparing for the siege of Mexico. In this Cort\u00e9s showed skill at exploiting the divisions within and between the Aztec states while hiding those of his own troops.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\n===Smallpox reduces the local population===\nWhile Cort\u00e9s was rebuilding his alliances and garnering more supplies, a [[smallpox]] epidemic struck the natives of the Valley of Mexico, including Tenochtitlan. The disease was probably carried by a Spanish slave from Narv\u00e1ez's forces, who had been abandoned in the capital during the Spanish flight.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/> Smallpox played a crucial role in the Spanish success during the Siege of Tenochtitlan from 1519\u20131521, a fact not mentioned in some historical accounts. The disease broke out in Tenochtitlan in late October 1520. The epidemic lasted sixty days, ending by early December.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Le\u00f3n, Portilla Miguel. 2006 The Broken Spears: the Aztec Account of the Conquest of Mexico. Boston: Beacon</ref>\n\nIt was at this event where firsthand accounts were recorded in the Florentine Codex concerning the adverse effects of the smallpox epidemic of the Aztecs, which stated, \"many died from this plague, and many others died of hunger. They could not get up and search for food, and everyone else was too sick to care for them, so they starved to death in their beds. By the time the danger was recognized, the plague was well established that nothing could halt it\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The smallpox epidemic caused not only infection to the Mexica peoples, but it weakened able bodied people who could no longer grow and harvest their crops, which in turn led to mass famine and death from malnutrition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> While the population of Tenochtitlan was recovering, the disease continued to Chalco, a city on the southeast corner of Lake Texcoco that was formerly controlled by the Aztecs but now occupied by the Spanish.<ref name=\"Sahagun\"/>\n\nReproduction and population growth declined since people of child-bearing age either had to fight off the Spanish invasion or died due to famine, malnutrition or other diseases.<ref>(Leon-Portilla 1962: 117, Le\u00f3n, Portilla Miguel. 2006 The Broken Spears: the Aztec Account of the Conquest of Mexico. Boston: Beacon</ref> Diseases like smallpox could travel great distances and spread throughout large populations, which was the case with the Aztecs having lost approximately 50% of its population from smallpox and other diseases.<ref>(Diamond 1999: 210), Diamond, Jared M. 1999 Guns, Germs, and Steel: the Fates of Human Societies. New York: Norton.</ref> The disease killed an estimated forty percent of the native population in the area within a year. The Aztecs codices give ample depictions of the disease's progression. It was known to them as the ''huey ahuizotl'' (great rash).{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nCuitlahuac contracted the disease and died after ruling for eighty days. Though the disease also affected the Spanish-aligned forces somewhat, it had more dire consequences for the leadership on the side of the Aztecs, as they were much harder hit by the smallpox than the Spanish leaders, who were largely resistant to the disease.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Aztecs regroup===\nIt is often debated why the Aztecs took little action against the Spanish and their allies after they fled the city. One reason was that Tenochtitlan was certainly in a state of disorder: the smallpox disease ravaged the population, killing still more important leaders and nobles, and a new king, [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]], son of King [[Ahuitzotl]], was placed on the throne in February 1521. The people were in the process of mourning the dead and rebuilding their damaged city. It is possible that the Aztecs truly believed that the Spanish were gone for good. In addition, Cort\u00e9s astutely directed his forces in multiple directions in preparing his encirclement of the Aztec capital, and knew how to use the military initiative that he gained after the battle of Otumba.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\nStaying within Tenochtitlan as a defensive tactic may have seemed like a reliable strategy at the time. This would allow them the largest possible army that would be close to its supplies, while affording them the mobility provided by the surrounding lake. Any Spanish assault would have to come through the causeways, where the Aztecs could easily attack them. As the only Aztec victory against the Spanish was won in the city using their peculiar urban warfare tactics, and as they counted on retaining control over the water, it seems natural that they wanted to risk their main army only to defend their capital. However, it would not be correct to infer that the Aztecs were passive observers of their fate - they did send numerous expeditions to aid their allies against Cort\u00e9s at every point, with 10 to 20 thousand forces risked in every engagement, such as in Chalco and Chapultepec. They were driven back every time, and some of the native allies won their own victories over the Aztecs, as their dread of their invincible overlords faded with every success of Cort\u00e9s.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\n==Siege of Tenochtitlan==\n\n===Cort\u00e9s plans and prepares===\nCort\u00e9s's overall plan was to trap and besiege the Aztecs within their capital. Cort\u00e9s intended to do that primarily by increasing his power and mobility on the lake, while protecting \"his flanks while they marched up the causeway\", previously one of his main weaknesses. He ordered the construction of thirteen [[sloop]]s (brigantines) in Tlaxcala, by his master shipbuilder, Mart\u00edn L\u00f3pez. Cort\u00e9s continued to receive a steady stream of supplies from ships arriving at Vera Cruz, one ship from Spain loaded with \"arms and powder\", and two ships intended for Narv\u00e1ez. Cort\u00e9s also received one hundred and fifty soldiers and twenty horses from the abandoned [[Panuco river]] settlement. A large source of succour for Cort\u00e9s were the misguided expeditions by Francisco de Garay, the Governor of Jamaica, who kept sending ship after ship to aid his original Panuco venture long after it had been destroyed and abandoned; all of these ships and forces ended up reinforcing Cort\u00e9s before the siege.<ref name=Diaz>Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}</ref>{{rp|309, 311, 324}}\n\nCort\u00e9s then decided to move his army to Texcoco, where he could assemble and launch the sloops in the creeks flowing into Lake Texcoco. With his main headquarters in Texcoco, he could stop his forces from being spread too thin around the lake, and there he could contact them where they needed. [[Xicotencatl the Elder]] provided Cort\u00e9s with over ten thousand Tlaxcalan warriors under the command of Chichimecatecle. Cort\u00e9s departed Tlaxcala on the day after Christmas 1520. When his force arrived at the outskirts of Texcoco, he was met by seven chieftains stating their leader [[Coanacoch|Coanacotzin]] begs \"for your friendship\". Cort\u00e9s quickly replaced that leader with the son of [[Nezahualpilli]], baptized as Don Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|311\u201316}}\n\nAfter winning over [[Chalco (alt\u00e9petl)|Chalco]] and [[Tlamanalco]], Cort\u00e9s sent eight Mexican prisoners to [[Cuauhtemoc]] stating, \"all the towns in the neighborhood were now on our side, as well as the Tlaxcalans\". Cort\u00e9s intended to blockade Mexico and then destroy it. Once Martin L\u00f3pez and Chichimecatecle brought the logs and planks to Texcoco, the sloops were built quickly.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|321\u201325}} Cuauhtemoc's forces were defeated four times in March 1521, around Chalco and [[Huaxtepec]], and Cort\u00e9s received another ship load of arms and men from the Emperor.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|326\u201332}}\n\nOn 6 April 1521, Cort\u00e9s met with the ''[[caciques]]'' around Chalco, and announced he would \"bring peace\" and blockade Mexico. He wanted all of their warriors ready the next day when he put thirteen sloops into the lake (misleadingly called \"launches\" in some translations). He was then joined at Chimaluacan by twenty thousand warriors from Chalco, Texcoco, Huejotzingo, and Tlaxcala.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|333}} Cort\u00e9s fought a major engagement with seventeen thousand of Cuauhtemoc's warriors at [[Xochimilco]], before continuing his march northwestward.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|340\u201347}} Cort\u00e9s found Coyoacan, Tacuba, Atzcapotzalco, and Cuauhitlan deserted.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|347\u201349}}\n\nReturning to Texcoco, which had been guarded by his Captain Gonzalo de Sandoval, Cort\u00e9s was joined by many more men from Castile.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|349}} Cort\u00e9s then discovered a plot aimed at his murder, for which he had the main conspirator, Antonio de Villafana, hanged.

He stationed 25 men on every sloop, 12 oarsmen, 12 crossbowmen and musketeers, and a captain. Each sloop had rigging, sails, oars, and spare oars. Additionally, Cort\u00e9s had 20,000 warriors from Tlaxcala, Huexotzinco, and Cholula. The Tlaxcalans were led by [[Xicotencatl II]] and Chichimecatecle. Cort\u00e9s was ready to start the blockade of Mexico after [[Corpus Christi (feast)]].<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|353\u201354}}\n\nCort\u00e9s put Alvarado in command of 30 horsemen, 18 arbalesters and arquebusiers, 150 Spanish foot soldiers, and 8,000 Tlaxcalan allies, and sent him, accompanied by his brother [[Jorge de Alvarado]], Gutierrez de Badajoz, and Andr\u00e9s de Monjaraz, to secure Tacuba. [[Crist\u00f3bal de Olid]] took 30 horsemen, 20 arbalesters and arquebusiers, 175 foot soldiers, and 8,000 Tlaxcalan allies, accompanied by Andr\u00e9s de Tapia, Francisco Verdugo, and [[Francisco de Lugo]], and secured Coyohuacan. [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]] took 24 horsemen, 14 arquebusiers and arbalesters, 150 Spanish foot soldiers, and 8,000 warriors from Chalco and Huexotzinco, accompanied by Luis Marin and Pedro de Ircio, to secure Ixtlapalapan. Cort\u00e9s commanded the 13 sloops.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|356}} Cort\u00e9s' forces took up these positions on May 22.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\n===The first battles===\n[[File:Battle Spanish Otomies Metztitlan.jpg|thumb|300px|An encounter between Spanish and Aztec combatants as depicted in the ''[[History of Tlaxcala]]''.]]\nThe forces under Alvarado and Olid marched first towards [[Chapultepec]] to disconnect the Aztecs from their water supply.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|359}} There were springs there that supplied much of the city's water by aqueduct; the rest of the city's water was brought in by canoe. The two generals then tried to bring their forces over the causeway at [[Tlacopan]], resulting in the '''Battle of Tlacopan'''.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/> The Aztec forces managed to push back the Spanish and halt this assault on the capital with a determined and hard-fought land and naval counterattack.<ref name=\"spears\"/>{{rp|94}}<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|359\u201360}}\n\nCort\u00e9s faced \"more than a thousand canoes\" after he launched his thirteen sloops from Texcoco. Yet a \"favorable breeze sprang up\", enabling him to overturn many canoes and kill or capture many. After winning the '''First Battle on the Lake''', Cort\u00e9s camped with Olid's forces.<ref name=\"spears\"/>{{rp|94}}<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|362}}\n\nThe Aztec canoe fleets worked well for attacking the Spanish because they allowed the Aztecs to surround the Spanish on both sides of the causeway. Cort\u00e9s decided to make an opening in the causeway so that his brigantines could help defend his forces from both sides. He then distributed the sloops amongst his attacking forces, four to Alvarado, six for Olid, and two to Sandoval on the Tepeaquilla causeway. After this move, the Aztecs could no longer attack from their canoes on the opposite side of the Spanish brigantines, and \"the fighting went very much in our favour\", according to D\u00edaz.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|363}}\n\nWith his brigantines, Cort\u00e9s could also send forces and supplies to areas he previously could not, which put a kink in Cuauht\u00e9moc's plan. To make it more difficult for the Spanish ships to aid the Spanish soldier's advance along the causeways, the Aztecs dug deep pits in shallow areas of the lakes, into which they hoped the Spaniards would stumble, and fixed concealed stakes into the lake bottom to impale the launches. The Spanish horses were also ineffective on the causeways.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|364}}\n\nCort\u00e9s was forced to adapt his plans again, as his initial land campaigns were ineffective. He had planned to attack on the causeways during the daytime and retreat to camp at night; however, the Aztecs moved in to occupy the abandoned bridges and barricades as soon as the Spanish forces left. Consequently, Cort\u00e9s had his forces set up on the causeways at night to defend their positions.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|364\u201366}} Cort\u00e9s also sent orders to \"never on any account to leave a gap unblocked, and that all the horsemen were to sleep on the causeway with their horses saddled and bridled all night long.\"<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|372}} This allowed the Spanish to progress closer and closer towards the city.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/>\n\nThe Spaniards prevented food and water from reaching Tenochtitlan along the three causeways. They limited the supplies reaching the city from the nine surrounding towns via canoe, by sending out two of their launches on nightly capture missions. However, the Aztecs were successful in setting an ambush with thirty of their [[pirogue]]s in an area in which they had placed impaling stakes.

On the Tacuba Causeway across Lake Texcoco connecting Tenochtitlan to the mainland along a street now known as ''Puente de Alvarado'' (Alvarado's Bridge) in Mexico City, Pedro de Alvarado made a mad cavalry charge across a gap in the Causeway.<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 58\"/> As Alvarado and his cavalry emerged on the other side of the gap with the infantry behind, Aztec canoes filled the gap.<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 58\"/> Pedro de Alvarado was wounded along with eight men in his camp.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|377}} Alvarado escaped from the ambush, but five of his men were captured and taken off to the Great Temple to be sacrificed.<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 58\"/> Much to their horror, the Spanish from their positions could see their captured comrades being sacrificed on the Great Pyramid, which increased their hatred of the Aztecs.<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 59\">Robinson, Charles ''The Spanish Invasion of Mexico 1519\u20131521'', London: Osprey, 2004 p. 59.</ref> At the end of each day, the Spanish gave a prayer: \"Oh, thanks be to God that they did not carry me off today to be sacrificed.\"<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 59\"/>\n\nCort\u00e9s then decided to push forward a simultaneous attack towards the Mexican market square. However, he neglected to fill in a channel as he advanced, and when the Aztec counter-attacked, Cort\u00e9s was wounded and almost captured. Crist\u00f3bal de Olea and Crist\u00f3bal de Guzm\u00e1n gave their lives for Cort\u00e9s, and sixty-five Spanish soldiers were captured alive. Cuauhtemoc then had five of their heads thrown at Alvarado's camp, four thrown at Cort\u00e9s' camp, six thrown at Sandoval's camp, while ten more were sacrificed to the Huitzilopochtli and Texcatlipoca idols.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|379\u201383}}\n\nD\u00edaz relates, \"...the dismal drum of Huichilobos sounded again,...we saw our comrades who had been captured in Cort\u00e9s' defeat being dragged up the steps to be sacrificed...cutting open their chests, drew out their palpitating hearts which they offered to the idols...the Indian butchers...cut off their arms and legs...then they ate their flesh with a sauce of peppers and tomatoes...throwing their trunks and entrails to the lions and tigers and serpents and snakes.\" Cuauhtemoc then \"sent the hands and feet of our soldiers, and the skin of their faces...to all the towns of our allies...\" The Aztec sacrificed a batch of Spanish prisoners each night for ten nights.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|386\u201387, 391}} The Aztec cast off the cooked limbs of their prisoners to the Tlaxcalans, shouting: \"Eat the flesh of these ''teules'' [\"Gods\"-a reference to the early belief that Spanish were gods] and of your brothers because we are sated with it\".<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 59\"/>\n\nThe Aztec continued to attack the Spaniards on the causeways, \"day and night\". The Spanish allies in the cities surrounding the lake lost many lives or \"went home wounded\", and \"half their canoes were destroyed\". Yet, \"they did not help the Aztec any more, for they loathed them.\" Yet, of the 24,000 allies, only 200 remained in the three Spanish camps, the rest deciding to return home.\nAhuaxpitzactzin (later baptized as Don Carlos), the brother of the Texcoco lord Don Fernando, remained in Cort\u00e9s' camp with forty relatives and friends. The Huejotzinco Cacique remained in Sandoval's camp with fifty men. Alvarado's camp had Chichimecatecle, the two sons of Lorenzo de Vargas, and eighty Tlaxcalans.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|388\u201389}} To maintain the advance, Cort\u00e9s razed every neighborhood he captured, using the rubble to fill up canals and gaps in the causeways to allow his infantry and cavalry to advance in formation, a fighting tactic that favored the Spanish instead of engaging in hand to hand street fighting, which favored the Aztec.<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 59\"/>\n\nCort\u00e9s then concentrated on letting the Aztec \"eat up all the provisions they have\" and drink brackish water. The Spaniards gradually advanced along the causeways, though without allies. Their launches had freedom of the lake, after devising a method for breaking the impaling stakes the Aztec had placed for them. After twelve days of this, the Spanish allies realized the prophecy by the Aztec idols, that the Spaniards would be dead in ten days was false. Two thousand warriors returned from Texcoco, as did many Tlaxcan warriors under Tepaneca from Topeyanco, and those from Huejotzingo and Cholula.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|390\u201391}}\nCuauhtemoc then enlisted his allies in Matlazingo, Malinalco, and Tulapa, in attacking the Spaniards from the rear. However, Cort\u00e9s sent Andr\u00e9s de Tapia, with 20 horsemen and 100 soldiers, and Gonzalo de Sandoval, with 20 horsemen and 80 soldiers, to help his allies attack this new threat. They returned with two of the Matlazingo chieftains as prisoners.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|396}}\n\nAs the Spanish employed more successful strategies, their stranglehold on Tenochtitlan tightened, and famine began to affect the Aztecs. The Aztecs were cut off from the mainland because of the occupied causeways. Cort\u00e9s also had the advantage of fighting a mostly defensive battle. Though Cuauht\u00e9moc organized a large-scale attack on Alvarado's forces at Tlacopan, the Aztec forces were pushed back. Throughout the siege, the Aztecs had little aid from outside of Tenochtitlan. The remaining loyal tributaries had difficulty sending forces, because it would leave them vulnerable to Spanish attack. Many of these loyal tributaries were surrounded by the Spanish.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThough the tributaries often went back and forth in their loyalties at any sign of change, the Spanish tried hard not to lose any allies. They feared a \"snowball effect\": if one tributary left, others might follow. Therefore, they brutally crushed any tributaries who tried to send help to Tenochtitlan. Any shipments of food and water were intercepted, and even those trying to fish in the lake were attacked.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/> The situation inside the city was desperate: because of the famine and the smallpox there were already thousands of victims, women offered to the gods even their children's clothes, so most children were stark naked. Many Aztecs drank dirty, brackish water because of their severe thirst and contracted dysentery. The famine was so severe that the Aztecs ate anything, even wood, leather, and bricks for sustenance.<ref name=\"Sahagun\"/>\n\nThe Spanish continued to push closer to Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs changed tactics as often as the Spanish did, preventing Cort\u00e9s's forces from being entirely victorious. However, the Aztecs were severely worn down. They had no new troops, supplies, food, nor water. The Spanish received a large amount of supplies from Vera Cruz, and, somewhat renewed, finally entered the main part of Tenochtitlan.<ref name=\"Hassig\"/><ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|396}}\n\n===The Aztecs' last stand===\nCort\u00e9s then ordered a simultaneous advance of all three camps towards the Tlatelolco marketplace. Alvarado's company made it there first, and Gutierrez de Badajoz advanced to the top of the Huichilopotzli ''cu'', setting it afire and planting their Spanish banners. Cort\u00e9s' and Sandoval's men were able to join them there after four more days of fighting.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|396\u201398}}\n\nThe Spanish forces and their allies advanced into the city. Despite inflicting heavy casualties, the Aztecs could not halt the Spanish advance. While the fighting in the city raged, the Aztecs cut out and ate the hearts of 70 Spanish prisoners-of-war at the altar to Huitzilopochtli. By August, many of the native inhabitants had fled [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]].<ref name=\"spears\"/> Cort\u00e9s sent emissaries to negotiate with the Tlatelolcas to join his side, but the Tlatelolcas remained loyal to the Aztecs. Throughout the siege, the Tlaxcalans waged a merciless campaign against the Aztecs who had long oppressed them as for a hundred years the Tlaxcalans had been forced to hand over an annual quota of young men and women to be sacrificed and eaten at the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan, and now the Tlaxcalans saw their chance for revenge.<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 60\">Robinson, Charles ''The Spanish Invasion of Mexico 1519\u20131521'', London: Osprey, 2004 p. 60.</ref> The American historian Charles Robinson wrote: \"Centuries of hate and the basic viciousness of Mesoamerican warfare combined in violence that appalled Cort\u00e9s himself\".<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 60\"/> In letter to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Cort\u00e9s wrote: <blockquote>\"We had more trouble in preventing our allies from killing with such cruelty than we had in fighting the enemy. For no race, however savage, has ever practiced such fierce and unnatural cruelty as the natives of these parts. Our allies also took many spoils that day, which we were unable to prevent, as they numbered more than 150,000 and we Spaniards only some nine hundred. Neither our precautions nor our warnings could stop their looting, though we did all we could...I had posted Spaniards in every street, so that when the people began to come out [to surrender] they might prevent our allies from killing those wretched people, whose numbers was uncountable. I also told the captains of our allies that on no account should any of those people be slain; but there were so many that we could not prevent more than fifteen thousand being killed and sacrificed [by the Tlaxcalans] that day\".<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 60\"/></blockquote>\n\nThroughout the battles with the Spanish, the Aztecs still practiced the traditional ceremonies and customs. Tlapaltecatl Opochtzin was chosen to be outfitted to wear the quetzal owl costume. He was supplied with darts sacred to Huitzilopochtli, which came with wooden tips and flint tops. When he came, the Spanish soldiers appeared scared and intimidated. They chased the owl-warrior, but he was neither captured nor killed. The Aztecs took this as a good sign, but they could fight no more, and after discussions with the nobles, Cuauht\u00e9moc began talks with the Spanish.<ref name=\"Sahagun\"/>\n\nAfter several failed peace overtures to Cuauht\u00e9moc, Cort\u00e9s ordered Sandoval to attack that part of the city in which Cuauht\u00e9moc had retreated. As hundreds of canoes filled the lake fleeing the doomed city, Cort\u00e9s sent his brigantines out to intercept them.<ref name=\"Robinson, Charles p. 60\"/> Cuauht\u00e9moc attempted to flee with his property, gold, jewels, and family in fifty pirogues, but was soon captured by Sandoval's launches, and brought before Cort\u00e9s.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|401\u201303}}\n\n==The surrender==\n[[File:El suplicio de Cuauht\u00e9moc.jpg|thumb|300px|right|\"The Torture of [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]]\", a 19th-century painting by [[Leandro Izaguirre]]]]\nThe Aztec forces were destroyed and the Aztecs surrendered on 13 August 1521, Julian Date.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|404}} Cort\u00e9s demanded the return of the gold lost during [[La Noche Triste]]. Under torture, by burning their feet with oil, Cuauht\u00e9moc and the lord of Tacuba, confessed to dumping his gold and jewels into the lake. Yet, little gold remained, as earlier, a fifth had been sent to Spain and another kept by Cort\u00e9s. \"In the end...the remaining gold all fell to the King's officials.\"<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|409\u201310, 412}}\n\n[[Cuauht\u00e9moc]] was taken prisoner the same day, as related above, and remained the titular leader of Tenochtitlan, under the control of Cort\u00e9s, until he was hanged for treason in 1525 while accompanying a Spanish expedition to Guatemala.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Casualties and atrocities===\n[[File:LastDaysofTenochtitlanB.jpg|thumb|250px|left|\"The Last Days of [[Tenochtitlan]], [[Conquest of Mexico]] by Cortez\", a 19th-century painting by [[William de Leftwich Dodge]].]]\n\n100,000<ref name=grosshumanrights/> to 240,000<ref name=twofor/><ref name=toofor/> were killed in the campaign overall including warriors and civilians.
