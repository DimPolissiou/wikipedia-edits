The diamond was part of the [[Sikh emperors|Sikhl]] [[Peacock Throne]]. It changed hands between various factions in south and west Asia, until being ceded to [[Queen Victoria]] after the [[Second Kidnapping Duleep singh ( The Last Maharaja Of punjab |British annexation]] of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] in 1849.\n\nOriginally, the stone was of a similar cut to other [[Mughal Empire|Mughal-era]] diamonds, like the [[Darya-i-Noor]], which are now in the [[Iranian Crown Jewels]]. In 1851, it went on display at the [[Great Exhibition]] in London, but the lacklustre cut failed to impress viewers. [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], husband of Queen Victoria, ordered it to be re-cut as an oval brilliant by [[Coster Diamonds]]. By modern standards, the culet (point at the bottom of a gemstone) is unusually broad, giving the impression of a black hole when the stone is viewed head-on; it is nevertheless regarded by gemologists as \"full of life\".<ref>Howie, p. 293.</ref>\n\nBecause its history involves a great deal of fighting between men, the Koh-i-Noor acquired a reputation within the [[British royal family]] for bringing bad luck to any man who wears it.<!--cited end of paragraph--> Since arriving in the UK, it has only been worn by female members of the family.<ref>Mears, et al., p. 27.</ref> Victoria wore the stone in a brooch and a circlet. After she died in 1901, it was set in the [[Crown of Queen Alexandra]], wife of [[Edward VII]]. It was transferred to the [[Crown of Queen Mary]] in 1911, and finally to the [[Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Crown of Queen Elizabeth]] (later known as the Queen Mother) in 1937 for her coronation as Queen consort.\n\nToday, the diamond is on public display in the [[Jewel House]] at the [[Tower of London]], where it is seen by millions of visitors each year. The governments of India, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan have all claimed rightful ownership of the Koh-i-Noor and demanded its return ever since India gained independence from the UK in 1947. The British government insists the gem was obtained legally under the terms of the [[Treaty of Lahore#Text of the 1849 Last Treaty of Lahore|Last Treaty of Lahore]] and has rejected the claims.<!-- all cited within article body -->\n\n== History ==\n=== Origin ===\nThe diamond may have been mined from [[Kollur Mine]],<ref>Fanthorpe, p. 202.</ref><ref>Mears (1988), p. 100.</ref> a series of {{convert|4|m|ft|adj=on}} deep [[Gravel pit|gravel-clay pits]] on the banks of [[Krishna River]] in the [[Golconda Sultanate|Golconda]] (present-day <!--It is in Andhra Pradesh not Telangana-->[[Andhra Pradesh]]<!--It is not in Telangana-->), [[India]].<ref>Kurien, p. 112.</ref> It is impossible to know exactly when or where it was found, and many unverifiable theories exist as to its original owner.<ref name=\"rose32\">Rose, p. 32.</ref>\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[Babur]], the [[Turco-Mongol]] founder of the [[Mughal Empire]], wrote about a \"famous\" diamond that weighed just over 187 old carats \u2013&nbsp;approximately the size of the 186-carat Koh-i-Noor.<ref>Streeter, pp. 116\u2013117, 130.</ref> Some historians think Babur's diamond is the earliest reliable reference to the Koh-i-Noor.<ref>Lafont, p. 48.</ref> According to his diary, it was acquired by [[Alauddin Khalji]], second ruler of the [[Khalji dynasty]] of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], when he [[Alauddin Khalji#Marwar and southern campaigns, 1307\u20131313|invaded the kingdoms of southern India]] at the beginning of the 14th&nbsp;century and was probably in the possession of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book |title=India Before Europe |last1=Asher |first1=Catherine B. |last2=Talbot |first2=Cynthia |date=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-52180-904-7 |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvaGuaJIJgoC&pg=PA40# |accessdate=20 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref> It later passed to succeeding dynasties of the Sultanate, and Babur received the diamond in 1526 as a tribute for his conquest of [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]] at the [[Battle of Panipat (1526)|Battle of Panipat]].<ref name=\"rose32\"/>\n\n[[Shah Jahan]], the fifth Mughal emperor, had the stone placed into his ornate [[Peacock Throne]].

After the jewelers confirmed its genuineness, he donated 125,000 rupees to Shuja. Ranjit Singh then asked the principal jewelers of Amritsar to estimate the diamond's value; the jewelers declared that the value of the diamond was \"far beyond all computation\".{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=83}} Ranjit Singh then fixed the diamond in the front of his turban, and paraded on an elephant to enable his subjects to see the diamond.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|pp=83-84}} He used to wear it as an armlet during major festivals such as [[Diwali]] and [[Dusserah]], and took it with him during travel. He would exhibit it to prominent visitors, especially British officers.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=84}}\n\nOne day, Ranjit Singh asked the diamond's former owners - Shuja and his wife Wafa Begum - to estimate its value. Wafa Begum replied that if a strong man threw a stone in four cardinal directions and vertically, Koh-i-Noor would be worth more than the gold and precious stones filled in the space. Ranjit Singh grew paranoid about the Koh-i-Noor being stolen, because in the past, another valuable jewel had been stolen from him while he was intoxicated. He kept the diamond within a high-security facility at the [[Gobindgarh Fort]] when it was not in use. When the diamond was to be transported, it was placed in a [[pannier]] on a guarded camel; 39 other camels with identical panniers were included in the convoy; the diamond was always placed on the first camel immediately behind the guards, but great secrecy was maintained regarding which camel carried it.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=84}} Only Ranjit Singh's treasurer Misr Beli Ram knew which camel carried the diamond.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=106}}\n\nIn June 1839, Ranjit Singh suffered his third [[stroke]], and it became apparent that he would die soon. On his deathbed, he started giving away his valuable possessions to religious charities, and appointed his eldest son [[Kharak Singh]] as his successor. A day before his death, on 26 June 1839, a major argument broke out between his courtiers regarding the fate of Koh-i-Noor.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=91}} Ranjit Singh himself was too weak to speak, and communicated using gestures. Bhai Gobind Ram, the head [[Brahmin]] of Ranjit Singh, insisted that the king had willed Koh-i-Noor and other jewels to the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]] in [[Puri]]: the king apparently supported this claim through gestures, as recorded in his court chronicle ''Umdat ul-Tawarikh''.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|pp=91-92}} However, treasurer Beli Ram insisted that it was a state property rather than Ranjit Singh's personal property, and therefore, should be handed over to Kharak Singh.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=92}}\n\nAfter Ranjit Singh's death, Beli Ram refused to send the diamond to the temple, and hid it in his vaults.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=107}} Meanwhile, Kharak Singh and prime minister [[Dhian Singh]] also issued orders stating that the diamond should not be taken out of Lahore.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=108}}\n\n=== In Gulab Singh's possession ===\nOn 8 October 1839 the new emperor Kharak Singh, was overthrown in a coup by his prime minister Dhian Singh.

Article III of the treaty read: \"The gem called the Koh-i-Noor, which was taken from Shah Sooja-ool-moolk by Maharajah Ranjeet Singh, shall be surrendered by the Maharajah of Lahore to the Queen of England (''sic'')\".<ref>Login, p. 126.</ref>\n\nThe lead signatory of the treaty for the eleven-year-old Maharaja Duleep Singh was his commander-in-chief [[Tej Singh]], a loyalist of Maharaja [[Gulab Singh]] who had previously been in possession of the Koh-i-noor and gained [[Kashmir]] from the Sikh empire, via treaty with Britain, following the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]].\n\nThe [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] in charge of the ratification of this treaty was the [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Marquess of Dalhousie]]. The manner of his aiding in the transfer of the diamond was criticized even by some of his contemporaries in Britain. Although some thought it should have been presented as a gift to Queen Victoria by the East India Company, it is clear that Dalhousie believed the stone was a spoil of war, and treated it accordingly, ensuring that it was officially surrendered to her by [[Duleep Singh]], the youngest son of Ranjit Singh.<ref>Broun-Ramsay, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The presentation of the Koh-i-Noor by the East India Company to the queen was the latest in a long history of transfers of the diamond as a coveted spoil of war.<ref name=\"keay\">Keay, pp. 156\u2013158</ref> Duleep Singh had been placed in the guardianship of Dr John Login, a surgeon in the British Army serving in the [[Presidency of Bengal]].

It was then sent to England for presentation to Queen Victoria in the care of Captain J. Ramsay and Brevet Lt. Col F. Mackeson under tight security arrangements, one of which was the placement of the dispatch box in a larger iron safe. They departed from Bombay on 6 April on board HMS ''Medea'', captained by Captain Lockyer.\n\nThe ship had a difficult voyage: an outbreak of [[cholera]] on board when the ship was in [[Mauritius]] had the locals demanding its departure, and they asked their governor to open fire on the vessel and destroy it if there was no response. Shortly afterwards, the vessel was hit by a severe gale that blew for some 12 hours.\n\nOn arrival in Britain on 29 June, the passengers and mail were unloaded in [[Plymouth]], but the Koh-i-Noor stayed on board until the ship reached [[Spithead]], near [[Portsmouth]], on 1 July.

He sent to London one of his most experienced artisans, Levie Benjamin Voorzanger, and his assistants.<ref name=\"davenport\"/>\n\n[[File:Re-cutting the Koh-i-Noor 1852.jpg|thumb|The 1852 re-cutting]]\nOn 17 July 1852, the cutting began at the factory of [[Garrard & Co]]. in Haymarket, using a steam-powered mill built specially for the job by [[Maudslay, Sons and Field]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Illustrated London News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ze1GAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA54|date=24 July 1852|publisher=Illustrated London News & Sketch Ltd|page=54}}</ref> Under the supervision of Prince Albert and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], and the technical direction of the queen's mineralogist, [[James Tennant (mineralogist)|James Tennant]], the cutting took thirty-eight days.

Another suggestion is that the jewel be housed in a special museum at the [[Wagah]] border between India and Pakistan. However this suggestion does not cater to Afghan claims, nor the reality of current British possession.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=281}} These compromises are presently unaligned with the position of the [[British Government]], which since the end of the [[British Raj]] is that the status of the diamond is 'non-negotiatable'.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=272}}\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Koh-i-Noor made its first appearance in popular culture in ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868), a 19th-century British [[epistolary novel]] by [[Wilkie Collins]], generally considered to be the first full length [[detective novel]] in the English language. In his preface to the first edition of the book, Collins says that he based his eponymous \"Moonstone\" on the histories of two stones: the [[Orlov (diamond)|Orlov]], a {{convert|189.62|carat|g|1|adj=on}} diamond in the Russian Imperial Sceptre, and the Koh-i-Noor.<ref>{{cite book|author=Wilkie Collins|title=The Moonstone: A Novel|url=https://archive.org/details/moonstoneanovel00collgoog|year=1874|publisher=Harper & Brothers|page=[https://archive.org/details/moonstoneanovel00collgoog/page/n14 8]}}</ref> In the 1966 [[Penguin Books]] edition of ''The Moonstone'', [[J.

The diamond was part of the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] [[Peacock Throne]]. It changed hands between various factions in south and west Asia, until being ceded to [[Queen Victoria]] after the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|British annexation]] of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] in 1849.\n\nOriginally, the stone was of a similar cut to other [[Mughal Empire|Mughal-era]] diamonds, like the [[Darya-i-Noor]], which are now in the [[Iranian Crown Jewels]]. In 1851, it went on display at the [[Great Exhibition]] in London, but the lacklustre cut failed to impress viewers. [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], husband of Queen Victoria, ordered it to be re-cut as an oval brilliant by [[Coster Diamonds]]. By modern standards, the culet (point at the bottom of a gemstone) is unusually broad, giving the impression of a black hole when the stone is viewed head-on; it is nevertheless regarded by gemologists as \"full of life\".<ref>Howie, p. 293.</ref>\n\nBecause its history involves a great deal of fighting between men, the Koh-i-Noor acquired a reputation within the [[British royal family]] for bringing bad luck to any man who wears it.<!--cited end of paragraph--> Since arriving in the UK, it has only been worn by female members of the family.<ref>Mears, et al., p. 27.</ref> Victoria wore the stone in a brooch and a circlet. After she died in 1901, it was set in the [[Crown of Queen Alexandra]], wife of [[Edward VII]]. It was transferred to the [[Crown of Queen Mary]] in 1911, and finally to the [[Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Crown of Queen Elizabeth]] (later known as the Queen Mother) in 1937 for her coronation as Queen consort.\n\nToday, the diamond is on public display in the [[Jewel House]] at the [[Tower of London]], where it is seen by millions of visitors each year. The governments of India, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan have all claimed rightful ownership of the Koh-i-Noor and demanded its return ever since India gained independence from the UK in 1947. The British government insists the gem was obtained legally under the terms of the [[Treaty of Lahore#Text of the 1849 Last Treaty of Lahore|Last Treaty of Lahore]] and has rejected the claims.<!-- all cited within article body -->\n\n== History ==\n=== Origin ===\nThe diamond may have been mined from [[Kollur Mine]],<ref>Fanthorpe, p. 202.</ref><ref>Mears (1988), p. 100.</ref> a series of {{convert|4|m|ft|adj=on}} deep [[Gravel pit|gravel-clay pits]] on the banks of [[Krishna River]] in the [[Golconda Sultanate|Golconda]] (present-day <!--It is in Andhra Pradesh not Telangana-->[[Andhra Pradesh]]<!--It is not in Telangana-->), [[India]].<ref>Kurien, p. 112.</ref> It is impossible to know exactly when or where it was found, and many unverifiable theories exist as to its original owner.<ref name=\"rose32\">Rose, p. 32.</ref>\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[Babur]], the [[Turco-Mongol]] founder of the [[Mughal Empire]], wrote about a \"famous\" diamond that weighed just over 187 old carats \u2013&nbsp;approximately the size of the 186-carat Koh-i-Noor.<ref>Streeter, pp. 116\u2013117, 130.</ref> Some historians think Babur's diamond is the earliest reliable reference to the Koh-i-Noor.<ref>Lafont, p. 48.</ref> According to his diary, it was acquired by [[Alauddin Khalji]], second ruler of the [[Khalji dynasty]] of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], when he [[Alauddin Khalji#Marwar and southern campaigns, 1307\u20131313|invaded the kingdoms of southern India]] at the beginning of the 14th&nbsp;century and was probably in the possession of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book |title=India Before Europe |last1=Asher |first1=Catherine B. |last2=Talbot |first2=Cynthia |date=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-52180-904-7 |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvaGuaJIJgoC&pg=PA40# |accessdate=20 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref> It later passed to succeeding dynasties of the Sultanate, and Babur received the diamond in 1526 as a tribute for his conquest of [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]] at the [[Battle of Panipat (1526)|Battle of Panipat]].<ref name=\"rose32\"/>\n\n[[Shah Jahan]], the fifth Mughal emperor, had the stone placed into his ornate [[Peacock Throne]].

After the jewelers confirmed its genuineness, he donated 125,000 rupees to Shuja. Ranjit Singh then asked the principal jewelers of Amritsar to estimate the diamond's value; the jewelers declared that the value of the diamond was \"far beyond all computation\".{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=83}} Ranjit Singh then fixed the diamond in the front of his turban, and paraded on an elephant to enable his subjects to see the diamond.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|pp=83-84}} He used to wear it as an armlet during major festivals such as [[Diwali]] and [[Dusserah]], and took it with him during travel. He would exhibit it to prominent visitors, especially British officers.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=84}}\n\nOne day, Ranjit Singh asked the diamond's former owners - Shuja and his wife Wafa Begum - to estimate its value. Wafa Begum replied that if a strong man threw a stone in four cardinal directions and vertically, Koh-i-Noor would be worth more than the gold and precious stones filled in the space. Ranjit Singh grew paranoid about the Koh-i-Noor being stolen, because in the past, another valuable jewel had been stolen from him while he was intoxicated. He kept the diamond within a high-security facility at the [[Gobindgarh Fort]] when it was not in use. When the diamond was to be transported, it was placed in a [[pannier]] on a guarded camel; 39 other camels with identical panniers were included in the convoy; the diamond was always placed on the first camel immediately behind the guards, but great secrecy was maintained regarding which camel carried it.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=84}} Only Ranjit Singh's treasurer Misr Beli Ram knew which camel carried the diamond.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=106}}\n\nIn June 1839, Ranjit Singh suffered his third [[stroke]], and it became apparent that he would die soon. On his deathbed, he started giving away his valuable possessions to religious charities, and appointed his eldest son [[Kharak Singh]] as his successor. A day before his death, on 26 June 1839, a major argument broke out between his courtiers regarding the fate of Koh-i-Noor.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=91}} Ranjit Singh himself was too weak to speak, and communicated using gestures. Bhai Gobind Ram, the head [[Brahmin]] of Ranjit Singh, insisted that the king had willed Koh-i-Noor and other jewels to the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]] in [[Puri]]: the king apparently supported this claim through gestures, as recorded in his court chronicle ''Umdat ul-Tawarikh''.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|pp=91-92}} However, treasurer Beli Ram insisted that it was a state property rather than Ranjit Singh's personal property, and therefore, should be handed over to Kharak Singh.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=92}}\n\nAfter Ranjit Singh's death, Beli Ram refused to send the diamond to the temple, and hid it in his vaults.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=107}} Meanwhile, Kharak Singh and prime minister [[Dhian Singh]] also issued orders stating that the diamond should not be taken out of Lahore.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=108}}\n\n=== In Gulab Singh's possession ===\nOn 8 October 1839 the new emperor Kharak Singh, was overthrown in a coup by his prime minister Dhian Singh.

Article III of the treaty read: \"The gem called the Koh-i-Noor, which was taken from Shah Sooja-ool-moolk by Maharajah Ranjeet Singh, shall be surrendered by the Maharajah of Lahore to the Queen of England (''sic'')\".<ref>Login, p. 126.</ref>\n\nThe lead signatory of the treaty for the eleven-year-old Maharaja Duleep Singh was his commander-in-chief [[Tej Singh]], a loyalist of Maharaja [[Gulab Singh]] who had previously been in possession of the Koh-i-noor and gained [[Kashmir]] from the Sikh empire, via treaty with Britain, following the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]].\n\nThe [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] in charge of the ratification of this treaty was the [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Marquess of Dalhousie]]. The manner of his aiding in the transfer of the diamond was criticized even by some of his contemporaries in Britain. Although some thought it should have been presented as a gift to Queen Victoria by the East India Company, it is clear that Dalhousie believed the stone was a spoil of war, and treated it accordingly, ensuring that it was officially surrendered to her by [[Duleep Singh]], the youngest son of Ranjit Singh.<ref>Broun-Ramsay, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The presentation of the Koh-i-Noor by the East India Company to the queen was the latest in a long history of transfers of the diamond as a coveted spoil of war.<ref name=\"keay\">Keay, pp. 156\u2013158</ref> Duleep Singh had been placed in the guardianship of Dr John Login, a surgeon in the British Army serving in the [[Presidency of Bengal]].

They departed from Bombay on 6 April on board HMS ''Medea'', captained by Captain Lockyer.\n\nThe ship had a difficult voyage: an outbreak of [[cholera]] on board when the ship was in [[Mauritius]] had the locals demanding its departure, and they asked their governor to open fire on the vessel and destroy it if there was no response. Shortly afterwards, the vessel was hit by a severe gale that blew for some 12 hours.\n\nOn arrival in Britain on 29 June, the passengers and mail were unloaded in [[Plymouth]], but the Koh-i-Noor stayed on board until the ship reached [[Spithead]], near [[Portsmouth]], on 1 July. The next morning, Ramsay and Mackeson, in the company of Mr Onslow, the private secretary to the Chairman of the Court of Directors of the British East India Company, proceeded by train to [[East India House]] in the [[City of London]] and passed the diamond into the care of the chairman and deputy chairman of the East India Company.\n\nThe Koh-i-Noor was formally presented to Queen Victoria on 3 July 1850 at [[Buckingham Palace]] by the deputy chairman of the East India Company.<ref name=\"keay\"/> The date had been chosen to coincide with the Company's 250th anniversary.<ref>Tarshis, p. 138.</ref>\n\n=== The Great Exhibition ===\n[[File:Kohinoor.jpg|thumb|In the armlet given to Victoria]]\nMembers of the public were given a chance to see the Koh-i-Noor when [[The Great Exhibition]] was staged at [[Hyde Park, London]], in 1851.

After consulting mineralogists, including Sir [[David Brewster]], it was decided by [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the husband of Queen Victoria, with the consent of the government, to polish the Koh-i-Noor. One of the largest and most famous Dutch diamond merchants, [[Coster Diamonds|Mozes Coster]], was employed for the task.

In his preface to the first edition of the book, Collins says that he based his eponymous \"Moonstone\" on the histories of two stones: the [[Orlov (diamond)|Orlov]], a {{convert|189.62|carat|g|1|adj=on}} diamond in the Russian Imperial Sceptre, and the Koh-i-Noor.<ref>{{cite book|author=Wilkie Collins|title=The Moonstone: A Novel|url=https://archive.org/details/moonstoneanovel00collgoog|year=1874|publisher=Harper & Brothers|page=[https://archive.org/details/moonstoneanovel00collgoog/page/n14 8]}}</ref> In the 1966 [[Penguin Books]] edition of ''The Moonstone'', [[J.

He was assassinated during the [[Irish rebellion of 1803]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Arthur Wolfe, 1st Viscount Kilwarden and his wife Anne by Thomas Hickey.jpg|thumb|Arthur Wolfe, 1st Viscount Kilwarden and his wife Anne ([[Thomas Hickey (painter)|Thomas Hickey]], 1769)]]\n\nArthur Wolfe was born at Forenaughts House, near [[Naas]], being the eighth of nine sons born to John Wolfe (1700\u20131760) and his wife Mary (d. 1763), the only child and heiress of William Philpot, a successful merchant at [[Dublin]]. One of his brothers, Peter, was the [[High Sheriff of Kildare]], and his first cousin Theobald was the father of the poet [[Charles Wolfe]].\n\n==Career==\nWolfe was educated at [[Trinity College Dublin]] - where he was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|elected a Scholar]] - and at the [[Middle Temple]] in London. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1766. In 1769, he married [[Anne Wolfe, 1st Baroness Kilwarden|Anne Ruxton]] (1745\u20131804), and after building up a successful practice [[took silk]] in 1778. He and. Anne had four children, John, Arthur, Mariana and Elizabeth.<ref>Debrett's Peerage</ref>\n\nIn 1783, Wolfe was returned as Member of Parliament for [[Coleraine (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Coleraine]], which he represented until 1790. In 1787, he was appointed [[Solicitor-General for Ireland]], and was returned to Parliament for [[Jamestown (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Jamestown]] in 1790.\n\nAppointed [[Attorney-General for Ireland]] in 1789, he was known for his strict adherence to the forms of law, and his opposition to the arbitrary measures taken by the authorities, despite his own position in the [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. He unsuccessfully prosecuted [[William Drennan]] in 1792. In 1795, [[William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam|Lord Fitzwilliam]], the new [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], intended to remove him from his place as Attorney-General to make way for [[George Ponsonby]]. In compensation, Wolfe's wife was created '''Baroness Kilwarden''' on 30 September 1795; however, the recall of Fitzwilliam enabled Wolfe to retain his office.\n\nIn January 1798, he was simultaneously returned to Parliament for [[Dublin City (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dublin City]] and [[Ardfert (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Ardfert]]. However, he left the House of Commons when he was appointed [[Chief Justice of the Kings Bench for Ireland]] and created '''Baron Kilwarden''' on 3 July 1798.\n\n===Wolfe Tone===\nAfter the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], Kilwarden became notable for  twice issuing  writs of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' on behalf of [[Wolfe Tone]], then held in military custody, but these were ignored by the army and forestalled by Tone's [[suicide]] in prison. In 1795 he had also warned Tone and some of his associates to leave Ireland to avoid prosecution. Tone's godfather, Theobald Wolfe of Blackhall (the father of [[Charles Wolfe (poet)|Charles Wolfe]]) was Kilwarden's first cousin, and Tone may have been Theobald's natural son. These attempts to help a political opponent were unique at the time.\n\nAfter the passage of the [[Act of Union (1800)|Act of Union]], which he supported, Kilwarden was created '''Viscount Kilwarden''' on 29 December 1800. In 1802, he was appointed Chancellor of the [[University of Dublin]].<ref>[http://www.tcd.ie/chancellor/prochancellor/former/ Former Pro-Chancellors \u2013 The Chancellor : Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin, Ireland<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nDespite his actions on behalf of Wolfe Tone, Kilwarden was hated by the [[United Irishmen]] for his prosecution of [[William Orr (United Irishman)|William Orr]] in 1797, and he had entertained considerable fear for his safety after their failed rebellion. His murder in 1803 is often said to have been a delayed revenge for the death of Orr. Another theory is that it was a case of mistaken identity, the real target being his colleague [[Hugh Carleton, 1st Viscount Carleton]] (although several witnesses said that Wolfe identified himself to his killers, who replied \"You're the one we want\").\n\nIn 1802 he presided over the case against [[Henry Charles Sirr (soldier)|Major Sirr]] in which the habitual abuses of power used to suppress rebellion were exposed in court.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/trialbynisipriu00bencgoog#page/n9/mode/1up ''Trial of Mr John Hevey, Plaintiff and Charles Henry Sirr, Defendant'', John Stockdale, Dublin, 1802.]. Retrieved 4 February 2013.</ref><ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=IDSHnsyqZ8IC&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61 Niles' weekly register, page 61, Volume 20 By Hezekiah Niles, William Ogden Niles. Retrieved 4 February 2013.</ref>\n\n===Father Gahan===\nIn the same year he ordered that the well-known Catholic priest Father [[William Gahan]] be imprisoned for [[contempt of court]]. In a case over the disputed will of Gahan's friend [[John Butler, 12th Baron Dunboyne]], the priest refused to answer certain questions on the ground that to do so would violate the [[priest-penitent privilege|seal of the confessional]], despite a ruling<ref>''[[Butler v Moore]]'' (1802)</ref>(which was overturned in the twentieth century)<ref>''Cooke v Carroll'' 1945 IR 515</ref> that the common law did not recognize the seal of the confessional as a ground for refusing to give evidence. The judge may well  have felt some personal sympathy for Gahan's predicament, as he was released from prison after only a few days.\n\n==Death==\nDuring the 1803 rebellion, Kilwarden, who had never been forgiven by the United Irishmen for the execution of William Orr, was clearly in great danger.  On the night of 23 July 1803, the approach of the [[Kildare]] rebels induced him to leave his residence, Newlands House, in the suburbs of Dublin, with his daughter Elizabeth<ref>His daughter is referred to in contemporary accounts of the murder simply as Miss Wolfe, which could  mean either Mariana (1777\u20131814) or her younger sister Elizabeth (1778\u20131806), but later sources name her as  Elizabeth.</ref> and his nephew, Rev. Richard Wolfe.<ref>''The Parliamentary Register; Or, History of the Proceedings and Debates of ...,'' Vol III, London, 1804, p 876. https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MXpHAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false(accessed 28 February 2017).</ref>\nThinking that he would be  safer among the crowd, he ordered his driver to proceed by way of Thomas Street in the city centre; however, the street was occupied by [[Robert Emmet]]'s rebels. Unwisely, when challenged, he gave his name and office, and he was rapidly dragged from his carriage and stabbed repeatedly with [[pike (weapon)|pike]]s. His nephew was murdered in a similar fashion, while Elizabeth  was allowed to escape to [[Dublin Castle]], where she raised the alarm.  When the rebels were suppressed, Kilwarden was found to be still living, and was carried to a watch-house, where he died shortly thereafter. His last words, spoken in reply to a soldier who called for the death of his murderers, were \"Murder must be punished; but let no man suffer for my death, but on a fair trial, and by the laws of his country.\"\n\nHe was succeeded by his eldest son [[John Wolfe, 2nd Viscount Kilwarden]].

He was assassinated during the [[Irish rebellion of 1803]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Arthur Wolfe, 1st Viscount Kilwarden and his wife Anne by Thomas Hickey.jpg|thumb|Arthur Wolfe, 1st Viscount Kilwarden and his wife Anne ([[Thomas Hickey (painter)|Thomas Hickey]], 1769)]]\n\nArthur Wolfe was born at Forenaughts House, near [[Naas]], being the eighth of nine sons born to John Wolfe (1700\u20131760) and his wife Mary (d.1763), the only child and heiress of William Philpot, a successful merchant at [[Dublin]]. One of his brothers, Peter, was the [[High Sheriff of Kildare]], and his first cousin Theobald was the father of the poet [[Charles Wolfe]].\n\n==Career==\nWolfe was educated at [[Trinity College Dublin]] - where he was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|elected a Scholar]] - and at the [[Middle Temple]] in London. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1766. In 1769, he married [[Anne Wolfe, 1st Baroness Kilwarden|Anne Ruxton]] (1745\u20131804), and after building up a successful practice [[took silk]] in 1778. He and. Anne had four children, John, Arthur, Mariana and Elizabeth.<ref>Debrett's Peerage</ref>\n\nIn 1783, Wolfe was returned as Member of Parliament for [[Coleraine (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Coleraine]], which he represented until 1790. In 1787, he was appointed [[Solicitor-General for Ireland]], and was returned to Parliament for [[Jamestown (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Jamestown]] in 1790.\n\nAppointed [[Attorney-General for Ireland]] in 1789, he was known for his strict adherence to the forms of law, and his opposition to the arbitrary measures taken by the authorities, despite his own position in the [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. He unsuccessfully prosecuted [[William Drennan]] in 1792. In 1795, [[William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam|Lord Fitzwilliam]], the new [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], intended to remove him from his place as Attorney-General to make way for [[George Ponsonby]]. In compensation, Wolfe's wife was created '''Baroness Kilwarden''' on 30 September 1795; however, the recall of Fitzwilliam enabled Wolfe to retain his office.\n\nIn January 1798, he was simultaneously returned to Parliament for [[Dublin City (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dublin City]] and [[Ardfert (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Ardfert]]. However, he left the House of Commons when he was appointed [[Chief Justice of the Kings Bench for Ireland]] and created '''Baron Kilwarden''' on 3 July 1798.\n\n===Wolfe Tone===\nAfter the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], Kilwarden became notable for  twice issuing  writs of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' on behalf of [[Wolfe Tone]], then held in military custody, but these were ignored by the army and forestalled by Tone's [[suicide]] in prison. In 1795 he had also warned Tone and some of his associates to leave Ireland to avoid prosecution. Tone's godfather, Theobald Wolfe of Blackhall (the father of [[Charles Wolfe (poet)|Charles Wolfe]]) was Kilwarden's first cousin, and Tone may have been Theobald's natural son. These attempts to help a political opponent were unique at the time.\n\nAfter the passage of the [[Act of Union (1800)|Act of Union]], which he supported, Kilwarden was created '''Viscount Kilwarden''' on 29 December 1800. In 1802, he was appointed Chancellor of the [[University of Dublin]].<ref>[http://www.tcd.ie/chancellor/prochancellor/former/ Former Pro-Chancellors \u2013 The Chancellor : Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin, Ireland<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nDespite his actions on behalf of Wolfe Tone, Kilwarden was hated by the [[United Irishmen]] for his prosecution of [[William Orr (United Irishman)|William Orr]] in 1797, and he had entertained considerable fear for his safety after their failed rebellion. His murder in 1803 is often said to have been a delayed revenge for the death of Orr. Another theory is that it was a case of mistaken identity, the real target being his colleague [[Hugh Carleton, 1st Viscount Carleton]] (although several witnesses said that Wolfe identified himself to his killers, who replied \"You're the one we want\").\n\nIn 1802 he presided over the case against [[Henry Charles Sirr (soldier)|Major Sirr]] in which the habitual abuses of power used to suppress rebellion were exposed in court.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/trialbynisipriu00bencgoog#page/n9/mode/1up ''Trial of Mr John Hevey, Plaintiff and Charles Henry Sirr, Defendant'', John Stockdale, Dublin, 1802.].

Retrieved 4 February 2013.</ref>\n\n===Father Gahan===\nIn the same year he ordered that the well-known Catholic priest Father [[William Gahan]] be imprisoned for [[contempt of court]]. In a case over the disputed will of Gahan's friend [[John Butler, 12th Baron Dunboyne]], the priest refused to answer certain questions on the ground that to do so would violate the [[priest-penitent privilege|seal of the confessional]], despite a ruling<ref>''[[Butler v Moore]]'' (1802)</ref>(which was overturned in the twentieth century)<ref>''Cooke v Carroll'' 1945 IR 515</ref> that the common law did not recognize the seal of the confessional as a ground for refusing to give evidence. The judge may well  have felt some personal sympathy for Gahan's predicament, as he was released from prison after only a few days.\n\n==Death==\nDuring the 1803 rebellion, Kilwarden, who had never been forgiven by the United Irishmen for the execution of William Orr, was clearly in great danger.  On the night of 23 July 1803, the approach of the [[Kildare]] rebels induced him to leave his residence, Newlands House, in the suburbs of Dublin, with his daughter Elizabeth<ref>His daughter is referred to in contemporary accounts of the murder simply as Miss Wolfe, which could  mean either Mariana (1777\u20131814) or her younger sister Elizabeth (1778\u20131806), but later sources name her as  Elizabeth.</ref> and his nephew, Rev. Richard Wolfe.<ref>''The Parliamentary Register; Or, History of the Proceedings and Debates of ...,'' Vol III, London, 1804, p 876. https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MXpHAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false(accessed 28 February 2017).</ref>\nThinking that he would be  safer among the crowd, he ordered his driver to proceed by way of Thomas Street in the city centre; however, the street was occupied by [[Robert Emmet]]'s rebels. Unwisely, when challenged, he gave his name and office, and he was rapidly dragged from his carriage and stabbed repeatedly with [[pike (weapon)|pike]]s. His nephew was murdered in a similar fashion, while Elizabeth  was allowed to escape to [[Dublin Castle]], where she raised the alarm.  When the rebels were suppressed, Kilwarden was found to be still living, and was carried to a watch-house, where he died shortly thereafter. His last words, spoken in reply to a soldier who called for the death of his murderers, were \"Murder must be punished; but let no man suffer for my death, but on a fair trial, and by the laws of his country.\"\n\nHe was succeeded by his eldest son [[John Wolfe, 2nd Viscount Kilwarden]].  Neither John nor his younger brother Arthur, who died in 1805, had male issue, and on John's death in 1830 the title became extinct.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Wolfe, Arthur, first Viscount Kilwarden (1739\u20131803), lord chief justice of Ireland, by C.

A large bodied lizard, ''Polyglyphanodon sternbergi'', from the Late Cretaceous of Utah is likely an herbivore. The diet is reconstructed based on the tooth shape; a thin transverse blade-like tooth, with fine serrations, similar to living iguanas.<ref name=\"ny\">Nydam, R. L. and R. L. Cifelli. 2005.

Omnivory has evolved independently several times within lepidosaurs, whereas the evolution of obligate herbivory has proved to be more rare. For example, in the Iguania clade, omnivory and herbivory have independently evolved at least nine times. When other lepidosaur clades are included, Cooper and Vitt (2002) demonstrate that omnivory evolved at least 32 separate times. Obligate herbivory, on the other hand, has only evolved 10 times in living, non-liolaemid lizards (nearly 7,700 species). Though, one clade seems to be an exception to this pattern of infrequently developed herbivory. A 2004 study investigated a unique group of South American lizards called the [[Liolaemidae]]. The authors of this study found that this clade evolved herbivory approximately 65 times faster than other squamates. Specifically, herbivory has evolved 18 times in liolaemids (approximately 170 species).<ref name=\"ewt\">Espinosa, R. E., Wiens, J. J. and C. R. Tracy. 2004. Recurrent evolution of herbivory in small, cold-climate lizards: Breaking the ecophysiological rules of reptilian herbivory. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 101:16819\u201316824.</ref> It has been clearly demonstrated that these herbivorous animals have evolved from omnivorous ancestors and not directly from carnivores.<ref name=\"ewt\"/> Unfortunately, many biological studies have not investigated the possible timing that key herbivorous characteristics evolved; leaving the amount of time these organisms have possessed these traits unknown. The distinctions in dietary ecology that are observed today are likely a result of early ecological differences between clades. The separation of the [[Iguania]] and [[Scleroglossa]] (a group including [[geckos]], [[snakes]], [[skinks]], and [[varanids]]) clades in the late Triassic best demonstrates this. It is hypothesized that the early Scleroglossa possessed traits that were better suited for hunting, such as the ability to distinguish prey by means of chemical processes, whereas the Iguania did not possess these traits.<ref>Vitt, L.

The majority of the animals that have been studied utilize plant material for nearly 100% of their diet, and therefore, the common ancestor of this group was likely an herbivore.<ref name=\"coop\"/> Within the liolaemids, herbivory has evolved at least eight times (though it is estimated to have evolved upwards of 18 times).<ref name=\"ewt\"/> Additionally, the Agamidae evolved herbivory twice, in the genera Hydrosaurus and Uromastyx.<ref name=\"ewt\"/>\n\nHerbivory is rare in species outside the Iguania clade, but is present in isolated squamate groups. Within the [[Scincomorpha]] (a clade that includes skinks), herbivory independently evolves at least seven times. Specifically, herbivory independently develops at least once in the [[Lacertidae]], [[Gerrhosauridae]], [[Teiidae]] clades, and four times in the [[Scincidae]] (in the [[Corucia]], [[Egernia]], [[Macroscincus]], and [[Tiliqua]] genera).<ref name=\"ewt\"/>\n\n== Diet ==\n\nThere is a diverse range in diets among herbivorous lepidosaurs. The marine iguana, ''[[Amblyrhynchus cristatus]]'', feeds primarily on algae. The spiny-tail lizard (''[[Uromastyx aegyptia]]''), which is found throughout the deserts of the Middle East, feeds mainly on desert grasses. This lizard likely also eats flowering plants, but due to no rain falling during the study period, the animals were not observed consuming these plants.<ref>Cunningham, P. L. 2001. Notes on the diet, survival rate, and burrow specifics of Uromastyx aegyptius microlepis from the United Arab Emirates. Asiatic Herpetological Research 9:30\u201333.</ref> Other herbivores, such as ''[[Ctenosaura pectinata]]'' (the spiny-tail iguana), have a mixed diet, with 52% of its diet composed of leaves, 35% flowers, and 2% of fruits.<ref name=\"coop\"/> This diet stands in stark contrast with an iguana from the same genus, ''[[Ctenosaura similis]]''. This animal's diet is composed of primarily fruit (73%) and leaves (25%), with no consumption of flowers.<ref name=\"coop\"/>\n\nThe [[green iguana]] (''Iguana iguana'') has a similar diet to the spiny-tail iguana, with its diet composed of 52.1% leaves, 7.7% fruit, and 35.2% flowers.<ref name=\"coop\"/> Research has demonstrated that green iguanas are selective in their plant choice, specifically in leaves. Green iguanas, regardless of age, preferentially select immature leaves to eat. Additionally, younger individuals (hatchlings and juveniles) consumed a higher proportion of immature leaves than adults. This selection allows them to access leaves high in protein.<ref name=\"troy\">Troyer, K. 1984. Structure and function of the digestive tract of a herbivorous lizard ''Iguana iguana''. Physiological Zoology 57:1-8.</ref>\nThe diet of the herbivorous varanid, ''Varanus mabitang'', is composed of fruits from palms augmented by the seeds of screw palms and figs.<ref name=\"gaul\"/> Many herbivorous lizards will eat insects in captivity.<ref>Pianka, E. R. and L. J. Vitt (eds). 2003. Lizards: Windows to the Evolution of Diversity. University of California Press, Berkeley, California, 333 pp.</ref> For example, the [[desert iguana]] (''Dipsosaurus dorsalis'') consistently eats mealworms in zoos, whereas in the wild its diet consists of solely plants. The desert iguana also provides an excellent example of seasonal diet changes in herbivorous reptiles. Flowers from the creosote bush make up its diet in the springtime, whereas after the month of May the diet is made up of a more diverse range of plant material.<ref>Pianka, E. R. 1971. Ecology of Two Lizards. Copeia 1:129\u2013138.</ref>\n\n=== Ontogenetic effect on diet ===\n\nThough not well understood for most lizards, the diet of some herbivorous reptiles changes through [[ontogeny]]. This dietary shift is well documented in the spiny-tailed iguana, ''Ctenosaura pectinata''. Insects compose more than 85% of the diet of juveniles, whereas the diet of adults is completely herbivorous.<ref name=\"dur\"/> The shift is not due to the inability to consume plant material, as juveniles possess an enlarged hindgut (a feature that demonstrates their ability to digest plant material<ref name=\"dur\">Durtsche, R. D. 2000. Ontogenetic plasticity of food habits in the Mexican spiny-tailed iguana, Ctenosaura pectinata. Oecologia 124:185\u2013195.</ref>). Instead, this ontogenetic change in diet is likely due to growth demands. Juveniles of the genus ''Ctenosaura'' have a higher growth rate than other herbivorous reptiles, and insects are a rich source of protein that is easily digested.<ref name=\"dur\"/>\n\tOther ontogenetic shifts in diet involve changes in plant consumption. Juvenile green iguanas preferentially select immature leaves, which are rich in protein, though fiber content is high. Therefore, juvenile iguanas employ a different strategy for attaining the energy necessary for an increased growth rate.<ref name=\"troy\"/>\n\n== Biomechanics ==\n\nHerbivorous lizards possess a number of adaptations that allow them to consume plant material. These adaptations range from changes in tooth morphology to shifts in the digestive system.<ref name=\"zim\"/>\n\n=== Cranium ===\n\nUntil recently, it was believed that the skulls of herbivorous lizards varied little from that of their carnivorous relatives.<ref name=\"king\"/> Using a technique called geometric morphometrics, Stayton (2006) demonstrated that there is convergence to a similar skull shape among herbivorous lizards. The convergent features, which include large orbits, reduced snouts, and a tall skull, allow for a strong bite.<ref>Stayton, C. T. 2006. Testing hypothesis of convergence with multivariate data: Morphological and functional convergence among herbivorous lizards.

One of the first studies was published in 1955 and investigated the correlation between diet and tooth morphology. Hotton (1955)<ref>Hotton, N., III. 1955.

American Midland Naturalist 53:88\u2013114.</ref> found that the tooth morphology did vary with diet, and that herbivorous taxa tended to possess laterally compressed, sharp, cuspate teeth.

The teeth come together and act as scissors, which allow the jaw muscles to act at one point at a time, shearing the plant material.<ref name=\"king\"/><ref name=\"throck\"/> In both animals the fleshy tongue is used to hold the plant material in place as the teeth cut through it.

Unfortunately, little other research has been conducted on the function of herbivorous reptile teeth.\n\n=== Digestive system ===\n\nThe digestive system of herbivorous lizards has undergone significant modification when compared to carnivorous lizards. For example, these animals store symbiotic microorganisms in the foregut and hindgut that specifically aid in the digestion of plant material. Much of the fermentation of the plant material occurs in the hindgut, or colon, where symbiotic organisms breakdown plant material that has otherwise been resistant to digestion.<ref name=\"king\"/><ref name=\"troy\"/> In both small and large lizards the small intestine is relatively shorter, whereas the large intestine is relatively longer.<ref name=\"king\"/> There have also been additional transverse valves documented in the large intestine, specifically in ''Ctenosaura pectinata''.

Omnivory has evolved independently several times within lepidosaurs, whereas the evolution of obligate herbivory has proved to be more rare. For example, in the Iguania clade, omnivory and herbivory have independently evolved at least nine times. When other lepidosaur clades are included, Cooper and Vitt (2002) demonstrate that omnivory evolved at least 32 separate times. Obligate herbivory, on the other hand, has only evolved 10 times in living, non-liolaemid lizards (nearly 7,700 species). Though, one clade seems to be an exception to this pattern of infrequently developed herbivory. A 2004 study investigated a unique group of South American lizards called the [[Liolaemidae]]. The authors of this study found that this clade evolved herbivory approximately 65 times faster than other squamates. Specifically, herbivory has evolved 18 times in liolaemids (approximately 170 species).<ref name=\"ewt\">Espinosa, R. E., Wiens, J. J. and C. R. Tracy. 2004. Recurrent evolution of herbivory in small, cold-climate lizards: Breaking the ecophysiological rules of reptilian herbivory. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 101:16819\u201316824.</ref> It has been clearly demonstrated that these herbivorous animals have evolved from omnivorous ancestors and not directly from carnivores.<ref name=\"ewt\"/> Unfortunately, many biological studies have not investigated the possible timing that key herbivorous characteristics evolved; leaving the amount of time these organisms have possessed these traits unknown. The distinctions in dietary ecology that are observed today are likely a result of early ecological differences between clades. The separation of the [[Iguania]] and [[Scleroglossa]] (a group including [[geckos]], [[snakes]], [[skinks]], and [[varanids]]) clades in the late Triassic best demonstrates this. It is hypothesized that the early Scleroglossa possessed traits that were better suited for hunting, such as the ability to distinguish prey by means of chemical processes, whereas the Iguania did not possess these traits.<ref>Vitt, L.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 102:7877\u20137881.</ref> Therefore, the current dietary diversity within the Iguania (including a large number of herbivores) is due to certain traits held by early representatives of this clade.\n\n== Living herbivorous lepidosaurs ==\n\nThere are more than 7,800 species of squamate reptiles living today and approximately 2% of them are herbivorous, though the number is continually increasing<ref name=\"ewt\"/><ref name=\"zim\"/><ref name=\"stu\">Struck, U., Altenbach, A.

The marine iguana, ''[[Amblyrhynchus cristatus]]'', feeds primarily on algae. The spiny-tail lizard (''[[Uromastyx aegyptia]]''), which is found throughout the deserts of the Middle East, feeds mainly on desert grasses. This lizard likely also eats flowering plants, but due to no rain falling during the study period, the animals were not observed consuming these plants.<ref>Cunningham, P. L. 2001.

Asiatic Herpetological Research 9:30\u201333.</ref> Other herbivores, such as ''[[Ctenosaura pectinata]]'' (the spiny-tail iguana), have a mixed diet, with 52% of its diet composed of leaves, 35% flowers, and 2% of fruits.<ref name=\"coop\"/> This diet stands in stark contrast with an iguana from the same genus, ''[[Ctenosaura similis]]''. This animal's diet is composed of primarily fruit (73%) and leaves (25%), with no consumption of flowers.<ref name=\"coop\"/>\n\nThe [[green iguana]] (''Iguana iguana'') has a similar diet to the spiny-tail iguana, with its diet composed of 52.1% leaves, 7.7% fruit, and 35.2% flowers.<ref name=\"coop\"/> Research has demonstrated that green iguanas are selective in their plant choice, specifically in leaves. Green iguanas, regardless of age, preferentially select immature leaves to eat. Additionally, younger individuals (hatchlings and juveniles) consumed a higher proportion of immature leaves than adults. This selection allows them to access leaves high in protein.<ref name=\"troy\">Troyer, K. 1984. Structure and function of the digestive tract of a herbivorous lizard ''Iguana iguana''. Physiological Zoology 57:1-8.</ref>\nThe diet of the herbivorous varanid, ''Varanus mabitang'', is composed of fruits from palms augmented by the seeds of screw palms and figs.<ref name=\"gaul\"/> Many herbivorous lizards will eat insects in captivity.<ref>Pianka, E. R. and L. J. Vitt (eds). 2003. Lizards: Windows to the Evolution of Diversity. University of California Press, Berkeley, California, 333 pp.</ref> For example, the [[desert iguana]] (''Dipsosaurus dorsalis'') consistently eats mealworms in zoos, whereas in the wild its diet consists of solely plants. The desert iguana also provides an excellent example of seasonal diet changes in herbivorous reptiles. Flowers from the creosote bush make up its diet in the springtime, whereas after the month of May the diet is made up of a more diverse range of plant material.<ref>Pianka, E. R. 1971. Ecology of Two Lizards. Copeia 1:129\u2013138.</ref>\n\n=== Ontogenetic effect on diet ===\n\nThough not well understood for most lizards, the diet of some herbivorous reptiles changes through [[ontogeny]]. This dietary shift is well documented in the spiny-tailed iguana, ''Ctenosaura pectinata''. Insects compose more than 85% of the diet of juveniles, whereas the diet of adults is completely herbivorous.<ref name=\"dur\"/> The shift is not due to the inability to consume plant material, as juveniles possess an enlarged hindgut (a feature that demonstrates their ability to digest plant material<ref name=\"dur\">Durtsche, R. D. 2000. Ontogenetic plasticity of food habits in the Mexican spiny-tailed iguana, Ctenosaura pectinata. Oecologia 124:185\u2013195.</ref>). Instead, this ontogenetic change in diet is likely due to growth demands. Juveniles of the genus ''Ctenosaura'' have a higher growth rate than other herbivorous reptiles, and insects are a rich source of protein that is easily digested.<ref name=\"dur\"/>\n\tOther ontogenetic shifts in diet involve changes in plant consumption. Juvenile green iguanas preferentially select immature leaves, which are rich in protein, though fiber content is high. Therefore, juvenile iguanas employ a different strategy for attaining the energy necessary for an increased growth rate.<ref name=\"troy\"/>\n\n== Biomechanics ==\n\nHerbivorous lizards possess a number of adaptations that allow them to consume plant material. These adaptations range from changes in tooth morphology to shifts in the digestive system.<ref name=\"zim\"/>\n\n=== Cranium ===\n\nUntil recently, it was believed that the skulls of herbivorous lizards varied little from that of their carnivorous relatives.<ref name=\"king\"/> Using a technique called geometric morphometrics, Stayton (2006) demonstrated that there is convergence to a similar skull shape among herbivorous lizards. The convergent features, which include large orbits, reduced snouts, and a tall skull, allow for a strong bite.<ref>Stayton, C. T. 2006. Testing hypothesis of convergence with multivariate data: Morphological and functional convergence among herbivorous lizards.

One of the first studies was published in 1955 and investigated the correlation between diet and tooth morphology. Hotton (1955)<ref>Hotton, N., III. 1955.

[[Film adaptation|Adapted]] from [[Brokeback Mountain (short story)|the 1997 short story of the same name]] by [[E. Annie Proulx|Annie Proulx]], the screenplay was written by Ossana and [[Larry McMurtry]]. The film stars [[Heath Ledger]], [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Anne Hathaway]], and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] and depicts the complex emotional and sexual relationship between [[Ennis Del Mar]] and [[Jack Twist]] in the [[Western United States|American West]] from 1963 to 1983.<ref>Proulx, Annie; McMurtry, Larry; Ossana, Diana (2005, 2006). ''Brokeback Mountain: Story to Screenplay''. London, New York, Toronto and Sydney: Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|978-0-00-723430-1}}.</ref>\n\nLee became attached to the project after a series of attempts to adapt the short story into a film by various directors never materialized. [[Focus Features]] would co-produce it alongside [[River Road Entertainment]] as well as distribute the film. Ledger and Gyllenhaal's casting was announced in 2003, and filming subsequently commenced in various locations in [[Canada]] in 2004. The following year, ''Brokeback Mountain'' premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in September and was released on December 9, 2005.\n\nThe film received critical acclaim, mainly for Lee's direction and Ledger, Gyllenhaal, and Williams's performances, and was placed on many film critics' 2005 top ten lists. It was also commercially successful, grossing $178 million worldwide against its $14 million budget, withstanding issues regarding distribution in a number of countries. The film attained awards for Best Picture and Best Director at the [[British Academy Film Awards]], [[Golden Globe Award]]s, [[Producers Guild of America Award]]s, [[Critics' Choice Movie Award]]s, and [[Independent Spirit Awards]], among others. It also received eight [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, the most nominations at the [[78th Academy Awards]], where it won three\u2013[[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].\n\n''Brokeback Mountain'' was also a subject of controversies, such as its loss to ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] in an upset as well as criticism from conservative media outlets. Conversely, while the sexuality of its characters has been heavily discussed, ''Brokeback Mountain'' has also been regarded as a stepping stone for the advancement of [[New Queer Cinema|queer cinema]] into the mainstream. Years later, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] in 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1963, [[Ennis Del Mar]] and [[Jack Twist]] are hired by Joe Aguirre to herd his sheep through the summer in the [[Wyoming]] mountains. After a night of heavy drinking, Jack makes a pass at Ennis, who is initially hesitant but eventually responds to Jack's advances. Despite Ennis' telling Jack that it was a one-time incident, they develop a passionate sexual and emotional relationship. After Jack and Ennis eventually part ways, Ennis marries his longtime fianc\u00e9e Alma Beers and has two daughters with her. Jack returns the next summer seeking work, but Aguirre, who had observed Jack and Ennis on the mountain, refuses to rehire him.\n\nJack moves to [[Texas]], where he meets, marries, and has a son with rodeo rider Lureen Newsome. After four years, Jack visits Ennis. Upon meeting, the two kiss passionately, and Alma inadvertently observes this. Jack broaches the subject of creating a life with Ennis on a small ranch, but Ennis, haunted by a childhood memory of the torture and murder of two men suspected of homosexual behavior, refuses. He is also unwilling to abandon his family.\n\nEnnis and Jack continue to meet for infrequent fishing trips as their respective marriages deteriorate. Lureen abandons the rodeo, going into business with her father and expecting Jack to work in sales. Alma and Ennis eventually divorce in 1975. Upon hearing about Ennis' divorce, Jack drives to Wyoming. He suggests again that they live together, but Ennis refuses to move away from his children. Upset, Jack finds solace with male prostitutes in [[Mexico]]. \n\nEnnis sees his family regularly until Alma finally confronts him about her knowing the true nature of his relationship with Jack. This results in a violent argument, causing Ennis to abandon his connections with Alma. Ennis meets and has a brief romantic relationship with Cassie Cartwright, a waitress. Jack and Lureen meet and befriend another couple, Randall and Lashawn Malone. It is implied that Jack begins an affair with Randall, as Randall tells Jack his boss has a remote cabin that he can use anytime he wants and suggests they use it together sometime.\n\nAt the end of a regular fishing trip, Jack finds out that to keep his job, Ennis can't meet with him again before November. Jack's frustration leads to an argument, and Ennis blames Jack for being the cause of his own conflicted actions. Ennis begins to cry. Jack tries to hold him and he momentarily objects, but they end up locked in an embrace. Jack watches as Ennis drives away.\n\nSome time later, Ennis receives a postcard he had sent to Jack, stamped \"Deceased\". He calls Lureen, who says that Jack died in an accident after a tire he was changing exploded. As she is speaking, Ennis imagines that Jack was actually beaten to death by a gang of thugs, the fate that Ennis feared. Lureen tells Ennis that Jack wanted to have his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain, but she does not know where it is. Ennis travels to meet with Jack's parents and offers to take Jack's ashes to the mountain. The father refuses, preferring to have them interred in a family plot. Permitted by Jack's mother to see Jack's childhood bedroom, Ennis finds the bloodstained shirt he thought he had lost on Brokeback Mountain. He discovers Jack kept it hanging with his own stained shirt from a fight they had that summer. Ennis holds both shirts up to his face, silently weeping. Jack's mother lets him keep the shirts.\n\nLater, 19-year-old Alma Jr. arrives at Ennis' trailer to tell her father she is engaged. She asks for his blessing and invites him to the wedding. Ennis asks her if her fianc\u00e9 really loves her, and she replies, \"Yes\". After Alma Jr. leaves, Ennis goes to his closet, where his and Jack's shirts hang together, with a postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked above them. He stares at the ensemble for a moment, tears in his eyes, and murmurs, \"Jack, I swear{{nbsp}}...\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Heath Ledger]] as [[Ennis Del Mar]]\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as [[Jack Twist]]\n* [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] as Alma Beers Del Mar\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Lureen Newsome Twist\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Joe Aguirre\n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as Cassie Cartwright\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Lashawn Malone\n* [[David Harbour]] as Randall Malone\n* [[Roberta Maxwell]] as Mrs. Twist\n* [[Peter McRobbie]] as John Twist\n* [[Kate Mara]] as Alma Del Mar Jr.\n* [[Scott Michael Campbell]] as Monroe\n* [[Graham Beckel]] as L.D.

Annie Proulx|Annie Proulx]], the screenplay was written by Ossana and [[Larry McMurtry]]. The film stars [[Heath Ledger]], [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Anne Hathaway]], and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] and depicts the complex emotional and sexual relationship between [[Ennis Del Mar]] and [[Jack Twist]] in the [[Western United States|American West]] from 1963 to 1983.<ref>Proulx, Annie; McMurtry, Larry; Ossana, Diana (2005, 2006).

[[Focus Features]] would co-produce it alongside [[River Road Entertainment]] as well as distribute the film. Ledger and Gyllenhaal's casting was announced in 2003, and filming subsequently commenced in various locations in [[Canada]] in 2004. The following year, ''Brokeback Mountain'' premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in September and was released on December 9, 2005.\n\nThe film received critical acclaim, mainly for Lee's direction and Ledger, Gyllenhaal, and Williams's performances, and was placed on many film critics' 2005 top ten lists. It was also commercially successful, grossing $178 million worldwide against its $14 million budget, withstanding issues regarding distribution in a number of countries. The film attained awards for Best Picture and Best Director at the [[British Academy Film Awards]], [[Golden Globe Award]]s, [[Producers Guild of America Award]]s, [[Critics' Choice Movie Award]]s, and [[Independent Spirit Awards]], among others. It also received eight [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, the most nominations at the [[78th Academy Awards]], where it won three\u2013[[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].\n\n''Brokeback Mountain'' was also a subject of controversies, such as its loss to ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] in an upset as well as criticism from conservative media outlets. Conversely, while the sexuality of its characters has been heavily discussed, ''Brokeback Mountain'' has also been regarded as a stepping stone for the advancement of [[New Queer Cinema|queer cinema]] into the mainstream. Years later, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] in 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1963, [[Ennis Del Mar]] and [[Jack Twist]] are hired by Joe Aguirre to herd his sheep through the summer in the [[Wyoming]] mountains. After a night of heavy drinking, Jack makes a pass at Ennis, who is initially hesitant but eventually responds to Jack's advances. Despite Ennis' telling Jack that it was a one-time incident, they develop a passionate sexual and emotional relationship. After Jack and Ennis eventually part ways, Ennis marries his longtime fianc\u00e9e Alma Beers and has two daughters with her. Jack returns the next summer seeking work, but Aguirre, who had observed Jack and Ennis on the mountain, refuses to rehire him.\n\nJack moves to [[Texas]], where he meets, marries, and has a son with rodeo rider Lureen Newsome. After four years, Jack visits Ennis. Upon meeting, the two kiss passionately, and Alma inadvertently observes this. Jack broaches the subject of creating a life with Ennis on a small ranch, but Ennis, haunted by a childhood memory of the torture and murder of two men suspected of homosexual behavior, refuses. He is also unwilling to abandon his family.\n\nEnnis and Jack continue to meet for infrequent fishing trips as their respective marriages deteriorate. Lureen abandons the rodeo, going into business with her father and expecting Jack to work in sales. Alma and Ennis eventually divorce in 1975. Upon hearing about Ennis' divorce, Jack drives to Wyoming. He suggests again that they live together, but Ennis refuses to move away from his children. Upset, Jack finds solace with male prostitutes in [[Mexico]]. \n\nEnnis sees his family regularly until Alma finally confronts him about her knowing the true nature of his relationship with Jack. This results in a violent argument, causing Ennis to abandon his connections with Alma. Ennis meets and has a brief romantic relationship with Cassie Cartwright, a waitress. Jack and Lureen meet and befriend another couple, Randall and Lashawn Malone. It is implied that Jack begins an affair with Randall, as Randall tells Jack his boss has a remote cabin that he can use anytime he wants and suggests they use it together sometime.\n\nAt the end of a regular fishing trip, Jack finds out that to keep his job, Ennis can't meet with him again before November. Jack's frustration leads to an argument, and Ennis blames Jack for being the cause of his own conflicted actions. Ennis begins to cry. Jack tries to hold him and he momentarily objects, but they end up locked in an embrace. Jack watches as Ennis drives away.\n\nSome time later, Ennis receives a postcard he had sent to Jack, stamped \"Deceased\". He calls Lureen, who says that Jack died in an accident after a tire he was changing exploded. As she is speaking, Ennis imagines that Jack was actually beaten to death by a gang of thugs, the fate that Ennis feared. Lureen tells Ennis that Jack wanted to have his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain, but she does not know where it is. Ennis travels to meet with Jack's parents and offers to take Jack's ashes to the mountain. The father refuses, preferring to have them interred in a family plot. Permitted by Jack's mother to see Jack's childhood bedroom, Ennis finds the bloodstained shirt he thought he had lost on Brokeback Mountain. He discovers Jack kept it hanging with his own stained shirt from a fight they had that summer. Ennis holds both shirts up to his face, silently weeping. Jack's mother lets him keep the shirts.\n\nLater, 19-year-old Alma Jr. arrives at Ennis' trailer to tell her father she is engaged. She asks for his blessing and invites him to the wedding. Ennis asks her if her fianc\u00e9 really loves her, and she replies, \"Yes\". After Alma Jr. leaves, Ennis goes to his closet, where his and Jack's shirts hang together, with a postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked above them. He stares at the ensemble for a moment, tears in his eyes, and murmurs, \"Jack, I swear{{nbsp}}...\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Heath Ledger]] as [[Ennis Del Mar]]\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as [[Jack Twist]]\n* [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] as Alma Beers Del Mar\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Lureen Newsome Twist\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Joe Aguirre\n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as Cassie Cartwright\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Lashawn Malone\n* [[David Harbour]] as Randall Malone\n* [[Roberta Maxwell]] as Mrs. Twist\n* [[Peter McRobbie]] as John Twist\n* [[Kate Mara]] as Alma Del Mar Jr.\n* [[Scott Michael Campbell]] as Monroe\n* [[Graham Beckel]] as L.D.

It was here that they managed to sell the first fifty copies of the [[Safety EP|''Safety'' EP]], which Phil himself had helped fund along with his father (Christopher Harvey) and his Oxford roommate.<ref name=\"coldplay.com\">{{cite web|title=We Interview Coldplay's Manager|url=http://www.coldplay.com/ezine/ezine1.pdf |accessdate=March 30, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111124731/http://www.coldplay.com/ezine/ezine1.pdf |archivedate=November 11, 2007 }}</ref> It is generally considered that this was when he could first be described as the band's manager.\n\nHarvey eventually dropped out of his [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] studies to manage the band; he carried out the role more or less single-handedly until early 2001 when the stress of performing a role usually requiring a team of people forced him to take a prolonged break. He has since stated that the 2001 [[Brit Awards]] was his lowest point:\n\n<blockquote>\nI was feeling like death when I should have been on top of the world. The band picked up awards for Best British Band and Album and all I could think about was how much I wanted to be in bed. It was two days later that my doctor phoned to say she was worried I might be about to slip into a coma.<ref name=\"coldplay.com\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nAlthough Dave Holmes has now taken over as Coldplay's manager, Phil Harvey is still heavily involved in the band's creative output.

He has since stated that the 2001 [[Brit Awards]] was his lowest point:\n\n<blockquote>\nI was feeling like death when I should have been on top of the world. The band picked up awards for Best British Band and Album and all I could think about was how much I wanted to be in bed.
