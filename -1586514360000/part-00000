[[Kottayam Port]] is India's first multi-modal inland container depot. The headquarters of the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], called the Catholicate Aramana (Catholicate palace), is situated at nearby Devalokam.{{citation needed lead|date=January 2020}}\n\nKottayam is home to one of the first English schools in India, and is a leader in literacy, known as '''Akshara Nagari''' (English: land of letters).

Kottayam was then a part of Vempolinad, an area in the [[Venad|Kulashekara Empire]] (800\u20131102&nbsp;AD). By about 1100, the Kingdom of Vempolinad had split into the Kingdoms of Thekkumkur and [[Vadakkumkur]], and the latter became a vassal of [[Kochi|Cochin]]. \n\nThe royal house had originally beeb situated in Vennimala in Kottayam. It was protected by a fort known as Thaliyilkotta and, as a result, the locality came to be known by the same name as the fort. Afterwards, Thekkumkur kings shifted their capital to Nattassery near Kumaranallore at the outskirts of Kottayam town. It is believed that the Thekkumkur dynasty ruled Kottayam from Thazhathangadi. Rulers of Munjanad and Thekkumkur had their headquarters at Thazhathangadi in the present Kottayam town. Marthanda Varma of Travancore attacked Thekkumkur and destroyed the palace and the Thaliyil fort. The remnants of the palaces and forts are still seen here.\n\nThe [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] and the [[Dutch India|Dutch]] established trade relations with both of these kingdoms, dealing in black pepper and other spices. After the subjugation of the Dutch East India Company by the Kingdom of [[Travancore]] in 1742, military operations of [[Marthanda Varma]] progressed against the northern neighbouring kingdoms, including Thekkumkur.\n\nThough Thekkumkur allied with Chempakassery and Vadakkumkoor to protect the kingdom, all of them were finally annexed to Travancore.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.

After the fall of Ambalapuzha, and as the ruler of Thekkumkur refused to come to terms with Travancore, his capital city was taken on 11 September 1750 by [[Ramayyan Dalawa]], the general and prime minister of Marthanda Varma, and the state was annexed to Travancore in 1753.\n\nKottayam then became a part of the Princely State of Travancore.\n\n===Travancore Rule===\nThere existed no institution in the princely state of [[Travancore]] before the 1800s. In 1817, the [[Church Missionary Society]] of England established [[CMS College Kottayam|CMS College]] as the first college in India.

The combined form, Kottaykkakam (\u0d15\u0d4b\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d2f\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d15\u0d02), can be translated as \"inside the fort\".<ref name=\"Kurien\">{{cite journal| author=Kurien L |url=http://ietd.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/354/2/11_chapter4.pdf |title=Structure and functioning of Gramsabhas |year=2010 |accessdate= }}</ref><ref name=\"Kottayam is a compound word- kotta+akam which means the interior of a fort.

Kottayam was then a part of Vempolinad, an area in the [[Venad|Kulashekara Empire]] (800\u20131102&nbsp;AD). By about 1100, the Kingdom of Vempolinad had split into the Kingdoms of Thekkumkur and [[Vadakkumkur]], and the latter became a vassal of [[Kochi|Cochin]].\n\nThe royal house had originally beeb situated in Vennimala in Kottayam. It was protected by a fort known as Thaliyilkotta and, as a result, the locality came to be known by the same name as the fort. Afterwards, Thekkumkur kings shifted their capital to Nattassery near Kumaranallore at the outskirts of Kottayam town. It is believed that the Thekkumkur dynasty ruled Kottayam from Thazhathangadi.\n\nThe [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] and the [[Dutch India|Dutch]] established trade relations with both of these kingdoms, dealing in black pepper and other spices. After the subjugation of the Dutch East India Company by the Kingdom of [[Travancore]] in 1742, military operations of [[Marthanda Varma]] progressed against the northern neighbouring kingdoms, including Thekkumkur.\n\nThough Thekkumkur allied with Chempakassery and Vadakkumkoor to protect the kingdom, all of them were finally annexed to Travancore.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.

After the fall of Ambalapuzha, and as the ruler of Thekkumkur refused to come to terms with Travancore, his capital city was taken on 11 September 1750 by [[Ramayyan Dalawa]], the general and prime minister of Marthanda Varma, and the state was annexed to Travancore in 1753.\n\nKottayam then became a part of the Princely State of Travancore.\n\n===Travancore Rule===\nThere existed no institution in the princely state of [[Travancore]] before the 1800s.

It was introduced among the [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|Native Brazilians]] by [[Jesuits]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] and also observed by all the Portuguese first settlers.\n\nDuring colonial times, there was no freedom of religion. All Portuguese settlers and Brazilians were compulsorily bound to the Catholic faith and were bound to pay tithes to the church. After the Brazilian independence, the first constitution introduced freedom of religion in 1824, but [[Catholicism]] was kept as the [[official religion]]. The Imperial Government paid a salary to Catholic priest and influenced the appointment of bishops. The political-administrative division of the municipalities accompanied the hierarchical division of the bishoprics in \"''freguesias''\" (parishes). There was also some hindrances to the construction of temples and cemeteries that belonged to the [[Catholic Church]]. The first Republican Constitution in 1891 separated religion from state and made all religions equal in the Codes of Law, but the Catholic Church remained very influential until the 1970s. For example, due to the strong opposition of the Catholic Church, divorce was not allowed in Brazil until 1977 even if a separated couple observed a different religion.\n\nThe Catholic faith practiced in Brazil is full of popular festivities rooted in centuries-old Portuguese traditions, but also heavily influenced by African and [[Native Brazilian]] usage. Popular traditions include pilgrimages to the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida|National Shrine]] of [[Our Lady of Aparecida]] (''Nossa Senhora Aparecida''), the [[patron saint]] of Brazil, and religious festivals like the \"''C\u00edrio de Nazar\u00e9''\" in [[Bel\u00e9m]] and the \"''Festa do Divino''\" in many cities of Central Brazil. Areas that received many European immigrants in the last century, specially Italian and German, have Catholic traditions closer to that practiced in Europe.\n\nThe largest proportion of Catholics is concentrated in the [[Northeastern Brazil|Northeast]] (79.9%) and [[Southeastern Brazil|South]] (77.4%) regions. The smallest proportion of Catholics is found in the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Center-West]] region (69.1%). The State of [[Piau\u00ed]] has the largest proportion of Catholics (87,93%) and the State of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] has the smallest one (45.19%).

The [[Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil]], part of the [[Anglican Communion]], has some 120,000 members.

They are concentrated mainly in large urban centers in the Northeast, such as [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], [[Recife]], or [[Rio de Janeiro]] in the Southeast. The cities of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Florian\u00f3polis]] have a great number of followers, but in the South of Brazil the most common African influenced Ritual is Almas e Angola, which is an [[Umbanda]] like ritual. Nowadays, there are over 70 \"terreiros\" (temples) in Florian\u00f3polis, which are the places where the rituals run. In addition to Candombl\u00e9 which is of the [[Yoruba religion]], there is also Umbanda which blends [[Spiritism]] by ways of the same [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] belief system. There is prejudice about \"African cults\" in Brazil's south, but there are Catholics, Protestants and other kinds of Christians who also believe in the [[Orisha]]s, and go both to churches and terreiros.\n\nCandombl\u00e9, Umbanda, Batuque, [[Shango|Xango]], and [[Tambor de Mina]], were originally brought by black [[slavery|slaves]] shipped from Africa to Brazil. These black slaves would summon their gods, called [[Orisha|Orixas]], Voduns or Inkices with chants and dances they had brought from Africa. These cults were persecuted throughout most of Brazilian history, largely because they were believed to be [[Paganism|pagan]] or even [[Satanism|satanic]]. However, the Brazilian [[republic]]an government legalized all of them on the grounds of the necessary separation between the State and the Church in 1889.\n\nIn current practice, Umbanda followers leave offerings of food, candles and flowers in public places for the spirits. Candombl\u00e9 terreiros are more hidden from general view, except in famous festivals such as Iyemanja Festival and the Waters of Oxala in the Northeast.\n\nFrom [[Bahia]] northwards there are different practices such as Catimbo, Jurema with heavy indigenous elements. All over the country, but mainly in the [[Amazon rainforest]], there are many Indians still practicing their original traditions. Many of their beliefs and use of naturally occurring plant derivatives are incorporated into African, Spiritualists and folk religion.\n\nThough these religions have experienced much greater freedom since the decline of the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], they have suffered increasing hostility from [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, with attacks on temples and defacement of statues of the gods.<ref name=\"Mana2007\">[http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S0104-93132007000100003&script=sci_arttext Neo-Pentecostalism and Afro-Brazilian religions: explaining the attacks on symbols of the African religious heritage in contemporary Brazil].

This is mostly because of the large [[Japanese Brazilian]] community. About a fifth of the Japanese Brazilian community are followers of Buddhism. Japanese Buddhist sects like [[Jodo Shinshu]], [[Nichiren Buddhism]] (most notably the [[Soka Gakkai]]), and [[Zen]] are the most popular. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] ([[Vajrayana]]) is also present, since [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]] founded the Khadro Ling center in [[Tr\u00eas Coroas]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] (where he lived until his death in 2002), and many other institutions across the country. However, in recent years both Chinese Mahayana and South East Asian Theraveda sects are gaining popularity. Buddhism was introduced to Brazil in the early twentieth century, by Japanese immigrants, although now, 60% of Japanese Brazilians are now Christian due to missionary activities and intermarriage. Nevertheless, Japanese Brazilian culture has a substantial Buddhist influence.\n\n=== Judaism ===\n[[File:Sinagoga-kahal-zur-israel-recife.jpg|thumb|[[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]], (founded 1636) in [[Recife]] was the first Jewish congregation in the Americas.]]\n[[File:Sinagoga Beth El, S\u00e3o Paulo 2.JPG|thumb|right|A synagogue in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].]]\n{{Main|History of the Jews in Brazil}}\nThe first Jews arrived in Brazil as ''crist\u00e3os-novos'' ([[New Christians]]) or [[conversos]], names applied to Jews or Muslims who converted to Catholicism, most of them forcibly.

They were mainly [[Moroccan Jews]], descendants of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews who had been expelled from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1497.\n\nThe first wave of [[Sephardic Jews]] was exceeded by the larger wave of immigration by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] that came at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, mainly from Russia, Poland, [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]].

The number of PIOs in Brazil has been augmented in recent years by the arrival of nuclear scientists and computer professionals.\n\nThere are as many as 1,500 PIOs among the Indian community in Brazil, and only 400 NRIs since foreign nationals can acquire local citizenship without any discrimination after 15 years of domicile in this country. Brazil has also no bar against dual citizenship. But in recent years, it has been granting immigration visas only in high technology fields. The only exceptions are the [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]] in Manaus (who have formed an Indian Association with about a hundred members) and the [[Goa]]ns in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nBeside the PIOs, there are [[Hindu]] organizations such as [[ISKCON]], [[Brahma Kumari]]s are very active in Brasil. The number of adherents of these organizations is not officially recorded but is estimated to be a few thousand.\n\n===Positivist Church of Brazil===\n[[File:Pretos-velhos.JPG|thumbnail|Old Black Women and Men Spirits Images]]\nMany confuse Spiritism with Afro-Brazilian Religions like [[Umbanda]], [[Candombl\u00e9]] and others that have a following of almost 600,000 adherents. One of the most unusual features of the rich Brazilian spiritual landscape are the sects which use [[ayahuasca]] (an Amazonian [[entheogen]]ic tea), including [[Santo Daime]], [[Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal]], and Centro de Cultura C\u00f3smica.

It was introduced among the [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|Native Brazilians]] by [[Jesuits]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] and also observed by all the Portuguese first settlers.\n\nDuring colonial times, there was no freedom of religion. All Portuguese settlers and Brazilians were compulsorily bound to the Catholic faith and were bound to pay tithes to the church. After the Brazilian independence, the first constitution introduced freedom of religion in 1824, but [[Catholicism]] was kept as the [[official religion]]. The Imperial Government paid a salary to Catholic priest and influenced the appointment of bishops. The political-administrative division of the municipalities accompanied the hierarchical division of the bishoprics in \"''freguesias''\" (parishes). There was also some hindrances to the construction of temples and cemeteries that belonged to the [[Catholic Church]]. The first Republican Constitution in 1891 separated religion from state and made all religions equal in the Codes of Law, but the Catholic Church remained very influential until the 1970s. For example, due to the strong opposition of the Catholic Church, divorce was not allowed in Brazil until 1977 even if a separated couple observed a different religion.\n\nThe Catholic faith practiced in Brazil is full of popular festivities rooted in centuries-old Portuguese traditions, but also heavily influenced by African and [[Native Brazilian]] usage. Popular traditions include pilgrimages to the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida|National Shrine]] of [[Our Lady of Aparecida]] (''Nossa Senhora Aparecida''), the [[patron saint]] of Brazil, and religious festivals like the \"''C\u00edrio de Nazar\u00e9''\" in [[Bel\u00e9m]] and the \"''Festa do Divino''\" in many cities of Central Brazil. Areas that received many European immigrants in the last century, specially Italian and German, have Catholic traditions closer to that practiced in Europe.\n\nThe largest proportion of Catholics is concentrated in the [[Northeastern Brazil|Northeast]] (79.9%) and [[Southeastern Brazil|South]] (77.4%) regions. The smallest proportion of Catholics is found in the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Center-West]] region (69.1%). The State of [[Piau\u00ed]] has the largest proportion of Catholics (87,93%) and the State of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] has the smallest one (45.19%). Among the state capitals, [[Teresina]] has the largest proportion of Catholics in the country (86.010%), followed by [[Aracaju]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Florian\u00f3polis]] and [[Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Para\u00edba|Jo\u00e3o Pessoa]].<ref name=\"Folha\">[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/mundo/ult94u83030.shtml Folha Online - Mundo.

They are concentrated mainly in large urban centers in the Northeast, such as [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], [[Recife]], or [[Rio de Janeiro]] in the Southeast. The cities of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Florian\u00f3polis]] have a great number of followers, but in the South of Brazil the most common African influenced Ritual is Almas e Angola, which is an [[Umbanda]] like ritual. Nowadays, there are over 70 \"terreiros\" (temples) in Florian\u00f3polis, which are the places where the rituals run. In addition to Candombl\u00e9 which is of the [[Yoruba religion]], there is also Umbanda which blends [[Spiritism]] by ways of the same [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] belief system. There is prejudice about \"African cults\" in Brazil's south, but there are Catholics, Protestants and other kinds of Christians who also believe in the [[Orisha]]s, and go both to churches and terreiros.\n\nCandombl\u00e9, Umbanda, Batuque, [[Shango|Xango]], and [[Tambor de Mina]], were originally brought by black [[slavery|slaves]] shipped from Africa to Brazil. These black slaves would summon their gods, called [[Orisha|Orixas]], Voduns or Inkices with chants and dances they had brought from Africa. These cults were persecuted throughout most of Brazilian history, largely because they were believed to be [[Paganism|pagan]] or even [[Satanism|satanic]]. However, the Brazilian [[republic]]an government legalized all of them on the grounds of the necessary separation between the State and the Church in 1889.\n\nIn current practice, Umbanda followers leave offerings of food, candles and flowers in public places for the spirits. Candombl\u00e9 terreiros are more hidden from general view, except in famous festivals such as Iyemanja Festival and the Waters of Oxala in the Northeast.\n\nFrom [[Bahia]] northwards there are different practices such as Catimbo, Jurema with heavy indigenous elements. All over the country, but mainly in the [[Amazon rainforest]], there are many Indians still practicing their original traditions. Many of their beliefs and use of naturally occurring plant derivatives are incorporated into African, Spiritualists and folk religion.\n\nThough these religions have experienced much greater freedom since the decline of the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], they have suffered increasing hostility from [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, with attacks on temples and defacement of statues of the gods.<ref name=\"Mana2007\">[http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S0104-93132007000100003&script=sci_arttext Neo-Pentecostalism and Afro-Brazilian religions: explaining the attacks on symbols of the African religious heritage in contemporary Brazil].

Spiritism does follow Jesus's principal and his moral teachings. With almost 4 million adherents in 2010, is the second largest (???) Religion of Brazil. In mainly Minas Gerais and [[S\u00e3o Paulo State|S\u00e3o Paulo]], large sections of the middle class, about 1-2% of the total population, are [[Kardecist Spiritism|Kardecist]], sometimes pure, sometimes in [[syncretism]] with Roman Catholicism.\n\n=== Buddhism ===\n[[File:Tibetan Buddhist Temple RS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] temple in [[Tr\u00eas Coroas]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]].]]\n{{Main|Buddhism in Brazil}}\nBuddhism is probably the largest of all minority religions, with about 215,000 followers. This is mostly because of the large [[Japanese Brazilian]] community. About a fifth of the Japanese Brazilian community are followers of Buddhism. Japanese Buddhist sects like [[Jodo Shinshu]], [[Nichiren Buddhism]] (most notably the [[Soka Gakkai]]), and [[Zen]] are the most popular. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] ([[Vajrayana]]) is also present, since [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]] founded the Khadro Ling center in [[Tr\u00eas Coroas]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] (where he lived until his death in 2002), and many other institutions across the country. However, in recent years both Chinese Mahayana and South East Asian Theraveda sects are gaining popularity. Buddhism was introduced to Brazil in the early twentieth century, by Japanese immigrants, although now, 60% of Japanese Brazilians are now Christian due to missionary activities and intermarriage. Nevertheless, Japanese Brazilian culture has a substantial Buddhist influence.\n\n=== Judaism ===\n[[File:Sinagoga-kahal-zur-israel-recife.jpg|thumb|[[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]], (founded 1636) in [[Recife]] was the first Jewish congregation in the Americas.]]\n[[File:Sinagoga Beth El, S\u00e3o Paulo 2.JPG|thumb|right|A synagogue in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].]]\n{{Main|History of the Jews in Brazil}}\nThe first Jews arrived in Brazil as ''crist\u00e3os-novos'' ([[New Christians]]) or [[conversos]], names applied to Jews or Muslims who converted to Catholicism, most of them forcibly.

Many Jews came from the Netherlands to live in Brazil in the area dominated by the Dutch. Most of them were descendants of the Portuguese Jews who had been expelled from Portugal in 1497. In 1636, the [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]], the first [[synagogue]] in the Americas was built in [[Recife]], the capital of [[Dutch Brazil]].<ref name=jvt/> The original building remains to this day,<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/922773.html  Synagogue in Brazilian town Recife considered oldest in the Americas].

They were mainly [[Moroccan Jews]], descendants of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews who had been expelled from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1497.\n\nThe first wave of [[Sephardic Jews]] was exceeded by the larger wave of immigration by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] that came at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, mainly from Russia, Poland, [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. A final significant group came, fleeing [[Nazism]] or the destruction that followed World War II.\n\nBrazil has the second-largest Jewish population in Latin America of 120,000 people, making up a total of 0.06% of Brazil's population.<ref name=\"Beit Hatfutsot\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/jewish-community-brazil/|title=The Jewish Community in Brazil|website=Beit Hatfutsot|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> As of 2017, Rio de Janeiro's Jewish population was 22,000, with 24 active synagogues.{{r|Beit Hatfutsot}}\n\n[[File:Mesquita do Br\u00e1s 1.JPG|thumb|right|Mosque in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].]]\n\n=== Islam ===\n{{Main|Islam in Brazil}}\n{{Further|Mal\u00ea Revolt}}\nAccording to the 2010 Census, there were 35,167 [[Islam in Brazil|Muslims]] in Brazil.<ref name=\"census2010a\">ftp://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Censos/Censo_Demografico_2010/Caracteristicas_Gerais_Religiao_Deficiencia/tab1_4.pdf</ref>   The Federation of Muslim Associations of Brazil estimates there are about 1.5 million Muslims and others say about 400.000 to 500.000.

(Muslims were called ''mal\u00ea'' in [[Bahia]] at this time, from [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] ''imale'' that designated a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] Muslim.)  Fearing the example might be followed, the Brazilian authorities began to watch the ''mal\u00eas'' very carefully and in subsequent years intensive efforts were made towards conversions to Catholic Christianity and erase the popular memory of and affection towards [[Islam]].<ref>Joao Jose Reis, ''Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia'', Johns Hopkins University Press, London 1993</ref> However, the African Muslim community was not erased overnight, and as late as 1910 it is estimated there were still some 100,000 African Muslims living in Brazil.<ref>Steven Barboza, ''American Jihad'', 1993</ref>\n\nA recent trend has been the increase in [[Religious conversion#Islam|conversion]]s to Islam among non-Arab citizens.<ref name=religiousfreedom2006>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091130031802/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127381.htm \"Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor International Religious Freedom Report 2009\"] October 26, 2009, US Department of State report on Brazil</ref>\n\n=== Hinduism ===\n{{Main|Hinduism in Brazil}}\nMost of the Brazilian Hindus are ethnic East [[India]]ns. However, there are new converts due to the missionary effects of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]].\n\nThere are 1,500 PIOs ([[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|People of Indian origin]]) and about 400 NRIs ([[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Non-Resident Indian]]) in Brazil.\n\n;First wave of Immigration\nA small number of Sindhis had arrived here from Suriname and Central America in 1960 to set up shop as traders in the city of [[Manaus]].\n\n;Second wave of Immigration \nConsisted of university professors who arrived in the 190s and also in the 1970s.\n\nOther PIOs migrated to this country from various African countries, mainly from former Portuguese colonies (especially [[Mozambique]]), soon after their independence in the 1970s. The number of PIOs in Brazil has been augmented in recent years by the arrival of nuclear scientists and computer professionals.\n\nThere are as many as 1,500 PIOs among the Indian community in Brazil, and only 400 NRIs since foreign nationals can acquire local citizenship without any discrimination after 15 years of domicile in this country. Brazil has also no bar against dual citizenship. But in recent years, it has been granting immigration visas only in high technology fields. The only exceptions are the [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]] in Manaus (who have formed an Indian Association with about a hundred members) and the [[Goa]]ns in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nBeside the PIOs, there are [[Hindu]] organizations such as [[ISKCON]], [[Brahma Kumari]]s are very active in Brasil. The number of adherents of these organizations is not officially recorded but is estimated to be a few thousand.\n\n===Positivist Church of Brazil===\n[[File:Pretos-velhos.JPG|thumbnail|Old Black Women and Men Spirits Images]]\nMany confuse Spiritism with Afro-Brazilian Religions like [[Umbanda]], [[Candombl\u00e9]] and others that have a following of almost 600,000 adherents. One of the most unusual features of the rich Brazilian spiritual landscape are the sects which use [[ayahuasca]] (an Amazonian [[entheogen]]ic tea), including [[Santo Daime]], [[Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal]], and Centro de Cultura C\u00f3smica. This syncretism, coupled with ideas prevalent during the military dicatorship, has resulted in a church for the secular, based on philosopher [[Auguste Comte]]'s principles of [[positivism]], based at the Positivist Church of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n=== Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith ===\n{{main|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Brazil}}\nThe Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Brazil started in 1919 with [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] first visiting the country that year,<ref name=\"alamb\">{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Artemus | title = The Beginnings of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition | publisher = M L VanOrman Enterprises |date=November 1995 | location = 1405 Killarney Drive, West Linn OR, 97068, United States of America | url = http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}</ref> and the first Bah\u00e1'\u00ed [[Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assembly]] in Brazil was established in 1928.

During the 1992 [[Earth Summit]], which was held in Brazil, the international and local Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community were given the responsibility for organizing a series of different programs, and since then the involvements of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community in the country have continued to multiply.

A spiritual successor to 2003's ''[[Freelancer (video game)|Freelancer]]'', ''Star Citizen'' is being led by director [[Chris Roberts (video game developer)|Chris Roberts]] and has become highly controversial during its production. Development of the game began in 2011 and was announced in 2013 through a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign which drew in over US$2 million. While its launch was originally anticipated for 2014, significant expansion of gameplay features and scope have led to repeated delays. In 2013, Cloud Imperium Games began releasing parts of the game, known as \"modules\", to provide players with the opportunity to experience gameplay features prior to release. The latest of these modules, known as the \"Persistent Universe\", was released in 2015 and continues to receive updates.\n\nThe game is noted for being the highest crowdfunded video game and one of the [[List of highest-funded crowdfunding projects|highest-funded crowdfunding projects]] overall. Cloud Imperium Games' methods of generating crowdfunded revenue has led to criticisms and legal issues surrounding the project, though the company still actively campaigns for funding through the sale of ships, land claims, and other in-game items.\n\n''Squadron 42'', a [[Single-player video game|single-player]] game set in the same universe, was initially announced as an included campaign in ''Star Citizen''<nowiki/>'s Kickstarter announcement, but has since been separated into a standalone release.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Star Citizen'' combines features from [[Space flight simulation game|space simulator]], [[First-person shooter|first person shooter]], and [[Massively multiplayer online game|massively multiplayer online]] genres across its four playable modes. These modes, called modules, provide different player experiences from one another. Three of the modules, Hangar, Arena Commander, and Star Marine, provide examples of gameplay features that would appear in the Persistent Universe module, but also have their own mechanics.\n\n=== Hangar module ===\nThe Hangar Module is the first mode of ''Star Citizen'', released on August 29, 2013.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/star-citizen-hangar-module,24065.html|title=Chris Roberts' Star Citizen Hangar Module Goes Live|date=August 29, 2013|work=Tom's Hardware|access-date=August 26, 2017|language=en}}</ref> While in the Hangar Module, players can explore or modify their purchased ships that have been publicly released and interact with the ship's systems, though no flying options are available in the module.

The first case was forwarded to the [[Better Business Bureau]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/13/16767590/star-citizen-refund|title=Star Citizen backer\u2019s $25,000 refund has taken months, still in dispute (update)|last=Hall|first=Charlie|date=2017-12-13|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a discussion with the Better Business Bureau, Cloud Imperium Games made changes to their website and further revised their terms of service.

It was reported that he had \"grown disillusioned with the title's numerous delays, broken promises, and changes in scope\". He argued that changes to the game would limit his ability to play due to disability. In court, Cloud Imperium Games argued that the backer's involvement in an early tester program called \"Evocati\" proved that they were actively providing a product to him. When an [[arbitration]] clause from the project's terms of service was brought up, the backer argued that he was covered under the original terms of service as he had backed the project prior to changes to the terms of service. Cloud Imperium Games provided evidence that a \"vast majority\" of the backer's purchases were made after the change and that he would have had to accept the revised terms of service when making any new purchase. The judge presiding the case sided with Cloud Imperium Games and ruled against the backer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/07/court-denies-star-citizen-backers-4500-refund-lawsuit/|title=Court Denies Star Citizen Backer's $4,500 Refund Lawsuit|access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/star-citizen-backer-sues-to-get-4-500-back-loses-1827666550|title=Star Citizen Backer Sues To Get $4,500 Back, Loses|access-date=July 17, 2018}}</ref> In a report from 2019, it was alleged that the backer continued to purchase ships after the lawsuit was closed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattperez/2019/05/01/exclusive-the-saga-of-star-citizen-a-video-game-that-raised-300-millionbut-may-never-be-ready-to-play/|title=Exclusive: The Saga Of 'Star Citizen,' A Video Game That Raised $300 Million\u2014But May Never Be Ready To Play|last=Perez|first=Matt|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Crytek lawsuit ===\n[[Crytek]], the developers of [[CryEngine]], filed a lawsuit in December 2017 for [[copyright infringement]] and [[breach of contract]] against Cloud Imperium Games.

A spiritual successor to 2003's ''[[Freelancer (video game)|Freelancer]]'', ''Star Citizen'' is being led by director [[Chris Roberts (video game developer)|Chris Roberts]] and has become highly controversial during its production. Development of the game began in 2011 and was announced in 2013 through a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign which drew in over US$2 million. While its launch was originally anticipated for 2014, significant expansion of gameplay features and scope have led to repeated delays. In 2013, Cloud Imperium Games began releasing parts of the game, known as \"modules\", to provide players with the opportunity to experience gameplay features prior to release. The latest of these modules, known as the \"Persistent Universe\", was released in 2015 and continues to receive updates.\n\nThe game is noted for being the highest crowdfunded video game and one of the [[List of highest-funded crowdfunding projects|highest-funded crowdfunding projects]] overall. Cloud Imperium Games' methods of generating crowdfunded revenue has led to criticisms and legal issues surrounding the project, though the company still actively campaigns for funding through the sale of ships, land claims, and other in-game items.\n\n''Squadron 42'', a [[Single-player video game|single-player]] game set in the same universe, was initially announced as an included campaign in ''Star Citizen''<nowiki/>'s Kickstarter announcement, but has since been separated into a standalone release.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Star Citizen'' combines features from [[Space flight simulation game|space simulator]], [[First-person shooter|first person shooter]], and [[Massively multiplayer online game|massively multiplayer online]] genres across its four playable modes. These modes, called modules, provide different player experiences from one another. Three of the modules, Hangar, Arena Commander, and Star Marine, provide examples of gameplay features that would appear in the Persistent Universe module, but also have their own mechanics.\n\n=== Hangar module ===\nThe Hangar Module is the first mode of ''Star Citizen'', released on August 29, 2013.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/star-citizen-hangar-module,24065.html|title=Chris Roberts' Star Citizen Hangar Module Goes Live|date=August 29, 2013|work=Tom's Hardware|access-date=August 26, 2017|language=en}}</ref> While in the Hangar Module, players can explore or modify their purchased ships that have been publicly released and interact with the ship's systems, though no flying options are available in the module.

Site changes were designed to more clearly communicate the state of the project, define the purchase as a \"pledge\", and \u201cinform potential buyers there may be product delivery delays and to check the roadmap site ''before'' he/she chooses to click the final OK box and provide payment.\u201d The new terms of service opened refund requests to a 14-day \"cancellation period\", but Cloud Imperium Games claimed that they also maintained a company policy to refund backers within 30 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://robertsspaceindustries.com/tos|title=Star Citizen TOS 2018|date=January 25, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/12/16997396/star-citizen-better-business-bureau-terms-of-service-changes|title=Star Citizen\u2019s developers met with nation\u2019s leading consumer protection group|last=Hall|first=Charlie|date=2018-02-12|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, a backer initiated a small claims court case against Cloud Imperium Games to refund US$4,496. It was reported that he had \"grown disillusioned with the title's numerous delays, broken promises, and changes in scope\". He argued that changes to the game would limit his ability to play due to disability. In court, Cloud Imperium Games argued that the backer's involvement in an early tester program called \"Evocati\" proved that they were actively providing a product to him. When an [[arbitration]] clause from the project's terms of service was brought up, the backer argued that he was covered under the original terms of service as he had backed the project prior to changes to the terms of service. Cloud Imperium Games provided evidence that a \"vast majority\" of the backer's purchases were made after the change and that he would have had to accept the revised terms of service when making any new purchase. The judge presiding the case sided with Cloud Imperium Games and ruled against the backer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/07/court-denies-star-citizen-backers-4500-refund-lawsuit/|title=Court Denies Star Citizen Backer's $4,500 Refund Lawsuit|access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/star-citizen-backer-sues-to-get-4-500-back-loses-1827666550|title=Star Citizen Backer Sues To Get $4,500 Back, Loses|access-date=July 17, 2018}}</ref> In a report from 2019, it was alleged that the backer continued to purchase ships after the lawsuit was closed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattperez/2019/05/01/exclusive-the-saga-of-star-citizen-a-video-game-that-raised-300-millionbut-may-never-be-ready-to-play/|title=Exclusive: The Saga Of 'Star Citizen,' A Video Game That Raised $300 Million\u2014But May Never Be Ready To Play|last=Perez|first=Matt|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Crytek lawsuit ===\n[[Crytek]], the developers of [[CryEngine]], filed a lawsuit in December 2017 for [[copyright infringement]] and [[breach of contract]] against Cloud Imperium Games.
