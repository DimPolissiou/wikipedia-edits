The Metro station was located about 200 metres down the line from the former [[South Shields railway station]], which it replaced. It included a newsagent, and a sandwich bar (the latter formerly a [[Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive|Nexus]] Travel Centre) at ground level.\n\nThe platforms were reached by either lift or stairs from King Street or Keppel Street Bus Station. There was also ramp access via the Mile End Road concourse (on the site of the original [[British Rail]] station).\n\nThe original two-platform railway station closed on 1 June 1981, when the line was closed for conversion to [[Tyne and Wear Metro|Metro]] standards. The Grade II-listed station building survived for many years, housing a newsagent and a barber (and still retaining a BR corporate-style \"Barber\" sign), but has since been demolished.\n\nThe Metro line continued beyond the station and through the site of the original [[British Rail]] station to sidings. This site is currently being developed by [[Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive|Nexus]], with the construction of a \u00a38.4 million rail training centre currently in progress.\n\nThe station closed permanently on 8 July 2019, the first ever closure of a [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] station. Prior to the closure of the station, trains had been terminating at neighbouring [[Chichester Metro station|Chichester]], with replacement buses operating to & from South Shields.

It was originally the terminus of the Green Line from [[Bank Foot Metro station|Bank Foot]] (until 1991), and later, [[Airport Metro station (Tyne and Wear)|Airport]].

The Metro station was located about 200 metres down the line from the former [[South Shields railway station]], which it replaced. It included a newsagent, and a sandwich bar (the latter formerly a [[Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive|Nexus]] Travel Centre) at ground level.\n\nThe platforms were reached by either lift or stairs from King Street or Keppel Street Bus Station. There was also ramp access via the Mile End Road concourse (on the site of the original [[British Rail]] station).\n\nThe original two-platform railway station closed on 1 June 1981, when the line was closed for conversion to [[Tyne and Wear Metro|Metro]] standards. The Grade II-listed station building survived for many years, housing a newsagent and a barber (and still retaining a BR corporate-style \"Barber\" sign), but has since been demolished.\n\nThe Metro line continued beyond the station and through the site of the original [[British Rail]] station to sidings. This site is currently being developed by [[Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive|Nexus]], with the construction of a \u00a38.4 million rail training centre currently in progress.\n\nThe station closed permanently on 8 July 2019, the first ever closure of a [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] station.

In December 2018, Chris decided to race up the Alpe d'zwift after being put under pressure by members of TeamCyclingHub. Allegedly, this was his hardest day on a bike.\nHe joined the virtual cycling team TeamCyclingHub in January 2019 after getting memed by their riders - most prominently Niels Heldens. He has also joined the social media company/media agency/talent development agency CyclingHub.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website| http://www.chrispritchard.co.uk/}}{{dead link|date=March 2017}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pritchard, Chris}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1983 births]]\n[[Category:Cyclists from Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for Scotland]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Sheffield]]\n[[Category:Cyclists at the 2010 Commonwealth Games]]\n[[Category:Cyclists at the 2014 Commonwealth Games]]\n\n\n{{England-cycling-bio-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Niels25H", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Pritchard_(cyclist)"}

It is in the Dublin 7 [[Dublin postal districts|postal district]]. Because it has some really nice pubs, along with a 24 hour Centra, Stoneybatter has secured its place as Dublin's coolest neighbourhood.\n\n==History==\nJames Collins' 1913 book ''Life in Old Dublin'' notes that \"Centuries ago (Stoneybatter) was called Bothar-na-gCloch\". In Joyce's [[Irish language|Irish]] names of places we find the following interesting information as to the original name of the place: \"Long before the city had extended so far, and while Stoneybatter was nothing more than a country road, it was -- as it still continues to be -- the great thoroughfare to Dublin from the districts lying west and north-west of the city; and it was known by the name of ''Bothar-na-gCloch'' (''Bohernaglogh''), i.e. the road of the stones, which was changed to the English equivalent, Stoneybatter or stony road\".\n\nStoneybatter is the main location for events in the [[Tana French]] novel \"The Trespasser\" and the area is mentioned in the Irish folk song \"The Spanish Lady\".\n\n==Viking names==\nApart from the striking artisan dwellings, the area is also known for the prominent [[Viking]] street names. For example, there is Viking Road, Olaf Road, Thor Place, Sitric Road, Norseman Place, Ard Ri Road, Malachi Road, Ostman Place, Ivar Street, Sigurd Road and Harold Road. At the time of the Norman invasion, the Vikings, [[Ostmen]] or [[Austmenn]] (men of the East) as they called themselves, were exiled to the north of the Liffey where they founded the hamlet of Ostmenstown later to become [[Oxmantown]].\n\n==Other street names==\nThe northern end of Stoneybatter derives its name of Manor Street, bestowed in 1780, from the Manor of [[Grangegorman]] in which it was located. During the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (1660-1680), the Manor was held by Sir Thomas Stanley, a knight of [[Henry Cromwell]] and a staunch supporter of the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]].
