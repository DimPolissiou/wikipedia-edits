Although the proposals were immediately laid before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] they were not brought forward by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] for approval. Accordingly, they did '''not''' come into effect for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]] on 12 December 2019, which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]], the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota. The review was carried out using the official UK electorate figures for 2015 and the electoral quota was set at 74,769, establishing a range of 71,031 to 78,507.

Although the proposals were immediately laid before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] they were not brought forward by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] for approval. Accordingly, they did '''not''' come into effect for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]] on 12 December 2019, which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]], the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota. The review was carried out using the official UK electorate figures for 2015 and the electoral quota was set at 74,769, establishing a range of 71,031 to 78,507.

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref> \n\n==Governance==\n{{Main|City of Brisbane|Logan City|Moreton Bay Region|City of Ipswich|Redland City|Scenic Rim Region|Government of Queensland}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Escudo de Brisbane.png\n| width1   = 120\n| caption1 = [[Coat of arms of Brisbane|City of Brisbane coat of arms]]\n| image2   = Flag of Brisbane.svg\n| width2   = 120\n| caption2 = [[Flag of Brisbane|City of Brisbane flag]]}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =[[Brisbane City Hall]] home to the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]], home of the [[Parliament of Queensland]]\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Brisbane Town Hall.jpg\n| width1   = 100\n| caption1 =\n| image2   = Christmas tree in 2019 at Parliament House, Brisbane, Queensland 03.jpg\n| width2   = 200\n| caption2 = }}\n\nUnlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]].

The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the [[Great Dividing Range]], with the [[Taylor Range|Taylor]] and [[D'Aguilar Range|D'Aguilar]] ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the [[Moreton Bay]] floodplain between the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine]] coasts, approximately from [[Caboolture]] in the north to [[Beenleigh]] in the south, and across to [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in the south west.\n\nThe Brisbane River is a wide [[tidal]] [[estuary]] and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are [[brackish]] and [[navigability|navigable]]. The river takes a winding course through the metropolitan area with many steep curves from the southwest to its mouth at [[Moreton Bay]] in the east. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the [[North Pine River|North Pine]] and [[South Pine River|South Pine]] rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the [[Pine River (Queensland)|Pine River]] estuary at [[Bramble Bay]], the [[Caboolture River]] further north, the [[Logan River|Logan]] and [[Albert River (Queensland)|Albert]] rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Brisbane River including the [[Bremer River (Queensland)|Bremer River]] in the south-western suburbs, [[Breakfast Creek]] in the inner-north, [[Norman Creek (Queensland)|Norman Creek]] in the inner-south, [[Oxley Creek]] in the south, [[Bulimba Creek]] in the inner south-east and [[Moggill Creek]] in the west.

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref> \n\n==Governance==\n{{Main|City of Brisbane|Logan City|Moreton Bay Region|City of Ipswich|Redland City|Scenic Rim Region|Government of Queensland}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Escudo de Brisbane.png\n| width1   = 120\n| caption1 = [[Coat of arms of Brisbane|City of Brisbane coat of arms]]\n| image2   = Flag of Brisbane.svg\n| width2   = 120\n| caption2 = [[Flag of Brisbane|City of Brisbane flag]]}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =[[Brisbane City Hall]] home to the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]], home of the [[Parliament of Queensland]]\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Brisbane Town Hall.jpg\n| width1   = 100\n| caption1 =\n| image2   = Christmas tree in 2019 at Parliament House, Brisbane, Queensland 03.jpg\n| width2   = 200\n| caption2 = }}\n\nUnlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]].

The high-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these assays but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.

For PoCT a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by skin puncture.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[File:80 foot motor yacht Alchemist photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|350px|The Lazzara 80-foot ''Alchemist'' on the California Coast]]\n[[Image:Jacht motorowy.JPG|thumb|Motor yacht at [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]] in Poland]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Superyacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]]. Depending on engine size, fuel costs may make motor yachts more expensive to operate than sailing yachts.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/design/understanding-hull-design|title=Understanding Hull Design|website=www.powerandmotoryacht.com}}</ref>\n\n===Hull designs===\nThe shape of a motor yacht's hull may be based on displacement, planing, or in between. Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century.

Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[File:80 foot motor yacht Alchemist photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|350px|The Lazzara 80-foot ''Alchemist'' on the California Coast]]\n[[Image:Jacht motorowy.JPG|thumb|Motor yacht at [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]] in Poland]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Superyacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]]. Depending on engine size, fuel costs may make motor yachts more expensive to operate than sailing yachts.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/design/understanding-hull-design|title=Understanding Hull Design|website=www.powerandmotoryacht.com}}</ref>\n\n===Hull designs===\nThe shape of a motor yacht's hull may be based on displacement, planing, or in between. Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

It is also popular in [[Atlantic Canada]], and [[Salt Lake City]], Utah.\n\nModern commercial taffy is made primarily from [[corn syrup]], [[glycerin]] and butter. The pulling process, which makes the candy lighter and chewier, consists of stretching out the mixture, folding it over and stretching it out again.  Although it is called \"salt water\" taffy, it does not include any [[seawater]] but does contain both salt and water in its manufacture.<ref name=recipe1>[http://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/candy/recipe-taffy.html recipe: Saltwater Taffy].

One relates to an assistant who substituted fresh water with sea water\u2014either through laziness or accident.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Another cites a storm which caused ocean water to wash over the candy, which was consequently (and successfully) marketed with the appropriate name.<ref name=\"wordpress.com\">{{cite web|url=https://ahg3rd.wordpress.com/joseph-f-fralinger-and-the-history-of-salt-water-taffy/|title=Joseph F.

Fralinger's first major competition came from candy maker Enoch James, who refined the recipe, making it less sticky and easier to unwrap. James also cut the candy into bite-sized pieces, and is credited with mechanizing the \"pulling\" process.
