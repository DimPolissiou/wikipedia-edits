It is located at 1600 [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and has been the residence of every U.S. president since [[John Adams]] in 1800. The term \"White House\" is often used as a [[metonym]] for the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|president and his advisers]].\n\nThe residence was designed by Irish-born architect [[James Hoban]]{{r|TSGjH}} in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. Hoban modelled the building on [[Leinster House]] in [[Dublin]], a building which today houses the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish legislature. Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using [[Aquia Creek sandstone]] painted white. When [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]]) added low [[colonnade]]s on each wing that concealed stables and storage.{{r|bwDpG}}  In 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the mansion was set ablaze by the [[British Army]] in the [[Burning of Washington]], destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President [[James Monroe]] moved into the partially reconstructed [[Executive Residence]] in October 1817. Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829.\n\nBecause of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed [[West Wing]] in 1901. Eight years later in 1909, President [[William Howard Taft]] expanded the West Wing and created the first [[Oval Office]], which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor [[attic]] was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing [[hip roof]] with long shed dormers. A newly constructed [[East Wing]] was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the residence's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under [[Harry S. Truman]], the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing [[steel frame]] constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.\n\nThe modern-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building]]\u2014the former State Department, which now houses offices for the president's staff and the vice president\u2014and [[Blair House]], a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six stories\u2014the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story [[White House basement|basement]]. The property is a [[National Heritage Site (United States)|National Heritage Site]] owned by the [[National Park Service]] and is part of the [[President's Park]]. In 2007, it was ranked second{{r|1AvjX}} on the [[American Institute of Architects]] list of \"[[America's Favorite Architecture]]\".\n\n==Early history==\n\n===1789\u20131800===\n{{further|Presidency of George Washington#Residences}}\nFollowing his April 1789 inauguration, President [[George Washington]] occupied two private houses in New York City as the executive mansion. He lived at the first, known as the [[Samuel Osgood House|Franklin House]] and owned by Treasury Commissioner [[Samuel Osgood]], at 3 Cherry Street through late February 1790.{{r|Baker1897}}{{r|mvorg}}  The executive mansion moved to the larger quarters of the [[Alexander Macomb House]] at 39\u201341 Broadway{{r|mvorg}} where he stayed, with his wife and a small staff until August 1790. In May 1790, New York began construction of a \"proper\" house for the presidential mansion, [[Government House (New York City)|Government House]].{{r|Stokes}} Washington never used the mansion because it was not completed until after the national capital was moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], in December 1790.{{r|Stokes}}\n\nThe July 1790 [[Residence Act]] designated the capital be permanently located in the new [[Washington, D.C.|Federal District]], and temporarily in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], for ten years while the permanent capital was built.{{r|6ylva}} Philadelphia rented the mansion of the wealthy merchant [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] at 190 High Street (now 524\u201330 Market Street) as the [[President's House (Philadelphia)|President's House]], which Washington occupied from November 1790 to March 1797.{{r|ushist}}  Since the house was too small to accommodate the thirty people that made up the presidential family, staff, and servants, Washington had it enlarged.{{r|ushist}} \n\nPresident [[John Adams]] also occupied the High Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On Saturday, November 1, 1800, he became the first president to occupy the White House.{{r|jK8YA}}\n\nThe President's House in Philadelphia was converted into the Union Hotel, and later used for stores, before being demolished in 1832.{{r|ushist}}\n\nPhiladelphia began construction of a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away in 1792. It was nearly completed by the time of Adam's 1797 inauguration. However, Adams declined to occupy it saying he did not have Congressional authorization to lease the building. It remained vacant until it was sold to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1800.{{r|Westcott1894}}\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=100px>\nFile:The First Presidential Mansion.jpg|First Presidential Mansion: [[Samuel Osgood House]], Manhattan, New York.

However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the U.S., [[Jean Jules Jusserand]], popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, \"Pierre Charles L'Enfant\". (Reference: Bowling, Kenneth R (2002). ''Peter Charles L'Enfant: vision, honor, and male friendship in the early American Republic.'' George Washington University, Washington, D.C. {{ISBN|978-0-9727611-0-9}}). The [[United States Code]] states in {{USC|40|3309}}: \"(a) In General.\u2014The purposes of this chapter shall be carried out in the District of Columbia as nearly as may be practicable in harmony with the plan of Peter Charles L'Enfant.\" The [[National Park Service]] identifies L'Enfant as \"[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/text.htm#washington Major Peter Charles L'Enfant]\" and as \"[https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/presidents/washington_monument.html Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]\" on its website.}} 1791 [[L'Enfant Plan|plan]] for the newly established federal city, Washington, D.C.{{r|IYuWd}} Washington and his Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]], who both had personal interests in architecture, agreed that the design of the White House, and the Capital, would be chosen in a [[Architectural design competition|design competition]].{{r|Frary}}\n\nAlthough all proposals for the Capital were rejected, an acceptable drawing for the White House submitted by [[James Hoban]] was selected from several including one submitted anonymously by Jefferson himself.{{r|np7Jl}}\n\nHoban was born in Ireland and trained at the [[Dublin Society of Arts]]. He emigrated to the US after the revolution, first seeking work in Philadelphia and later finding success in [[South Carolina]] where he designed several buildings including the state capitol at [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]. Hoban ultimately supervised the construction of both the US Capitol and the White House.{{r|u1v6F}}\n\nPresident Washington visited [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in May 1791 on his \"Southern Tour\", and saw the under-construction [[Charleston County Courthouse]] designed by Hoban. He is reputed to have met with Hoban then. The following year, he summoned the architect to Philadelphia and met with him in June 1792.{{r|eYnQA}}\n\nOn July 16, 1792, the president met with the commissioners of the federal city to make his judgment in the architectural competition. His review is recorded as being brief, and he quickly selected Hoban's submission.{{r|nUHxy}}\n\n===Design influences===\nThe building has classical inspiration sources, that could be found directly or indirectly in the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] or in [[Andrea Palladio]] styles; Palladio being an Italian architect of the [[Renaissance]] which had a considerable influence on the Western architecture ([[Palladian architecture]]). The building Hoban designed is verifiably influenced by the upper floors of [[Leinster House]], in [[Dublin]], which later became the seat of the [[Oireachtas]] (the Irish parliament).{{r|Ywh2c}} Several other Georgian-era Irish country houses have been suggested as sources of inspiration for the overall floor plan, details like the bow-fronted south front, and interior details like the former niches in the present [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. These influences, though undocumented, are cited in the official White House guide, and in [[White House Historical Association]] publications. The first official White House guide, published in 1962, suggested a link between Hoban's design for the South Portico and [[Ch\u00e2teau de Rastignac]], a neoclassical country house located in [[La Bachellerie]] in the [[Dordogne]] region of France and designed by Mathurin Salat. Construction on the French house was initially started before 1789, interrupted by the [[French Revolution]] for twenty years and then finally built 1812\u20131817 (based on Salat's pre-1789 design).{{r|France?}} The theoretical link between the two houses has been criticized because Hoban did not visit France. Supporters of a connection posit that [[Thomas Jefferson]], during his tour of [[Bordeaux]] in 1789, viewed Salat's architectural drawings (which were on-file at the College) at the [[\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale d'Architecture]] (Bordeaux Architectural College).{{r|johnson}}  On his return to the U.S. he then shared the influence with Washington, Hoban, Monroe, and [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]].{{r|France?}}\n\n===Construction===\n\nConstruction of the White House began with the laying of the cornerstone on October 13, 1792, although there was no formal ceremony.{{r|yLpeA}} The main residence, as well as foundations of the house, were built largely by [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] and free [[African-American]] laborers, as well as employed Europeans.{{r|mJ52j}} Much of the other work on the house was performed by immigrants, many not yet with citizenship. The sandstone walls were erected by [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrants, employed by Hoban,{{r|whha overview}} as were the high-relief rose and garland decorations above the north entrance and the \"fish scale\" pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods. There are conflicting claims as to where the sandstone used in the construction of the White House originated. Some reports suggest sandstone from the [[Croatia]]n island of [[Bra\u010d]] (specifically the [[Pu\u010di\u0161\u0107a]] querry whose stone was used to build the ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Diocletian's Palace|palace]] of [[Diocletian|Emperor Diocletian]]) was used in the original construction of the building, contrarily researchers believe limestone from the island was used in the 1902 renovations and not the original construction. Others suggest the original sandstone simply came from [[Aquia Creek]] in [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]], [[Virginia]], as importing the stone would be too costly.{{r|zQgqd}}{{r|L0Ydi}}{{r|J1ZuL}} The initial construction took place over a period of eight years, at a reported cost of $232,371.83 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|232371.83|1800}}}} today). Although not yet completed, the White House was ready for occupancy circa November 1, 1800.{{r|XEjY4}}\n\nShortages, including material and labor, forced alterations to the earlier plan developed by French engineer [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] for a \"palace\" that was five times larger than the house that was eventually built.{{r|whha overview}} The finished structure contained only two main floors instead of the planned three, and a less costly brick served as a lining for the stone fa\u00e7ades. When construction was finished, the porous sandstone walls were [[whitewash]]ed with a mixture of lime, rice glue, casein, and lead, giving the house its familiar color and name.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nSeveral [[replicas of the White House]] have been constructed.\n\n===Architectural description===\n\nThe north front is the principal fa\u00e7ade of the White House and consists of three floors and eleven bays. The ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and [[parapet]], thus the fa\u00e7ade appears to be of two floors. The central three bays are behind a [[Prostyle|prostyle portico]] (this was a later addition to the house, built circa 1830) serving, thanks to the carriage ramp, as a [[porte cochere]]. The windows of the four bays flanking the portico, at first-floor level, have alternating pointed and segmented [[pediment]]s, while at second-floor level the pediments are flat. The principal entrance at the center of the portico is surmounted by a [[lunette]] [[fanlight]]. Above the entrance is a sculpted floral [[festoon]]. The roofline is hidden by a balustraded [[parapet]].\n\nThe mansion's southern fa\u00e7ade is a combination of the [[Palladian]] and neoclassical styles of architecture. It is of three floors, all visible. The ground floor is [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] in the Palladian fashion. At the center of the fa\u00e7ade is a neoclassical projecting bow of three bays. The bow is flanked by five bays, the windows of which, as on the north fa\u00e7ade, have alternating segmented and pointed pediments at first-floor level. The bow has a ground floor [[double staircase]] leading to an [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[colonnade]]d [[loggia]] (with the [[Truman Balcony]] at second-floor level), known as the south portico. The more modern third floor is hidden by a balustraded parapet and plays no part in the composition of the fa\u00e7ade.\n\n===Naming conventions===\n\nThe building was originally variously referred to as the \"President's Palace\", \"Presidential Mansion\", or \"President's House\".{{r|xVvhI}} The earliest evidence of the public calling it the \"White House\" was recorded in 1811.{{r|8Rmlj}} A myth emerged that during the rebuilding of the structure after the [[Burning of Washington]], white paint was applied to mask the burn damage it had suffered,{{r|A3bMb}} giving the building its namesake hue.{{r|EdqBf}} The name \"Executive Mansion\" was used in official contexts until President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established the formal name by having \"White House\u2013Washington\" engraved on the stationery in 1901.{{r|Qtiju}}{{r|WH facts}} The current letterhead wording and arrangement \"The White House\" with the word \"Washington\" centered beneath goes back to the administration of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].{{r|WH facts}}\n\nAlthough the structure was not completed until some years after the presidency of George Washington, there is speculation that the name of the traditional residence of the president of the United States may have derived from [[Martha Washington]]'s home, [[White House (plantation)|White House Plantation]] in Virginia, where the nation's first president had courted the first lady in the mid-18th century.{{r|D7o2v}}\n\n==Evolution of the White House==\n\n===Early use, the 1814 fire, and rebuilding===\n\nOn Saturday, November 1, 1800, [[John Adams]] became the first president to take residence in the building.{{r|whha overview}} The next day he wrote his wife Abigail:\n\"I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.\"{{r|whha state dining room}} \nFranklin D. Roosevelt had Adams's blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room.{{r|whha state dining room}}\n\nAdams lived in the house only briefly before [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the \"pleasant country residence\"{{r|NRJJd}} in 1801. Despite his complaints that the house was too big (\"big enough for two emperors, one pope, and the grand lama in the bargain\"{{r|sacjA}}), Jefferson considered how the White House might be added to. With [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], he helped lay out the design for the East and West Colonnades, small wings that help conceal the domestic operations of laundry, a stable and storage.{{r|whha overview}} Today, Jefferson's colonnades link the residence with the East and West Wings.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nIn 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the White House was set ablaze by British troops{{r|whha east room}} during the [[Burning of Washington]], in retaliation for burning of [[Port Dover]] and other towns in [[Upper Canada]]; much of Washington was affected by these fires as well. Only the exterior walls remained, and they had to be torn down and mostly reconstructed because of weakening from the fire and subsequent exposure to the elements, except for portions of the south wall. Of the numerous objects taken from the White House when it was ransacked by British troops, only two have been recovered. Employees and slaves rescued a painting of George Washington,{{r|whha east room}} and in 1939, a Canadian man returned a jewelry box to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], claiming that his grandfather had taken it from Washington. Some observers allege that most of these spoils were lost when a convoy of British ships led by [[HMS Fantome (1810)|HMS ''Fantome'']] sank en route to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] off [[Prospect, Nova Scotia|Prospect]] during a storm on the night of November 24, 1814,{{r|K9M68}}{{r|iDYQ3}} even though ''Fantome'' had no involvement in that action.{{r|2ZhT4}}\n\nAfter the fire, President [[James Madison]] resided in [[The Octagon House (Washington, D.C.)|the Octagon House]] from 1814 to 1815, and then the [[Seven Buildings]] from 1815 to the end of his term.{{r|KQzqy}} Meanwhile, both architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe and Hoban contributed to the design and oversight of the reconstruction, which lasted from 1815 until 1817. The south [[portico]] was constructed in 1824 during the [[James Monroe]] administration; the north portico was built six years later.{{r|whha overview}} Though Latrobe proposed similar porticos before the fire in 1814, both porticos were built as designed by Hoban.{{r|tbe3z}} An elliptical portico at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Rastignac]] in La Bachellerie, France with nearly identical curved stairs is speculated as the source of inspiration due to its similarity with the South Portico,{{r|wh museum 1825-1872}} although this matter is one of great debate.{{r|wSPdx}} Italian artisans, brought to Washington to help in constructing the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]], carved the decorative stonework on both porticos. Contrary to speculation, the North Portico was not modeled on a similar portico on another Dublin building, the [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in|Viceregal Lodge]] (now ''\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in'', residence of the [[President of Ireland]]), for its portico postdates the White House porticos' design.{{r|wh museum 1825-1872}} For the North Portico, a variation on the [[Ionic Order]] was devised incorporating a swag of roses between the volutes. This was done to link the new portico with the earlier carved roses above the entrance.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:The President's House by George Munger, 1814-1815 - Crop.jpg|The White House as it looked following the fire of August 24, 1814\nFile:White-House.jpg|[[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Latrobe]]'s West Wing Colonnade, in this nineteenth-century engraved view, is now the [[James S.

The location of the White House was questioned, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for [[malaria]] and other unhealthy conditions.{{r|epstein}} Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler was tasked to propose solutions to address these concerns. He proposed abandoning the use of the White House as a residence and designed a new estate for the first family at [[Meridian Hill Park|Meridian Hill]] in Washington, D.C., but Congress rejected the plan.{{r|epstein}} Another site under consideration was Metropolis View, today the campus of [[The Catholic University of America]].{{r|MqIIY}}\n\n[[File:WhiteHouseProposedAddition.jpg|thumb|right|Additions proposed by architect Frederick D. Owen (1901).]]\n[[File:1860s White House.jpg|thumb|right|The [[North Lawn (White House)|North Lawn]] during the [[Abraham Lincoln]] administration]]\n\nWhen [[Chester A. Arthur]] took office in 1881, he ordered renovations to the White House to take place as soon as the recently widowed [[Lucretia Garfield]] moved out. Arthur inspected the work almost nightly and made several suggestions. [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] was asked to send selected designers to assist. Over twenty wagonloads of furniture and household items were removed from the building and sold at a [[public auction]].{{r|reeves268}} All that was saved were bust portraits of [[John Adams]] and [[Martin Van Buren]].{{r|reevesn473}} A proposal was made to build a new residence south of the White House, but it failed to gain support.\n\nIn the fall of 1882 work was done on the main corridor, including tinting the walls pale olive and adding squares of [[gold leaf]], and decorating the ceiling in gold and silver, and colorful [[Tracery|traceries]] woven to spell \"USA\". The Red Room was painted a dull Pomeranian red, and its ceiling was decorated with gold, silver, and copper stars and stripes of red, white, and blue. A fifty-foot jeweled [[Tiffany glass|Tiffany]] glass screen, supported by imitation marble columns, replaced the glass doors that separated the main corridor from the north vestibule.{{r|reeves269}}{{r|bFjvZ}}\n\nIn 1891, First Lady [[Caroline Harrison]] proposed major extensions to the White House, including a National Wing on the east for a historical art gallery, and a wing on the west for official functions.{{r|epstein}} A plan was devised by Colonel Theodore A. Bingham, which reflected the Harrison proposal.{{r|epstein}} These plans were ultimately rejected.\n\nHowever, in 1902 [[Theodore Roosevelt]] hired [[McKim, Mead & White]] to carry out expansions and renovations in a neoclassical style suited to the building's architecture, removing the Tiffany screen and all Victorian additions.{{r|Yl4bH}}{{r|R6fqD}}  [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles McKim]] himself designed and managed the project, which gave more living space to the president's large family by removing a staircase in the West Hall and moving executive office staff from the second floor of the residence into the new West Wing.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nPresident [[William Howard Taft]] enlisted the help of architect [[Nathan C. Wyeth]] to add additional space to the West Wing, which included the addition of the [[Oval Office]].{{r|epstein}}  In 1925, Congress enacted legislation allowing the White House to accept gifts of furniture and art for the first time.{{r|AbbottRice|p=17}} The West Wing was damaged by fire on Christmas Eve 1929; [[Herbert Hoover]] and his aides moved back into it on April 14, 1930.{{r|oeGVZ}} \nIn the 1930s, a second story was added, as well as a larger basement for White House staff, and President Franklin Roosevelt had the Oval Office moved to its present location: adjacent to the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]].{{r|whha overview}}\n\n===Truman reconstruction===\n{{main|White House Reconstruction}}\n[[File:The Shell of the White House during the Renovation-05-17-1950.jpg|thumb|[[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] reconstruction, 1949\u20131952, a steel structure is built within the exterior shell]]\n\nDecades of poor maintenance, the construction of a fourth story attic during the Coolidge administration, and the addition of a second-floor balcony over the south portico for [[Harry S. Truman]]{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} took a great toll on the brick and sandstone structure built around a timber frame.{{r|whha overview}} By 1948, the house was declared to be in imminent danger of collapse, forcing President Truman to commission a reconstruction and to live across the street at [[Blair House]] from 1949 to 1951.{{r|OA7bu}} The work, done by the firm of [[Philadelphia]] contractor [[John McShain]], required the complete dismantling of the interior spaces, construction of a new load-bearing internal steel frame and the reconstruction of the original rooms within the new structure.{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} The total cost of the renovations was about $5.7 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5.7|1951|r=0}}}} million in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{r|vm2mG}} Some modifications to the floor plan were made, the largest being the repositioning of the grand staircase to open into the Entrance Hall, rather than the Cross Hall.{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} Central air conditioning was added, as well as two additional sub-basements providing space for workrooms, storage, and a bomb shelter.{{r|whha overview}} The Trumans moved back into the White House on March 27, 1952.{{r|whha overview}} While the house's structure was kept intact by the Truman reconstruction, much of the new interior finishes were generic, and of little historic value. Much of the original plasterwork, some dating back to the 1814\u20131816 rebuilding, was too damaged to reinstall, as was the original robust Beaux Arts paneling in the East Room. President Truman had the original timber frame sawn into paneling; the walls of the [[Vermeil Room]], [[Library (White House)|Library]], [[China Room]], and [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]] on the ground floor of the main residence were paneled in wood from the timbers.{{r|UtzOl}}\n\n===Jacqueline Kennedy restoration===\n[[File:BoudinRedRoom.jpg|thumb|The [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]] as designed by [[St\u00e9phane Boudin]] during the presidency of John F.

She enlisted the help of [[Henry Francis du Pont]] of the [[Winterthur Museum]] to assist in collecting artifacts for the mansion, many of which had once been housed there.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} Other antiques, fine paintings, and improvements of the Kennedy period were donated to the White House by wealthy philanthropists, including the [[Crowninshield family]], [[Jane Engelhard]], [[Jayne Wrightsman]], and the Oppenheimer family.\n\n[[St\u00e9phane Boudin]] of the [[Maison Jansen|House of Jansen]], a Paris interior-design firm that had been recognized worldwide, was employed by Jacqueline Kennedy to assist with the decoration.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} Different periods of the early republic and world history were selected as a theme for each room: the Federal style for the [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]], French Empire for the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]], American Empire for the [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], Louis XVI for the [[Yellow Oval Room]], and Victorian for the president's study, renamed the [[Treaty Room]]. Antique furniture was acquired, and decorative fabric and trim based on period documents was produced and installed. The Kennedy restoration resulted in a more authentic White House of grander stature, which recalled the French taste of Madison and Monroe.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} In the [[Diplomatic Reception Room (White House)|Diplomatic Reception Room]], Mrs. Kennedy installed an antique \"Vue de l'Am\u00e9rique Nord\" wallpaper which [[Zuber & Cie]] had designed in 1834. The wallpaper had hung previously on the walls of another mansion until 1961 when that house was demolished for a grocery store. Just before the demolition, the wallpaper was salvaged and sold to the White House.\n\nThe first White House guidebook was produced under the direction of curator Lorraine Waxman Pearce with direct supervision from Mrs. Kennedy.{{r|OLizx}} Sale of the guidebook helped finance the restoration.\n\nKennedy showed her restoration of the White House to the public in [[A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F.

Furniture, fixtures, and decorative arts could now be declared either historic or of artistic interest by the president. This prevented them from being sold (as many objects in the executive mansion had been in the past 150 years). When not in use or display at the White House, these items were to be turned over to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for preservation, study, storage, or exhibition. The White House retains the right to have these items returned.{{r|AbbottRice|p=29}}\n\nOut of respect for the historic character of the White House, no substantive architectural changes have been made to the house since the Truman renovation.{{r|YsEpb}} Since the Kennedy restoration, every presidential family has made some changes to the private quarters of the White House, but the [[Committee for the Preservation of the White House]] must approve any modifications to the State Rooms. Charged with maintaining the historical integrity of the White House, the congressionally authorized committee works with each First Family\u2014usually represented by the first lady, the [[White House Office of the Curator|White House curator]], and the [[White House Chief Usher|chief usher]]\u2014to implement the family's proposals for altering the house.{{r|nJVBo}}\n\nDuring the Nixon Administration (1969\u20131974), First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] refurbished the Green Room, Blue Room, and Red Room, working with Clement Conger, the curator appointed by President [[Richard Nixon]].{{r|t2zEz}} Mrs. Nixon's efforts brought more than 600 artifacts to the house, the largest acquisition by any administration.{{r|MF74M}} Her husband created the modern press briefing room over [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s old swimming pool.{{r|press room}} Nixon also added a single-lane bowling alley to the White House basement.{{r|gMser}}\n\nComputers and the first laser printer were added during the Carter administration, and the use of computer technology was expanded during the Reagan administration.{{r|gff8t}} A Carter-era innovation, a set of [[solar heating|solar water heating panels]] that were mounted on the roof of the White House, was removed during Reagan's presidency.{{r|wq6cM}}{{r|Burdick}} Redecorations were made to the private family quarters and maintenance was made to public areas during the Reagan years.{{r|da1980}} The house was accredited as a museum in 1988.{{r|da1980}}\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] refurbished some rooms with the assistance of [[Arkansas]] decorator Kaki Hockersmith, including the Oval Office, the East Room, Blue Room, [[State Dining Room of the White House|State Dining Room]], Lincoln Bedroom, and Lincoln Sitting Room.{{r|wh makeover}} During the administration of [[George W.

Roosevelt]], who used a wheelchair because of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|his paralytic illness]]. In the 1990s, [[Hillary Clinton]], at the suggestion of Visitors Office Director Melinda N. Bates, approved the addition of a ramp in the East Wing corridor. It allowed easy [[wheelchair]] access for the public tours and special events that enter through the secure entrance building on the east side.\n\nIn 2003, the Bush administration reinstalled solar thermal heaters.{{r|Burdick}} These units are used to heat water for landscape maintenance personnel and for the presidential pool and spa. 167 solar photovoltaic grid-tied panels were installed at the same time on the roof of the maintenance facility. The changes were not publicized as a White House spokeswoman said the changes were an internal matter. The story was picked up by industry trade journals.{{r|FCAxL}} In 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] had a set of [[solar panel]]s installed on the roof of the White House, making it the first time solar power would be used for the president's living quarters.{{r|ztiyM}}{{r|BA0aA}}\n\n===Layout and amenities===\n\nToday the group of buildings housing the presidency is known as the White House Complex. It includes the central [[Executive Residence]] flanked by the [[East Wing]] and [[West Wing]]. The [[White House Chief Usher|Chief Usher]] coordinates day to day household operations. The White House includes: six stories and 55,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup> (5,100 m<sup>2</sup>) of floor space, 132 rooms and 35 bathrooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, twenty-eight fireplaces, eight staircases, three elevators, five full-time chefs, a tennis court, a (single-lane) bowling alley, a movie theater (officially called the [[White House Family Theater]]{{r|JDYhZ}}), a jogging track, a swimming pool, and a putting green.{{r|WH facts}} It receives up to 30,000 visitors each week.{{r|bumiller200901}}\n{{multiple image\n | align =center\n | direction =horizontal\n | perrow = 3\n | image1 = White House and grounds.png\n | width1 = 68\n | caption1 = Layout of entire site\n | image2 = WHComplex.svg\n | width2 = 300\n | caption2 = White House Complex\n | image3 = White House West Wing FloorPlan1.svg\n | width3 = 168\n | caption3 = [[West Wing]]\n | image4 = WHground.svg\n | width4 = 150\n | caption4 = Ground floor\n | image5 = White House State Floor.svg\n | width5 = 153\n | caption5 = State floor\n | image6 = White House FloorPlan2.svg\n | width6 = 150\n | caption6 = Second floor (residence)\n}}\n\n===Executive Residence===\n{{Main|Executive Residence}}\n\nThe original residence is in the center. Two [[colonnade]]s\u2014one on the east and one on the west\u2014designed by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings added later. The [[Executive Residence]] houses the president's dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining. The State Floor of the residence building includes the [[East Room]], [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]], [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]], [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], [[State Dining Room]], [[Family Dining Room]], [[Cross Hall]], [[Entrance Hall]], and [[Grand Staircase (White House)|Grand Staircase]].{{r|OwkS5}} The Ground Floor is made up of the [[Diplomatic Reception Room]], [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]], [[China Room]], [[Vermeil Room]], [[White House Library|Library]], the main kitchen, and other offices.{{r|8vyYA}} The second floor family residence includes the [[Yellow Oval Room]], [[East Sitting Hall|East]] and [[West Sitting Hall]]s, the White House Master Bedroom, [[President's Dining Room]], the [[Treaty Room]], [[Lincoln Bedroom]] and [[Queens' Bedroom]], as well as two additional bedrooms, a smaller kitchen, and a private dressing room.{{r|S4zYx}} The third floor consists of the White House Solarium, Game Room, Linen Room, a Diet Kitchen, and another sitting room (previously used as President George W.

It also includes the [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]], where the president conducts business meetings and where the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meets,{{r|kzExn}} as well as the [[White House Situation Room]], [[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room]], and [[Roosevelt Room]].{{r|cQOP2}} In 2007, work was completed on renovations of the press briefing room, adding [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] cables and [[LCD]] screens for the display of charts and graphs.{{r|press room2}} The makeover took 11 months and cost of $8 million, out of which news outlets paid $2 million.{{r|press room2}} In September 2010, [[White House Big Dig|a two-year project]] began on the West Wing, creating a multistory underground structure.{{r|vyYFd}}\n\nSome members of the President's staff are located in the adjacent [[Old Executive Office Building]], formerly the State War and Navy building, and sometimes known as the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.{{r|press room2}}\n\nThe Oval Office, Roosevelt Room, and other portions of the West Wing were partially replicated on a [[sound stage]] and used as the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] for the popular television show ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]''.{{r|wKroZ}}\n\n===East Wing===\n{{Main|East Wing}}\n\nThe East Wing, which contains additional office space, was added to the White House in 1942. Among its uses, the East Wing has intermittently housed the offices and staff of the [[First Lady of the United States|first lady]], and the White House Social Office. [[Rosalynn Carter]], in 1977, was the first to place her personal office in the East Wing and to formally call it the \"Office of the First Lady\". The East Wing was built during [[World War II]] in order to hide the construction of an underground bunker to be used in emergencies. The bunker has come to be known as the [[Presidential Emergency Operations Center]].\n\n===Grounds===\nThe White House and grounds cover just over 18 acres (about 7.3 hectares). Before the construction of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the [[South Lawn (White House)|South Lawn]], which was graded and planted by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the [[North Lawn (White House)|North Lawn]] that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger [[greenhouse]]s were built on the west side of the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds. The general layout of the White House grounds today is based on the 1935 design by [[Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.]] of the [[Olmsted Brothers]] firm, commissioned by  President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the Kennedy administration, the [[White House Rose Garden]] was redesigned by [[Rachel Lambert Mellon]]. The Rose Garden borders the West Colonnade. Bordering the East Colonnade is the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Garden]], which was begun by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] but completed after her husband's assassination. On the weekend of June 23, 2006, a century-old [[American Elm|American Elm (''Ulmus americana'' L.)]] tree on the north side of the building came down during one of the many storms amid [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006|intense flooding]]. Among the oldest trees on the grounds are several magnolias (''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'') planted by Andrew Jackson, including the Jackson Magnolia, reportedly grown from a sprout taken from the favorite tree of Jackson's recently deceased wife, the sprout planted after Jackson moved into the White House. The tree stood for over 200 years; but in 2017, having become too weak to stand on its own, it was decided it should be removed and replaced with one of its offspring.{{r|CcD01}}{{r|KpnOF}} Michelle Obama planted the White House's first organic garden and installed beehives on the South Lawn of the White House, which will supply organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.{{r|U4C8Y}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:White-house-floor1-cross-Hall.jpg|The [[Cross Hall]], connecting the [[State Dining Room]] and the [[East Room]] on the State Floor\nFile:WhSouthLawn.JPEG|[[Marine One]] prepares to land on the South Lawn, where [[State Arrival Ceremony|State Arrival Ceremonies]] are held.\nFile:White House, Blue Sky.jpg|View from the south, with fountain\nFile:1122-WAS-The White House.JPG|View from the north\nFile:The White House at night, 2011.jpg|White House at night, view from the north\n</gallery>\n\n==Public access and security==\n{{See also|White House Visitors Office|List of White House security breaches}}\n\n===Historical accessibility===\nLike the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] followed him home, where he greeted them in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President [[Andrew Jackson]] had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected [[Grover Cleveland]] arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President [[Bill Clinton]] briefly revived the New Year's Day open house in his first term.\n\nThe White House remained accessible in other ways; President [[Abraham Lincoln]] complained that he was constantly beleaguered by job seekers waiting to ask him for political appointments or other favors, or eccentric dispensers of advice like \"General\" [[Daniel Pratt (eccentric)|Daniel Pratt]], as he began the business day. Lincoln put up with the annoyance rather than risk alienating some associate or friend of a powerful politician or opinion maker.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Aviation incidents===\n{{Update|section|date=April 2015}}<!-- April 15, 2015 incident; possibly January 2015 if drones count -->\nIn February 1974, a stolen army helicopter [[1974 White House helicopter incident|landed without authorization]] on the White House's grounds.{{r|bXgDO}} Twenty years later, in 1994, a light plane flown by [[Frank Eugene Corder]] crashed on the White House grounds, and he died instantly.{{r|JO4kZ}}\n\nAs a result of increased security regarding air traffic in the capital, the White House was evacuated in May 2005 before an unauthorized aircraft could approach the grounds.{{r|ZScbt}}\n\n===Closure of Pennsylvania Avenue===\n[[File:U.S. Secret Service Agent.jpg|left|thumb|A uniformed U.S. Secret Service Agent on Pennsylvania Avenue.]]\nOn May 20, 1995, primarily as a response to the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] of April 19, 1995, the [[United States Secret Service]] closed off Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White House from the eastern edge of Lafayette Park to 17th Street. Later, the closure was extended an additional block to the east to 15th Street, and East Executive Avenue, a small street between the White House and the [[Treasury Building (Washington, D.C.)|Treasury Building]].\n\nAfter [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], this change was made permanent in addition to closing E Street between the South Portico of the White House and [[the Ellipse]].{{r|VuiCP}} In response to the [[Boston Marathon bombing]], the road was closed to the public in its entirety for a period of two days.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Avenue closing has been opposed by organized civic groups in Washington, D.C. They argue that the closing impedes traffic flow unnecessarily and is inconsistent with the well-conceived historic plan for the city. As for security considerations, they note that the White House is set much farther back from the street than numerous other sensitive federal buildings are.{{r|F17OZ}}\n\nPrior to its inclusion within the fenced compound that now includes the [[Old Executive Office Building]] to the west and the Treasury Building to the east, this sidewalk served as a queuing area for the daily public tours of the White House. These tours were suspended in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. In September 2003, they resumed on a limited basis for groups making prior arrangements through their Congressional representatives or embassies in Washington for foreign nationals and submitting to background checks, but the White House remained closed to the public.{{r|6Dutd}} White House tours were suspended for most of 2013 due to budget constraints after [[Budget sequestration in 2013|sequestration]].{{r|1xVao}} The White House reopened to the public in November 2013.{{r|msl6S}}\n\n===Protection===\nThe White House Complex is protected by the [[United States Secret Service]] and the [[United States Park Police]].\n\n[[NASAMS]] (Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System) were used to guard air space over Washington, D.C. during the 2005 presidential inauguration. The same NASAMS units have since been used to protect the president and all airspace around the White House, which is strictly prohibited to aircraft.{{r|2YCbp}}{{r|D55GA}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:PennAveWhiteHouse.jpg|For security reasons, the section of Pennsylvania Avenue on the north side of the White House is closed to all vehicular traffic, except government officials.\nFile:US $20 Series 2006 Reverse.jpg|North front of the White House on the reverse (back) of the [[United States twenty-dollar bill|U.S. $20 bill]].\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Pedro Casanave]]\n* [[Camp David]]\n* [[Germantown White House]]\n* [[Graphics and Calligraphy Office]]\n* [[List of largest houses in the United States]]\n* [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Washington, D.C.]]\n* [[List of residences of Presidents of the United States]]\n* [[List of residences of Presidents of the United States#Western White House]]\n* [[Number One Observatory Circle]], residence of the Vice President\n* [[Reportedly haunted locations in the District of Columbia#White House|Reported White House ghosts]]\n* [[:Category:Rooms in the White House]]\n* [[White House Acquisition Trust]]\n* [[White House Chief Calligrapher]]\n* [[White House Chief Floral Designer]]\n* [[White House Christmas tree]]\n* [[White House Communications Agency]]\n* [[White House Endowment Trust]]\n* [[White House Executive Chef]]\n* [[White House Fellows]]\n* ''[[White House History]]''\n* [[White House Social Secretary]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2013a}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Baker1897\">{{cite book|last=Baker|first=William Spohn|title=Washington After the Revolution: 1784-1799|url=https://archive.org/details/washingtonafter00bakegoog|accessdate=January 15, 2020|year=1897|page=[https://archive.org/details/washingtonafter00bakegoog/page/n125 118]}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mvorg\">{{cite web |title=Presidential Residency in New York |url=https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/presidential-residency-in-new-york/ |website=mountvernon.org |publisher=The Fred W.

It is located at 1600 [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and has been the residence of every U.S. president since [[John Adams]] in 1800. The term \"White House\" is often used as a [[metonym]] for the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|president and his advisers]].\n\nThe residence was designed by Irish-born architect [[James Hoban]]{{r|TSGjH}} in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. Hoban modelled the building on [[Leinster House]] in [[Dublin]], a building which today houses the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish legislature. Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using [[Aquia Creek sandstone]] painted white. When [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]]) added low [[colonnade]]s on each wing that concealed stables and storage.{{r|bwDpG}}  In 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the mansion was set ablaze by the [[British Army]] in the [[Burning of Washington]], destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President [[James Monroe]] moved into the partially reconstructed [[Executive Residence]] in October 1817. Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829.\n\nBecause of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed [[West Wing]] in 1901. Eight years later in 1909, President [[William Howard Taft]] expanded the West Wing and created the first [[Oval Office]], which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor [[attic]] was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing [[hip roof]] with long shed dormers. A newly constructed [[East Wing]] was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the residence's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under [[Harry S. Truman]], the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing [[steel frame]] constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.\n\nThe modern-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building]]\u2014the former State Department, which now houses offices for the president's staff and the vice president\u2014and [[Blair House]], a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six stories\u2014the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story [[White House basement|basement]]. The property is a [[National Heritage Site (United States)|National Heritage Site]] owned by the [[National Park Service]] and is part of the [[President's Park]]. In 2007, it was ranked second{{r|1AvjX}} on the [[American Institute of Architects]] list of \"[[America's Favorite Architecture]]\".\n\n==Early history==\n\n===1789\u20131800===\n{{further|Presidency of George Washington#Residences}}\nFollowing his April 1789 inauguration, President [[George Washington]] occupied two private houses in New York City as the executive mansion. He lived at the first, known as the [[Samuel Osgood House|Franklin House]] and owned by Treasury Commissioner [[Samuel Osgood]], at 3 Cherry Street through late February 1790.{{r|Baker1897}}{{r|mvorg}}  The executive mansion moved to the larger quarters of the [[Alexander Macomb House]] at 39\u201341 Broadway{{r|mvorg}} where he stayed, with his wife and a small staff until August 1790. In May 1790, New York began construction of a \"proper\" house for the presidential mansion, [[Government House (New York City)|Government House]].{{r|Stokes}} Washington never used the mansion because it was not completed until after the national capital was moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in December 1790.{{r|Stokes}}\n\nThe July 1790 [[Residence Act]] designated the capital be permanently located in the new [[Washington, D.C.|Federal District]], and temporarily in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] for ten years while the permanent capital was built.{{r|6ylva}} Philadelphia rented the mansion of the wealthy merchant [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] at 190 High Street (now 524\u201330 Market Street) as the [[President's House (Philadelphia)|President's House]], which Washington occupied from November 1790 to March 1797.{{r|ushist}}  Since the house was too small to accommodate the thirty people that made up the presidential family, staff, and servants, Washington had it enlarged.{{r|ushist}} \n\nPresident [[John Adams]] also occupied the High Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On Saturday, November 1, 1800, he became the first president to occupy the White House.{{r|jK8YA}}\n\nThe President's House in Philadelphia was converted into the Union Hotel, and later used for stores before being demolished in 1832.{{r|ushist}}\n\nPhiladelphia began construction of a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away in 1792. It was nearly completed by the time of Adam's 1797 inauguration. However, Adams declined to occupy it saying he did not have Congressional authorization to lease the building. It remained vacant until it was sold to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1800.{{r|Westcott1894}}\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=100px>\nFile:The First Presidential Mansion.jpg|First Presidential Mansion: [[Samuel Osgood House]], Manhattan, New York.

However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the U.S., [[Jean Jules Jusserand]], popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, \"Pierre Charles L'Enfant\". (Reference: Bowling, Kenneth R (2002). ''Peter Charles L'Enfant: vision, honor, and male friendship in the early American Republic.'' George Washington University, Washington, D.C. {{ISBN|978-0-9727611-0-9}}). The [[United States Code]] states in {{USC|40|3309}}: \"(a) In General.\u2014The purposes of this chapter shall be carried out in the District of Columbia as nearly as may be practicable in harmony with the plan of Peter Charles L'Enfant.\" The [[National Park Service]] identifies L'Enfant as \"[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/text.htm#washington Major Peter Charles L'Enfant]\" and as \"[https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/presidents/washington_monument.html Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]\" on its website.}} 1791 [[L'Enfant Plan|plan]] for the newly established federal city, Washington, D.C.{{r|IYuWd}} Washington and his Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]], who both had personal interests in architecture, agreed that the design of the White House, and the Capital, would be chosen in a [[Architectural design competition|design competition]].{{r|Frary}}\n\nAlthough all proposals for the Capital were rejected, an acceptable drawing for the White House submitted by [[James Hoban]] was selected from several including one submitted anonymously by Jefferson himself.{{r|np7Jl}}\n\nHoban was born in Ireland and trained at the [[Dublin Society of Arts]]. He emigrated to the US after the revolution, first seeking work in Philadelphia and later finding success in [[South Carolina]] where he designed several buildings including the state capitol at [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]. Hoban ultimately supervised the construction of both the US Capitol and the White House.{{r|u1v6F}}\n\nPresident Washington visited [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in May 1791 on his \"Southern Tour\", and saw the under-construction [[Charleston County Courthouse]] designed by Hoban. He is reputed to have met with Hoban then. The following year, he summoned the architect to Philadelphia and met with him in June 1792.{{r|eYnQA}}\n\nOn July 16, 1792, the president met with the commissioners of the federal city to make his judgment in the architectural competition. His review is recorded as being brief, and he quickly selected Hoban's submission.{{r|nUHxy}}\n\n===Design influences===\nThe building has classical inspiration sources, that could be found directly or indirectly in the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] or in [[Andrea Palladio]] styles; Palladio being an Italian architect of the [[Renaissance]] which had a considerable influence on the Western architecture ([[Palladian architecture]]). The building Hoban designed is verifiably influenced by the upper floors of [[Leinster House]], in [[Dublin]], which later became the seat of the [[Oireachtas]] (the Irish parliament).{{r|Ywh2c}} Several other Georgian-era Irish country houses have been suggested as sources of inspiration for the overall floor plan, details like the bow-fronted south front, and interior details like the former niches in the present [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. These influences, though undocumented, are cited in the official White House guide, and in [[White House Historical Association]] publications. The first official White House guide, published in 1962, suggested a link between Hoban's design for the South Portico and [[Ch\u00e2teau de Rastignac]], a neoclassical country house located in [[La Bachellerie]] in the [[Dordogne]] region of France and designed by Mathurin Salat. Construction on the French house was initially started before 1789, interrupted by the [[French Revolution]] for twenty years and then finally built 1812\u20131817 (based on Salat's pre-1789 design).{{r|France?}} The theoretical link between the two houses has been criticized because Hoban did not visit France. Supporters of a connection posit that [[Thomas Jefferson]], during his tour of [[Bordeaux]] in 1789, viewed Salat's architectural drawings (which were on-file at the College) at the [[\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale d'Architecture]] (Bordeaux Architectural College).{{r|johnson}}  On his return to the U.S. he then shared the influence with Washington, Hoban, Monroe, and [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]].{{r|France?}}\n\n===Construction===\n\nConstruction of the White House began with the laying of the cornerstone on October 13, 1792, although there was no formal ceremony.{{r|yLpeA}} The main residence, as well as foundations of the house, were built largely by [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] and free [[African-American]] laborers, as well as employed Europeans.{{r|mJ52j}} Much of the other work on the house was performed by immigrants, many not yet with citizenship. The sandstone walls were erected by [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrants, employed by Hoban,{{r|whha overview}} as were the high-relief rose and garland decorations above the north entrance and the \"fish scale\" pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods. There are conflicting claims as to where the sandstone used in the construction of the White House originated. Some reports suggest sandstone from the [[Croatia]]n island of [[Bra\u010d]] (specifically the [[Pu\u010di\u0161\u0107a]] querry whose stone was used to build the ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Diocletian's Palace|palace]] of [[Diocletian|Emperor Diocletian]]) was used in the original construction of the building, contrarily researchers believe limestone from the island was used in the 1902 renovations and not the original construction. Others suggest the original sandstone simply came from [[Aquia Creek]] in [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]], [[Virginia]], as importing the stone would be too costly.{{r|zQgqd}}{{r|L0Ydi}}{{r|J1ZuL}} The initial construction took place over a period of eight years, at a reported cost of $232,371.83 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|232371.83|1800}}}} today). Although not yet completed, the White House was ready for occupancy circa November 1, 1800.{{r|XEjY4}}\n\nShortages, including material and labor, forced alterations to the earlier plan developed by French engineer [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] for a \"palace\" that was five times larger than the house that was eventually built.{{r|whha overview}} The finished structure contained only two main floors instead of the planned three, and a less costly brick served as a lining for the stone fa\u00e7ades. When construction was finished, the porous sandstone walls were [[whitewash]]ed with a mixture of lime, rice glue, casein, and lead, giving the house its familiar color and name.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nSeveral [[replicas of the White House]] have been constructed.\n\n===Architectural description===\n\nThe north front is the principal fa\u00e7ade of the White House and consists of three floors and eleven bays. The ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and [[parapet]], thus the fa\u00e7ade appears to be of two floors. The central three bays are behind a [[Prostyle|prostyle portico]] (this was a later addition to the house, built circa 1830) serving, thanks to the carriage ramp, as a [[porte cochere]]. The windows of the four bays flanking the portico, at first-floor level, have alternating pointed and segmented [[pediment]]s, while at second-floor level the pediments are flat. The principal entrance at the center of the portico is surmounted by a [[lunette]] [[fanlight]]. Above the entrance is a sculpted floral [[festoon]]. The roofline is hidden by a balustraded [[parapet]].\n\nThe mansion's southern fa\u00e7ade is a combination of the [[Palladian]] and neoclassical styles of architecture. It is of three floors, all visible. The ground floor is [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] in the Palladian fashion. At the center of the fa\u00e7ade is a neoclassical projecting bow of three bays. The bow is flanked by five bays, the windows of which, as on the north fa\u00e7ade, have alternating segmented and pointed pediments at first-floor level. The bow has a ground floor [[double staircase]] leading to an [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[colonnade]]d [[loggia]] (with the [[Truman Balcony]] at second-floor level), known as the south portico. The more modern third floor is hidden by a balustraded parapet and plays no part in the composition of the fa\u00e7ade.\n\n===Naming conventions===\n\nThe building was originally variously referred to as the \"President's Palace\", \"Presidential Mansion\", or \"President's House\".{{r|xVvhI}} The earliest evidence of the public calling it the \"White House\" was recorded in 1811.{{r|8Rmlj}} A myth emerged that during the rebuilding of the structure after the [[Burning of Washington]], white paint was applied to mask the burn damage it had suffered,{{r|A3bMb}} giving the building its namesake hue.{{r|EdqBf}} The name \"Executive Mansion\" was used in official contexts until President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established the formal name by having \"White House\u2013Washington\" engraved on the stationery in 1901.{{r|Qtiju}}{{r|WH facts}} The current letterhead wording and arrangement \"The White House\" with the word \"Washington\" centered beneath goes back to the administration of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].{{r|WH facts}}\n\nAlthough the structure was not completed until some years after the presidency of George Washington, there is speculation that the name of the traditional residence of the president of the United States may have derived from [[Martha Washington]]'s home, [[White House (plantation)|White House Plantation]] in Virginia, where the nation's first president had courted the first lady in the mid-18th century.{{r|D7o2v}}\n\n==Evolution of the White House==\n\n===Early use, the 1814 fire, and rebuilding===\n\nOn Saturday, November 1, 1800, [[John Adams]] became the first president to take residence in the building.{{r|whha overview}} The next day he wrote his wife Abigail:\n\"I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.\"{{r|whha state dining room}} \nFranklin D. Roosevelt had Adams's blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room.{{r|whha state dining room}}\n\nAdams lived in the house only briefly before [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the \"pleasant country residence\"{{r|NRJJd}} in 1801. Despite his complaints that the house was too big (\"big enough for two emperors, one pope, and the grand lama in the bargain\"{{r|sacjA}}), Jefferson considered how the White House might be added to. With [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], he helped lay out the design for the East and West Colonnades, small wings that help conceal the domestic operations of laundry, a stable and storage.{{r|whha overview}} Today, Jefferson's colonnades link the residence with the East and West Wings.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nIn 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the White House was set ablaze by British troops{{r|whha east room}} during the [[Burning of Washington]], in retaliation for burning of [[Port Dover]] and other towns in [[Upper Canada]]; much of Washington was affected by these fires as well. Only the exterior walls remained, and they had to be torn down and mostly reconstructed because of weakening from the fire and subsequent exposure to the elements, except for portions of the south wall. Of the numerous objects taken from the White House when it was ransacked by British troops, only two have been recovered. Employees and slaves rescued a painting of George Washington,{{r|whha east room}} and in 1939, a Canadian man returned a jewelry box to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], claiming that his grandfather had taken it from Washington. Some observers allege that most of these spoils were lost when a convoy of British ships led by [[HMS Fantome (1810)|HMS ''Fantome'']] sank en route to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] off [[Prospect, Nova Scotia|Prospect]] during a storm on the night of November 24, 1814,{{r|K9M68}}{{r|iDYQ3}} even though ''Fantome'' had no involvement in that action.{{r|2ZhT4}}\n\nAfter the fire, President [[James Madison]] resided in [[The Octagon House (Washington, D.C.)|the Octagon House]] from 1814 to 1815, and then the [[Seven Buildings]] from 1815 to the end of his term.{{r|KQzqy}} Meanwhile, both architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe and Hoban contributed to the design and oversight of the reconstruction, which lasted from 1815 until 1817. The south [[portico]] was constructed in 1824 during the [[James Monroe]] administration; the north portico was built six years later.{{r|whha overview}} Though Latrobe proposed similar porticos before the fire in 1814, both porticos were built as designed by Hoban.{{r|tbe3z}} An elliptical portico at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Rastignac]] in La Bachellerie, France with nearly identical curved stairs is speculated as the source of inspiration due to its similarity with the South Portico,{{r|wh museum 1825-1872}} although this matter is one of great debate.{{r|wSPdx}} Italian artisans, brought to Washington to help in constructing the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]], carved the decorative stonework on both porticos. Contrary to speculation, the North Portico was not modeled on a similar portico on another Dublin building, the [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in|Viceregal Lodge]] (now ''\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in'', residence of the [[President of Ireland]]), for its portico postdates the White House porticos' design.{{r|wh museum 1825-1872}} For the North Portico, a variation on the [[Ionic Order]] was devised incorporating a swag of roses between the volutes. This was done to link the new portico with the earlier carved roses above the entrance.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:The President's House by George Munger, 1814-1815 - Crop.jpg|The White House as it looked following the fire of August 24, 1814\nFile:White-House.jpg|[[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Latrobe]]'s West Wing Colonnade, in this nineteenth-century engraved view, is now the [[James S.

The location of the White House was questioned, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for [[malaria]] and other unhealthy conditions.{{r|epstein}} Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler was tasked to propose solutions to address these concerns. He proposed abandoning the use of the White House as a residence and designed a new estate for the first family at [[Meridian Hill Park|Meridian Hill]] in Washington, D.C., but Congress rejected the plan.{{r|epstein}} Another site under consideration was Metropolis View, today the campus of [[The Catholic University of America]].{{r|MqIIY}}\n\n[[File:WhiteHouseProposedAddition.jpg|thumb|right|Additions proposed by architect Frederick D. Owen (1901).]]\n[[File:1860s White House.jpg|thumb|right|The [[North Lawn (White House)|North Lawn]] during the [[Abraham Lincoln]] administration]]\n\nWhen [[Chester A. Arthur]] took office in 1881, he ordered renovations to the White House to take place as soon as the recently widowed [[Lucretia Garfield]] moved out. Arthur inspected the work almost nightly and made several suggestions. [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] was asked to send selected designers to assist. Over twenty wagonloads of furniture and household items were removed from the building and sold at a [[public auction]].{{r|reeves268}} All that was saved were bust portraits of [[John Adams]] and [[Martin Van Buren]].{{r|reevesn473}} A proposal was made to build a new residence south of the White House, but it failed to gain support.\n\nIn the fall of 1882 work was done on the main corridor, including tinting the walls pale olive and adding squares of [[gold leaf]], and decorating the ceiling in gold and silver, and colorful [[Tracery|traceries]] woven to spell \"USA\". The Red Room was painted a dull Pomeranian red, and its ceiling was decorated with gold, silver, and copper stars and stripes of red, white, and blue. A fifty-foot jeweled [[Tiffany glass|Tiffany]] glass screen, supported by imitation marble columns, replaced the glass doors that separated the main corridor from the north vestibule.{{r|reeves269}}{{r|bFjvZ}}\n\nIn 1891, First Lady [[Caroline Harrison]] proposed major extensions to the White House, including a National Wing on the east for a historical art gallery, and a wing on the west for official functions.{{r|epstein}} A plan was devised by Colonel Theodore A. Bingham, which reflected the Harrison proposal.{{r|epstein}} These plans were ultimately rejected.\n\nHowever, in 1902 [[Theodore Roosevelt]] hired [[McKim, Mead & White]] to carry out expansions and renovations in a neoclassical style suited to the building's architecture, removing the Tiffany screen and all Victorian additions.{{r|Yl4bH}}{{r|R6fqD}}  [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles McKim]] himself designed and managed the project, which gave more living space to the president's large family by removing a staircase in the West Hall and moving executive office staff from the second floor of the residence into the new West Wing.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nPresident [[William Howard Taft]] enlisted the help of architect [[Nathan C. Wyeth]] to add additional space to the West Wing, which included the addition of the [[Oval Office]].{{r|epstein}}  In 1925, Congress enacted legislation allowing the White House to accept gifts of furniture and art for the first time.{{r|AbbottRice|p=17}} The West Wing was damaged by fire on Christmas Eve 1929; [[Herbert Hoover]] and his aides moved back into it on April 14, 1930.{{r|oeGVZ}} \nIn the 1930s, a second story was added, as well as a larger basement for White House staff, and President Franklin Roosevelt had the Oval Office moved to its present location: adjacent to the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]].{{r|whha overview}}\n\n===Truman reconstruction===\n{{main|White House Reconstruction}}\n[[File:The Shell of the White House during the Renovation-05-17-1950.jpg|thumb|[[Harry S.

Truman]]{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} took a great toll on the brick and sandstone structure built around a timber frame.{{r|whha overview}} By 1948, the house was declared to be in imminent danger of collapse, forcing President Truman to commission a reconstruction and to live across the street at [[Blair House]] from 1949 to 1951.{{r|OA7bu}} The work, done by the firm of [[Philadelphia]] contractor [[John McShain]], required the complete dismantling of the interior spaces, construction of a new load-bearing internal steel frame and the reconstruction of the original rooms within the new structure.{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} The total cost of the renovations was about $5.7 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5.7|1951|r=0}}}} million in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{r|vm2mG}} Some modifications to the floor plan were made, the largest being the repositioning of the grand staircase to open into the Entrance Hall, rather than the Cross Hall.{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} Central air conditioning was added, as well as two additional sub-basements providing space for workrooms, storage, and a bomb shelter.{{r|whha overview}} The Trumans moved back into the White House on March 27, 1952.{{r|whha overview}} While the house's structure was kept intact by the Truman reconstruction, much of the new interior finishes were generic, and of little historic value. Much of the original plasterwork, some dating back to the 1814\u20131816 rebuilding, was too damaged to reinstall, as was the original robust Beaux Arts paneling in the East Room. President Truman had the original timber frame sawn into paneling; the walls of the [[Vermeil Room]], [[Library (White House)|Library]], [[China Room]], and [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]] on the ground floor of the main residence were paneled in wood from the timbers.{{r|UtzOl}}\n\n===Jacqueline Kennedy restoration===\n[[File:BoudinRedRoom.jpg|thumb|The [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]] as designed by [[St\u00e9phane Boudin]] during the presidency of John F.

She enlisted the help of [[Henry Francis du Pont]] of the [[Winterthur Museum]] to assist in collecting artifacts for the mansion, many of which had once been housed there.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} Other antiques, fine paintings, and improvements of the Kennedy period were donated to the White House by wealthy philanthropists, including the [[Crowninshield family]], [[Jane Engelhard]], [[Jayne Wrightsman]], and the Oppenheimer family.\n\n[[St\u00e9phane Boudin]] of the [[Maison Jansen|House of Jansen]], a Paris interior-design firm that had been recognized worldwide, was employed by Jacqueline Kennedy to assist with the decoration.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} Different periods of the early republic and world history were selected as a theme for each room: the Federal style for the [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]], French Empire for the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]], American Empire for the [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], Louis XVI for the [[Yellow Oval Room]], and Victorian for the president's study, renamed the [[Treaty Room]]. Antique furniture was acquired, and decorative fabric and trim based on period documents was produced and installed. The Kennedy restoration resulted in a more authentic White House of grander stature, which recalled the French taste of Madison and Monroe.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} In the [[Diplomatic Reception Room (White House)|Diplomatic Reception Room]], Mrs. Kennedy installed an antique \"Vue de l'Am\u00e9rique Nord\" wallpaper which [[Zuber & Cie]] had designed in 1834. The wallpaper had hung previously on the walls of another mansion until 1961 when that house was demolished for a grocery store. Just before the demolition, the wallpaper was salvaged and sold to the White House.\n\nThe first White House guidebook was produced under the direction of curator Lorraine Waxman Pearce with direct supervision from Mrs. Kennedy.{{r|OLizx}} Sale of the guidebook helped finance the restoration.\n\nKennedy showed her restoration of the White House to the public in [[A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F.

This prevented them from being sold (as many objects in the executive mansion had been in the past 150 years). When not in use or display at the White House, these items were to be turned over to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for preservation, study, storage, or exhibition. The White House retains the right to have these items returned.{{r|AbbottRice|p=29}}\n\nOut of respect for the historic character of the White House, no substantive architectural changes have been made to the house since the Truman renovation.{{r|YsEpb}} Since the Kennedy restoration, every presidential family has made some changes to the private quarters of the White House, but the [[Committee for the Preservation of the White House]] must approve any modifications to the State Rooms. Charged with maintaining the historical integrity of the White House, the congressionally authorized committee works with each First Family\u2014usually represented by the first lady, the [[White House Office of the Curator|White House curator]], and the [[White House Chief Usher|chief usher]]\u2014to implement the family's proposals for altering the house.{{r|nJVBo}}\n\nDuring the Nixon Administration (1969\u20131974), First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] refurbished the Green Room, Blue Room, and Red Room, working with Clement Conger, the curator appointed by President [[Richard Nixon]].{{r|t2zEz}} Mrs. Nixon's efforts brought more than 600 artifacts to the house, the largest acquisition by any administration.{{r|MF74M}} Her husband created the modern press briefing room over [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s old swimming pool.{{r|press room}} Nixon also added a single-lane bowling alley to the White House basement.{{r|gMser}}\n\nComputers and the first laser printer were added during the Carter administration, and the use of computer technology was expanded during the Reagan administration.{{r|gff8t}} A Carter-era innovation, a set of [[solar heating|solar water heating panels]] that were mounted on the roof of the White House, was removed during Reagan's presidency.{{r|wq6cM}}{{r|Burdick}} Redecorations were made to the private family quarters and maintenance was made to public areas during the Reagan years.{{r|da1980}} The house was accredited as a museum in 1988.{{r|da1980}}\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] refurbished some rooms with the assistance of [[Arkansas]] decorator Kaki Hockersmith, including the Oval Office, the East Room, Blue Room, [[State Dining Room of the White House|State Dining Room]], Lincoln Bedroom, and Lincoln Sitting Room.{{r|wh makeover}} During the administration of [[George W. Bush]], First Lady [[Laura Bush]] refurbished the Lincoln Bedroom in a style contemporary with the Lincoln era; the Green Room, [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]], and theater were also refurbished.{{r|wh makeover}}\n\nThe White House became one of the first wheelchair-accessible government buildings in Washington when modifications were made during the presidency of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who used a wheelchair because of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|his paralytic illness]]. In the 1990s, [[Hillary Clinton]], at the suggestion of Visitors Office Director Melinda N. Bates, approved the addition of a ramp in the East Wing corridor. It allowed easy [[wheelchair]] access for the public tours and special events that enter through the secure entrance building on the east side.\n\nIn 2003, the Bush administration reinstalled solar thermal heaters.{{r|Burdick}} These units are used to heat water for landscape maintenance personnel and for the presidential pool and spa. 167 solar photovoltaic grid-tied panels were installed at the same time on the roof of the maintenance facility. The changes were not publicized as a White House spokeswoman said the changes were an internal matter. The story was picked up by industry trade journals.{{r|FCAxL}} In 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] had a set of [[solar panel]]s installed on the roof of the White House, making it the first time solar power would be used for the president's living quarters.{{r|ztiyM}}{{r|BA0aA}}\n\n===Layout and amenities===\n\nToday the group of buildings housing the presidency is known as the White House Complex. It includes the central [[Executive Residence]] flanked by the [[East Wing]] and [[West Wing]]. The [[White House Chief Usher|Chief Usher]] coordinates day to day household operations. The White House includes: six stories and 55,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup> (5,100 m<sup>2</sup>) of floor space, 132 rooms and 35 bathrooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, twenty-eight fireplaces, eight staircases, three elevators, five full-time chefs, a tennis court, a (single-lane) bowling alley, a movie theater (officially called the [[White House Family Theater]]{{r|JDYhZ}}), a jogging track, a swimming pool, and a putting green.{{r|WH facts}} It receives up to 30,000 visitors each week.{{r|bumiller200901}}\n{{multiple image\n | align =center\n | direction =horizontal\n | perrow = 3\n | image1 = White House and grounds.png\n | width1 = 68\n | caption1 = Layout of entire site\n | image2 = WHComplex.svg\n | width2 = 300\n | caption2 = White House Complex\n | image3 = White House West Wing FloorPlan1.svg\n | width3 = 168\n | caption3 = [[West Wing]]\n | image4 = WHground.svg\n | width4 = 150\n | caption4 = Ground floor\n | image5 = White House State Floor.svg\n | width5 = 153\n | caption5 = State floor\n | image6 = White House FloorPlan2.svg\n | width6 = 150\n | caption6 = Second floor (residence)\n}}\n\n===Executive Residence===\n{{Main|Executive Residence}}\n\nThe original residence is in the center. Two [[colonnade]]s\u2014one on the east and one on the west\u2014designed by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings added later. The [[Executive Residence]] houses the president's dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining. The State Floor of the residence building includes the [[East Room]], [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]], [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]], [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], [[State Dining Room]], [[Family Dining Room]], [[Cross Hall]], [[Entrance Hall]], and [[Grand Staircase (White House)|Grand Staircase]].{{r|OwkS5}} The Ground Floor is made up of the [[Diplomatic Reception Room]], [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]], [[China Room]], [[Vermeil Room]], [[White House Library|Library]], the main kitchen, and other offices.{{r|8vyYA}} The second floor family residence includes the [[Yellow Oval Room]], [[East Sitting Hall|East]] and [[West Sitting Hall]]s, the White House Master Bedroom, [[President's Dining Room]], the [[Treaty Room]], [[Lincoln Bedroom]] and [[Queens' Bedroom]], as well as two additional bedrooms, a smaller kitchen, and a private dressing room.{{r|S4zYx}} The third floor consists of the White House Solarium, Game Room, Linen Room, a Diet Kitchen, and another sitting room (previously used as President George W. Bush's workout room).{{r|gqDUm}}\n\n===West Wing===\n{{Main|West Wing}}\n\nThe West Wing houses the president's office (the [[Oval Office]]) and offices of his senior staff, with room for about 50 employees. It also includes the [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]], where the president conducts business meetings and where the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meets,{{r|kzExn}} as well as the [[White House Situation Room]], [[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room]], and [[Roosevelt Room]].{{r|cQOP2}} In 2007, work was completed on renovations of the press briefing room, adding [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] cables and [[LCD]] screens for the display of charts and graphs.{{r|press room2}} The makeover took 11 months and cost of $8 million, out of which news outlets paid $2 million.{{r|press room2}} In September 2010, [[White House Big Dig|a two-year project]] began on the West Wing, creating a multistory underground structure.{{r|vyYFd}}\n\nSome members of the President's staff are located in the adjacent [[Old Executive Office Building]], formerly the State War and Navy building, and sometimes known as the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.{{r|press room2}}\n\nThe Oval Office, Roosevelt Room, and other portions of the West Wing were partially replicated on a [[sound stage]] and used as the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] for the popular television show ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]''.{{r|wKroZ}}\n\n===East Wing===\n{{Main|East Wing}}\n\nThe East Wing, which contains additional office space, was added to the White House in 1942. Among its uses, the East Wing has intermittently housed the offices and staff of the [[First Lady of the United States|first lady]], and the White House Social Office. [[Rosalynn Carter]], in 1977, was the first to place her personal office in the East Wing and to formally call it the \"Office of the First Lady\". The East Wing was built during [[World War II]] in order to hide the construction of an underground bunker to be used in emergencies. The bunker has come to be known as the [[Presidential Emergency Operations Center]].\n\n===Grounds===\nThe White House and grounds cover just over 18 acres (about 7.3 hectares). Before the construction of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the [[South Lawn (White House)|South Lawn]], which was graded and planted by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the [[North Lawn (White House)|North Lawn]] that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger [[greenhouse]]s were built on the west side of the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds. The general layout of the White House grounds today is based on the 1935 design by [[Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.]] of the [[Olmsted Brothers]] firm, commissioned by  President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the Kennedy administration, the [[White House Rose Garden]] was redesigned by [[Rachel Lambert Mellon]]. The Rose Garden borders the West Colonnade. Bordering the East Colonnade is the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Garden]], which was begun by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] but completed after her husband's assassination. On the weekend of June 23, 2006, a century-old [[American Elm|American Elm (''Ulmus americana'' L.)]] tree on the north side of the building came down during one of the many storms amid [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006|intense flooding]]. Among the oldest trees on the grounds are several magnolias (''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'') planted by Andrew Jackson, including the Jackson Magnolia, reportedly grown from a sprout taken from the favorite tree of Jackson's recently deceased wife, the sprout planted after Jackson moved into the White House. The tree stood for over 200 years; but in 2017, having become too weak to stand on its own, it was decided it should be removed and replaced with one of its offspring.{{r|CcD01}}{{r|KpnOF}} Michelle Obama planted the White House's first organic garden and installed beehives on the South Lawn of the White House, which will supply organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.{{r|U4C8Y}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:White-house-floor1-cross-Hall.jpg|The [[Cross Hall]], connecting the [[State Dining Room]] and the [[East Room]] on the State Floor\nFile:WhSouthLawn.JPEG|[[Marine One]] prepares to land on the South Lawn, where [[State Arrival Ceremony|State Arrival Ceremonies]] are held.\nFile:White House, Blue Sky.jpg|View from the south, with fountain\nFile:1122-WAS-The White House.JPG|View from the north\nFile:The White House at night, 2011.jpg|White House at night, view from the north\n</gallery>\n\n==Public access and security==\n{{See also|White House Visitors Office|List of White House security breaches}}\n\n===Historical accessibility===\nLike the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] followed him home, where he greeted them in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President [[Andrew Jackson]] had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected [[Grover Cleveland]] arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President [[Bill Clinton]] briefly revived the New Year's Day open house in his first term.\n\nThe White House remained accessible in other ways; President [[Abraham Lincoln]] complained that he was constantly beleaguered by job seekers waiting to ask him for political appointments or other favors, or eccentric dispensers of advice like \"General\" [[Daniel Pratt (eccentric)|Daniel Pratt]], as he began the business day. Lincoln put up with the annoyance rather than risk alienating some associate or friend of a powerful politician or opinion maker.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Aviation incidents===\n{{Update|section|date=April 2015}}<!-- April 15, 2015 incident; possibly January 2015 if drones count -->\nIn February 1974, a stolen army helicopter [[1974 White House helicopter incident|landed without authorization]] on the White House's grounds.{{r|bXgDO}} Twenty years later, in 1994, a light plane flown by [[Frank Eugene Corder]] crashed on the White House grounds, and he died instantly.{{r|JO4kZ}}\n\nAs a result of increased security regarding air traffic in the capital, the White House was evacuated in May 2005 before an unauthorized aircraft could approach the grounds.{{r|ZScbt}}\n\n===Closure of Pennsylvania Avenue===\n[[File:U.S. Secret Service Agent.jpg|left|thumb|A uniformed U.S. Secret Service Agent on Pennsylvania Avenue.]]\nOn May 20, 1995, primarily as a response to the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] of April 19, 1995, the [[United States Secret Service]] closed off Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White House from the eastern edge of Lafayette Park to 17th Street. Later, the closure was extended an additional block to the east to 15th Street, and East Executive Avenue, a small street between the White House and the [[Treasury Building (Washington, D.C.)|Treasury Building]].\n\nAfter [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], this change was made permanent in addition to closing E Street between the South Portico of the White House and [[the Ellipse]].{{r|VuiCP}} In response to the [[Boston Marathon bombing]], the road was closed to the public in its entirety for a period of two days.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Avenue closing has been opposed by organized civic groups in Washington, D.C. They argue that the closing impedes traffic flow unnecessarily and is inconsistent with the well-conceived historic plan for the city. As for security considerations, they note that the White House is set much farther back from the street than numerous other sensitive federal buildings are.{{r|F17OZ}}\n\nPrior to its inclusion within the fenced compound that now includes the [[Old Executive Office Building]] to the west and the Treasury Building to the east, this sidewalk served as a queuing area for the daily public tours of the White House. These tours were suspended in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. In September 2003, they resumed on a limited basis for groups making prior arrangements through their Congressional representatives or embassies in Washington for foreign nationals and submitting to background checks, but the White House remained closed to the public.{{r|6Dutd}} White House tours were suspended for most of 2013 due to budget constraints after [[Budget sequestration in 2013|sequestration]].{{r|1xVao}} The White House reopened to the public in November 2013.{{r|msl6S}}\n\n===Protection===\nThe White House Complex is protected by the [[United States Secret Service]] and the [[United States Park Police]].\n\n[[NASAMS]] (Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System) were used to guard air space over Washington, D.C. during the 2005 presidential inauguration. The same NASAMS units have since been used to protect the president and all airspace around the White House, which is strictly prohibited to aircraft.{{r|2YCbp}}{{r|D55GA}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:PennAveWhiteHouse.jpg|For security reasons, the section of Pennsylvania Avenue on the north side of the White House is closed to all vehicular traffic, except government officials.\nFile:US $20 Series 2006 Reverse.jpg|North front of the White House on the reverse (back) of the [[United States twenty-dollar bill|U.S. $20 bill]].\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Pedro Casanave]]\n* [[Camp David]]\n* [[Germantown White House]]\n* [[Graphics and Calligraphy Office]]\n* [[List of largest houses in the United States]]\n* [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Washington, D.C.]]\n* [[List of residences of Presidents of the United States]]\n* [[List of residences of Presidents of the United States#Western White House]]\n* [[Number One Observatory Circle]], residence of the Vice President\n* [[Reportedly haunted locations in the District of Columbia#White House|Reported White House ghosts]]\n* [[:Category:Rooms in the White House]]\n* [[White House Acquisition Trust]]\n* [[White House Chief Calligrapher]]\n* [[White House Chief Floral Designer]]\n* [[White House Christmas tree]]\n* [[White House Communications Agency]]\n* [[White House Endowment Trust]]\n* [[White House Executive Chef]]\n* [[White House Fellows]]\n* ''[[White House History]]''\n* [[White House Social Secretary]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2013a}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Baker1897\">{{cite book|last=Baker|first=William Spohn|title=Washington After the Revolution: 1784-1799|url=https://archive.org/details/washingtonafter00bakegoog|accessdate=January 15, 2020|year=1897|page=[https://archive.org/details/washingtonafter00bakegoog/page/n125 118]}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mvorg\">{{cite web |title=Presidential Residency in New York |url=https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/presidential-residency-in-new-york/ |website=mountvernon.org |publisher=The Fred W.

Eggs are laid on the water surface; they hatch into motile larvae that feed on aquatic [[algae]] and [[wikt:organic|organic]] material. The adult females of most species have tube-like mouthparts (called a [[proboscis]]) that can pierce the skin of a [[Host (biology)|host]] and [[Hematophagy|feed on blood]], which contains [[protein]] and [[iron]] needed to produce [[egg]]s.

This loss of blood is seldom of any importance to the host.\n\nThe mosquito's [[saliva]] is transferred to the host during the bite, and can cause an itchy [[rash]]. In addition, many species can ingest [[pathogen]]s while biting, and transmit them to future hosts. In this way, mosquitoes are important [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s of diseases such as [[malaria]], [[yellow fever]], [[Chikungunya]], [[West Nile virus|West Nile]], [[dengue fever]], [[filariasis]], [[Zika virus|Zika]] and other [[arboviruses]].

Their wings are long and narrow, same with their long, thin legs. They have slender and dainty bodies of length typically from 3 mm to 6 mm, with a color of dark grey to black, some species have specific patterns. When at rest, they tend to hold their first pair of legs outward. They look similar to midge flies (''[[Chironomidae]]''), another ancient family of flies. ''[[Tokunagayusurika akamusi]],'' for example, is a midge fly that look very much alike mosquitoes in that they also have slender and dainty bodies of similar colors, though larger in size. They also have only one pair of wings, but without scales on the surface. Another distinct feature to tell the two families of flies apart is the way they hold their first pair of legs - mosquitoes hold them outward, while midges hold them forward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nature.mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/field-guide/midges|title=Midges|website=MDC Discover Nature|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref>\n\n== Life cycle ==\n[[File:Wyeomyia smithii 1.jpg|right|thumb|Image of pitcher plant mosquito ''[[Wyeomyia smithii]]'', showing segmentation and partial anatomy of circulatory system]]\n\n===Overview===\nLike all flies, mosquitoes go through four stages in their life cycles: [[egg (biology)|egg]], [[larva]], [[pupa]], and adult or [[imago]]. The first three stages\u2014egg, larva, and pupa\u2014are largely aquatic. Each of the stages typically lasts 5 to 14 days, depending on the species and the ambient temperature, but there are important exceptions.<ref>American Mosquito Control Association https://www.mosquito.org/page/faq</ref> Mosquitoes living in regions where some seasons are freezing or waterless spend part of the year in ''[[diapause]]''; they delay their development, typically for months, and carry on with life only when there is enough water or warmth for their needs. For instance, ''Wyeomyia'' larvae typically get frozen into solid lumps of ice during winter and only complete their development in spring. The eggs of some species of ''Aedes'' remain unharmed in diapause if they dry out, and hatch later when they are covered by water.\n\nEggs hatch to become [[larva]]e, which grow until they are able to change into [[pupa]]e. The adult mosquito emerges from the mature pupa as it floats at the water surface. Bloodsucking mosquitoes, depending on species, sex, and weather conditions, have potential adult lifespans ranging from as short as a week to as long as several months. Some species can overwinter as adults in diapause.<ref>Kosova, Jonida (2003) [http://digitalcommons.unf.edu/ojii_volumes/94 \"Longevity Studies of Sindbis Virus Infected Aedes Albopictus\"].

Michigan Department of Agriculture June 2002</ref>\n\n===Breeding===\nIn most species, adult females lay their eggs in stagnant water: some lay near the water's edge while others attach their eggs to aquatic plants. Each species selects the situation of the water into which it lays its eggs and does so according to its own ecological adaptations. Some breed in lakes, some in temporary puddles. Some breed in marshes, some in salt-marshes. Among those that breed in salt water, some are equally at home in fresh and salt water up to about one-third the concentration of seawater, whereas others must acclimatize themselves to the salinity.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Wigglesworth VB |year=1933|journal=J Exp Biol |volume=10|pages=27\u201336|title=The Adaptation of Mosquito Larvae to Salt Water|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/10/1/27|issue=1}}</ref> Such differences are important because certain ecological preferences keep mosquitoes away from most humans, whereas other preferences bring them right into houses at night.\n\nSome species of mosquitoes prefer to breed in [[phytotelma]]ta (natural reservoirs on plants), such as rainwater accumulated in holes in tree trunks, or in the leaf-axils of [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]]. Some specialize in the liquid in pitchers of particular species of [[pitcher plant]]s, their larvae feeding on decaying insects that had drowned there or on the associated bacteria; the genus ''Wyeomyia'' provides such examples \u2014 the harmless ''Wyeomyia smithii'' breeds only in the pitchers of ''[[Sarracenia purpurea]]''.<ref>Crans, Wayne J.; [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~insects/sp27.htm ''Wyeomyia smithii'' (Coquillett)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605173233/http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~insects/sp27.htm |date=2013-06-05 }}. Rutgers University, Center for Vector Biology.</ref>\n\nHowever, some of the species of mosquitoes that are adapted to breeding in phytotelmata are dangerous disease vectors. In nature, they might occupy anything from a hollow tree trunk to a cupped leaf. Such species typically take readily to breeding in artificial water containers. Such casual puddles are important breeding places for some of the most serious disease vectors, such as species of ''[[Aedes]]'' that transmit dengue and yellow fever. Some with such breeding habits are disproportionately important vectors because they are well-placed to pick up [[pathogen]]s from humans and pass them on. In contrast, no matter how voracious, mosquitoes that breed and feed mainly in remote wetlands and salt marshes may well remain uninfected, and if they do happen to become infected with a relevant pathogen, might seldom encounter humans to infect, in turn.\n\n===Eggs and oviposition===\n[[File:Mosquito egg SEM.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scanning electron microscope|Electron micrograph]] of a mosquito egg]]\nMosquito habits of [[oviposition]], the ways in which they lay their eggs, vary considerably between species, and the [[Morphology (biology)|morphologies]] of the eggs vary accordingly. The simplest procedure is that followed by many species of ''[[Anopheles]]''; like many other [[Gracility|gracile]] species of aquatic insects, females just fly over the water, bobbing up and down to the water surface and dropping eggs more or less singly. The bobbing behavior occurs among some other aquatic insects as well, for example [[Mayfly|mayflies]] and [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]]; it is sometimes called \"[[dapping]]\". The eggs of ''Anopheles'' species are roughly cigar-shaped and have floats down their sides. Females of many common species can lay 100\u2013200 eggs during the course of the adult phase of their life cycles. Even with high egg and intergenerational mortality, over a period of several weeks, a single successful breeding pair can create a population of thousands.\n\n[[File:Gelege1.jpg|thumb|An egg raft of a ''Culex'' species, partly broken, showing individual egg shapes]]\n\nSome other species, for example members of the genus ''[[Mansonia]]'', lay their eggs in arrays, attached usually to the under-surfaces of waterlily pads. Their close relatives, the genus ''Coquillettidia'', lay their eggs similarly, but not attached to plants. Instead, the eggs form layers called \"rafts\" that float on the water. This is a common mode of oviposition, and most species of ''Culex'' are known for the habit, which also occurs in some other genera, such as ''[[Culiseta]]'' and ''[[Uranotaenia]]''. ''Anopheles'' eggs may on occasion cluster together on the water, too, but the clusters do not generally look much like compactly glued rafts of eggs.\n\nIn species that lay their eggs in rafts, rafts do not form adventitiously; the female ''Culex'' settles carefully on still water with its hind legs crossed, and as it lays the eggs one by one, it twitches to arrange them into a head-down array that sticks together to form the raft.<ref name=\"Spielman, D'Antonio\">{{cite book |author1=Spielman, Andrew |author2=D'Antonio, M. |title=Mosquito : a natural history of our most persistent and deadly foe |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7868-6781-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/mosquitonaturalh00spie }}</ref>\n\n''Aedes'' females generally drop their eggs singly, much as ''Anopheles'' do, but not as a rule into water. Instead, they lay their eggs on damp mud or other surfaces near the water's edge. Such an oviposition site commonly is the wall of a cavity such as a hollow stump or a container such as a bucket or a discarded vehicle tire. The eggs generally do not hatch until they are flooded, and they may have to withstand considerable desiccation before that happens. They are not resistant to desiccation straight after oviposition, but must develop to a suitable degree first. Once they have achieved that, however, they can enter diapause for several months if they dry out. Clutches of eggs of the majority of mosquito species hatch as soon as possible, and all the eggs in the clutch hatch at much the same time. In contrast, a batch of ''Aedes'' eggs in diapause tends to hatch irregularly over an extended period of time. This makes it much more difficult to control such species than those mosquitoes whose larvae can be killed all together as they hatch. Some ''Anopheles'' species do also behave in such a manner, though not to the same degree of sophistication.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang J, Walker ED, Vulule J, Miller JR |title=Daily temperature profiles in and around Western Kenyan larval habitats of Anopheles gambiae as related to egg mortality |journal=Malaria Journal |volume=5 |issue= |pages=87 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17038186 |pmc=1617108 |doi=10.1186/1475-2875-5-87 }}</ref>\n\n=== Larva ===\n[[File:Culex restuans larva diagram en.svg|thumb|Anatomy of a ''[[Culex]]'' larva]]\nThe mosquito larva has a well-developed head with mouth brushes used for feeding, a large [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] with no legs, and a segmented [[abdomen]].\n\nLarvae breathe through [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s located on their eighth abdominal segments, or through a siphon, so must come to the surface frequently.

Larvae swim either through [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]] with their mouth brushes, or by jerky movements of their entire bodies, giving them the common name of \"wigglers\" or \"wrigglers\".\n\nLarvae develop through four stages, or [[instar]]s, after which they [[metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into [[pupae]]. At the end of each instar, the larvae molt, shedding their skins to allow for further growth.\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Anopheles larve.jpg|''[[Anopheles]]'' larva from southern Germany, about 8&nbsp;mm long\nFile:Comstock Immature Mosquito IMG 6217.JPG|''Culex'' larva and pupa\nFile:Culex sp larvae.png|''Culex'' larvae plus one pupa\n</gallery>\n\n=== Pupa ===\nAs seen in its [[Anatomical terms of location|lateral]] aspect, the mosquito pupa is comma-shaped. The head and thorax are merged into a [[cephalothorax]], with the abdomen curving around underneath. The pupa can swim actively by flipping its abdomen, and it is commonly called a \"tumbler\" because of its swimming action. As with the larva, the pupa of most species must come to the surface frequently to breathe, which they do through a pair of respiratory trumpets on their cephalothoraxes. However, pupae do not feed during this stage; typically they pass their time hanging from the surface of the water by their respiratory trumpets. If alarmed, say by a passing shadow, they nimbly swim downwards by flipping their abdomens in much the same way as the larvae do. If undisturbed, they soon float up again.\n\nAfter a few days or longer, depending on the temperature and other circumstances, the [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal]] surface of its cephalothorax splits, and the adult mosquito emerges. The pupa is less active than the larva because it does not feed, whereas the larva feeds constantly.<ref name=\"Spielman, D'Antonio\"/>\n\n=== Adult ===\n[[File:Culex pipiens diagram en.svg|thumb|right|Anatomy of an adult mosquito]]\n\nThe period of development from egg to adult varies among species and is strongly influenced by ambient temperature. Some species of mosquitoes can develop from egg to adult in as few as five days, but a more typical period of development in tropical conditions would be some 40 days or more for most species. The variation of the body size in adult mosquitoes depends on the density of the larval population and food supply within the breeding water.\n\nAdult mosquitoes usually mate within a few days after emerging from the pupal stage. In most species, the males form large [[swarm]]s, usually around dusk, and the females fly into the swarms to mate.\n\nMales typically live for about 5\u20137 days, feeding on [[nectar]] and other sources of [[sugar]]. After obtaining a full blood meal, the female will rest for a few days while the blood is digested and eggs are developed. This process depends on the temperature, but usually takes two to three days in tropical conditions. Once the eggs are fully developed, the female lays them and resumes host-seeking.\n\nThe cycle repeats itself until the female dies. While females can live longer than a month in captivity, most do not live longer than one to two weeks in nature. Their lifespans depend on temperature, humidity, and their ability to successfully obtain a blood meal while avoiding host defenses and predators.\n\nThe length of the adult is typically between 3 mm and 6 mm. The smallest known mosquitoes are around {{convert|2|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and the largest around {{convert|19|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Service|first=Mike|title=Medical Entomology for Students|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|edition=5th|isbn=978-1-107-66818-8}}</ref> Mosquitoes typically weigh around 5&nbsp;mg. All mosquitoes have slender bodies with three segments: a head, a thorax and an abdomen.\n\nThe [[head]] is specialized for receiving sensory information and for feeding. It has eyes and a pair of long, many-segmented [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. The antennae are important for detecting host odors, as well as odors of breeding sites where females lay eggs. In all mosquito species, the antennae of the males in comparison to the females are noticeably bushier and contain auditory receptors to detect the characteristic whine of the females.\n[[File:Aedes aegypti E-A-Goeldi 1905.jpg|thumb|Adult yellow fever mosquito ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'', typical of subfamily [[Culicinae]].

Some species feed selectively on monkeys, while others prefer particular kinds of birds, but they become less selective as conditions become more difficult. For example, ''[[Culiseta]] melanura'' sucks the blood of [[passerine]] birds for preference, and such birds are typically the main reservoir of the [[Eastern equine encephalitis virus]] in North America. Early in the season while mosquito numbers are low, they concentrate on passerine hosts, but as mosquito numbers rise and the birds are forced to defend themselves more vigorously, the mosquitoes become less selective of hosts. Soon the mosquitoes begin attacking mammals more readily, thereby becoming the major vector of the virus, and causing epidemics of the disease, most conspicuously in humans and horses.<ref name=\"Lehane2005\">{{cite book|author=M.

Apart from bloodsucking, the females generally also drink assorted fluids rich in dissolved sugar, such as nectar and honeydew, to obtain the energy they need. For this, their blood-sucking mouthparts are perfectly adequate. In contrast, male mosquitoes are not bloodsuckers; they only drink sugary fluids. Accordingly, their mouthparts do not require the same degree of specialization as those of females.<ref name=\"WSM\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wahid I, Sunahara T, Mogi M |title=Maxillae and mandibles of male mosquitoes and female autogenous mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) |journal=Journal of Medical Entomology |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=150\u20138 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12693842 |doi=10.1603/0022-2585-40.2.150 }}</ref>\n\nExternally, the most obvious feeding structure of the mosquito is the proboscis. More specifically, the visible part of the proboscis is the [[Labium (insect)|labium]], which forms the sheath enclosing the rest of the mouthparts. When the mosquito first lands on a potential host, its mouthparts are enclosed entirely in this sheath, and it will touch the tip of the labium to the skin in various places. Sometimes, it will begin to bite almost straight away, while other times, it will prod around, apparently looking for a suitable place. Occasionally, it will wander for a considerable time, and eventually fly away without biting. Presumably, this probing is a search for a place with easily accessible blood vessels, but the exact mechanism is not known. It is known that there are two taste receptors at the tip of the labium which may well play a role.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\">{{cite book |first1=Gary |last1=Mullen |first2=Lance |last2=Durden | name-list-format = vanc |year=2009 |title=Medical and Veterinary Entomology |publisher=Academic Press |location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe female mosquito does not insert its labium into the skin; it bends back into a bow when the mosquito begins to bite. The tip of the labium remains in contact with the skin of the victim, acting as a guide for the other mouthparts. In total, there are six mouthparts besides the labium: two [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]], two [[Galea (insects)|maxillae]], the [[Insect mouthparts#Hypopharynx|hypopharynx]], and the [[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]].\n\nThe mandibles and the maxillae are used for piercing the skin. The mandibles are pointed, while the maxillae end in flat, toothed \"blades\". To force these into the skin, the mosquito moves its head backwards and forwards. On one movement, the maxillae are moved as far forward as possible. On the opposite movement, the mandibles are pushed deeper into the skin by levering against the maxillae. The maxillae do not slip back because the toothed blades grip the skin.\n\nThe hypopharynx and the labrum are both hollow. Saliva with anticoagulant is pumped down the hypopharynx to prevent clotting, and blood is drawn up the labrum.\n\nTo understand the mosquito mouthparts, it is helpful to draw a comparison with an insect that chews food, such as a [[dragonfly]]. A dragonfly has two mandibles, which are used for chewing, and two maxillae, which are used to hold the food in place as it is chewed. The labium forms the floor of the dragonfly's mouth, the labrum forms the top, while the hypopharynx is inside the mouth and is used in swallowing. Conceptually, then, the mosquito's proboscis is an adaptation of the mouthparts that occur in other insects. The labium still lies beneath the other mouthparts, but also enfolds them, and it has been extended into a proboscis. The maxillae still \"grip\" the \"food\" while the mandibles \"bite\" it. The top of the mouth, the labrum, has developed into a channeled blade the length of the proboscis, with a cross-section like an inverted \"U\". Finally, the hypopharynx has extended into a tube that can deliver saliva at the end of the proboscis. Its upper surface is somewhat flattened so, when the lower part of the hypopharynx is pressed against it, the labrum forms a closed tube for conveying blood from the victim.<ref name=\"isbn0-412-61390-5\">{{cite book |author1=Richards, O.

Females with poor larval nutrition may need to ingest sugar or a preliminary blood meal bring ovarian follicles to their resting stage. Once the follicles have reached the resting stage, digestion of a sufficiently large blood meal triggers a hormonal cascade that leads to egg development.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/> Upon completion of feeding, the mosquito withdraws her [[proboscis]], and as the gut fills up, the stomach lining secretes a [[Peritrophic matrix|peritrophic membrane]] that surrounds the blood. This membrane keeps the blood separate from anything else in the stomach. However, like certain other insects that survive on dilute, purely liquid diets, notably many of the [[Hemiptera]], many adult mosquitoes must excrete unwanted aqueous fractions even as they feed. (See the photograph of a feeding ''Anopheles stephensi'': Note that the excreted droplet patently is not whole blood, being far more dilute). As long as they are not disturbed, this permits mosquitoes to continue feeding until they have accumulated a full meal of nutrient solids. As a result, a mosquito replete with blood can continue to absorb sugar, even as the blood meal is slowly digested over a period of several days.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/><ref name=\"pmid24315597\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Curic G, Hercog R, Vrselja Z, Wagner J |title=Identification of person and quantification of human DNA recovered from mosquitoes (Culicidae) |journal=Forensic Science International.

These are used as building blocks for the synthesis of [[vitellogenin]], which are the precursors for egg yolk protein.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/>\n\nIn the mosquito ''[[Anopheles stephensi]]'', trypsin activity is restricted entirely to the posterior midgut lumen. No trypsin activity occurs before the blood meal, but activity increases continuously up to 30 hours after feeding, and subsequently returns to baseline levels by 60 hours. Aminopeptidase is active in the anterior and posterior midgut regions before and after feeding. In the whole midgut, activity rises from a baseline of approximately three enzyme units (EU) per midgut to a maximum of 12 EU at 30 hours after the blood meal, subsequently falling to baseline levels by 60 hours. A similar cycle of activity occurs in the posterior midgut and posterior midgut lumen, whereas aminopeptidase in the posterior midgut epithelium decreases in activity during digestion. Aminopeptidase in the anterior midgut is maintained at a constant, low level, showing no significant variation with time after feeding. Alpha-glucosidase is active in anterior and posterior midguts before and at all times after feeding. In whole midgut homogenates, alpha-glucosidase activity increases slowly up to 18 hours after the blood meal, then rises rapidly to a maximum at 30 hours after the blood meal, whereas the subsequent decline in activity is less predictable. All posterior midgut activity is restricted to the posterior midgut lumen. Depending on the time after feeding, greater than 25% of the total midgut activity of alpha-glucosidase is located in the anterior midgut. After blood meal ingestion, proteases are active only in the posterior midgut. Trypsin is the major primary hydrolytic protease and is secreted into the posterior midgut lumen without activation in the posterior midgut epithelium. Aminopeptidase activity is also luminal in the posterior midgut, but cellular aminopeptidases are required for peptide processing in both anterior and posterior midguts. Alpha-glucosidase activity is elevated in the posterior midgut after feeding in response to the blood meal, whereas activity in the anterior midgut is consistent with a nectar-processing role for this midgut region.<ref name=\"Billingsley\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Billingsley PF, Hecker H |title=Blood digestion in the mosquito, Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae): activity and distribution of trypsin, aminopeptidase, and alpha-glucosidase in the midgut |journal=Journal of Medical Entomology |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=865\u201371 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1770523 |doi=10.1093/jmedent/28.6.865 }}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Mosquito Tasmania crop.jpg|thumb|Female ''[[Ochlerotatus notoscriptus]]'' feeding on a human arm, Tasmania, Australia]]\n\n===Distribution===\nMosquitoes are [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] (world-wide): they are in every land region except Antarctica<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/> and a few islands with polar or [[subpolar climate]]s.

At the start of the uninterrupted [[continental climate|continental]] winter of Greenland and the northern regions of Eurasia and America, the pupa enters diapause under the ice that covers sufficiently deep water. The [[imago]] [[Pupa#Emergence|emerges]] only after the ice breaks in late spring. In Iceland however, the weather is less predictable. In mid-winter it frequently warms up suddenly, causing the ice to break, but then to freeze again after a few days. By that time the mosquitoes will have emerged from their pupae, but the new freeze sets in before they can complete their life cycle. Any [[Anautogeny|anautogenous]] adult mosquito would need a host to supply a blood meal before it could lay viable eggs; it would need time to mate, mature the eggs and oviposit in suitable wetlands. These requirements would not be realistic in Iceland and in fact the absence of mosquitoes from such subpolar islands is in line with the islands' low biodiversity; Iceland has fewer than 1,500 described species of insects, many of them probably accidentally introduced by human agency. In Iceland most ectoparasitic insects live in sheltered conditions or actually on mammals; examples include lice, fleas and bedbugs, in whose living conditions freezing is no concern, and most of which were introduced inadvertently by humans.<ref name=\"Visindavefur.hi.is\"/>\n\nSome other aquatic Diptera, such as [[Simuliidae]], do survive in Iceland, but their habits and adaptations differ from those of mosquitoes; Simuliidae for example, though they, like mosquitoes, are bloodsuckers, generally inhabit stones under running water that does not readily freeze and which is totally unsuited to mosquitoes; mosquitoes are generally not adapted to running water.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Peterson BV |year=1977 |url=|journal=The Canadian Entomologist |volume=109 |issue=3|pages=449\u2013472 |doi=10.4039/Ent109449-3 |title=The Black Flies of Iceland (Diptera: Simuliidae) }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gislason G.

Their wings are long and narrow, same with their long, thin legs. They have slender and dainty bodies of length typically from 3 mm to 6 mm, with a color of dark grey to black, some species have specific patterns. When at rest, they tend to hold their first pair of legs outward. They look similar to midge flies (''[[Chironomidae]]''), another ancient family of flies. ''[[Tokunagayusurika akamusi]],'' for example, is a midge fly that look very much alike mosquitoes in that they also have slender and dainty bodies of similar colors, though larger in size. They also have only one pair of wings, but without scales on the surface. Another distinct feature to tell the two families of flies apart is the way they hold their first pair of legs - mosquitoes hold them outward, while midges hold them forward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nature.mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/field-guide/midges|title=Midges|website=MDC Discover Nature|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref>\n\n== Life cycle ==\n[[File:Wyeomyia smithii 1.jpg|right|thumb|Image of pitcher plant mosquito ''[[Wyeomyia smithii]]'', showing segmentation and partial anatomy of circulatory system]]\n\n===Overview===\nLike all flies, mosquitoes go through four stages in their life cycles: [[egg (biology)|egg]], [[larva]], [[pupa]], and adult or [[imago]]. The first three stages\u2014egg, larva, and pupa\u2014are largely aquatic. Each of the stages typically lasts 5 to 14 days, depending on the species and the ambient temperature, but there are important exceptions.<ref>American Mosquito Control Association https://www.mosquito.org/page/faq</ref> Mosquitoes living in regions where some seasons are freezing or waterless spend part of the year in ''[[diapause]]''; they delay their development, typically for months, and carry on with life only when there is enough water or warmth for their needs. For instance, ''Wyeomyia'' larvae typically get frozen into solid lumps of ice during winter and only complete their development in spring. The eggs of some species of ''Aedes'' remain unharmed in diapause if they dry out, and hatch later when they are covered by water.\n\nEggs hatch to become [[larva]]e, which grow until they are able to change into [[pupa]]e. The adult mosquito emerges from the mature pupa as it floats at the water surface. Bloodsucking mosquitoes, depending on species, sex, and weather conditions, have potential adult lifespans ranging from as short as a week to as long as several months. Some species can overwinter as adults in diapause.<ref>Kosova, Jonida (2003) [http://digitalcommons.unf.edu/ojii_volumes/94 \"Longevity Studies of Sindbis Virus Infected Aedes Albopictus\"].

Michigan Department of Agriculture June 2002</ref>\n\n===Breeding===\nIn most species, adult females lay their eggs in stagnant water: some lay near the water's edge while others attach their eggs to aquatic plants. Each species selects the situation of the water into which it lays its eggs and does so according to its own ecological adaptations. Some breed in lakes, some in temporary puddles. Some breed in marshes, some in salt-marshes. Among those that breed in salt water, some are equally at home in fresh and salt water up to about one-third the concentration of seawater, whereas others must acclimatize themselves to the salinity.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Wigglesworth VB |year=1933|journal=J Exp Biol |volume=10|pages=27\u201336|title=The Adaptation of Mosquito Larvae to Salt Water|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/10/1/27|issue=1}}</ref> Such differences are important because certain ecological preferences keep mosquitoes away from most humans, whereas other preferences bring them right into houses at night.\n\nSome species of mosquitoes prefer to breed in [[phytotelma]]ta (natural reservoirs on plants), such as rainwater accumulated in holes in tree trunks, or in the leaf-axils of [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]]. Some specialize in the liquid in pitchers of particular species of [[pitcher plant]]s, their larvae feeding on decaying insects that had drowned there or on the associated bacteria; the genus ''Wyeomyia'' provides such examples \u2014 the harmless ''Wyeomyia smithii'' breeds only in the pitchers of ''[[Sarracenia purpurea]]''.<ref>Crans, Wayne J.; [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~insects/sp27.htm ''Wyeomyia smithii'' (Coquillett)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605173233/http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~insects/sp27.htm |date=2013-06-05 }}. Rutgers University, Center for Vector Biology.</ref>\n\nHowever, some of the species of mosquitoes that are adapted to breeding in phytotelmata are dangerous disease vectors. In nature, they might occupy anything from a hollow tree trunk to a cupped leaf. Such species typically take readily to breeding in artificial water containers. Such casual puddles are important breeding places for some of the most serious disease vectors, such as species of ''[[Aedes]]'' that transmit dengue and yellow fever. Some with such breeding habits are disproportionately important vectors because they are well-placed to pick up [[pathogen]]s from humans and pass them on. In contrast, no matter how voracious, mosquitoes that breed and feed mainly in remote wetlands and salt marshes may well remain uninfected, and if they do happen to become infected with a relevant pathogen, might seldom encounter humans to infect, in turn.\n\n===Eggs and oviposition===\n[[File:Mosquito egg SEM.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scanning electron microscope|Electron micrograph]] of a mosquito egg]]\nMosquito habits of [[oviposition]], the ways in which they lay their eggs, vary considerably between species, and the [[Morphology (biology)|morphologies]] of the eggs vary accordingly. The simplest procedure is that followed by many species of ''[[Anopheles]]''; like many other [[Gracility|gracile]] species of aquatic insects, females just fly over the water, bobbing up and down to the water surface and dropping eggs more or less singly. The bobbing behavior occurs among some other aquatic insects as well, for example [[Mayfly|mayflies]] and [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]]; it is sometimes called \"[[dapping]]\". The eggs of ''Anopheles'' species are roughly cigar-shaped and have floats down their sides. Females of many common species can lay 100\u2013200 eggs during the course of the adult phase of their life cycles. Even with high egg and intergenerational mortality, over a period of several weeks, a single successful breeding pair can create a population of thousands.\n\n[[File:Gelege1.jpg|thumb|An egg raft of a ''Culex'' species, partly broken, showing individual egg shapes]]\n\nSome other species, for example members of the genus ''[[Mansonia]]'', lay their eggs in arrays, attached usually to the under-surfaces of waterlily pads. Their close relatives, the genus ''Coquillettidia'', lay their eggs similarly, but not attached to plants. Instead, the eggs form layers called \"rafts\" that float on the water. This is a common mode of oviposition, and most species of ''Culex'' are known for the habit, which also occurs in some other genera, such as ''[[Culiseta]]'' and ''[[Uranotaenia]]''. ''Anopheles'' eggs may on occasion cluster together on the water, too, but the clusters do not generally look much like compactly glued rafts of eggs.\n\nIn species that lay their eggs in rafts, rafts do not form adventitiously; the female ''Culex'' settles carefully on still water with its hind legs crossed, and as it lays the eggs one by one, it twitches to arrange them into a head-down array that sticks together to form the raft.<ref name=\"Spielman, D'Antonio\">{{cite book |author1=Spielman, Andrew |author2=D'Antonio, M. |title=Mosquito : a natural history of our most persistent and deadly foe |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7868-6781-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/mosquitonaturalh00spie }}</ref>\n\n''Aedes'' females generally drop their eggs singly, much as ''Anopheles'' do, but not as a rule into water. Instead, they lay their eggs on damp mud or other surfaces near the water's edge. Such an oviposition site commonly is the wall of a cavity such as a hollow stump or a container such as a bucket or a discarded vehicle tire. The eggs generally do not hatch until they are flooded, and they may have to withstand considerable desiccation before that happens. They are not resistant to desiccation straight after oviposition, but must develop to a suitable degree first. Once they have achieved that, however, they can enter diapause for several months if they dry out. Clutches of eggs of the majority of mosquito species hatch as soon as possible, and all the eggs in the clutch hatch at much the same time. In contrast, a batch of ''Aedes'' eggs in diapause tends to hatch irregularly over an extended period of time. This makes it much more difficult to control such species than those mosquitoes whose larvae can be killed all together as they hatch. Some ''Anopheles'' species do also behave in such a manner, though not to the same degree of sophistication.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang J, Walker ED, Vulule J, Miller JR |title=Daily temperature profiles in and around Western Kenyan larval habitats of Anopheles gambiae as related to egg mortality |journal=Malaria Journal |volume=5 |issue= |pages=87 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17038186 |pmc=1617108 |doi=10.1186/1475-2875-5-87 }}</ref>\n\n=== Larva ===\n[[File:Culex restuans larva diagram en.svg|thumb|Anatomy of a ''[[Culex]]'' larva]]\nThe mosquito larva has a well-developed head with mouth brushes used for feeding, a large [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] with no legs, and a segmented [[abdomen]].\n\nLarvae breathe through [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s located on their eighth abdominal segments, or through a siphon, so must come to the surface frequently.

Larvae swim either through [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]] with their mouth brushes, or by jerky movements of their entire bodies, giving them the common name of \"wigglers\" or \"wrigglers\".\n\nLarvae develop through four stages, or [[instar]]s, after which they [[metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into [[pupae]]. At the end of each instar, the larvae molt, shedding their skins to allow for further growth.\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Anopheles larve.jpg|''[[Anopheles]]'' larva from southern Germany, about 8&nbsp;mm long\nFile:Comstock Immature Mosquito IMG 6217.JPG|''Culex'' larva and pupa\nFile:Culex sp larvae.png|''Culex'' larvae plus one pupa\n</gallery>\n\n=== Pupa ===\nAs seen in its [[Anatomical terms of location|lateral]] aspect, the mosquito pupa is comma-shaped. The head and thorax are merged into a [[cephalothorax]], with the abdomen curving around underneath. The pupa can swim actively by flipping its abdomen, and it is commonly called a \"tumbler\" because of its swimming action. As with the larva, the pupa of most species must come to the surface frequently to breathe, which they do through a pair of respiratory trumpets on their cephalothoraxes. However, pupae do not feed during this stage; typically they pass their time hanging from the surface of the water by their respiratory trumpets. If alarmed, say by a passing shadow, they nimbly swim downwards by flipping their abdomens in much the same way as the larvae do. If undisturbed, they soon float up again.\n\nAfter a few days or longer, depending on the temperature and other circumstances, the [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal]] surface of its cephalothorax splits, and the adult mosquito emerges. The pupa is less active than the larva because it does not feed, whereas the larva feeds constantly.<ref name=\"Spielman, D'Antonio\"/>\n\n=== Adult ===\n[[File:Culex pipiens diagram en.svg|thumb|right|Anatomy of an adult mosquito]]\n\nThe period of development from egg to adult varies among species and is strongly influenced by ambient temperature. Some species of mosquitoes can develop from egg to adult in as few as five days, but a more typical period of development in tropical conditions would be some 40 days or more for most species. The variation of the body size in adult mosquitoes depends on the density of the larval population and food supply within the breeding water.\n\nAdult mosquitoes usually mate within a few days after emerging from the pupal stage. In most species, the males form large [[swarm]]s, usually around dusk, and the females fly into the swarms to mate.\n\nMales typically live for about 5\u20137 days, feeding on [[nectar]] and other sources of [[sugar]]. After obtaining a full blood meal, the female will rest for a few days while the blood is digested and eggs are developed. This process depends on the temperature, but usually takes two to three days in tropical conditions. Once the eggs are fully developed, the female lays them and resumes host-seeking.\n\nThe cycle repeats itself until the female dies. While females can live longer than a month in captivity, most do not live longer than one to two weeks in nature. Their lifespans depend on temperature, humidity, and their ability to successfully obtain a blood meal while avoiding host defenses and predators.\n\nThe length of the adult is typically between 3 mm and 6 mm. The smallest known mosquitoes are around {{convert|2|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and the largest around {{convert|19|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Service|first=Mike|title=Medical Entomology for Students|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|edition=5th|isbn=978-1-107-66818-8}}</ref> Mosquitoes typically weigh around 5&nbsp;mg.

Some species feed selectively on monkeys, while others prefer particular kinds of birds, but they become less selective as conditions become more difficult. For example, ''[[Culiseta]] melanura'' sucks the blood of [[passerine]] birds for preference, and such birds are typically the main reservoir of the [[Eastern equine encephalitis virus]] in North America. Early in the season while mosquito numbers are low, they concentrate on passerine hosts, but as mosquito numbers rise and the birds are forced to defend themselves more vigorously, the mosquitoes become less selective of hosts. Soon the mosquitoes begin attacking mammals more readily, thereby becoming the major vector of the virus, and causing epidemics of the disease, most conspicuously in humans and horses.<ref name=\"Lehane2005\">{{cite book|author=M.

Apart from bloodsucking, the females generally also drink assorted fluids rich in dissolved sugar, such as nectar and honeydew, to obtain the energy they need. For this, their blood-sucking mouthparts are perfectly adequate. In contrast, male mosquitoes are not bloodsuckers; they only drink sugary fluids. Accordingly, their mouthparts do not require the same degree of specialization as those of females.<ref name=\"WSM\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wahid I, Sunahara T, Mogi M |title=Maxillae and mandibles of male mosquitoes and female autogenous mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) |journal=Journal of Medical Entomology |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=150\u20138 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12693842 |doi=10.1603/0022-2585-40.2.150 }}</ref>\n\nExternally, the most obvious feeding structure of the mosquito is the proboscis. More specifically, the visible part of the proboscis is the [[Labium (insect)|labium]], which forms the sheath enclosing the rest of the mouthparts. When the mosquito first lands on a potential host, its mouthparts are enclosed entirely in this sheath, and it will touch the tip of the labium to the skin in various places. Sometimes, it will begin to bite almost straight away, while other times, it will prod around, apparently looking for a suitable place. Occasionally, it will wander for a considerable time, and eventually fly away without biting. Presumably, this probing is a search for a place with easily accessible blood vessels, but the exact mechanism is not known. It is known that there are two taste receptors at the tip of the labium which may well play a role.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\">{{cite book |first1=Gary |last1=Mullen |first2=Lance |last2=Durden | name-list-format = vanc |year=2009 |title=Medical and Veterinary Entomology |publisher=Academic Press |location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe female mosquito does not insert its labium into the skin; it bends back into a bow when the mosquito begins to bite. The tip of the labium remains in contact with the skin of the victim, acting as a guide for the other mouthparts. In total, there are six mouthparts besides the labium: two [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]], two [[Galea (insects)|maxillae]], the [[Insect mouthparts#Hypopharynx|hypopharynx]], and the [[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]].\n\nThe mandibles and the maxillae are used for piercing the skin. The mandibles are pointed, while the maxillae end in flat, toothed \"blades\". To force these into the skin, the mosquito moves its head backwards and forwards. On one movement, the maxillae are moved as far forward as possible. On the opposite movement, the mandibles are pushed deeper into the skin by levering against the maxillae. The maxillae do not slip back because the toothed blades grip the skin.\n\nThe hypopharynx and the labrum are both hollow. Saliva with anticoagulant is pumped down the hypopharynx to prevent clotting, and blood is drawn up the labrum.\n\nTo understand the mosquito mouthparts, it is helpful to draw a comparison with an insect that chews food, such as a [[dragonfly]]. A dragonfly has two mandibles, which are used for chewing, and two maxillae, which are used to hold the food in place as it is chewed. The labium forms the floor of the dragonfly's mouth, the labrum forms the top, while the hypopharynx is inside the mouth and is used in swallowing. Conceptually, then, the mosquito's proboscis is an adaptation of the mouthparts that occur in other insects. The labium still lies beneath the other mouthparts, but also enfolds them, and it has been extended into a proboscis. The maxillae still \"grip\" the \"food\" while the mandibles \"bite\" it. The top of the mouth, the labrum, has developed into a channeled blade the length of the proboscis, with a cross-section like an inverted \"U\". Finally, the hypopharynx has extended into a tube that can deliver saliva at the end of the proboscis. Its upper surface is somewhat flattened so, when the lower part of the hypopharynx is pressed against it, the labrum forms a closed tube for conveying blood from the victim.<ref name=\"isbn0-412-61390-5\">{{cite book |author1=Richards, O.

Females with poor larval nutrition may need to ingest sugar or a preliminary blood meal bring ovarian follicles to their resting stage. Once the follicles have reached the resting stage, digestion of a sufficiently large blood meal triggers a hormonal cascade that leads to egg development.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/> Upon completion of feeding, the mosquito withdraws her [[proboscis]], and as the gut fills up, the stomach lining secretes a [[Peritrophic matrix|peritrophic membrane]] that surrounds the blood. This membrane keeps the blood separate from anything else in the stomach. However, like certain other insects that survive on dilute, purely liquid diets, notably many of the [[Hemiptera]], many adult mosquitoes must excrete unwanted aqueous fractions even as they feed. (See the photograph of a feeding ''Anopheles stephensi'': Note that the excreted droplet patently is not whole blood, being far more dilute). As long as they are not disturbed, this permits mosquitoes to continue feeding until they have accumulated a full meal of nutrient solids. As a result, a mosquito replete with blood can continue to absorb sugar, even as the blood meal is slowly digested over a period of several days.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/><ref name=\"pmid24315597\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Curic G, Hercog R, Vrselja Z, Wagner J |title=Identification of person and quantification of human DNA recovered from mosquitoes (Culicidae) |journal=Forensic Science International.

These are used as building blocks for the synthesis of [[vitellogenin]], which are the precursors for egg yolk protein.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/>\n\nIn the mosquito ''[[Anopheles stephensi]]'', trypsin activity is restricted entirely to the posterior midgut lumen. No trypsin activity occurs before the blood meal, but activity increases continuously up to 30 hours after feeding, and subsequently returns to baseline levels by 60 hours. Aminopeptidase is active in the anterior and posterior midgut regions before and after feeding. In the whole midgut, activity rises from a baseline of approximately three enzyme units (EU) per midgut to a maximum of 12 EU at 30 hours after the blood meal, subsequently falling to baseline levels by 60 hours. A similar cycle of activity occurs in the posterior midgut and posterior midgut lumen, whereas aminopeptidase in the posterior midgut epithelium decreases in activity during digestion. Aminopeptidase in the anterior midgut is maintained at a constant, low level, showing no significant variation with time after feeding. Alpha-glucosidase is active in anterior and posterior midguts before and at all times after feeding. In whole midgut homogenates, alpha-glucosidase activity increases slowly up to 18 hours after the blood meal, then rises rapidly to a maximum at 30 hours after the blood meal, whereas the subsequent decline in activity is less predictable. All posterior midgut activity is restricted to the posterior midgut lumen. Depending on the time after feeding, greater than 25% of the total midgut activity of alpha-glucosidase is located in the anterior midgut. After blood meal ingestion, proteases are active only in the posterior midgut. Trypsin is the major primary hydrolytic protease and is secreted into the posterior midgut lumen without activation in the posterior midgut epithelium. Aminopeptidase activity is also luminal in the posterior midgut, but cellular aminopeptidases are required for peptide processing in both anterior and posterior midguts. Alpha-glucosidase activity is elevated in the posterior midgut after feeding in response to the blood meal, whereas activity in the anterior midgut is consistent with a nectar-processing role for this midgut region.<ref name=\"Billingsley\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Billingsley PF, Hecker H |title=Blood digestion in the mosquito, Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae): activity and distribution of trypsin, aminopeptidase, and alpha-glucosidase in the midgut |journal=Journal of Medical Entomology |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=865\u201371 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1770523 |doi=10.1093/jmedent/28.6.865 }}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Mosquito Tasmania crop.jpg|thumb|Female ''[[Ochlerotatus notoscriptus]]'' feeding on a human arm, Tasmania, Australia]]\n\n===Distribution===\nMosquitoes are [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] (world-wide): they are in every land region except Antarctica<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/> and a few islands with polar or [[subpolar climate]]s.

At the start of the uninterrupted [[continental climate|continental]] winter of Greenland and the northern regions of Eurasia and America, the pupa enters diapause under the ice that covers sufficiently deep water. The [[imago]] [[Pupa#Emergence|emerges]] only after the ice breaks in late spring. In Iceland however, the weather is less predictable. In mid-winter it frequently warms up suddenly, causing the ice to break, but then to freeze again after a few days. By that time the mosquitoes will have emerged from their pupae, but the new freeze sets in before they can complete their life cycle. Any [[Anautogeny|anautogenous]] adult mosquito would need a host to supply a blood meal before it could lay viable eggs; it would need time to mate, mature the eggs and oviposit in suitable wetlands. These requirements would not be realistic in Iceland and in fact the absence of mosquitoes from such subpolar islands is in line with the islands' low biodiversity; Iceland has fewer than 1,500 described species of insects, many of them probably accidentally introduced by human agency. In Iceland most ectoparasitic insects live in sheltered conditions or actually on mammals; examples include lice, fleas and bedbugs, in whose living conditions freezing is no concern, and most of which were introduced inadvertently by humans.<ref name=\"Visindavefur.hi.is\"/>\n\nSome other aquatic Diptera, such as [[Simuliidae]], do survive in Iceland, but their habits and adaptations differ from those of mosquitoes; Simuliidae for example, though they, like mosquitoes, are bloodsuckers, generally inhabit stones under running water that does not readily freeze and which is totally unsuited to mosquitoes; mosquitoes are generally not adapted to running water.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Peterson BV |year=1977 |url=|journal=The Canadian Entomologist |volume=109 |issue=3|pages=449\u2013472 |doi=10.4039/Ent109449-3 |title=The Black Flies of Iceland (Diptera: Simuliidae) }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gislason G.

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Contemporary Christians generally agree that heresy and dissent are not punishable offenses.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moor\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R. I.|title=The Formation of a Persecuting Society|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, Massachusetts| edition=second|year=2007|ISBN=978-1-4051-2964-0}}</ref>\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nAfter [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s.

Literature was eclectic, blending Christian ideas with classical tgought, often mixing genres.  The philosopher Boethius translated much of Aristotle's writings into Latin.  Gregory of Tours and Bede were historians who strove for historical accuracy and objectivity.

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

It is probably the most studied sermon in history.  This is problematic, since the original has been lost and the three writers who attended the Council of Clermont recorded three different versions which are each quite distinctive in content and style.<ref name=\"Strack\">{{cite journal|last=Strack|first=Georg|title=The Sermon of Urban II in Clermont and the Tradition of Papal Oratory|journal=medieval sermon studies|volume=5|year=2012|pages=30-45|url=https://www.mag.geschichte.uni-muenchen.de/downloads/strack_urban.pdf|access-date= April 22, 2020}}</ref>. \n\nHowever, there is some consensus that a comparison of the best 5 versions of the sermon (the three witnesses and two they told personally) makes it possible to identify the subjects Urban discussed.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the ''vita apostolica'' and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state.

It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moor\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R.

There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nAfter [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the ''vita apostolica'' and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.  Smith says, \"The charity of St. Francis may now appeal to us more than that of the crusaders, but both sprang from the same roots.\"<ref name=\"Riley-Smitth\"> {cite journal| last=RILEY-SMITH|first=JONATHAN|tutle=CRUSADING AS AN ACT OF LOVE|journal = History|volume= 65|issue= 214|year=1980|pages= 177\u2013192|publisher=JSTOR|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24419031|access-date= 22 April 2020}}</ref>   Indeed, crusading was seen as an act of Christian charity, of selfless love, of \u201claying down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends\u201d: an act of duty and service, to God and to others.<ref name=\"Hayes\">{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first= Sarah E.|year= 2014|title=Strange Bedfellows : The Rise of the Military Religious Orders in the Twelfth Century|journal=The Gettysburg Historical Journal|volume=13|issue=1 Article 7|url=https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/ghj/vol13/iss1/7|access-date= 23 April 2020}}</ref>.\n\n==High Middle Ages==\nIdeas such as holy war and Christian chivalry, in both Christian thought and culture, evolved gradually from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>  This can be traced in expressions of law, traditions, tales, prophecy, and historical narratives, in letters, bulls and poems written during the crusading period.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.
