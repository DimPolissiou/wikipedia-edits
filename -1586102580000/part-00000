However, he remained on their books as a senior pro for just one season before being released without making a first team appearance in July 1988. He joined fellow Midlanders [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] the following day and made his league debut on 10 January 1989 as a substitute in a 2\u20130 win against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff]].\n\nHe made the vast majority of his [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] appearances between 1990-1992 (in the second tier), and from then onward made only sporadic first team outings. He was eventually sold in June 1995 to [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] for \u00a375,000.\n\nAt [[Edgeley Park]], he quickly became a first choice player and was part of the team that won promotion from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in [[1996-97 in English football#Nationwide League Division Two|1996\u201397]], a season which also saw them reach the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] semi-finals. Here, he played in his preferred midfield role rather than the full-back position he had usually occupied with his previous club.\n\nHis career at County was interrupted by a broken leg sustained at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham]] in January 1998. This injury ended his status as an automatic choice and he made just 17 further appearances for the club over the following two seasons.\n\nAfter 146 appearances in total, he left Stockport for [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] in July 2000, after previously having had two loan spells with them. He became their captain and helped them gain promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] via the play-offs in his first full season, beating [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in the final. He was a virtual ever-present in their first season back in the second flight, but departed at its conclusion for [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]].\n\nHe played in Boston's inaugural season in the [[Football League]], but left midway through their second season for fellow [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]].
