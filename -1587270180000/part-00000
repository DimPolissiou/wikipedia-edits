Focus stacking can also be useful in [[landscape photography]].\n\nFocus stacking offers flexibility: since it is a computational technique, images with several different depths of field can be generated in post-processing and compared for best artistic merit or scientific clarity. Focus stacking also allows generation of images physically impossible with normal imaging equipment; images with nonplanar focus regions can be generated. Alternative techniques for generating images with increased or flexible depth of field include [[wavefront coding]] and [[light-field camera]]s.\n\n==Technique==\nThe starting point for focus stacking is a series of images captured at different focus distances; in each image different areas of the sample will be in focus. While none of these images has the sample entirely in focus they collectively contain all the data required to generate an image which has all parts of the sample in focus.

Focus stacking can also be useful in [[landscape photography]].\n\nFocus stacking offers flexibility: since it is a computational technique, images with several different depths of field can be generated in post-processing and compared for best artistic merit or scientific clarity. Focus stacking also allows generation of images physically impossible with normal imaging equipment; images with nonplanar focus regions can be generated. Alternative techniques for generating images with increased or flexible depth of field include [[wavefront coding]] and [[light-field camera]]s.\n\n==Technique==\nThe starting point for focus stacking is a series of images captured at different focus distances; in each image different areas of the sample will be in focus. While none of these images has the sample entirely in focus they collectively contain all the data required to generate an image which has all parts of the sample in focus. In-focus regions of each image may be detected automatically, for example via [[edge detection]] or [[Fourier analysis]], or selected manually. The in-focus patches are then blended together to generate the final image.\n\nThis processing is also called z-stacking, focal plane merging (or zedification in French).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lenaturaliste.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=253&t=3397&p=50691 |title=Afficher le sujet - Proposition d'un terme fran\u00e7ais pour \"focus stacking\" \u2022 Le Naturaliste |publisher=Lenaturaliste.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msss.com/science/msl-mahli-instrument-description.php |title=Malin Space Science Systems - Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) Instrument Description |publisher=Msss.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hindesite - Lily - Focus Stacking (by).ogv|thumb|upright|Video example of how focus stacking is applied to images]]\n\n===In photography===\nGetting sufficient [[depth of field]] can be particularly challenging in [[macro photography]], because depth of field is smaller (shallower) for objects nearer the camera, so if a small object fills the frame, it is often so close that its entire depth cannot be in focus at once.

[[Michael Grant (classicist)|Michael Grant]] stresses that the [[Hellenistic Greeks]] were viewed by contemporary [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] as having declined and diminished in greatness since the age of [[Classical Greece]], an attitude that has continued even into the works of modern [[historiography]]. Regarding Hellenistic Egypt, Grant argues, \"Cleopatra VII, looking back upon all that her ancestors had done during that time, was not likely to make the same mistake. But she and her contemporaries of the first century BC had another, peculiar, problem of their own. Could the 'Hellenistic Age' (which we ourselves often regard as coming to an end in about her time) still be said to exist at all, could ''any'' Greek age, now that [[Roman Republic|the Romans]] were the dominant power? This was a question never far from Cleopatra's mind. But it is quite certain that she considered the Greek epoch to be by no means finished, and intended to do everything in her power to ensure its perpetuation.\"</ref> Her native language was [[Koine Greek]], and she was the first Ptolemaic ruler to learn the [[Egyptian language]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"languages\"/>\n\nIn 58 BC, Cleopatra presumably accompanied her father, King [[Ptolemy XII]], during his exile to Rome after a revolt in Egypt (a [[Roman client state]]) allowed his daughter [[Berenice IV]] to claim the throne. Berenice was killed in 55 BC when the King returned to Egypt with Roman military assistance. When he died in 51 BC, the joint [[reign of Cleopatra]] and her brother [[Ptolemy XIII]] began, but a falling-out between them led to open [[Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator#Civil war|civil war]]. After losing the 48 BC [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in [[Roman Greece|Greece]] against his rival [[Julius Caesar]] (a [[Roman dictator]] and [[Roman consul|consul]]) in [[Caesar's Civil War]], the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman [[Pompey]] fled to Egypt. Pompey had been a political ally of Ptolemy XII, but Ptolemy XIII, at the urging of his court eunuchs, had Pompey ambushed and killed before Caesar arrived and occupied [[Alexandria]]. Caesar then attempted to reconcile the rival Ptolemaic siblings, but Ptolemy's chief adviser [[Potheinos]] viewed Caesar's terms as favoring Cleopatra, so [[Ptolemaic army|his forces]] [[Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)|besieged her and Caesar at the palace]]. Shortly after the siege was lifted by reinforcements, Ptolemy died in the [[47 BC Battle of the Nile]]. His sister [[Arsinoe IV]] was eventually exiled to [[Ephesus]] for her role in carrying out the siege. Caesar declared Cleopatra and her brother [[Ptolemy XIV]] joint rulers, but maintained a private affair with Cleopatra that produced Caesarion. Cleopatra traveled to Rome as a client queen in 46 and 44 BC, where she stayed at Caesar's [[Roman villa|villa]]. After the [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinations of Caesar]] and (on her orders) Ptolemy XIV in 44 BC, she named Caesarion co-ruler.\n\nIn the [[Liberators' civil war]] of 43\u201342 BC, Cleopatra sided with the Roman [[Second Triumvirate]] formed by Caesar's grandnephew and heir [[Octavian]], [[Mark Antony]], and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]]. After their meeting at [[Tarsos]] in 41 BC, the queen had an affair with Antony. He carried out the execution of Arsinoe at her request, and became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding and military aid during [[Antony's Parthian War|his invasions]] of the [[Parthian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. The [[Donations of Alexandria]] declared their children [[Alexander Helios]], [[Cleopatra Selene II]], and [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (son of Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]] rulers over various erstwhile territories under Antony's triumviral authority. This event, their marriage, and Antony's divorce of Octavian's sister [[Octavia Minor]] led to the [[Final War of the Roman Republic|Final War]] of the [[Roman Republic]]. Octavian engaged in a war of propaganda, forced Antony's allies in the [[Roman Senate]] to flee Rome in 32 BC, and declared war on Cleopatra. After defeating Antony and Cleopatra's naval fleet at the 31 BC [[Battle of Actium]], [[Roman army of the late Republic|Octavian's forces]] invaded Egypt in 30 BC and defeated Antony, leading to Antony's suicide. When Cleopatra learned that Octavian planned to bring her to his [[Roman triumph]]al procession, she killed herself by poisoning (contrary to the popular belief that she was bitten by an [[Asp (reptile)|asp]]).\n\nCleopatra's legacy survives in ancient and modern [[List of cultural depictions of Cleopatra|works of art]]. [[Roman historiography]] and [[Latin poetry]] produced a generally critical view of the queen that pervaded later [[Medieval literature|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance literature]]. In the visual arts, her ancient depictions include [[Roman portraiture|Roman busts]], [[Roman art|paintings]], and [[Roman sculpture|sculpture]]s, [[cameo carving]]s and [[cameo glass|glass]], [[Ptolemaic coinage|Ptolemaic]] and [[Roman currency|Roman coinage]], and [[relief]]s. In [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque art]] she was the subject of many works including [[opera]]s, paintings, poetry, sculptures, and theatrical dramas. She has become a [[pop culture icon]] of [[Egyptomania]] since the [[Victorian era]], and in modern times Cleopatra has appeared in the applied and fine arts, [[burlesque]] satire, Hollywood films, and [[brand image]]s for commercial products.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe Latinized form Cleopatra comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{transl|grc|Kleop\u00e1tr\u0101}}

[[Michael Grant (classicist)|Michael Grant]] stresses that the [[Hellenistic Greeks]] were viewed by contemporary [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] as having declined and diminished in greatness since the age of [[Classical Greece]], an attitude that has continued even into the works of modern [[historiography]]. Regarding Hellenistic Egypt, Grant argues, \"Cleopatra VII, looking back upon all that her ancestors had done during that time, was not likely to make the same mistake. But she and her contemporaries of the first century BC had another, peculiar, problem of their own. Could the 'Hellenistic Age' (which we ourselves often regard as coming to an end in about her time) still be said to exist at all, could ''any'' Greek age, now that [[Roman Republic|the Romans]] were the dominant power? This was a question never far from Cleopatra's mind. But it is quite certain that she considered the Greek epoch to be by no means finished, and intended to do everything in her power to ensure its perpetuation.\"</ref> Her native language was [[Koine Greek]], and she was the first Ptolemaic ruler to learn the [[Egyptian language]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"languages\"/>\n\nIn 58 BC, Cleopatra presumably accompanied her father, King [[Ptolemy XII]], during his exile to Rome after a revolt in Egypt (a [[Roman client state]]) allowed his daughter [[Berenice IV]] to claim the throne. Berenice was killed in 55 BC when the King returned to Egypt with Roman military assistance. When he died in 51 BC, the joint [[reign of Cleopatra]] and her brother [[Ptolemy XIII]] began, but a falling-out between them led to open [[Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator#Civil war|civil war]]. After losing the 48 BC [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in [[Roman Greece|Greece]] against his rival [[Julius Caesar]] (a [[Roman dictator]] and [[Roman consul|consul]]) in [[Caesar's Civil War]], the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman [[Pompey]] fled to Egypt. Pompey had been a political ally of Ptolemy XII, but Ptolemy XIII, at the urging of his court eunuchs, had Pompey ambushed and killed before Caesar arrived and occupied [[Alexandria]]. Caesar then attempted to reconcile the rival Ptolemaic siblings, but Ptolemy's chief adviser [[Potheinos]] viewed Caesar's terms as favoring Cleopatra, so [[Ptolemaic army|his forces]] [[Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)|besieged her and Caesar at the palace]]. Shortly after the siege was lifted by reinforcements, Ptolemy died in the [[47 BC Battle of the Nile]]. His sister [[Arsinoe IV]] was eventually exiled to [[Ephesus]] for her role in carrying out the siege. Caesar declared Cleopatra and her brother [[Ptolemy XIV]] joint rulers, but maintained a private affair with Cleopatra that produced Caesarion. Cleopatra traveled to Rome as a client queen in 46 and 44 BC, where she stayed at Caesar's [[Roman villa|villa]]. After the [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinations of Caesar]] and (on her orders) Ptolemy XIV in 44 BC, she named Caesarion co-ruler.\n\nIn the [[Liberators' civil war]] of 43\u201342 BC, Cleopatra sided with the Roman [[Second Triumvirate]] formed by Caesar's grandnephew and heir [[Octavian]], [[Mark Antony]], and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]]. After their meeting at [[Tarsos]] in 41 BC, the queen had an affair with Antony. He carried out the execution of Arsinoe at her request, and became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding and military aid during [[Antony's Parthian War|his invasions]] of the [[Parthian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. The [[Donations of Alexandria]] declared their children [[Alexander Helios]], [[Cleopatra Selene II]], and [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (son of Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]] rulers over various erstwhile territories under Antony's triumviral authority. This event, their marriage, and Antony's divorce of Octavian's sister [[Octavia Minor]] led to the [[Final War of the Roman Republic|Final War]] of the [[Roman Republic]]. Octavian engaged in a war of propaganda, forced Antony's allies in the [[Roman Senate]] to flee Rome in 32 BC, and declared war on Cleopatra. After defeating Antony and Cleopatra's naval fleet at the 31 BC [[Battle of Actium]], [[Roman army of the late Republic|Octavian's forces]] invaded Egypt in 30 BC and defeated Antony, leading to Antony's suicide. When Cleopatra learned that Octavian planned to bring her to his [[Roman triumph]]al procession, she killed herself by poisoning (contrary to the popular belief that she was bitten by an [[Asp (reptile)|asp]]).\n\nCleopatra's legacy survives in ancient and modern [[List of cultural depictions of Cleopatra|works of art]]. [[Roman historiography]] and [[Latin poetry]] produced a generally critical view of the queen that pervaded later [[Medieval literature|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance literature]]. In the visual arts, her ancient depictions include [[Roman portraiture|Roman busts]], [[Roman art|paintings]], and [[Roman sculpture|sculpture]]s, [[cameo carving]]s and [[cameo glass|glass]], [[Ptolemaic coinage|Ptolemaic]] and [[Roman currency|Roman coinage]], and [[relief]]s. In [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque art]] she was the subject of many works including [[opera]]s, paintings, poetry, sculptures, and theatrical dramas. She has become a [[pop culture icon]] of [[Egyptomania]] since the [[Victorian era]], and in modern times Cleopatra has appeared in the applied and fine arts, [[burlesque]] satire, Hollywood films,

However, as explained by {{harvtxt|Fletcher|2008|pp=82, 88\u201393}}, the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|native Egyptian priesthood]] was strongly linked to their Ptolemaic royal patrons, to the point where Cleopatra is speculated to have had an Egyptian half-cousin, [[Pasherienptah III]], the [[High Priest of Ptah]] at [[Memphis, Egypt]].</ref> [[Michael Grant (classicist)|Michael Grant]] asserts that there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemy and no known Egyptian wife of a Ptolemy, further arguing that Cleopatra probably did not have any Egyptian ancestry and \"would have described herself as Greek.\"{{sfnp|Grant|1972|p=5}}<ref group=\"note\">{{harvtxt|Grant|1972|p=5}} argues that Cleopatra's grandmother, i.e. the mother of Ptolemy XII, might have been a [[Syrians|Syrian]] (though conceding that \"it is possible she was also partly Greek\"), but almost certainly not an Egyptian because there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemaic ruler throughout their entire dynasty.</ref> [[Stacy Schiff]] writes that Cleopatra was a Macedonian Greek with some Persian ancestry, arguing that it was rare for the Ptolemies to have an Egyptian mistress.{{sfnp|Schiff|2011|pp=2, 42}}<ref group=\"note\">{{harvtxt|Schiff|2011|p=42}} further argues that, considering Cleopatra's ancestry, she was not dark-skinned, though notes Cleopatra was likely not among the Ptolemies with fair features, and instead would have been honey-skinned, citing as evidence that her relatives were described as such and it \"would have presumably applied to her as well.\" {{harvtxt|Goldsworthy|2010|pp=127, 128}} agrees to this, contending that Cleopatra, having Macedonian blood with a little Syrian, was probably not dark-skinned (as Roman propaganda never mentions it), writing \"fairer skin is marginally more likely considering her ancestry,\" though also notes she could have had a \"darker more Mediterranean complexion\" because of her mixed ancestry. {{harvtxt|Grant|1972|p=5}} agrees to Goldsworthy's latter speculation of her skin color, that though almost certainly not Egyptian, Cleopatra had a darker complexion due to being Greek mixed with Persian and possible Syrian ancestry. {{harvtxt|Preston|2009|p=77}} agrees with Grant that, considering this ancestry, Cleopatra was \"almost certainly dark-haired and olive-skinned.\" {{harvtxt|Bradford|2000|p=14}} contends that it is \"reasonable to infer\" Cleopatra had dark hair and \"pale olive skin.\"</ref> [[Duane W. Roller]] speculates that Cleopatra could have been the daughter of a theoretical half-Macedonian-Greek, half-Egyptian woman from [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in northern Egypt belonging to a family of priests dedicated to [[Ptah]] (a hypothesis not generally accepted in scholarship),<ref group=\"note\">For further information on the identity of Cleopatra's mother, see {{harvtxt|Burstein|2004|p=11}}, {{harvtxt|Fletcher|2008|p=73}}, {{harvtxt|Goldsworthy|2010|pp=127, 128}}, {{harvtxt|Grant|1972|p=4}}, and {{harvtxt|Roller|2010|pp=165\u2013166}}. [[Joann Fletcher]] finds this hypothesis to be dubious and lacking evidence. [[Stanley M. Burstein]] claims that strong circumstantial evidence suggests Cleopatra's mother could have been a member of the [[High Priest of Ptah|priestly family of Ptah]], but that historians generally assume her mother was Cleopatra V Tryphaena, wife of Ptolemy XII. [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] dismisses the idea of Cleopatra's mother being a member of an Egyptian priestly family as \"pure conjecture,\" adding that either Cleopatra V or a concubine \"probably of Greek origin\" would be Cleopatra VII's mother. [[Michael Grant (classicist)|Michael Grant]] contends that Cleopatra V was most likely Cleopatra VII's mother. [[Duane W. Roller]] notes that while Cleopatra could have been the daughter of the priestly family of Ptah, the other main candidate would be Cleopatra VI, maintaining the uncertainty stems from Cleopatra V/VI's \"loss of favor\" that \"obscured the issue.\"</ref> but contends that whatever Cleopatra's ancestry, she valued her Greek Ptolemaic heritage the most.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|pp=15, 18, 166}}<ref group=\"note\">{{harvtxt|Schiff|2011|pp=2}} concurs with this, concluding that Cleopatra \"upheld the family tradition.\" As noted by {{harvtxt|Dudley|1960|pp=57}}, Cleopatra and her family were \"the successor[s] to the native Pharaohs, exploiting through a highly organized bureaucracy the great natural resources of the Nile Valley.\"</ref> [[Ernle Bradford]] writes that Cleopatra challenged Rome not as an Egyptian woman \"but as a civilized Greek.\"{{sfnp|Bradford|2000|p=17}}\n\nClaims that Cleopatra was an [[illegitimate]] child never appeared in Roman propaganda against her.{{sfnp|Grant|1972|p=4}}{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=165}}<ref group=\"note\">{{harvtxt|Grant|1972|p=4}} argues that if Cleopatra had been illegitimate, her \"numerous Roman enemies would have revealed this to the world.\"</ref> Strabo was the only ancient historian who claimed that Ptolemy XII's children born after Berenice IV, including Cleopatra, were illegitimate.{{sfnp|Grant|1972|p=4}}{{sfnp|Roller|2010|p=165}}{{sfnp|Burstein|2004|pp=11, 69}} Cleopatra V (or VI) was expelled from the court of Ptolemy XII in late 69 BC, a few months after the birth of Cleopatra, while Ptolemy XII's three younger children were all born during the absence of his wife.{{sfnp|Roller|2010|pp=18\u201319}} The high degree of [[inbreeding]] among the Ptolemies is also illustrated by Cleopatra's immediate ancestry, of which a reconstruction is shown below.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"family tree\">The family tree and short discussions of the individuals can be found in {{harvtxt|Dodson|Hilton|2004|pp=268\u2013281}}.

Tallahassee is home to two of Florida's major public universities, [[Florida State University]] and [[Florida A&M University]], as well as [[Tallahassee Community College]]. Together these institutions have a combined enrollment of more than 70,000 students annually, creating both economic and social effects.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Leon County}}\nOriginally part of [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia]] and later [[Gadsden County, Florida|Gadsden County]], Leon County was created in 1824.<ref>{{cite book|title=Publications of the Florida Historical Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZQ-AAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA32|year=1908|publisher=Florida Historical Society.|page=32}}</ref> It was named after [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]], the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[List of explorers|explorer]] who was the first [[Europe]]an to reach Florida.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA185|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=185}}</ref>\n\nThe United States finally acquired this territory in the nineteenth century. In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955. Philanthropist Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee, which only served the black community, became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 9, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services, the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a [[bookmobile]] to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962, the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee had been desegregated by 1958, yet it would be several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's, Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989, \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955. Philanthropist Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee, which only served the black community, became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 9, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services, the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a [[bookmobile]] to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962, the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee had been desegregated by 1958, yet it would be several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's, Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

It uses a set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. With its strong scientific base, the IUCN Red List is recognized as the most authoritative guide to the status of biological diversity. A series of [[Regional Red List]]s are produced by countries or organizations, which assess the risk of extinction to species within a political management unit.\n\nThe IUCN Red List is set upon precise criteria to evaluate the [[extinction]] risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. The aim is to convey the urgency of conservation issues to the public and policy makers, as well as help the international community to try to reduce species extinction. According to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) (1996), the formally stated goals of the Red List are to provide scientifically based information on the status of species and subspecies at a global level, to draw attention to the magnitude and importance of threatened biodiversity, to influence national and international policy and decision-making, and to provide information to guide actions to conserve biological diversity.<ref>CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), Joint Meeting of the Animals and Plants Committees, Shepherdstown (United States of America), 7\u20139 December 2000, retrieved 14 November 2012</ref>\n\nMajor species assessors include [[BirdLife International]], the [[Institute of Zoology]] (the research division of the [[Zoological Society of London]]), the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]], and many Specialist Groups within the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission]] (SSC). Collectively, assessments by these organizations and groups account for nearly half the species on the Red List.\n\nThe IUCN aims to have the category of every species re-evaluated every five years if possible, or at least every ten years. This is done in a [[peer review]]ed manner through IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Specialist Groups, which are Red List Authorities responsible for a species, group of species or specific geographic area, or in the case of [[BirdLife International]], an entire class ([[Bird|Aves]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org//about/overview#redlist_authorities |title=Red List Overview |work=IUCN Red List |publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] |accessdate=20 June 2012 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630010436/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/overview#redlist_authorities |archivedate=30 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe number of species included on the Red List has been increasing over time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Thomas E.|author-link=Thomas Lovejoy|date=8 August 2017|title=Extinction tsunami can be avoided|journal=[[PNAS]]|volume=114|issue=32|pages=8840\u20138841|doi=10.1073/pnas.1711074114|pmc=5559057|pmid=28747527|doi-access=free}}</ref> As of 2019, of 105,000 species surveyed, 28,338 are considered at risk of extinction because of human activity, in particular a [[overfishing]], [[hunting]] and [[land development]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://time.com/5629548/almost-30000-species-face-extinction-new-report|title='The Numbers Are Just Horrendous.'

It uses a set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. With its strong scientific base, the IUCN Red List is recognized as the most authoritative guide to the status of biological diversity. A series of [[Regional Red List]]s are produced by countries or organizations, which assess the risk of extinction to species within a political management unit.\n\nThe IUCN Red List is set upon precise criteria to evaluate the [[extinction]] risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. The aim is to convey the urgency of conservation issues to the public and policy makers, as well as help the international community to try to reduce species extinction. According to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) (1996), the formally stated goals of the Red List are to provide scientifically based information on the status of species and subspecies at a global level, to draw attention to the magnitude and importance of threatened biodiversity, to influence national and international policy and decision-making, and to provide information to guide actions to conserve biological diversity.<ref>CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), Joint Meeting of the Animals and Plants Committees, Shepherdstown (United States of America), 7\u20139 December 2000, retrieved 14 November 2012</ref>\n\nMajor species assessors include [[BirdLife International]], the [[Institute of Zoology]] (the research division of the [[Zoological Society of London]]), the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]], and many Specialist Groups within the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission]] (SSC). Collectively, assessments by these organizations and groups account for nearly half the species on the Red List.\n\nThe IUCN aims to have the category of every species re-evaluated every five years if possible, or at least every ten years. This is done in a [[peer review]]ed manner through IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Specialist Groups, which are Red List Authorities responsible for a species, group of species or specific geographic area, or in the case of [[BirdLife International]], an entire class ([[Bird|Aves]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org//about/overview#redlist_authorities |title=Red List Overview |work=IUCN Red List |publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] |accessdate=20 June 2012 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630010436/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/overview#redlist_authorities |archivedate=30 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe number of species included on the Red List has been increasing over time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Thomas E.|author-link=Thomas Lovejoy|date=8 August 2017|title=Extinction tsunami can be avoided|journal=[[PNAS]]|volume=114|issue=32|pages=8840\u20138841|doi=10.1073/pnas.1711074114|pmc=5559057|pmid=28747527|doi-access=free}}</ref> As of 2019, of 105,000 species surveyed, 28,338 are considered at risk of extinction because of human activity, in particular [[overfishing]], [[hunting]] and [[land development]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://time.com/5629548/almost-30000-species-face-extinction-new-report|title='The Numbers Are Just Horrendous.'

The Red List includes the [[Sumatran orangutan]] (''Pongo abelii'') in the Critically Endangered category and the [[Bornean orangutan]] (''Pongo pygmaeus'') in the Endangered category.<ref>{{Cite press release|url=https://www.iucn.org/content/extinction-crisis-escalates-red-list-shows-apes-corals-vultures-dolphins-all-danger|title=Extinction crisis escalates: Red List shows apes, corals, vultures, dolphins all in danger|access-date=25 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124083212/http://www.iucn.org/media/materials/releases/?81%2FExtinction-crisis-escalates-Red-List-shows-apes-corals-vultures-dolphins-all-in-danger|archive-date=24 January 2011|url-status=live|date=12 September 2007|publisher=IUCN}}</ref>\n\n===2008 release===\nThe 2008 Red List was released on 6 October 2008 at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in [[Barcelona]] and \"confirmed an extinction crisis, with almost one in four [mammals] at risk of disappearing forever\".

{"title_page": "Access to information in South Africa", "text_new": "Offering citizens access to state-held information is \"one of the most effective ways of upholding the constitutional values of transparency, openness, participation and accountability.\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 94.</ref> Currie and De Waal suggest that accountability is unattainable if the government has a monopoly on the information that informs its actions and decisions. Access to information is not only fundamental to a properly-functioning [[participatory democracy]], it also increases public confidence in government and enhances its legitimacy. There are also, according to Cora Hoexter,\n\n<blockquote>many other benefits to be had. For instance, access to information discourages corruption, arbitrariness and other improper governmental conduct. It facilitates the protection of rights, something that is easily demonstrated in the area of administrative justice. Like reasons for administrative action, access to state-held information can be of enormous assistance to a person who suspects that her rights to administrative justice have been infringed and is in the process of building a case.<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 94-95.</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Constitutional right ==\nBefore the enactment of the interim Constitution there was no general right of access to information in South Africa. Considerable resources were directed instead towards maintaining secrecy in government. Many statutes contained provisions making it a criminal offence for officials to release information. The inclusion of a right of access to information in state hands was therefore \"an innovation of great significance\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 95.</ref> in the interim Constitution. Section 23 conferred on every person \"the right of access to all information held by the state or any of its organs at any level of government in so far as such information is required for the exercise or protection of any of his or her rights.\" In one of the earliest cases to deal with the right Jones J acknowledged its importance in these terms:\n\n<blockquote>The purpose of s 23 is to exclude the perpetuation of the old system of administration, a system in which it was possible for government to escape accountability by refusing to disclose information even if it had bearing upon the exercise or protection ofrights of the individual. This is the mischief it is designed to prevent [....] Demonstrable fairness and openness promotes public confidence in the administration of public affairs generally. This confidence is one of the characteristics of the democratically governed society for which the Constitution strives.</blockquote>\n\nThe right was soon being relied upon in various contexts, and a body of case law on section 23 developed rapidly. In particular, a number of cases were brought by accused persons who sought access to information contained in police dockets.\n\nToday section 32(1) of the Constitution confers on \"everyone\" a right of access to \"(a) any information held by the state; and (b) any information that is held by another person and that is required for the exercise or protection of any rights.\" Significantly, the first part of the right is far broader than was section 23 of the interim Constitution: The information no longer has to be required for the exercise or protection of rights.\n\nSection 32(1)(b) represents yet more innovation, as there was nothing to mirror it in section 23. The focus in this part of the right is not on governmental accountability but on a person\u2019s need for access to and control over information concerning himself. Such information will typically consist of medical or banking records, or the information in the personnel files of the person\u2019s employer. This aspect is closely related to the right to privacy. As Klaaren and Penfold indicate, having access to information about oneself can considerably enhance one's ability to protect rights such as privacy and equality. In addition, the ability to acquire knowledge about oneself is an aspect of \"self-actualization.\" Section 32(1)(b) is also significant as \"a guarantee that records passing into private hands as a result of privatisation processes will not be immune from access.\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 96.</ref>\n\nSection 32(2) required the enactment of national legislation to give effect to the right in section 32(1), and expressly allowed for \"reasonable measures to alleviate the administrative and financial burden on the state.\" The operation of s 32(1) was suspended pending the enactment of the legislation. In the interim, as with the rights to administrative justice, section 32(1) was to be read as if it were section 23 of the interim Constitution. During this period, then, it was not possible to assert the right to information held by \"another person.\"\n\n== Promotion of Access to Information Act ==\nThe [[Promotion of Access to Information Act]]<ref>Act 2 of 2000.</ref> (PAIA) was enacted in response to the constitutional mandate, and came into force in large part in March 2001. Its preamble acknowledges the \"secretive and unresponsive culture\" of the pre-democratic era, and asserts that one object of PAIA is to \"foster a culture of transparency and accountability in public and private bodies.\" In accordance with section 32, the Act provides for access to information held both by public and private entities. Though privacy features in the Act as a ground on which access may be refused, PAIA is \"not a typical privacy or data protection statute such as may be found in many other jurisdictions.\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 96.</ref> Its emphasis falls on facilitating access to information rather than protecting privacy.\n\nPAIA does not replace the constitutional right. Because, however, it purports to \"give effect to\" it, parties must generally assert the right via the Act. Thus the constitutional right is for the most part confined to the indirect role of informing the interpretation of the Act. It is possible to rely directly on section 32 only in exceptional cases, most obviously when the validity of the provisions of PAIA itself is being challenged. For example, it could be argued that the controversial blanket exemption of Cabinet records from the ambit of PAIA\u2014\"This Act does not apply to a record of [...] the Cabinet and its committees\"<ref>s 12(a).</ref>\u2014is \"an unconstitutional restriction of the scope of the right of access to 'information held by the state.'\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 97.</ref> Since the Cabinet is clearly part of \"the state,\" the exemption is a limitation of the right. Its validity would have to be decided by reference to the limitation clause in the Constitution.\n\nApart from general limitation of this kind, there is also a special limitation clause to consider. Section 32(2) permits the national legislation that gives effect to the constitutional right to \"provide for reasonable measures to alleviate the administrative and financial burden on the state.\" This language \"seems not to serve the function of demarcation but actually to grant the legislature additional scope to limit the right of access to information.\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 97.</ref> However, this scope is granted only to the extent that particular provisions of PAIA are designed to \"alleviate the administrative and financial burden on the state.\" The provision relating to fees \"would surely qualify,\" but the Cabinet exemption \"arguably would not,\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 97.</ref> and would thus not be justified by the special limitation.\n\nPAIA is applicable to a \"record\" any recorded information, regardless of form or medium, of a public body or private body, regardless of when the record came into existence. However, to keep the rules of discovery intact, the Act does not apply to records requested for the purpose of litigation where the request was made after the commencement of criminal or civil proceedings and access to the record \"is provided for in any other law.\"\n\n=== Access to state-held information ===\nAccess to records of public bodies is governed by Part 2 of the Act. A public body is defined in section 1 to include all departments of state or administration at the national, provincial and local levels, as well as any other functionary or institution acting in terms of a constitution or \"exercising a public power or performing a public function in terms of any legislation.\" However, in terms of section 12, the Act does not apply to a record of the Cabinet and its committees. Other exempted records are those relating to\n\n* the judicial functions of courts and certain other tribunals;\n* individual members of Parliament or provincial legislatures in that capacity; and\n* decisions of the Judicial Service Commission relating to nomination, selection or appointment.\n\nRequests for information are directed to the information officer of a public body. The information officer considers the request and notifies third parties where necessary. Section 11 states that a requester \"must\" be given access to a record of a public body if the procedural requirements of the Act have been met, and \"if access is not refused in terms of any ground for refusal.\" Unlike the position under the interim Constitution, there is no need for the requester to show that the information is in any way necessary for the exercise or protection of rights. For the most part, the public body will have to release the information if it relates to the requester. Limited provision is also made for the voluntary disclosure of information.\n\nThe claim that free access to official information is a prerequisite for public accountability and an essential feature of participatory democracy \"must be balanced against the legitimate need for secrecy in matters relating to defence, international relations and where information is personal or is held in confidence.\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 97.</ref> Chapter 4 of the PAIA lists a number of grounds on which access to requested information must or may be refused unless a public interest \"override\" applies. Some of the mandatory grounds protect the privacy of natural persons, records held by the South African Revenue Service, records privileged from production in legal proceedings and commercial information held by a third party. The latter covers trade secrets and other financial, commercial, scientific or technical information. Under section 23 of the interim Constitution, organs of state could be and were required to disclose tender documents to allow a competitor to determine whether its rights to just administrative action had been violated. Under PAIA, however, the state would be entitled to refuse a request for these records if they contained confidential commercial information.\n\nIn terms of PAIA, access to information must be refused if its disclosure \"could reasonably be expected to endanger\" the safety of an individual, and may be refused if its disclosure would be likely to impair the security of a building, a computer system, a means of transport or any system for protecting the public. Access may be refused to information that will reveal methods of investigating or prosecuting crime, or might otherwise prejudice a criminal investigation or prosecution. Information relating to the defence, security and international relations of the Republic need not be disclosed. Requests for information may be refused if disclosure is likely \"materially\" to jeopardise the financial welfare of the Republic or the ability of the government to manage the economy. A request may be refused where the record contains an opinion or report whose disclosure \"could reasonably be expected to frustrate the deliberative process in a public body or between public bodies.\" Requests that are \"manifestly frivolous or vexatious\" may also be refused.\n\nUnder section 81(3) of PAIA, the refusing party has to justify any refusal of access. This evidential burden was not discharged in ''[[President of the Republic of South Africa and Others v M & G Media Ltd]]'',<ref>2011 (2) SA 1 (SCA).</ref> which concerned a report by two senior judges who were asked by the President to visit Zimbabwe shortly before its presidential election in 2002. \"Surprisingly,\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 100.</ref> instead of confirming an order to release the report, a majority of the Constitutional Court resorted to section 80 of the Act and remitted the matter to the High Court for it to examine the report in secret and make a determination.\n\n=== Access to information in private hands ===\nPart 3 of PAIA gives effect to the right in section 32(1)(b) of the Constitution by providing in section 50 that a requester \"must be given access to any record of a private body\" if\n\n* the record is required for the exercise or protection of any rights;\n* the procedural requirements laid down in the Act have been complied with; and\n* access to the record is not refused on any of the grounds listed in Chapter 4 of Part 3.\n\nThe requirement relating to the protection of rights applied generally under the interim Constitution but is now confined to information held in private hands. \"Appropriately enough,\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 100.</ref> private bodies are thus subjected to a less stringent standard of transparency than public bodies: \"The private sector, in other words, is entitled to keep its information to itself, unless that information is needed to protect rights.\"<ref>Currie & De Waal 695.</ref> However, the private nature of a body is not the decisive factor. Section 8(1) of PAIA recognises that a body may be \"public\" or \"private\" for the purposes of the Act depending on whether the record in question \"relates to the exercise of a power or the performance of a function as a public body or as a private body.\" For instance, in ''[[IDASA v ANC]]'', where the applicants sought access to the donation records of certain political parties, the latter were judged to be private bodies in relation to those records.\n\n\"Significantly,\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 100.</ref> a \"requester\" is defined to include \"a public body or an official thereof,\" meaning that the state is entitled to access information in private hands. This innovation, \"rather controversial,\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 100.</ref> was \"clearly not required\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 100.</ref> by the terms of section 32 of the Constitution, but the objects of the Act listed in section 9 \"offer a justification for it.\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 100.</ref> Section 9(c) indicates that the purpose of the mechanism is \"to give effect to the constitutional obligations of the State of promoting a human rights culture and social justice.\"\n\nA private body is defined in section 1 of the Act to cover business entities, juristic persons and natural persons in their business or professional capacities. Typical examples of private bodies contemplated by the Act are banks and credit bureaux, which keep personal information about the income, banking history and credit rating of individuals\u2014the sort of records that easily qualify as \"required for the exercise or protection of any rights\" in terms of section 50(1)(a) of the Act.\n\nThere has been considerable debate in the cases as to what sort of \"rights\" are intended and in what sense the information must be \"required\" for their protection. Under the interim Constitution, at a time when the qualification applied to information held by the state and referred specifically to \"his or her rights,\" there was a natural concern to construe \"rights\" as broadly as possible. Thus in ''[[Van Niekerk v Pretoria City Council]]'' Cameron J suggested that the term should be interpreted to include not only rights in the Bill of Rights but also contractual and delictual rights against the state\u2014an approach supported by the Supreme Court of Appeal in ''[[Cape Metropolitan Council v Metro Inspection Services (Western Cape) CC]]''.\n\n\"Required\" can mean several things, ranging all the way from \"essential\" to merely \"relevant\" to the protection of rights. In ''[[Clutchco (Pty) Ltd v Davis]]'', the court surveyed the case law before holding that \"reasonably required,\" and not \"necessity,\" was the proper meaning, \"provided that it is understood to connote a substantial advantage or an element of need.\" While the test has been easily satisfied in some cases, the courts have applied it fairly rigorously in others. For instance, the test was not satisfied in ''[[Unitas Hospital v Van Wyk]]'', where the first respondent sought a report on nursing conditions in the hospital in order to build a case of negligence against it. Brand JA characterised the request as one for pre-action discovery and held that the use of section 50 of PAIA for this purpose \"must remain the exception rather than the rule.\" The difficulty in the ''[[IDASA]]'' case, on the other hand, was that the applicants were unable to show how the records of donations of certain political parties would assist them in exercising or protecting any of the rights on which they relied. As Griesel J saw it, they were really contending for a general principle of disclosure. They were \"pointing out, ''in general'', that this is desirable in any democracy and that it will be beneficial to openness, transparency and accountability.\"\n\n=== Protection of State Information Bill ===\nThe Protection of State Information Bill \"recalls apartheid-era legislation,\" the Protection of Information Act 84 of 1982, which is \"perhaps not inappropriate, for the Bill poses a serious challenge to the right of access to information [...] as well as to the \u2018principle of open justice\u2019 that has been identified and developed by the Constitutional Court in a series of cases.\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 102.</ref> Amongst other things, the Bill confers on organs of state very wide powers to classify and withhold information on security grounds and creates broadly-defined criminal offences that carry heavy penalties. \"There is widespread agreement amongst commentators that while new legislation is certainly needed to deal with sensitive information relating to national security, in its current incarnationever trust thisn the Bill is hopelessly flawed and unlikely to pass constitutional scrutiny.\"<ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Open access in South Africa]]\n\n== References ==\n* Holt, DH 1997, Management principles and practices, Prentice Hall, Sydney\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{South Africa topics}}\n[[Category:South African law]]\n", "text_old": "Offering citizens access to state-held information is \"one of the most effective ways of upholding the constitutional values of transparency, openness, participation and accountability.\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 94.</ref> Currie and De Waal suggest that accountability is unattainable if the government has a monopoly on the information that informs its actions and decisions. Access to information is not only fundamental to a properly-functioning [[participatory democracy]]; it also increases public confidence in government and enhances its legitimacy. There are also, according to Cora Hoexter,\n\n<blockquote>many other benefits to be had. For instance, access to information discourages corruption, arbitrariness and other improper governmental conduct. It facilitates the protection of rights, something that is easily demonstrated in the area of administrative justice. Like reasons for administrative action, access to state-held information can be of enormous assistance to a person who suspects that her rights to administrative justice have been infringed and is in the process of building a case.<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 94-95.</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Constitutional right ==\nBefore the enactment of the interim Constitution there was no general right of access to information in South Africa. Considerable resources were directed instead towards maintaining secrecy in government. Many statutes contained provisions making it a criminal offence for officials to release information. The inclusion of a right of access to information in state hands was therefore \"an innovation of great significance\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 95.</ref> in the interim Constitution. Section 23 conferred on every person \"the right of access to all information held by the state or any of its organs at any level of government in so far as such information is required for the exercise or protection of any of his or her rights.\" In one of the earliest cases to deal with the right Jones J acknowledged its importance in these terms:\n\n<blockquote>The purpose of s 23 is to exclude the perpetuation of the old system of administration, a system in which it was possible for government to escape accountability by refusing to disclose information even if it had bearing upon the exercise or protection ofrights of the individual. This is the mischief it is designed to prevent [....] Demonstrable fairness and openness promotes public confidence in the administration of public affairs generally. This confidence is one of the characteristics of the democratically governed society for which the Constitution strives.</blockquote>\n\nThe right was soon being relied upon in various contexts, and a body of case law on section 23 developed rapidly. In particular, a number of cases were brought by accused persons who sought access to information contained in police dockets.\n\nToday section 32(1) of the Constitution confers on \"everyone\" a right of access to \"(a) any information held by the state; and (b) any information that is held by another person and that is required for the exercise or protection of any rights.\" Significantly, the first part of the right is far broader than was section 23 of the interim Constitution: The information no longer has to be required for the exercise or protection of rights.\n\nSection 32(1)(b) represents yet more innovation, as there was nothing to mirror it in section 23. The focus in this part of the right is not on governmental accountability but on a person\u2019s need for access to and control over information concerning himself. Such information will typically consist of medical or banking records, or the information in the personnel files of the person\u2019s employer. This aspect is closely related to the right to privacy. As Klaaren and Penfold indicate, having access to information about oneself can considerably enhance one's ability to protect rights such as privacy and equality. In addition, the ability to acquire knowledge about oneself is an aspect of \"self-actualization.\" Section 32(1)(b) is also significant as \"a guarantee that records passing into private hands as a result of privatisation processes will not be immune from access.\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 96.</ref>\n\nSection 32(2) required the enactment of national legislation to give effect to the right in section 32(1), and expressly allowed for \"reasonable measures to alleviate the administrative and financial burden on the state.\" The operation of s 32(1) was suspended pending the enactment of the legislation. In the interim, as with the rights to administrative justice, section 32(1) was to be read as if it were section 23 of the interim Constitution. During this period, then, it was not possible to assert the right to information held by \"another person.\"\n\n== Promotion of Access to Information Act ==\nThe Promotion of Access to Information Act<ref>Act 2 of 2000.</ref> (PAIA) was enacted in response to the constitutional mandate, and came into force in large part in March 2001. Its preamble acknowledges the \"secretive and unresponsive culture\" of the pre-democratic era, and asserts that one object of PAIA is to \"foster a culture of transparency and accountability in public and private bodies.\" In accordance with section 32, the Act provides for access to information held both by public and private entities. Though privacy features in the Act as a ground on which access may be refused, PAIA is \"not a typical privacy or data protection statute such as may be found in many other jurisdictions.\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 96.</ref> Its emphasis falls on facilitating access to information rather than protecting privacy.\n\nPAIA does not replace the constitutional right. Because, however, it purports to \"give effect to\" it, parties must generally assert the right via the Act. Thus the constitutional right is for the most part confined to the indirect role of informing the interpretation of the Act. It is possible to rely directly on section 32 only in exceptional cases, most obviously when the validity of the provisions of PAIA itself is being challenged. For example, it could be argued that the controversial blanket exemption of Cabinet records from the ambit of PAIA\u2014\"This Act does not apply to a record of [...] the Cabinet and its committees\"<ref>s 12(a).</ref>\u2014is \"an unconstitutional restriction of the scope of the right of access to 'information held by the state.'\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 97.</ref> Since the Cabinet is clearly part of \"the state,\" the exemption is a limitation of the right. Its validity would have to be decided by reference to the limitation clause in the Constitution.\n\nApart from general limitation of this kind, there is also a special limitation clause to consider. Section 32(2) permits the national legislation that gives effect to the constitutional right to \"provide for reasonable measures to alleviate the administrative and financial burden on the state.\" This language \"seems not to serve the function of demarcation but actually to grant the legislature additional scope to limit the right of access to information.\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 97.</ref> However, this scope is granted only to the extent that particular provisions of PAIA are designed to \"alleviate the administrative and financial burden on the state.\" The provision relating to fees \"would surely qualify,\" but the Cabinet exemption \"arguably would not,\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 97.</ref> and would thus not be justified by the special limitation.\n\nPAIA is applicable to a \"record\" any recorded information, regardless of form or medium, of a public body or private body, regardless of when the record came into existence. However, to keep the rules of discovery intact, the Act does not apply to records requested for the purpose of litigation where the request was made after the commencement of criminal or civil proceedings and access to the record \"is provided for in any other law.\"\n\n=== Access to state-held information ===\nAccess to records of public bodies is governed by Part 2 of the Act. A public body is defined in section 1 to include all departments of state or administration at the national, provincial and local levels, as well as any other functionary or institution acting in terms of a constitution or \"exercising a public power or performing a public function in terms of any legislation.\" However, in terms of section 12, the Act does not apply to a record of the Cabinet and its committees. Other exempted records are those relating to\n\n* the judicial functions of courts and certain other tribunals;\n* individual members of Parliament or provincial legislatures in that capacity; and\n* decisions of the Judicial Service Commission relating to nomination, selection or appointment.\n\nRequests for information are directed to the information officer of a public body. The information officer considers the request and notifies third parties where necessary. Section 11 states that a requester \"must\" be given access to a record of a public body if the procedural requirements of the Act have been met, and \"if access is not refused in terms of any ground for refusal.\" Unlike the position under the interim Constitution, there is no need for the requester to show that the information is in any way necessary for the exercise or protection of rights. For the most part, the public body will have to release the information if it relates to the requester. Limited provision is also made for the voluntary disclosure of information.\n\nThe claim that free access to official information is a prerequisite for public accountability and an essential feature of participatory democracy \"must be balanced against the legitimate need for secrecy in matters relating to defence, international relations and where information is personal or is held in confidence.\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 97.</ref> Chapter 4 of the PAIA lists a number of grounds on which access to requested information must or may be refused unless a public interest \"override\" applies. Some of the mandatory grounds protect the privacy of natural persons, records held by the South African Revenue Service, records privileged from production in legal proceedings and commercial information held by a third party. The latter covers trade secrets and other financial, commercial, scientific or technical information. Under section 23 of the interim Constitution, organs of state could be and were required to disclose tender documents to allow a competitor to determine whether its rights to just administrative action had been violated. Under PAIA, however, the state would be entitled to refuse a request for these records if they contained confidential commercial information.\n\nIn terms of PAIA, access to information must be refused if its disclosure \"could reasonably be expected to endanger\" the safety of an individual, and may be refused if its disclosure would be likely to impair the security of a building, a computer system, a means of transport or any system for protecting the public. Access may be refused to information that will reveal methods of investigating or prosecuting crime, or might otherwise prejudice a criminal investigation or prosecution. Information relating to the defence, security and international relations of the Republic need not be disclosed. Requests for information may be refused if disclosure is likely \"materially\" to jeopardise the financial welfare of the Republic or the ability of the government to manage the economy. A request may be refused where the record contains an opinion or report whose disclosure \"could reasonably be expected to frustrate the deliberative process in a public body or between public bodies.\" Requests that are \"manifestly frivolous or vexatious\" may also be refused.\n\nUnder section 81(3) of PAIA, the refusing party has to justify any refusal of access. This evidential burden was not discharged in ''[[President of the Republic of South Africa and Others v M & G Media Ltd]]'',<ref>2011 (2) SA 1 (SCA).</ref> which concerned a report by two senior judges who were asked by the President to visit Zimbabwe shortly before its presidential election in 2002. \"Surprisingly,\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 100.</ref> instead of confirming an order to release the report, a majority of the Constitutional Court resorted to section 80 of the Act and remitted the matter to the High Court for it to examine the report in secret and make a determination.\n\n=== Access to information in private hands ===\nPart 3 of PAIA gives effect to the right in section 32(1)(b) of the Constitution by providing in section 50 that a requester \"must be given access to any record of a private body\" if\n\n* the record is required for the exercise or protection of any rights;\n* the procedural requirements laid down in the Act have been complied with; and\n* access to the record is not refused on any of the grounds listed in Chapter 4 of Part 3.\n\nThe requirement relating to the protection of rights applied generally under the interim Constitution but is now confined to information held in private hands. \"Appropriately enough,\"<ref>Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 100.</ref> private bodies are thus subjected to a less stringent standard of transparency than public bodies: \"The private sector, in other words, is entitled to keep its information to itself, unless that information is needed to protect rights.\"<ref>Currie & De Waal 695.</ref> However, the private nature of a body is not the decisive factor.

It was founded on May 28, 1892, in [[San Francisco, California]], by the Scottish-American preservationist [[John Muir]], who became its first president. The Sierra Club primarily operates in the United States; an affiliated organization, [[Sierra Club Canada]], operates in Canada and deals exclusively with Canadian issues.\n\nTraditionally associated with the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]], the club was one of the first large-scale environmental preservation organizations in the world, and currently engages in lobbying politicians to promote environmentalist policies. Recent focuses of the club include promoting [[sustainable energy]], mitigating [[global warming]], and [[Beyond Coal|opposing the use of coal]]. The club is known for its political endorsements, which are often sought after by candidates in local elections; it generally supports [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and progressive candidates in elections.\n\nThe Sierra Club is organized on both a national and local level. The club is divided into large chapters representing large geographic areas, some of which have tens of thousands of members. These chapters are divided into regional groups, and special interest sections, committees, and task forces. While much activity is coordinated at a local level, the Club is a unified organization; decisions made at the national level take precedence.\n\nIn addition to political advocacy, the Sierra Club organizes outdoor recreation activities, and has historically been a notable organization for [[mountaineering]] and [[rock climbing]] in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sierraclub.org/about-sierra-club|title=About the Sierra Club|date=2018-10-06|website=Sierra Club|language=en|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref> Members of the Sierra Club pioneered the [[Yosemite Decimal System]] of climbing, and were responsible for a substantial amount of the early development of climbing. Much of this activity occurred in the group's namesake [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. The Sierra Club does not set standards for or regulate alpinism, but it organizes wilderness courses, hikes, and occasional alpine expeditions for members. In [[California]], the club, through its outdoor recreation groups, is usually considered the state's analogue to other state mountaineering clubs such as [[Mazamas]] or the [[Colorado Mountain Club]].\n\n== Overview==\nThe Sierra Club's stated mission is \"To explore, enjoy, and protect the wild places of the earth; To practice and promote the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; To educate and enlist humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment; and to use all lawful means to carry out these objectives.\"<ref name=mission>{{cite web|title=Policies|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/policy|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Sierra Club is governed by a 15-member [[Board of Directors]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/board|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref> Each year, five directors are elected to three-year terms, and all club members are eligible to vote. A president is elected annually by the Board from among its members. The [[Executive Director]] runs the day-to-day operations of the group.

Richard M. Skinner of the [[Brookings Institution]] describes the Sierra Club as one of the United States' \"leading environmental organizations\". The Sierra Club makes endorsements of individual candidates for elected office, which has substantial weight given the club's reputation and large membership.<ref name=\"Skinner2007\">{{cite book|author=Richard M.

This campaign succeeded in 1890. As early as 1889, Johnson had encouraged Muir to form an \"association\" to help protect the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and preliminary meetings were held to plan the group. Others involved in the early planning included artist [[William Keith (artist)|William Keith]], [[Willis Linn Jepson]], [[Willard Drake Johnson]], [[Joseph LeConte]] and [[David Starr Jordan]].\n\nIn May 1892, a group of professors from the [[University of California at Berkeley|University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Stanford University]] helped Muir and attorney [[Warren Olney]] launch the new organization modeled after the eastern [[Appalachian Mountain Club]]. The Sierra Club's charter members elected Muir president, an office he held until his death in 1914.<ref name=history>Michael P.

The Sierra Club won its first lobbying victory with the creation of the country's second national park, after [[Yellowstone]] in 1872.<ref name=legacy>Stephen Fox, ''John Muir and His Legacy: The American Conservation Movement (Boston: Little, Brown, 1981), pp. 125\u2013319.</ref>\n\n=== Hetch Hetchy controversy ===\n[[File:Theodore-Roosevelt-and-John-Muir 1906.jpg|thumb|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[John Muir]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], c. 1906]]\n\nIn the first decade of the 1900s, the Sierra Club became embroiled in the  [[Hetch Hetchy Reservoir]] controversy that divided preservationists from \"resource management\" conservationists. In the late 19th century, the city of San Francisco was rapidly outgrowing its limited water supply, which depended on intermittent local springs and streams. In 1890, San Francisco mayor [[James D. Phelan]] proposed to build a dam and aqueduct on the Tuolumne River, one of the largest southern Sierra rivers, as a way to increase and stabilize the city's water supply.<ref name=\"controversy\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www1.assumption.edu/users/mcclymer/His130/P-H/hetch%20hetchy/default.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041230222555/http://www.assumption.edu/users/mcclymer/His130/P-H/hetch%20hetchy/default.html\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 2004-12-30\n |title      = The Hetch Hetchy Dam Controversy: An Introduction\n |publisher  = Assumption College\n |accessdate = 2013-05-25\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Gifford Pinchot]], a progressive supporter of public utilities and head of the [[US Forest Service]], which then had jurisdiction over the national parks, supported the creation of the Hetch Hetchy dam. Muir appealed to his friend U.S. President Roosevelt, who would not commit himself against the dam, given its popularity with the people of San Francisco (a [[referendum]] in 1908 confirmed a seven-to-one majority in favor of the dam and municipal water). Muir and attorney [[William Edward Colby]] began a national campaign against the dam, attracting the support of many eastern conservationists. With the 1912 election of U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who carried San Francisco, supporters of the dam had a friend in the White House.\n\nThe bill to dam Hetch Hetchy passed Congress in 1913, and so the Sierra Club lost its first major battle. In retaliation, the Club supported creation of the [[National Park Service]] in 1916, to remove the parks from Forest Service oversight. [[Stephen Mather]], a Club member from Chicago and an opponent of the Hetch Hetchy dam, became the first National Park Service director.<ref name=legacy />\n\n=== 1920s\u201340s ===\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the Sierra Club functioned as a social and recreational society, conducting outings, maintaining trails and building huts and lodges in the Sierras. Preservation campaigns included a several-year effort to enlarge [[Sequoia National Park]] (achieved in 1926) and over three decades of work to protect and then preserve [[Kings Canyon National Park]] (established in 1940). Historian Stephen Fox notes, \"In the 1930s most of the three thousand members were middle-aged Republicans.\"<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe [[New Deal]] brought many conservationists to the Democratic Party, and many Democrats entered the ranks of conservationists. Leading the generation of [[Young Turks (U.S. politics)|Young Turks]] who revitalized the Sierra Club after World War II were attorneys [[Richard M. Leonard|Richard Leonard]] and [[Bestor Robinson]], nature photographer [[Ansel Adams]], and [[David Brower]].\n\nAdams sponsored Brower for membership in the Club, and he was appointed to the editorial board of the ''Sierra Club Bulletin.'' After [[World War II]] Brower returned to his job with the University of California Press, and began editing the ''Sierra Club Bulletin'' in 1946.<ref name=legacy />\n\n===National reach===\n\nIn 1950, the Sierra Club had some 7,000 members, mostly on the West Coast. That year the Atlantic chapter became the first formed outside California. An active volunteer board of directors ran the organization, assisted by a small clerical staff. Brower was appointed the first executive director in 1952, and the Club began to catch up with major conservation organizations such as the [[National Audubon Society]], [[National Wildlife Federation]], [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]], and [[Izaak Walton League]], which had long had professional staff.<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe Sierra Club secured its national reputation in the battle against the [[Echo Park Dam]] in [[Dinosaur National Monument]] in [[Utah]], which had been announced by the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] in 1950. Brower led the fight, marshaling support from other conservation groups. Brower's background in publishing proved decisive; with the help of publisher Alfred Knopf, ''This Is Dinosaur'' was rushed into press. Invoking the specter of Hetch Hetchy, conservationists effectively lobbied Congress, which deleted the Echo Park dam from the [[Colorado River]] project as approved in 1955. Recognition of the Sierra Club's role in the Echo Park dam victory boosted membership from 10,000 in 1956 to 15,000 in 1960.<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe Sierra Club was now truly a national conservation organization, and preservationists took the offensive with wilderness proposals. The Club's Biennial Wilderness Conferences, launched in 1949 in concert with The Wilderness Society, became an important force in the campaign that secured passage of the [[Wilderness Act]] in 1964.<ref name=legacy />\n\n=== Book series ===\n\nIn 1960, Brower launched the Exhibit Format book series with ''This Is the American Earth'', and in 1962 ''In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World'', with color photographs by [[Eliot Porter]]. These coffee-table books, published by their [[Sierra Club Books]] division, introduced the Sierra Club to a wider audience. Fifty thousand copies were sold in the first four years, and by 1960 sales exceeded $10 million. Soon Brower was publishing two new titles a year in the Exhibit Format series, but not all did as well as ''In Wildness.'' Although the books were successful in introducing the public to wilderness preservation and the Sierra Club, they lost money for the organization, some $60,000 a year after 1964. Financial management became a matter of contention between Brower and his board of directors.<ref name=legacy/>\n\n=== Grand Canyon campaign ===\n\nThe Sierra Club's most publicized crusade of the 1960s was the effort to stop the Bureau of Reclamation from building two dams that would flood portions of the [[Grand Canyon]]. Opposing the [[Bridge Canyon Dam|Bridge Canyon]] and [[Marble Canyon Dam|Marble Canyon]] dam projects, full-page ads the Club placed in the ''New York Times'' and the ''Washington Post'' in 1966 exclaimed, \"This time it's the Grand Canyon they want to flood,\" and asked, \"Should we also flood the Sistine Chapel so tourists can get nearer the ceiling?\" The ads generated a storm of protest to the Congress, prompting the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to announce it was suspending the Sierra Club's [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] status pending an investigation. The board had taken the precaution of setting up the [[Sierra Club Foundation]] as a (c)(3) organization in 1960 for endowments and contributions for educational and other non-lobbying activities.<ref name=history/> Even so, contributions to the Club dropped off, aggravating its annual operating deficits. Membership, however, climbed sharply in response to the investigation into the legitimacy of the society's tax status by the IRS from 30,000 in 1965 to 57,000 in 1967 and 75,000 in 1969.\n\nThe victory over the dam projects and challenges from the IRS did not come without costs. To make up for the power that would have been produced by the dams, the Sierra Club actually advocated for coal power plants. The result of the campaign and its trade-off was, in the words of historian Andrew Needham, that \"the Grand Canyon became protected, sacred space,\" while \"the Navajo Reservation\"\u2014which housed some of the main power plants picking up the slack \u2013 \"became increasingly industrial.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Power Lines: Phoenix and the Making of the Modern Southwest|last = Needham|first = Andrew|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 9781400852406|location = Princeton, NJ|pages = 211}}</ref>\n\n=== End of the Brower era ===\n\nDespite the Club's success in blocking plans for the Grand Canyon dams and weathering the transition from 501(c)(3) to [[501(c)#501(c)(4)|501(c)(4)]] status, tension grew over finances between Brower and the board of directors. The Club's annual deficits rose from $100,000 in 1967 and 1968 to some $200,000 in 1969. Another conflict occurred over the Club's policy toward the nuclear power plant to be constructed by [[Pacific Gas and Electric]] (PG&E) at [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant|Diablo Canyon]] near [[San Luis Obispo, California]]. Although the Club had played the leading role blocking PG&E's nuclear power plant proposed for [[Bodega Bay, California]] in the early 1960s, that case had been built around the local environmental impact and earthquake danger from the nearby [[San Andreas fault]], not from opposition to nuclear power itself. In exchange for moving the new proposed site from the environmentally sensitive Nipomo Dunes to Diablo Canyon, the board of directors voted to support PG&E's plan for the power plant. A membership referendum in 1967 upheld the board's decision. But Brower concluded that nuclear power at any location was a mistake, and he voiced his opposition to the plant, contrary to the Club's official policy. As pro- and anti-Brower factions polarized, the annual election of new directors reflected the conflict. Brower's supporters won a majority in 1968, but in the April 1969 election the anti-Brower candidates won all five open positions. Ansel Adams and president Richard Leonard, two of his closest friends on the board, led the opposition to Brower, charging him with financial recklessness and insubordination and calling for his ouster as executive director. The board voted ten to five to accept Brower's resignation.<ref name=history/> Eventually reconciled with the Club, Brower was elected to the board of directors for a term from 1983 to 1988, and again from 1995 to 2000.\n\n=== McCloskey years ===\n\nMichael McCloskey, hired by Brower in 1961 as the Club's first northwest field representative, became the Club's second executive director in 1969. An administrator attentive to detail, McCloskey had set up the Club's conservation department in 1965 and guided the campaigns to save the Grand Canyon and establish [[Redwoods National Park]] and [[North Cascades National Park]]. During the 1970s, McCloskey led the Club's legislative activity\u2014preserving [[Alaska]]n lands and eastern wilderness areas, and supporting the new environmental agenda: the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] of 1976, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] amendments, and the [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act]] of 1977, passed during the administration of President [[Jimmy Carter]]. The Sierra Club made its first presidential endorsement in 1984 in support of [[Walter Mondale]]'s unsuccessful campaign to unseat [[Ronald Reagan]]. McCloskey resigned as executive director in 1985 after 16-1/2 years (the same length of time Brower had led the organization), and assumed the title of chairman, becoming the Club's senior strategist, devoting his time to conservation policy rather than budget planning and administration.<ref>Michael McCloskey, ''In the Thick of It: My Life in the Sierra Club'' (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2000), pp. 99\u2013248.</ref> After a two-year interlude with Douglas Wheeler, whose Republican credentials were disconcerting to liberal members, the Club hired Michael Fischer, the former head of the [[California Coastal Commission]], who served as executive director from 1987 to 1992. [[Carl Pope (environmentalist)|Carl Pope]], formerly the Club's legislative director, was named executive director in 1992.\n\n=== Lobbying within the club ===\n\nIn the 1990s, club members Jim Bensman, Roger Clarke, David Dilworth, Chad Hanson and David Orr along with about 2,000 members formed the John Muir Sierrans (JMS), an internal caucus, to promote changes to club positions. They favored a zero-cut forest policy on public lands and, a few years later, decommissioning Glen Canyon Dam. JMS was successful in changing club positions on both counts.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Broydo|first1=Leora|title=Mutiny at the Sierra Club|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1998/11/mutiny-sierra-club|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Mother Jones|date=November 3, 1998}}</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2008, several Sierra Club officers quit in protest after the Sierra Club agreed to promote products by [[Clorox]], which had been named one of a \"dangerous dozen\" chemical companies by the [[Public Interest Research Group]] in 2004.

The annual [[High Trips]] were led by [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]]  such as [[Francis P. Farquhar]], [[Joseph Nisbet LeConte]], [[Norman Clyde]], [[Walter A. Starr, Jr.]], [[Jules Eichorn]], [[Glen Dawson (mountaineer)|Glen Dawson]], [[Ansel Adams]], and [[David R. Brower]]. A number of [[first ascent]]s  in the Sierra Nevada were made on Sierra Club outings. Sierra Club members were also early enthusiasts of rock climbing. In 1911, the first chapter was formed, Angeles, and it began conducting local excursions in the mountains surrounding [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and throughout the West.\n\nMany major innovations in mountaineering have come from Sierra Club members. [[Norman Clyde]] and [[Jules Eichorn]], considered among the most famous members of the club, completed many first ascents of peaks in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].\n\n[[Glen Dawson (mountaineer)|Glen Dawson]] and [[Royal Robbins]], often on trips sponsored and organized by the Rock Climbing Section of the Angeles Chapter, opened up much of the [[Tahquitz Peak]] area to climbing, which at the time was said to contain some of the hardest routes in the world. The [[Yosemite Decimal System]], the primary method of rating a route's difficulty used in the United States, was developed into its modern form at Tahquitz.\n\n[[Steve Roper]]'s ''[[Fifty Classic Climbs of North America]]'', sponsored and published by the Sierra Club, is still considered one of the definitive rock climbing guidebooks in the United States.\n\nDue to an increasing focus on political activity and concerns about financial liability, mountaineering activity in the Sierra Club has subsided since the 1980s. Some chapters, mostly in California, continue to maintain large mountaineering programs.\n\nThe club currently occasionally awards the [[Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award]] to outstanding member mountaineers.\n\n===Hiking and Outings===\nIn [[World War II]], a number of Sierra Club leaders joined the [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]].<ref name=\"http://sierraclub.org/outings\">{{cite web|url=http://sierraclub.org/outings/ |title=Outings |publisher=Sierra Club |accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref> Among them was [[David R.

Ehrlich|Anne]],<ref name=monitor/> wanted to take the Club into the contentious field of [[immigration to the United States]]. The Club's position was that [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] was a significant factor in the degradation of the environment. Accordingly, the Club supported stabilizing and reducing U.S. and world population. Some members argued that, as a practical matter, U.S. population could not be stabilized, let alone reduced, at the then-current levels of immigration. They urged the Club to support [[immigration reduction]]. The Club had previously addressed the issue of \"mass immigration\",<ref>\"[http://www.susps.org/history/scpolicy.html#ihist Sierra Club Policy: Immigration Policy History].\" SUSPS. Accessed 14 May 2008.</ref> and in 1988, the organization's Population Committee and Conservation Coordinating Committee stated that immigration to the U.S. should be limited, so as to achieve population stabilization.<ref>Kunofsky, Judy. \"[http://www.susps.org/history/popreport1989.html Sierra Club, U.S. Population Growth, and Immigration].\" ''Sierra Club Population Report''.

In the mid 1990s, the club began gradually stepping away from the immigration restrictionist position, culminating with the board adopting a neutral position on immigration policy in 1996.<ref>Davila, Florangela (February&nbsp;18, 2004). \"[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20040218&slug=sierra18m Immigration dispute spawns factions, anger in Sierra Club]\".

It was founded on May 28, 1892, in [[San Francisco, California]], by the Scottish-American preservationist [[John Muir]], who became its first president. The Sierra Club primarily operates in the United States; an affiliated organization, [[Sierra Club Canada]], operates in Canada and deals exclusively with Canadian issues.\n\nTraditionally associated with the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]], the club was one of the first large-scale environmental preservation organizations in the world, and currently engages in lobbying politicians to promote environmentalist policies. Recent focuses of the club include promoting [[sustainable energy]], mitigating [[global warming]], and [[Beyond Coal|opposing the use of coal]]. The club is known for its political endorsements, which are often sought after by candidates in local elections; it generally supports [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and progressive candidates in elections.\n\nThe Sierra Club is organized on both a national and local level. The club is divided into large chapters representing large geographic areas, some of which have tens of thousands of members. These chapters are divided into regional groups, and special interest sections, committees, and task forces. While much activity is coordinated at a local level, the Club is a unified organization; decisions made at the national level take precedence.\n\nIn addition to political advocacy, the Sierra Club organizes outdoor recreation activities, and has historically been a notable organization for [[mountaineering]] and [[rock climbing]] in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sierraclub.org/about-sierra-club|title=About the Sierra Club|date=2018-10-06|website=Sierra Club|language=en|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref> Members of the Sierra Club pioneered the [[Yosemite Decimal System]] of climbing, and were responsible for a substantial amount of the early development of climbing. Much of this activity occurred in the group's namesake [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. The Sierra Club does not set standards for or regulate alpinism, but it organizes wilderness courses, hikes, and occasional alpine expeditions for members. In [[California]], the club, through its outdoor recreation groups, is usually considered the state's analogue to other state mountaineering clubs such as [[Mazamas]] or the [[Colorado Mountain Club]].\n\n== Overview==\nThe Sierra Club's stated mission is \"To explore, enjoy, and protect the wild places of the earth; To practice and promote the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; To educate and enlist humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment; and to use all lawful means to carry out these objectives.\"<ref name=mission>{{cite web|title=Policies|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/policy|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Sierra Club is governed by a 15-member [[Board of Directors]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/board|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref> Each year, five directors are elected to three-year terms, and all club members are eligible to vote. A president is elected annually by the Board from among its members. The [[Executive Director]] runs the day-to-day operations of the group. [[Michael Brune]], formerly of [[Rainforest Action Network]], has served as the organization's executive director since 2010.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Carl Pope to Step Down as Executive Director of Sierra Club |publisher=Sierra Club |date=January 20, 2010 |url=http://action.sierraclub.org/site/MessageViewer?em_id=154481.0|accessdate=2010-01-20}}</ref> Brune succeeded [[Carl Pope (environmentalist)|Carl Pope]].

National and local special-interest sections, committees, and task forces address particular issues. The national Sierra Club sets the organization's policy agenda and overarching rules.<ref name=mission/>\n\nThe club is known for engaging in two main activities: promoting and guiding outdoor recreational activities, which is done throughout the United States but primarily in California (especially Southern California), and political activism to promote environmental causes. Richard M. Skinner of the [[Brookings Institution]] describes the Sierra Club as one of the United States' \"leading environmental organizations\". The Sierra Club makes endorsements of individual candidates for elected office, which has substantial weight given the club's reputation and large membership.<ref name=\"Skinner2007\">{{cite book|author=Richard M.

This campaign succeeded in 1890. As early as 1889, Johnson had encouraged Muir to form an \"association\" to help protect the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and preliminary meetings were held to plan the group. Others involved in the early planning included artist [[William Keith (artist)|William Keith]], [[Willis Linn Jepson]], [[Willard Drake Johnson]], [[Joseph LeConte]] and [[David Starr Jordan]].\n\nIn May 1892, a group of professors from the [[University of California at Berkeley|University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Stanford University]] helped Muir and attorney [[Warren Olney]] launch the new organization modeled after the eastern [[Appalachian Mountain Club]]. The Sierra Club's charter members elected Muir president, an office he held until his death in 1914.<ref name=history>Michael P. Cohen, ''The History of the Sierra Club, 1892\u20131970'' (San Francisco: Sierra Club Books, 1988)</ref>\n\nThe Club's first goals included establishing [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier]] and [[Mount Rainier National Park|Mount Rainier]] national parks, convincing the California legislature to give [[Yosemite Valley]] to the U.S. federal government, and preserving California's coastal [[Coast Redwood|redwood]]s.\n\nMuir escorted President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] through Yosemite in 1903, and two years later the California legislature ceded Yosemite Valley and [[Mariposa Grove]] to the federal government. The Sierra Club won its first lobbying victory with the creation of the country's second national park, after [[Yellowstone]] in 1872.<ref name=legacy>Stephen Fox, ''John Muir and His Legacy: The American Conservation Movement (Boston: Little, Brown, 1981), pp. 125\u2013319.</ref>\n\n=== Hetch Hetchy controversy ===\n[[File:Theodore-Roosevelt-and-John-Muir 1906.jpg|thumb|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[John Muir]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], c. 1906]]\n\nIn the first decade of the 1900s, the Sierra Club became embroiled in the  [[Hetch Hetchy Reservoir]] controversy that divided preservationists from \"resource management\" conservationists. In the late 19th century, the city of San Francisco was rapidly outgrowing its limited water supply, which depended on intermittent local springs and streams. In 1890, San Francisco mayor [[James D. Phelan]] proposed to build a dam and aqueduct on the Tuolumne River, one of the largest southern Sierra rivers, as a way to increase and stabilize the city's water supply.<ref name=\"controversy\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www1.assumption.edu/users/mcclymer/His130/P-H/hetch%20hetchy/default.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041230222555/http://www.assumption.edu/users/mcclymer/His130/P-H/hetch%20hetchy/default.html\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 2004-12-30\n |title      = The Hetch Hetchy Dam Controversy: An Introduction\n |publisher  = Assumption College\n |accessdate = 2013-05-25\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Gifford Pinchot]], a progressive supporter of public utilities and head of the [[US Forest Service]], which then had jurisdiction over the national parks, supported the creation of the Hetch Hetchy dam. Muir appealed to his friend U.S. President Roosevelt, who would not commit himself against the dam, given its popularity with the people of San Francisco (a [[referendum]] in 1908 confirmed a seven-to-one majority in favor of the dam and municipal water). Muir and attorney [[William Edward Colby]] began a national campaign against the dam, attracting the support of many eastern conservationists. With the 1912 election of U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who carried San Francisco, supporters of the dam had a friend in the White House.\n\nThe bill to dam Hetch Hetchy passed Congress in 1913, and so the Sierra Club lost its first major battle. In retaliation, the Club supported creation of the [[National Park Service]] in 1916, to remove the parks from Forest Service oversight. [[Stephen Mather]], a Club member from Chicago and an opponent of the Hetch Hetchy dam, became the first National Park Service director.<ref name=legacy />\n\n=== 1920s\u201340s ===\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the Sierra Club functioned as a social and recreational society, conducting outings, maintaining trails and building huts and lodges in the Sierras. Preservation campaigns included a several-year effort to enlarge [[Sequoia National Park]] (achieved in 1926) and over three decades of work to protect and then preserve [[Kings Canyon National Park]] (established in 1940). Historian Stephen Fox notes, \"In the 1930s most of the three thousand members were middle-aged Republicans.\"<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe [[New Deal]] brought many conservationists to the Democratic Party, and many Democrats entered the ranks of conservationists. Leading the generation of [[Young Turks (U.S. politics)|Young Turks]] who revitalized the Sierra Club after World War II were attorneys [[Richard M. Leonard|Richard Leonard]] and [[Bestor Robinson]], nature photographer [[Ansel Adams]], and [[David Brower]].\n\nAdams sponsored Brower for membership in the Club, and he was appointed to the editorial board of the ''Sierra Club Bulletin.'' After [[World War II]] Brower returned to his job with the University of California Press, and began editing the ''Sierra Club Bulletin'' in 1946.<ref name=legacy />\n\n===National reach===\n\nIn 1950, the Sierra Club had some 7,000 members, mostly on the West Coast. That year the Atlantic chapter became the first formed outside California. An active volunteer board of directors ran the organization, assisted by a small clerical staff. Brower was appointed the first executive director in 1952, and the Club began to catch up with major conservation organizations such as the [[National Audubon Society]], [[National Wildlife Federation]], [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]], and [[Izaak Walton League]], which had long had professional staff.<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe Sierra Club secured its national reputation in the battle against the [[Echo Park Dam]] in [[Dinosaur National Monument]] in [[Utah]], which had been announced by the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] in 1950. Brower led the fight, marshaling support from other conservation groups. Brower's background in publishing proved decisive; with the help of publisher Alfred Knopf, ''This Is Dinosaur'' was rushed into press. Invoking the specter of Hetch Hetchy, conservationists effectively lobbied Congress, which deleted the Echo Park dam from the [[Colorado River]] project as approved in 1955. Recognition of the Sierra Club's role in the Echo Park dam victory boosted membership from 10,000 in 1956 to 15,000 in 1960.<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe Sierra Club was now truly a national conservation organization, and preservationists took the offensive with wilderness proposals. The Club's Biennial Wilderness Conferences, launched in 1949 in concert with The Wilderness Society, became an important force in the campaign that secured passage of the [[Wilderness Act]] in 1964.<ref name=legacy />\n\n=== Book series ===\n\nIn 1960, Brower launched the Exhibit Format book series with ''This Is the American Earth'', and in 1962 ''In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World'', with color photographs by [[Eliot Porter]]. These coffee-table books, published by their [[Sierra Club Books]] division, introduced the Sierra Club to a wider audience. Fifty thousand copies were sold in the first four years, and by 1960 sales exceeded $10 million. Soon Brower was publishing two new titles a year in the Exhibit Format series, but not all did as well as ''In Wildness.'' Although the books were successful in introducing the public to wilderness preservation and the Sierra Club, they lost money for the organization, some $60,000 a year after 1964. Financial management became a matter of contention between Brower and his board of directors.<ref name=legacy/>\n\n=== Grand Canyon campaign ===\n\nThe Sierra Club's most publicized crusade of the 1960s was the effort to stop the Bureau of Reclamation from building two dams that would flood portions of the [[Grand Canyon]]. Opposing the [[Bridge Canyon Dam|Bridge Canyon]] and [[Marble Canyon Dam|Marble Canyon]] dam projects, full-page ads the Club placed in the ''New York Times'' and the ''Washington Post'' in 1966 exclaimed, \"This time it's the Grand Canyon they want to flood,\" and asked, \"Should we also flood the Sistine Chapel so tourists can get nearer the ceiling?\" The ads generated a storm of protest to the Congress, prompting the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to announce it was suspending the Sierra Club's [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] status pending an investigation. The board had taken the precaution of setting up the [[Sierra Club Foundation]] as a (c)(3) organization in 1960 for endowments and contributions for educational and other non-lobbying activities.<ref name=history/> Even so, contributions to the Club dropped off, aggravating its annual operating deficits. Membership, however, climbed sharply in response to the investigation into the legitimacy of the society's tax status by the IRS from 30,000 in 1965 to 57,000 in 1967 and 75,000 in 1969.\n\nThe victory over the dam projects and challenges from the IRS did not come without costs. To make up for the power that would have been produced by the dams, the Sierra Club actually advocated for coal power plants. The result of the campaign and its trade-off was, in the words of historian Andrew Needham, that \"the Grand Canyon became protected, sacred space,\" while \"the Navajo Reservation\"\u2014which housed some of the main power plants picking up the slack \u2013 \"became increasingly industrial.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Power Lines: Phoenix and the Making of the Modern Southwest|last = Needham|first = Andrew|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 9781400852406|location = Princeton, NJ|pages = 211}}</ref>\n\n=== End of the Brower era ===\n\nDespite the Club's success in blocking plans for the Grand Canyon dams and weathering the transition from 501(c)(3) to [[501(c)#501(c)(4)|501(c)(4)]] status, tension grew over finances between Brower and the board of directors. The Club's annual deficits rose from $100,000 in 1967 and 1968 to some $200,000 in 1969. Another conflict occurred over the Club's policy toward the nuclear power plant to be constructed by [[Pacific Gas and Electric]] (PG&E) at [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant|Diablo Canyon]] near [[San Luis Obispo, California]]. Although the Club had played the leading role blocking PG&E's nuclear power plant proposed for [[Bodega Bay, California]] in the early 1960s, that case had been built around the local environmental impact and earthquake danger from the nearby [[San Andreas fault]], not from opposition to nuclear power itself. In exchange for moving the new proposed site from the environmentally sensitive Nipomo Dunes to Diablo Canyon, the board of directors voted to support PG&E's plan for the power plant. A membership referendum in 1967 upheld the board's decision. But Brower concluded that nuclear power at any location was a mistake, and he voiced his opposition to the plant, contrary to the Club's official policy. As pro- and anti-Brower factions polarized, the annual election of new directors reflected the conflict. Brower's supporters won a majority in 1968, but in the April 1969 election the anti-Brower candidates won all five open positions. Ansel Adams and president Richard Leonard, two of his closest friends on the board, led the opposition to Brower, charging him with financial recklessness and insubordination and calling for his ouster as executive director. The board voted ten to five to accept Brower's resignation.<ref name=history/> Eventually reconciled with the Club, Brower was elected to the board of directors for a term from 1983 to 1988, and again from 1995 to 2000.\n\n=== McCloskey years ===\n\nMichael McCloskey, hired by Brower in 1961 as the Club's first northwest field representative, became the Club's second executive director in 1969. An administrator attentive to detail, McCloskey had set up the Club's conservation department in 1965 and guided the campaigns to save the Grand Canyon and establish [[Redwoods National Park]] and [[North Cascades National Park]]. During the 1970s, McCloskey led the Club's legislative activity\u2014preserving [[Alaska]]n lands and eastern wilderness areas, and supporting the new environmental agenda: the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] of 1976, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] amendments, and the [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act]] of 1977, passed during the administration of President [[Jimmy Carter]]. The Sierra Club made its first presidential endorsement in 1984 in support of [[Walter Mondale]]'s unsuccessful campaign to unseat [[Ronald Reagan]]. McCloskey resigned as executive director in 1985 after 16-1/2 years (the same length of time Brower had led the organization), and assumed the title of chairman, becoming the Club's senior strategist, devoting his time to conservation policy rather than budget planning and administration.<ref>Michael McCloskey, ''In the Thick of It: My Life in the Sierra Club'' (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2000), pp. 99\u2013248.</ref> After a two-year interlude with Douglas Wheeler, whose Republican credentials were disconcerting to liberal members, the Club hired Michael Fischer, the former head of the [[California Coastal Commission]], who served as executive director from 1987 to 1992. [[Carl Pope (environmentalist)|Carl Pope]], formerly the Club's legislative director, was named executive director in 1992.\n\n=== Lobbying within the club ===\n\nIn the 1990s, club members Jim Bensman, Roger Clarke, David Dilworth, Chad Hanson and David Orr along with about 2,000 members formed the John Muir Sierrans (JMS), an internal caucus, to promote changes to club positions. They favored a zero-cut forest policy on public lands and, a few years later, decommissioning Glen Canyon Dam. JMS was successful in changing club positions on both counts.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Broydo|first1=Leora|title=Mutiny at the Sierra Club|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1998/11/mutiny-sierra-club|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Mother Jones|date=November 3, 1998}}</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2008, several Sierra Club officers quit in protest after the Sierra Club agreed to promote products by [[Clorox]], which had been named one of a \"dangerous dozen\" chemical companies by the [[Public Interest Research Group]] in 2004.

The annual [[High Trips]] were led by [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]]  such as [[Francis P. Farquhar]], [[Joseph Nisbet LeConte]], [[Norman Clyde]], [[Walter A. Starr, Jr.]], [[Jules Eichorn]], [[Glen Dawson (mountaineer)|Glen Dawson]], [[Ansel Adams]], and [[David R. Brower]]. A number of [[first ascent]]s  in the Sierra Nevada were made on Sierra Club outings. Sierra Club members were also early enthusiasts of rock climbing. In 1911, the first chapter was formed, Angeles, and it began conducting local excursions in the mountains surrounding [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and throughout the West.\n\nMany major innovations in mountaineering have come from Sierra Club members. [[Norman Clyde]] and [[Jules Eichorn]], considered among the most famous members of the club, completed many first ascents of peaks in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].\n\n[[Glen Dawson (mountaineer)|Glen Dawson]] and [[Royal Robbins]], often on trips sponsored and organized by the Rock Climbing Section of the Angeles Chapter, opened up much of the [[Tahquitz Peak]] area to climbing, which at the time was said to contain some of the hardest routes in the world. The [[Yosemite Decimal System]], the primary method of rating a route's difficulty used in the United States, was developed into its modern form at Tahquitz.\n\n[[Steve Roper]]'s ''[[Fifty Classic Climbs of North America]]'', sponsored and published by the Sierra Club, is still considered one of the definitive rock climbing guidebooks in the United States.\n\nDue to an increasing focus on political activity and concerns about financial liability, mountaineering activity in the Sierra Club has subsided since the 1980s. Some chapters, mostly in California, continue to maintain large mountaineering programs.\n\nThe club currently occasionally awards the [[Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award]] to outstanding member mountaineers.\n\n===Hiking and Outings===\nIn [[World War II]], a number of Sierra Club leaders joined the [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]].<ref name=\"http://sierraclub.org/outings\">{{cite web|url=http://sierraclub.org/outings/ |title=Outings |publisher=Sierra Club |accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref> Among them was [[David R.

These outings form a major part of Sierra Club culture, and in some chapters, constitute the majority of member activity.<ref name=\"http://sierraclub.org/outings\" /> Other chapters, however, may sponsor very few outdoor or recreational activities, being focused solely on political advocacy.

Uniquely for a progressive organization, the Sierra Club has strong grassroots organization in rural areas, with much activity focused on ensuring equitable and environmentally-friendly use of public lands.

Ehrlich|Anne]],<ref name=monitor/> wanted to take the Club into the contentious field of [[immigration to the United States]]. The Club's position was that [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] was a significant factor in the degradation of the environment. Accordingly, the Club supported stabilizing and reducing U.S. and world population. Some members argued that, as a practical matter, U.S. population could not be stabilized, let alone reduced, at the then-current levels of immigration. They urged the Club to support [[immigration reduction]]. The Club had previously addressed the issue of \"mass immigration\",<ref>\"[http://www.susps.org/history/scpolicy.html#ihist Sierra Club Policy: Immigration Policy History].\" SUSPS. Accessed 14 May 2008.</ref> and in 1988, the organization's Population Committee and Conservation Coordinating Committee stated that immigration to the U.S. should be limited, so as to achieve population stabilization.<ref>Kunofsky, Judy. \"[http://www.susps.org/history/popreport1989.html Sierra Club, U.S. Population Growth, and Immigration].\" ''Sierra Club Population Report''.
