She wants her fianc\u00e9 (Tony Kattukaran) to meet her grandmother, who has just been discharged from hospital. Beena, the daughter of K.P. Haridas, who died a few years back is not in good terms with her mother Ratnam over her second marriage. Ratnam happens to visit the house at the same time. There she meets Kuttimalu, a middle-age lady, who was once a housemaid in her teenage days. Kuttimalu is welcomed by grandmother with the same warmth that she enjoyed long back, and she says that her daughters are now well settled and are leading a happy lives. Ratnam is also affectionate towards Kuttimalu, who had once had an affair with Haridas.\n\nIn the night, while arranging the old books of Haridas, Ratnam comes across the snaps of Kuttimalu, which he had taken in his college days. She hands them over to Kuttimalu, which takes her back to the old days. The story switches to the late 1970s, when Kuttimalu ([[Archana Jose Kavi|Archana Kavi]])  had arrived as a maid with Appukuttan, her cousin and her grandmother. Kuttimalu succeeds in winning the heart of Haridas's mother in no time. She was an innocent village girl who always found fun in sharing secrets with Ammini ([[Rima Kallingal]]), a girl of her age.\n\nAmmini informs her about the myth of Neelathamara (blue lotus). According to believers, if they offer a one rupee note at the temple pond and prays deeply to the god, the flower will blossom the next morning and his/her wish will turn into truth. The arrival of Haridas ([[Kailash (Actor)|Kailash]]), a final-year law student, adds more color to her life. He succeeds in alluring Kuttimalu in a short span, and they start to have a romantic and physical relationship. Kuttimalu believes that Haridas really loves her but she fails to understand that it was just fun that Haridas is looking for. Her prayer at the river pond results in blossoming of Neelathamara, which takes her to cloud nine. But news of the engagement of Haridas to Ratnam comes in as a shock, which breaks her down mentally. She slowly realizes that Haridas was never serious in his affair with her and tries to overcome the grief by silently serving Ratnam, his new wife. Ratnam one day comes to know about the affair and, when asked, Haridas replies casually, which makes her go berserk. Ratnam orders Kuttimalu to leave the house' she accepts silently. She is taken home by Appukuttan, whom she married.\n\nNow years have passed and Haridas is no more and both ladies have matured. The film ends with Kuttimalu once again with full heart preparing to take care of the [[octogenarian]] mother of Haridas.\n\n==Production==\n*''Neelathamara'', though was announced as a remake of the old film with the same name, had several changes. While the old film was a love story between Kunjimalu and Haridas, the remake focused more on the contemporary lives of both Ratnam and Kunjimalu. [[M. T.

She wants her fianc\u00e9 (Tony Kattukaran) to meet her grandmother, who has just been discharged from hospital. Beena, the daughter of K.P. Haridas, who died a few years back is not in good terms with her mother Ratnam over her second marriage. Ratnam happens to visit the house at the same time. There she meets Kuttimalu, a middle-age lady, who was once a housemaid in her teenage days. Kuttimalu is welcomed by grandmother with the same warmth that she enjoyed long back, and she says that her daughters are now well settled and are leading a happy lives. Ratnam is also affectionate towards Kuttimalu, who had once had an affair with Haridas.\n\nIn the night, while arranging the old books of Haridas, Ratnam comes across the snaps of Kuttimalu, which he had taken in his college days. She hands them over to Kuttimalu, which takes her back to the old days. The story switches to the late 1970s, when Kuttimalu ([[Archana Jose Kavi|Archana Kavi]])  had arrived as a maid with Appukuttan, her cousin and her grandmother. Kuttimalu succeeds in winning the heart of Haridas's mother in no time. She was an innocent village girl who always found fun in sharing secrets with Ammini ([[Rima Kallingal]]), a girl of her age.\n\nAmmini informs her about the myth of Neelathamara (blue lotus). According to believers, if they offer a one rupee note at the temple pond and prays deeply to the god, the flower will blossom the next morning and his/her wish will turn into truth. The arrival of Haridas ([[Kailash (Actor)|Kailash]]), a final-year law student, adds more color to her life. He succeeds in alluring Kuttimalu in a short span, and they start to have a romantic and physical relationship. Kuttimalu believes that Haridas really loves her but she fails to understand that it was just fun that Haridas is looking for. Her prayer at the river pond results in blossoming of Neelathamara, which takes her to cloud nine. But news of the engagement of Haridas to Ratnam comes in as a shock, which breaks her down mentally. She slowly realizes that Haridas was never serious in his affair with her and tries to overcome the grief by silently serving Ratnam, his new wife. Ratnam one day comes to know about the affair and, when asked, Haridas replies casually, which makes her go berserk. Ratnam orders Kuttimalu to leave the house' she accepts silently. She is taken home by Appukuttan, whom she married.\n\nNow years have passed and Haridas is no more and both ladies have matured. The film ends with Kuttimalu once again with full heart preparing to take care of the [[octogenarian]] mother of Haridas.\n\n==Production==\n*''Neelathamara'', though was announced as a remake of the old film with the same name, had several changes. While the old film was a love story between Kunjimalu and Haridas, the remake focused more on the contemporary lives of both Ratnam and Kunjimalu. [[M. T.

Dr [[George McGavin]] explains the importance of the local [[biodiversity]] and the destruction that [[logging]] is doing to local forests and wildlife, while a lorry loaded with logs is shown filmed from above. The narrator explains the geography and the isolation of the forests on the inner slopes of the huge extinct [[volcano]]. McGavin finds interesting insects including beetles, ants, and millipedes. Buchanan finds a pygmy parrot nest in a [[termite mound]], and after a long wait in a [[bird hide]] he films a pair of [[buff-faced pygmy parrot]]s by their nest. Buchanan helps to place [[remote camera]]s at suitable sites throughout the forest, and later using a [[laptop]] computer at the base-camp, he shows a [[cuscus]] recorded on a [[memory card]] from one of the remote cameras. A [[striped possum]] is found in one of the animal traps, which is released after being studied and filmed. Buchanan films a cuscus in a tree and bats eating figs at night using [[infrared]] illumination. Backshall goes to the island of [[New Britain]] to join a group of cavers.<ref name=one>Episode one</ref>\n\n===Two===\nOn [[New Britain]], a small team of British and French cavers led by Dave Nixon are joined by Backshall, the only naturalist in the caving team. They map a Mageni river cave and hope to discover new caves. Backshall becomes weakened by a fever, the team recover at the base-camp, and on their return to the caves they find and chart an undiscovered cave river. On [[New Guinea]] Buchanan films a [[fruit-dove]] on a nest, Dumbacher takes blood from a [[king bird-of-paradise]] for research and reports that they have netted many more species, Allison finds more frogs, and McGavin follows a caterpillar changing into a large colourful moth using [[time-lapse photography]]. A team disturb large [[fruit bat]]s from trees while boating upriver to a village of about 500 poor New Guinean natives. The medic Jane Stevenson attends to villagers including children very ill with [[malaria]] and McGavin negotiates with the village leaders. Around a night-fire, the tribe show Buchanan feather headdresses and demonstrate a tribal dance wearing feather decorations from [[bird-of-paradise|birds-of-paradise]]. With guides from the village Buchanan traces king birds-of-paradise and [[raggiana bird-of-paradise|raggiana birds-of-paradise]] in the forest from their calls, and films their courtship behaviours.<ref name=two>Episode two</ref> bigger\n\n===Three===\nOn New Guinea, two teams are formed, one of which goes into the [[Mount Bosavi]] [[caldera]]. The extinct volcano is filmed from the air as the helicopter takes an advance team onto its rim, where they have arranged to meet local Kosua people who will be their guides. They climb down into the volcano crater and prepare a base-camp for the rest of the team. Buchanan films a [[tree kangaroo]], and  Helgen helps to identify a [[wallaby]], a [[painted ringtail possum]], a new [[cuscus]] subspecies (similar to the [[silky cuscus]]), and a large new rat species provisionally named the [[Bosavi woolly rat]].<ref name=three>Episode three</ref>\n\nMcGavin heads the other team and goes to [[Tavurvur]], an active volcano on [[New Britain]]. He sees a [[brahminy kite]] hunting over the grey ash-covered landscape, and finds an adult [[rhinoceros beetle]] and one of the larva in a tree stump. He sees [[megapode]] birds digging in the warm ash to bury eggs, and when they have finished he uncovers and reburies a large oval egg. He finds scavenger crabs before spectacular volcanic activity forces the team to evacuate the area. After this, McGavin goes to New Guinea and a helicopter takes him to the rim of Mount Bosavi. He reports on the dangers of [[climate warming]] and of humans to the wildlife as he watches an [[ornate fruit-dove]]. He sets up a night-light which attracts hundreds of moths, and he suspects many are not known to science. As the helicopter arrives to collect him from the summit, he wonders if the rainforest and its biodiversity will be destroyed.<ref name=three>Episode three</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=1510863|title=Lost Land of the Volcano}}\n*{{BBC programme}}\n*{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8234000/8234539.stm|title= Enter a 'lost land of the weird'|publisher= BBC News|first= Matt|last= Walker|date= 6 September 2009|accessdate= 9 September 2009}}\n\n{{BBC Natural History Unit}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lost Land Of The Volcano}}\n[[Category:2009 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2009 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000s British television series]]\n[[Category:BBC television documentaries]]\n[[Category:BBC high definition programmes]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about nature]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Lost Land of the Volcano\n| image                = bbc llotv.jpg\n| alt=Lost Land of the Volcano title card\n| caption              = Series title card from UK broadcast\n| show_name_2          = ''Expedition New Guinea''\n| genre                = [[Nature documentary]]\n| writer               = \n| director             = \n| presenter            = {{Unbulleted list| [[Gordon Buchanan]] | [[Steve Backshall]] | [[George McGavin]] }}\n| narrated             = [[Philip Glenister]]\n| composer             = Jonathan Gunton\n| country              = United Kingdom\n| language             = English\n| num_series             = 1\n| num_episodes         = 3\n| executive_producer   = Tim Martin\n| producer             = \n| location             = [[New Guinea]]\n| runtime              = 60 minutes\n| company              = [[BBC Natural History Unit]]\n| channel              = {{Unbulleted list| [[BBC One]] | [[BBC HD]] }}\n| picture_format       = {{Unbulleted list| [[Standard-definition television|SD]]: [[576i]] | [[High-definition television|HD]]: [[720p]] }}\n| audio_format         = [[Stereophonic sound|Stereo]]\n| first_aired          = {{start date|2009|9|8|df=yes}}\n| last_aired           = {{end date|2009|9|22|df=yes}}\n| preceded_by          = ''[[Lost Land of the Jaguar]]'' (2008)\n| followed_by          = ''[[Lost Land of the Tiger]]'' (2010)\n| related              = \n| website              = https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00m82h7\n}}\n\n'''''Lost Land of the Volcano''''' is a three-part [[nature documentary]] series produced by the [[BBC Natural History Unit]] which follows a scientific expedition to the island of [[New Guinea]].

Dr [[George McGavin]] explains the importance of the local [[biodiversity]] and the destruction that [[logging]] is doing to local forests and wildlife, while a lorry loaded with logs is shown filmed from above. The narrator explains the geography and the isolation of the forests on the inner slopes of the huge extinct [[volcano]]. McGavin finds interesting insects including beetles, ants, and millipedes. Buchanan finds a pygmy parrot nest in a [[termite mound]], and after a long wait in a [[bird hide]] he films a pair of [[buff-faced pygmy parrot]]s by their nest. Buchanan helps to place [[remote camera]]s at suitable sites throughout the forest, and later using a [[laptop]] computer at the base-camp, he shows a [[cuscus]] recorded on a [[memory card]] from one of the remote cameras. A [[striped possum]] is found in one of the animal traps, which is released after being studied and filmed. Buchanan films a cuscus in a tree and bats eating figs at night using [[infrared]] illumination. Backshall goes to the island of [[New Britain]] to join a group of cavers.<ref name=one>Episode one</ref>\n\n===Two===\nOn [[New Britain]], a small team of British and French cavers led by Dave Nixon are joined by Backshall, the only naturalist in the caving team. They map a Mageni river cave and hope to discover new caves. Backshall becomes weakened by a fever, the team recover at the base-camp, and on their return to the caves they find and chart an undiscovered cave river. On [[New Guinea]] Buchanan films a [[fruit-dove]] on a nest, Dumbacher takes blood from a [[king bird-of-paradise]] for research and reports that they have netted many more species, Allison finds more frogs, and McGavin follows a caterpillar changing into a large colourful moth using [[time-lapse photography]]. A team disturb large [[fruit bat]]s from trees while boating upriver to a village of about 500 poor New Guinean natives. The medic Jane Stevenson attends to villagers including children very ill with [[malaria]] and McGavin negotiates with the village leaders. Around a night-fire the tribe show Buchanan feather headdresses and demonstrate a tribal dance wearing feather decorations from [[bird-of-paradise|birds-of-paradise]]. With guides from the village Buchanan traces king birds-of-paradise and [[raggiana bird-of-paradise|raggiana birds-of-paradise]] in the forest from their calls, and films their courtship behaviours.<ref name=two>Episode two</ref>\n\n===Three===\nOn New Guinea, two teams are formed, one of which goes into the [[Mount Bosavi]] [[caldera]]. The extinct volcano is filmed from the air as the helicopter takes an advance team onto its rim, where they have arranged to meet local Kosua people who will be their guides. They climb down into the volcano crater and prepare a base-camp for the rest of the team. Buchanan films a [[tree kangaroo]], and  Helgen helps to identify a [[wallaby]], a [[painted ringtail possum]], a new [[cuscus]] subspecies (similar to the [[silky cuscus]]), and a large new rat species provisionally named the [[Bosavi woolly rat]].<ref name=three>Episode three</ref>\n\nMcGavin heads the other team and goes to [[Tavurvur]], an active volcano on [[New Britain]]. He sees a [[brahminy kite]] hunting over the grey ash-covered landscape, and finds an adult [[rhinoceros beetle]] and one of the larva in a tree stump. He sees [[megapode]] birds digging in the warm ash to bury eggs, and when they have finished he uncovers and reburies a large oval egg. He finds scavenger crabs before spectacular volcanic activity forces the team to evacuate the area. After this, McGavin goes to New Guinea and a helicopter takes him to the rim of Mount Bosavi. He reports on the dangers of [[climate warming]] and of humans to the wildlife as he watches an [[ornate fruit-dove]]. He sets up a night-light which attracts hundreds of moths, and he suspects many are not known to science. As the helicopter arrives to collect him from the summit, he wonders if the rainforest and its biodiversity will be destroyed.<ref name=three>Episode three</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=1510863|title=Lost Land of the Volcano}}\n*{{BBC programme}}\n*{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8234000/8234539.stm|title= Enter a 'lost land of the weird'|publisher= BBC News|first= Matt|last= Walker|date= 6 September 2009|accessdate= 9 September 2009}}\n\n{{BBC Natural History Unit}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lost Land Of The Volcano}}\n[[Category:2009 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2009 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000s British television series]]\n[[Category:BBC television documentaries]]\n[[Category:BBC high definition programmes]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about nature]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n", "name_user": "203.205.30.104", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eTwo)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Land_of_the_Volcano"}

The first male-to-female genital surgeries were performed in the 1930s in Germany. At that time, the term \"transsexual\" had been coined by the sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, who cared for and studied transgender individuals.\n\nLili Elbe, a Danish transgender woman, is historically regarded as one of the first to undergo gender affirmation surgery in Dresden, Germany, in the 1930s. She underwent several surgeries and died from complications related to her final surgery. Wide publicity and attention was brought to the United States in the 1950s when Christine Jorgensen, a former United States Army soldier, was the first American to undergo gender affirmation surgery in Europe.\n\nIn the late 1950s, the French plastic surgeon Dr. Georges Burou developed the modern penile inversion vaginoplasty technique. Modifications of this technique are still commonly used today. Nearly a decade after Dr. Burou's work, gender affirmation surgery became available at some academic centers in the United States, including Johns Hopkins Medical Center and Stanford University. Since the late 1970s and early 1980s, a shift in paradigm occurred, with most surgeries performed by private practicing surgeons. These operations are again returning to academic centers in the United States and formal training programs for this type of surgery are under development.\n\n==Medical uses==\nVaginoplasty is the description of the following surgical interventions:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* separation of congenitally fused urethra and vagina<ref name=Hiort2014/>\n* repair of a urethra that is short<ref name=Hiort2014>{{cite book | last = Hiort | first = O | title = Understanding differences and disorders of sex development (DSD) | publisher = Karger | location = Basel | year = 2014 | isbn = 9783318025590|postscript=; Access provided by the [[University of Pittsburgh]]}}</ref><!-- p 104 -->\n* vaginal construction<ref name=Hoffman2012/><ref name=icd100UQGOZZ>{{cite web \n| title = 2016 ICD-10-PCS Procedure Code 0UQG0ZZ : Repair Vagina, Open Approach \n| url = http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10PCS/Codes/0/U/Q/G/0UQG0ZZ |publisher=ICD10Data.com\n| accessdate = 2016-03-03 }}</ref>\n* vaginal [[Plastic surgery|reconstruction]]<ref name=Hoffman2012/><ref name=icd100UQGOZZ/>\n* vaginal vault [[prolapse]]{{sfn|Baggish|page=467-474}}\n* vaginal suspension and fixation<ref name=Hoffman2012/><ref name=icd100UQGOZZ/><!-- pages 1068-1157 -->\n* operations on [[Recto-uterine pouch|cul-de-sac]]<ref name=Hoffman2012/><ref name=icd100UQGOZZ/><!-- pages 1068-1157 -->\n* repair of [[cystocele]]<ref name=Hoffman2012/><ref name=icd100UQGOZZ/><!-- pages 1068-1157 -->and [[rectocele]]<ref name=Hoffman2012/>\n* [[retropubic paravaginal repair]]{{sfn|Baggish|page=409-412}}\n* the repair of a cystocele using a [[graft (surgery)|graft]] or [[prosthesis]]<ref name=Hoffman2012/><ref name=icd100UQGOZZ/>\n* the repair of a cystocele and a rectocele in the same procedure using a graft or prosthethic device<ref name=Hoffman2012/><!-- pages 1068-1157 --><ref name=icd100UQGOZZ/>\n* the repair of a rectocele using a [[Graft (surgery)|graft]] or [[Surgical mesh|prosthetic material]]<ref name=Hoffman2012/><!-- pages 1068-1157 -->\n* the vaginal construction using a graft or [[prosthetic]] material<ref name=Hoffman2012/><!-- pages 1068-1157 --><ref name = acien/>\n* the vaginal reconstruction using a graft or prosthetic material<ref name=Hoffman2012/><!-- pages 1068-1157 -->\n* the vaginal suspension and stabilization using with graft or prosthetic material\n* treatment of [[MRKH syndrome]] (vaginal agenesis)<ref name = acien/>\n* [[hymenorrhaphy]]\n{{div col end}}\nIn some instances, extra tissue is needed to reconstruct or construct the vagina.

The inverted penile skin uses inferior pedicle skin or abdominal skin for the lining of the neovagina. The skin is cut to form an appropriate-sized flap.

Sometimes sexual intercourse can result in the dilation of a newly constructed vagina.<ref name=\"acien\" />\n== Recovery ==\nPain generally managed with patient-controlled analgesia once able to tolerate orally, oral narcotic agent is prescribed. Diet is restricted to ice chips on postoperative day 0, then advanced to clear liquids on postoperative day 1 and later to a regular diet as tolerated. A stool softener is administered for bowel regimen. Activity is initially restricted to bed rest in beach chair position to avoid undue tension on the suture lines or pressure on the grafts until the dressings and drains are removed on postoperative day 2 to 3. After drain removal, activity can be increased to light ambulation.\n\nTight vaginal packing and an indwelling bladder catheter remain in place until postoperative day 6 to 7, when they are removed and vaginal dilation is taught. Vaginal dilation is performed using progressively larger rigid dilators three times daily for 12 weeks, then once to twice daily for another 12 weeks. Six months after surgery, patients are encouraged to dilate at least weekly if they are sexually active, or daily if they are not.\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Focus area\n!Instructions\n|-\n|Activity\n|Avoid strenuous activity for 6 weeks. Avoid swimming or bike riding for 3 months.\n|-\n|Sitting\n|For the first month post-op, sitting may be uncomfortable, but not unsafe. Recommendation to use donut ring to relieve pressure at surgical site.\n|-\n|Bathing\n|Resume showering following first postoperative visit, patting incisional areas dry. Do not take baths or submerge in water for 8 weeks post-op.\n|-\n|Swelling\n|Labial swelling is normal and will gradually resolve 6\u20138 weeks postoperatively. Swelling may be aggravated with long-term sitting or standing. For the first week post-op, applying ice on the perineum for 20 minutes every hour can assist in relieving some swelling.\n|-\n|Sexual intercourse\n|You may resume sexual intercourse 3 months after surgery, unless you have been instructed otherwise.\n|-\n|Hygiene\n|Wash hands before and after any contact with the genital area. Shower or wash daily. When washing, wipe from front to back to avoid contamination by bacteria from the anal region. Avoid tight clothing; friction may facilitate bacteria transfer.\n|-\n|Vaginal discharge\n|Vaginal discharge that is brownish yellow should be expected in the first 4\u20136 weeks postoperatively. Bleeding and spotting should be expected in the first 8 weeks postoperatively. Soap and water douche should help reduce this. Chamomile or lavender liquid soap can help cleanse the neo vagina as well.\n|-\n|Tobacco/smoking\n|Avoid tobacco use or smoking 1 month postoperatively, as this can interfere with the healing process.\n|-\n|Diet/nausea/constipation\n|Begin with a liquid diet and increase to your usual diet as tolerated. Anti-nausea medication may be prescribed. Narcotic pain medication may cause constipation; a stool softener such as Colace can help prevent constipation.\n|-\n|Pain medication\n|Postoperative pain is normal, and pain medication may be prescribed. Pain medication is to be taken as prescribed, and can be switched for Extra Strength Tylenol at any time.\n|-\n|Dilation\n|Dilation is an important part of recovery. Dilators may be provided to patient with instructions regarding dilation in the post-op period.\n|}\n\n=== Dilation Instructions<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://transcare.ucsf.edu/guidelines/vaginoplasty|title=Vaginoplasty procedures, complications and aftercare {{!}} Transgender Care|website=transcare.ucsf.edu|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> ===\nEach person's dilation schedule may vary.\n\n* Prior to insertion into the vagina, ensure the dilator is clean.\n* Clean the dilator with warm water and antibacterial soap.

The first male-to-female genital surgeries were performed in the 1930s in Germany. At that time, the term \"transsexual\" had been coined by the sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, who cared for and studied transgender individuals.\n\nLili Elbe, a Danish transgender woman, is historically regarded as one of the first to undergo gender affirmation surgery in Dresden, Germany, in the 1930s. She underwent several surgeries and died from complications related to her final surgery. Wide publicity and attention was brought to the United States in the 1950s when Christine Jorgensen, a former United States Army soldier, was the first American to undergo gender affirmation surgery in Europe.\n\nIn the late 1950s, the French plastic surgeon Dr. Georges Burou developed the modern penile inversion vaginoplasty technique. Modifications of this technique are still commonly used today. Nearly a decade after Dr. Burou's work, gender affirmation surgery became available at some academic centers in the United States, including Johns Hopkins Medical Center and Stanford University.

The inverted penile skin uses inferior pedicle skin or abdominal skin for the lining of the neovagina. The skin is cut to form an appropriate-sized flap. The skin flap is sometimes combined with a scrotal or urethral flap.<ref name=\"HorbachBouman2015\" />\n\nThe penile inversion technique was pioneered by Dr. [[Georges Burou]] in his Morocco clinic in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Hage-2007\">{{cite journal |author1=Hage, J Joris |author2=Karim, Refaat B. |author3=Laub, Donald R.

Diet is restricted to ice chips on postoperative day 0, then advanced to clear liquids on postoperative day 1 and later to a regular diet as tolerated. A stool softener is administered for bowel regimen. Activity is initially restricted to bed rest in beach chair position to avoid undue tension on the suture lines or pressure on the grafts until the dressings and drains are removed on postoperative day 2 to 3. After drain removal, activity can be increased to light ambulation.\n\nTight vaginal packing and an indwelling bladder catheter remain in place until postoperative day 6 to 7, when they are removed and vaginal dilation is taught. Vaginal dilation is performed using progressively larger rigid dilators three times daily for 12 weeks, then once to twice daily for another 12 weeks. Six months after surgery, patients are encouraged to dilate at least weekly if they are sexually active, or daily if they are not.\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Focus area\n!Instructions\n|-\n|Activity\n|Avoid strenuous activity for 6 weeks. Avoid swimming or bike riding for 3 months.\n|-\n|Sitting\n|For the first month post-op, sitting may be uncomfortable, but not unsafe. Recommendation to use donut ring to relieve pressure at surgical site.\n|-\n|Bathing\n|Resume showering following first postoperative visit, patting incisional areas dry. Do not take baths or submerge in water for 8 weeks post-op.\n|-\n|Swelling\n|Labial swelling is normal and will gradually resolve 6\u20138 weeks postoperatively. Swelling may be aggravated with long-term sitting or standing. For the first week post-op, applying ice on the perineum for 20 minutes every hour can assist in relieving some swelling.\n|-\n|Sexual intercourse\n|You may resume sexual intercourse 3 months after surgery, unless you have been instructed otherwise.\n|-\n|Hygiene\n|Wash hands before and after any contact with the genital area. Shower or wash daily. When washing, wipe from front to back to avoid contamination by bacteria from the anal region. Avoid tight clothing; friction may facilitate bacteria transfer.\n|-\n|Vaginal discharge\n|Vaginal discharge that is brownish yellow should be expected in the first 4\u20136 weeks postoperatively. Bleeding and spotting should be expected in the first 8 weeks postoperatively. Soap and water douche should help reduce this. Chamomile or lavender liquid soap can help cleanse the neo vagina as well.\n|-\n|Tobacco/smoking\n|Avoid tobacco use or smoking 1 month postoperatively, as this can interfere with the healing process.\n|-\n|Diet/nausea/constipation\n|Begin with a liquid diet and increase to your usual diet as tolerated. Anti-nausea medication may be prescribed. Narcotic pain medication may cause constipation; a stool softener such as Colace can help prevent constipation.\n|-\n|Pain medication\n|Postoperative pain is normal, and pain medication may be prescribed. Pain medication is to be taken as prescribed, and can be switched for Extra Strength Tylenol at any time.\n|-\n|Dilation\n|Dilation is an important part of recovery.

The two schools shared a common board of directors and president ([[Columbia University]] professor [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]]) but retained their distinct identities. The conductor and music-educator [[Frank Damrosch]] continued as the Institute's dean, and the Australian pianist and composer [[Ernest Hutcheson]] was appointed dean of the Graduate School. In 1937, Hutcheson succeeded Erskine as president of the two institutions, a job he held until 1945. In 1946, the Institute of Musical Art and the Juilliard Graduate School completely merged to form a single institution. The president of the school at that time was [[William Schuman]], the first winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]]. Schuman established the [[Juilliard String Quartet]] in 1946 and the Dance Division in 1951, under the direction of [[Martha Hill]].\n\nWilliam Schuman graduated from [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Columbia's Teachers College]] (BS 1935, MA 1937) and attended the Juilliard Summer School in 1932, 1933 and 1936. While attending Juilliard Summer School, he developed a personal dislike for traditional music theory and ear training curricula, finding little value in counterpoint and dictation. Soon after being appointed as president of the Juilliard School of Music in 1945, William Schuman created a new curriculum called the ''Literature and Materials of Music'' (L&M), designed for composers to teach. L&M was Schuman's reaction against more formal theory and ear training, and as a result did not have a formal structure. The general mandate was \"to give the student an awareness of the dynamic nature of the materials of music.\" The quality and degree of each student's education in harmony, music history, or ear training was dependent on how each composer-teacher decided to interpret this mandate.\n\nWilliam Schuman resigned as president of Juilliard after being elected president of Lincoln Center in 1962. [[Peter Mennin]], another composer with directorial experience at the [[Peabody Conservatory]], was elected as his successor. Mennin made significant changes to the L&M program\u2014ending ear training and music history and hiring the well known pedagogue Ren\u00e9e Longy to teach [[solf\u00e8ge]]. In 1968, Mennin hired [[John Houseman]] to manage a new Drama Division, and in 1969 oversaw Juilliard's relocation from Claremont Avenue to Lincoln Center. The School's name was changed to The Juilliard School to reflect its broadened mission to educate musicians, directors, and actors.<ref>[http://www.juilliard.edu/about/history.html A Brief History], The Juilliard School.

Polisi's many accomplishments include philanthropic successes, broadening of the curriculum and establishment of dormitories for Juilliard's students. In 2001, the school established a [[jazz]] performance training program. In September 2005, [[Colin Davis]] conducted an orchestra that combined students from the Juilliard and London's [[Royal Academy of Music]] at the BBC [[The Proms|Proms]], and during 2008 the Juilliard Orchestra embarked on a successful tour of China, performing concerts as part of the [[Olympiad#Cultural Olympiad|Cultural Olympiad]] in Beijing, [[Suzhou]], and Shanghai under the expert leadership of Maestro [[Xian Zhang (conductor)|Xian Zhang]].\n\nIn 1999, the Juilliard School was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#99 |title=Lifetime Honors: National Medal of Arts |publisher=[[National Endowment for the Arts]] |accessdate=March 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054307/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#86 |archivedate=July 21, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Manuscript collection}}In 2006, Juilliard received a trove of precious music manuscripts from board chair and philanthropist [[Bruce Kovner]].

The [[Lila Bell Wallace|Lila Acheson Wallace]] American Playwrights Program, begun in 1993, offers one-year, tuition-free, graduate fellowships; selected students may be offered a second-year extension and receive an Artist Diploma. The [[Andrew W.

Vocal majors must also study diction and performance. Similarly, pianists must study piano performance. String, brass and woodwind players as well as percussionists also participate in orchestra. The pre-college has two orchestras, the Pre-College Symphony (PCS) and the Pre-College Orchestra (PCO). Placement is by age and students may elect to study conducting, chorus and chamber music.\n\nThe Pre-College Division began as the Preparatory Centers (later the Preparatory Division), part of the Institute of Musical Art since 1916. The Pre-College Division was established in 1969 with Katherine McC. Ellis as its first director. Olegna Fuschi served as director from 1975 to 1988. The Fuschi/Mennin partnership allowed the Pre-College Division to thrive, affording its graduates training at the highest artistic level (with many of the same teachers as the college division), as well as their own commencement ceremony and diplomas. In addition to Fuschi, directors of Juilliard's Pre-College Division have included composer Dr. [[Andrew Thomas (composer)|Andrew Thomas]]. The current director of the Pre-College Division is Yoheved Kaplinsky.\n\n===Music Technology Center===\nThe Music Technology Center at the Juilliard School was created in 1993 to provide students with the opportunity to use [[digital technology]] in the creation and performance of new music.

The two schools shared a common board of directors and president ([[Columbia University]] professor [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]]) but retained their distinct identities. The conductor and music-educator [[Frank Damrosch]] continued as the Institute's dean, and the Australian pianist and composer [[Ernest Hutcheson]] was appointed dean of the Graduate School. In 1937, Hutcheson succeeded Erskine as president of the two institutions, a job he held until 1945. In 1946, the Institute of Musical Art and the Juilliard Graduate School completely merged to form a single institution. The president of the school at that time was [[William Schuman]], the first winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]]. Schuman established the [[Juilliard String Quartet]] in 1946 and the Dance Division in 1951, under the direction of [[Martha Hill]].\n\nWilliam Schuman graduated from [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Columbia's Teachers College]] (BS 1935, MA 1937) and attended the Juilliard Summer School in 1932, 1933 and 1936. While attending Juilliard Summer School, he developed a personal dislike for traditional music theory and ear training curricula, finding little value in counterpoint and dictation. Soon after being appointed as president of the Juilliard School of Music in 1945, William Schuman created a new curriculum called the ''Literature and Materials of Music'' (L&M), designed for composers to teach. L&M was Schuman's reaction against more formal theory and ear training, and as a result did not have a formal structure. The general mandate was \"to give the student an awareness of the dynamic nature of the materials of music.\" The quality and degree of each student's education in harmony, music history, or ear training was dependent on how each composer-teacher decided to interpret this mandate.\n\nWilliam Schuman resigned as president of Juilliard after being elected president of Lincoln Center in 1962. [[Peter Mennin]], another composer with directorial experience at the [[Peabody Conservatory]], was elected as his successor. Mennin made significant changes to the L&M program\u2014ending ear training and music history and hiring the well known pedagogue Ren\u00e9e Longy to teach [[solf\u00e8ge]]. In 1968, Mennin hired [[John Houseman]] to manage a new Drama Division, and in 1969 oversaw Juilliard's relocation from Claremont Avenue to Lincoln Center. The School's name was changed to The Juilliard School to reflect its broadened mission to educate musicians, directors, and actors.<ref>[http://www.juilliard.edu/about/history.html A Brief History], The Juilliard School.

Polisi's many accomplishments include philanthropic successes, broadening of the curriculum and establishment of dormitories for Juilliard's students. In 2001, the school established a [[jazz]] performance training program. In September 2005, [[Colin Davis]] conducted an orchestra that combined students from the Juilliard and London's [[Royal Academy of Music]] at the BBC [[The Proms|Proms]], and during 2008 the Juilliard Orchestra embarked on a successful tour of China, performing concerts as part of the [[Olympiad#Cultural Olympiad|Cultural Olympiad]] in Beijing, [[Suzhou]], and Shanghai under the expert leadership of Maestro [[Xian Zhang (conductor)|Xian Zhang]].\n\nIn 1999, the Juilliard School was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#99 |title=Lifetime Honors: National Medal of Arts |publisher=[[National Endowment for the Arts]] |accessdate=March 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054307/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#86 |archivedate=July 21, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Manuscript collection}}In 2006, Juilliard received a trove of precious music manuscripts from board chair and philanthropist [[Bruce Kovner]].

Examples of items commonly sold as collectables include [[plate (dishware)|plates]], [[figurine]]s, [[bell (instrument)|bells]], [[graphics]], [[Beer stein|steins]], and [[doll]]s. Some companies that produce manufactured collectables are members of The Gift and Collectibles Guild.<ref name=Danziger />\n\n''[[Special edition]]s'', ''limited editions'' and variants on these terms fall under the category of manufactured collectables and are used as a marketing incentive for various types of product. They were originally{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} applied to products related to the arts\u2014such as books, prints or recorded music and films\u2014but are now used for cars, fine wine and many other collectables. A special edition typically includes extra material of some kind. A limited edition is restricted in the number of copies produced, although the number may be arbitrarily high.\n\n=== Collectables in commerce ===\nManufacturers and retailers have used collectables in a number of ways to increase sales. One use is in the form of licensed collectables based on [[intellectual properties]], such as images, characters and logos from literature, music, movies, radio, television, and video games. A large subsection of [[Merchandising#Licensing|licensing]] includes advertising, brandname, and character collectibles. Another use of collectables in retail is in the form of [[Prize (marketing)|prize]]s (items of nominal value packaged with or included in the price of a retail product at no additional cost) and [[Premium (marketing)|premium]]s (items that can be \"purchased\" by redeeming coupons, [[boxtop]]s, or [[Proof of purchase|proofs of purchase]] from the product along with a small fee to cover shipping and handling). Also, collectables have played an important role in tourism, in the form of [[souvenirs]].<ref name=\"museum\">[http://www.byte-time.net/souvenir/ch4.htm Museum of the Personal: the souvenir and nostalgia, Chapter 4 \u2014 What is a souvenir?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723034110/http://www.byte-time.net/souvenir/ch4.htm |date=July 23, 2011 }}</ref> Another important field of collecting that is also big business is '''memorabilia''', which includes collectables related to a person, organization, event or media, including T-shirts, posters, and numerous other collectables marketed to fans; but also includes [[ephemera]] from historical, media, or entertainment events, items that were meant to be thrown away but were saved by fans and accumulated by collectors.\n\n=== Collectables as investments ===\nCollectables are items of limited supply that are sought for a variety of reasons including a possible increase in value. In a financial sense, collectables can be viewed as a hedge against inflation. Over time, their value can also increase as they become more rare due to loss, damage or destruction. One drawback to investing in collectables is the potential lack of liquidity, particularly for very obscure items. There is also a risk for fraud.<ref>[http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Collectables TheFreeDictionary.com: Financial Dictionary: Collectables]</ref>\n\nThe 1960s through the early 1990s were major years for the manufacturing of contemporary collectables. While some individuals purchased contemporary collectables to enjoy and use, many purchased them as investments. Speculative markets developed for many of these pieces. Because so many people bought for investment purposes, duplicates are common. And although many collectables were labeled as \"limited editions\", the actual number of items produced was very large. Consequently, there is very little demand for many (but not all) items produced during this time period, and their market values are often low.\n\n== History ==\nThe urge to collect unusual and fascinating objects is primeval and [[Bower bird#Behaviour and ecology|not limited to humans]].\n\nThe Renaissance [[Cabinet of Curiosities]] was an antecedent both of modern museums and modern collecting.\n\nThe earliest manufactured collectables were included as incentives with other products, such as [[cigarette card]]s in packs of [[cigarette]]s. Popular items developed a [[secondary market]] and sometimes became the subject of \"collectable crazes\". Eventually many collectable items came to be sold separately, instead of being used as marketing tools to increase the appeal of other products.\n\nTo encourage collecting, manufacturers often create an entire series of a given collectable, with each item differentiated in some fashion. Examples include [[sports card]]s depicting individual players, or different designs of [[Beanie Baby|Beanie Babies]]. Enthusiasts will often try to assemble a complete set of the available variations.\n\nCollector editions are another way of supporting collectables. They typically are produced in limited amount and contain additional content that can be valuable for a collector. This practice is mostly popular in [[video game]]s.\n\nEarly versions of a product, manufactured in smaller quantities before its popularity as a collectable developed, sometimes command exorbitant premiums on the secondary market. [[Doll]]s and other [[toy]]s made during an adult collector's childhood can command such premiums.

In some [[keyboard (music)|keyboard]] instruments, such as the [[harpsichord]], the musician presses a key that plucks the string.\n\nWith bowed instruments, the player pulls a rosined horsehair bow across the strings, causing them to vibrate. With a [[hurdy-gurdy]], the musician cranks a wheel whose rosined edge touches the strings. \n\nBowed instruments include the [[string section]] instruments of the [[Classical music]] [[orchestra]] ([[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]] and [[double bass]]) and a number of other instruments (e.g., [[viol]]s and [[Viol|gambas]] used in [[early music]] from the [[Baroque music]] era and [[fiddle]]s used in many types of [[folk music]]). All of the bowed string instruments can also be plucked with the fingers, a technique called \"[[pizzicato]]\". A wide variety of techniques are used to sound notes on the [[electric guitar]], including plucking with the fingernails or a plectrum, strumming and even \"[[tapping]]\" on the fingerboard and using [[feedback (guitar)|feedback]] from a loud, [[distortion (music)|distorted]] [[guitar amplifier]] to produce a sustained sound. Some types of string instrument are mainly plucked, such as the [[harp]] and the [[electric bass]]. In the [[Hornbostel-Sachs]] scheme of [[musical instrument classification]], used in [[organology]], string instruments are called [[chordophone]]s. Other examples include the [[sitar]], [[rebab]], [[banjo]], [[mandolin]], [[ukulele]], and [[bouzouki]].\n\nIn most string instruments, the vibrations are transmitted to the body of the instrument, which often incorporates some sort of hollow or enclosed area. The body of the instrument also vibrates, along with the air inside it. The vibration of the body of the instrument and the enclosed hollow or chamber make the vibration of the string more audible to the performer and audience. The body of most string instruments is hollow. Some, however\u2014such as [[electric guitar]] and other instruments that rely on electronic amplification\u2014may have a solid wood body.\n\n===Earliest string instruments===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | image2 = MusicalBow.gif\n | width2 = 145\n | alt2 = Musical bow\n | caption2 = Musical bows have survived in some parts  of Africa.\n\n | image1 = COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Harp-luit TMnr A-11006.jpg\n | width1 = 150\n | alt1 = Harp lute, from West Africa\n | caption1  = Bow Harp or Harp Lute, West Africa\n}}\nDating to around c. 13,000\u2013BC, a cave painting in the [[Trois Fr\u00e8res]] cave in France depicts what some believe is a [[musical bow]], a hunting bow used as a single-stringed musical instrument.<ref name=vanCampen>{{cite web | last1= Campen | first1= Ank van | title= The music-bow from prehistory till today | url= http://www.harphistory.info/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=65&Itemid=17&lang=en | website= HarpHistory.info | access-date= March 26, 2015 | quote= A cave-painting in the \"Trois Fr\u00e8res\" cave in France dating from about 15,000 years ago.

Lyres with wooden bodies and strings used for plucking or playing with a bow represent key instruments that point towards later harps and violin-type instruments; moreover, Indian instruments from 500 BC have been discovered with anything from 7 to 21 strings.\n\naniitttootto\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | image2 = M\u00e9rida pandurium.jpg\n | width2 = 120\n | alt2 = Sculpture of a Roman pandura in Spain\n | caption2 =Spanish [[stele]] of a boy with a [[pandura]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Deceased is the Young Lutaia Lupata Who is Shown Playing the Lute or Pandurium |url=https://m.flickr.com/#/photos/julio-claudians/8098646683/ |quote=Museum information sign for the stele.

Middle Eastern rebecs represented breakthroughs in terms of shape and strings, with a half a pear shape using three strings. Early versions of the violin and fiddle, by comparison, emerged in Europe through instruments such as the [[gittern]], a four-stringed precursor to the guitar, and basic [[lute]]s. These instruments typically used catgut (animal intestine) and other materials, including silk, for their strings.\n\n===Renaissance to modern===\n[[File:Viol, fidel and rebec.jpg|thumb|Viol, [[vielle|fidel]] and rebec (from left to right) on display at ''Amakusa Korejiyokan'' in Amakusa, Kumamoto, Japan]]\nString instrument design refined during the [[Renaissance]] and into the [[Baroque period]] (1600\u20131750) of musical history. [[Violins]] and [[guitars]] became more consistent in design and were roughly similar to acoustic guitars of the 2000s. The violins of the [[Renaissance]] featured intricate woodwork and stringing, while more elaborate bass instruments such as the bandora were produced alongside quill-plucked [[cittern]]s, and Spanish body guitars.\n\nIn the 19th century, string instruments were made more widely available through mass production, with wood string instruments a key part of orchestras \u2013 cellos, violas, and upright basses, for example, were now standard instruments for chamber ensembles and smaller orchestras. At the same time, the 19th-century guitar became more typically associated with six string models, rather than traditional five string versions.\n\nMajor changes to string instruments in the 20th century primarily involved innovations in electronic [[instrument amplification]] and electronic music \u2013 electric violins were available by the 1920s, and were an important part of emerging jazz music trends in the United States. The [[acoustic guitar]] was widely used in [[blues]] and [[jazz]], but as an acoustic instrument, it was not loud enough to be a solo instrument, so these genres mostly used it as an [[accompaniment]] [[rhythm section]] instrument. In [[big band]]s of the 1920s, the [[acoustic guitar]] played backing chords, but it was not loud enough to play solos like the [[saxophone]] and [[trumpet]]. The development of guitar amplifiers, which contained a [[power amplifier]] and a [[loudspeaker]] in a [[speaker enclosure|wooden cabinet]], let [[jazz guitar]]ists play solos and be heard over a big band. The development of the [[electric guitar]] provided guitarists with an instrument that was built to connect to guitar amplifiers. Electric guitars have [[magnetic pickup]]s, [[potentiometer|volume control knob]]s and an output jack.\n\nIn the 1960s, larger, more powerful guitar amplifiers were developed, called \"stacks\". These powerful amplifiers enabled guitarists to perform in rock bands that played in large venues such as stadiums and outdoor music festivals (e.g., [[Woodstock Music Festival]]). Along with the development of guitar amplifiers, a large range of electronic [[effects unit]]s, many in small [[stompbox]] pedals were introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, such as [[fuzz pedal]]s, [[flanger]]s and [[phaser (music)|phaser]]  enabling performers to create unique new sounds during the [[psychedelic rock]] era. Breakthroughs in electric guitar and basses technologies and playing styles enabled major breakthroughs in pop and rock music in the 1960s and 1970s. The distinctive sound of the amplified [[electric guitar]] was the centerpiece of new genres of music such as [[blues rock]] and [[Jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]]. The sonic power of the loudly amplified, highly [[distortion (music)|distorted]] electric guitar was to key element of the early [[heavy metal music]], with the distorted guitar being used in [[lead guitar]] roles, and with [[power chord]]s as a [[rhythm guitar]].\n\nThe ongoing use of electronic amplification and effects units in string instruments, ranging from traditional instruments like the violin to the new electric guitar, added variety to [[contemporary classical music]] performances, and enabled experimentation in the dynamic and timbre (tone colour) range of orchestras, bands, and solo performances.<ref name=\"mp\">{{cite book|author=Michael Chanan|title=Musica Practica: The Social Practice of Western Music from Gregorian Chant to Postmodernism|year=1994|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-005-4|pages=170}}</ref>\n\n==Types of instruments==\n\n===Construction===\n<!--[[Bout (musical instrument)]] redirects and [[Bout]] links directly to this section.-->\nString instruments can be divided in three groups\n;[[Lute]]s : Instruments that support the strings via a [[Neck (music)|neck]] and a '''bout''' (\"'''gourd'''\"), for instance a guitar, a violin, or a [[baglama|saz]]\n;[[Harp]]s : Instruments that contain the strings within a frame\n;[[Zither]]s : Instruments that have the strings mounted on a body, frame or tube, such as a [[guqin]], a [[cimbalom]], an [[autoharp]], [[harpsichord]], a [[piano]], or a [[valiha]]\n\nIt is also possible to divide the instruments into categories focused on how the instrument is played.\n\n===Playing techniques===\n{{further|List of string instruments}}\n[[File:Teach-yourself-guitar.png|thumb|right|300px|An [[acoustic guitar]] being strummed.]]\n\nAll string instruments produce sound from one or more [[vibrating string]]s, transferred to the air by the body of the instrument (or by a pickup in the case of electronically amplified instruments). They are usually categorised by the  technique used to make the strings vibrate (or by the primary technique, in the case of instruments where more than one may apply.) The three most common techniques are plucking, bowing, and striking. An important difference between bowing and plucking is that in the former the phenomenon is periodic so that the overtones are kept in a strictly harmonic relationship to the fundamental.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Plucking ====\n{{main|Plucked string instrument}}\n\nPlucking is a method of playing on instruments such as the [[veena]], banjo, [[ukulele]], guitar, harp, [[lute]], [[mandolin]], [[oud]], and [[sitar]], using either a finger, thumb, or quills (now plastic plectra) to pluck the strings.\n\nInstruments normally played by bowing (see below) may also be plucked, a technique referred to by the Italian term ''[[pizzicato]]''.\n\n==== Bowing ====\n{{main|Bowed string instrument}}\n\n[[Bowing (music)|Bowing]] (Italian: ''arco'') is a method used in some string instruments, including the [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], and the [[double bass]] (of the [[violin family]]), and the old [[viol]] family. The [[bow (music)|bow]] consists of a stick with a \"ribbon\" of parallel horse tail hairs stretched between its ends. The hair is coated with [[rosin]] so it can grip the string; moving the hair across a string causes a [[stick-slip phenomenon]], making the string [[vibration|vibrate]], and prompting the instrument to emit sound. Darker grades of rosin grip well in cool, dry climates, but may be too sticky in warmer, more humid weather. Violin and viola players generally use harder, lighter-colored rosin than players of lower-pitched instruments, who tend to favor darker, softer rosin.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Heather K. |last=Scott |title=The Differences Between Dark and Amber Rosin |url=http://stringsmagazine.com/the-differences-between-dark-and-amber-rosin/ |magazine=Strings Magazine |date=January 5, 2004 |accessdate=February 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ravanahatha]] is one of the oldest string instruments. Ancestors of the modern bowed string instruments are the [[rebab]] of the Islamic Empires, the Persian [[kamanche]] and the [[Byzantine lira]]. Other bowed instruments are the [[rebec]], [[hardingfele]], [[nyckelharpa]], [[koky\u016b]], [[erhu]], [[igil]], [[sarangi]] and [[K'ni]]. The [[hurdy-gurdy]] is bowed by a wheel. Rarely, the [[bowed guitar|guitar has been played with a bow]] (rather than plucked) for unique effects.\n\n==== Striking ====\nThe third common method of sound production in stringed instruments is to strike the string. The piano and [[hammered dulcimer]] use this method of sound production. Even though the piano strikes the strings, the use of felt hammers means that the sound that is produced can nevertheless be mellow and rounded, in contrast to the sharp attack produced when a very hard hammer strikes the strings.\n\nViolin family string instrument players are occasionally instructed to strike the string with the stick of the bow, a technique called ''[[col legno]]''. This yields a percussive sound along with the pitch of the note. A well-known use of ''col legno'' for orchestral strings is [[Gustav Holst]]'s \"Mars\" movement from ''[[The Planets]]'' suite.\n\n==== Other methods ====\nThe [[aeolian harp]] employs a very unusual method of sound production: the strings are excited by the movement of the air.\n\nSome instruments that have strings have an attached [[musical keyboard|keyboard]] that the player presses keys on to trigger a mechanism that sounds the strings, instead of directly manipulating the strings. These include the [[piano]], the [[clavichord]], and the harpsichord. With these [[keyboard instrument]]s, strings are occasionally plucked or bowed by hand. Modern [[composer]]s such as [[Henry Cowell]] wrote music that requires that the player reach inside the piano and pluck the strings directly, \"bow\" them with bow hair wrapped around the strings, or play them by rolling the bell of a [[brass instrument]] such as a [[trombone]] on the array of strings. However, these are relatively rarely used special techniques.\n\nOther keyed string instruments, small enough for a strolling musician to play, include the plucked [[autoharp]], the bowed [[nyckelharpa]], and the hurdy-gurdy, which is played by cranking a rosined wheel.\n\nSteel-stringed instruments (such as the guitar, bass, violin, etc.) can be played using a magnetic field. An [[E-Bow]] is a small hand-held battery-powered device that magnetically excites the strings of an electric string instrument to provide a sustained, singing tone reminiscent of a held bowed violin note.\n\n[[3rd bridge|Third bridge]] is a plucking method where the player ''frets'' a string and strikes the side opposite the bridge. The technique is mainly used on electric instruments because these have a pickup that amplifies only the local string vibration. It is possible on acoustic instruments as well, but less effective. For instance, a player might press on the seventh [[fret]] on a guitar and pluck it at the head side to make a tone resonate at the opposed side. On electric instruments, this technique generates multitone sounds reminiscent of a clock or bell.\n\nElectric string instruments, such as the [[electric guitar]], can also be played without touching the strings by using [[audio feedback]]. When an electric guitar is plugged into a loud, powerful guitar amplifier with a [[loudspeaker]] and a high level of [[distortion (music)|distortion]] is intentionally used, the guitar produces sustained high-pitched sounds. By changing the proximity of the guitar to the speaker, the guitarist can produce sounds that cannot be produced with standard plucking and picking techniques. This technique was popularized by [[Jimi Hendrix]] and others in the 1960s. It was widely used in [[psychedelic rock]] and [[heavy metal music]].\n\n==Changing the pitch of a vibrating string==\n{{main|Mersenne's laws}}\n\nThere are three ways to change the pitch of a [[vibrating string]]. String instruments are tuned by varying the strings' tension because adjusting length or mass per unit length is impractical. Instruments with a [[fingerboard]] are then played by adjusting the length of the vibrating portion of the strings. The following observations all apply to a string that is infinitely flexible (a theoretical assumption, because in practical applications, strings are not infinitely flexible) strung between two fixed supports. Real strings have finite curvature at the bridge and nut, and the bridge, because of its motion, are not exactly nodes of vibration. Hence the following statements about proportionality are approximations.\n\n===Length===\n[[File:Proportional string fingering.png|thumb|200px|right|String fingering is proportional and not fixed,<ref>Piston, Walter (1955). ''Orchestration'', p.5.</ref> as on the piano]]\n\nPitch can be adjusted by varying the [[length]] of the string.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Oxford Music Online by subscription|url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/|website = www.oxfordmusiconline.com|accessdate = 2015-09-17|url-status = live|archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224031012/http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com|archivedate = 2011-02-24}}</ref>  A longer string results in a lower pitch, while a shorter string results in a higher pitch. The frequency is inversely proportional to the length:\n\n:<math>\nf \\propto \\frac{1}{l}\n</math>\n\nA string twice as long produces a tone of half the frequency (one octave lower).\n\n===Tension===\n\nPitch can be adjusted by varying the [[Tension (physics)|tension]] of the string. A string with less tension (looser) results in a lower pitch, while a string with greater tension (tighter) results in a higher pitch. A homemade [[washtub bass]] made out of a length of rope, a broomstick and a washtub can produce different pitches by increasing the tension on the rope (producing a higher pitch) or reducing the tension (producing a lower pitch). The frequency is proportional to the square root of the tension:\n\n:<math>\nf \\propto \\sqrt{T}\n</math>\n\n=== Linear density ===\n\nThe pitch of a string can also be varied by changing the [[linear density]] (mass per unit length) of the string. In practical applications, such as with [[double bass]] strings or bass [[piano]] strings, extra weight is added to strings by winding them with metal. A string with a heavier metal winding produces a lower pitch than a string of equal length without a metal winding. This can be seen on a 2016-era set of gut strings for double bass. The higher-pitched G string is often made of synthetic material, or sometimes animal intestine, with no metal wrapping. To enable the low E string to produce a much lower pitch with a string of the same length, it is wrapped with many wrappings of thin metal wire. This adds to its mass without making it too stiff. The frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of the linear density:\n\n:<math>\nf \\propto {1 \\over \\sqrt{\\mu}}\n</math>\n\nGiven two strings of equal length and tension, the string with higher mass per unit length produces the lower pitch.\n\n== String length or scale length ==\nThe length of the string from [[Nut (instrumental)|nut]] to [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] on bowed or plucked instruments ultimately determines the distance between different notes on the instrument. For example, a double bass with its low range needs a [[scale length (string instruments)|scale length]] of around {{convert|42|in|cm}}, whilst a violin scale is only about {{convert|13|in|cm}}. On the shorter scale of the violin, the left hand may easily reach a range of slightly more than two octaves without [[shifting position]], while on the bass' longer scale, a single octave or a ninth is reachable in lower positions.\n\n== Contact points along the string ==\n<!-- Note: This heading is linked to from the [[Flautando]] redirect. Please update the redirect if you change the heading. -->\n[[File:DuplexScaling.jpg|thumb|300px|The strings of a [[piano]]]]\nIn bowed instruments, the bow is normally placed perpendicularly to the string, at a point halfway between the end of the fingerboard and the bridge.  However, different bow placements can be selected to change [[timbre]].  Application of the bow close to the bridge (known as ''[[sul ponticello]]'') produces an intense, sometimes harsh sound, which acoustically emphasizes the upper [[harmonics]].  Bowing above the fingerboard (''[[sul tasto]]'') produces a purer tone with less overtone strength, emphasizing the [[Fundamental frequency|fundamental]], also known as ''flautando'', since it sounds less reedy and more flute-like.\n\nBowed instruments pose a challenge to instrument builders, as compared with instruments that are only plucked (e.g., guitar), because on bowed instruments, the musician must be able to play one string at a time if they wish. As such, a bowed instrument must have a curved bridge that makes the \"outer\" strings lower in height than the \"inner\" strings. With such a curved bridge, the player can select one string at a time to play. On guitars and [[lute]]s, the bridge can be flat, because the strings are played by plucking them with the fingers, fingernails or a pick; by moving the fingers or pick to different positions, the player can play different strings. On bowed instruments, the need to play strings individually with the bow also limits the number of strings to about six or seven strings; with more strings, it would be impossible to select individual strings to bow. (Note: bowed strings can also play two bowed notes on two different strings at the same time, a technique called a [[double stop]].) Indeed, on the orchestral [[string section]] instruments, four strings are the norm, with the exception of five strings used on some [[double bass]]es. In contrast, with stringed keyboard instruments, 88 courses are used on a [[piano]], and even though these strings are arranged on a flat bridge, the mechanism can play any of the notes individually.\n\nSimilar timbral distinctions are also possible with plucked string instruments by selecting an appropriate plucking point, although the difference is perhaps more subtle.\n\nIn keyboard instruments, the contact point along the string (whether this be hammer, tangent, or plectrum) is a choice made by the instrument designer.  Builders use a combination of experience and acoustic theory to establish the right set of contact points.\n\nIn harpsichords, often there are two sets of strings of equal length.  These \"choirs\" usually differ in their plucking points.  One choir has a \"normal\" plucking point, producing a canonical harpsichord sound; the other has a plucking point close to the bridge, producing a reedier \"nasal\" sound rich in upper harmonics.\n\n== Production of multiple notes ==\nA single string at a certain tension and length only produces one note. To produce multiple notes, string instruments use one of two methods. One is to add enough strings to cover the required range of different notes (e.g., as with the [[piano]], which has sets of 88 strings to enable the performer to play 88 different notes). The other is to provide a way to ''stop'' the strings along their length to shorten the part that vibrates, which is the method used in guitar and violin family instruments to produce different notes from the same string. The piano and harp represent the first method, where each note on the instrument has its own string or [[Course (music)|course]] of multiple strings tuned to the same note. (Many notes on a piano are strung with a \"choir\" of three strings tuned alike, to increase the volume.) A guitar represents the second method\u2014the player's fingers push the string against the fingerboard so that the string is pressed firmly against a metal fret. Pressing the string against a fret while plucking or strumming it shortens the vibrating part and thus produces a different note.\n\nSome zithers combine stoppable (melody) strings with a greater number of \"open\" harmony or chord strings. On instruments with stoppable strings, such as the violin or guitar, the player can shorten the vibrating length of the string, using their fingers directly (or more rarely through some mechanical device, as in the [[nyckelharpa]] and the hurdy-gurdy). Such instruments usually have a fingerboard attached to the neck of the instrument, that provides a hard flat surface the player can stop the strings against. On some string instruments, the fingerboard has [[fret]]s, raised ridges perpendicular to the strings, that stop the string at precise intervals, in which case the fingerboard is also called a ''fretboard''.\n\nMoving frets during performance is usually impractical. The bridges of a [[Koto (musical instrument)|koto]], on the other hand, may be moved by the player occasionally in the course of a single piece of music. Many modern Western harps include levers, either directly moved by fingers (on Celtic harps) or controlled by foot pedals (on orchestral harps), to raise the pitch of individual strings by a fixed amount. The Middle Eastern zither, the [[Kanun (instrument)|qanun]], is equipped with small levers called ''mandal'' that let each course of multiple strings be incrementally retuned \"on the fly\" while the instrument is being played. These levers raise or lower the pitch of the string course by a microtone, less than a half step.\n\n==Sympathetic strings==\n{{main|Sympathetic string}}\nSome instruments are employed with [[sympathetic string]]s\u2014which are additional strings not meant to be plucked. These strings [[resonance|resonate]] with the played notes, creating additional tones. Sympathetic strings vibrate naturally when various intervals, such as the [[unison]]s or the [[octave]]s of the notes of the sympathetic strings are plucked, bowed or struck. This system is used on the [[sarangi]], the [[grand piano]], the [[hardanger fiddle]] and the [[Rubab (instrument)|rubab]].\n\n== Sound production ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Violin]] -->\n\n=== Acoustic instruments ===\n{{See also|Musical acoustics}}\n\nA vibrating string strung on a very thick log, as a hypothetical example, would make only a very quiet sound, so string instruments are usually constructed in such a way that the vibrating string is coupled to a hollow resonating chamber, a soundboard, or both. On the violin, for example the four strings pass over a thin wooden bridge resting on a hollow box (the body of the violin). The normal force applied to the body from the strings is supported in part by a small cylinder of wood called the [[soundpost]]. The violin body also has two \"f-holes\" carved on the top. The strings' vibrations are distributed via the bridge and soundpost to all surfaces of the instrument, and are thus made louder by matching of the [[acoustic impedance]]. The correct technical explanation is that they allow a better match to the [[acoustic impedance]] of the air.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIt is sometimes said that the sounding board or soundbox \"amplifies\" the sound of the strings. In reality, no power amplification occurs, because all of the [[energy]] to produce [[sound]] comes from the vibrating string. The mechanism is that the sounding board of the instrument provides a larger surface area to create [[sound wave]]s than that of the string and therefore acts a matching element between the acoustic impedance of the string and that of the surrounding air. . A larger vibrating surface can sometimes produce better matching; especially at lower frequencies.\n\nAll [[lute]] type instruments traditionally have a bridge, which holds the string at the proper action height from the fret/finger board at one end of the strings. On acoustic instruments, the bridge performs an equally important function of transmitting string energy into the \"sound box\" of the instrument, thereby increasing the sound volume. The specific design, and materials the used in the construction of the bridge of an instrument, have a dramatic impact upon both the sound and responsiveness of the instrument.\n\nAchieving a tonal characteristic that is effective and pleasing to the player's and listener's ear is something of an art and craft, as well as a science, and the makers of string instruments often seek very high quality woods to this end, particularly [[spruce]] (chosen for its lightness, strength and flexibility) and [[maple]] (a very hard wood). Spruce is used for the sounding boards of instruments from the violin to the piano. Instruments such as the banjo use a drum, covered in natural or synthetic skin as their soundboard.\n\nAcoustic instruments can also be made out of artificial materials, such as [[carbon fiber]] and [[fiberglass]] (particularly the larger, lower-pitched instruments, such as cellos and basses).\n\nIn the early 20th century, the [[Stroh violin]] used a diaphragm-type [[resonator]] and a metal horn to project the string sound, much like early mechanical gramophones. Its use declined beginning about 1920, as electronic amplification through [[power amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker]]s was developed and came into use. String instrument players can electronically amplify their instruments by connecting them to a [[PA system]] or a [[guitar amplifier]].\n\n=== Electronic amplification ===\nMost string instruments can be fitted with [[piezoelectric]] or magnetic [[Pick up (music technology)|pickup]]s to convert the string's vibrations into an electrical signal that is amplified and then converted back into sound by loudspeakers. Some players attach a pickup to their traditional string instrument to \"electrify\" it. Another option is to use a solid-bodied instrument, which reduces unwanted [[Audio feedback|feedback]] howls or squeals.\n\nAmplified string instruments can be much louder than their acoustic counterparts, so musicians can play them in relatively loud rock, blues, and jazz ensembles. Amplified instruments can also have their amplified tone modified by using electronic effects such as distortion, reverb, or [[wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]].\n\nBass-register string instruments such as the double bass and the electric bass are amplified with [[bass instrument amplification|bass instrument amplifiers]] that are designed to reproduce low-frequency sounds. To modify the tone of amplified bass instruments, a range of electronic [[bass effects]] are available, such as distortion and chorus.\n\n==Symphonic strings==\n\nThe string instruments usually used in the [[orchestra]],<ref>{{cite web |first=Jorge |last=Aguilar |title=Best Karaoke Machines For Kids Buyers Guide |url=http://www.kidsfashionstyles.com/best-karaoke-machines-kids/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130141956/http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/spring03/aguilar/TchaiConSo.htm |archive-date=January 30, 2019 |publisher=[[University of Florida]] |date=2003 |accessdate=February 1, 2020}}</ref> and often called the \"symphonic strings\" or [[string section]] are:<ref>{{cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseoxforddic00scho|year=1964|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-311302-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/conciseoxforddic00scho/page/412 412]}}</ref>\n\n* [[Violins]] (divided into two sections\u2014first violins and second violins; these sections play exactly the same instruments; the difference is that the first violins play higher-register lines and the second violins play lower-register parts, [[accompaniment]] parts or [[countermelody|countermelodies]])\n* [[Violas]]\n* [[Cello]]s\n* [[Double bass]]es\n\nWhen orchestral instrumentation specifies \"strings,\" it often means this combination of string parts.

In some [[keyboard (music)|keyboard]] instruments, such as the [[harpsichord]], the musician presses a key that plucks the string.\n\nWith bowed instruments, the player pulls a rosined horsehair bow across the strings, causing them to vibrate. With a [[hurdy-gurdy]], the musician cranks a wheel whose rosined edge touches the strings. \n\nBowed instruments include the [[string section]] instruments of the [[Classical music]] [[orchestra]] ([[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]] and [[double bass]]) and a number of other instruments (e.g., [[viol]]s and [[Viol|gambas]] used in [[early music]] from the [[Baroque music]] era and [[fiddle]]s used in many types of [[folk music]]). All of the bowed string instruments can also be plucked with the fingers, a technique called \"[[pizzicato]]\". A wide variety of techniques are used to sound notes on the [[electric guitar]], including plucking with the fingernails or a plectrum, strumming and even \"[[tapping]]\" on the fingerboard and using [[feedback (guitar)|feedback]] from a loud, [[distortion (music)|distorted]] [[guitar amplifier]] to produce a sustained sound. Some types of string instrument are mainly plucked, such as the [[harp]] and the [[electric bass]]. In the [[Hornbostel-Sachs]] scheme of [[musical instrument classification]], used in [[organology]], string instruments are called [[chordophone]]s. Other examples include the [[sitar]], [[rebab]], [[banjo]], [[mandolin]], [[ukulele]], and [[bouzouki]].\n\nIn most string instruments, the vibrations are transmitted to the body of the instrument, which often incorporates some sort of hollow or enclosed area. The body of the instrument also vibrates, along with the air inside it. The vibration of the body of the instrument and the enclosed hollow or chamber make the vibration of the string more audible to the performer and audience.

Middle Eastern rebecs represented breakthroughs in terms of shape and strings, with a half a pear shape using three strings. Early versions of the violin and fiddle, by comparison, emerged in Europe through instruments such as the [[gittern]], a four-stringed precursor to the guitar, and basic [[lute]]s. These instruments typically used catgut (animal intestine) and other materials, including silk, for their strings.\n\n===Renaissance to modern===\n[[File:Viol, fidel and rebec.jpg|thumb|Viol, [[vielle|fidel]] and rebec (from left to right) on display at ''Amakusa Korejiyokan'' in Amakusa, Kumamoto, Japan]]\nString instrument design refined during the [[Renaissance]] and into the [[Baroque period]] (1600\u20131750) of musical history. [[Violins]] and [[guitars]] became more consistent in design and were roughly similar to acoustic guitars of the 2000s. The violins of the [[Renaissance]] featured intricate woodwork and stringing, while more elaborate bass instruments such as the bandora were produced alongside quill-plucked [[cittern]]s, and Spanish body guitars.\n\nIn the 19th century, string instruments were made more widely available through mass production, with wood string instruments a key part of orchestras \u2013 cellos, violas, and upright basses, for example, were now standard instruments for chamber ensembles and smaller orchestras. At the same time, the 19th-century guitar became more typically associated with six string models, rather than traditional five string versions.\n\nMajor changes to string instruments in the 20th century primarily involved innovations in electronic [[instrument amplification]] and electronic music \u2013 electric violins were available by the 1920s, and were an important part of emerging jazz music trends in the United States. The [[acoustic guitar]] was widely used in [[blues]] and [[jazz]], but as an acoustic instrument, it was not loud enough to be a solo instrument, so these genres mostly used it as an [[accompaniment]] [[rhythm section]] instrument. In [[big band]]s of the 1920s, the [[acoustic guitar]] played backing chords, but it was not loud enough to play solos like the [[saxophone]] and [[trumpet]]. The development of guitar amplifiers, which contained a [[power amplifier]] and a [[loudspeaker]] in a [[speaker enclosure|wooden cabinet]], let [[jazz guitar]]ists play solos and be heard over a big band. The development of the [[electric guitar]] provided guitarists with an instrument that was built to connect to guitar amplifiers. Electric guitars have [[magnetic pickup]]s, [[potentiometer|volume control knob]]s and an output jack.\n\nIn the 1960s, larger, more powerful guitar amplifiers were developed, called \"stacks\". These powerful amplifiers enabled guitarists to perform in rock bands that played in large venues such as stadiums and outdoor music festivals (e.g., [[Woodstock Music Festival]]). Along with the development of guitar amplifiers, a large range of electronic [[effects unit]]s, many in small [[stompbox]] pedals were introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, such as [[fuzz pedal]]s, [[flanger]]s and [[phaser (music)|phaser]]  enabling performers to create unique new sounds during the [[psychedelic rock]] era. Breakthroughs in electric guitar and basses technologies and playing styles enabled major breakthroughs in pop and rock music in the 1960s and 1970s. The distinctive sound of the amplified [[electric guitar]] was the centerpiece of new genres of music such as [[blues rock]] and [[Jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]]. The sonic power of the loudly amplified, highly [[distortion (music)|distorted]] electric guitar was to key element of the early [[heavy metal music]], with the distorted guitar being used in [[lead guitar]] roles, and with [[power chord]]s as a [[rhythm guitar]].\n\nThe ongoing use of electronic amplification and effects units in string instruments, ranging from traditional instruments like the violin to the new electric guitar, added variety to [[contemporary classical music]] performances, and enabled experimentation in the dynamic and timbre (tone colour) range of orchestras, bands, and solo performances.<ref name=\"mp\">{{cite book|author=Michael Chanan|title=Musica Practica: The Social Practice of Western Music from Gregorian Chant to Postmodernism|year=1994|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-005-4|pages=170}}</ref>\n\n==Types of instruments==\n\n===Construction===\n<!--[[Bout (musical instrument)]] redirects and [[Bout]] links directly to this section.-->\nString instruments can be divided in three groups\n;[[Lute]]s : Instruments that support the strings via a [[Neck (music)|neck]] and a '''bout''' (\"'''gourd'''\"), for instance a guitar, a violin, or a [[baglama|saz]]\n;[[Harp]]s : Instruments that contain the strings within a frame\n;[[Zither]]s : Instruments that have the strings mounted on a body, frame or tube, such as a [[guqin]], a [[cimbalom]], an [[autoharp]], [[harpsichord]], a [[piano]], or a [[valiha]]\n\nIt is also possible to divide the instruments into categories focused on how the instrument is played.\n\n===Playing techniques===\n{{further|List of string instruments}}\n[[File:Teach-yourself-guitar.png|thumb|right|300px|An [[acoustic guitar]] being strummed.]]\n\nAll string instruments produce sound from one or more [[vibrating string]]s, transferred to the air by the body of the instrument (or by a pickup in the case of electronically amplified instruments). They are usually categorised by the  technique used to make the strings vibrate (or by the primary technique, in the case of instruments where more than one may apply.) The three most common techniques are plucking, bowing, and striking. An important difference between bowing and plucking is that in the former the phenomenon is periodic so that the overtones are kept in a strictly harmonic relationship to the fundamental.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Plucking ====\n{{main|Plucked string instrument}}\n\nPlucking is a method of playing on instruments such as the [[veena]], banjo, [[ukulele]], guitar, harp, [[lute]], [[mandolin]], [[oud]], and [[sitar]], using either a finger, thumb, or quills (now plastic plectra) to pluck the strings.\n\nInstruments normally played by bowing (see below) may also be plucked, a technique referred to by the Italian term ''[[pizzicato]]''.\n\n==== Bowing ====\n{{main|Bowed string instrument}}\n\n[[Bowing (music)|Bowing]] (Italian: ''arco'') is a method used in some string instruments, including the [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], and the [[double bass]] (of the [[violin family]]), and the old [[viol]] family. The [[bow (music)|bow]] consists of a stick with a \"ribbon\" of parallel horse tail hairs stretched between its ends. The hair is coated with [[rosin]] so it can grip the string; moving the hair across a string causes a [[stick-slip phenomenon]], making the string [[vibration|vibrate]], and prompting the instrument to emit sound. Darker grades of rosin grip well in cool, dry climates, but may be too sticky in warmer, more humid weather. Violin and viola players generally use harder, lighter-colored rosin than players of lower-pitched instruments, who tend to favor darker, softer rosin.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Heather K. |last=Scott |title=The Differences Between Dark and Amber Rosin |url=http://stringsmagazine.com/the-differences-between-dark-and-amber-rosin/ |magazine=Strings Magazine |date=January 5, 2004 |accessdate=February 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ravanahatha]] is one of the oldest string instruments. Ancestors of the modern bowed string instruments are the [[rebab]] of the Islamic Empires, the Persian [[kamanche]] and the [[Byzantine lira]]. Other bowed instruments are the [[rebec]], [[hardingfele]], [[nyckelharpa]], [[koky\u016b]], [[erhu]], [[igil]], [[sarangi]] and [[K'ni]]. The [[hurdy-gurdy]] is bowed by a wheel. Rarely, the [[bowed guitar|guitar has been played with a bow]] (rather than plucked) for unique effects.\n\n==== Striking ====\nThe third common method of sound production in stringed instruments is to strike the string. The piano and [[hammered dulcimer]] use this method of sound production. Even though the piano strikes the strings, the use of felt hammers means that the sound that is produced can nevertheless be mellow and rounded, in contrast to the sharp attack produced when a very hard hammer strikes the strings.\n\nViolin family string instrument players are occasionally instructed to strike the string with the stick of the bow, a technique called ''[[col legno]]''. This yields a percussive sound along with the pitch of the note. A well-known use of ''col legno'' for orchestral strings is [[Gustav Holst]]'s \"Mars\" movement from ''[[The Planets]]'' suite.\n\n==== Other methods ====\nThe [[aeolian harp]] employs a very unusual method of sound production: the strings are excited by the movement of the air.\n\nSome instruments that have strings have an attached [[musical keyboard|keyboard]] that the player presses keys on to trigger a mechanism that sounds the strings, instead of directly manipulating the strings. These include the [[piano]], the [[clavichord]], and the harpsichord. With these [[keyboard instrument]]s, strings are occasionally plucked or bowed by hand. Modern [[composer]]s such as [[Henry Cowell]] wrote music that requires that the player reach inside the piano and pluck the strings directly, \"bow\" them with bow hair wrapped around the strings, or play them by rolling the bell of a [[brass instrument]] such as a [[trombone]] on the array of strings. However, these are relatively rarely used special techniques.\n\nOther keyed string instruments, small enough for a strolling musician to play, include the plucked [[autoharp]], the bowed [[nyckelharpa]], and the hurdy-gurdy, which is played by cranking a rosined wheel.\n\nSteel-stringed instruments (such as the guitar, bass, violin, etc.) can be played using a magnetic field. An [[E-Bow]] is a small hand-held battery-powered device that magnetically excites the strings of an electric string instrument to provide a sustained, singing tone reminiscent of a held bowed violin note.\n\n[[3rd bridge|Third bridge]] is a plucking method where the player ''frets'' a string and strikes the side opposite the bridge. The technique is mainly used on electric instruments because these have a pickup that amplifies only the local string vibration. It is possible on acoustic instruments as well, but less effective. For instance, a player might press on the seventh [[fret]] on a guitar and pluck it at the head side to make a tone resonate at the opposed side. On electric instruments, this technique generates multitone sounds reminiscent of a clock or bell.\n\nElectric string instruments, such as the [[electric guitar]], can also be played without touching the strings by using [[audio feedback]]. When an electric guitar is plugged into a loud, powerful guitar amplifier with a [[loudspeaker]] and a high level of [[distortion (music)|distortion]] is intentionally used, the guitar produces sustained high-pitched sounds. By changing the proximity of the guitar to the speaker, the guitarist can produce sounds that cannot be produced with standard plucking and picking techniques. This technique was popularized by [[Jimi Hendrix]] and others in the 1960s. It was widely used in [[psychedelic rock]] and [[heavy metal music]].\n\n==Changing the pitch of a vibrating string==\n{{main|Mersenne's laws}}\n\nThere are three ways to change the pitch of a [[vibrating string]]. String instruments are tuned by varying the strings' tension because adjusting length or mass per unit length is impractical. Instruments with a [[fingerboard]] are then played by adjusting the length of the vibrating portion of the strings. The following observations all apply to a string that is infinitely flexible (a theoretical assumption, because in practical applications, strings are not infinitely flexible) strung between two fixed supports. Real strings have finite curvature at the bridge and nut, and the bridge, because of its motion, are not exactly nodes of vibration. Hence the following statements about proportionality are approximations.\n\n===Length===\n[[File:Proportional string fingering.png|thumb|200px|right|String fingering is proportional and not fixed,<ref>Piston, Walter (1955). ''Orchestration'', p.5.</ref> as on the piano]]\n\nPitch can be adjusted by varying the [[length]] of the string.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Oxford Music Online by subscription|url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/|website = www.oxfordmusiconline.com|accessdate = 2015-09-17|url-status = live|archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224031012/http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com|archivedate = 2011-02-24}}</ref>  A longer string results in a lower pitch, while a shorter string results in a higher pitch. The frequency is inversely proportional to the length:\n\n:<math>\nf \\propto \\frac{1}{l}\n</math>\n\nA string twice as long produces a tone of half the frequency (one octave lower).\n\n===Tension===\n\nPitch can be adjusted by varying the [[Tension (physics)|tension]] of the string. A string with less tension (looser) results in a lower pitch, while a string with greater tension (tighter) results in a higher pitch. A homemade [[washtub bass]] made out of a length of rope, a broomstick and a washtub can produce different pitches by increasing the tension on the rope (producing a higher pitch) or reducing the tension (producing a lower pitch). The frequency is proportional to the square root of the tension:\n\n:<math>\nf \\propto \\sqrt{T}\n</math>\n\n=== Linear density ===\n\nThe pitch of a string can also be varied by changing the [[linear density]] (mass per unit length) of the string. In practical applications, such as with [[double bass]] strings or bass [[piano]] strings, extra weight is added to strings by winding them with metal. A string with a heavier metal winding produces a lower pitch than a string of equal length without a metal winding. This can be seen on a 2016-era set of gut strings for double bass. The higher-pitched G string is often made of synthetic material, or sometimes animal intestine, with no metal wrapping. To enable the low E string to produce a much lower pitch with a string of the same length, it is wrapped with many wrappings of thin metal wire. This adds to its mass without making it too stiff. The frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of the linear density:\n\n:<math>\nf \\propto {1 \\over \\sqrt{\\mu}}\n</math>\n\nGiven two strings of equal length and tension, the string with higher mass per unit length produces the lower pitch.\n\n== String length or scale length ==\nThe length of the string from [[Nut (instrumental)|nut]] to [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] on bowed or plucked instruments ultimately determines the distance between different notes on the instrument. For example, a double bass with its low range needs a [[scale length (string instruments)|scale length]] of around {{convert|42|in|cm}}, whilst a violin scale is only about {{convert|13|in|cm}}. On the shorter scale of the violin, the left hand may easily reach a range of slightly more than two octaves without [[shifting position]], while on the bass' longer scale, a single octave or a ninth is reachable in lower positions.\n\n== Contact points along the string ==\n<!-- Note: This heading is linked to from the [[Flautando]] redirect. Please update the redirect if you change the heading. -->\n[[File:DuplexScaling.jpg|thumb|300px|The strings of a [[piano]]]]\nIn bowed instruments, the bow is normally placed perpendicularly to the string, at a point halfway between the end of the fingerboard and the bridge.  However, different bow placements can be selected to change [[timbre]].  Application of the bow close to the bridge (known as ''[[sul ponticello]]'') produces an intense, sometimes harsh sound, which acoustically emphasizes the upper [[harmonics]].  Bowing above the fingerboard (''[[sul tasto]]'') produces a purer tone with less overtone strength, emphasizing the [[Fundamental frequency|fundamental]], also known as ''flautando'', since it sounds less reedy and more flute-like.\n\nBowed instruments pose a challenge to instrument builders, as compared with instruments that are only plucked (e.g., guitar), because on bowed instruments, the musician must be able to play one string at a time if they wish. As such, a bowed instrument must have a curved bridge that makes the \"outer\" strings lower in height than the \"inner\" strings. With such a curved bridge, the player can select one string at a time to play. On guitars and [[lute]]s, the bridge can be flat, because the strings are played by plucking them with the fingers, fingernails or a pick; by moving the fingers or pick to different positions, the player can play different strings. On bowed instruments, the need to play strings individually with the bow also limits the number of strings to about six or seven strings; with more strings, it would be impossible to select individual strings to bow. (Note: bowed strings can also play two bowed notes on two different strings at the same time, a technique called a [[double stop]].) Indeed, on the orchestral [[string section]] instruments, four strings are the norm, with the exception of five strings used on some [[double bass]]es. In contrast, with stringed keyboard instruments, 88 courses are used on a [[piano]], and even though these strings are arranged on a flat bridge, the mechanism can play any of the notes individually.\n\nSimilar timbral distinctions are also possible with plucked string instruments by selecting an appropriate plucking point, although the difference is perhaps more subtle.\n\nIn keyboard instruments, the contact point along the string (whether this be hammer, tangent, or plectrum) is a choice made by the instrument designer.  Builders use a combination of experience and acoustic theory to establish the right set of contact points.\n\nIn harpsichords, often there are two sets of strings of equal length.  These \"choirs\" usually differ in their plucking points.  One choir has a \"normal\" plucking point, producing a canonical harpsichord sound; the other has a plucking point close to the bridge, producing a reedier \"nasal\" sound rich in upper harmonics.\n\n== Production of multiple notes ==\nA single string at a certain tension and length only produces one note. To produce multiple notes, string instruments use one of two methods. One is to add enough strings to cover the required range of different notes (e.g., as with the [[piano]], which has sets of 88 strings to enable the performer to play 88 different notes). The other is to provide a way to ''stop'' the strings along their length to shorten the part that vibrates, which is the method used in guitar and violin family instruments to produce different notes from the same string. The piano and harp represent the first method, where each note on the instrument has its own string or [[Course (music)|course]] of multiple strings tuned to the same note. (Many notes on a piano are strung with a \"choir\" of three strings tuned alike, to increase the volume.) A guitar represents the second method\u2014the player's fingers push the string against the fingerboard so that the string is pressed firmly against a metal fret. Pressing the string against a fret while plucking or strumming it shortens the vibrating part and thus produces a different note.\n\nSome zithers combine stoppable (melody) strings with a greater number of \"open\" harmony or chord strings. On instruments with stoppable strings, such as the violin or guitar, the player can shorten the vibrating length of the string, using their fingers directly (or more rarely through some mechanical device, as in the [[nyckelharpa]] and the hurdy-gurdy). Such instruments usually have a fingerboard attached to the neck of the instrument, that provides a hard flat surface the player can stop the strings against. On some string instruments, the fingerboard has [[fret]]s, raised ridges perpendicular to the strings, that stop the string at precise intervals, in which case the fingerboard is also called a ''fretboard''.\n\nMoving frets during performance is usually impractical. The bridges of a [[Koto (musical instrument)|koto]], on the other hand, may be moved by the player occasionally in the course of a single piece of music. Many modern Western harps include levers, either directly moved by fingers (on Celtic harps) or controlled by foot pedals (on orchestral harps), to raise the pitch of individual strings by a fixed amount. The Middle Eastern zither, the [[Kanun (instrument)|qanun]], is equipped with small levers called ''mandal'' that let each course of multiple strings be incrementally retuned \"on the fly\" while the instrument is being played. These levers raise or lower the pitch of the string course by a microtone, less than a half step.\n\n==Sympathetic strings==\n{{main|Sympathetic string}}\nSome instruments are employed with [[sympathetic string]]s\u2014which are additional strings not meant to be plucked. These strings [[resonance|resonate]] with the played notes, creating additional tones. Sympathetic strings vibrate naturally when various intervals, such as the [[unison]]s or the [[octave]]s of the notes of the sympathetic strings are plucked, bowed or struck. This system is used on the [[sarangi]], the [[grand piano]], the [[hardanger fiddle]] and the [[Rubab (instrument)|rubab]].\n\n== Sound production ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Violin]] -->\n\n=== Acoustic instruments ===\n{{See also|Musical acoustics}}\n\nA vibrating string strung on a very thick log, as a hypothetical example, would make only a very quiet sound, so string instruments are usually constructed in such a way that the vibrating string is coupled to a hollow resonating chamber, a soundboard, or both. On the violin, for example the four strings pass over a thin wooden bridge resting on a hollow box (the body of the violin). The normal force applied to the body from the strings is supported in part by a small cylinder of wood called the [[soundpost]]. The violin body also has two \"f-holes\" carved on the top. The strings' vibrations are distributed via the bridge and soundpost to all surfaces of the instrument, and are thus made louder by matching of the [[acoustic impedance]]. The correct technical explanation is that they allow a better match to the [[acoustic impedance]] of the air.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIt is sometimes said that the sounding board or soundbox \"amplifies\" the sound of the strings. In reality, no power amplification occurs, because all of the [[energy]] to produce [[sound]] comes from the vibrating string. The mechanism is that the sounding board of the instrument provides a larger surface area to create [[sound wave]]s than that of the string and therefore acts a matching element between the acoustic impedance of the string and that of the surrounding air. . A larger vibrating surface can sometimes produce better matching; especially at lower frequencies.\n\nAll [[lute]] type instruments traditionally have a bridge, which holds the string at the proper action height from the fret/finger board at one end of the strings. On acoustic instruments, the bridge performs an equally important function of transmitting string energy into the \"sound box\" of the instrument, thereby increasing the sound volume. The specific design, and materials the used in the construction of the bridge of an instrument, have a dramatic impact upon both the sound and responsiveness of the instrument.\n\nAchieving a tonal characteristic that is effective and pleasing to the player's and listener's ear is something of an art and craft, as well as a science, and the makers of string instruments often seek very high quality woods to this end, particularly [[spruce]] (chosen for its lightness, strength and flexibility) and [[maple]] (a very hard wood). Spruce is used for the sounding boards of instruments from the violin to the piano. Instruments such as the banjo use a drum, covered in natural or synthetic skin as their soundboard.\n\nAcoustic instruments can also be made out of artificial materials, such as [[carbon fiber]] and [[fiberglass]] (particularly the larger, lower-pitched instruments, such as cellos and basses).\n\nIn the early 20th century, the [[Stroh violin]] used a diaphragm-type [[resonator]] and a metal horn to project the string sound, much like early mechanical gramophones. Its use declined beginning about 1920, as electronic amplification through [[power amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker]]s was developed and came into use. String instrument players can electronically amplify their instruments by connecting them to a [[PA system]] or a [[guitar amplifier]].\n\n=== Electronic amplification ===\nMost string instruments can be fitted with [[piezoelectric]] or magnetic [[Pick up (music technology)|pickup]]s to convert the string's vibrations into an electrical signal that is amplified and then converted back into sound by loudspeakers. Some players attach a pickup to their traditional string instrument to \"electrify\" it. Another option is to use a solid-bodied instrument, which reduces unwanted [[Audio feedback|feedback]] howls or squeals.\n\nAmplified string instruments can be much louder than their acoustic counterparts, so musicians can play them in relatively loud rock, blues, and jazz ensembles. Amplified instruments can also have their amplified tone modified by using electronic effects such as distortion, reverb, or [[wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]].\n\nBass-register string instruments such as the double bass and the electric bass are amplified with [[bass instrument amplification|bass instrument amplifiers]] that are designed to reproduce low-frequency sounds. To modify the tone of amplified bass instruments, a range of electronic [[bass effects]] are available, such as distortion and chorus.\n\n==Symphonic strings==\n\nThe string instruments usually used in the [[orchestra]],<ref>{{cite web |first=Jorge |last=Aguilar |title=String Instruments |url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/spring03/aguilar/TchaiConSo.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130141956/http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/spring03/aguilar/TchaiConSo.htm |archive-date=January 30, 2019 |publisher=[[University of Florida]] |date=2003 |accessdate=February 1, 2020}}</ref> and often called the \"symphonic strings\" or [[string section]] are:<ref>{{cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseoxforddic00scho|year=1964|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-311302-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/conciseoxforddic00scho/page/412 412]}}</ref>\n\n* [[Violins]] (divided into two sections\u2014first violins and second violins; these sections play exactly the same instruments; the difference is that the first violins play higher-register lines and the second violins play lower-register parts, [[accompaniment]] parts or [[countermelody|countermelodies]])\n* [[Violas]]\n* [[Cello]]s\n* [[Double bass]]es\n\nWhen orchestral instrumentation specifies \"strings,\" it often means this combination of string parts. Orchestral works rarely omit any of these string parts, but often include additional string instruments, especially the [[concert harp]] and piano.  In the [[Baroque orchestra]] from the 1600s\u20131750 (or with modern groups playing [[early music]]) harpsichord is almost always used to play the [[basso continuo]] part (the written-out [[bass line]] and improvised chords), and often a [[theorbo]] or [[lute]] or a [[pipe organ]]. In some classical music, such as the [[string quartet]], the double bass is not typically used; the cello plays the bass role in this literature.\n\n== See also ==\n{{commons category|String instruments}}\n* \"[[Essay on the fingering of the violoncello and on the conduct of the bow]]\"\n* [[List of string instruments]]\n* [[Luthier]] (maker of stringed instruments)\n* [[Musical acoustics]]\n* [[Ravanahatha]]\n* [[String instrument extended technique]]\n* [[String instrument repertoire]]\n* [[String orchestra]]\n* [[Strings (music)]]\n* [[Stringed instrument tunings]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/Bows.html The physics of the bowed string]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110807214938/http://www.bsmny.org/features/iidviola/ Instruments in Depth: The Viola], an online feature presented by Bloomingdale School of Music (2010)\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Stringed instruments}}\n* [http://blog.musicteachershelper.com/a-brief-history-of-string-instruments A Brief History of String Instruments]\n{{Instrument tunings}}\n{{Musical instruments in classical music}}\n{{Strings (music)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:String Instrument}}\n[[Category:String instruments| ]]\n[[Category:Orchestras]]\n[[Category:Rhythm section]]\n", "name_user": "Zulfiqar112233", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eSymphonic strings)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_instrument"}
