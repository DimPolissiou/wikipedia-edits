It is the extension to non-integer numbers of the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]].<ref>''The History of Arithmetic'', [[Louis Charles Karpinski]], 200pp, Rand McNally & Company, 1925.</ref> The way of denoting numbers in the decimal system is often referred to as ''decimal notation''.<ref>Lam Lay Yong & Ang Tian Se (2004) ''Fleeting Footsteps. Tracing the Conception of Arithmetic and Algebra in Ancient China'', Revised Edition, World Scientific, Singapore.</ref>\n\nA ''decimal numeral'', or just ''decimal'', or casually ''decimal number'', refers generally to the notation of a number in the decimal numeral system. Decimals may sometimes be identified for containing a [[decimal mark|decimal separator]] (for example the \".\" in {{math|10.00}} or {{math|3.14159}}). \"Decimal\" may also refer specifically to the digits after the decimal separator, such as in \"{{math|3.14}} is the approximation of {{pi}} to ''two decimals''\".\n\nThe numbers that may be represented in the decimal system are the [[#Decimal fractions|decimal fractions]], that is the [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] of the form {{math|''a''/10<sup>''n''</sup>}}, where {{math|''a''}} is an integer, and {{math|''n''}} is a [[non-negative integer]].\n\nThe decimal system has been extended to ''infinite decimals'', for representing any [[real number]], by using an [[sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequence]] of digits after the decimal separator (see [[Decimal representation]]). In this context, the decimal numerals with a finite number of non\u2013zero places after the decimal separator are sometimes called ''terminating decimals''. A [[repeating decimal]] is an infinite decimal that after some place repeats indefinitely the same sequence of digits (for example {{math|1=5.123144144144144... = 5.123{{overline|144}}}}).<ref>The [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum (overline)]] in 5.123<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">144</span> indicates that the '144' sequence repeats indefinitely, i.e. {{val|5.123144144144144|s=...}}.</ref> An infinite decimal represents a [[rational number]] if and only if it is a repeating decimal or has a finite number of nonzero digits.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Two hand, ten fingers.jpg|thumb|right|Ten fingers on two hands, the possible starting point of decimal counting.]]\nMany [[numeral system]]s of ancient civilizations use ten and its powers for representing numbers, possibly because there are ten fingers on two hands and people started counting by using their fingers. Examples are [[Brahmi numerals]], [[Greek numerals]], [[Hebrew numerals]], [[Roman numerals]], and [[Chinese numerals]]. Very large numbers were difficult to represent in these old numeral systems, and only the best mathematicians were able to multiply or divide large numbers. These difficulties were completely solved with the introduction of the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]] for representing [[integer]]s. This system has been extended to represent some non-integer numbers, called ''[[#Decimal fractions|decimal fractions]]'' or ''decimal numbers'' for forming the ''decimal numeral system''.\n\n== Decimal notation ==\nFor writing numbers, the decimal  system uses ten [[decimal digit]]s, a [[decimal mark]], and, for [[negative number]]s, a [[minus sign]] \"\u2212\". The decimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9;<ref>In some countries, such as [[Arab language|Arab speaking]] ones, other [[glyph]]s are used for the digits</ref> the decimal separator is the dot \"{{math|.}}\" in many countries (including all English speaking ones), but may be a comma \"{{math|,}}\" in other countries (mainly in [[continental Europe]]).\n\nFor representing a [[non-negative number]], a decimal consists of\n* either a (finite) sequence of digits such as 2017, or in full generality,\n::<math>a_ma_{m-1}\\ldots a_0</math>\n:(in this case, the (entire) decimal represents an integer)\n* or two sequence of digits separated by a decimal mark such as 3.14159, 15.00, or in full generality\n::<math>a_ma_{m-1}\\ldots a_0.b_1b_2\\ldots b_n</math>\nIt is generally assumed that, if {{math|''m'' > 0}}, the first digit {{math|''a''<sub>''m''</sub>}} is not zero, but, in some circumstances, it may be useful to have one or more 0's on the left. This does not change the value represented by the decimal. For example, {{math|1=3.14 = 03.14 = 003.14}}. Similarly, if {{math|1=''b''<sub>''n''</sub> =0}}, it may be removed, and conversely, trailing zeros may be added without changing the represented number: for example, {{math|1=15 = 15.0 = 15.00}} and {{math|1=5.2 = 5.20 = 5.200}}&nbsp;. Sometimes the extra zeros are used for indicating the accuracy of a measurement. For example, 15.00&nbsp;m may indicate that the measurement error is less than one centimeter (0.01&nbsp;m), while 15&nbsp;m may mean that the length is roughly fifteen meters, and that the error may exceed 10&nbsp;cm.\n\nFor representing a [[negative number]], a minus sign is placed before {{math|''a''<sub>''m''</sub>}}.\n\nThe numeral <math>a_ma_{m-1}\\ldots a_0.b_1b_2\\ldots b_n</math> represents the number\n:<math>a_m10^m+a_{m-1}10^{m-1}+\\cdots+a_{0}10^0+\\frac{b_1}{10^1}+\\frac{b_2}{10^2}+\\cdots+\\frac{b_n}{10^n}</math>\nTherefore, the contribution of each digit to the value of a number depends on its position in the numeral. That is, the decimal system is a [[positional numeral system]]\n\n== Decimal fractions ==\n\nThe numbers that are represented by decimal numerals are the '''decimal fractions''' (sometimes called '''decimal numbers'''), that is, the [[rational number]]s that may be expressed as a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]], the [[denominator]] of which is a [[exponentiation|power]] of ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Decimal_fraction|title=Decimal Fraction|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Mathematics]]|accessdate=2013-06-18}}</ref> For example, the numerals <math>0.8, 14.89, 0.00024</math> represent the fractions {{math|{{sfrac|8|10}}}}, {{math|{{sfrac|1489|100}}}}, {{math|{{sfrac|24|100000}}}}. More generally, a decimal with {{math|''n''}} digits after the separator represents the fraction with denominator {{math|10<sup>''n''</sup>}}, whose numerator is the integer obtained by removing the separator.\n\nExpressed as a [[fully reduced fraction]], the decimal numbers are those whose denominator is a product of a power of 2 and a power of 5. Thus the smallest denominators of decimal numbers are\n:<math>1=2^0\\cdot 5^0, 2=2^1\\cdot 5^0, 4=2^2\\cdot 5^0, 5=2^0\\cdot 5^1, 8=2^3\\cdot 5^0, 10=2^1\\cdot 5^1, 16=2^4\\cdot 5^0, 25=2^0\\cdot 5^2, \\ldots</math>\n\n<!-- The remainder of the section seems misplaced here -->The ''[[integer part]]'' or ''integral part'' of a decimal is the integer written to the left of the decimal separator (see also [[truncation]]). For a non-negative decimal, it is the largest integer that is not greater than the decimal. The part from the decimal separator to the right is the ''[[fractional part]]'', which equals the difference between the numeral and its integer part.\n\nWhen the integral part of a numeral is zero, it may occur, typically in [[computing]], that the integer part is not written (for example {{math|.1234}}, instead of {{math|0.1234}}). In normal writing, this is generally avoided because of the risk of confusion between the decimal mark and other punctuation.\n\n==Real number approximation==\n\nDecimal numerals do not allow an exact representation for all [[real number]]s, e.g. for the real number [[pi|{{pi}}]]. Nevertheless, they allow approximating every real number with any desired accuracy, e.g., the decimal 3.14159 approximates the real {{pi}}, being less than 10<sup>\u22125</sup> off; and so decimals are widely used in [[science]], [[engineering]] and everyday life.\n\nMore precisely, for every real number ''x'', and every positive integer ''n'', there are two decimals ''L'' and ''u'', with at most ''n'' digits after the decimal mark, such that ''L'' \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 ''u'' and (''u'' \u2013 ''L'') = 10<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>.\n\nNumbers are very often obtained as the result of a [[measurement]]. As measurements are generally afflicted with some [[measurement error]] with a known [[upper bound]], the result of a measurement is well represented by a decimal with {{math|''n''}} digits after the decimal mark, as soon as the absolute measurement error is bounded from above by 10<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>. In practice, measurement results are often given with a certain number of digits after the decimal point, which indicate the error bounds. For example, although 0.080 and 0.08 denote the same decimal number, the numeral 0.080 suggests a measurement with an error less than 0.001, while the numeral 0.08 indicates an absolute error bounded by 0.01. In both cases, the true value of the measured quantity could be, for example, 0.0803 or 0.0796 (see also [[significant figures]]).\n\n==Infinite decimal expansion==\n{{main|Decimal representation}}\n\nFor a [[real number]] ''x'' and an integer ''n'' \u2265 0, let [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> denote the (finite) decimal expansion of the greatest number that is not greater than ''x'', which has exactly ''n'' digits after the decimal mark. Let ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> denote the last digit of [''x'']<sub>''i''</sub>. It is straightforward to see that [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> may be obtained by appending ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> to the right of [''x'']<sub>''n''\u20131</sub>. This way one has\n:[''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> = [''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''d''<sub>''n''</sub>,\n\nand the difference of [''x'']<sub>''n''\u20131</sub> and [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> amounts to \n:|[''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> \u2212 [''x'']<sub>''n''\u20131</sub>| = ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> \u22c5 10<sup>\u2212''n''</sup> < 10<sup>\u2212''n''+1</sup>,\n\nwhich is either 0, if ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0, or gets arbitrarily small, when ''n'' tends to infinity. According to the definition of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]], ''x'' is the limit of [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> when ''n'' tends to [[infinity]]. This is written as <math display=\"inline\">\\; x = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} [x]_n \\;</math> or\n: ''x'' = [''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>...,\nwhich is called an '''infinite decimal expansion''' of ''x''.\n\nConversely, for any integer [''x'']<sub>0</sub> and any sequence of digits <math display=\"inline\">\\;(d_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}</math> the (infinite) expression  {{nowrap|[''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>...}} is an ''infinite decimal expansion'' of a real number ''x''. This expansion is  unique if neither all ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 9 nor all ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 0 for ''n'' large enough (for all ''n'' greater than some natural number ''N'').\n\nIf all ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> for ''n'' > ''N'' equal to 9 and {{nowrap|[''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> {{=}} [''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>,}} the limit of the sequence <math display=\"inline\">\\;([x]_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}</math> is the decimal fraction obtained by replacing the last digit that is not a 9, i.e.: ''d''<sub>''N''</sub>, by ''d''<sub>''N''</sub> + 1, and replacing all subsequent 9s by 0s (see [[0.999...]]).\n\nAny such decimal fraction, i.e., ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0 for ''n'' > ''N'', may be converted to its equivalent infinite decimal expansion by replacing ''d''<sub>''N''</sub> by ''d''<sub>''N''</sub> \u2212 1, and replacing all subsequent 0s by 9s (see [[0.999...]]).\n\nIn summary, every real number that is not a decimal fraction has a unique infinite decimal expansion. Each decimal fraction has exactly two infinite decimal expansions, one containing only 0s after some place, which is obtained by the above definition of [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub>, and the other containing only 9s after some place, which is obtained by defining [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> as the greatest number that is ''less'' than ''x'', having exactly ''n'' digits after the decimal mark.\n\n=== Rational numbers ===\n{{main|Repeating decimal}}\n\n[[Long division]] allows computing the infinite decimal expansion of a [[rational number]]. If the rational number is a [[#decimal fraction|decimal fraction]], the division stops eventually, producing a decimal numeral, which may be prolongated into an infinite expansion by adding infinitely many zeros. If the rational number is not a decimal fraction, the division may continue indefinitely. However, as all successive remainders are less than the divisor, there are only a finite number of possible remainders, and after some place, the same sequence of digits must be repeated indefinitely in the quotient. That is, one has a ''repeating decimal''. For example,\n:{{sfrac|81}} = 0.&thinsp;012345679&thinsp;012... (with the group 012345679 indefinitely repeating).\n\nConversely, every eventually repeating sequence of digits is the infinite decimal expansion of a rational number. This is a consequence of the fact that the recurring part of a decimal representation is, in fact, an infinite [[geometric series]] which will sum to a rational number. For example,\n:<math>0.0123123123\\ldots =\\frac{123}{10000} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty 0.001^k = \\frac{123}{10000}\\ \\frac{1}{1-0.001} = \\frac{123}{9990} = \\frac{41}{3330}</math>\n\n== Decimal computation ==\n\n[[File:Decimal multiplication table.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of the world's earliest multiplication table ({{circa}} 305 BC) from the Warring States period]]\n\nMost modern [[computer]] hardware and software systems commonly use a [[Binary numeral system|binary representation]] internally (although many early computers, such as the [[ENIAC]] or the [[IBM 650]], used decimal representation internally).<ref>''Fingers or Fists? (The Choice of Decimal or Binary Representation)'', [[Werner Buchholz]], Communications of the ACM, Vol. 2 #12, pp3\u201311, ACM Press, December 1959.</ref>\nFor external use by computer specialists, this binary representation is sometimes presented in the related [[octal]] or [[hexadecimal]] systems.\n\nFor most purposes, however, binary values are converted to or from the equivalent decimal values for presentation to or input from humans; computer programs express literals in decimal by default. (123.1, for example, is written as such in a computer program, even though many computer languages are unable to encode that number precisely.)\n\nBoth computer hardware and software also use internal representations which are effectively decimal for storing decimal values and doing arithmetic. Often this arithmetic is done on data which are encoded using some variant of [[binary-coded decimal]],<ref name=\"Schmid_1983\">{{cite book |title=Decimal Computation |first=Hermann |author=Schmid<!-- General Electric Company, Binghamton, New York, USA --> |author-link=Hermann Schmid (computer scientist) |orig-year=1974 |date=1983 |edition=1 (reprint) |publisher=Robert E.

All numbers between 10 and 20 are formed regularly (e.g. 11 is expressed as \"tizenegy\" literally \"one on ten\"), as with those between 20 and 100 (23 as \"huszonh\u00e1rom\" = \"three on twenty\").\n\nA straightforward decimal rank system with a word for each order (10 {{lang|zh|\u5341}}, 100 {{lang|zh|\u767e}}, 1000 {{lang|zh|\u5343}}, 10,000 {{lang|zh|\u4e07}}), and in which 11 is expressed as ''ten-one'' and 23 as ''two-ten-three'', and 89,345 is expressed as 8 (ten thousands) {{lang|zh|\u4e07}} 9 (thousand) {{lang|zh|\u5343}} 3 (hundred) {{lang|zh|\u767e}} 4 (tens) {{lang|zh|\u5341}} 5 is found in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] with a few irregularities.  [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Thai language|Thai]] have imported the Chinese decimal system. Many other languages with a decimal system have special words for the numbers between 10 and 20, and decades. For example, in English 11 is  \"eleven\" not \"ten-one\" or \"one-teen\".\n\nIncan languages such as [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] have an almost straightforward decimal system, in which 11 is expressed as ''ten with one'' and 23 as ''two-ten with three''.\n\nSome psychologists suggest irregularities of the English names of numerals may hinder children's counting ability.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Azar| first=Beth| year=1999| title=English words may hinder math skills development| url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr99/english.html  |journal=American Psychology Association Monitor| volume=30| issue=4 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021015527/http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr99/english.html |archivedate = 2007-10-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Other bases ===\n{{main | positional notation }}\n{{Fundamental info units}}\nSome cultures do, or did, use other bases of numbers.\n* [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures such as the [[Maya numerals|Maya]] used a [[vigesimal|base-20]] system (perhaps based on using all twenty fingers and [[toe]]s).\n* The [[Yuki tribe|Yuki]] language in [[California]] and the Pamean languages<ref>{{Cite journal\n | last=Avelino\n | first=Heriberto\n | title=The typology of Pame number systems and the limits of Mesoamerica as a linguistic area\n | journal=Linguistic Typology\n | year=2006\n | volume=10\n | issue=1\n | pages=41\u201360\n | url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~avelino/Avelino_2006.pdf\n | doi=10.1515/LINGTY.2006.002\n }}</ref> in [[Mexico]] have [[octal|octal (base-8)]] systems because the speakers count using the spaces between their fingers rather than the fingers themselves.<ref>{{cite news|jstor=2686959|title=Ethnomathematics: A Multicultural View of Mathematical Ideas|author=Marcia Ascher|authorlink= Marcia Ascher |publisher=The College Mathematics Journal}}</ref>\n* The existence of a non-decimal base in the earliest traces of the Germanic languages is attested by the presence of words and glosses meaning that the count is in decimal (cognates to \"ten-count\" or \"tenty-wise\"); such would be expected if normal counting is not decimal, and unusual if it were.<ref>{{citation\n | last = McClean | first = R.

It is the extension to non-integer numbers of the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]].<ref>''The History of Arithmetic'', [[Louis Charles Karpinski]], 200pp, Rand McNally & Company, 1925.</ref> The way of denoting numbers in the decimal system is often referred to as ''decimal notation''.<ref>Lam Lay Yong & Ang Tian Se (2004) ''Fleeting Footsteps. Tracing the Conception of Arithmetic and Algebra in Ancient China'', Revised Edition, World Scientific, Singapore.</ref>\n\nA ''decimal numeral'', or just ''decimal'', or casually ''decimal number'', refers generally to the notation of a number in the decimal numeral system. Decimals may sometimes be identified for containing a [[decimal mark|decimal separator]] (for example the \".\" in {{math|10.00}} or {{math|3.14159}}). \"Decimal\" may also refer specifically to the digits after the decimal separator, such as in \"{{math|3.14}} is the approximation of {{pi}} to ''two decimals''\".\n\nThe numbers that may be represented in the decimal system are the [[#Decimal fractions|decimal fractions]], that is the [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] of the form {{math|''a''/10<sup>''n''</sup>}}, where {{math|''a''}} is an integer, and {{math|''n''}} is a [[non-negative integer]].\n\nThe decimal system has been extended to ''infinite decimals'', for representing any [[real number]], by using an [[sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequence]] of digits after the decimal separator (see [[Decimal representation]]). In this context, the decimal numerals with a finite number of non\u2013zero places after the decimal separator are sometimes called ''terminating decimals''. A [[repeating decimal]] is an infinite decimal that after some place repeats indefinitely the same sequence of digits (for example {{math|1=5.123144144144144... = 5.123{{overline|144}}}}).<ref>The [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum (overline)]] in 5.123<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">144</span> indicates that the '144' sequence repeats indefinitely, i.e. {{val|5.123144144144144|s=...}}.</ref> An infinite decimal represents a [[rational number]] if and only if it is a repeating decimal or has a finite number of nonzero digits.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Two hand, ten fingers.jpg|thumb|right|Ten fingers on two hands, the possible starting point of decimal counting.]]\nMany [[numeral system]]s of ancient civilizations use ten and its powers for representing numbers, possibly because there are ten fingers on two hands and people started counting by using their fingers. Examples are [[Brahmi numerals]], [[Greek numerals]], [[Hebrew numerals]], [[Roman numerals]], and [[Chinese numerals]]. Very large numbers were difficult to represent in these old numeral systems, and only the best mathematicians were able to multiply or divide large numbers. These difficulties were completely solved with the introduction of the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]] for representing [[integer]]s. This system has been extended to represent some non-integer numbers, called ''[[#Decimal fractions|decimal fractions]]'' or ''decimal numbers'' for forming the ''decimal numeral system''.\n\n== Decimal notation ==\nFor writing numbers, the decimal  system uses ten [[decimal digit]]s, a [[decimal mark]], and, for [[negative number]]s, a [[minus sign]] \"\u2212\". The decimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9;<ref>In some countries, such as [[Arab language|Arab speaking]] ones, other [[glyph]]s are used for the digits</ref> the decimal separator is the dot \"{{math|.}}\" in many countries (including all English speaking ones), but may be a comma \"{{math|,}}\" in other countries (mainly in [[continental Europe]]).\n\nFor representing a [[non-negative number]], a decimal consists of\n* either a (finite) sequence of digits such as 2017, or in full generality,\n::<math>a_ma_{m-1}\\ldots a_0</math>\n:(in this case, the (entire) decimal represents an integer)\n* or two sequence of digits separated by a decimal mark such as 3.14159, 15.00, or in full generality\n::<math>a_ma_{m-1}\\ldots a_0.b_1b_2\\ldots b_n</math>\nIt is generally assumed that, if {{math|''m'' > 0}}, the first digit {{math|''a''<sub>''m''</sub>}} is not zero, but, in some circumstances, it may be useful to have one or more 0's on the left. This does not change the value represented by the decimal. For example, {{math|1=3.14 = 03.14 = 003.14}}. Similarly, if {{math|1=''b''<sub>''n''</sub> =0}}, it may be removed, and conversely, trailing zeros may be added without changing the represented number: for example, {{math|1=15 = 15.0 = 15.00}} and {{math|1=5.2 = 5.20 = 5.200}}&nbsp;. Sometimes the extra zeros are used for indicating the accuracy of a measurement. For example, 15.00&nbsp;m may indicate that the measurement error is less than one centimeter (0.01&nbsp;m), while 15&nbsp;m may mean that the length is roughly fifteen meters, and that the error may exceed 10&nbsp;cm.\n\nFor representing a [[negative number]], a minus sign is placed before {{math|''a''<sub>''m''</sub>}}.\n\nThe numeral <math>a_ma_{m-1}\\ldots a_0.b_1b_2\\ldots b_n</math> represents the number\n:<math>a_m10^m+a_{m-1}10^{m-1}+\\cdots+a_{0}10^0+\\frac{b_1}{10^1}+\\frac{b_2}{10^2}+\\cdots+\\frac{b_n}{10^n}</math>\nTherefore, the contribution of each digit to the value of a number depends on its position in the numeral. That is, the decimal system is a [[positional numeral system]]\n\n== Decimal fractions ==\n\nThe numbers that are represented by decimal numerals are the '''decimal fractions''' (sometimes called '''decimal numbers'''), that is, the [[rational number]]s that may be expressed as a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]], the [[denominator]] of which is a [[exponentiation|power]] of ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Decimal_fraction|title=Decimal Fraction|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Mathematics]]|accessdate=2013-06-18}}</ref> For example, the numerals <math>0.8, 14.89, 0.00024</math> represent the fractions {{math|{{sfrac|8|10}}}}, {{math|{{sfrac|1489|100}}}}, {{math|{{sfrac|24|100000}}}}. More generally, a decimal with {{math|''n''}} digits after the separator represents the fraction with denominator {{math|10<sup>''n''</sup>}}, whose numerator is the integer obtained by removing the separator.\n\nExpressed as a [[fully reduced fraction]], the decimal numbers are those whose denominator is a product of a power of 2 and a power of 5. Thus the smallest denominators of decimal numbers are\n:<math>1=2^0\\cdot 5^0, 2=2^1\\cdot 5^0, 4=2^2\\cdot 5^0, 5=2^0\\cdot 5^1, 8=2^3\\cdot 5^0, 10=2^1\\cdot 5^1, 16=2^4\\cdot 5^0, 25=2^0\\cdot 5^2, \\ldots</math>\n\n<!-- The remainder of the section seems misplaced here -->The ''[[integer part]]'' or ''integral part'' of a decimal is the integer written to the left of the decimal separator (see also [[truncation]]). For a non-negative decimal, it is the largest integer that is not greater than the decimal. The part from the decimal separator to the right is the ''[[fractional part]]'', which equals the difference between the numeral and its integer part.\n\nWhen the integral part of a numeral is zero, it may occur, typically in [[computing]], that the integer part is not written (for example {{math|.1234}}, instead of {{math|0.1234}}). In normal writing, this is generally avoided because of the risk of confusion between the decimal mark and other punctuation.\n\n==Real number approximation==\n\nDecimal numerals do not allow an exact representation for all [[real number]]s, e.g. for the real number [[pi|{{pi}}]]. Nevertheless, they allow approximating every real number with any desired accuracy, e.g., the decimal 3.14159 approximates the real {{pi}}, being less than 10<sup>\u22125</sup> off; and so decimals are widely used in [[science]], [[engineering]] and everyday life.\n\nMore precisely, for every real number ''x'', and every positive integer ''n'', there are two decimals ''L'' and ''u'', with at most ''n'' digits after the decimal mark, such that ''L'' \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 ''u'' and (''u'' \u2013 ''L'') = 10<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>.\n\nNumbers are very often obtained as the result of a [[measurement]]. As measurements are generally afflicted with some [[measurement error]] with a known [[upper bound]], the result of a measurement is well represented by a decimal with {{math|''n''}} digits after the decimal mark, as soon as the absolute measurement error is bounded from above by 10<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>. In practice, measurement results are often given with a certain number of digits after the decimal point, which indicate the error bounds. For example, although 0.080 and 0.08 denote the same decimal number, the numeral 0.080 suggests a measurement with an error less than 0.001, while the numeral 0.08 indicates an absolute error bounded by 0.01. In both cases, the true value of the measured quantity could be, for example, 0.0803 or 0.0796 (see also [[significant figures]]).\n\n==Infinite decimal expansion==\n{{main|Decimal representation}}\n\nFor a [[real number]] ''x'' and an integer ''n'' \u2265 0, let [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> denote the (finite) decimal expansion of the greatest number that is not greater than ''x'', which has exactly ''n'' digits after the decimal mark. Let ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> denote the last digit of [''x'']<sub>''i''</sub>. It is straightforward to see that [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> may be obtained by appending ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> to the right of [''x'']<sub>''n''\u20131</sub>. This way one has\n:[''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> = [''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''d''<sub>''n''</sub>,\n\nand the difference of [''x'']<sub>''n''\u20131</sub> and [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> amounts to \n:|[''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> \u2212 [''x'']<sub>''n''\u20131</sub>| = ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> \u22c5 10<sup>\u2212''n''</sup> < 10<sup>\u2212''n''+1</sup>,\n\nwhich is either 0, if ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0, or gets arbitrarily small, when ''n'' tends to infinity. According to the definition of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]], ''x'' is the limit of [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> when ''n'' tends to [[infinity]]. This is written as <math display=\"inline\">\\; x = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} [x]_n \\;</math> or\n: ''x'' = [''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>...,\nwhich is called an '''infinite decimal expansion''' of ''x''.\n\nConversely, for any integer [''x'']<sub>0</sub> and any sequence of digits <math display=\"inline\">\\;(d_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}</math> the (infinite) expression  {{nowrap|[''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>...}} is an ''infinite decimal expansion'' of a real number ''x''. This expansion is  unique if neither all ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 9 nor all ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 0 for ''n'' large enough (for all ''n'' greater than some natural number ''N'').\n\nIf all ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> for ''n'' > ''N'' equal to 9 and {{nowrap|[''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> {{=}} [''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>,}} the limit of the sequence <math display=\"inline\">\\;([x]_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}</math> is the decimal fraction obtained by replacing the last digit that is not a 9, i.e.: ''d''<sub>''N''</sub>, by ''d''<sub>''N''</sub> + 1, and replacing all subsequent 9s by 0s (see [[0.999...]]).\n\nAny such decimal fraction, i.e., ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0 for ''n'' > ''N'', may be converted to its equivalent infinite decimal expansion by replacing ''d''<sub>''N''</sub> by ''d''<sub>''N''</sub> \u2212 1, and replacing all subsequent 0s by 9s (see [[0.999...]]).\n\nIn summary, every real number that is not a decimal fraction has a unique infinite decimal expansion. Each decimal fraction has exactly two infinite decimal expansions, one containing only 0s after some place, which is obtained by the above definition of [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub>, and the other containing only 9s after some place, which is obtained by defining [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> as the greatest number that is ''less'' than ''x'', having exactly ''n'' digits after the decimal mark.\n\n=== Rational numbers ===\n{{main|Repeating decimal}}\n\n[[Long division]] allows computing the infinite decimal expansion of a [[rational number]]. If the rational number is a [[#decimal fraction|decimal fraction]], the division stops eventually, producing a decimal numeral, which may be prolongated into an infinite expansion by adding infinitely many zeros. If the rational number is not a decimal fraction, the division may continue indefinitely. However, as all successive remainders are less than the divisor, there are only a finite number of possible remainders, and after some place, the same sequence of digits must be repeated indefinitely in the quotient. That is, one has a ''repeating decimal''. For example,\n:{{sfrac|81}} = 0.&thinsp;012345679&thinsp;012... (with the group 012345679 indefinitely repeating).\n\nConversely, every eventually repeating sequence of digits is the infinite decimal expansion of a rational number. This is a consequence of the fact that the recurring part of a decimal representation is, in fact, an infinite [[geometric series]] which will sum to a rational number. For example,\n:<math>0.0123123123\\ldots =\\frac{123}{10000} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty 0.001^k = \\frac{123}{10000}\\ \\frac{1}{1-0.001} = \\frac{123}{9990} = \\frac{41}{3330}</math>\n\n== Decimal computation ==\n\n[[File:Decimal multiplication table.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of the world's earliest multiplication table ({{circa}} 305 BC) from the Warring States period]]\n\nMost modern [[computer]] hardware and software systems commonly use a [[Binary numeral system|binary representation]] internally (although many early computers, such as the [[ENIAC]] or the [[IBM 650]], used decimal representation internally).<ref>''Fingers or Fists? (The Choice of Decimal or Binary Representation)'', [[Werner Buchholz]], Communications of the ACM, Vol. 2 #12, pp3\u201311, ACM Press, December 1959.</ref>\nFor external use by computer specialists, this binary representation is sometimes presented in the related [[octal]] or [[hexadecimal]] systems.\n\nFor most purposes, however, binary values are converted to or from the equivalent decimal values for presentation to or input from humans; computer programs express literals in decimal by default. (123.1, for example, is written as such in a computer program, even though many computer languages are unable to encode that number precisely.)\n\nBoth computer hardware and software also use internal representations which are effectively decimal for storing decimal values and doing arithmetic. Often this arithmetic is done on data which are encoded using some variant of [[binary-coded decimal]],<ref name=\"Schmid_1983\">{{cite book |title=Decimal Computation |first=Hermann |author=Schmid<!-- General Electric Company, Binghamton, New York, USA --> |author-link=Hermann Schmid (computer scientist) |orig-year=1974 |date=1983 |edition=1 (reprint) |publisher=Robert E.

Several Indian languages show a straightforward decimal system. Many [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] and [[Dravidian languages]] have numbers between 10 and 20 expressed in a regular pattern of addition to 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html|title=Indian numerals|work=Ancient Indian mathematics|accessdate=2015-05-22}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hungarian language]] also uses a straightforward decimal system. All numbers between 10 and 20 are formed regularly (e.g. 11 is expressed as \"tizenegy\" literally \"one on ten\"), as with those between 20 and 100 (23 as \"huszonh\u00e1rom\" = \"three on twenty\").\n\nA straightforward decimal rank system with a word for each order (10 {{lang|zh|\u5341}}, 100 {{lang|zh|\u767e}}, 1000 {{lang|zh|\u5343}}, 10,000 {{lang|zh|\u4e07}}), and in which 11 is expressed as ''ten-one'' and 23 as ''two-ten-three'', and 89,345 is expressed as 8 (ten thousands) {{lang|zh|\u4e07}} 9 (thousand) {{lang|zh|\u5343}} 3 (hundred) {{lang|zh|\u767e}} 4 (tens) {{lang|zh|\u5341}} 5 is found in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] with a few irregularities.  [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Thai language|Thai]] have imported the Chinese decimal system. Many other languages with a decimal system have special words for the numbers between 10 and 20, and decades. For example, in English 11 is  \"eleven\" not \"ten-one\" or \"one-teen\".\n\nIncan languages such as [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] have an almost straightforward decimal system, in which 11 is expressed as ''ten with one'' and 23 as ''two-ten with three''.\n\nSome psychologists suggest irregularities of the English names of numerals may hinder children's counting ability.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Azar| first=Beth| year=1999| title=English words may hinder math skills development| url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr99/english.html  |journal=American Psychology Association Monitor| volume=30| issue=4 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021015527/http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr99/english.html |archivedate = 2007-10-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Other bases ===\n{{main | positional notation }}\n{{Fundamental info units}}\nSome cultures do, or did, use other bases of numbers.\n* [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures such as the [[Maya numerals|Maya]] used a [[vigesimal|base-20]] system (perhaps based on using all twenty fingers and [[toe]]s).\n* The [[Yuki tribe|Yuki]] language in [[California]] and the Pamean languages<ref>{{Cite journal\n | last=Avelino\n | first=Heriberto\n | title=The typology of Pame number systems and the limits of Mesoamerica as a linguistic area\n | journal=Linguistic Typology\n | year=2006\n | volume=10\n | issue=1\n | pages=41\u201360\n | url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~avelino/Avelino_2006.pdf\n | doi=10.1515/LINGTY.2006.002\n }}</ref> in [[Mexico]] have [[octal|octal (base-8)]] systems because the speakers count using the spaces between their fingers rather than the fingers themselves.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2686959|title=Ethnomathematics: A Multicultural View of Mathematical Ideas|author=Marcia Ascher|authorlink= Marcia Ascher |publisher=The College Mathematics Journal}}</ref>\n* The existence of a non-decimal base in the earliest traces of the Germanic languages is attested by the presence of words and glosses meaning that the count is in decimal (cognates to \"ten-count\" or \"tenty-wise\"); such would be expected if normal counting is not decimal, and unusual if it were.<ref>{{citation\n | last = McClean | first = R.

The 27th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the film is based on the classic [[Charles Dickens]] novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', which has been adapted many other times for the screen. In the film, Oliver is a homeless kitten who joins a gang of dogs to survive in the streets. Among other changes, the setting of the film was relocated from 19th century [[London]] to modern-day [[New York City]], Fagin's gang is made up of dogs (one of which is Dodger), and Sykes is a [[loan shark]].\n\nFollowing the release of ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'', [[Michael Eisner]] and [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] held a pitch meeting with the animation staff, in which story artist Pete Young pitched the idea to adapt ''Oliver Twist'' with dogs. The pitch was quickly approved, and the film quickly went into production under the working title ''Oliver and the Dodger''. Released on the same day as ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', ''Oliver & Company'' was a box office success, but it received mixed reviews from film critics. The film was re-released in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom on March 29, 1996. It was then released on home video later that same year, and again in 2002 and 2009 on DVD. The film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] in 2013, commemorating its 25th Anniversary.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words in length. -->\nOn [[Fifth Avenue]], an orphaned kitten named Oliver is left abandoned after his fellow orphaned kittens are adopted by passersby. Wandering the streets by himself in search of someone to adopt him, Oliver meets a laid-back [[mongrel]] named Dodger who assists the kitten in stealing food from a [[hot dog]] vendor. Dodger then flees the scene without sharing his bounty with Oliver. Oliver follows Dodger all throughout the streets until they eventually arrive at a [[barge]], where Dodger shares his meal with a gang of fellow strays: Tito the [[Chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]], Einstein the [[Great Dane]], Rita the [[Saluki]], and Francis the [[bulldog]]. Oliver sneaks inside and is discovered by the dogs. After a moment of confusion, he is received with a warm welcome. The barge's owner, a [[pickpocket]] named Fagin, is indebted to Sykes, a nefarious shipyard agent and [[loan shark]] accompanied by his [[Doberman]]s Roscoe and DeSoto. Sykes gives Fagin an ultimatum of repaying the money he had borrowed within three days under the threat of imminent violence.\n\nFagin and the gang, now including Oliver, hit the streets the next morning to carry out petty theft so that Fagin may pawn the stolen goods for money. Through a theatrical ruse, the dogs manage to stop a luxurious limousine owned by the wealthy Foxworth family. The attempt to pillage the limousine fails and Oliver finds himself in the embrace of the Foxworth daughter Jenny, who adopts Oliver to assuage the loneliness brought about by the absence of her vacationing parents. Oliver makes himself at home in Jenny's house, much to the disgust of Georgette, the Foxworth family's pompous and pampered purebred [[poodle]]. Dodger and the others manage to steal Oliver from the Foxworth household and return him to the barge. Fagin recognizes from Oliver's new collar that he had been adopted by a wealthy family and desperately decides to hold Oliver for ransom. His anonymously written ransom note reaches Jenny, who sets out to get Oliver back at the pier.\n\nJenny meets with Fagin, who is shocked that he had been dealing with a little girl. Bothered by his conscience after seeing Jenny distraught over losing Oliver, Fagin gives Oliver back freely. Sykes, whom Fagin had informed of the deal beforehand and was watching from the shadows, drives by and kidnaps Jenny, intending to ransom her and declaring Fagin's debt paid. Dodger rallies Oliver and the other dogs to rescue Jenny from Sykes, but the animals are confronted by Sykes and his Dobermans after they free her. Fagin saves the group with his scooter and a chase ensues throughout the streets and into the subway tunnels. Oliver and Dodger attempt a rescue and struggle with Roscoe and DeSoto, who fall off the car and are electrocuted on the subway's [[third rail]]. Sykes is killed when his car drives straight into the path of an oncoming train. Later, Jenny celebrates her birthday with the animals, Fagin and the family butler Winston, who receives a phone call from Jenny's parents saying that they will be returning from [[Rome]] the next day. Oliver opts to stay with Jenny, but he promises to remain in contact with Dodger and the gang.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<!-- Before you edit, please note that Sykes was not referred to as Bill Sykes in the film, only as Sykes. -->\n* [[Joey Lawrence]] as [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver]]: an orange orphaned kitten who is looking for a home. He joins Fagin's gang of dogs before being taken in by Jenny.\n* [[Billy Joel]] as [[Artful Dodger|Dodger]], a carefree, charismatic [[mongrel]] with a mix of [[terrier]] in him. He claims to have considerable \"street savoir-faire.\" He is the leader of Fagin's gang of dogs, and is Oliver's first acquaintance, as well as his eventual best friend and bodyguard.\n* [[Cheech Marin]] as Tito, a tiny yet passionate [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] in Fagin's gang. He has a fiery temper for his size, and rapidly develops a crush on Georgette (although she is initially repulsed by him). His full name is Ignacio Alonso Julio Federico de Tito.\n* [[Richard Mulligan]] as Einstein, a gray [[Great Dane]] and a member of Fagin's gang. He is named ironically as he is not particularly bright, representing the stereotype that Great Danes are friendly but dim-witted.\n* [[Roscoe Lee Browne]] as Francis, a [[bulldog]] with a [[British English|British]] accent in Fagin's gang. He appreciates art and theatre, particularly [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. He also detests anyone abbreviating his name as \"Frank\" or \"Frankie\" (which Tito frequently does). Originally, [[Patrick Stewart]] was considered to voice Francis, but he was busy acting as Captain Jean-Luc Picard on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.\n* [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]] ([[Ruth Pointer]], singing) as [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Rita]], a [[Saluki]]<ref name=\"WashingtonPost\" /> and the only female dog in Fagin's gang. She is street-wise and takes Oliver under her wing.\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as [[Fagin]], a lowly thief who lives on a barge with his dogs. He desperately needs money to repay his debt with Sykes. Because of his economic situation, he is forced to perform criminal acts such as pick-pocketing and petty theft, but in truth he is well-meaning and genial most of the time.\n* [[Taurean Blacque]] and [[Carl Weintraub]] as Roscoe and DeSoto, respectively: Sykes's vicious [[Doberman Pinscher]]s who have a hostile history with Dodger and his friends. Roscoe is the apparent leader, while his brother DeSoto seems to be the more savage of the two.\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as [[Bill Sikes|Sykes]], a cold-hearted, immoral loan shark and shipyard agent who lent a considerable sum of money to Fagin and expects it paid back. Originally [[Marlon Brando]] was offered the role of Sykes by the head of the Walt Disney Company Michael Eisner himself. Brando, however, turned it down, fearing the movie would bomb.\n* [[Natalie Gregory]] (Myhanh Tran, singing) as [[Mr. Brownlow|Jennifer \"Jenny\" Foxworth]], a kind-hearted, rich girl who adopts Oliver.\n* William Glover as Winston, the Foxworth family's bumbling but loyal butler.\n* [[Bette Midler]] as Georgette, the Foxworth family's prize-winning poodle. Vain and spoiled, she becomes jealous of Oliver but eventually accepts him and Fagin's gang.\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Old Louie, an aggressive, bad-tempered hot dog vendor who appears early in the film when Oliver and Dodger steal his hot dogs. He is described by Dodger as \"a well-known enemy of the four-legged world,\" meaning that he hates both cats and dogs.\n\n==Production==\n''Oliver & Company'' was the twenty-seventh [[animation|animated]] film developed by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]], and the first one to begin production under the supervision of Chief Executive Officer [[Michael Eisner]] and Chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]]; the duo, who had previously worked at [[Paramount Pictures]] as chairman and head of production, respectively, joined the company in 1984.<ref name=\"disneytwist\">{{cite news|title='Oliver & Company' Gives Dickens A Disney Twist urban scene from an appropriate rooftop.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE4D81F3CF930A25752C1A96E948260|first=John|last=Culhane|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 13, 1988|access-date=July 10, 2015}}</ref> After the release of ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' in 1985, Eisner and Katzenberg invited the animators to pitch potential ideas for upcoming animated features, infamously called the \"Gong Show.\" After [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]] suggested ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[Treasure Planet|Treasure Island in Space]]'', story artist Pete Young suggested, \"''Oliver Twist'' with dogs.\" Katzenberg, who had previously planned on producing a live-action adaptation of the musical ''[[Oliver!]]'' at Paramount,<ref name=\"disneytwist\"/> approved the pitch.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pp=93\u201394}} Under the working title of ''Oliver and the Dodger'',{{sfn|Beck|2005|pp=182-83}}<ref>{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Willistein|title=Disney Gearing Up For More Animation|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1987-11-22/entertainment/2601792_1_animation-disney-characters-disney-theme-parks|work=[[The Morning Call]]|date=November 22, 1987|access-date=July 10, 2015}}</ref> the film was originally much darker and grittier with the film opening with Sykes's two [[Doberman]]s murdering Oliver's parents, setting the story to focus on Oliver exacting his revenge as detailed in a draft dated on March 30, 1987.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=192}} [[George Scribner]] and [[Richard Rich (director)|Richard Rich]] were announced as the directors of the project, while Pete Young was appointed as story supervisor,{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=90}} though Rich was fired from Disney about six months into production, leaving Scribner as the sole director.<ref>{{cite interview|subject=George Scribner|title=Once Upon A Time In New York City: Oliver & Company's Director George Scribner!|interviewer=J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Noyer|url=http://animatedviews.com/2009/once-upon-a-time-in-new-york-city-oliver-companys-director-george-scribner/|publisher=Animated Views|date=February 3, 2009|access-date=July 10, 2015}}</ref> In this adaptation, Scribner turned Oliver into a na\u00efve kitten, Dodger and the gang into dogs, and Fagin into a human with Jenny Foxworth inspired by the characters of [[Mr. Brownlow]] (Oliver's adoptive father) and Penny from ''[[The Rescuers]]'', and encouraged the film to be more street smart.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=192}} Furthermore, Scribner borrowed a technique from ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' by [[blocking (stage)|blocking out]] the scenes on real streets, and then photographing them with cameras mounted eighteen inches off the ground.

However, the writers would have problems with the idea,{{sfn|Beck|2005|pp=182-83}} and the panda sub-plot was eventually dropped when Scribner suggested to have Fagin hold Oliver for ransom because he was a valuable, rare [[Asian cat]].{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=193}}{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=96}}\n\nFor the film, Disney invested $15 million into a long-term computer system called [[Computer Animation Production System]], otherwise known as CAPS. Unlike ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' and ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'', which used computer imagery for special sequences, eleven minutes of ''Oliver & Company'' were computer-generated such as the skyscrapers, the taxi cabs, trains, Fagin's scooter-cart, and the climactic subway chase.<ref name=\"disneytwist\"/> Meanwhile, the traditional animation was handled by the next generation of Disney animators, including supervising animators [[Glen Keane]], [[Ruben A.

Because energy proved to be the key to Tito's personality, Marin claimed \"I was encouraged to ad-lib, but I'd say I just gave about 75% of the lines as they were written.

The 27th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the film is based on the classic [[Charles Dickens]] novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', which has been adapted many other times for the screen. In the film, Oliver is a homeless kitten who joins a gang of dogs to survive in the streets. Among other changes, the setting of the film was relocated from 19th century [[London]] to modern-day [[New York City]], Fagin's gang is made up of dogs (one of which is Dodger), and Sykes is a [[loan shark]].\n\nFollowing the release of ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'', [[Michael Eisner]] and [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] held a pitch meeting with the animation staff, in which story artist Pete Young pitched the idea to adapt ''Oliver Twist'' with dogs. The pitch was quickly approved, and the film quickly went into production under the working title ''Oliver and the Dodger''. Released on the same day as ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', ''Oliver & Company'' was a box office success, but it received mixed reviews from film critics. The film was re-released in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom on March 29, 1996. It was then released on home video later that same year, and again in 2002 and 2009 on DVD. The film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] in 2013, commemorating its 25th Anniversary.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words in length. -->\nOn [[Fifth Avenue]], an orphaned kitten named Oliver is left abandoned after his fellow orphaned kittens are adopted by passersby. Wandering the streets by himself in search of someone to adopt him, Oliver meets a laid-back [[mongrel]] named Dodger who assists the kitten in stealing food from a [[hot dog]] vendor. Dodger then flees the scene without sharing his bounty with Oliver. Oliver follows Dodger all throughout the streets until they eventually arrive at a [[barge]], where Dodger shares his meal with a gang of fellow strays: Tito the [[Chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]], Einstein the [[Great Dane]], Rita the [[Saluki]], and Francis the [[bulldog]]. Oliver sneaks inside and is discovered by the dogs. After a moment of confusion, he is received with a warm welcome. The barge's owner, a [[pickpocket]] named Fagin, is indebted to Sykes, a nefarious shipyard agent and [[loan shark]] accompanied by his [[Doberman]]s Roscoe and DeSoto. Sykes gives Fagin an ultimatum of repaying the money he had borrowed within three days under the threat of imminent violence.\n\nFagin and the gang, now including Oliver, hit the streets the next morning to carry out petty theft so that Fagin may pawn the stolen goods for money. Through a theatrical ruse, the dogs manage to stop a luxurious limousine owned by the wealthy Foxworth family. The attempt to pillage the limousine fails and Oliver finds himself in the embrace of the Foxworth daughter Jenny, who adopts Oliver to assuage the loneliness brought about by the absence of her vacationing parents. Oliver makes himself at home in Jenny's house, much to the disgust of Georgette, the Foxworth family's pompous and pampered purebred [[poodle]]. Dodger and the others manage to steal Oliver from the Foxworth household and return him to the barge. Fagin recognizes from Oliver's new collar that he had been adopted by a wealthy family and desperately decides to hold Oliver for ransom. His anonymously written ransom note reaches Jenny, who sets out to get Oliver back at the pier.\n\nJenny meets with Fagin, who is shocked that he had been dealing with a little girl. Bothered by his conscience after seeing Jenny distraught over losing Oliver, Fagin gives Oliver back freely. Sykes, whom Fagin had informed of the deal beforehand and was watching from the shadows, drives by and kidnaps Jenny, intending to ransom her and declaring Fagin's debt paid. Dodger rallies Oliver and the other dogs to rescue Jenny from Sykes, but the animals are confronted by Sykes and his Dobermans after they free her. Fagin saves the group with his scooter and a chase ensues throughout the streets and into the subway tunnels. Oliver and Dodger attempt a rescue and struggle with Roscoe and DeSoto, who fall off the car and are electrocuted on the subway's [[third rail]]. Sykes is killed when his car drives straight into the path of an oncoming train. Later, Jenny celebrates her birthday with the animals, Fagin and the family butler Winston, who receives a phone call from Jenny's parents saying that they will be returning from [[Rome]] the next day. Oliver opts to stay with Jenny, but he promises to remain in contact with Dodger and the gang.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<!-- Before you edit, please note that Sykes was not referred to as Bill Sykes in the film, only as Sykes. -->\n* [[Joey Lawrence]] as [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver]]: an orange orphaned kitten who is looking for a home. He joins Fagin's gang of dogs before being taken in by Jenny.\n* [[Billy Joel]] as [[Artful Dodger|Dodger]], a carefree, charismatic [[mongrel]] with a mix of [[terrier]] in him. He claims to have considerable \"street savoir-faire.\" He is the leader of Fagin's gang of dogs, and is Oliver's first acquaintance, as well as his eventual best friend and bodyguard.\n* [[Cheech Marin]] as Tito, a tiny yet passionate [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] in Fagin's gang. He has a fiery temper for his size, and rapidly develops a crush on Georgette (although she is initially repulsed by him). His full name is Ignacio Alonso Julio Federico de Tito.\n* [[Richard Mulligan]] as Einstein, a gray [[Great Dane]] and a member of Fagin's gang. He is named ironically as he is not particularly bright, representing the stereotype that Great Danes are friendly but dim-witted.\n* [[Roscoe Lee Browne]] as Francis, a [[bulldog]] with a [[British English|British]] accent in Fagin's gang. He appreciates art and theatre, particularly [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. He also detests anyone abbreviating his name as \"Frank\" or \"Frankie\" (which Tito frequently does). Originally, [[Patrick Stewart]] was considered to voice Francis, but he was busy acting as Captain Jean-Luc Picard on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.\n* [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]] ([[Ruth Pointer]], singing) as [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Rita]], a [[Saluki]]<ref name=\"WashingtonPost\" /> and the only female dog in Fagin's gang. She is street-wise and takes Oliver under her wing.\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as [[Fagin]], a lowly thief who lives on a barge with his dogs. He desperately needs money to repay his debt with Sykes. Because of his economic situation, he is forced to perform criminal acts such as pick-pocketing and petty theft, but in truth he is well-meaning and genial most of the time.\n* [[Taurean Blacque]] and [[Carl Weintraub]] as Roscoe and DeSoto, respectively: Sykes's vicious [[Doberman Pinscher]]s who have a hostile history with Dodger and his friends. Roscoe is the apparent leader, while his brother DeSoto seems to be the more savage of the two.\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as [[Bill Sikes|Sykes]], a cold-hearted, immoral loan shark and shipyard agent who lent a considerable sum of money to Fagin and expects it paid back. Originally [[Marlon Brando]] was offered the role of Sykes by the head of the Walt Disney Company Michael Eisner himself.

While she and her siblings are on an outing with their father in his four-flippered submarine, Brunhilde sneaks off and floats away on the back of a [[jellyfish]]. After an encounter with a [[fishing trawler]], she becomes trapped in a glass jar and drifts to the shore of a small fishing town where she is rescued by a five-year-old boy named S\u014dsuke. Shattering the jar with a rock, S\u014dsuke cuts his finger in the process. Brunhilde licks his wound causing it to heal almost instantly. S\u014dsuke names her Ponyo and promises to protect her. Meanwhile, a distraught Fujimoto searches frantically for his lost daughter whom he believes to have been kidnapped. He calls his wave spirits to recover her, leaving S\u014dsuke heartbroken and confused by what happened.\n\nPonyo and Fujimoto have an argument, during which Ponyo refuses to let her father call her by her birth name. She declares her desire to be known as 'Ponyo' and to become human. Using her magic, she forces herself to grow leg- and arm-like appendages and start changing into a human, a power granted to her by the human blood she ingested when she licked S\u014dsuke's finger. Her alarmed father forces her to change back into her true form and leaves to summon Ponyo's mother, Gran Mamare. Meanwhile, Ponyo, with the help of her sisters, breaks away from her father and inadvertently uses his magic to make herself fully human. The huge amount of magic that she releases into the ocean causes an imbalance in the world, resulting in a [[tsunami]], leaving ships stranded at sea. Ponyo goes back to S\u014dsuke, who is amazed and overjoyed to see her. He tells his mother, Lisa, that Ponyo has returned as a little girl. Lisa allows Ponyo to stay at their house for the time being, and they wait out the storm together at S\u014dsuke's house. Worried about the residents of the nursing home where she works, Lisa leaves to check up on them, promising S\u014dsuke that she will return home as soon as possible.\n\nGran Mamare arrives at Fujimoto's [[submarine]]. S\u014dsuke's father, K\u014dichi, sees her traveling and recognizes her as the [[Guanyin|Goddess of Mercy]]. Fujimoto notices the moon appears to be falling out of its orbit and [[satellite]]s are falling like shooting stars, symptoms of the dangerous imbalance of nature that now exists. Gran Mamare declares that if S\u014dsuke can pass a test, Ponyo can live as a human and that the order of the world will be restored. A still-worried Fujimoto reminds her that if S\u014dsuke fails the test, Ponyo will turn into sea foam.\n\nS\u014dsuke and Ponyo wake up to find that most of the land around the house has been covered by the ocean. Since it is impossible for Lisa to come home, the two children decide to find her. With the help of Ponyo's [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]], they make S\u014dsuke's toy [[pop pop boat]] life-size and set out across the swollen ocean.\n\nWhen Ponyo and S\u014dsuke make it to the forest, however, Ponyo tires and falls asleep only to be woken by S\u014dsuke, who implores her to ignite a second candle as the one powering their boat is about to go out. Ponyo then dozes off multiple times before concentrating enough to make the candle, which then goes out. She then passes out, and S\u014dsuke has to push the boat to shore, only to find that the boat, deprived of Ponyo's magic, is reverting to its toy size. S\u014dsuke drags Ponyo to the shore, where he finds Lisa's abandoned car. Ponyo then wakes up, and the two decide to continue looking for her.\n\nPonyo and S\u014dsuke head into a tunnel. Inside Ponyo reverts to being a fish due to overuse of her magical powers. Meanwhile, Lisa and the residents of the nursing home, who are temporarily able to breathe water because of Gran Mamare, are waiting excitedly below the surface for Ponyo and S\u014dsuke to arrive. S\u014dsuke and Ponyo encounter Fujimoto, who warns the boy that the balance of nature is in danger and begs Sosuke to return Ponyo to him. S\u014dsuke doubts Fujimoto and attempts to flee, but the two children are quickly captured and Fujimoto takes them down to the protected nursing home.\n\nS\u014dsuke is reunited with Lisa and meets Gran Mamare, with whom Lisa has just had a long private conversation. Gran Mamare asks S\u014dsuke if he can love Ponyo whether she is a fish or human. S\u014dsuke replies that he \"loves all the Ponyos.\" Gran Mamare then tells her daughter that if she chooses to become human once and for all, she will have to give up her magical powers. Ponyo agrees to this, so Gran Mamare encases her in a bubble and gives her to S\u014dsuke. She tells him that kissing the bubble will complete Ponyo's transformation. The balance of nature is thus restored and the previously stranded ships head back to port. Fujimoto respects his daughter's choice to become a human, having decided he can trust S\u014dsuke. Ponyo then joyfully jumps high in the air and kisses S\u014dsuke, completing her transformation as a human.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character name\n!

While she and her siblings are on an outing with their father in his four-flippered submarine, Brunhilde sneaks off and floats away on the back of a [[jellyfish]]. After an encounter with a [[fishing trawler]], she becomes trapped in a glass jar and drifts to the shore of a small fishing town where she is rescued by a five-year-old boy named S\u014dsuke. Shattering the jar with a rock, S\u014dsuke cuts his finger in the process. Brunhilde licks his wound causing it to heal almost instantly. S\u014dsuke names her Ponyo and promises to protect her. Meanwhile, a distraught Fujimoto searches frantically for his lost daughter whom he believes to have been kidnapped. He calls his wave spirits to recover her, leaving S\u014dsuke heartbroken and confused by what happened.\n\nPonyo and Fujimoto have an argument, during which Ponyo refuses to let her father call her by her birth name. She declares her desire to be known as 'Ponyo' and to become human. Using her magic, she forces herself to grow leg- and arm-like appendages and start changing into a human, a power granted to her by the human blood she ingested when she licked S\u014dsuke's finger. Her alarmed father forces her to change back into her true form and leaves to summon Ponyo's mother, Gran Mamare. Meanwhile, Ponyo, with the help of her sisters, breaks away from her father and inadvertently uses his magic to make herself fully human. The huge amount of magic that she releases into the ocean causes an imbalance in the world, resulting in a [[tsunami]], leaving ships stranded at sea. Ponyo goes back to S\u014dsuke, who is amazed and overjoyed to see her. He tells his mother, Lisa, that Ponyo has returned as a little girl. Lisa allows Ponyo to stay at their house for the time being, and they wait out the storm together at S\u014dsuke's house. Worried about the residents of the nursing home where she works, Lisa leaves to check up on them, promising S\u014dsuke that she will return home as soon as possible.\n\nGran Mamare arrives at Fujimoto's [[submarine]]. S\u014dsuke's father, K\u014dichi, sees her traveling and recognizes her as the [[Guanyin|Goddess of Mercy]]. Fujimoto notices the moon appears to be falling out of its orbit and [[satellite]]s are falling like shooting stars, symptoms of the dangerous imbalance of nature that now exists. Gran Mamare declares that if S\u014dsuke can pass a test, Ponyo can live as a human and that the order of the world will be restored. A still-worried Fujimoto reminds her that if S\u014dsuke fails the test, Ponyo will turn into sea foam.\n\nS\u014dsuke and Ponyo wake up to find that most of the land around the house has been covered by the ocean. Since it is impossible for Lisa to come home, the two children decide to find her. With the help of Ponyo's [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]], they make S\u014dsuke's toy [[pop pop boat]] life-size and set out across the swollen ocean.\n\nWhen Ponyo and S\u014dsuke make it to the forest, however, Ponyo tires and falls asleep only to be woken by S\u014dsuke, who implores her to ignite a second candle as the one powering their boat is about to go out. Ponyo then dozes off multiple times before concentrating enough to make the candle, which then goes out. She then passes out, and S\u014dsuke has to push the boat to shore, only to find that the boat, deprived of Ponyo's magic, is reverting to its toy size. S\u014dsuke drags Ponyo to the shore, where he finds Lisa's abandoned car. Ponyo then wakes up, and the two decide to continue looking for her.\n\nPonyo and S\u014dsuke head into a tunnel. Inside Ponyo reverts to being a fish due to overuse of her magical powers. Meanwhile, Lisa and the residents of the nursing home, who are temporarily able to breathe water because of Gran Mamare, are waiting excitedly below the surface for Ponyo and S\u014dsuke to arrive. S\u014dsuke and Ponyo encounter Fujimoto, who warns the boy that the balance of nature is in danger and begs Sosuke to return Ponyo to him. S\u014dsuke doubts Fujimoto and attempts to flee, but the two children are quickly captured and Fujimoto takes them down to the protected nursing home.\n\nS\u014dsuke is reunited with Lisa and meets Gran Mamare, with whom Lisa has just had a long private conversation. Gran Mamare asks S\u014dsuke if he can love Ponyo whether she is a fish or human. S\u014dsuke replies that he \"loves all the Ponyos.\" Gran Mamare then tells her daughter that if she chooses to become human once and for all, she will have to give up her magical powers. Ponyo agrees to this, so Gran Mamare encases her in a bubble and gives her to S\u014dsuke. She tells him that kissing the bubble will complete Ponyo's transformation. The balance of nature is thus restored and the previously stranded ships head back to port. Fujimoto respects his daughter's choice to become a human, having decided he can trust S\u014dsuke. Ponyo then joyfully jumps high in the air and kisses S\u014dsuke, completing her transformation as a human.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character name\n!

A [[Conservatism in Canada|Conservative]], he became prime minister upon the resignation of Prime Minister [[Mackenzie Bowell|Sir Mackenzie Bowell]] over the [[Manitoba Schools Question]] in 1896.  Tupper was the shortest-serving prime minister, with a term of only 68 days.  He led his party in two general elections (1896, 1900) and lost both, to [[wilfrid Laurier|Sir Wilfrid Laurier]]\n\nPrior to [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, Tupper was active in Nova Scotia politics, and was [[Premier of Nova Scotia]] from 1864 to 1867, when he was elected to the first [[House of Commons of Canada]].\n\n==Summary==\n[[File:Canada provinces 1889-1895.png|thumb|right|Canada had seven provinces, one territory and one semi-autonomous district during Tupper's term as Prime Minister.]]\n\nTupper had the [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada by time in office|shortest term in office of all twenty-three prime ministers]], serving for just 68 days in the spring of 1896.<ref>[https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/primeMinisters PARLINFO:  Prime Ministers of Canada.]</ref>\n\nTupper was the second of three prime ministers from Nova Scotia, the others being [[John Sparrow David Thompson|Sir John Sparrow David Thompson]] and [[Robert L. Borden|Sir Robert Laird Borden]].\n\nHe became prime minister upon the resignation of [[Mackenzie Bowell|Sir Mackenzie Bowell]], who resigned after a Cabinet revolt over his handling of the [[Manitoba Schools Question]].  Tupper never sat in the Commons as prime minister, being sworn in as prime minister after the Commons was dissolved and the 1896 election called. He was defeated in the [[1896 Canadian federal election|1896 election]] by [[Wilfrid Laurier]].  Tupper maintained the leadership of the Conservative Party and ran again in the [[1900 Canadian federal election|general election of 1900]].  He was again defeated, including losing his own seat of [[Cape Breton (electoral district)|Cape Breton]].  He then retired, the last of the [[Fathers of Confederation]] to leave politics.\n\nTupper stood for election to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] twelve times, nine times  for the constituency of [[Cumberland (electoral district)|Cumberland]], Nova Scotia (1867, 1870, 1872, 1874, 1878 (twice), 1882, and 1887 (twice)), and three times for the constituency of [[Cape Breton (electoral district)|Cape Breton]] (1896 (twice), 1900). He was elected eleven times, including four times by acclamation (two [[ministerial by-elections]] (1870, 1878), one general election (1882), and one case where a sitting Member of Parliament resigned his seat to allow Tupper to re-enter the Commons (1896)). He lost at the constituency level only once, in his final election of 1900.  He served a total of 22 years, 7 months, 17 days in the Commons.<ref name = Tupper>[https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/Profile?personId=6179 PARLINFO:   TUPPER, The Right Hon.

Prior to the election, he had effectively led the government in the House of Commons on the [[Manitoba Schools Question]], since Prime Minister Bowell was in the Senate and had suffered a Cabinet revolt on his handling of the issue.  His main opponent in the general election was [[Wilfrid Laurier]], the leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]].

Tupper never sat in the Commons as prime minister, being sworn in as prime minister after the Commons was dissolved and the 1896 election called. He was defeated in the [[1896 Canadian federal election|1896 election]] by [[Wilfrid Laurier]].  Tupper maintained the leadership of the Conservative Party and ran again in the [[1900 Canadian federal election|general election of 1900]].

He was elected eleven times, including four times by acclamation (two [[ministerial by-elections]] (1870, 1878), one general election (1882), and one case where a sitting Member of Parliament resigned his seat to allow Tupper to re-enter the Commons (1896)).

He was a world champion in two [[weight class (boxing)|weight classes]], having held the [[WBA (Regular)]] [[super lightweight]] title from 2011 to 2012, and the WBA [[welterweight]] title from 2013 to 2014. A versatile [[pressure fighter|brawler]] in the ring, Maidana was well known for his formidable punching power, and was never [[technical knockout|stopped]] in any of his five losses. He famously outbrawled and withstood punishing blows from Floyd Mayweather, Jr. during their first bout, but lost to Mayweather via majority decision.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Light welterweight===\nMaidana started his career in 2004 before turning 21 years old. He fought his first 18 fights in his native Argentina over two years, winning all, including 17 via stoppage. On his 18th bout, he won the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Fedelatin [[Light welterweight|super lightweight]] title. Over the next year, Maidana only fought once in Argentina, five times in Germany and once in Panama. At the end of 2008, Maidana had a professional record of 25-0, with 24 stoppages.\n\n====Maidana vs. Kotelnik====\nOn 2 February 2009, Maidana challenged for his first world title, the WBA super lightweight championship against [[Andreas Kotelnik]] at the StadtHalle in [[Rostock]], Germany. Kotelnik beat Maidana via controversial [[split decision]], with the judges scoring the fight 115\u2013114, 113\u2013115, and 115\u2013113 in Kotelnik's favor.<ref>{{Citation|last=\u041c\u0438\u0440 \u0411\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0430 (The world of Boxing)|title=Marcos Maidana vs Andriy Kotelnik (07 02 2009)|date=2015-05-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hulDzkLrEM|accessdate=2018-02-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2009/02/kotelnik-defeats-maidana-in-a-war/|title=Kotelnik Defeats Maidana In a War \u00bb Boxing News|date=2009-02-08|work=Boxing News 24|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Maidana was credited with landing 342 of 1241 punches thrown (28%), with 259 of them being power punches and Kotelnik was more accurate in landing 229 of his 655 thrown (35%).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/compubox-punch-stats-khan-kotelnik-maidana-kotelnik--33744|title=CompuBox Punch Stats: Khan-Kotelnik, Maidana-Kotelnik|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\n====Maidana vs. Ortiz====\nMaidana's first fight in the [[United States]] was against [[Victor Ort\u00edz]], that took place on June 27, 2009 for the [[Interim championship|Interim]] [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] super lightweight title.

He landed multiple power punches, including an uppercut that opened a huge swelling over Morales' left eye which worsened over the course of the fight, and when the Mexican walked back to his corner having taken a large amount of punishment in the opening three minutes most observers felt their predictions were being fulfilled. The one-sided nature of the bout continued for the next couple of rounds, but then at the end of the third round Morales begin to fight back and landed a hard combination to the head of Maidana and the tide began to turn. From the fourth round onwards and although he was effectively fighting with one eye, Morales gave as good as he got and was landing the cleaner more effective shots, albeit occasionally being swarmed by the sheer number of punches being landed in return by the relentless Maidana. The fight became a see-saw affair and then, in the eighth round, Morales hit Maidana with a huge left hook that almost stopped the Argentine. The next couple of rounds continued in this fashion, with Maidana using his strength and stamina to bully Morales and the Mexican using his sharper punching and ring intelligence to land effective counters and combinations. The fight was fast turning into a modern classic. In the championship rounds, Morales seemed to tire and Maidana took advantage, overwhelming him with his strength and punishing the ageing warrior continually to the head and body. Maidana finished the fight much the stronger of the two and his late surge gave him the win on the scorecards, 116\u2013112 twice with the third judge scoring the fight a draw, 114\u2013114.

I think this is a great fight for me and he deserves the opportunity to see if he can do what 45 others have tried to do before him \u2013 beat me.\" Maidana was a 12-to-1 underdog going into the fight.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/10513894/floyd-mayweather-jr-lines-marcos-maidana-next-fight|title=Mayweather lines up Maidana for next fight|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-08-29}}</ref>\n\nIn front of a sold-out crowd of 16,268, in what was one of his toughest fights, Mayweather won the bout via [[majority decision]], with scores of 114\u2013114, 117\u2013111, and 116\u2013112.

Unlike the first fight, Mayweather came out better prepared for Maidana's style. The final judges' scores were 115\u2013112, 116\u2013111, and 116\u2013111. ESPN scored it wider for Mayweather at 119\u2013108. Despite a moment at the end of round 3 where Maidana rocked Floyd, Mayweather did not allow Maidana to land any overhand right, with the punch stats showing Maidana connecting 128 of 572 shots (22%). Mayweather had 51% connect rate landing 166 of 326.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2197732-mayweather-vs-maidana-2-live-round-by-round-results-and-highlights|title=Mayweather vs. Maidana 2: Live Round-by-Round Results and Highlights|author=Chen, Brian|date=2014-09-13|publisher=[[Bleacher Report]]|accessdate=2016-12-27}}</ref>\n\nA bizarre moment occurred in round 8, whilst in a headlock, Maidana appeared to have bitten Mayweather's left hand. Mayweather explained this in the post fight, \"I didn't know what it was. Something happened and then my fingers were numb. After the eighth round my fingers were numb. I could only use my other hand. He bit me. I realized he bit me. We were tangled in the middle of the ring and all of a sudden I felt something on my left hand.\" Maidana denied the bite, \"Maybe he thinks I'm a dog, but I never bit him. He was rubbing my eyes that round. He may have had his glove in my mouth, but I never bit him.\" After round 9, Maidana appeared to be confused as he started walking towards the wrong corner. Mayweather immediately ran towards him to point to his corner, much to the amusement of the crowd. Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, \"If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can give it to him. I was attacking all the time. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that I was the aggressor. I kept my plan to be aggressive but he kept holding and pushing. I don't want to waste my time with a third fight. I trained with all my heart to get this type of result. This is not fair. There's not reason for another fight.\" For the sequel, Mayweather earned a minimum of $32 million and Maidana earned a career high $3 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/11522417/floyd-mayweather-jr-scores-unanimous-decision-marcos-maidana-rematch|title=Mayweather decisions Maidana in rematch|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2014/9/14/6146209/mayweather-vs-maidana-results-floyd-mayweather-wins-easier-decision|title=Mayweather wins easier in rematch with Maidana|work=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2017-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2014/9/14/6146479/mayweather-vs-maidana-2-results-floyd-mayweather-wins-rematch-by|title=Mayweather takes decision win over Maidana|last=Brookhouse|first=Brent|date=2014-09-14|website=SBNation.com|access-date=2017-08-29}}</ref>\n\nThe fight did well on PPV, a reported 925,000 households bought the fight, generating $60 million.

He was a world champion in two [[weight class (boxing)|weight classes]], having held the [[WBA (Regular)]] [[super lightweight]] title from 2011 to 2012, and the WBA [[welterweight]] title from 2013 to 2014. A versatile [[pressure fighter|brawler]] in the ring, Maidana was well known for his formidable punching power, and was never [[technical knockout|stopped]] in any of his five losses. He famously outbrawled and withstood punishing blows from Floyd Mayweather, Jr. during their first bout, but lost to Mayweather via majority decision.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Light welterweight===\nMaidana started his career in 2004 before turning 21 years old. He fought his first 18 fights in his native Argentina over two years, winning all, including 17 via stoppage. On his 18th bout, he won the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Fedelatin [[Light welterweight|super lightweight]] title. Over the next year, Maidana only fought once in Argentina, five times in Germany and once in Panama. At the end of 2008, Maidana had a professional record of 25-0, with 24 stoppages.\n\n====Maidana vs. Kotelnik====\nOn 2 February 2009, Maidana challenged for his first world title, the WBA super lightweight championship against [[Andreas Kotelnik]] at the StadtHalle in [[Rostock]], Germany. Kotelnik beat Maidana via controversial [[split decision]], with the judges scoring the fight 115\u2013114, 113\u2013115, and 115\u2013113 in Kotelnik's favor.<ref>{{Citation|last=\u041c\u0438\u0440 \u0411\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0430 (The world of Boxing)|title=Marcos Maidana vs Andriy Kotelnik (07 02 2009)|date=2015-05-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hulDzkLrEM|accessdate=2018-02-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2009/02/kotelnik-defeats-maidana-in-a-war/|title=Kotelnik Defeats Maidana In a War \u00bb Boxing News|date=2009-02-08|work=Boxing News 24|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Maidana was credited with landing 342 of 1241 punches thrown (28%), with 259 of them being power punches and Kotelnik was more accurate in landing 229 of his 655 thrown (35%).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/compubox-punch-stats-khan-kotelnik-maidana-kotelnik--33744|title=CompuBox Punch Stats: Khan-Kotelnik, Maidana-Kotelnik|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\n====Maidana vs. Ortiz====\nMaidana's first fight in the [[United States]] was against [[Victor Ort\u00edz]], that took place on June 27, 2009 for the [[Interim championship|Interim]] [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] super lightweight title.

He landed multiple power punches, including an uppercut that opened a huge swelling over Morales' left eye which worsened over the course of the fight, and when the Mexican walked back to his corner having taken a large amount of punishment in the opening three minutes most observers felt their predictions were being fulfilled. The one-sided nature of the bout continued for the next couple of rounds, but then at the end of the third round Morales begin to fight back and landed a hard combination to the head of Maidana and the tide began to turn. From the fourth round onwards and although he was effectively fighting with one eye, Morales gave as good as he got and was landing the cleaner more effective shots, albeit occasionally being swarmed by the sheer number of punches being landed in return by the relentless Maidana. The fight became a see-saw affair and then, in the eighth round, Morales hit Maidana with a huge left hook that almost stopped the Argentine. The next couple of rounds continued in this fashion, with Maidana using his strength and stamina to bully Morales and the Mexican using his sharper punching and ring intelligence to land effective counters and combinations. The fight was fast turning into a modern classic. In the championship rounds, Morales seemed to tire and Maidana took advantage, overwhelming him with his strength and punishing the ageing warrior continually to the head and body. Maidana finished the fight much the stronger of the two and his late surge gave him the win on the scorecards, 116\u2013112 twice with the third judge scoring the fight a draw, 114\u2013114. Most of the 7,154 fans in attendance booed the decision.
