Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of [[bison]].\n\nKansas was first settled by [[Americans]] in 1827 with the establishment of [[Fort Leavenworth]]. The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s, in the midst of political wars over the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] debate. When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], abolitionist [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] from [[New England]] and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring [[Missouri]] rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a [[Slave states and free states|free state or a slave state]]. Thus, the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided, and was known as [[Bleeding Kansas]].

The first European to set foot in present-day Kansas was the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado]], who explored the area in 1541. In 1803, most of modern Kansas was [[United States territorial acquisitions|acquired by the United States]] as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Southwest Kansas, however, was still a part of Spain, Mexico, and the [[Republic of Texas]] until the conclusion of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1848, when these lands were [[Mexican Cession|ceded to the United States]]. From 1812 to 1821, Kansas was part of the [[Missouri Territory]]. The [[Santa Fe Trail]] traversed Kansas from 1821 to 1880, transporting manufactured goods from [[Missouri]] and silver and furs from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. Wagon ruts from the trail are still visible in the prairie today.\n\nIn 1827, [[Fort Leavenworth]] became the first permanent settlement of white Americans in the future state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a211662.pdf|title=A Brief History of Fort Leavenworth|author=Partin, John W. Partin|year=1983|access-date=January 24, 2019}}</ref> The [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] became law on May 30, 1854, establishing [[Nebraska Territory]] and [[Kansas Territory]], and opening the area to broader settlement by whites. [[Kansas Territory]] stretched all the way to the Continental Divide and included the sites of present-day [[Denver]], [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]].\n[[File:Battle of Lawrence.png|thumb|[[Lawrence Massacre|Quantrill's Raid]] on [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]]]]\n\nMissouri and [[Arkansas]] sent settlers into Kansas all along its eastern border. These settlers attempted to sway votes in favor of slavery. The secondary settlement of Americans in Kansas Territory were [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] from [[Massachusetts]] and other [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]], who attempted to stop the spread of slavery from neighboring Missouri. Directly presaging the [[American Civil War]], these forces collided, entering into skirmishes that earned the territory the name of [[Bleeding Kansas]].\n\nKansas was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] as a free state on January 29, 1861, making it the 34th state to join the United States. By that time, the violence in Kansas had largely subsided, but during the Civil War, on August 21, 1863, [[William Quantrill]] led several hundred men on a raid into [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], destroying much of the city and killing nearly 200 people. He was roundly condemned by both the conventional [[Confederate States Army|Confederate military]] and the partisan rangers commissioned by the [[Missouri legislature]]. His application to that body for a commission was flatly rejected due to his pre-war criminal record.<ref>Jones, ''Gray Ghosts and Rebel Riders'' Holt & Co. 1956, p. 76</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, many veterans constructed homesteads in Kansas. Many [[African Americans]] also looked to Kansas as the land of \"[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]\" and, led by [[freedmen]] like [[Benjamin \"Pap\" Singleton]], began establishing black colonies in the state. Leaving southern states in the late 1870s because of increasing discrimination, they became known as [[Exodusters]].\n\nAt the same time, the [[Chisholm Trail]] was opened and the [[American Old West|Wild West]]-era commenced in Kansas. [[Wild Bill Hickok]] was a deputy marshal at [[Fort Riley]] and a marshal at [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]] and [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]]. [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]] was another wild cowboy town, and both [[Bat Masterson]] and [[Wyatt Earp]] worked as lawmen in the town. In one year alone, eight million head of cattle from Texas boarded trains in Dodge City bound for the East, earning Dodge the nickname \"Queen of the Cowtowns\".\n\nIn response to demands of Methodists and other evangelical Protestants, in 1881 Kansas became the first U.S. state to adopt a constitutional amendment [[Prohibition|prohibiting]] all [[Alcohol laws of Kansas|alcoholic beverages]], which was repealed in 1948.\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:Great Plains LCC (14285769265).jpg|thumb|The [[Great Plains]] of Kansas]]\n[[File:Kanopolissp.JPG|thumb|[[Kanopolis State Park]]]]\n[[File:Wabaunsee County View.JPG|thumb|[[Flint Hills]] in Wabaunsee County]]\n\nKansas is bordered by [[Nebraska]] on the north; [[Missouri]] on the east; [[Oklahoma]] on the south; and [[Colorado]] on the west.

A sequence of [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]], [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] and [[Permian]] rocks outcrop in the eastern and southern part of the state. The state's western half has exposures of [[Cretaceous]] through Tertiary sediments, the latter derived from the [[erosion]] of the [[Tectonic uplift|uplifted]] [[Rocky Mountains]] to the west. These are underlain by older Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments which correlate well with the outcrops to the east. The state's northeastern corner was subjected to [[glaciation]] in the [[Pleistocene]] and is covered by [[glacial drift]] and [[loess]].\n\n===Topography===\n\nThe western two-thirds of the state, lying in the [[Great Plains|great central plain]] of the United States, has a generally flat or undulating surface, while the eastern third has many hills and forests.

The eastern two-thirds of the state (especially the northeastern portion) has a [[humid continental climate]], with cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Most of the precipitation falls during both the summer and the spring.\n\nThe western third of the state\u2014from roughly the [[U.S. Route 83]] corridor westward\u2014has a [[semi-arid climate|semiarid]] [[steppe]] climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters are highly changeable between warm and very cold. The western region receives an average of about {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}} of precipitation per year. [[Chinook wind]]s in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=off}} range.\n\nThe far south-central and southeastern portions of the state, including the [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] area, have a [[humid subtropical climate]] with hot and humid summers, milder winters, and more precipitation than elsewhere in Kansas. Some features of all three climates can be found in most of the state, with droughts and changeable weather between dry and humid not uncommon, and both warm and cold spells in the winter.\n\nTemperatures in areas between U.S. Routes 83 and [[U.S. Route 81|81]], as well as the southwestern portion of the state along and south of [[U.S. Route 50|U.S. 50]], reach {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=}} or above on most days of June, July, and August. High humidity added to the high temperatures sends the [[heat index]] into life-threatening territory, especially in Wichita, [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]], [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], [[Russell, Kansas|Russell]], [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]], and [[Great Bend, Kansas|Great Bend]]. Temperatures are often higher in [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]], [[Garden City, Kansas|Garden City]], and [[Liberal, Kansas|Liberal]], but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature.\n\nAlthough temperatures of {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} or higher are not as common in areas east of U.S. 81, higher humidity and the [[urban heat island]] effect lead most summer days to heat indices between {{convert|107|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and {{convert|114|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], and the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]]. During the summer, nightly low temperatures in the northeastern part of the state, especially in the aforementioned large cities, struggle to fall below {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Also, combined with humidity between 85 and 95 percent, dangerous heat indices can be experienced at every hour of the day.\n\nPrecipitation ranges from about {{convert|47|in|mm}} annually in the state's southeast corner to about {{convert|16|in|mm}} in the southwest. Snowfall ranges from around {{convert|5|in|mm}} in the fringes of the south, to {{convert|35|in|mm}} in the far northwest. Frost-free days range from more than 200 days in the south, to 130 days in the northwest. Thus, Kansas is the country's ninth or tenth sunniest state, depending on the source. Western Kansas is as sunny as parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].\n\nKansas is prone to severe weather, especially in the spring and the early-summer. Despite the frequent sunshine throughout much of the state, due to its location at a climatic boundary prone to intrusions of multiple air masses, the state is vulnerable to strong and severe thunderstorms. Some of these storms become [[supercell]] thunderstorms; these can produce some [[tornado]]es, occasionally those of [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF3]] strength or higher. Kansas averages more than 50 tornadoes annually.<ref name=\"Annual Average Number of Tornadoes\">{{cite web |title = Annual Average Number of Tornadoes, 1953\u20132004 |url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] |accessdate = October 25, 2006 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archivedate = October 16, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Severe thunderstorms sometimes drop some very large [[hail]] over Kansas as well. Furthermore, these storms can even bring in flash flooding and damaging straight line winds.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the all-time highest temperature recorded in Kansas is ({{convert|121|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}) on July 24, 1936, near [[Alton, Kansas|Alton]] in [[Osborne County, Kansas|Osborne County]], and the all-time low is {{convert|-40|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} on February 13, 1905, near [[Lebanon, Kansas|Lebanon]] in [[Smith County, Kansas|Smith County]]. Alton and Lebanon are approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}} apart.\n\nKansas's record high of {{convert|121|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|sigfig=3}} ties with [[North Dakota]] for the fifth-highest record high in an American state, behind California ({{convert|134|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), [[Arizona]] ({{convert|128|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), [[Nevada]] ({{convert|125|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), and [[New Mexico]] ({{convert|122|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or}}).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly Normal High and Low Temperatures For Various Kansas Cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n!

Production has experienced a steady, natural decline as it becomes increasingly difficult to extract oil over time. Since [[Price of oil|oil prices]] bottomed in 1999, oil production in Kansas has remained fairly constant, with an average monthly rate of about {{convert|2.8|Moilbbl|m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} in 2004. The [[Oil price increases since 2003|recent higher prices]] have made [[carbon dioxide]] sequestration and other oil recovery techniques more economical.\n\nKansas is also ranked eighth in US natural gas production. Production has steadily declined since the mid-1990s with the gradual depletion of the [[Hugoton Natural Gas Area|Hugoton Natural Gas Field]]\u2014the state's largest field which extends into Oklahoma and Texas. In 2004, slower declines in the Hugoton gas fields and increased [[coalbed methane]] production contributed to a smaller overall decline. Average monthly production was over {{convert|32|e9cuft|km3|abbr=off|sp=us}}.\n\nThe state's economy is also heavily influenced by the aerospace industry. Several large aircraft corporations have manufacturing facilities in Wichita and Kansas City, including [[Spirit AeroSystems]], [[Bombardier Aerospace]] ([[LearJet]]), and [[Textron Aviation]] (a merger of the former [[Cessna]], [[Hawker Aircraft|Hawker]], and [[Beechcraft]] brands). [[Boeing]] ended a decades-long history of manufacturing in Kansas between 2012 and 2013.\n\nMajor companies headquartered in Kansas include the [[Sprint Corporation]] (with world headquarters in [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]]), [[YRC Worldwide]] (Overland Park), [[Garmin]] ([[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]]), [[Payless Shoes]] (national headquarters and major distribution facilities in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]]), and [[Koch Industries]] (with national headquarters in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]), and [[Coleman Company|Coleman]] (headquarters in Wichita) . Telephone company [[Embarq]] formerly had its national headquarters in [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]] before its acquisition by [[CenturyTel]] in 2009, and still employs several hundred people in [[Gardner, Kansas|Gardner]].\n\nKansas is also home to three major military installations: [[Fort Leavenworth]] (Army), [[Fort Riley]] (Army), and [[McConnell Air Force Base]] (Air Force). Approximately 25,000 active duty soldiers and airmen are stationed at these bases which also employ approximately 8,000 civilian DoD employees. The US Army Reserve also has the 451st Expeditionary Sustainment Command headquartered in Wichita that serves reservists and their units from around the region. The Kansas Air National Guard has units at [[Forbes Field]] in Topeka and the 184th Intelligence Wing in Wichita. The Smoky Hill Weapons Range, a detachment of the Intelligence Wing, is one of the largest and busiest bombing ranges in the nation. During WWII, Kansas was home to numerous Army Air Corps training fields for training new pilots and aircrew. Many of those airfields live on today as municipal airports.\n\n===Taxes===\n\nTax is collected by the [[Kansas Department of Revenue]].\n\nRevenue shortfalls resulting from lower than expected tax collections and slower growth in personal income following a 1998 permanent tax reduction have contributed to the substantial growth in the state's debt level as bonded debt increased from $1.16&nbsp;billion in 1998 to $3.83&nbsp;billion in 2006. Some increase in debt was expected as the state continues with its 10-year Comprehensive Transportation Program enacted in 1999.\n\nIn 2003, Kansas had three income brackets for income tax calculation, ranging from 3.5% to 6.45%.\n\nThe state sales tax in Kansas is 6.15%. Various cities and counties in Kansas have an additional local sales tax. Except during the 2001 [[recession]] (March\u2013November 2001), when monthly sales tax collections were flat, collections have trended higher as the economy has grown and two rate increases have been enacted. If there had been no change in sales tax rates or in the economy, the total sales tax collections for 2003 would have been $1,797&nbsp;million, compared to $805.3&nbsp;million in 1990. However, they instead amounted to $1,630&nbsp;million an inflation-adjusted reduction of 10%. The state sales tax is a combined destination-based tax, meaning a single tax is applied that includes state, county, and local taxes, and the rate is based on where the consumer takes possession of the goods or services. Thanks to the destination structure and the numerous local special taxing districts, Kansas has 920 separate sales tax rates ranging from 6.5% to 11.5%.<ref>{{cite web |title = Publication 1700 |url = https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |website = Kansas Department of Revenue |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405025326/https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |archivedate = April 5, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> This taxing scheme, known as \"[[Streamlined Sales Tax]]\" was adopted on October 1, 2005, under the governorship of [[Kathleen Sebelius]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Streamlined Sales Tax\u2014Kansas |url = http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |website = Streamlined Sales Tax |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405090353/http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |archivedate = April 5, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Groceries are subject to sales tax in the state. All sales tax collected is remitted to the state department of revenue, and local taxes are then distributed to the various taxing agencies.\n\nAs of June 2004, [[Moody's Investors Service]] ranked the state 14th for net tax-supported debt per capita. As a percentage of personal income, it was at 3.8%\u2014above the median value of 2.5% for all rated states and having risen from a value of less than 1% in 1992. The state has a statutory requirement to maintain cash reserves of at least 7.5% of expenses at the end of each fiscal year; however, lawmakers can vote to override the rule, and did so during the most recent budget agreement.\n\n{{Main|Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117}}\n\nDuring his campaign for the 2010 election, Governor [[Sam Brownback]] called for a complete \"phase out of Kansas's income tax\".<ref name=\"theatlantic_tax_experiment_dead_2017\"/> In May 2012, Governor Brownback signed into law the '''Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117'''.<ref name=\"HB2117\">{{cite web |title = Senate Substitute for HB 2117 by Committee on Taxation\u2014Reduction of income tax rates for individuals and determination of income tax credits; severance tax exemptions; homestead property tax refunds; food sales tax refunds |url = http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/measures/hb2117/ |accessdate = October 29, 2014 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141030002120/http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/measures/hb2117/ |archivedate = October 30, 2014 |df = mdy-all}}</ref> Starting in 2013, the \"ambitious tax overhaul\" trimmed income tax, eliminated some corporate taxes, and created [[Flow-through entity|pass-through income]] tax exemptions, he raised the sales tax by one percent to offset the loss to state revenues but that was inadequate.

Mixing fact and fiction, the book chronicles the events and aftermath of the 1959 murder of a wealthy farmer and his family who lived in the small West Kansas town of [[Holcomb, Kansas|Holcomb]] in [[Finney County]].\n\nThe fictional town of [[Smallville]], Kansas is the childhood home of Clark Kent/[[Superman]] in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]].\n\nThe winner of the 2011 [[Newbery Medal]] for excellence in children's literature, ''[[Moon Over Manifest]]'', tells the story of a young and adventurous girl named Abilene who is sent to the fictional town of Manifest, Kansas, by her father in the summer of 1936.

Most theaters at the time showed films only as part of [[vaudeville]] acts but not as an exclusive and stand alone form of entertainment. Though the [[Patee family]] had been involved in [[vaudeville]], they believed films could carry the evening without other variety acts, but in order to show the films it was necessary for the Patee's to establish a generating plant (back in 1903 Lawrence was not yet fully electrified). The Patee Theater was one of the first of its kind west of the [[Mississippi River]].

However, Topeka was unable to support the team, and it disbanded after one year.\n\nThe first night game in the history of professional baseball was played in Independence on April 28, 1930 when the Muscogee (Oklahoma) Indians beat the Independence Producers 13\u20133 in a minor league game sanctioned by the Western League of the Western Baseball Association with 1,500 fans attending the game.

The teams are rivals in the [[Big 12 Conference]].\n\nBoth KU and K-State have tradition-rich programs in men's basketball. The Jayhawks are a perennial national power, ranking second in all-time victories among NCAA programs, behind [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]]. The Jayhawks have won five national titles, including NCAA tournament championships in 1952, 1988, and 2008. They also were retroactively awarded national championships by the [[Helms Foundation]] for 1922 and 1923. K-State also had a long stretch of success on the hardwood, lasting from the 1940s to the 1980s, making four [[Final Four]]s during that stretch. In 1988, KU and K-State met in the [[Elite Eight]], KU taking the game 71\u201358. After a 12-year absence, the Wildcats returned to the NCAA tournament in 2008, and advanced to the Elite Eight in 2010 and 2018. KU is fifth all-time with 15 Final Four appearances, while K-State's four appearances are tied for 17th.\n\nConversely, success on the [[American football|gridiron]] has been less frequent for both KSU and KU. However, there have been recent breakthroughs for both schools' football teams. The Jayhawks won the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] for the first time in three tries in 2008, capping a 12\u20131 season, the best in school history. And when [[Bill Snyder]] arrived to coach at K-State in 1989, he turned the Wildcats from one of the worst college football programs in America,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Looney |first=Douglas |title=Futility U |journal=Sports Illustrated |date=September 4, 1989 |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/09/04/120464/futility-u-kansas-state-winless-since-1986-has-one-claim-to-fame-it-is-americas-most-hapless-team}}</ref> into a national force for most of the 1990s and early 2000s. The team won the [[Fiesta Bowl]] in 1997, achieved an undefeated (11\u20130) regular season and No.{{nbsp}}1 ranking in 1998, and took the [[Big 12 Conference]] championship in 2003. After three seasons in which K-State football languished, Snyder came out of retirement in 2009 and guided them to the top of the college football ranks again, finishing second in the Big 12 in 2011 and earning a berth in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]], and winning the Big 12 again in 2012.\n\n[[Wichita State University]], which also fields teams (called the [[Wichita State Shockers|Shockers]]) in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], is best known for its baseball and basketball programs. In baseball, the Shockers won the [[College World Series]] in 1989. In men's basketball, they appeared in the Final Four in 1965 and 2013, and entered the 2014 NCAA tournament unbeaten. The school also fielded a [[American football|football]] team from 1897 to 1986. The Shocker football team is tragically known for a [[Wichita State University football team plane crash|plane crash]] in 1970 that killed 31 people, including 14 players.\n\n=====NCAA Division II schools=====\n\nNotable success has also been achieved by the state's smaller schools in football. [[Pittsburg State University]], an NCAA Division II participant, has claimed four national titles in football, two in the NAIA and most recently the 2011 NCAA Division II national title. Pittsburg State became the winningest NCAA Division II football program in 1995. PSU passed Hillsdale College at the top of the all-time victories list in the 1995 season on its march to the national runner-up finish. The Gorillas, in 96 seasons of intercollegiate competition, have accumulated 579 victories, posting a 579\u2013301\u201348 overall mark.\n\n[[Washburn University]], in Topeka, won the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] Men's Basketball Championship in 1987. The [[Fort Hays State University]] men won the 1996 NCAA Division II title with a 34\u20130 record, and the Washburn women won the 2005 NCAA Division II crown. St. Benedict's College (now Benedictine College), in Atchison, won the 1954 and 1967 Men's NAIA Basketball Championships.\n\nThe [[Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference]] has its roots as one of the oldest college sport conferences in existence and participates in the NAIA and all ten member schools are in the state of Kansas. Other smaller school conferences that have some members in Kansas are the [[Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association]] the [[Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference]], the [[Midwest Christian College Conference]], and the [[Heart of America Athletic Conference]]. Many [[junior college]]s also have active athletic programs.\n\n[[Emporia State]]'s women's basketball team, under head coach [[Brandon Schneider]], who is now serving as the women's basketball coach at the University of Kansas, has seen success as well. In 2010 the team won the NCAA Division II National Championship. Emporia State and Washburn in Topeka share a heated rivalry in all sports, mostly due to the close proximity of both cities.\n\n=====Junior Colleges=====\n\nThe [[Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference]] has been heralded as one of the best conferences in all of [[NJCAA]] football, with [[Garden City Community College]], [[Independence Community College]], and [[Butler County Community College]] all consistently in contention for national championships.\n\n====High school====\n\nThe [[Kansas State High School Activities Association]] (KSHSAA) is the organization which oversees interscholastic competition in the state of Kansas at the high school level. It oversees both athletic and non-athletic competition, and sponsors championships in several sports and activities. The association is perhaps best known for devising the overtime system now used for almost all football games below the professional level (which has also been adopted at all levels of [[Canadian football]]).\n\n==Notable people==\n\n{{Main|List of people from Kansas}}\n\n==Landmarks==\n\n{{Main|List of Kansas landmarks}}\n{{See also|National Register of Historic Places listings in Kansas}}\n\n==See also==\n\n{{portal|Kansas|United States}}\n* [[Index of Kansas-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Kansas]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n<!--Note: the section name \"Bibliography\" is linked from other articles, posted in April 2018 by User:Sbmeirow-->\n{{See also|History of Kansas#Bibliography|l1=Longer list of books about the history of Kansas}}\n* {{Cite book |last1=Mechem |first1=Kirke |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1911 to 1925 |date=1956 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |isbn= |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/212250/ }}; 559 pages.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Mechem |first1=Kirke |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1886 to 1910 |date=1954 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |isbn= |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/212249/ }}; 535 pages.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Wilder |first1=Daniel W. |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1541 to 1885 |date=1886 |publisher=Kansas Publishing House |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/223666}}; 1204 pages.\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Connelley |editor-first=William E. |title=A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans |publisher=Lewis Publishing Company |year=1918 |url=http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1918ks/toc.html }}; 5 volumes; 2731 pages; ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo00conn/ Vol1]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo02conn/ Vol2]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo03conn/ Vol3]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo04conn/ Vol4]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo05conn/ Vol5]); the 1919 edition contains additional biographies.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Connelley |first1=William E. |title=History of Kansas Newspapers: A History of the Newspapers and Magazines Published in Kansas from 1854 to 1916 |date=1916 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/211020/ }}; 369 pages.\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Blackmar |editor-first=Frank W. |title=Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Embracing Events, Institutions, Industries, Counties, Cities, Towns, Prominent Persons, Etc |publisher = Standard Publishing Co |year=1912 |url=http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1912/ }}; 3 volumes; 2723 pages; ([https://archive.org/details/kansascyc01blac/ Vol1]), ([https://archive.org/details/kansascycloped02blac/ Vol2]), ([https://archive.org/details/kansascyclopedia03blac/ Vol3])\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Everts |editor-first=Louis H. |title=Official State Atlas of Kansas |publisher=L.H.

Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of [[bison]].\n\nKansas was first settled by [[Americans]] in 1827 with the establishment of [[Fort Leavenworth]]. The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s, in the midst of political wars over the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] debate. When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], abolitionist [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] from [[New England]] and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring [[Missouri]] rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a [[Slave states and free states|free state or a slave state]]. Thus, the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided, and was known as [[Bleeding Kansas]].

The first European to set foot in present-day Kansas was the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado]], who explored the area in 1541. In 1803, most of modern Kansas was [[United States territorial acquisitions|acquired by the United States]] as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Southwest Kansas, however, was still a part of Spain, Mexico, and the [[Republic of Texas]] until the conclusion of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1848, when these lands were [[Mexican Cession|ceded to the United States]]. From 1812 to 1821, Kansas was part of the [[Missouri Territory]]. The [[Santa Fe Trail]] traversed Kansas from 1821 to 1880, transporting manufactured goods from [[Missouri]] and silver and furs from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. Wagon ruts from the trail are still visible in the prairie today.\n\nIn 1827, [[Fort Leavenworth]] became the first permanent settlement of white Americans in the future state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a211662.pdf|title=A Brief History of Fort Leavenworth|author=Partin, John W. Partin|year=1983|access-date=January 24, 2019}}</ref> The [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] became law on May 30, 1854, establishing [[Nebraska Territory]] and [[Kansas Territory]], and opening the area to broader settlement by whites. [[Kansas Territory]] stretched all the way to the Continental Divide and included the sites of present-day [[Denver]], [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]].\n[[File:Battle of Lawrence.png|thumb|[[Lawrence Massacre|Quantrill's Raid]] on [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]]]]\n\nMissouri and [[Arkansas]] sent settlers into Kansas all along its eastern border. These settlers attempted to sway votes in favor of slavery. The secondary settlement of Americans in Kansas Territory were [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] from [[Massachusetts]] and other [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]], who attempted to stop the spread of slavery from neighboring Missouri. Directly presaging the [[American Civil War]], these forces collided, entering into skirmishes that earned the territory the name of [[Bleeding Kansas]].\n\nKansas was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] as a free state on January 29, 1861, making it the 34th state to join the United States. By that time, the violence in Kansas had largely subsided, but during the Civil War, on August 21, 1863, [[William Quantrill]] led several hundred men on a raid into [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], destroying much of the city and killing nearly 200 people. He was roundly condemned by both the conventional [[Confederate States Army|Confederate military]] and the partisan rangers commissioned by the [[Missouri legislature]]. His application to that body for a commission was flatly rejected due to his pre-war criminal record.<ref>Jones, ''Gray Ghosts and Rebel Riders'' Holt & Co. 1956, p. 76</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, many veterans constructed homesteads in Kansas. Many [[African Americans]] also looked to Kansas as the land of \"[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]\" and, led by [[freedmen]] like [[Benjamin \"Pap\" Singleton]], began establishing black colonies in the state. Leaving southern states in the late 1870s because of increasing discrimination, they became known as [[Exodusters]].\n\nAt the same time, the [[Chisholm Trail]] was opened and the [[American Old West|Wild West]]-era commenced in Kansas. [[Wild Bill Hickok]] was a deputy marshal at [[Fort Riley]] and a marshal at [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]] and [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]]. [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]] was another wild cowboy town, and both [[Bat Masterson]] and [[Wyatt Earp]] worked as lawmen in the town. In one year alone, eight million head of cattle from Texas boarded trains in Dodge City bound for the East, earning Dodge the nickname \"Queen of the Cowtowns\".\n\nIn response to demands of Methodists and other evangelical Protestants, in 1881 Kansas became the first U.S. state to adopt a constitutional amendment [[Prohibition|prohibiting]] all [[Alcohol laws of Kansas|alcoholic beverages]], which was repealed in 1948.\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:Great Plains LCC (14285769265).jpg|thumb|The [[Great Plains]] of Kansas]]\n[[File:Kanopolissp.JPG|thumb|[[Kanopolis State Park]]]]\n[[File:Wabaunsee County View.JPG|thumb|[[Flint Hills]] in Wabaunsee County]]\n\nKansas is bordered by [[Nebraska]] on the north; [[Missouri]] on the east; [[Oklahoma]] on the south; and [[Colorado]] on the west.

A sequence of [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]], [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] and [[Permian]] rocks outcrop in the eastern and southern part of the state. The state's western half has exposures of [[Cretaceous]] through Tertiary sediments, the latter derived from the [[erosion]] of the [[Tectonic uplift|uplifted]] [[Rocky Mountains]] to the west. These are underlain by older Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments which correlate well with the outcrops to the east. The state's northeastern corner was subjected to [[glaciation]] in the [[Pleistocene]] and is covered by [[glacial drift]] and [[loess]].\n\n===Topography===\n\nThe western two-thirds of the state, lying in the [[Great Plains|great central plain]] of the United States, has a generally flat or undulating surface, while the eastern third has many hills and forests.

The eastern two-thirds of the state (especially the northeastern portion) has a [[humid continental climate]], with cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Most of the precipitation falls during both the summer and the spring.\n\nThe western third of the state\u2014from roughly the [[U.S. Route 83]] corridor westward\u2014has a [[semi-arid climate|semiarid]] [[steppe]] climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters are highly changeable between warm and very cold. The western region receives an average of about {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}} of precipitation per year. [[Chinook wind]]s in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=off}} range.\n\nThe far south-central and southeastern portions of the state, including the [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] area, have a [[humid subtropical climate]] with hot and humid summers, milder winters, and more precipitation than elsewhere in Kansas. Some features of all three climates can be found in most of the state, with droughts and changeable weather between dry and humid not uncommon, and both warm and cold spells in the winter.\n\nTemperatures in areas between U.S. Routes 83 and [[U.S. Route 81|81]], as well as the southwestern portion of the state along and south of [[U.S. Route 50|U.S. 50]], reach {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=}} or above on most days of June, July, and August. High humidity added to the high temperatures sends the [[heat index]] into life-threatening territory, especially in Wichita, [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]], [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], [[Russell, Kansas|Russell]], [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]], and [[Great Bend, Kansas|Great Bend]]. Temperatures are often higher in [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]], [[Garden City, Kansas|Garden City]], and [[Liberal, Kansas|Liberal]], but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature.\n\nAlthough temperatures of {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} or higher are not as common in areas east of U.S. 81, higher humidity and the [[urban heat island]] effect lead most summer days to heat indices between {{convert|107|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and {{convert|114|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], and the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]]. During the summer, nightly low temperatures in the northeastern part of the state, especially in the aforementioned large cities, struggle to fall below {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Also, combined with humidity between 85 and 95 percent, dangerous heat indices can be experienced at every hour of the day.\n\nPrecipitation ranges from about {{convert|47|in|mm}} annually in the state's southeast corner to about {{convert|16|in|mm}} in the southwest. Snowfall ranges from around {{convert|5|in|mm}} in the fringes of the south, to {{convert|35|in|mm}} in the far northwest. Frost-free days range from more than 200 days in the south, to 130 days in the northwest. Thus, Kansas is the country's ninth or tenth sunniest state, depending on the source. Western Kansas is as sunny as parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].\n\nKansas is prone to severe weather, especially in the spring and the early-summer. Despite the frequent sunshine throughout much of the state, due to its location at a climatic boundary prone to intrusions of multiple air masses, the state is vulnerable to strong and severe thunderstorms. Some of these storms become [[supercell]] thunderstorms; these can produce some [[tornado]]es, occasionally those of [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF3]] strength or higher. Kansas averages more than 50 tornadoes annually.<ref name=\"Annual Average Number of Tornadoes\">{{cite web |title = Annual Average Number of Tornadoes, 1953\u20132004 |url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] |accessdate = October 25, 2006 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archivedate = October 16, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Severe thunderstorms sometimes drop some very large [[hail]] over Kansas as well. Furthermore, these storms can even bring in flash flooding and damaging straight line winds.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the all-time highest temperature recorded in Kansas is ({{convert|121|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}) on July 24, 1936, near [[Alton, Kansas|Alton]] in [[Osborne County, Kansas|Osborne County]], and the all-time low is {{convert|-40|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} on February 13, 1905, near [[Lebanon, Kansas|Lebanon]] in [[Smith County, Kansas|Smith County]]. Alton and Lebanon are approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}} apart.\n\nKansas's record high of {{convert|121|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|sigfig=3}} ties with [[North Dakota]] for the fifth-highest record high in an American state, behind California ({{convert|134|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), [[Arizona]] ({{convert|128|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), [[Nevada]] ({{convert|125|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), and [[New Mexico]] ({{convert|122|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or}}).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly Normal High and Low Temperatures For Various Kansas Cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n!

Production has experienced a steady, natural decline as it becomes increasingly difficult to extract oil over time. Since [[Price of oil|oil prices]] bottomed in 1999, oil production in Kansas has remained fairly constant, with an average monthly rate of about {{convert|2.8|Moilbbl|m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} in 2004. The [[Oil price increases since 2003|recent higher prices]] have made [[carbon dioxide]] sequestration and other oil recovery techniques more economical.\n\nKansas is also ranked eighth in US natural gas production. Production has steadily declined since the mid-1990s with the gradual depletion of the [[Hugoton Natural Gas Area|Hugoton Natural Gas Field]]\u2014the state's largest field which extends into Oklahoma and Texas. In 2004, slower declines in the Hugoton gas fields and increased [[coalbed methane]] production contributed to a smaller overall decline. Average monthly production was over {{convert|32|e9cuft|km3|abbr=off|sp=us}}.\n\nThe state's economy is also heavily influenced by the aerospace industry. Several large aircraft corporations have manufacturing facilities in Wichita and Kansas City, including [[Spirit AeroSystems]], [[Bombardier Aerospace]] ([[LearJet]]), and [[Textron Aviation]] (a merger of the former [[Cessna]], [[Hawker Aircraft|Hawker]], and [[Beechcraft]] brands). [[Boeing]] ended a decades-long history of manufacturing in Kansas between 2012 and 2013.\n\nMajor companies headquartered in Kansas include the [[Sprint Corporation]] (with world headquarters in [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]]), [[YRC Worldwide]] (Overland Park), [[Garmin]] ([[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]]), [[Payless Shoes]] (national headquarters and major distribution facilities in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]]), and [[Koch Industries]] (with national headquarters in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]), and [[Coleman Company|Coleman]] (headquarters in Wichita) . Telephone company [[Embarq]] formerly had its national headquarters in [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]] before its acquisition by [[CenturyTel]] in 2009, and still employs several hundred people in [[Gardner, Kansas|Gardner]].\n\nKansas is also home to three major military installations: [[Fort Leavenworth]] (Army), [[Fort Riley]] (Army), and [[McConnell Air Force Base]] (Air Force). Approximately 25,000 active duty soldiers and airmen are stationed at these bases which also employ approximately 8,000 civilian DoD employees. The US Army Reserve also has the 451st Expeditionary Sustainment Command headquartered in Wichita that serves reservists and their units from around the region. The Kansas Air National Guard has units at [[Forbes Field]] in Topeka and the 184th Intelligence Wing in Wichita. The Smoky Hill Weapons Range, a detachment of the Intelligence Wing, is one of the largest and busiest bombing ranges in the nation. During WWII, Kansas was home to numerous Army Air Corps training fields for training new pilots and aircrew. Many of those airfields live on today as municipal airports.\n\n===Taxes===\n\nTax is collected by the [[Kansas Department of Revenue]].\n\nRevenue shortfalls resulting from lower than expected tax collections and slower growth in personal income following a 1998 permanent tax reduction have contributed to the substantial growth in the state's debt level as bonded debt increased from $1.16&nbsp;billion in 1998 to $3.83&nbsp;billion in 2006. Some increase in debt was expected as the state continues with its 10-year Comprehensive Transportation Program enacted in 1999.\n\nIn 2003, Kansas had three income brackets for income tax calculation, ranging from 3.5% to 6.45%.\n\nThe state sales tax in Kansas is 6.15%. Various cities and counties in Kansas have an additional local sales tax. Except during the 2001 [[recession]] (March\u2013November 2001), when monthly sales tax collections were flat, collections have trended higher as the economy has grown and two rate increases have been enacted. If there had been no change in sales tax rates or in the economy, the total sales tax collections for 2003 would have been $1,797&nbsp;million, compared to $805.3&nbsp;million in 1990. However, they instead amounted to $1,630&nbsp;million an inflation-adjusted reduction of 10%. The state sales tax is a combined destination-based tax, meaning a single tax is applied that includes state, county, and local taxes, and the rate is based on where the consumer takes possession of the goods or services. Thanks to the destination structure and the numerous local special taxing districts, Kansas has 920 separate sales tax rates ranging from 6.5% to 11.5%.<ref>{{cite web |title = Publication 1700 |url = https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |website = Kansas Department of Revenue |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405025326/https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |archivedate = April 5, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> This taxing scheme, known as \"[[Streamlined Sales Tax]]\" was adopted on October 1, 2005, under the governorship of [[Kathleen Sebelius]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Streamlined Sales Tax\u2014Kansas |url = http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |website = Streamlined Sales Tax |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405090353/http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |archivedate = April 5, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Groceries are subject to sales tax in the state. All sales tax collected is remitted to the state department of revenue, and local taxes are then distributed to the various taxing agencies.\n\nAs of June 2004, [[Moody's Investors Service]] ranked the state 14th for net tax-supported debt per capita. As a percentage of personal income, it was at 3.8%\u2014above the median value of 2.5% for all rated states and having risen from a value of less than 1% in 1992. The state has a statutory requirement to maintain cash reserves of at least 7.5% of expenses at the end of each fiscal year; however, lawmakers can vote to override the rule, and did so during the most recent budget agreement.\n\n{{Main|Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117}}\n\nDuring his campaign for the 2010 election, Governor [[Sam Brownback]] called for a complete \"phase out of Kansas's income tax\".<ref name=\"theatlantic_tax_experiment_dead_2017\"/> In May 2012, Governor Brownback signed into law the '''Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117'''.<ref name=\"HB2117\">{{cite web |title = Senate Substitute for HB 2117 by Committee on Taxation\u2014Reduction of income tax rates for individuals and determination of income tax credits; severance tax exemptions; homestead property tax refunds; food sales tax refunds |url = http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/measures/hb2117/ |accessdate = October 29, 2014 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141030002120/http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/measures/hb2117/ |archivedate = October 30, 2014 |df = mdy-all}}</ref> Starting in 2013, the \"ambitious tax overhaul\" trimmed income tax, eliminated some corporate taxes, and created [[Flow-through entity|pass-through income]] tax exemptions, he raised the sales tax by one percent to offset the loss to state revenues but that was inadequate.

The rise of the Tea Party and the election of President Obama have prompted Republicans to embrace a purer brand of conservatism and purge what had long been a robust moderate wing from its ranks.

In lieu of the state retail sales tax, a 10% Liquor Drink Tax is collected for liquor consumed on the licensed premises and an 8% Liquor Enforcement Tax is collected on retail purchases. Although the sale of cereal [[malt beverage]] (also known as [[3.2 beer]]) was legalized in 1937, the first post-[[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] legalization of alcoholic liquor did not occur until the [[Kansas Constitution|state's constitution]] was amended in 1948. The following year the [[Kansas Legislature|Legislature]] enacted the Liquor Control Act which created a system of regulating, licensing, and taxing, and the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) was created to enforce the act. The power to regulate cereal malt beverage remains with the cities and counties. Liquor-by-the-drink did not become legal until passage of an amendment to the state's constitution in 1986 and additional legislation the following year. As of November 2006, Kansas still has 29 [[dry county|dry counties]] and only 17 counties have passed liquor-by-the-drink with no food sales requirement.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ksrevenue.org/abcsupplierinfo.htm |title = Liquor Licensee and Supplier Information |publisher = Alcoholic Beverage Control, Kansas Department of Revenue |accessdate = January 18, 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061208194850/http://www.ksrevenue.org/abcsupplierinfo.htm |archivedate = December 8, 2006 }}</ref> Today there are more than 2,600 liquor and 4,000 cereal malt beverage licensees in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ksrevenue.org/abchistory.htm |title = History of Alcoholic Beverages in Kansas |publisher = Alcoholic Beverage Control, Kansas Department of Revenue |year = 2000 |accessdate = January 18, 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070117070410/http://www.ksrevenue.org/abchistory.htm |archivedate = January 17, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n\n{{Main|Education in Kansas}}\n\nEducation in Kansas is governed at the primary and secondary school level by the [[Kansas State Board of Education]].

The teams are rivals in the [[Big 12 Conference]].\n\nBoth KU and K-State have tradition-rich programs in men's basketball. The Jayhawks are a perennial national power, ranking second in all-time victories among NCAA programs, behind [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]]. The Jayhawks have won five national titles, including NCAA tournament championships in 1952, 1988, and 2008. They also were retroactively awarded national championships by the [[Helms Foundation]] for 1922 and 1923. K-State also had a long stretch of success on the hardwood, lasting from the 1940s to the 1980s, making four [[Final Four]]s during that stretch. In 1988, KU and K-State met in the [[Elite Eight]], KU taking the game 71\u201358. After a 12-year absence, the Wildcats returned to the NCAA tournament in 2008, and advanced to the Elite Eight in 2010 and 2018. KU is fifth all-time with 15 Final Four appearances, while K-State's four appearances are tied for 17th.\n\nConversely, success on the [[American football|gridiron]] has been less frequent for both KSU and KU. However, there have been recent breakthroughs for both schools' football teams. The Jayhawks won the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] for the first time in three tries in 2008, capping a 12\u20131 season, the best in school history. And when [[Bill Snyder]] arrived to coach at K-State in 1989, he turned the Wildcats from one of the worst college football programs in America,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Looney |first=Douglas |title=Futility U |journal=Sports Illustrated |date=September 4, 1989 |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/09/04/120464/futility-u-kansas-state-winless-since-1986-has-one-claim-to-fame-it-is-americas-most-hapless-team}}</ref> into a national force for most of the 1990s and early 2000s. The team won the [[Fiesta Bowl]] in 1997, achieved an undefeated (11\u20130) regular season and No.{{nbsp}}1 ranking in 1998, and took the [[Big 12 Conference]] championship in 2003. After three seasons in which K-State football languished, Snyder came out of retirement in 2009 and guided them to the top of the college football ranks again, finishing second in the Big 12 in 2011 and earning a berth in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]], and winning the Big 12 again in 2012.\n\n[[Wichita State University]], which also fields teams (called the [[Wichita State Shockers|Shockers]]) in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], is best known for its baseball and basketball programs. In baseball, the Shockers won the [[College World Series]] in 1989. In men's basketball, they appeared in the Final Four in 1965 and 2013, and entered the 2014 NCAA tournament unbeaten. The school also fielded a [[American football|football]] team from 1897 to 1986. The Shocker football team is tragically known for a [[Wichita State University football team plane crash|plane crash]] in 1970 that killed 31 people, including 14 players.\n\n=====NCAA Division II schools=====\n\nNotable success has also been achieved by the state's smaller schools in football. [[Pittsburg State University]], an NCAA Division II participant, has claimed four national titles in football, two in the NAIA and most recently the 2011 NCAA Division II national title. Pittsburg State became the winningest NCAA Division II football program in 1995. PSU passed Hillsdale College at the top of the all-time victories list in the 1995 season on its march to the national runner-up finish. The Gorillas, in 96 seasons of intercollegiate competition, have accumulated 579 victories, posting a 579\u2013301\u201348 overall mark.\n\n[[Washburn University]], in Topeka, won the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] Men's Basketball Championship in 1987. The [[Fort Hays State University]] men won the 1996 NCAA Division II title with a 34\u20130 record, and the Washburn women won the 2005 NCAA Division II crown. St. Benedict's College (now Benedictine College), in Atchison, won the 1954 and 1967 Men's NAIA Basketball Championships.\n\nThe [[Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference]] has its roots as one of the oldest college sport conferences in existence and participates in the NAIA and all ten member schools are in the state of Kansas. Other smaller school conferences that have some members in Kansas are the [[Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association]] the [[Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference]], the [[Midwest Christian College Conference]], and the [[Heart of America Athletic Conference]]. Many [[junior college]]s also have active athletic programs.\n\n[[Emporia State]]'s women's basketball team, under head coach [[Brandon Schneider]], who is now serving as the women's basketball coach at the University of Kansas, has seen success as well. In 2010 the team won the NCAA Division II National Championship. Emporia State and Washburn in Topeka share a heated rivalry in all sports, mostly due to the close proximity of both cities.\n\n=====Junior Colleges=====\n\nThe [[Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference]] has been heralded as one of the best conferences in all of [[NJCAA]] football, with [[Garden City Community College]], [[Independence Community College]], and [[Butler County Community College]] all consistently in contention for national championships.\n\n====High school====\n\nThe [[Kansas State High School Activities Association]] (KSHSAA) is the organization which oversees interscholastic competition in the state of Kansas at the high school level. It oversees both athletic and non-athletic competition, and sponsors championships in several sports and activities. The association is perhaps best known for devising the overtime system now used for almost all football games below the professional level (which has also been adopted at all levels of [[Canadian football]]).\n\n==Notable people==\n\n{{Main|List of people from Kansas}}\n\n==Landmarks==\n\n{{Main|List of Kansas landmarks}}\n{{See also|National Register of Historic Places listings in Kansas}}\n\n==See also==\n\n{{portal|Kansas|United States}}\n* [[Index of Kansas-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Kansas]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n<!--Note: the section name \"Bibliography\" is linked from other articles, posted in April 2018 by User:Sbmeirow-->\n{{See also|History of Kansas#Bibliography|l1=Longer list of books about the history of Kansas}}\n* {{Cite book |last1=Mechem |first1=Kirke |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1911 to 1925 |date=1956 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |isbn= |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/212250/ }}; 559 pages.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Mechem |first1=Kirke |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1886 to 1910 |date=1954 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |isbn= |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/212249/ }}; 535 pages.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Wilder |first1=Daniel W. |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1541 to 1885 |date=1886 |publisher=Kansas Publishing House |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/223666}}; 1204 pages.\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Connelley |editor-first=William E. |title=A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans |publisher=Lewis Publishing Company |year=1918 |url=http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1918ks/toc.html }}; 5 volumes; 2731 pages; ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo00conn/ Vol1]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo02conn/ Vol2]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo03conn/ Vol3]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo04conn/ Vol4]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo05conn/ Vol5]); the 1919 edition contains additional biographies.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Connelley |first1=William E. |title=History of Kansas Newspapers: A History of the Newspapers and Magazines Published in Kansas from 1854 to 1916 |date=1916 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/211020/ }}; 369 pages.\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Blackmar |editor-first=Frank W. |title=Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Embracing Events, Institutions, Industries, Counties, Cities, Towns, Prominent Persons, Etc |publisher = Standard Publishing Co |year=1912 |url=http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1912/ }}; 3 volumes; 2723 pages; ([https://archive.org/details/kansascyc01blac/ Vol1]), ([https://archive.org/details/kansascycloped02blac/ Vol2]), ([https://archive.org/details/kansascyclopedia03blac/ Vol3])\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Everts |editor-first=Louis H. |title=Official State Atlas of Kansas |publisher=L.H.

{"title_page": "German entry into World War I", "text_new": "[[German Empire|Germany]] entered into [[World War I]] on August 1, 1914, when it declared war on [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. In accordance with [[Schlieffen Plan|its war plan]], it ignored Russia and moved first against [[French Third Republic|France]]\u2013declaring war on August 3 and sending its main armies through [[Belgium]] to attack [[Paris]] from the north. The [[German invasion of Belgium]] caused [[British Empire|Britain]] to declare war on Germany on August 4. Most of the main parties were now at war. In October 1914, [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] joined the war on Germany's side, becoming part of the [[Central Powers]]. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], which [[Triple Alliance (1882)|was allied]] with Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] before World War I, was neutral in 1914 before [[London Pact|switching]] to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] side in May 1915.\n\nHistorians have vigorously debated Germany's role. One line of interpretation, promoted by German historian [[Fritz Fischer]] in the 1960s, argues that Germany had long desired to dominate Europe politically and economically, and seized the opportunity that unexpectedly opened in July 1914, making her guilty of starting the war. At the opposite end of the moral spectrum, many historians have argued that the war was inadvertent, caused by a series of complex accidents that overburdened the long-standing alliance system with its lock-step mobilization system that no\u2013one could control. A third approach, especially important in recent years, is that Germany saw itself surrounded by increasingly powerful enemies\u2013Russia, France and Britain\u2013who would eventually crush it unless Germany acted defensively with a [[preemptive strike]].<ref>Mark Hewitson.

When the war started Italy declared neutrality; in 1915 it switched and joined the [[Triple Entente]] (i.e. the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]).]]\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Causes of World War I}}\n\nAs the war started, Germany stood behind its ally Austria-Hungary in a confrontation with [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], but Serbia was under the protection of [[Russian Empire|Russia]], which was [[Franco-Russian Alliance|allied to France]]. Germany was the leader of the Central Powers, which included Austria-Hungary at the start of the war, and later included the Ottoman Empire and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]; arrayed against them were the Allies, consisting chiefly of Russia, France and Britain at the beginning of the war, Italy, which joined the Allies in 1915, and the [[United States]], which joined the Allies in 1917.\n\nThere were several main [[causes of World War I]], which broke out unexpectedly in June\u2013August 1914, including the conflicts and hostility of the previous four decades. [[Militarism]], [[alliance]]s, [[imperialism]], and [[ethnic nationalism]] played major roles. However the immediate origins of the war lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the [[July Crisis of 1914]], which was sparked by [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|the assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, by a Serbian secret organization, the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]].<ref>Christopher Clark, ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' (2012)</ref>\n\nSince the 1870s or 1880s all the major powers had been preparing for a large-scale war, although none expected one. Britain focused on building up its [[Royal Navy]], already stronger than the next two navies combined. Germany, France, Austria, Italy and Russia and some smaller countries set up [[conscription]] systems whereby young men would serve from one to three years in the army, then spend the next 20 years or so in the reserves with annual summer training. Men of higher social status became [[Military officer|officers]].<ref>F. H. Hinsley, ed.

Every year the plans were updated and increased in complexity. Each country stockpiled arms and supplies for an army that ran into the millions. Germany in 1874 had a regular professional army of 420,000, with an additional 1.3 million reserves. By 1897, the regular German army was 545,000 strong and the reserves 3.4 million. The French in 1897 had 3.4 million reservists, Austria 2.6 million, and Russia 4.0 million. All major countries had a [[general staff]] which designed war plans against possible enemies.<ref>Paul M.

On 25 July 1914, the SPD leadership appealed to its membership to demonstrate for peace and large numbers turned out in orderly demonstrations.  The SPD was not revolutionary and many members were nationalistic. When the war began, some conservatives wanted to use force to suppress the SPD, but Bethmann-Hollweg wisely refused.  The SPD members of parliament voted 96-14 on 3 August to support the war. There remained an antiwar element especially in Berlin.  They were expelled from the SPD in 1916 and formed the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]].<ref>V. R.

American historian [[Paul Schroeder]] agrees with the critics that Fischer exaggerated and misinterpreted many points. However, Schroeder endorses Fischer's basic conclusion:\n: From 1890 on, Germany did pursue world power. This bid arose from deep roots within Germany's economic, political, and social structures. Once the war broke out, world power became Germany's essential goal.<ref>Paul W. Schroeder, \"World War I as Galloping Gertie: A Reply to Joachim Remak,\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 44#3 (1972), pp. 319-345, at p/ 320 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1876415 online]</ref>\n\nHowever, Schroeder argues, all that was not the main cause of the war in 1914\u2014Indeed the search for a single main cause is not a helpful approach to history. Instead, there are multiple causes any one or two of which could have launched the war. He argues, \"The fact that so many plausible explanations for the outbreak of the war have been advanced over the years indicates on the one hand that it was massively overdetermined, and on the other that no effort to analyze the causal factors involved can ever fully succeed.\"<ref>Schroeder p 320</ref>\n\nMany historians in recent years have stressed that insecurity about the future deeply troubled German policy makers and motivated them toward preemptive war before it was too late. The nation was surrounded by enemies who were getting stronger; the bid to rival British naval supremacy had failed.<ref>Matthew S. Seligmann, \"\u2018A Barometer of National Confidence\u2019: a British Assessment of the Role of Insecurity in the Formulation of German Military Policy before the First World War.\" ''English Historical Review'' 117.471 (2002): 333-355.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/579563 online]</ref> Bethmann-Hollweg was mesmerized by the steady growth of Russian power, which was in large part due to French financial and technical assistance. For the Germans, this deepened the worry often expressed by the Kaiser that Germany was being surrounded by enemies who were growing in strength.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jo Groebel and Robert A. Hinde, eds.|title=Aggression and War: Their Biological and Social Bases|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjIxRLjPR8wC&pg=PA196|year=1989|page=196}}</ref> One implication was that time was against them, and a war happening sooner would be more advantageous for Germany than a war happening later. For the French, there was a growing fear that Russia would become significantly more powerful than France, and become more independent of France, possibly even returning to its old military alliance with Germany. The implication was that a war sooner could count on the Russian alliance, but the longer it waited the greater the likelihood of a Russian alliance with Germany that would doom France.<ref>Otte, ''July Crisis'' (2014) pp 99, 135-36.</ref>\n\nFrance, a third smaller than Germany, needed Russia's vast potential, and the fear was that together the two would in a few years clearly surpass Germany's military capability. This argued for war sooner rather than later. Bethmann-Hollweg knew he was undertaking a calculated risk by backing a local war in which Austria would politically destroy Serbia. The hope was to \"localize\" that war by keeping the other powers out of it. Russia had no treaty obligations to Serbia, but was trying to fashion itself as the leader of the Slavic peoples in opposition to their German and Austrian oppressors. If Russia intervened to defend Serbia, Germany would have to intervene to defend Austria, and very likely France would honor its treaty obligation and join with Russia. Bethmann-Hollweg assumed Britain had no interest in the [[Balkans]] and would remain neutral. It was also possible that Russia would go to war but France would not follow, in which case the [[Triple Entente]] would become meaningless. The calculated risk failed when Russia mobilized. The German general staff, which was always hawkish and eager for war, now took control of German policy. Its war plan called for immediate action before Russia could mobilize much force, and instead use very rapid mobilization of German active duty and reserve forces to invade France through Belgium. Once France was knocked out, the German troops would be sent to the East to defeat Russia with the assistance of the Austrian army. Once Russia mobilized, on July 31, Austria and Germany mobilized. The Germans had a very sophisticated plan for rapid mobilization. It worked well while everyone else was days or weeks behind. The general staff convinced the Kaiser to activate their war plan, and Bethmann-Hollweg could only follow along. Most historians treat the Kaiser as a man far out of his depth who was under the spell of the Army General staff.<ref>Konrad H.

France responded by expanding the training period for all draftees from two years to three. Russia likewise raised its army size to a wartime basis of 5.4 million. Austria in 1913 raised its war strength to 2.0 million.

Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a profound moral and diplomatic crime. Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870 \u2014 when [[Prussia]] and the German states smashed France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] \u2014 would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policymakers insisted that that would be a catastrophe for British security.<ref>Paul M.

The resulting naval race heightened tensions between the two nations. In 1897, Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] became German Naval Secretary of State and began transformation of the [[Imperial German Navy]] from a small, coastal defence force to a fleet that was meant to challenge British naval power. As part of the wider bid to alter the international balance of power decisively in Germany's favour, Tirpitz called for a ''Risikoflotte'' (Risk Fleet), so called because, although still smaller than the British fleet, it would be too large for Britain to risk taking it on.<ref>William L.

Vienna delayed its critical ultimatum until July 23, and its actual invasion until August 13. That allowed time for the Russian-French opposition to organize. It also allowed an investigation to turn up many details but no evidence pointing directly to the government of Serbia. The main reason for the delay was the fact that practically the entire Austrian army was tied down at home in harvest work, providing a food supply that would be essential for any war once the reserves were called to duty.<ref>Richard F.

The statement said:\n: it was clear to Austria that it was not compatible with the dignity and the spirit of self-preservation of the monarchy to view idly any longer this agitation across the border. The Imperial and Royal Government appraised Germany of this conception and asked for our opinion. With all our heart we were able to agree with our ally's estimate of the situation, and assure him that any action considered necessary to end the movement in Servia (sic) directed against the conservation of the monarchy would meet with our approval.  We were perfectly aware that a possible warlike attitude of Austria-Hungary against Servia might bring Russia upon the field, and that it might therefore involve us in a war, in accordance with our duty as allies. We could not, however, in these vital interests of Austria-Hungary, which were at stake, advise our ally to take a yielding attitude not compatible with his dignity, nor deny him our assistance in these trying days. We could do this all the less as our own interests were menaced through the continued Serb agitation. If the Serbs continued with the aid of Russia and France to menace the existence of Austria-Hungary, the gradual collapse of Austria and the subjection of all the Slavs under one Russian sceptre would be the consequence, thus making untenable the position of the Teutonic race in Central Europe.<ref>See [https://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_German_White_Book  \"The German White Book\" (1914)]</ref>\n\n==July:  crisis and war==\n{{Further|July Crisis|Central Powers}}\nIn early July 1914, in the aftermath of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and the immediate likelihood of war between Austria-Hungary and [[Serbia]], the German government informed the Austro-Hungarian government that Germany would uphold its alliance with Austria-Hungary and defend it from possible Russian intervention if a war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia took place.\n\nAustria depended entirely on Germany for support \u2013 it had no other ally it could trust\u2013 but the Kaiser lost control of the German government. Bethmann-Hollweg had repeatedly rejected pleas from Britain and Russia to put pressure on Austria to compromise. German elite and popular public opinion also was demanding mediation. Now in late July he reversed himself, and pleaded, or demanded, that Austria accept mediation, warning that Britain would probably join Russia and France if a larger war started. The Kaiser made a direct appeal to Emperor [[Franz Joseph]] along the same lines. However, Bethmann-Hollweg  and the Kaiser did not know that the German military had its own line of communication to the Austrian military, and insisted on rapid mobilization against Russia. German Chief of Staff Moltke sent an emotional telegram to the Austrian Chief of Staff Conrad on July 30: \"Austria-Hungary must be preserved, mobilise at once against Russia. Germany will mobilise.\" Vienna officials decided that Moltke was really in charge\u2014which was true\u2014and refused mediation and mobilized against Russia.<ref>Margaret MacMillan, ''The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914 '' (2013) pp 605-607.</ref>\n\nWhen Russia enacted a [[general mobilization]], Germany viewed the act as provocative.  The Russian government promised Germany that its general mobilization did not mean preparation for war with Germany but was a reaction to the events between Austria-Hungary and Serbia.  The German government regarded the Russian promise of no war with Germany to be nonsense in light of its general mobilization, and Germany, in turn, mobilized for war.  On 1 August, Germany sent an ultimatum to Russia stating that since both Germany and Russia were in a state of military mobilization, an effective state of war existed between the two countries. Later that day, France, an ally of Russia, declared a state of general mobilization. The German government justified military action against Russia as necessary because of Russian aggression as demonstrated by the mobilization of the Russian army that had resulted in Germany mobilizing in response.<ref>Richard F. Hamilton and Holger H. Herwig, ''Decisions for War, 1914-1917 (2004), pp 70-91.</ref>\n\nAfter Germany declared war on Russia, France with its alliance with Russia prepared a general mobilization in expectation of war. On 3 August 1914, Germany responded to this action by declaring war on France. Germany, facing a two-front war, enacted what was known as the [[Schlieffen Plan]], which involved German armed forces needing to move through Belgium and swing south into France and towards the French capital of Paris. This plan aimed to gain a quick victory against the French and allow German forces to concentrate on the Eastern Front. Belgium was a neutral country and would not accept German forces crossing its territory. Germany disregarded Belgian neutrality and invaded the country to launch an offensive towards Paris. This caused Great Britain to declare war against the German Empire, as the action violated the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]] that both Britain and Prussia had signed in 1839 guaranteeing Belgian neutrality and defense of the kingdom if a nation reneged.\n\nSubsequently, several states declared war on Germany in late August 1914, with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] declaring war on Austria-Hungary in 1915 and Germany on 27 August 1916; the United States on 6 April 1917 and [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] in July 1917.\n\n==Ottoman ally==\n{{Main|Ottoman entry into World War I}}\n[[File:Balkans attack Turkey in 1912, Danish cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|1912 Danish cartoon shows Balkan states tearing apart the rickety Ottoman Empire in [[First Balkan War]], October 1912]]\nTurkey had been badly defeated in a series of wars in the previous decade, losing the two [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912-13 and the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in 1911-12.<ref>R.

In accordance with [[Schlieffen Plan|its war plan]], it ignored Russia and moved first against [[French Third Republic|France]]\u2013declaring war on August 3 and sending its main armies through [[Belgium]] to attack [[Paris]] from the north. The [[German invasion of Belgium]] caused [[British Empire|Britain]] to declare war on Germany on August 4. Most of the main parties were now at war. In October 1914, [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] joined the war on Germany's side, becoming part of the [[Central Powers]]. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], which [[Triple Alliance (1882)|was allied]] with Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] before World War I, was neutral in 1914 before [[London Pact|switching]] to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] side in May 1915.\n\nHistorians have vigorously debated Germany's role. One line of interpretation, promoted by German historian [[Fritz Fischer]] in the 1960s, argues that Germany had long desired to dominate Europe politically and economically, and seized the opportunity that unexpectedly opened in July 1914, making her guilty of starting the war. At the opposite end of the moral spectrum, many historians have argued that the war was inadvertent, caused by a series of complex accidents that overburdened the long-standing alliance system with its lock-step mobilization system that no\u2013one could control. A third approach, especially important in recent years, is that Germany saw itself surrounded by increasingly powerful enemies\u2013Russia, France and Britain\u2013who would eventually crush it unless Germany acted defensively with a [[preemptive strike]].<ref> Mark Hewitson. ''Germany and the Causes of the First World War'' (2004) pp 1-20.</ref>\n\n[[File:WWIchartX.svg|350px|thumb|Military alignments in 1914. When the war started Italy declared neutrality; in 1915 it switched and joined the [[Triple Entente]] (i.e. the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]).]]\n\n==Background==\n{{main article|Causes of World War I}}\n\nAs the war started, Germany stood behind its ally Austria-Hungary in a confrontation with [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], but Serbia was under the protection of [[Russian_Empire|Russia]], which was [[Franco-Russian Alliance|allied to France]]. Germany was the leader of the Central Powers, which included Austria-Hungary at the start of the war, and later included the Ottoman Empire and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]; arrayed against them were the Allies, consisting chiefly of Russia, France and Britain at the beginning of the war, Italy, which joined the Allies in 1915, and the [[United States]], which joined the Allies in 1917.\n\nThere were several main [[causes of World War I]], which broke out unexpectedly in June\u2013August 1914, including the conflicts and hostility of the previous four decades. [[Militarism]], [[alliance]]s, [[imperialism]], and [[ethnic nationalism]] played major roles. However the immediate origins of the war lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the [[July Crisis of 1914]], which was sparked by [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|the assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, by a Serbian secret organization, the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]].<ref>Christopher Clark, ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' (2012) </ref>\n\nSince the 1870s or 1880s all the major powers had been preparing for a large-scale war, although none expected one. Britain focused on building up its [[Royal Navy]], already stronger than the next two navies combined. Germany, France, Austria, Italy and Russia and some smaller countries set up [[conscription]] systems whereby young men would serve from one to three years in the army, then spend the next 20 years or so in the reserves with annual summer training. Men of higher social status became [[Military officer|officers]].<ref>F. H. Hinsley, ed. ''The New Cambridge Modern History, Vol. 11: Material Progress and World-Wide Problems, 1870-98'' (1962) pp 204-42, esp 214-17.</ref>\n\nEach country devised a [[mobilisation]] system whereby the reserves could be called up quickly and sent to key points by rail. Every year the plans were updated and increased in complexity. Each country stockpiled arms and supplies for an army that ran into the millions. Germany in 1874 had a regular professional army of 420,000, with an additional 1.3 million reserves. By 1897, the regular German army was 545,000 strong and the reserves 3.4 million. The French in 1897 had 3.4 million reservists, Austria 2.6 million, and Russia 4.0 million. All major countries had a [[general staff]] which designed war plans against possible enemies.<ref>Paul M. Kennedy, ed., ''The War Plans of the Great Powers, 1880-1914'' (1979)</ref> All plans called for a decisive opening and a short war.<ref>Hinsley (1962) pp 204-42.</ref> Germany's [[Schlieffen Plan]] was the most elaborate; the [[Imperial German Army|German Army]] was so confident that it would succeed that they made no alternative plans.

The SPD was not revolutionary and many members were nationalistic. When the war began, some conservatives wanted to use force to suppress the SPD, but Bethmann-Hollweg wisely refused.  The SPD members of parliament voted 96-14 on 3 August to support the war. There remained an antiwar element especially in Berlin.  They were expelled from the SPD in 1916 and formed the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]].<ref>V. R.

American historian [[Paul Schroeder]] agrees with the critics that Fischer exaggerated and misinterpreted many points. However, Schroeder endorses Fischer's basic conclusion:\n: From 1890 on, Germany did pursue world power. This bid arose from deep roots within Germany's economic, political, and social structures. Once the war broke out, world power became Germany's essential goal.<ref>Paul W. Schroeder, \"World War I as Galloping Gertie: A Reply to Joachim Remak,\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 44#3 (1972), pp. 319-345, at p/ 320 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1876415 online]</ref> \n\nHowever, Schroeder argues, all that was not the main cause of the war in 1914--Indeed the search for a single main cause is not a helpful approach to history. Instead, there are multiple causes any one or two of which could have launched the war. He argues, \"The fact that so many plausible explanations for the outbreak of the war have been advanced over the years indicates on the one hand that it was massively overdetermined, and on the other that no effort to analyze the causal factors involved can ever fully succeed.\"<ref> Schroeder p 320</ref>\n\nMany historians in recent years have stressed that insecurity about the future deeply troubled German policy makers and motivated them toward preemptive war before it was too late. The nation was surrounded by enemies who were getting stronger; the bid to rival British naval supremacy had failed.<ref>Matthew S. Seligmann, \"\u2018A Barometer of National Confidence\u2019: a British Assessment of the Role of Insecurity in the Formulation of German Military Policy before the First World War.\" ''English Historical Review'' 117.471 (2002): 333-355.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/579563 online]</ref> Bethmann-Hollweg was mesmerized by the steady growth of Russian power, which was in large part due to French financial and technical assistance. For the Germans, this deepened the worry often expressed by the Kaiser that Germany was being surrounded by enemies who were growing in strength.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jo Groebel and Robert A.

For the French, there was a growing fear that Russia would become significantly more powerful than France, and become more independent of France, possibly even returning to its old military alliance with Germany. The implication was that a war sooner could count on the Russian alliance, but the longer it waited the greater the likelihood of a Russian alliance with Germany that would doom France.<ref>Otte, ''July Crisis'' (2014) pp 99, 135-36.</ref>\n\nFrance, a third smaller than Germany, needed Russia's vast potential, and the fear was that together the two would in a few years clearly surpass Germany's military capability. This argued for war sooner rather than later. Bethmann-Hollweg knew he was undertaking a calculated risk by backing a local war in which Austria would politically destroy Serbia. The hope was to \"localize\" that war by keeping the other powers out of it. Russia had no treaty obligations to Serbia, but was trying to fashion itself as the leader of the Slavic peoples in opposition to their German and Austrian oppressors. If Russia intervened to defend Serbia, Germany would have to intervene to defend Austria, and very likely France would honor its treaty obligation and join with Russia. Bethmann-Hollweg assumed Britain had no interest in the [[Balkans]] and would remain neutral. It was also possible that Russia would go to war but France would not follow, in which case the [[Triple Entente]] would become meaningless. The calculated risk failed when Russia mobilized. The German general staff, which was always hawkish and eager for war, now took control of German policy. Its war plan called for immediate action before Russia could mobilize much force, and instead use very rapid mobilization of German active duty and reserve forces to invade France through Belgium. Once France was knocked out, the German troops would be sent to the East to defeat Russia with the assistance of the Austrian army. Once Russia mobilized, on July 31, Austria and Germany mobilized. The Germans had a very sophisticated plan for rapid mobilization. It worked well while everyone else was days or weeks behind. The general staff convinced the Kaiser to activate their war plan, and Bethmann-Hollweg could only follow along. Most historians treat the Kaiser as a man far out of his depth who was under the spell of the Army General staff. <ref>Konrad H.

Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a profound moral and diplomatic crime. Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870 \u2014 when [[Prussia]] and the German states smashed France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] \u2014 would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policymakers insisted that that would be a catastrophe for British security.<ref>Paul M.

The resulting naval race heightened tensions between the two nations. In 1897, Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] became German Naval Secretary of State and began transformation of the [[Imperial German Navy]] from a small, coastal defence force to a fleet that was meant to challenge British naval power. As part of the wider bid to alter the international balance of power decisively in Germany's favour, Tirpitz called for a ''Risikoflotte'' (Risk Fleet), so called because, although still smaller than the British fleet, it would be too large for Britain to risk taking it on.<ref>William L.

Vienna delayed its critical ultimatum until July 23, and its actual invasion until August 13. That allowed time for the Russian-French opposition to organize. It also allowed an investigation to turn up many details but no evidence pointing directly to the government of Serbia. The main reason for the delay was the fact that practically the entire Austrian army was tied down at home in harvest work, providing a food supply that would be essential for any war once the reserves were called to duty.<ref>Richard F.

It meant that Germany would support whatever decision Austria made. Austria decided on war with Serbia, which quickly led to escalation with Russia. Bethmann-Hollweg on July 6 told [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Sz\u0151gy\u00e9ny-Marich Jr.|the Austrian ambassador in Berlin]]:\n\n:Finally, as far as concerns Serbia, His Majesty, of course, cannot interfere in the dispute now going on between Austria-Hungary and that country, as it is a matter not within his competence. The Emperor Francis Joseph may, however, rest assured that His Majesty will faithfully stand by Austria-Hungary,[''editor: Bethmann-Hollweg here deleted the phrase \"under all circumstances\" which had appeared in his first draft''] as is required by the obligations of his alliance and of his ancient friendship.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Claudia Durst Johnson|author2=James H.

The statement said:\n: it was clear to Austria that it was not compatible with the dignity and the spirit of self-preservation of the monarchy to view idly any longer this agitation across the border. The Imperial and Royal Government appraised Germany of this conception and asked for our opinion. With all our heart we were able to agree with our ally's estimate of the situation, and assure him that any action considered necessary to end the movement in Servia (sic) directed against the conservation of the monarchy would meet with our approval.  We were perfectly aware that a possible warlike attitude of Austria-Hungary against Servia might bring Russia upon the field, and that it might therefore involve us in a war, in accordance with our duty as allies. We could not, however, in these vital interests of Austria-Hungary, which were at stake, advise our ally to take a yielding attitude not compatible with his dignity, nor deny him our assistance in these trying days. We could do this all the less as our own interests were menaced through the continued Serb agitation. If the Serbs continued with the aid of Russia and France to menace the existence of Austria-Hungary, the gradual collapse of Austria and the subjection of all the Slavs under one Russian sceptre would be the consequence, thus making untenable the position of the Teutonic race in Central Europe.<ref>See [https://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_German_White_Book  \"The German White Book\" (1914)]</ref>\n\n==July:  crisis and war==\n{{Further|July Crisis|Central Powers}}\nIn early July 1914, in the aftermath of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and the immediate likelihood of war between Austria-Hungary and [[Serbia]], the German government informed the Austro-Hungarian government that Germany would uphold its alliance with Austria-Hungary and defend it from possible Russian intervention if a war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia took place. \n\nAustria depended entirely on Germany for support \u2013 it had no other ally it could trust\u2013 but the Kaiser lost control of the German government. Bethmann-Hollweg had repeatedly rejected pleas from Britain and Russia to put pressure on Austria to compromise. German elite and popular public opinion also was demanding mediation. Now in late July he reversed himself, and pleaded, or demanded, that Austria accept mediation, warning that Britain would probably join Russia and France if a larger war started. The Kaiser made a direct appeal to Emperor [[Franz Joseph]] along the same lines. However, Bethmann-Hollweg  and the Kaiser did not know that the German military had its own line of communication to the Austrian military, and insisted on rapid mobilization against Russia. German Chief of Staff Moltke sent an emotional telegram to the Austrian Chief of Staff Conrad on July 30: \"Austria-Hungary must be preserved, mobilise at once against Russia. Germany will mobilise.\" Vienna officials decided that Moltke was really in charge--which was true--and refused mediation and mobilized against Russia.<ref>Margaret MacMillan, ''The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914 '' (2013) pp 605-607.  </ref> \n\nWhen Russia enacted a [[general mobilization]], Germany viewed the act as provocative.  The Russian government promised Germany that its general mobilization did not mean preparation for war with Germany but was a reaction to the events between Austria-Hungary and Serbia.  The German government regarded the Russian promise of no war with Germany to be nonsense in light of its general mobilization, and Germany, in turn, mobilized for war.  On 1 August, Germany sent an ultimatum to Russia stating that since both Germany and Russia were in a state of military mobilization, an effective state of war existed between the two countries. Later that day, France, an ally of Russia, declared a state of general mobilization. The German government justified military action against Russia as necessary because of Russian aggression as demonstrated by the mobilization of the Russian army that had resulted in Germany mobilizing in response.<ref>Richard F. Hamilton and Holger H. Herwig, ''Decisions for War, 1914-1917 (2004), pp 70-91. </ref>\n\nAfter Germany declared war on Russia, France with its alliance with Russia prepared a general mobilization in expectation of war. On 3 August 1914, Germany responded to this action by declaring war on France. Germany, facing a two-front war, enacted what was known as the [[Schlieffen Plan]], which involved German armed forces needing to move through Belgium and swing south into France and towards the French capital of Paris. This plan aimed to gain a quick victory against the French and allow German forces to concentrate on the Eastern Front. Belgium was a neutral country and would not accept German forces crossing its territory. Germany disregarded Belgian neutrality and invaded the country to launch an offensive towards Paris. This caused Great Britain to declare war against the German Empire, as the action violated the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]] that both Britain and Prussia had signed in 1839 guaranteeing Belgian neutrality and defense of the kingdom if a nation reneged.\n\nSubsequently, several states declared war on Germany in late August 1914, with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] declaring war on Austria-Hungary in 1915 and Germany on 27 August 1916; the United States on 6 April 1917 and [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] in July 1917.\n\n==Ottoman ally==\n{{Main|Ottoman entry into World War I}}\n[[File:Balkans attack Turkey in 1912, Danish cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|1912 Danish cartoon shows Balkan states tearing apart the rickety Ottoman Empire in [[First Balkan War]], October 1912]]\nTurkey had been badly defeated in a series of wars in the previous decade, losing the two [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912-13 and the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in 1911-12.<ref>R.

It would have projected German power toward Britain's sphere of influence (India and southern Persia), was resolved in June 1914.

The [[population density]] was 3,460.0 people per square mile (1,407.5/km\u00b2). There were 160 housing units at an average density of 1,580.0 per square mile (561.6/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the borough was 98.55% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.29 [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.29% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.29% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.58% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.45% of the population.\n\nThere were 139 households, out of which 32.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.0% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 16.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.2% were non-families. 25.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.58 and the average family size was 3.00.\n\nIn the borough the population was spread out, with 23.1% under the age of 18, 2.3% from 18 to 19, 4.9% from 20 to 24, 13.9% from 25 to 34, 21.4% from 35 to 49, 19.9% from 50-64, and 14.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. The population was 49.42% male, and 50.58% female.\n\n==History==\nThe year 1744 is the first record of [[Hartslog|John Hart's \u201clogg\u201d]], near where Alexandria is located now.   During the land purchase of 1755 James Sterrat of Carlisle purchased 400 acres including the sleeping place called John Hart's log on the [[Juniata River]], which is now Alexandria.\n\nSome time in the years before 1785 the first mention of a religious group called Hartslog Presbyterian Congregation was formed. A log worship house, [[Old Hartslog Church]], stood upon the hill one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) north of the present site of the town of Alexandria, where a burial ground was later made. This was a primitive structure but by 1787 a floor was laid, six large windows set in, a large door constructed, and a pulpit and a communion table made. In 1794 it was laid off into four sections, and fitted with pews. In 1826, the old Hartslog congregation moved to a brick building, referred to by Senator John Scott in his memoirs as the \"Brick Church\", which seems to have been located near to the site of the present Reformed Church. The old log worship house was taken down the same year, and some of its logs were used in one or two of the dwellings of Alexandria.\n\nIn the late 18th century the primary transportation to and from Alexandria was the [[Juniata River]], suitable only during summer and when the water depth permitted.  On May 3, 1808, the new road from Harrisburg to Alexandria opened, permitting a more reliable connection with the outside world.  In 1833 the [[Main Line of Public Works#Juniata Division Canal|Juniata Division]] of the [[Pennsylvania Canal]] was opened, the promise of better transportation started a mini housing boom in Alexandria.  By 1875 the canal was abandoned and the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] managed the transportation needs of the area.  Around this time the growth of the area slowed, while the populations of [[Huntingdon, Pennsylvania|Huntingdon]] and [[Hollidaysburg]] grew.\n<gallery mode=packed heights=190>\nAlexandria RR Station, Pennsylvania.jpg |Old railway station\n</gallery>\n\n==Hartslog Heritage Day Festival==\nAlexandria hosts the annual \"Hartslog Heritage Day\" celebration each year on the second Saturday of October. The day-long event recognizes the early days of the small borough, when, in 1744, a licensed Indian trader named John Hart used a large hollowed-out log to feed and salt his horses while he conducted his trading.\n\nEarly settlers used this log as a landmark to describe the location of their claims and referred to this area as Hartslog Settlement. In 1793 this area was laid out into town lots and named Alexandria, with the street near the site of the log name Hartslog Street.\n\nToday the name remains for Hartslog Street as well as the region \u2014 \"Hartslog Valley.\" There's also the Hartslog Grange, and of course, the festival, Hartslog Day. It's not your ordinary old fashioned heritage folk festival. It's much more than that, featuring music, crafts, games and lots of food, but you have to attend Hartslog Day to understand what makes this festival different from the rest.\n\nThe Hartslog Museum located on the second floor of the library in Alexandria is only open one weekend a month but it's always open for Hartslog Day.\n\nYou'll find the history of Huntingdon County and John Hart. If you're a history buff you'll find the Hartslog Museum a place of rare history. In particular, you'll find the history behind the Canal Basin, Indian tribes, Indian traders and [[John Scott (Pennsylvania)|John Scott]]. John was born and raised in Alexandria. He was the only man born in Alexandria and elected to the U.S. Senate.\n\nWhile visiting the museum you'll see many artifacts and antiques from this area and the era when Pennsylvania was still inhabited by Indian tribes. You'll also find many rare books and pictures.\n\nHartslog Day helps to support the museum.\n<gallery mode=packed heights=190>\nAlexandria PA Fire Department.jpg |Fire Department\nChrist Reformed Church of Alexandria PA.jpg|Christ Reformed Church\nOld hotel on Main Alexandria PA.jpg|Old hotel on Main Street\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable people==\n* Rev.

The federation was formed to represent and co-ordinate the affairs of local and regional miners' unions in England, Scotland and Wales whose associations remained largely autonomous. At its peak, the federation represented nearly one million workers.  It was reorganised into the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] in 1945.\n\n==Founding conference and membership==\nIn 1888 after colliery owners rejected a call for a pay rise from the [[Yorkshire Miners' Association]], several conferences were organised to discuss the possibility of forming a national union. At the conference held in the Temperance Hall in [[Newport, South Wales]] in November 1889, the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB) was formed.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=7}} [[Ben Pickard]] of the Yorkshire Miners' Association was elected president and [[Sam Woods]] of the [[Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation]] (LCMF) its vice-president.

This had been created in 1888 and covered Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, the Midland Counties, Lancashire and Cheshire, and North Wales.  In these districts, most output was used within the UK and, as a result, variations in international trade had less impact on them.<ref>''Dictionary of Labour Biography'', vol.II, pp.27-31</ref>  Their unions were opposed to payment of miners on a \"sliding scale\" based on the selling price of coal, a practice which was standard in South Wales, Northumberland and Durham.<ref name=\"griffin\">A. R. Griffin, ''Mining in the East Midlands 1550-1947'', pp.223-225</ref>  In recognition of this status, a single Conciliation Board was created for the Federated District.  The Federated District unions often worked together and opposed initiatives of the other MFGB affiliates.  In 1918, a majority of the MFGB decided instead to campaign for a single National Wages Board and this led to the break-up of the Federated District.  A. R. Griffin claimed that this \"...did incalculable harm to the miners of the Midlands without doing any good to anyone else\".<ref name=\"griffin\" />\n\nThe MFGB's membership increased by 30% in its first year and by 1890 its member federations had 250,000 members.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=7}} The [[Northumberland Miners' Association]] and the [[Durham Miners' Association]] initially refused to join but did so in 1907 and 1908.<ref name =\"NUM\"/>  Most of the MFGB's founding officials were still in control in 1910{{sfn|Page Arnot|1953|p=19}} by which time the membership was more than 600,000.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=15}} Membership peaked in 1920 when it had more than 945,000 members.

The government backed the colliery owners  and the TUC backed the miners. The government proposed setting up a commission and provided a subsidy to maintain wages at the July 1925 level.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=45}} The commission took no representations from the MFGB and the government built up coal supplies until the report was published in March 1926. The MFGB rejected the report's proposals and its general secretary [[A. J. Cook (trade unionist)|A. J. Cook]] coined the slogan, \"Not a penny off the pay, not a minute on the day!\".{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=46}} The colliery owners locked out more than one million miners, a \"state of emergency\" was declared and the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]] began in April 1926.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=46}} The strike lasted seven months. Despite support from many organisations including local communities, the Labour Party and financial support from workers in the USSR, the strikers were forced back to work in the November. The [[Nottinghamshire Miners' Association]] led by [[George Alfred Spencer|George Spencer]] broke away from the MFGB in early November after meeting local colliery owners and formed the rival Nottingham and District Miners' Industrial Union or \"Spencer\" union.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=53}}\n\nAfter the strike, the federation had lost public sympathy and the economic slump that followed affected miners' wages and working conditions. The MFGB's membership declined and by 1931 unemployment on the coalfields reached more than 40% and wages were poor for working miners.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=55}} [[Hunger marches]] in the 1930s highlighted the plight of mining communities. A disaster at [[Gresford disaster|Gresford Colliery]] demonstrated poor working conditions and breaches in the law by employers. A Royal Commission into mines' safety was started after the 1934 disaster but no new law was passed until the Mines and Quarries Act of 1954.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=57}} Fatalities in the mines had fallen in the years before 1926 but coal industry deaths rose to the 1900 level after the strike.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=59}}\n\nA ballot for a national strike in 1935 produced the largest majority vote in favour of industrial action. Wages in Nottinghamshire, where the breakaway \"Spencer\" union represented 80% of the workforce, were the lowest in the country. Men who remained loyal to the MFGB were victimised and colliery owners refused to recognise the federation.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=59}} Matters came to a head at [[Harworth Colliery]] in 1936. MFGB members demanding recognition struck for six months. Several officials and members were imprisoned and the breakaway union became even more isolated. The MFGB balloted its members about merging with the \"Spencer\" union but the proposal was rejected. The federation's leadership continued to negotiate until 1937 when the breakaway union returned to the MFGB but amid much bad feeling.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=60}}\n\nSupport for the mining industry to be nationalised grew between the wars and during [[World War II]]. At the onset of war the MFGB and government discussed how best to ensure a supply of coal for the war effort. The miners' position was that they wanted the industry to be nationalised at the end of hostilities.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=67}} In 1941 an Essential Work Order was imposed on the mines.<ref>{{citation |title= Labour shortage and the end of war |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/labour-shortage-end-war.htm |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] |accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref> In 1942 proposals to merge all districts and local associations into a single miners' union were drafted. After the Labour government was elected in 1945, the passing of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act meant all the industry's assets, rights and liabilities passed to the [[National Coal Board]] and the MFGB was reorganised into a single union, the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]].{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=67}}\n\n==Political affiliation==\n{{See also|Members of Parliament sponsored by mining unions}}\nThe miners' unions were the largest and most powerful industrial combinations in Britain for decades and exercised a great influence on the rest of the British labour movement. The first working class [[Member of Parliament|MPs]], [[Thomas Burt]] and [[Alexander Macdonald (Lib-Lab politician)|Alexander Macdonald]] were elected in 1874. They represented mining constituencies and were funded by miners' associations.  Elected as [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Liberal-Labour]] candidates, they supported by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].\n\nThe [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP), formed in 1893, was never very influential in the coalfields, but the Lib-Labs responded to its calls for independent labour candidatures by proposing that the federation would support any candidate put forward by a member union, regardless of political party.  When the proposal was adopted many unions put forward Liberal candidates, but the [[Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation]] was an early affiliate of the [[Labour Representation Committee (1900)|Labour Representation Committee]] (LRC), and the [[Scottish Miners' Federation]] was the principal backer of the [[Scottish Workers' Representation Committee]]. Other districts chose not to involve themselves in politics.<ref name=\"howell\">{{cite book|last1=Howell|first1=David|title=British Workers and the Independent Labour Party, 1888-1906|date=1983|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0719017912|pages=17&ndash;51}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1900s, many affiliates were frustrated with the Liberal Party's reluctance to adopt trade union candidates or take up trade union matters in Parliament.  In 1906, the MFGB held a national ballot on whether to affiliate to the LRC.  The proposal was defeated by 101,714 votes to 92,222. South Wales, Scotland, Yorkshire and Lancashire, the largest affiliates, were in favour of joining, but most smaller affiliates were strongly opposed.  After the close vote, the transformation of the LRC into the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and newly affiliated unions from Durham and Northumberland to the MFGB, a second ballot was held in 1908.  While the pattern of voting was similar, increased membership of the largest affiliates and stronger support among them, led to the earlier decision being overturned by 213,137 votes to 168,446.<ref name=\"howell\" />\n\nOn affiliation to Labour, MPs sponsored by member unions were asked to join the Labour Party group in parliament.  Many did, but a small number negotiated an exemption and remained Lib-Labs until 1918<ref name=\"howell\" /> causing ongoing disputes among members, but in 1918 the retirement of the remaining Lib-Labs and Labour's adoption of a programme championing nationalisation cemented the relationship.  [[Syndicalism]] had a short-lived popularity among members, but the defeat of the [[1926 UK general strike]] ended it as a significant force, and the MFGB leadership adopted a policy of strong support for the Labour Party leadership, putting great effort into securing parliamentary majorities for the party.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Andrew|title=Deadweight or bedrock?

At its peak, the federation represented nearly one million workers.  It was reorganised into the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] in 1945.\n\n==Founding conference and membership==\nIn 1888 after colliery owners rejected a call for a pay rise from the [[Yorkshire Miners' Association]], several conferences were organised to discuss the possibility of forming a national union.

This had been created in 1888 and covered Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, the Midland Counties, Lancashire and Cheshire, and North Wales.  In these districts, most output was used within the UK and, as a result, variations in international trade had less impact on them.<ref>''Dictionary of Labour Biography'', vol.II, pp.27-31</ref>  Their unions were opposed to payment of miners on a \"sliding scale\" based on the selling price of coal, a practice which was standard in South Wales, Northumberland and Durham.<ref name=\"griffin\">A. R. Griffin, ''Mining in the East Midlands 1550-1947'', pp.223-225</ref>  In recognition of this status, a single Conciliation Board was created for the Federated District.  The Federated District unions often worked together and opposed initiatives of the other MFGB affiliates.  In 1918, a majority of the MFGB decided instead to campaign for a single National Wages Board and this led to the break-up of the Federated District.  A. R. Griffin claimed that this \"...did incalculable harm to the miners of the Midlands without doing any good to anyone else\".<ref name=\"griffin\" />\n\nThe MFGB's membership increased by 30% in its first year and by 1890 its member federations had 250,000 members.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=7}} The [[Northumberland Miners' Association]] and the [[Durham Miners' Association]] initially refused to join but did so in 1907 and 1908.<ref name =\"NUM\"/>  Most of the MFGB's founding officials were still in control in 1910{{sfn|Page Arnot|1953|p=19}} by which time the membership was more than 600,000.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=15}} Membership peaked in 1920 when it had more than 945,000 members.

The demand led to the six-week-long [[National coal strike of 1912]] in which more than one million miners participated.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=17}}\n\nThe onset of [[World War I]] in 1914 led to calls for the repeal of the eight-hour day and increased productivity. South Wales miners struck in 1915 and increased pay was demanded in 1916 resulting in the coalfields being put into state control.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=27}} In 1914 the MFGB had joined with the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] (NUR) and the [[National Transport Workers' Federation]] (NTWF) in the [[Triple Alliance (1914)|Triple Alliance]].<ref name=\"BF\">{{citation |title= Black Friday and the TUC|url= http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/black-friday-tuc.htm  |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=1 October 2014 }}</ref> In 1919 the [[Coal Industry Commission Act 1919|Sankey Commission]] was set up to which the MFGB, colliery owners and government considered the future of the mining industry and two years later the government returned management of the collieries to their owners.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=27}} In 1921 a decision by the NUR and NTWF not to strike in sympathy with the miners is remembered as [[Black Friday (1921)|Black Friday]] and signalled the end of the alliance.<ref name=\"BF\"/>\n\n[[File:Tyldesley miners outside the Miners Hall during the 1926 General Strike.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Miners outside [[Tyldesley]] Miners Hall during the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]]]]\n\nPressure for wage cuts in 1925 plunged the MFGB into crisis. The government backed the colliery owners  and the TUC backed the miners. The government proposed setting up a commission and provided a subsidy to maintain wages at the July 1925 level.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=45}} The commission took no representations from the MFGB and the government built up coal supplies until the report was published in March 1926. The MFGB rejected the report's proposals and its general secretary [[A. J. Cook (trade unionist)|A. J. Cook]] coined the slogan, \"Not a penny off the pay, not a minute on the day!\".{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=46}} The colliery owners locked out more than one million miners, a \"state of emergency\" was declared and the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]] began in April 1926.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=46}} The strike lasted seven months. Despite support from many organisations including local communities, the Labour Party and financial support from workers in the USSR, the strikers were forced back to work in the November. The [[Nottinghamshire Miners' Association]] led by [[George Alfred Spencer|George Spencer]] broke away from the MFGB in early November after meeting local colliery owners and formed the rival Nottingham and District Miners' Industrial Union or \"Spencer\" union.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=53}}\n\nAfter the strike, the federation had lost public sympathy and the economic slump that followed affected miners' wages and working conditions. The MFGB's membership declined and by 1931 unemployment on the coalfields reached more than 40% and wages were poor for working miners.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=55}} [[Hunger marches]] in the 1930s highlighted the plight of mining communities. A disaster at [[Gresford disaster|Gresford Colliery]] demonstrated poor working conditions and breaches in the law by employers. A Royal Commission into mines' safety was started after the 1934 disaster but no new law was passed until the Mines and Quarries Act of 1954.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=57}} Fatalities in the mines had fallen in the years before 1926 but coal industry deaths rose to the 1900 level after the strike.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=59}}\n\nA ballot for a national strike in 1935 produced the largest majority vote in favour of industrial action. Wages in Nottinghamshire, where the breakaway \"Spencer\" union represented 80% of the workforce, were the lowest in the country. Men who remained loyal to the MFGB were victimised and colliery owners refused to recognise the federation.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=59}} Matters came to a head at [[Harworth Colliery]] in 1936. MFGB members demanding recognition struck for six months. Several officials and members were imprisoned and the breakaway union became even more isolated. The MFGB balloted its members about merging with the \"Spencer\" union but the proposal was rejected. The federation's leadership continued to negotiate until 1937 when the breakaway union returned to the MFGB but amid much bad feeling.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=60}}\n\nSupport for the mining industry to be nationalised grew between the wars and during [[World War II]]. At the onset of war the MFGB and government discussed how best to ensure a supply of coal for the war effort. The miners' position was that they wanted the industry to be nationalised at the end of hostilities.{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=67}} In 1941 an Essential Work Order was imposed on the mines.<ref>{{citation |title= Labour shortage and the end of war |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/labour-shortage-end-war.htm |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] |accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref> In 1942 proposals to merge all districts and local associations into a single miners' union were drafted. After the Labour government was elected in 1945, the passing of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act meant all the industry's assets, rights and liabilities passed to the [[National Coal Board]] and the MFGB was reorganised into a single union, the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]].{{sfn|National Union of Mineworkers|1989|p=67}}\n\n==Political affiliation==\n{{See also|Members of Parliament sponsored by mining unions}}\nThe miners' unions were the largest and most powerful industrial combinations in Britain for decades and exercised a great influence on the rest of the British labour movement. The first working class [[Member of Parliament|MPs]], [[Thomas Burt]] and [[Alexander Macdonald (Lib-Lab politician)|Alexander Macdonald]] were elected in 1874. They represented mining constituencies and were funded by miners' associations.  Elected as [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Liberal-Labour]] candidates, they supported by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].\n\nThe [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP), formed in 1893, was never very influential in the coalfields, but the Lib-Labs responded to its calls for independent labour candidatures by proposing that the federation would support any candidate put forward by a member union, regardless of political party.  When the proposal was adopted many unions put forward Liberal candidates, but the [[Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation]] was an early affiliate of the [[Labour Representation Committee (1900)|Labour Representation Committee]] (LRC), and the [[Scottish Miners' Federation]] was the principal backer of the [[Scottish Workers' Representation Committee]]. Other districts chose not to involve themselves in politics.<ref name=\"howell\">{{cite book|last1=Howell|first1=David|title=British Workers and the Independent Labour Party, 1888-1906|date=1983|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0719017912|pages=17&ndash;51}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1900s, many affiliates were frustrated with the Liberal Party's reluctance to adopt trade union candidates or take up trade union matters in Parliament.  In 1906, the MFGB held a national ballot on whether to affiliate to the LRC.  The proposal was defeated by 101,714 votes to 92,222. South Wales, Scotland, Yorkshire and Lancashire, the largest affiliates, were in favour of joining, but most smaller affiliates were strongly opposed.  After the close vote, the transformation of the LRC into the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and newly affiliated unions from Durham and Northumberland to the MFGB, a second ballot was held in 1908.  While the pattern of voting was similar, increased membership of the largest affiliates and stronger support among them, led to the earlier decision being overturned by 213,137 votes to 168,446.<ref name=\"howell\" />\n\nOn affiliation to Labour, MPs sponsored by member unions were asked to join the Labour Party group in parliament.  Many did, but a small number negotiated an exemption and remained Lib-Labs until 1918<ref name=\"howell\" /> causing ongoing disputes among members, but in 1918 the retirement of the remaining Lib-Labs and Labour's adoption of a programme championing nationalisation cemented the relationship.  [[Syndicalism]] had a short-lived popularity among members, but the defeat of the [[1926 UK general strike]] ended it as a significant force, and the MFGB leadership adopted a policy of strong support for the Labour Party leadership, putting great effort into securing parliamentary majorities for the party.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Andrew|title=Deadweight or bedrock?

It set up the Miners' Minority Movement, which saw initial success when activist [[A. J. Cook (trade unionist)|A. J. Cook]] was elected as the MFGB General Secretary, but a motion for the MFGB to affiliate to the communist [[Red International of Labour Unions]] attracted little support, and Cook later distanced himself from the communists.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Church|first1=Roy|last2=Outram|first2=Quentin|title=Strikes and Solidarity: Coalfield Conflict in Britain, 1889-1966|url=https://archive.org/details/strikessolidarit0000chur/page/62|url-access=registration|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521554608|pages=[https://archive.org/details/strikessolidarit0000chur/page/62 62&ndash;65]}}</ref>\n\n==Officers  of the federation==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
