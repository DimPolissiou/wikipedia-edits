Each installation contains five or so games that are designed to be played in large groups, including in conjunction with streaming services like [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] which provide a means for audiences to participate.\n\n==History==\nJellyvision had been well-established for their ''[[You Don't Know Jack (franchise)|You Don't Know Jack]]'' series of \"irreverent trivia\" games. While the series had been successful in the late 1990s, Jellyvision had not been able to make the transition easily from computer to home console games, and by 2001, all but six employees of Jellyvision had been let go. The company focused on developing business solution software, specifically offering software to its clients to help assist their customers for complex forms or other types of support.<ref name=\"adweek\">{{cite web | url = http://www.adweek.com/creativity/inside-the-rise-fall-and-triumphant-rebirth-of-a-beloved-chicago-game-studio/ | title = Inside the Rise, Fall and Triumphant Rebirth of a Beloved Chicago Game Studio | first = Dave | last=  Griner | date = June 16, 2017 | accessdate = October 2, 2017 | work = [[AdWeek]] }}</ref><ref name=\"chicagonow jellyvision\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/gamesmith/2011/02/part-of-jellyvisions-you-dont.html |title=Interview: Chicago's Jellyvision Speaks With GameSmith About New \"You Don't Know Jack\" Game |publisher=[[Chicago Now]] |date=February 9, 2011 |accessdate=February 16, 2011 |first=Ryan |last=Smith |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228165508/http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/gamesmith/2011/02/part-of-jellyvisions-you-dont.html |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy 2008, Jellyvision, now named The Jellyvision Lab, saw that [[mobile gaming]] was taking off, so split off a small subsidiary, Jellyvision Games, to rework ''You Don't Know Jack'', first for consoles in its [[You Don't Know Jack (2011 video game)|2011 version]], then for mobile and [[Facebook]] users with their now-defunct [[You Don't Know Jack (Facebook game)|2012 iteration]]. This last version was a critical success, and led to the studio to focus on developing similar games, rebranding the studio by 2013 as [[Jackbox Games]].<ref name=\"adweek\"/>\n\nAmong their one-off titles including ''Lie Swatter'', ''Clone Booth'', and ''Word Puttz'', generally designed as single player titles or played asynchronously with other players. One key game that followed this was their 2014 title ''Fibbage'', which was designed to be a game allowing eight players to play against each other simultaneously aided by the use of one of the players using live streaming of their game or with people in the same room. Other players would participate by using a web browser or mobile device to connect to the streaming player's game through Jackbox's servers and which to provide their answers.<ref name=\"adweek\"/>\n\nWith the success of ''Fibbage'', Jackbox Games decided that they could offer these games in packs, reworking older games to use the streaming capabilities and adding in new titles. This formed the basis of the ''Jackbox Party Pack'', with the first pack released in 2014 including updated versions of ''You Don't Know Jack'', ''Fibbage'', a reworked version of ''Lie Swatter'' for its multiplayer approach, and two new games. The company saw this as a new development model that allowed them to provide new packs on an annual basis, play around with different game formats, and provide higher value to consumers over one-off titles.<ref name=\"adweek\"/>\n\nSubsequent ''Jackbox Party Packs'' have included improvements of existing games, support for more players including the addition of audience participation through the same connectivity approach, better support for content management for streams (as to remove offensive terms in responses, for example), and the ability to create custom games. A key part of the games for the ''Party Packs'' was to streamline the ability for players to get into games, and according to Jackbox Games' CEO Mike Bilder, they spent about a year working on building their servers and software to provide a flexible architecture for the player-side mobile/web interface to expand for any of their games, and to avoid having players download any type of app to get started.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/jackbox-games-talks-you-don-t-know-jack-twitch-and-the-future-289137.phtml | title = Jackbox Games talks You Don't Know Jack, Twitch, and the future | first = Chris | last= Carter | date = March 17, 2015 | accessdate = October 4, 2017 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Allard Laban, creative chief for both Jellyvision Labs and Jackbox Games, they select games to include in the packs through a combination of allowing the team to submit fleshed-out ideas, and through testing various ideas through pen-and-paper trials; Laban stated that for the 4th pack, they had over fifty play-tested concepts which they narrowed down to four new games, rounding out the package with an improved version of ''Fibbage''.<ref name=\"adweek\"/> Some games, such as ''Fakin' It'', took multiple years to get the right gameplay and mechanics down to make it an appropriate game for inclusion.<ref name=\"adweek\"/>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Jackbox-party-party-quiplash.png|thumb|right|An example game screen, this from ''Quiplash 2'' in the 3rd pack. Two players' responses are shown and the other players (listed at the top of each reply) have voted for their favorite response. The game screen shows the \"room code\" to allow others to join in as audience members at any time.]]\nMost games in ''The Jackbox Party Pack'' are designed for online play, requiring only one person to own and launch the game. Remaining players can be local and thus see the game via the first player's computer or console, or can be remote, watching the game be played through streaming media services. All players \u2013 whether local or remote \u2013 use web-enabled devices, including personal computers and mobile or tablet devices, to enter a provided \"room code\" at Jackbox's dedicated servers to enter the game. Games are generally limited to around 8 active players, but any other players connecting to the room after these players are connected become audience participants, who can impact how scoring is determined and influence the winner.\n\nEach game generally has a period where all players are given a type of prompt. This prompt appears on the individual devices and gives players sufficient time to enter their reply or draw as necessary, and can be set to account for forced streaming delays that some streaming services require. The game then collects and processes all the replies, and frequently then gives players a chance to vote for the best answer or drawing; this is often where the audience may also participate by voting as a group. Games proceed for a number of rounds, and a winner, generally with the highest score at the end, is announced.\n\n==Games==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n|-\n|+ Platforms\n|-\n! ||PS3||PS4||Switch||Xbox One||PC/Mac||Apple TV/iPad||Android TV||Amazon Fire TV||Nvidia Shield TV||Xfinity X1\n|-\n!

Players score points in the form of money for answering correctly and in a shorter amount of time and lose money for wrong answers. Multiplayer games also feature \"screws,\" where one player can force another player to answer immediately and can earn a bonus if the \"screwed\" player answers incorrectly.  The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game.\n\n;''Drawful''\n:3-8 Players\n:''Drawful'' is a drawing game. Each round starts with each player individually given a playful phrase and a drawing canvas on their local device. They have a short amount of time to draw out that phrase. Following this, each picture is presented to all players, and the other players must enter a phrase they think the picture represents. Then, all those replies, along with the actual phrase for that picture, are presented to the players to make their vote of what they think the original phrase was. The artist of the picture gets points for every vote that guessed their original phrase, while those who wrote other phrases get points for votes their phrase gets.\n\n;''Word Spud''\n:2-8 Players\n:''Word Spud'' is a word association game. A word is presented and one player, at a time, comes up with a word that is associated with it. The remaining players vote if the association is good or not. From there, the next player starts from the new word to come up with a new association, and the game continues. The player with the most votes for their associations wins.\n\n;''Lie Swatter''\n:1-100 Players\n:A multiplayer version of the single-player mobile app that Jackbox Games released earlier, ''Lie Swatter'' challenges up to 100 players to correctly guess if presented trivia statements are true or not, \"swatting\" those that are false. Players earn points for correct answers and lose points for incorrect ones.\n\n;''Fibbage XL''\n:2-8 Players\n:''Fibbage XL'' expands on the original ''Fibbage'' with more potential questions. Each round of the game, a player selects from one of five random categories, and an obscure fact is presented to all players with a missing word or phrase to complete it. Each player uses their local device to enter a reply for those missing words; if they enter the actual right answer, they are asked to enter something different. Then, the game presents all replies, including the correct one, to the players, who then select what they think is the right answer. Players score points for selecting the right answer, but can also score if other players select their reply, so players are encouraged to provide seemingly correct answers for their replies. The player with the most points at the end of all rounds is the winner.\n\n=== ''The Jackbox Party Pack 2'' (2015) ===\n''The Jackbox Party Pack 2'' was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on October 13, 2015.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/review-jackbox-party-pack-2-315272.phtml | title = Review: Jackbox Party Pack 2 | first = Nic | last = Rowen | date = October 13, 2015 | accessdate = October 3, 2017 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> The [[Nintendo Switch]] version was released on August 17, 2017.<ref name=\"eg ns\"/>\n\n;''Fibbage 2''\n:2-8 Players\n:''Fibbage 2'' offers new sets of questions, and incorporates the ability for the audience to vote on answers which can provide an extra scoring boost to the players. A new option called the Defibrillator permit to players to delete all lies except one and the truth of the selection for one question.\n\n;''Earwax''\n:3-8 Players\n:''Earwax'' is played by 3-8 players. One player is selected as the judge and are given a choice of two categories. The category is presented to the other players, and these players are each given six random sound effects. Each player then selects two of the sound effects, in order, as a reply to the category. The judge player selects which combined sounds make the most humorous or fitting answer, and that selected player wins a point. The first player to three points wins the game.\n\n;''Bidiots''\n:3-6 Players\n:''Bidiots'' is described as a spiritual successor to ''Drawful'', playable by up to 6 people. At the start of the game, each player draws two simple pieces of art according to randomly selected categories, though these categories may be thematically related and result in similar visuals (for example, \"going to the beach\", \"getting a tan\", and \"sunburn\"). During the game, each player has a starting pool of in-game money which is used in an auction-style format to purchase the art. During the auction, each work is randomly assigned a secret monetary value based on the category, with those works drawn for that category having the highest value; the game will randomly send hints to players on the nature of this information. Players attempt to bid and purchase the art that matches the given category name while trying to use the auction format to goad other bidders to purchase the art they made in the wrong category. Players have \"screws\" as in ''You Don't Know Jack'' to force another player to bid, and if a player runs low on money, they can take out a predatory loan that will cost points at the end of the game. At the end of the game, the player with the most money, gained by buying low and selling high, wins.\n\n;''Quiplash XL''\n:3-8 Players\n:''Quiplash'' had been developed as a standalone game prior to the pack, and was included in this pack's release along with previous DLC (Quip Pack 1) and \"over 100 brand new prompts\". In the game's first two rounds, each player is given two prompts to provide an answer to; the prompts are given so that two players see each prompt. Players provide what they believe is a funny answer to each prompt. Then, all players are shown a prompt and the two answers provided. They vote for the answer they think is the best quip. Each vote gains points for the player that wrote the quip, with a possible \"quiplash\" and bonus points if they get all the votes. The final round, all players respond to the same prompt, and vote for the three best answers of those presented. The player with the most points at the end is the winner.\n\n;''Bomb Corp.''\n:1-4 Players\n:''Bomb Corp.'' has one player as an employee of a bomb factory that must deactivate inadvertently-started bombs as they come off the assembly lines, while other players are given different sets of instructions to help deactivate it. The instructions are specifically obtuse and potentially conflicting, requiring careful communication between players.\n\n=== ''The Jackbox Party Pack 3'' (2016) ===\n''The Jackbox Party Pack 3'' was released during the week of October 18, 2016 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], certain [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, and [[Apple TV]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-the-jackbox-party-pack-3-393240.phtml |title=Review: The Jackbox Party Pack 3 |first=Kevin |last=McKlusky |date=October 17, 2016 |accessdate=October 17, 2016 |work=[[Destructoid]]}}</ref> It was subsequently released on the [[Nintendo Switch]] on April 13, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/1/14479010/nintendo-switch-games-snake-pass-jackbox-party-pack-3 |title=Snake Pass and Jackbox Party Pack 3 coming to Nintendo Switch |first=Michael |last=McWhertor |date=February 1, 2017 |accessdate=February 1, 2017 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> A version for [[Xfinity]]'s X1 set-top box was available in January 2018.<ref name=\"xfinity\">{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/16/comcast-brings-jackbox-party-packs-to-x1/ | title = Comcast brings Jackbox's Party Packs to X1 set-top boxes | first = Mallory | last=  Locklear | date = January 16, 2018 | accessdate = January 16, 2018 | work = [[Engadget]] }}</ref>\n\n;''Quiplash 2''\n:3-8 Players\n:''Quiplash 2'' follows from the original ''Quiplash'', where each player attempts to complete a statement in a humorous way, and the other players vote the best answer. ''Quiplash 2'' introduces new prompts, the ability of the hosting player to create new prompts, the ability of the host to censor players, and new final rounds that either requires players to come up with the meaning of a given acronym, complete a caption in a comic strip, or come up with something clever using a given word in a prompt, unlike the previous game's final round, medals determine the points distributed to the players.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://jackboxgames.com/2016/06/so-yeah-were-making-quiplash-2-2/ |title=So, Yeah, We\u2019re Making Quiplash 2 |date=June 7, 2016 |website=Jackbox Games |language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n;''Trivia Murder Party''\n:1-8 Players\n:''Trivia Murder Party'' is played out in a lighthearted theme of a horror thriller (similar to the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' franchise]]). Each round includes a multiple-choice trivia question, with players earning in-game money for being correct, and then a subsequent mini-game if any \"living\" player got the question wrong. These mini-games take place on \"The Killing Floor\", where the loser (or multiple losers) of the mini-game are \"killed\" off and become ghosts. Ghosts still participate through the rest of the game. The mini-games range from random luck, challenges against themselves and the other players, or psychological games like a [[Prisoner's dilemma]] choice. The audience collectively plays as a ghost. \n:The game proceeds for at least 5 rounds, and no more than 10, until only one player remains alive; if more players are alive after 10 rounds, players subsequently spin the \"Loser Wheel\" which has a high chance of killing them, until only one player is left.\n:The last alive player then attempts to escape by moving across a set of spaces by correctly determining if two presented terms fit into a given category, moving one space for each correct answer. After the first turn, ghosts, including the audience, also begin to answer the same question, but have three terms instead of two, offering the possibility of catching up to the lead. If they surpass the leader, they possess that body, becoming the \"living\" player. Once the \"living\" player passes a final space, the game is over.\n\n;''Guesspionage''\n:2-8 Players\n:''Guesspionage'' has each player, in turn, guess what percentage of people have a certain quality or do a certain activity, such as texting while driving. If there are more than 5 audience members, they are surveyed prior to the turns to get these percentages, otherwise earlier survey results by Jackbox Games are used. Once the current player makes their guess, the other active players can consider if they are higher or lower than the actual value, including opining if they are off by more than a certain amount. Points are scored by the current player based on how close they are (providing that they are 30% or closer to the answer), and by the other players if they guessed correctly in which direction they were off.\n:In the final round, one question with 9 choices is given, and the players all have to pick what they think are three most popular answers, with points awarded based on the answer's popularity, the player with the most points after that wins.\n\n;''Fakin' It''\n:3-6 Players\n:''Fakin' It'' is a local multiplayer game where each player has their own connected device. In each round one player is randomly selected to be the Faker, and all players except the Faker are given instructions that involve some type of physical action, such as raising a hand or making a face; the Faker is not given this information but instead must figure out from the other players what to do. Each player then attempts to guess who the Faker by their actions, with the round ending if the Faker is guessed correctly by all other players, or successfully escaping, after which points are awarded for if at least one player guesses the Faker correctly, everyone guesses correctly, and/or if the Faker escapes capture in each task out of the number allotted (3 for 4-6 players, 2 for 3 players). After the first round, players may select any action they like.\n:The final round is always \"Text You Up\", where each player answers a number of open-ended questions, while the Faker is given different questions which can have overlapping answers with the questions given to the players (for example, the other players may be asked about a positive trait about themselves, while the Faker would be asked what traits they would look for in a companion.) The player with the most points by the end of the game wins.\n\n;''Tee K.O.''\n:3-8 Players\n:''Tee K.O.'' is a drawing-based game. Each player draws three images of anything they want, though the game provides suggestions to help. Then each player has a chance to enter several short sayings or slogan. Subsequently, each player is then given two or more random drawings and two or more random sayings, and selects the pair that best fits together as printed on a T-shirt. These designs are then put into a one-on-one voting battle with all other players and audience members as to determine the best-voted T-shirt design and the design that had the longest voting streak. A second round of drawing, slogan writing, pairing, and voting is performed. The winning designs from each round are then put against each other to determine the ultimate winning design. Players are able to have their designs printed to custom-print T-shirts if desired, the shirts cost $18 with free shipping in the United States.\n\n=== ''The Jackbox Party Pack 4'' (2017) ===\n''The Jackbox Party Pack 4'' was released during the week of October 17, 2017, for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Nintendo Switch]], various [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, and [[Apple TV]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2017/09/28/the-jackbox-party-pack-4-releases-in-under-three-weeks | title = The Jackbox Party Pack 4 Releases in Under Three Weeks | first=  Laura Kate | last = Dale | date = September 28, 2017 | accessdate = October 3, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}</ref> A version for [[Xfinity]]'s X1 set-top box was available in January 2018.<ref name=\"xfinity\"/>\n\n;''Fibbage 3''\n:2-8 Players\n:''Fibbage 3'' is the third game of the Fibbage series.

One player receives a question that asks their opinion on a topic. Their answer is taken out of context and sent to another player, who is then told to determine what the reply was in response to as if they were on a specific site, attempting to twist the words as best they can to make the first player look bad. All players are then presented with the pairs of original replies and the guessed topic, and vote on which pairing is the most ridiculous. Each vote earns points for the second player and a smaller number for the first player that provided the reply. The player with the most points at the end is the winner, having \"survived the Internet\".\n\n;''Monster Seeking Monster''\n:3-7 Players\n:''Monster Seeking Monster'' has a horror theme where each player is a disguised monster attempting to date other players. Each round, players start by sending up to four messages to other players; the audience, if participating, use [[Mad Libs|mad lib]]-style prompts to select phrases to send. Following this, each player then selects one other player they would date based on those replies. If two players selected each other, they both earn a heart. Additional scoring bonuses and effects due to the hidden monster power are also accounted for. From the second round on, the monster form of the leading player whose monster form is yet unknown, is revealed to all. The player with the most hearts at the end wins the game, unless other special conditions are met relating to the player's monster.\n\n;''Bracketeering''\n:3-16 Players\n:''Bracketeering'' is a tournament-style game for up to sixteen players, played across three rounds. In the first round, players are presented with a prompt to complete with the best or funniest answer they can. These answers are randomly placed on a tournament-style grid. The players are then given one of the tournament matchups and predict which answer will win that match up. Subsequently, each match is then presented to all players and the audience. The answer that gets the highest percentage of votes wins, with the percentage that it wins by tied to how many points those players that guessed that match correctly get. Subsequent match-ups use these best answers going forward. After the final matchup, the player that provided the winning reply gets an additional point bonus. The second round is a \"blind bracket\" where the players are presented with a prompt, but the brackets are based on a different, related prompt using those answers. The third round is a \"triple blind bracket\" where the prompt at each level of the bracket changes.\n\n;''Civic Doodle''\n:3-8 Players\n:''Civic Doodle'' is an art game similar to ''Drawful'' and ''Bidiots'' albeit with two players drawing the same piece of art simultaneously. In each round, a start of a doodle is presented to two randomly selected players, and they have a short time to draw atop that; this is done in real time allowing the audience members to provide feedback on either drawing in the form of preselected [[emoji]]. After the timer is done, the players and audience vote for which drawing is better, with points awarded to both players based on how many votes they received, as well as an additional bonus based on the emoji votes. Subsequently, two more players then draw atop the highest-voted picture.\n\n=== ''The Jackbox Party Pack 5'' (2018) ===\n''The Jackbox Party Pack 5'' was released on October 17, 2018.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/09/25/jackbox-party-pack-5-release-date-october-17/ | title=Jackbox Party Pack 5 restarts the party on October 17th | first = Alice | last =  O'Conner | date = September 25, 2018| accessdate = September 5, 2018 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/10/17/the-jackbox-party-pack-5-released/ | title = The Jackbox Party Pack 5 is now hanging out in the kitchen | first= Alice | last = O'Conner | date = October 17, 2018 | accessdate = October 17, 2018 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref>\n\n;''You Don't Know Jack: Full Stream''\n:1-8 Players\n:''You Don't Know Jack: Full Stream'' is the newest iteration of the series of the same name.

Each player is given a hypothetical scenario with a crucial element missing, and must fill in the blank.

The player who completed the situation then receives points based on how evenly the votes were split. The final round, known as the \"Decisive Dimension\", gives prompts with two options where the first is already completed. Players complete the second answer and everyone else picks the option. Points are awarded similarly to how they are in the main round, but players can earn extra points if they can predict what a certain player chooses beforehand. The style is reminiscent of 1950s TV shows like ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', featuring a muted color palette and mystery elements.\n\n;''Mad Verse City''\n:3-8 Players\n:''Mad Verse City'' has up to 8 players, as giant robots, trying to out-[[rap]] their opponents. In each round, players are given who they are trying to out-rap, and use their device to fill in various prompts given to them. The game then runs through each rap using a [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] voice, and players give points to the rap that they feel is the best.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/videos/2018/7/14/17566354/jackbox-party-pack-5-robot-rap-game-mad-verse-city| title = The Jackbox Party Pack 5\u2019s Mad Verse City is about robot rap battles | first = Clayton | last = Ashley | date = July 14, 2018 | accessdate = July 14, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\n;'''''Zeeple Dome'''''\n:1-6 Players\n:In ''Zeeple Dome'', up to six players play as contestants in an alien combat arena, the Zeeple Dome, to take down other aliens.

In each round, all players are given two fill-in-the-blank prompts that describe an everyday problem that may need solving. The problems are shuffled between players who solve them by drawing an invention with a title and a tagline. Players then pitch their invention, either by presenting it themselves in real life or by having the in-game hosts pitch it instead, and everyone funds the invention they like the most. If an invention surpasses the funding limit, the player who pitched the invention not only gets additional funding ($500 in round one and $1,000 in round two), but players who funded the invention get their funding back doubled (players who gave $800 to an invention get $1,600 back).

The assigned human players get one prompt, but the aliens get a different one that would likely cause some confusion. The results are shown, and players have the time to determine if any response seems suspicious. In later rounds, alien players have \"hacks\" they can use to either get the correct human prompt or send the alien prompt instead to a human player. At any time before the timer runs down, a player can \"push the button\" and select the other player(s) they believe are an alien. All other players then vote if they agree or not. In order for the players to be ejected, a unanimous vote must be passed. If any player votes \"No\", the game continues.

Each installation contains five or so games that are designed to be played in large groups, including in conjunction with streaming services like [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] which provide a means for audiences to participate.\n\n==History==\nJellyvision had been well-established for their ''[[You Don't Know Jack (franchise)|You Don't Know Jack]]'' series of \"irreverent trivia\" games. While the series had been successful in the late 1990s, Jellyvision had not been able to make the transition easily from computer to home console games, and by 2001, all but six employees of Jellyvision had been let go. The company focused on developing business solution software, specifically offering software to its clients to help assist their customers for complex forms or other types of support.<ref name=\"adweek\">{{cite web | url = http://www.adweek.com/creativity/inside-the-rise-fall-and-triumphant-rebirth-of-a-beloved-chicago-game-studio/ | title = Inside the Rise, Fall and Triumphant Rebirth of a Beloved Chicago Game Studio | first = Dave | last=  Griner | date = June 16, 2017 | accessdate = October 2, 2017 | work = [[AdWeek]] }}</ref><ref name=\"chicagonow jellyvision\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/gamesmith/2011/02/part-of-jellyvisions-you-dont.html |title=Interview: Chicago's Jellyvision Speaks With GameSmith About New \"You Don't Know Jack\" Game |publisher=[[Chicago Now]] |date=February 9, 2011 |accessdate=February 16, 2011 |first=Ryan |last=Smith |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228165508/http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/gamesmith/2011/02/part-of-jellyvisions-you-dont.html |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy 2008, Jellyvision, now named The Jellyvision Lab, saw that [[mobile gaming]] was taking off, so split off a small subsidiary, Jellyvision Games, to rework ''You Don't Know Jack'', first for consoles in its [[You Don't Know Jack (2011 video game)|2011 version]], then for mobile and [[Facebook]] users with their now-defunct [[You Don't Know Jack (Facebook game)|2012 iteration]]. This last version was a critical success, and led to the studio to focus on developing similar games, rebranding the studio by 2013 as [[Jackbox Games]].<ref name=\"adweek\"/>\n\nAmong their one-off titles including ''Lie Swatter'', ''Clone Booth'', and ''Word Puttz'', generally designed as single player titles or played asynchronously with other players. One key game that followed this was their 2014 title ''Fibbage'', which was designed to be a game allowing eight players to play against each other simultaneously aided by the use of one of the players using live streaming of their game or with people in the same room. Other players would participate by using a web browser or mobile device to connect to the streaming player's game through Jackbox's servers and which to provide their answers.<ref name=\"adweek\"/>\n\nWith the success of ''Fibbage'', Jackbox Games decided that they could offer these games in packs, reworking older games to use the streaming capabilities and adding in new titles. This formed the basis of the ''Jackbox Party Pack'', with the first pack released in 2014 including updated versions of ''You Don't Know Jack'', ''Fibbage'', a reworked version of ''Lie Swatter'' for its multiplayer approach, and two new games. The company saw this as a new development model that allowed them to provide new packs on an annual basis, play around with different game formats, and provide higher value to consumers over one-off titles.<ref name=\"adweek\"/>\n\nSubsequent ''Jackbox Party Packs'' have included improvements of existing games, support for more players including the addition of audience participation through the same connectivity approach, better support for content management for streams (as to remove offensive terms in responses, for example), and the ability to create custom games. A key part of the games for the ''Party Packs'' was to streamline the ability for players to get into games, and according to Jackbox Games' CEO Mike Bilder, they spent about a year working on building their servers and software to provide a flexible architecture for the player-side mobile/web interface to expand for any of their games, and to avoid having players download any type of app to get started.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/jackbox-games-talks-you-don-t-know-jack-twitch-and-the-future-289137.phtml | title = Jackbox Games talks You Don't Know Jack, Twitch, and the future | first = Chris | last= Carter | date = March 17, 2015 | accessdate = October 4, 2017 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Allard Laban, creative chief for both Jellyvision Labs and Jackbox Games, they select games to include in the packs through a combination of allowing the team to submit fleshed-out ideas, and through testing various ideas through pen-and-paper trials; Laban stated that for the 4th pack, they had over fifty play-tested concepts which they narrowed down to four new games, rounding out the package with an improved version of ''Fibbage''.<ref name=\"adweek\"/> Some games, such as ''Fakin' It'', took multiple years to get the right gameplay and mechanics down to make it an appropriate game for inclusion.<ref name=\"adweek\"/>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Jackbox-party-party-quiplash.png|thumb|right|An example game screen, this from ''Quiplash 2'' in the 3rd pack.

The game screen shows the \"room code\" to allow others to join in as audience members at any time.]]\nMost games in ''The Jackbox Party Pack'' are designed for online play, requiring only one person to own and launch the game. Remaining players can be local and thus see the game via the first player's computer or console, or can be remote, watching the game be played through streaming media services. All players \u2013 whether local or remote \u2013 use web-enabled devices, including personal computers and mobile or tablet devices, to enter a provided \"room code\" at Jackbox's dedicated servers to enter the game. Games are generally limited to around 8 active players, but any other players connecting to the room after these players are connected become audience participants, who can impact how scoring is determined and influence the winner.\n\nEach game generally has a period where all players are given a type of prompt. This prompt appears on the individual devices and gives players sufficient time to enter their reply or draw as necessary, and can be set to account for forced streaming delays that some streaming services require. The game then collects and processes all the replies, and frequently then gives players a chance to vote for the best answer or drawing; this is often where the audience may also participate by voting as a group. Games proceed for a number of rounds, and a winner, generally with the highest score at the end, is announced.\n\n==Games==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n|-\n|+ Platforms\n|-\n! ||PS3||PS4||Switch||Xbox One||PC/Mac||Apple TV/iPad||Android TV||Amazon Fire TV||Nvidia Shield TV||Xfinity X1\n|-\n!

Players score points in the form of money for answering correctly and in a shorter amount of time and lose money for wrong answers. Multiplayer games also feature \"screws,\" where one player can force another player to answer immediately and can earn a bonus if the \"screwed\" player answers incorrectly.  The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game.\n\n;''Drawful''\n:3-8 Players\n:''Drawful'' is a drawing game. Each round starts with each player individually given a playful phrase and a drawing canvas on their local device. They have a short amount of time to draw out that phrase. Following this, each picture is presented to all players, and the other players must enter a phrase they think the picture represents. Then, all those replies, along with the actual phrase for that picture, are presented to the players to make their vote of what they think the original phrase was. The artist of the picture gets points for every vote that guessed their original phrase, while those who wrote other phrases get points for votes their phrase gets.\n\n;''Word Spud''\n:2-8 Players\n:''Word Spud'' is a word association game. A word is presented and one player, at a time, comes up with a word that is associated with it. The remaining players vote if the association is good or not. From there, the next player starts from the new word to come up with a new association, and the game continues. The player with the most votes for their associations wins.\n\n;''Lie Swatter''\n:1-100 Players\n:A multiplayer version of the single-player mobile app that Jackbox Games released earlier, ''Lie Swatter'' challenges up to 100 players to correctly guess if presented trivia statements are true or not, \"swatting\" those that are false. Players earn points for correct answers and lose points for incorrect ones.\n\n;''Fibbage XL''\n:2-8 Players\n:''Fibbage XL'' expands on the original ''Fibbage'' with more potential questions. Each round of the game, a player selects from one of five random categories, and an obscure fact is presented to all players with a missing word or phrase to complete it. Each player uses their local device to enter a reply for those missing words; if they enter the actual right answer, they are asked to enter something different. Then, the game presents all replies, including the correct one, to the players, who then select what they think is the right answer. Players score points for selecting the right answer, but can also score if other players select their reply, so players are encouraged to provide seemingly correct answers for their replies. The player with the most points at the end of all rounds is the winner.\n\n=== ''The Jackbox Party Pack 2'' (2015) ===\n''The Jackbox Party Pack 2'' was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on October 13, 2015.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/review-jackbox-party-pack-2-315272.phtml | title = Review: Jackbox Party Pack 2 | first = Nic | last = Rowen | date = October 13, 2015 | accessdate = October 3, 2017 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> The [[Nintendo Switch]] version was released on August 17, 2017.<ref name=\"eg ns\"/>\n\n;''Fibbage 2''\n:2-8 Players\n:''Fibbage 2'' offers new sets of questions, and incorporates the ability for the audience to vote on answers which can provide an extra scoring boost to the players. A new option called the Defibrillator permit to players to delete all lies except one and the truth of the selection for one question.\n\n;''Earwax''\n:3-8 Players\n:''Earwax'' is played by 3-8 players. One player is selected as the judge and are given a choice of two categories. The category is presented to the other players, and these players are each given six random sound effects. Each player then selects two of the sound effects, in order, as a reply to the category. The judge player selects which combined sounds make the most humorous or fitting answer, and that selected player wins a point. The first player to three points wins the game.\n\n;''Bidiots''\n:3-6 Players\n:''Bidiots'' is described as a spiritual successor to ''Drawful'', playable by up to 6 people. At the start of the game, each player draws two simple pieces of art according to randomly selected categories, though these categories may be thematically related and result in similar visuals (for example, \"going to the beach\", \"getting a tan\", and \"sunburn\"). During the game, each player has a starting pool of in-game money which is used in an auction-style format to purchase the art. During the auction, each work is randomly assigned a secret monetary value based on the category, with those works drawn for that category having the highest value; the game will randomly send hints to players on the nature of this information. Players attempt to bid and purchase the art that matches the given category name while trying to use the auction format to goad other bidders to purchase the art they made in the wrong category. Players have \"screws\" as in ''You Don't Know Jack'' to force another player to bid, and if a player runs low on money, they can take out a predatory loan that will cost points at the end of the game. At the end of the game, the player with the most money, gained by buying low and selling high, wins.\n\n;''Quiplash XL''\n:3-8 Players\n:''Quiplash'' had been developed as a standalone game prior to the pack, and was included in this pack's release along with previous DLC (Quip Pack 1) and \"over 100 brand new prompts\". In the game's first two rounds, each player is given two prompts to provide an answer to; the prompts are given so that two players see each prompt. Players provide what they believe is a funny answer to each prompt. Then, all players are shown a prompt and the two answers provided. They vote for the answer they think is the best quip. Each vote gains points for the player that wrote the quip, with a possible \"quiplash\" and bonus points if they get all the votes. The final round, all players respond to the same prompt, and vote for the three best answers of those presented. The player with the most points at the end is the winner.\n\n;''Bomb Corp.''\n:1-4 Players\n:''Bomb Corp.'' has one player as an employee of a bomb factory that must deactivate inadvertently-started bombs as they come off the assembly lines, while other players are given different sets of instructions to help deactivate it.

''Quiplash 2'' introduces new prompts, the ability of the hosting player to create new prompts, the ability of the host to censor players, and new final rounds that either requires players to come up with the meaning of a given acronym, complete a caption in a comic strip, or come up with something clever using a given word in a prompt, unlike the previous game's final round, medals determine the points distributed to the players.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://jackboxgames.com/2016/06/so-yeah-were-making-quiplash-2-2/ |title=So, Yeah, We\u2019re Making Quiplash 2 |date=June 7, 2016 |website=Jackbox Games |language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n;''Trivia Murder Party''\n:1-8 Players\n:''Trivia Murder Party'' is played out in a lighthearted theme of a horror thriller (similar to the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' franchise]]). Each round includes a multiple-choice trivia question, with players earning in-game money for being correct, and then a subsequent mini-game if any \"living\" player got the question wrong. These mini-games take place on \"The Killing Floor\", where the loser (or multiple losers) of the mini-game are \"killed\" off and become ghosts. Ghosts still participate through the rest of the game. The mini-games range from random luck, challenges against themselves and the other players, or psychological games like a [[Prisoner's dilemma]] choice. The audience collectively plays as a ghost. \n:The game proceeds for at least 5 rounds, and no more than 10, until only one player remains alive; if more players are alive after 10 rounds, players subsequently spin the \"Loser Wheel\" which has a high chance of killing them, until only one player is left.\n:The last alive player then attempts to escape by moving across a set of spaces by correctly determining if two presented terms fit into a given category, moving one space for each correct answer. After the first turn, ghosts, including the audience, also begin to answer the same question, but have three terms instead of two, offering the possibility of catching up to the lead. If they surpass the leader, they possess that body, becoming the \"living\" player. Once the \"living\" player passes a final space, the game is over.\n\n;''Guesspionage''\n:2-8 Players\n:''Guesspionage'' has each player, in turn, guess what percentage of people have a certain quality or do a certain activity, such as texting while driving. If there are more than 5 audience members, they are surveyed prior to the turns to get these percentages, otherwise earlier survey results by Jackbox Games are used. Once the current player makes their guess, the other active players can consider if they are higher or lower than the actual value, including opining if they are off by more than a certain amount. Points are scored by the current player based on how close they are (providing that they are 30% or closer to the answer), and by the other players if they guessed correctly in which direction they were off.\n:In the final round, one question with 9 choices is given, and the players all have to pick what they think are three most popular answers, with points awarded based on the answer's popularity, the player with the most points after that wins.\n\n;''Fakin' It''\n:3-6 Players\n:''Fakin' It'' is a local multiplayer game where each player has their own connected device. In each round one player is randomly selected to be the Faker, and all players except the Faker are given instructions that involve some type of physical action, such as raising a hand or making a face; the Faker is not given this information but instead must figure out from the other players what to do. Each player then attempts to guess who the Faker by their actions, with the round ending if the Faker is guessed correctly by all other players, or successfully escaping, after which points are awarded for if at least one player guesses the Faker correctly, everyone guesses correctly, and/or if the Faker escapes capture in each task out of the number allotted (3 for 4-6 players, 2 for 3 players). After the first round, players may select any action they like.\n:The final round is always \"Text You Up\", where each player answers a number of open-ended questions, while the Faker is given different questions which can have overlapping answers with the questions given to the players (for example, the other players may be asked about a positive trait about themselves, while the Faker would be asked what traits they would look for in a companion.) The player with the most points by the end of the game wins.\n\n;''Tee K.O.''\n:3-8 Players\n:''Tee K.O.'' is a drawing-based game. Each player draws three images of anything they want, though the game provides suggestions to help. Then each player has a chance to enter several short sayings or slogan. Subsequently, each player is then given two or more random drawings and two or more random sayings, and selects the pair that best fits together as printed on a T-shirt. These designs are then put into a one-on-one voting battle with all other players and audience members as to determine the best-voted T-shirt design and the design that had the longest voting streak. A second round of drawing, slogan writing, pairing, and voting is performed. The winning designs from each round are then put against each other to determine the ultimate winning design. Players are able to have their designs printed to custom-print T-shirts if desired, the shirts cost $18 with free shipping in the United States.\n\n=== ''The Jackbox Party Pack 4'' (2017) ===\n''The Jackbox Party Pack 4'' was released during the week of October 17, 2017, for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Nintendo Switch]], various [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, and [[Apple TV]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2017/09/28/the-jackbox-party-pack-4-releases-in-under-three-weeks | title = The Jackbox Party Pack 4 Releases in Under Three Weeks | first=  Laura Kate | last = Dale | date = September 28, 2017 | accessdate = October 3, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}</ref> A version for [[Xfinity]]'s X1 set-top box was available in January 2018.<ref name=\"xfinity\"/>\n\n;''Fibbage 3''\n:2-8 Players\n:''Fibbage 3'' is the third game of the Fibbage series.

One player receives a question that asks their opinion on a topic. Their answer is taken out of context and sent to another player, who is then told to determine what the reply was in response to as if they were on a specific site, attempting to twist the words as best they can to make the first player look bad. All players are then presented with the pairs of original replies and the guessed topic, and vote on which pairing is the most ridiculous. Each vote earns points for the second player and a smaller number for the first player that provided the reply. The player with the most points at the end is the winner, having \"survived the Internet\".\n\n;''Monster Seeking Monster''\n:3-7 Players\n:''Monster Seeking Monster'' has a horror theme where each player is a disguised monster attempting to date other players. Each round, players start by sending up to four messages to other players; the audience, if participating, use [[Mad Libs|mad lib]]-style prompts to select phrases to send. Following this, each player then selects one other player they would date based on those replies. If two players selected each other, they both earn a heart. Additional scoring bonuses and effects due to the hidden monster power are also accounted for. From the second round on, the monster form of the leading player whose monster form is yet unknown, is revealed to all. The player with the most hearts at the end wins the game, unless other special conditions are met relating to the player's monster.\n\n;''Bracketeering''\n:3-16 Players\n:''Bracketeering'' is a tournament-style game for up to sixteen players, played across three rounds. In the first round, players are presented with a prompt to complete with the best or funniest answer they can. These answers are randomly placed on a tournament-style grid. The players are then given one of the tournament matchups and predict which answer will win that match up. Subsequently, each match is then presented to all players and the audience. The answer that gets the highest percentage of votes wins, with the percentage that it wins by tied to how many points those players that guessed that match correctly get. Subsequent match-ups use these best answers going forward. After the final matchup, the player that provided the winning reply gets an additional point bonus. The second round is a \"blind bracket\" where the players are presented with a prompt, but the brackets are based on a different, related prompt using those answers. The third round is a \"triple blind bracket\" where the prompt at each level of the bracket changes.\n\n;''Civic Doodle''\n:3-8 Players\n:''Civic Doodle'' is an art game similar to ''Drawful'' and ''Bidiots'' albeit with two players drawing the same piece of art simultaneously. In each round, a start of a doodle is presented to two randomly selected players, and they have a short time to draw atop that; this is done in real time allowing the audience members to provide feedback on either drawing in the form of preselected [[emoji]]. After the timer is done, the players and audience vote for which drawing is better, with points awarded to both players based on how many votes they received, as well as an additional bonus based on the emoji votes. Subsequently, two more players then draw atop the highest-voted picture.\n\n=== ''The Jackbox Party Pack 5'' (2018) ===\n''The Jackbox Party Pack 5'' was released on October 17, 2018.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/09/25/jackbox-party-pack-5-release-date-october-17/ | title=Jackbox Party Pack 5 restarts the party on October 17th | first = Alice | last =  O'Conner | date = September 25, 2018| accessdate = September 5, 2018 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/10/17/the-jackbox-party-pack-5-released/ | title = The Jackbox Party Pack 5 is now hanging out in the kitchen | first= Alice | last = O'Conner | date = October 17, 2018 | accessdate = October 17, 2018 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref>\n\n;''You Don't Know Jack: Full Stream''\n:1-8 Players\n:''You Don't Know Jack: Full Stream'' is the newest iteration of the series of the same name. The game is updated to feature similar streaming-friendly features as most other Party Pack games. This includes support for up to eight players and an audience. As the game now uses both mobile devices and computers as a controller, the text-based questions like the ''Gibberish Question'' return, new and classic question types are present.\n\n;''Split the Room''\n:3-8 Players\n:''Split the Room'' is a game hosted by an omnipresent cat, creating hypothetical situations. Each player is given a hypothetical scenario with a crucial element missing, and must fill in the blank. Then the situation is presented to the rest of the players, who must decide whether they answer 'yes' or 'no'. The player who completed the situation then receives points based on how evenly the votes were split. The final round, known as the \"Decisive Dimension\", gives prompts with two options where the first is already completed. Players complete the second answer and everyone else picks the option. Points are awarded similarly to how they are in the main round, but players can earn extra points if they can predict what a certain player chooses beforehand. The style is reminiscent of 1950s TV shows like ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', featuring a muted color palette and mystery elements.\n\n;''Mad Verse City''\n:3-8 Players\n:''Mad Verse City'' has up to 8 players, as giant robots, trying to out-[[rap]] their opponents. In each round, players are given who they are trying to out-rap, and use their device to fill in various prompts given to them.

The problems are shuffled between players who solve them by drawing an invention with a title and a tagline. Players then pitch their invention, either by presenting it themselves in real life or by having the in-game hosts pitch it instead, and everyone funds the invention they like the most. If an invention surpasses the funding limit, the player who pitched the invention not only gets additional funding ($500 in round one and $1,000 in round two), but players who funded the invention get their funding back doubled (players who gave $800 to an invention get $1,600 back).

It debuted at number one on [[the New York Times bestseller list]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The New York Times bestseller list for September 3, 1989 |url=http://www.hawes.com/1989/1989-09-03.pdf |accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref> A [[Clear and Present Danger (film)|film adaptation]], featuring [[Harrison Ford]] reprising his role as Ryan, was released on August 3, 1994.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe [[President of the United States]], who is running for reelection, finds a fierce opponent in [[Ohio]] Governor J. Robert Fowler, who has rallied the American public behind his administration's failures in the [[War on Drugs]]. This provides [[National Security Advisor]] James Cutter with an opportunity to help him initiate covert operations within [[Colombia]] with intent to disrupt the [[illegal drug trade]] there. Aided by [[CIA]] Deputy Director (Operations) Robert Ritter and CIA director Arthur Moore, the plan involves inserting [[light infantry]] troops of Hispanic descent into the country to stake out airstrips used by the cartel (SHOWBOAT), which then allows [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15 Eagles]] to intercept drug flights (EAGLE EYE). In addition, mobile phone communications between cartel management are intercepted through CAPER, which is also the communications arm for SHOWBOAT.\n\nMeanwhile, a [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|U.S. Coast Guard cutter]] ''Panache'' intercepts a yacht in the [[Caribbean Sea]]; its crew finds two Hispanic men cleaning up the vessel after murdering its owner and his family. Through a mock trial and execution, the Coast Guardsmen force the killers to confess to their crimes; it is later learned that the murdered owner was a businessman involved in a [[money laundering]] scheme for a Colombian drug cartel. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) then proceeds to seize the laundered money from several banks in the United States and Europe, which amounted to over $650 million. \n\nThe seizure of the cartel money by the FBI infuriates drug cartel leader Ernesto Escobedo, who had ordered the hit on the American businessman. Meanwhile, his intelligence officer Felix Cortez finds out about FBI director Emil Jacobs's official visit to the [[Attorney General of Colombia]], and as a result, Escobedo orders the assassination of Jacobs without informing Cortez. Upon arriving in the city of [[Bogot\u00e1]], the FBI director's motorcade was ambushed, killing him as well as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] head and the U.S. ambassador to Colombia. Enraged, the President authorizes Operation RECIPROCITY, stepping up Cutter's operations and declaring war on Escobedo's drug organization.\n\nLater, a surgical airstrike on a drug kingpin's mansion during a meeting of several cartel members kills everyone inside; however, Escobedo did not attend the meeting and sends Cortez, who was delayed and witnessed the explosion as a result. Cortez later deduces that the Americans have been conducting operations against the Colombian drug cartel, but plays along, planning to engineer a war within the cartel that will leave him in a position to seize power.

A sequel to ''[[The Cardinal of the Kremlin]]'' (1988), main character [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]] becomes acting Deputy Director of Intelligence in the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], and discovers that he is being kept in the dark by his colleagues who are conducting a [[covert war]] against a [[drug cartel]] based in [[Colombia]]. It debuted at number one on [[the New York Times bestseller list]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The New York Times bestseller list for September 3, 1989 |url=http://www.hawes.com/1989/1989-09-03.pdf |accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref> A [[Clear and Present Danger (film)|film adaptation]], featuring [[Harrison Ford]] reprising his role as Ryan, was released on August 3, 1994.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe [[President of the United States]], who is running for reelection, finds a fierce opponent in [[Ohio]] Governor J. Robert Fowler, who has rallied the American public behind his administration's failures in the [[War on Drugs]]. This provides [[National Security Advisor]] James Cutter with an opportunity to help him initiate covert operations within [[Colombia]] with intent to disrupt the [[illegal drug trade]] there. Aided by [[CIA]] Deputy Director (Operations) Robert Ritter and CIA director Arthur Moore, the plan involves inserting [[light infantry]] troops of Hispanic descent into the country to stake out airstrips used by the cartel (SHOWBOAT), which then allows [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15 Eagles]] to intercept drug flights (EAGLE EYE). In addition, mobile phone communications between cartel management are intercepted through CAPER, which is also the communications arm for SHOWBOAT.\n\nMeanwhile, a [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|U.S. Coast Guard cutter]] ''Panache'' intercepts a yacht in the [[Caribbean Sea]]; its crew finds two Hispanic men cleaning up the vessel after murdering its owner and his family. Through a mock trial and execution, the Coast Guardsmen force the killers to confess to their crimes; it is later learned that the murdered owner was a businessman involved in a [[money laundering]] scheme for a Colombian drug cartel. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) then proceeds to seize the laundered money from several banks in the United States and Europe, which amounted to over $650 million. \n\nThe seizure of the cartel money by the FBI infuriates drug cartel leader Ernesto Escobedo, who had ordered the hit on the American businessman. Meanwhile, his intelligence officer Felix Cortez finds out about FBI director Emil Jacobs's official visit to the [[Attorney General of Colombia]], and as a result, Escobedo orders the assassination of Jacobs without informing Cortez. Upon arriving in the city of [[Bogot\u00e1]], the FBI director's motorcade was ambushed, killing him as well as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] head and the U.S. ambassador to Colombia. Enraged, the President authorizes Operation RECIPROCITY, stepping up Cutter's operations and declaring war on Escobedo's drug organization.\n\nLater, a surgical airstrike on a drug kingpin's mansion during a meeting of several cartel members kills everyone inside; however, Escobedo did not attend the meeting and sends Cortez, who was delayed and witnessed the explosion as a result. Cortez later deduces that the Americans have been conducting operations against the Colombian drug cartel, but plays along, planning to engineer a war within the cartel that will leave him in a position to seize power. He dispatches mercenaries to hunt down the American troops, and later blackmails Cutter in a secret meeting into shutting down all covert operations against the cartel in exchange for slowing down drug imports to the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]], [[United States Marine Corps|former Marine]] and the acting CIA Deputy Director (Intelligence) after his boss James Greer was hospitalized for [[pancreatic cancer]], suspects the agency's involvement in the situation in Colombia. His position enables him to be aware of most operations, but he realizes he is being kept out of the loop. After his friend, fighter pilot Robby Jackson, makes an inquiry into activity in the region, Ryan becomes determined to find out what is going on, eventually finding out about the covert operations from breaking into Ritter's files in his office. Outraged, he seeks help from the FBI and later meets [[John Clark (Tom Clancy character)|John Clark]], a CIA operative and [[United States Navy SEALs|former Navy SEAL]] coordinating CAPER.\n\nHaving been previously ordered by the President to shut down all covert operations against the cartel to avoid the political fallout, Cutter does so after his secret meeting with Cortez, and then secretly provides the latter with the coordinates of the American troops in Colombia for him to hunt down. Their meeting having been shadowed by the FBI, Ryan and Clark become outraged; they later team up to rescue American troops left behind in Colombia via an [[U.S. Air Force]] helicopter, missing Greer's funeral. Although they suffer casualties from encountering mercenaries employed by the cartel along the way, they successfully extract the survivors \u2014 one of them being Staff Sergeant Domingo \"Ding\" Chavez \u2014 and later capture Cortez and Escobedo (the latter of whom is handed over to his cartel enemies) in a raid on the cartel's command post.\n\nCortez is later returned to [[Cuba]], where he is branded as a traitor by his former colleagues. Upon being confronted by Clark with evidence of his treason, Cutter commits suicide. Ryan confronts the defiant President for not informing him about the covert operations in Colombia; after he briefs the committee, the President deliberately loses the election to Fowler, in order to hide the operations and protect the honor of those involved.

It talks about the abuse of political and military power, and addresses the dangers of a government bureaucracy where no one can be held accountable for actions implied to be illegal by a democratic society. The book was released around the time of the [[Iran-Contra affair]], which strikingly bears many parallels with the novel. Additionally, it pushes the narrative that the [[War on Drugs]], which was also a major issue during the time of the book's publication, is corrupting law enforcement, and that the status quo is enforced in this struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberg |first1=Martin H. |title=The Tom Clancy Companion |pages=20\u201323 |edition=Revised}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Commercial===\nThe book debuted at number one on [[the New York Times bestseller list]], and has stayed on the chart for several years as well as its paperback edition.<ref>{{cite web |title=PAPERBACK BEST SELLERS; July 22, 1990 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/22/books/paperback-best-sellers-july-22-1990.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=15 August 2018}}</ref> It became the best-selling novel of the 1980s, selling 1,625,544 hardcover copies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/25thann/bestsellers.htm |title=Top Hardcover Bestsellers, 1972-1996 |work=Washington Post |date=June 1, 1997 |accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Critical===\nThe book received wide critical acclaim.

It was the initial post-colonial [[United States territory|Territory of the United States]] and encompassed most of pre-war British [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|colonial territory]] west of the [[Appalachian mountains]] north of the [[Ohio River]]. It included all the land west of [[Pennsylvania]], northwest of the [[Ohio River]] and east of the [[Mississippi River]] below the [[Great Lakes]]. It spanned all or large parts of six eventual [[U.S. State]]s ([[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]], and the northeastern part of [[Minnesota]]).  It was created as a Territory by the [[Northwest Ordinance]] July 13, 1787, reduced to Ohio, eastern Michigan and a sliver of southeastern Indiana with the formation of [[Indiana Territory]] July 4, 1800, and ceased to exist March 1, 1803, when the southeastern portion of the territory was admitted to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[Ohio|state of Ohio]], and the remainder attached to [[Indiana Territory]].\n\nAt its inception the Territory was a vast wilderness sparsely populated by Indians including the [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Potawatomi]], [[Shawnee]] and others; there were only a handful of French colonial settlements, and Clarksville at Falls of the Ohio. At the territory's dissolution, there were dozens of towns and settlements, a few with thousands of settlers, mostly in Ohio chiefly along the Ohio and Miami Rivers and around the Great Lakes.\n\nThe region was ceded to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris of 1783]].\nThe [[Congress of the Confederation]] enacted the [[Northwest Ordinance]] in 1787 to provide for the administration of the territories and set rules for admission of jurisdictions as states. On August 7, 1789, the new [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] affirmed the Ordinance with slight modifications under the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]].\n\nInitially, the Territory was governed by martial law under a governor and three judges, but as population increased, a legislature, the Territorial General Assembly, was formed. Administratively, the Territory was divided into a succession of counties, eventually totaling 13.\n\nConflicts between settlers and Native American inhabitants of the Territory resulted in the [[Northwest Indian War]] culminating in General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]]'s victory at [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794. The subsequent [[Treaty of Greenville]] 1795 opened the way for settlement of southern and western Ohio.\n\n==The territory==\nThe Northwest Territory included all the then-owned land of the United States west of [[Pennsylvania]], east of the [[Mississippi River]], and northwest of the [[Ohio River]]. It incorporated most of the former [[Ohio Country]] except a portion in western Pennsylvania, and eastern [[Illinois Country]]. It covered all of the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, as well as the northeastern part of Minnesota. Lands west of the Mississippi River were the [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana Province]] of New France (acquired by the United States in 1803 by the [[Louisiana Purchase]]); lands north of the [[Great Lakes]] were the British [[Province of Upper Canada]], and lands south of the Ohio River constituted [[Kentucky County, Virginia]], admitted to the union as the state of [[Kentucky]] in 1792. The area included more than {{convert|260000|mi2}} and comprised about 1/3 of the land area of the United States at the time of its creation. It was inhabited by about 45,000 Native Americans and 4,000 traders, mostly [[Canadien]] and British. Among the tribes inhabiting the region were the Shawnee, Delaware, Miami, Wyandot, Ottawa and Potawatomi. Notably, the Miami capital along with British trading posts was at Kekionga at the site of present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Neutralizing Kekionga became the focus of the Northwest Indian War, the driving events in the early evolution of the territory.\n[[File:United States land claims and cessions 1782-1802.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|The state cessions that eventually allowed for the creation of the territories north and southwest of the [[River Ohio]]]]\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2015}}\nIntegration of the Northwest Territory into a political unit, and settlement, depended on three factors: relinquishment by the British, extinguishment  of states' claims west of the Appalachians, and usurpation or purchase of lands from the Indians.  These objectives were accomplished correspondingly by the [[American Revolutionary War]], provisions in the [[Articles of Confederation]], and various treaties preceding the [[Northwest Indian War]] including [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)]] and [[Treaty of Fort McIntosh]] (1785).  The treaty process would extend well beyond the War and existence of the Territory as a political entity.\n\n===New France===\n{{Further|Beaver Wars}}\nEuropean exploration of the region began with [[French-Canadian]] voyageurs in the 17th century, followed by French missionaries and French fur traders. French-Canadian explorer [[Jean Nicolet]] was the first recorded European entrant into the region, landing in 1634 at the current site of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] (although [[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] is stated by some sources as having explored [[Lake Superior]] and possibly inland Wisconsin in 1622). The French exercised control from widely separate posts in the region, which they claimed as [[New France]]; among these was the post at [[Fort Detroit]], founded in 1701. France ceded the territory to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] as part of the [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]] in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]], after being defeated in the [[French and Indian War]].\n\n===British control===\n{{See also|Illinois campaign}}\nFrom the 1750s to the peace treaty that ended the War of 1812, the British had a long-standing goal of creating an [[Indian barrier state]], a large \"neutral\" Indian state that would cover most of the Old Northwest. It would be independent of the United States and under the tutelage of the British, who would use it to block American expansion and to build up their control of the [[fur trade]] headquartered in Montreal.<ref>Dwight L. Smith, \"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea,\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 61#2\u20134 (1989): 46\u201363.</ref>\n\nA new colony, named [[Charlotina]], was proposed for the southern Great Lakes region. However, facing [[Pontiac's Rebellion|armed opposition]] by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], the British issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|Proclamation of 1763]], which prohibited [[White American|white]] colonial settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. This action angered American colonists interested in expansion, as well as those who had already settled in the area. In 1774, by the [[Quebec Act]], Britain annexed the region to the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] in order to provide a civil government and to centralize British administration of the Montreal-based fur trade. The prohibition of settlement west of the Appalachians remained, contributing to the [[American Revolution]].\n\nIn February 1779, [[George Rogers Clark]] of the [[Virginia Militia]] [[Illinois campaign|captured Kaskaskia and Vincennes]] from British commander [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]]. Virginia capitalized on Clark's success by laying claim to the whole of the Old Northwest, calling it [[Illinois County]], Virginia,<ref>Palmer, pp. 400\u2013421.{{full citation needed|date= December 2013}}</ref> until 1784, when Virginia ceded its land claims to the federal government.\n\nBritain officially ceded the area north of the Ohio River and west of the Appalachians to the United States at the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]] with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], but the British continued to maintain a presence in the region as late as 1815, the end of the [[War of 1812]].\n\n===Cessions by the states===\n{{main|State cessions}}\nSeveral states (Virginia, Massachusetts, New York, and Connecticut) had competing claims on the territory: Virginia claimed all of what were formerly Illinois Country and Ohio Country; Massachusetts claimed what are today southern Michigan and Wisconsin; Connecticut claimed a narrow strip across the territory just south of the Great Lakes; New York claimed an elastic portion of Iroquis lands between Lake Erie and the Ohio River. The western boundary of Pennsylvania was also ill-defined. Virginia's jurisdiction was limited to a few French settlements at the extreme western edge of the territory. Massachusett's and Connecticut's claims were effectively lines on paper. New York had no colonial settlements or territorial government in the claimed lands.\n\nThe western border of Pennsylvania, previously assumed to run in a north by northeast zigzag, was resolved in 1780 by the Continental Congress. The Mason\u2013Dixon line was extended westward to a point five degrees of longitude (about 260 miles) from the Delaware River and the western boundary extended to run due north from the western-most extent of the Mason\u2013Dixon line to the 43rd parallel. This incorporated the eastern part of Ohio Country as western Pennsylvania, and set the eastern boundary of federal lands.\n\n\"Unlanded\" states, such as Maryland, refused to ratify the [[Articles of Confederation]] so long as these states were allowed to keep their western territory, fearing that those states could continue to grow and tip the balance of power in their favor under the proposed system of federal government. As a concession to obtain ratification, these states ceded their claims on the territory to the federal government: New York in 1780, Virginia in 1784, and Massachusetts and Connecticut in 1785. So the majority of the territory became public land owned by the U.S. government. Virginia and Connecticut reserved two areas to use as compensation to military veterans: The [[Virginia Military District]]<ref>Virginia ceded to the United States its claim to undeeded land in the VMC on Dec. 8, 1852. In 1871, Congress ceded this land to the state.</ref> and the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]]<ref>In 1800, Connecticut ceded its Western Reserve claims to the Northwest Territory, and it came under the sovereignty of Ohio in 1803.</ref>\n\nThomas Jefferson's [[Land Ordinance of 1784]] was the first organization of the territory by the United States; it provided a process for dividing the territory into individual states.  The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established a [[Public Land Survey System|standardized system for surveying the land]] into saleable lots, although Ohio would be partially surveyed several times using different methods, resulting in a patchwork of land surveys in Ohio. Some older French communities' property claims based on earlier systems of long, narrow lots also were retained. The rest of the Northwest Territory was divided into roughly uniform square townships and sections, which facilitated land sales and development. The ordinance also stipulated that the territory would eventually form at least three but not more than five new states.<ref>{{cite book |last=Calloway |first=Colin G. |year=2015 |title=The Victory with No Name. The Native American Defeat of the First American Army |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=50}}</ref>\n\n===Founding of the territory===\nUnder the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, which created the Northwest Territory, General St. Clair was appointed governor. When the territory was divided in 1800, he briefly served as governor of the Northwest Territory remnant that included Ohio, the eastern half of Michigan, and a sliver of southeastern Indiana called \"The Gore.\"\n\nSt. Clair formally established the government on July 15, 1788, at [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]]. In 1790, he renamed the settlement of Losantiville [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], after the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], and moved the administrative and military center to [[Fort Washington (Ohio)|Fort Washington]].\n\nAs Governor, he formulated the [[Maxwell's Code]] (named after its printer, [[William Maxwell (engraver)|William Maxwell]]), the first written criminal and civil laws of the territory. Maxwell's Code consisted of thirty-seven different laws with the stipulation that the laws had to have been passed previously in one of the original thirteen states. The laws restructured the court system then in effect in the Northwest Territory. They also protected residents against excessive taxes and declared that English common law would be the basis of legal decisions and laws in the Northwest Territory.\n\n[[File:ST.CLAIR, Arthur (signed check).jpg|thumb|Check signed by [[Arthur St. Clair]] while governor of the Northwest Territory (1796)]]\n\n===Northwest Indian War===\n{{Main|Northwest Indian War}}\n{{Further|Western Confederacy|Harmar Campaign|Big Bottom massacre|St. Clair's Defeat|Legion of the United States|Siege of Fort Recovery|Battle of Fallen Timbers|Treaty of Greenville}}\nThe young United States government, deeply in debt following the Revolutionary War and lacking authority to tax under the [[Articles of Confederation]], planned to raise revenue from the methodical sale of land in the Northwest Territory. This plan necessarily called for the removal of both Native American villages and squatters from lands west of Appalachia, loosely, the territory called \"Ohio Country\" and beyond.<ref>{{cite book |last=Calloway |first=Colin G. |year=2015 |title=The Victory with No Name.

In 1789, he succeeded in getting certain Indians to sign the [[Treaty of Fort Harmar]], but many native leaders had not been invited to participate in the negotiations or had refused to do so. Rather than settling the Indians' claims, the treaty provoked an escalation of the  \"[[Northwest Indian War]]\" (or \"Little Turtle's War\"). Mutual hostilities led to a campaign by General [[Josiah Harmar]], whose 1,500 militiamen were [[Harmar Campaign|defeated]] by the Indians in October 1790.<ref>Michael S. Warner, \"General Josiah Harmar's Campaign Reconsidered: How the Americans Lost the Battle of Kekionga.\" ''Indiana Magazine of History'' (1987): 43\u201364.

He led a [[punitive expedition]] involving two Regular Army regiments and some militia. In October 1791 as an advance post for his campaign, [[Fort Jefferson (Ohio)]], was built under his direction. Located in present-day [[Darke County]] in far western Ohio, the fort was built of wood and intended primarily as a supply depot; accordingly, it was originally named Fort Deposit. One month later, near modern-day [[Fort Recovery]], his force advanced to the location of Indian settlements near the headwaters of the [[Wabash River]], but on November 4 they were routed in battle by a tribal confederation led by [[Miami tribe|Miami]] Chief [[Little Turtle]] and Shawnee chief [[Blue Jacket]]. More than 600 soldiers and scores of women and children were killed in the battle, known as \"[[St. Clair's Defeat]]\" and many other names. It remains the greatest defeat of a US Army by Native Americans in history, with about 623 American soldiers killed in action and about 50 Native American killed. Although an investigation exonerated him, St. Clair resigned his army commission in March 1792 at the request of President Washington, but continued to serve as Governor of the Northwest Territory.<ref>Leroy V.

Wayne was commissioned to form a new army of 5120 professional soldiers, dubbed the \"Legion of the United States\". Wayne recruited and trained his army in Pennsylvania, and moved them to southwestern Ohio in fall of 1793. There they were joined by the Kentucky Militia under Major General [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]]. Over the next ten months, the armies marched north up the Great Miami and Maumee River valleys toward the Miami capital of Kekionga. Along the way Wayne's legion built a series of outpost forts including Fort Greene Ville, Fort Recovery and Fort Defiance. Fierce battles occurred around some of these but none of Wayne's forts were ever taken by the Indians. \n{{missing info|siege of Fort Recovery summer 1794|date=January 2019}}\nIn mid 1794, the British built [[Fort Miami (Ohio)|Fort Miamis]] near what is today Toledo, Ohio, to forestall Wayne's putative advance on the British stronghold at Detroit. The final battle of Wayne's campaign occurred within the scope of this fort. The military campaign of Gen. Wayne against the Western Confederacy, who were supported by a British company, culminated with victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794. Following the battle, in fall 1794, Wayne's army marched unopposed to Kekionga where they constructed Fort Wayne, a defiant symbol of U.S. sovereignty in the heart of Indian Country.\n\n[[Jay's Treaty]], in 1794, temporarily helped to smooth relations with British traders in the region, where British citizens outnumbered American citizens throughout the 1790s. The following year, the [[Treaty of Greenville]] secured peace on the western frontier and opened most of southern and eastern Ohio for settlement.\n\n===Settlement===\n{{Further|Vincennes Tract|Clark's Grant|Symmes Purchase|Ohio Company|Connecticut Land Company|Purchase on the Muskingum|Seven Ranges}}\n\nSporadic westward emigrant settlements had already resumed late in the war{{which|date=December 2018}} after the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]'s power was broken and the tribes scattered by the 1779 [[Sullivan Expedition]]. Soon after the Revolution ended, land-hungry migrants started moving west. A gateway trading post developed as the town of [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]], which was a key outfitting center west of the mountains. Other wagon roads, such as the [[Kittanning Path]] surmounting the [[gaps of the Allegheny]] in central Pennsylvania, or trails along the [[Mohawk River]] in New York, enabled a steady stream of settlers to reach the near west and the lands bordering the Mississippi.{{efn|Before the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]], the western border of U.S. territory ended on the Mississippi; the lands beyond still being a possession of Napoleonic France or the [[Kingdom of Spain]].}} This activity stimulated the development of the eastern parts of the eventual [[National Road]] by private investors. The [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland&ndash;Brownsville]] toll road linked the water routes of the [[Potomac River]] with the [[Monongahela River]] of the Ohio/Mississippi riverine systems in the days when water travel was the only good alternative to walking and riding. Most of the territory and its successors was settled by emigrants passing through the [[Cumberland Narrows]], or along the [[Mohawk Valley region|Mohawk Valley]] in New York State.\n\nThe Continental Congress' title to the lands north of the Ohio River was derived from the Treaty of Paris (1783), the Treaty of Fort McIntosh, and the cessions of four states.  Settlement was through several means: squatters, direct U.S. government land sales to settlers, sales of tracts of land to land companies, and state sales of land to veterans in the Virginia Military District and Connecticut Western Reserve.  The first area to be surveyed was the [[Seven Ranges]] along the eastern border of Ohio in 1786\u20131789.  Direct sales of federal lands to individual homesteaders started here.  In some cases, the government granted or donated land for special purposes.\n\nSettlement followed the forts, whether garrisoned or not.  Lack of a garrison meant that threat of Indian attack had become negligible.  This was true everywhere in Ohio before 1800 except the northwest sector above the Greenville Treaty line. It became true in Indiana after the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811; by 1813 Battle of the Thames where Tecumseh was defeated and killed, the frontier had essentially moved to west of the Mississippi.  The first U.S. military garrisons in the territory were Fort Patrick Henry, Vincennes, Indiana (1779), Fort Clark at Falls of the Ohio, Indiana (1783), and Fort Harmar in Ohio (1785).  The first settlements were at these locations.\n\nThe [[Clark's Grant|first land grant]] was to George Rogers Clark in 1781 at Falls of the Ohio on the Indiana side; he went on to found the settlement of Clarksville. The first two land purchases were large tracts of land sold to John Symmes ([[Symmes Purchase]]) in 1788 and two tracts sold to Ohio Company in 1787 and 1792 ([[Purchase on the Muskingum]]). Settlement of these areas was spearheaded by Losantiville and Marietta, respectively. In 1792, Congress [[Donation Tract|donated 100,000 acres]] to Ohio Company as a buffer zone against Indian incursion around the settled area. The vexing land claims by inhabitants of the old French Vincennes Tract were finally resolved by what was dubbed the 'Vincennes donation lands' embodied in a federal land act of 1791. Federal land sales in Indiana (then a part of Indiana Territory starting in 1800) didn't begin until 1801, through the Cincinnati land office.\n\nAccording to the 1800 Census of the United States, the Northwest Territory (i.e. the pending state of Ohio) had a population, excluding Indians, of over 45,000, and Indiana Territory, a population of about 5,600.  By the time of Ohio statehood, there were as many as 50 named towns in Northwest and Indiana Territories, a few, like Vincennes, with thousands of settlers, and dozens of unnamed settlements below the Treaty Line in Ohio.\n\nFollowing settlement of the frontier, the great wave of colonial immigration flowed westward, founding the great cities of the eventual 6 states of the Territory which is now the midwestern United States  early in the 19th century: Detroit (<1800), Columbus (1812), Indianapolis (1822),  Chicago (1833), Milwaukee (1846), Minneapolis (1847).\n\n===Statehood for Ohio===\nA [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]], St. Clair hoped to see two states made of the Ohio Territory to increase Federalist power in [[United States Congress|Congress]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} However, he was resented by Ohio Democratic-Republicans for what was perceived as his partisanship, high-handedness and arrogance in office.  In 1802, his opposition to plans for Ohio statehood led President [[Thomas Jefferson]] to remove him from office as territorial governor.  He thus played no part in the organizing of the state of [[Ohio]] in 1803.  The first [[Ohio Constitution]] provided for a weak governor and a strong [[legislature]], in part a reaction to St. Clair's method of governance.\n\nOn July 4, 1800, in preparation for Ohio's statehood, the [[Indiana Territory]] was decreed by an act of the U.S. Congress,<ref>An ACT to divide the territory of the United States north-west of the Ohio, into two separate governments</ref> signed into law by [[John Adams|President John Adams]] on May 7, 1800, effective on July 4. The Congressional legislation encompassed all land west of the present Indiana\u2013Ohio border and its northward extension to [[Lake Superior]], reducing the Northwest Territory to present-day Ohio and the eastern half of Michigan's [[Lower Peninsula]]. The [[Enabling Act of 1802]] authorized creation of the state of Ohio from the remainder of the Northwest Territory. Ohio was admitted as the 17th state on March 1, 1803. A few days later, the residual land was annexed to [[Indiana Territory]], and the Northwest Territory went out of existence. Ongoing disputes with the British over the region were a contributing factor to the War of 1812. Britain irrevocably ceded claim to the former Northwest Territory with the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1814.\n\n{{Further|Indiana Territory|History of Ohio}}\n\n==Northwest Ordinance==\n{{Main|Northwest Ordinance}}\n\nThe Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established the Northwest Territory, and defined its boundaries, form of government, and administrative structure.  In particular, it defined the bodies of government, established the legal basis of land ownership, provided for abolition and transfer of state territorial claims, made rules for admission of new states, established public education, recognized and codified 'natural rights', prohibited slavery, and defined the land rights and applicability of laws to the Indians.\n\n===Law and government===\n[[File:United States 1789-08-1790-04.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Map of the states and territories of the United States as it was on August 7, 1789, when the Northwest Territory was first organized, to April 2, 1790, when the future [[Southwest Territory]] was ceded by North Carolina]]\nAt first, the [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] had a modified form of [[martial law]]. The governor was also the senior army [[Commissioned officer|officer]] within the territory, and he combined [[legislative]] and [[executive branch|executive authority]]. But a [[supreme court]] was established, and he shared legislative powers with the [[court]]. County governments were organized as soon as the population was sufficient, and these assumed local [[Public administration|administrative]] and [[judicial]] functions. [[Washington County, Ohio|Washington County]] was the first of these, at [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]] in 1788. This was an important event, as this court was the first establishment of civil and criminal law in the pioneer country.\n\nAs soon as the number of free male [[settler]]s exceeded 5,000, the territorial legislature was to be created, and this happened in 1798. The full mechanisms of government were put in place, as outlined in the [[Northwest Ordinance]]. A [[bicameral legislature]] consisted of a [[State legislature (United States)|House of Representatives]] and a Council. The first House had 22 [[Legislator|representatives]], apportioned by population of each county.<ref name=ohio1917>{{cite book |title= Manual of Legislative Practice in the General Assembly |author= Ohio General Assembly |page= 199 |year= 1917 |publisher= State of Ohio |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7qesAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA199|author-link= Ohio General Assembly }}</ref> The House then nominated 10 citizens to be Council members. The nominations were sent to the U.S. Congress, which appointed five of them as the Council. This assembly became the legislature of the Territory, although the governor retained veto power.\n\nArticle VI of the Articles of Compact within the Northwest Ordinance prohibited the owning of [[History of slavery in the United States|slaves]] within the Northwest Territory. However, territorial governments evaded this law by use of indenture laws.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.statelib.lib.in.us/www/ihb/publications/terrslavery.html  |publisher= Indiana Historical Bureau |title= Slavery in Indiana Territory |accessdate= July 24, 2013 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070721043832/http://www.statelib.lib.in.us/www/ihb/publications/terrslavery.html |archivedate=July 21, 2007 }}</ref> The Articles of Compact prohibited legal discrimination on the basis of religion within the territory.\n\nThe [[Township (United States)|township]] formula created by [[Thomas Jefferson]] was first implemented in the Northwest Territory through the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]]. The square surveys of the Northwest Territory would become a hallmark of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], as [[Section (U.S. land surveying)|section]]s, townships, counties (and states) were laid out scientifically, and land was sold quickly and efficiently (although not without some speculative aberrations).\n\n====Officials====\n[[Arthur St. Clair]] was the territory's governor until November 1802, when President [[Thomas Jefferson]] removed him from office and appointed [[Charles Willing Byrd]], who served the position until Ohio became a state and elected its first governor, [[Edward Tiffin]], on March 3, 1803.<ref>{{Cite journal |url= http://publications.ohiohistory.org/ohstemplate.cfm?action=detail&Page=0041237.html&StartPage=237&EndPage=240&volume=41&newtitle=Volume%2041%20Page%20237 |first= W.

The first session of the Assembly was held in September 1799. Its first important task was to select a non-voting [[United States congressional delegations from Northwest Territory|delegate to the U.S. Congress]]. Locked in a power struggle with Governor St. Clair, the legislature narrowly elected William Henry Harrison as the first delegate over the governor's son, Arthur St. Clair, Jr. Subsequent congressional delegates were [[William McMillan (congressman)|William McMillan]] (1800\u20131801) and [[Paul Fearing]] (1801\u20131803).\n\n===Land ownership===\nThe Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established the concept of [[fee simple]] ownership, by which ownership was in perpetuity with unlimited power to sell or give it away.\n\n===Prohibition of slavery===\nThe ordinance was the first of its kind in prohibiting slavery in a U.S. state or territory, but a fugitive slave clause allowed slave owners in other states to reclaim runaway slaves.\n\n===Indian lands===\nIn regards to the [[Delaware]] Native Americans living in the region, Congress decided, on July 27, 1787, that 10,000 acres on the [[Muskingum River]] in the present state of Ohio would \"be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the [[Moravian Brethren]] . . . or a society of the said Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web |title= Religion and the Congress of the Confederation, 1774\u201389 |url= https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html |publisher= Library of Congress |accessdate= November 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\n\nThe [[Northwest Ordinance]] called for a public university for the education, settlement and eventual statehood of the [[Ohio Country|frontier of Ohio and beyond]].  Article 3 stated, \"Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\" \nThe [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] created an innovation in public education when it reserved resources for local public schools.  The ordinance divided the territory into 36 mile<sup>2</sup> townships, and each township was further divided into 36 one mile<sup>2</sup> tracts for purposes of sale.  The ordinance then stated that \"there shall be reserved from sale the lot No. 16 of every township for the maintenance of public schools within the said township.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Knight |first=George Wells |title=History, and Management of Land Grants for Education in the Northwest Territory (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin) |year=1885 |publisher=G.

Most forts were military garrisons only. Early settlements were outside or nearby forts: Clarksville, Vincennes, Kaskaskia (French), Losantiville, and the Ohio Company settlements at Marietta and Waterford/Beverly. Later, after the Treaty of Greenville, settlements no longer needed to be spearheaded by forts, and sprang up everywhere simultaneously below the Treaty Line. There were dozens of unnamed settlements in addition to these. Michigan forts and settlements belonged to the British until 1796; Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota were wilderness and Indian lands.\n\n[[File:USPostRoadMap1796.jpg|right|thumb|[[Abraham Bradley Jr.|Abraham Bradley's]] 1796 map of the United States includes many forts and settlements within the Northwest Territory.]]\n*[[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia]], Illinois, 1778\n*Fort Gage/[[Kaskaskia, Illinois]], 1779, an American/French settlement\n*[[Fort Patrick Henry]]/Vincennes, Indiana 1779\n*[[Fort Nelson (Kentucky)|Fort Nelson]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Falls of the Ohio]], 1781\n*[[Clarksville, Indiana]], 1783 (Louisville, KY, also grew out of this settlement)\n*[[Fort Finney (Ohio)|Fort Finney]], Ohio, 1785, moved to Fort Finney, Indiana, 1786\n*[[Fort Harmar]], Ohio, 1785\n*[[Fort Finney (Indiana)|Fort Finney]]/Jeffersonville, Indiana, 1786\n*[[Fort Steuben]], Ohio, January 1787, abandoned May 1787\n*[[Marietta, Ohio]], July 1788\n*[[Columbia-Tusculum, Cincinnati|Columbia, Ohio]], November 1788\n*Losantiville ([[Cincinnati]]), Ohio, December 1788\n*[[North Bend, Ohio]], February 1789\n*[[Waterford, Ohio|Waterford]] and [[Beverly, Ohio|Beverly]], Ohio, spring 1789\n*[[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]], Ohio, summer 1789 (later, Newport Barracks, Louisville, Kentucky)\n*[[Manchester, Ohio|Massie's Station]], Virginia Military District, 1790, renamed Manchester\n*Fort Dilles, Ohio, 1790, later called [[Dilles Bottom, Ohio|Dilles Bottom]]\n*[[Gallipolis]], Ohio, October 1790\n*[[Stockport, Ohio|Big Bottom]], Ohio, December 1790 (squatter settlement, site of [[Big Bottom Massacre]] in 1791)\n*[[Fort Frye]], Ohio, January\u2013February 1791 (not a U.S. military garrison)\n*[[Hamilton, Ohio#History|Fort Hamilton]], Ohio, September 1791\n*[[Fort Jefferson (Ohio)|Fort Jefferson]], Ohio, October 1791  (originally Fort Deposit)\n*[[Fort St. Clair]], Ohio, 1792\n*[[Fort Greene Ville]], Ohio, November 1793\n*[[Fort Recovery]], Ohio, December 1793 \u2013 March 1794\n*[[Fort Adams (Ohio)|Fort Adams]], Ohio, August 1794\n*[[Fort Massac]], Illinois, June \u2013 October 1794\n*[[Fort Defiance (Ohio)|Fort Defiance]], Ohio, August 1794\n(Battle of Fallen Timbers, August 1794)\n*Fort Deposit, Ohio, September \u2013 October 1794\n*[[Fort Wayne (fort)|Fort Wayne]], Indiana, October 1794\n*[[Fort Loramie, Ohio#History|Fort Loramie]] (or Laramie), Ohio, winter 1794\u201395\n*[[Piqua, Ohio#History|Fort Piqua]], Ohio, winter 1794\u201395\n*Fort St. Mary's, Ohio, October 1795\n*Jefferson, 1795, now [[Martins Ferry, Ohio|Martins Ferry]]\n*[[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]], Ohio, 1796\n*[[Cleveland]], Connecticut Western Reserve, 1796\n*[[Fort Miami (Ohio)|Fort Miami]], Ohio, ceded to U.S. 1796\n*[[Fort Lernoult]] (previously [[Fort Detroit]]), Michigan, ceded to U.S. 1796\n*[[Fort Mackinac]], Michigan, ceded to U.S. 1796\n*[[Williamsburg, Ohio]], 1796\n*[[Dayton, Ohio]], 1796\n*Newellstown, Ohio, 1796, renamed [[St. Clairsville, Ohio|St. Clairsville]]\n*[[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]] Ohio, 1797\n*[[Athens, Ohio|Athens]], Ohio, 1797\n*[[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]], Ohio, 1797\n*[[Warren, Ohio]], 1798\n*[[Bethel, Ohio]], 1798\n*[[Zanesville, Ohio]], 1799\n*[[Lancaster, Ohio]], 1800\n*[[Springfield, Ohio]], 1801\n*[[Youngstown, Ohio]], 1802\n*[[Coshocton, Ohio]], 1802\n*[[Lawrenceburg, Indiana]], 1802 (the Gore, part of Ohio until 1803)\n*New Lisbon, Ohio, 1803, later renamed [[Lisbon, Ohio|Lisbon]]\n*[[Xenia, Ohio]], 1803\n*[[Mentor, Ohio]], after 1800\nSettlements in states other than Ohio after 1800 are part of the History of Indiana Territory.\n\n==Territorial counties==\n[[File:MELIOREM LAPSA LOCAVIT.JPG|thumb|Seal of the Northwest Territory over a time capsule outside the [[Campus Martius Museum]].

It was the initial post-colonial [[United States territory|Territory of the United States]] and encompassed most of pre-war British [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|colonial territory]] west of the [[Appalachian mountains]] north of the [[Ohio River]]. It included all the land west of [[Pennsylvania]], northwest of the [[Ohio River]] and east of the [[Mississippi River]] below the [[Great Lakes]]. It spanned all or large parts of six eventual [[U.S. State]]s ([[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]], and the northeastern part of [[Minnesota]]).  It was created as a Territory by the [[Northwest Ordinance]] July 13, 1787, reduced to Ohio, eastern Michigan and a sliver of southeastern Indiana with the formation of [[Indiana Territory]] July 4, 1800, and ceased to exist March 1, 1803, when the southeastern portion of the territory was admitted to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[Ohio|state of Ohio]], and the remainder attached to [[Indiana Territory]].\n\nAt its inception the Territory was a vast wilderness sparsely populated by Indians including the [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Potawatomi]], [[Shawnee]] and others; there were only a handful of French colonial settlements, and Clarksville at Falls of the Ohio. At the territory's dissolution, there were dozens of towns and settlements, a few with thousands of settlers, mostly in Ohio chiefly along the Ohio and Miami Rivers and around the Great Lakes.\n\nThe region was ceded to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris of 1783]].\nThe [[Congress of the Confederation]] enacted the [[Northwest Ordinance]] in 1787 to provide for the administration of the territories and set rules for admission of jurisdictions as states. On August 7, 1789, the new [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] affirmed the Ordinance with slight modifications under the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]].\n\nInitially, the Territory was governed by martial law under a governor and three judges, but as population increased, a legislature, the Territorial General Assembly, was formed. Administratively, the Territory was divided into a succession of counties, eventually totaling 13.\n\nConflicts between settlers and Native American inhabitants of the Territory resulted in the [[Northwest Indian War]] culminating in General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]]'s victory at [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794. The subsequent [[Treaty of Greenville]] 1795 opened the way for settlement of southern and western Ohio.\n\n==The territory==\nThe Northwest Territory included all the then-owned land of the United States west of [[Pennsylvania]], east of the [[Mississippi River]], and northwest of the [[Ohio River]]. It incorporated most of the former [[Ohio Country]] except a portion in western Pennsylvania, and eastern [[Illinois Country]]. It covered all of the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, as well as the northeastern part of Minnesota. Lands west of the Mississippi River were the [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana Province]] of New France (acquired by the United States in 1803 by the [[Louisiana Purchase]]); lands north of the [[Great Lakes]] were the British [[Province of Upper Canada]], and lands south of the Ohio River constituted [[Kentucky County, Virginia]], admitted to the union as the state of [[Kentucky]] in 1792. The area included more than {{convert|260000|mi2}} and comprised about 1/3 of the land area of the United States at the time of its creation. It was inhabited by about 45,000 Native Americans and 4,000 traders, mostly [[Canadien]] and British. Among the tribes inhabiting the region were the Shawnee, Delaware, Miami, Wyandot, Ottawa and Potawatomi. Notably, the Miami capital along with British trading posts was at Kekionga at the site of present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Neutralizing Kekionga became the focus of the Northwest Indian War, the driving events in the early evolution of the territory.\n[[File:United States land claims and cessions 1782-1802.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|The state cessions that eventually allowed for the creation of the territories north and southwest of the [[River Ohio]]]]\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2015}}\nIntegration of the Northwest Territory into a political unit, and settlement, depended on three factors: relinquishment by the British, extinguishment  of states' claims west of the Appalachians, and usurpation or purchase of lands from the Indians.  These objectives were accomplished correspondingly by the [[American Revolutionary War]], provisions in the [[Articles of Confederation]], and various treaties preceding the [[Northwest Indian War]] including [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)]] and [[Treaty of Fort McIntosh]] (1785).  The treaty process would extend well beyond the War and existence of the Territory as a political entity.\n\n===New France===\n{{Further|Beaver Wars}}\nEuropean exploration of the region began with [[French-Canadian]] voyageurs in the 17th century, followed by French missionaries and French fur traders. French-Canadian explorer [[Jean Nicolet]] was the first recorded European entrant into the region, landing in 1634 at the current site of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] (although [[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] is stated by some sources as having explored [[Lake Superior]] and possibly inland Wisconsin in 1622). The French exercised control from widely separate posts in the region, which they claimed as [[New France]]; among these was the post at [[Fort Detroit]], founded in 1701. France ceded the territory to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] as part of the [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]] in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]], after being defeated in the [[French and Indian War]].\n\n===British control===\n{{See also|Illinois campaign}}\nFrom the 1750s to the peace treaty that ended the War of 1812, the British had a long-standing goal of creating an [[Indian barrier state]], a large \"neutral\" Indian state that would cover most of the Old Northwest. It would be independent of the United States and under the tutelage of the British, who would use it to block American expansion and to build up their control of the [[fur trade]] headquartered in Montreal.<ref>Dwight L. Smith, \"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea,\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 61#2\u20134 (1989): 46\u201363.</ref>\n\nA new colony, named [[Charlotina]], was proposed for the southern Great Lakes region. However, facing [[Pontiac's Rebellion|armed opposition]] by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], the British issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|Proclamation of 1763]], which prohibited [[White American|white]] colonial settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. This action angered American colonists interested in expansion, as well as those who had already settled in the area. In 1774, by the [[Quebec Act]], Britain annexed the region to the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] in order to provide a civil government and to centralize British administration of the Montreal-based fur trade. The prohibition of settlement west of the Appalachians remained, contributing to the [[American Revolution]].\n\nIn February 1779, [[George Rogers Clark]] of the [[Virginia Militia]] [[Illinois campaign|captured Kaskaskia and Vincennes]] from British commander [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]]. Virginia capitalized on Clark's success by laying claim to the whole of the Old Northwest, calling it [[Illinois County]], Virginia,<ref>Palmer, pp. 400\u2013421.{{full citation needed|date= December 2013}}</ref> until 1784, when Virginia ceded its land claims to the federal government.\n\nBritain officially ceded the area north of the Ohio River and west of the Appalachians to the United States at the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]] with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], but the British continued to maintain a presence in the region as late as 1815, the end of the [[War of 1812]].\n\n===Cessions by the states===\n{{main|State cessions}}\nSeveral states (Virginia, Massachusetts, New York, and Connecticut) had competing claims on the territory: Virginia claimed all of what were formerly Illinois Country and Ohio Country; Massachusetts claimed what are today southern Michigan and Wisconsin; Connecticut claimed a narrow strip across the territory just south of the Great Lakes; New York claimed an elastic portion of Iroquis lands between Lake Erie and the Ohio River. The western boundary of Pennsylvania was also ill-defined. Virginia's jurisdiction was limited to a few French settlements at the extreme western edge of the territory. Massachusett's and Connecticut's claims were effectively lines on paper. New York had no colonial settlements or territorial government in the claimed lands.\n\nThe western border of Pennsylvania, previously assumed to run in a north by northeast zigzag, was resolved in 1780 by the Continental Congress. The Mason\u2013Dixon line was extended westward to a point five degrees of longitude (about 260 miles) from the Delaware River and the western boundary extended to run due north from the western-most extent of the Mason\u2013Dixon line to the 43rd parallel. This incorporated the eastern part of Ohio Country as western Pennsylvania, and set the eastern boundary of federal lands.\n\n\"Unlanded\" states, such as Maryland, refused to ratify the [[Articles of Confederation]] so long as these states were allowed to keep their western territory, fearing that those states could continue to grow and tip the balance of power in their favor under the proposed system of federal government. As a concession to obtain ratification, these states ceded their claims on the territory to the federal government: New York in 1780, Virginia in 1784, and Massachusetts and Connecticut in 1785. So the majority of the territory became public land owned by the U.S. government. Virginia and Connecticut reserved two areas to use as compensation to military veterans: The [[Virginia Military District]]<ref>Virginia ceded to the United States its claim to undeeded land in the VMC on Dec. 8, 1852. In 1871, Congress ceded this land to the state.</ref> and the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]]<ref>In 1800, Connecticut ceded its Western Reserve claims to the Northwest Territory, and it came under the sovereignty of Ohio in 1803.</ref>\n\nThomas Jefferson's [[Land Ordinance of 1784]] was the first organization of the territory by the United States; it provided a process for dividing the territory into individual states.  The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established a [[Public Land Survey System|standardized system for surveying the land]] into saleable lots, although Ohio would be partially surveyed several times using different methods, resulting in a patchwork of land surveys in Ohio. Some older French communities' property claims based on earlier systems of long, narrow lots also were retained. The rest of the Northwest Territory was divided into roughly uniform square townships and sections, which facilitated land sales and development. The ordinance also stipulated that the territory would eventually form at least three but not more than five new states.<ref>{{cite book |last=Calloway |first=Colin G. |year=2015 |title=The Victory with No Name. The Native American Defeat of the First American Army |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=50}}</ref>\n\n===Founding of the territory===\nUnder the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, which created the Northwest Territory, General St. Clair was appointed governor. When the territory was divided in 1800, he briefly served as governor of the Northwest Territory remnant that included Ohio, the eastern half of Michigan, and a sliver of southeastern Indiana called \"The Gore.\"\n\nSt. Clair formally established the government on July 15, 1788, at [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]]. In 1790, he renamed the settlement of Losantiville [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], after the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], and moved the administrative and military center to [[Fort Washington (Ohio)|Fort Washington]].\n\nAs Governor, he formulated the [[Maxwell's Code]] (named after its printer, [[William Maxwell (engraver)|William Maxwell]]), the first written criminal and civil laws of the territory. Maxwell's Code consisted of thirty-seven different laws with the stipulation that the laws had to have been passed previously in one of the original thirteen states. The laws restructured the court system then in effect in the Northwest Territory. They also protected residents against excessive taxes and declared that English common law would be the basis of legal decisions and laws in the Northwest Territory.\n\n[[File:ST.CLAIR, Arthur (signed check).jpg|thumb|Check signed by [[Arthur St. Clair]] while governor of the Northwest Territory (1796)]]\n\n===Northwest Indian War===\n{{Main|Northwest Indian War}}\n{{Further|Western Confederacy|Harmar Campaign|Big Bottom massacre|St. Clair's Defeat|Legion of the United States|Siege of Fort Recovery|Battle of Fallen Timbers|Treaty of Greenville}}\nThe young United States government, deeply in debt following the Revolutionary War and lacking authority to tax under the [[Articles of Confederation]], planned to raise revenue from the methodical sale of land in the Northwest Territory. This plan necessarily called for the removal of both Native American villages and squatters from lands west of Appalachia, loosely, the territory called \"Ohio Country\" and beyond.<ref>{{cite book |last=Calloway |first=Colin G. |year=2015 |title=The Victory with No Name.

In 1789, he succeeded in getting certain Indians to sign the [[Treaty of Fort Harmar]], but many native leaders had not been invited to participate in the negotiations or had refused to do so. Rather than settling the Indians' claims, the treaty provoked an escalation of the  \"[[Northwest Indian War]]\" (or \"Little Turtle's War\"). Mutual hostilities led to a campaign by General [[Josiah Harmar]], whose 1,500 militiamen were [[Harmar Campaign|defeated]] by the Indians in October 1790.<ref>Michael S. Warner, \"General Josiah Harmar's Campaign Reconsidered: How the Americans Lost the Battle of Kekionga.\" ''Indiana Magazine of History'' (1987): 43\u201364.

He led a [[punitive expedition]] involving two Regular Army regiments and some militia. In October 1791 as an advance post for his campaign, [[Fort Jefferson (Ohio)]], was built under his direction. Located in present-day [[Darke County]] in far western Ohio, the fort was built of wood and intended primarily as a supply depot; accordingly, it was originally named Fort Deposit. One month later, near modern-day [[Fort Recovery]], his force advanced to the location of Indian settlements near the headwaters of the [[Wabash River]], but on November 4 they were routed in battle by a tribal confederation led by [[Miami tribe|Miami]] Chief [[Little Turtle]] and Shawnee chief [[Blue Jacket]]. More than 600 soldiers and scores of women and children were killed in the battle, known as \"[[St. Clair's Defeat]]\" and many other names. It remains the greatest defeat of a US Army by Native Americans in history, with about 623 American soldiers killed in action and about 50 Native American killed. Although an investigation exonerated him, St. Clair resigned his army commission in March 1792 at the request of President Washington, but continued to serve as Governor of the Northwest Territory.<ref>Leroy V.

Wayne was commissioned to form a new army of 5120 professional soldiers, dubbed the \"Legion of the United States\". Wayne recruited and trained his army in Pennsylvania, and moved them to southwestern Ohio in fall of 1793. There they were joined by the Kentucky Militia under Major General [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]]. Over the next ten months, the armies marched north up the Great Miami and Maumee River valleys toward the Miami capital of Kekionga. Along the way Wayne's legion built a series of outpost forts including Fort Greene Ville, Fort Recovery and Fort Defiance. Fierce battles occurred around some of these but none of Wayne's forts were ever taken by the Indians. \n{{missing info|siege of Fort Recovery summer 1794|date=January 2019}}\nIn mid 1794, the British built [[Fort Miami (Ohio)|Fort Miamis]] near what is today Toledo, Ohio, to forestall Wayne's putative advance on the British stronghold at Detroit. The final battle of Wayne's campaign occurred within the scope of this fort. The military campaign of Gen. Wayne against the Western Confederacy, who were supported by a British company, culminated with victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794. Following the battle, in fall 1794, Wayne's army marched unopposed to Kekionga where they constructed Fort Wayne, a defiant symbol of U.S. sovereignty in the heart of Indian Country.\n\n[[Jay's Treaty]], in 1794, temporarily helped to smooth relations with British traders in the region, where British citizens outnumbered American citizens throughout the 1790s. The following year, the [[Treaty of Greenville]] secured peace on the western frontier and opened most of southern and eastern Ohio for settlement.\n\n===Settlement===\n{{Further|Vincennes Tract|Clark's Grant|Symmes Purchase|Ohio Company|Connecticut Land Company|Purchase on the Muskingum|Seven Ranges}}\n\nSporadic westward emigrant settlements had already resumed late in the war{{which|date=December 2018}} after the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]'s power was broken and the tribes scattered by the 1779 [[Sullivan Expedition]]. Soon after the Revolution ended, land-hungry migrants started moving west. A gateway trading post developed as the town of [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]], which was a key outfitting center west of the mountains. Other wagon roads, such as the [[Kittanning Path]] surmounting the [[gaps of the Allegheny]] in central Pennsylvania, or trails along the [[Mohawk River]] in New York, enabled a steady stream of settlers to reach the near west and the lands bordering the Mississippi.{{efn|Before the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]], the western border of U.S. territory ended on the Mississippi; the lands beyond still being a possession of Napoleonic France or the [[Kingdom of Spain]].}} This activity stimulated the development of the eastern parts of the eventual [[National Road]] by private investors. The [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland&ndash;Brownsville]] toll road linked the water routes of the [[Potomac River]] with the [[Monongahela River]] of the Ohio/Mississippi riverine systems in the days when water travel was the only good alternative to walking and riding. Most of the territory and its successors was settled by emigrants passing through the [[Cumberland Narrows]], or along the [[Mohawk Valley region|Mohawk Valley]] in New York State.\n\nThe Continental Congress' title to the lands north of the Ohio River was derived from the Treaty of Paris (1783), the Treaty of Fort McIntosh, and the cessions of four states.  Settlement was through several means: squatters, direct U.S. government land sales to settlers, sales of tracts of land to land companies, and state sales of land to veterans in the Virginia Military District and Connecticut Western Reserve.  The first area to be surveyed was the [[Seven Ranges]] along the eastern border of Ohio in 1786\u20131789.  Direct sales of federal lands to individual homesteaders started here.  In some cases, the government granted or donated land for special purposes.\n\nSettlement followed the forts, whether garrisoned or not.  Lack of a garrison meant that threat of Indian attack had become negligible.  This was true everywhere in Ohio before 1800 except the northwest sector above the Greenville Treaty line. It became true in Indiana after the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811; by 1813 Battle of the Thames where Tecumseh was defeated and killed, the frontier had essentially moved to west of the Mississippi.  The first U.S. military garrisons in the territory were Fort Patrick Henry, Vincennes, Indiana (1779), Fort Clark at Falls of the Ohio, Indiana (1783), and Fort Harmar in Ohio (1785).  The first settlements were at these locations.\n\nThe [[Clark's Grant|first land grant]] was to George Rogers Clark in 1781 at Falls of the Ohio on the Indiana side; he went on to found the settlement of Clarksville. The first two land purchases were large tracts of land sold to John Symmes ([[Symmes Purchase]]) in 1788 and two tracts sold to Ohio Company in 1787 and 1792 ([[Purchase on the Muskingum]]). Settlement of these areas was spearheaded by Losantiville and Marietta, respectively. In 1792, Congress [[Donation Tract|donated 100,000 acres]] to Ohio Company as a buffer zone against Indian incursion around the settled area. The vexing land claims by inhabitants of the old French Vincennes Tract were finally resolved by what was dubbed the 'Vincennes donation lands' embodied in a federal land act of 1791. Federal land sales in Indiana (then a part of Indiana Territory starting in 1800) didn't begin until 1801, through the Cincinnati land office.\n\nAccording to the 1800 Census of the United States, the Northwest Territory (i.e. the pending state of Ohio) had a population, excluding Indians, of over 45,000, and Indiana Territory, a population of about 5,600.  By the time of Ohio statehood, there were as many as 50 named towns in Northwest and Indiana Territories, a few, like Vincennes, with thousands of settlers, and dozens of unnamed settlements below the Treaty Line in Ohio.\n\nFollowing settlement of the frontier, the great wave of colonial immigration flowed westward, founding the great cities of the eventual 6 states of the Territory which is now the midwestern United States  early in the 19th century: Detroit (<1800), Columbus (1812), Indianapolis (1822),  Chicago (1833), Milwaukee (1846), Minneapolis (1847).\n\n===Statehood for Ohio===\nA [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]], St. Clair hoped to see two states made of the Ohio Territory to increase Federalist power in [[United States Congress|Congress]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} However, he was resented by Ohio Democratic-Republicans for what was perceived as his partisanship, high-handedness and arrogance in office.  In 1802, his opposition to plans for Ohio statehood led President [[Thomas Jefferson]] to remove him from office as territorial governor.  He thus played no part in the organizing of the state of [[Ohio]] in 1803.  The first [[Ohio Constitution]] provided for a weak governor and a strong [[legislature]], in part a reaction to St. Clair's method of governance.\n\nOn July 4, 1800, in preparation for Ohio's statehood, the [[Indiana Territory]] was decreed by an act of the U.S. Congress,<ref>An ACT to divide the territory of the United States north-west of the Ohio, into two separate governments</ref> signed into law by [[John Adams|President John Adams]] on May 7, 1800, effective on July 4. The Congressional legislation encompassed all land west of the present Indiana\u2013Ohio border and its northward extension to [[Lake Superior]], reducing the Northwest Territory to present-day Ohio and the eastern half of Michigan's [[Lower Peninsula]]. The [[Enabling Act of 1802]] authorized creation of the state of Ohio from the remainder of the Northwest Territory. Ohio was admitted as the 17th state on March 1, 1803. A few days later, the residual land was annexed to [[Indiana Territory]], and the Northwest Territory went out of existence. Ongoing disputes with the British over the region were a contributing factor to the War of 1812. Britain irrevocably ceded claim to the former Northwest Territory with the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1814.\n\n{{Further|Indiana Territory|History of Ohio}}\n\n==Northwest Ordinance==\n{{Main|Northwest Ordinance}}\n\nThe Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established the Northwest Territory, and defined its boundaries, form of government, and administrative structure.  In particular, it defined the bodies of government, established the legal basis of land ownership, provided for abolition and transfer of state territorial claims, made rules for admission of new states, established public education, recognized and codified 'natural rights', prohibited slavery, and defined the land rights and applicability of laws to the Indians.\n\n===Law and government===\n[[File:United States 1789-08-1790-04.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Map of the states and territories of the United States as it was on August 7, 1789, when the Northwest Territory was first organized, to April 2, 1790, when the future [[Southwest Territory]] was ceded by North Carolina]]\nAt first, the [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] had a modified form of [[martial law]]. The governor was also the senior army [[Commissioned officer|officer]] within the territory, and he combined [[legislative]] and [[executive branch|executive authority]]. But a [[supreme court]] was established, and he shared legislative powers with the [[court]]. County governments were organized as soon as the population was sufficient, and these assumed local [[Public administration|administrative]] and [[judicial]] functions. [[Washington County, Ohio|Washington County]] was the first of these, at [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]] in 1788. This was an important event, as this court was the first establishment of civil and criminal law in the pioneer country.\n\nAs soon as the number of free male [[settler]]s exceeded 5,000, the territorial legislature was to be created, and this happened in 1798. The full mechanisms of government were put in place, as outlined in the [[Northwest Ordinance]]. A [[bicameral legislature]] consisted of a [[State legislature (United States)|House of Representatives]] and a Council. The first House had 22 [[Legislator|representatives]], apportioned by population of each county.<ref name=ohio1917>{{cite book |title= Manual of Legislative Practice in the General Assembly |author= Ohio General Assembly |page= 199 |year= 1917 |publisher= State of Ohio |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7qesAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA199|author-link= Ohio General Assembly }}</ref> The House then nominated 10 citizens to be Council members. The nominations were sent to the U.S. Congress, which appointed five of them as the Council. This assembly became the legislature of the Territory, although the governor retained veto power.\n\nArticle VI of the Articles of Compact within the Northwest Ordinance prohibited the owning of [[History of slavery in the United States|slaves]] within the Northwest Territory. However, territorial governments evaded this law by use of indenture laws.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.statelib.lib.in.us/www/ihb/publications/terrslavery.html  |publisher= Indiana Historical Bureau |title= Slavery in Indiana Territory |accessdate= July 24, 2013 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070721043832/http://www.statelib.lib.in.us/www/ihb/publications/terrslavery.html |archivedate=July 21, 2007 }}</ref> The Articles of Compact prohibited legal discrimination on the basis of religion within the territory.\n\nThe [[Township (United States)|township]] formula created by [[Thomas Jefferson]] was first implemented in the Northwest Territory through the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]].

The first session of the Assembly was held in September 1799. Its first important task was to select a non-voting [[United States congressional delegations from Northwest Territory|delegate to the U.S. Congress]]. Locked in a power struggle with Governor St. Clair, the legislature narrowly elected William Henry Harrison as the first delegate over the governor's son, Arthur St. Clair, Jr. Subsequent congressional delegates were [[William McMillan (congressman)|William McMillan]] (1800\u20131801) and [[Paul Fearing]] (1801\u20131803).\n\n===Land ownership===\nThe Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established the concept of [[fee simple]] ownership, by which ownership was in perpetuity with unlimited power to sell or give it away.\n\n===Prohibition of slavery===\nThe ordinance was the first of its kind in prohibiting slavery in a U.S. state or territory, but a fugitive slave clause allowed slave owners in other states to reclaim runaway slaves.\n\n===Indian lands===\nIn regards to the [[Delaware]] Native Americans living in the region, Congress decided, on July 27, 1787, that 10,000 acres on the [[Muskingum River]] in the present state of Ohio would \"be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the [[Moravian Brethren]] . . . or a society of the said Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web |title= Religion and the Congress of the Confederation, 1774\u201389 |url= https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html |publisher= Library of Congress |accessdate= November 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\n\nThe [[Northwest Ordinance]] called for a public university for the education, settlement and eventual statehood of the [[Ohio Country|frontier of Ohio and beyond]].

The ordinance divided the territory into 36 mile<sup>2</sup> townships, and each township was further divided into 36 one mile<sup>2</sup> tracts for purposes of sale.  The ordinance then stated that \"there shall be reserved from sale the lot No. 16 of every township for the maintenance of public schools within the said township.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Knight |first=George Wells |title=History, and Management of Land Grants for Education in the Northwest Territory (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin) |year=1885 |publisher=G.

Most forts were military garrisons only. Early settlements were outside or nearby forts: Clarksville, Vincennes, Kaskaskia (French), Losantiville, and the Ohio Company settlements at Marietta and Waterford/Beverly. Later, after the Treaty of Greenville, settlements no longer needed to be spearheaded by forts, and sprang up everywhere simultaneously below the Treaty Line. There were dozens of unnamed settlements in addition to these. Michigan forts and settlements belonged to the British until 1796; Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota were wilderness and Indian lands.\n\n[[File:USPostRoadMap1796.jpg|right|thumb|[[Abraham Bradley Jr.|Abraham Bradley's]] 1796 map of the United States includes many forts and settlements within the Northwest Territory.]]\n*[[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia]], Illinois, 1778\n*Fort Gage/[[Kaskaskia, Illinois]], 1779, an American/French settlement\n*[[Fort Patrick Henry]]/Vincennes, Indiana 1779\n*[[Fort Nelson (Kentucky)|Fort Nelson]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Falls of the Ohio]], 1781\n*[[Clarksville, Indiana]], 1783 (Louisville, KY, also grew out of this settlement)\n*[[Fort Finney (Ohio)|Fort Finney]], Ohio, 1785, moved to Fort Finney, Indiana, 1786\n*[[Fort Harmar]], Ohio, 1785\n*[[Fort Finney (Indiana)|Fort Finney]]/Jeffersonville, Indiana, 1786\n*[[Fort Steuben]], Ohio, Jan. 1787, abandoned May 1787\n*[[Marietta, Ohio]], July, 1788\n*[[Columbia-Tusculum, Cincinnati|Columbia, Ohio]], Nov. 1788\n*Losantiville ([[Cincinnati]]), Ohio, Dec. 1788\n*[[North Bend, Ohio]], Feb., 1789\n*[[Waterford, Ohio|Waterford]] and [[Beverly, Ohio|Beverly]], Ohio, spring, 1789\n*[[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]], Ohio, summer, 1789 (later, Newport Barracks, Louisville, Kentucky)\n*[[Manchester, Ohio|Massie's Station]], Virginia Military District, 1790, renamed Manchester\n*Fort Dilles, Ohio, 1790, later called [[Dilles Bottom, Ohio|Dilles Bottom]]\n*[[Gallipolis]], Ohio, Oct. 1790\n*[[Stockport, Ohio|Big Bottom]], Ohio, Dec. 1790 (squatter settlement, site of [[Big Bottom Massacre]] in 1791)\n*[[Fort Frye]], Ohio, Jan.\u2013Feb. 1791 (not a U.S. military garrison)\n*[[Hamilton, Ohio#History|Fort Hamilton]], Ohio, September 1791\n*[[Fort Jefferson (Ohio)|Fort Jefferson]], Ohio, October 1791  (originally Fort Deposit)\n*[[Fort St. Clair]], Ohio, 1792\n*[[Fort Greene Ville]], Ohio, Nov. 1793\n*[[Fort Recovery]], Ohio, Dec. 1793 \u2013 Mar. 1794\n*[[Fort Adams (Ohio)|Fort Adams]], Ohio, August 1794\n*[[Fort Massac]], Illinois, Jun. \u2013 Oct. 1794\n*[[Fort Defiance (Ohio)|Fort Defiance]], Ohio, August 1794\n(Battle of Fallen Timbers, Aug. 1794)\n*Fort Deposit, Ohio, Sept. \u2013 Oct., 1794\n*[[Fort Wayne (fort)|Fort Wayne]], Indiana, October 1794\n*[[Fort Loramie, Ohio#History|Fort Loramie]] (or Laramie), Ohio, winter 1794/95\n*[[Piqua, Ohio#History|Fort Piqua]], Ohio, winter 1794/95\n*Fort St. Mary's, Ohio, Oct. 1795\n*Jefferson, 1795, now [[Martins Ferry, Ohio|Martins Ferry]]\n*[[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]], Ohio, 1796\n*[[Cleveland]], Connecticut Western Reserve, 1796\n*[[Fort Miami (Ohio)|Fort Miami]], Ohio, ceded to U.S. 1796\n*[[Fort Lernoult]] (previously [[Fort Detroit]]), Michigan, ceded to U.S. 1796\n*[[Fort Mackinac]], Michigan, ceded to U.S. 1796\n*[[Williamsburg, Ohio]], 1796\n*[[Dayton, Ohio]], 1796\n*Newellstown, Ohio, 1796, renamed [[St. Clairsville, Ohio|St. Clairsville]]\n*[[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]] Ohio, 1797\n*[[Athens, Ohio|Athens]], Ohio, 1797\n*[[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]], Ohio, 1797\n*[[Warren, Ohio]], 1798\n*[[Bethel, Ohio]], 1798\n*[[Zanesville, Ohio]], 1799\n*[[Lancaster, Ohio]], 1800\n*[[Springfield, Ohio]], 1801\n*[[Youngstown, Ohio]], 1802\n*[[Coshocton, Ohio]], 1802\n*[[Lawrenceburg, Indiana]], 1802 (the Gore, part of Ohio until 1803)\n*New Lisbon, Ohio, 1803, later renamed [[Lisbon, Ohio|Lisbon]]\n*[[Xenia, Ohio]], 1803\n*[[Mentor, Ohio]], after 1800\nSettlements in states other than Ohio after 1800 are part of the History of Indiana Territory.\n\n==Territorial counties==\n[[File:MELIOREM LAPSA LOCAVIT.JPG|thumb|Seal of the Northwest Territory over a time capsule outside the [[Campus Martius Museum]].
