{"title_page": "Metropolitan Railway electric multiple units", "text_new": "[[File:Neasden metropolitan line station geograph-2384536-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|T stock multiple unit at Neasden|alt=A black and white image of an electric multiple unit on the furthest of four tracks.]]\n'''Metropolitan Railway electric multiple units''' were used on London's [[Metropolitan Railway]] after the lines were electrified in the early 20th century.\n\nAfter a joint experiment with the [[District Railway]] with which they operated the [[Circle line (London Underground)|inner circle]] in London, a four rail DC system was chosen. The first Metropolitan Railway [[electric multiple unit]]s ran on 1 January 1905 from Uxbridge to Baker Street, the circle service began a full electric service on 24 September 1905 and an electric service started on the joint Hammersmith and City line on 5 November 1906.\n\nMore trains were purchased in 1915 and 1921 to replace and supplement those operating the circle service. In 1927-33 compartment stock was built for use on the Extension line out of Baker Street through Harrow.\n\nIn 1933 the railway was amalgamated with the other London underground railway companies to form the [[London Passenger Transport Board]]. The older stock was withdrawn after replacement by the [[London Underground O and P Stock|O Stock]] in the 1930s, the Circle stock was renovated and was later replaced by P Stock in 1950 and the units which ran on the Extension line were standardised and designated [[London Underground T Stock|T Stock]], and later replaced by [[London Underground A60 and A62 Stock|A Stock]] in 1963.\n\n==Electrification==\nThe [[Metropolitan Railway]] was opened in 1863 with wooden carriages hauled by [[steam locomotive]]s, but at the start of the 20th century the railway was seeing increased competition in central London from the new [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London|Underground Electric Railways of London]] (UERL) tube lines and the use of buses. The use of steam underground led to smoke-filled stations and carriages which was unpopular with passengers, and conversion to electric traction was seen as the way forward.{{sfn|Horne|2003|p=28}}\n\nBecause of the jointly operated ''[[Circle line (London Underground)|Inner Circle]]'' co-operation with the [[District Railway]] was essential. A jointly owned experimental train of six coaches was tested on passenger service on an Earl's Court to High Street Kensington shuttle in 1900. Composed of four trailers and two motor cars this had pick up shoes which made contact with conductor rails energised at 600 V [[direct current|DC]] on both sides of the track. Although the motor cars were connected by a bus line, there was no multiple working, meaning only the leading motor car was powered.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|pp=27, 28}}\n\nThe experiment was considered a success, and following tenders a 3000V AC system was recommended by the electrification joint committee,{{sfn|Bruce|1983|pp=28, 29}} and this was accepted by both parties until the [[United States|American]] led UERL took control of the District. The group was led by [[Charles Yerkes]], whose experience in the United States led him to favour DC, with conductor rail similar to that in use on the [[City & South London Railway]] and [[Central London Railway]]. After arbitration by the [[Board of Trade]] a DC system with [[Fourth rail|four rails]] was taken up and the railways began electrifying their routes, using multiple-unit stock and electric locomotives hauling carriages.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=25}}\n\n==Early units==\n[[File:Metropolitan Railway electric stock trailer carriage, 1904 01.JPG|thumb|A badly fire damaged trailer built in 1904&ndash;05 is in store at LTM's Acton Depot]]\nThe first order was placed with Metropolitan Amalgamated in 1902 for 50 trailers and 20 motor cars, which were intended to run as ten 7-car trains, although due to problems with platform lengths these ran as 6-car trains. They were open saloon cars with access at the ends via open lattice gates. The units had two motor cars which were equipped with Westinghouse electric equipment and four {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} motors, and ran off-peak as 3-car units with a motor car and a driving trailer. Twenty 6-cars trains were ordered for the [[Hammersmith & City line]] that the Met jointly operated with the [[Great Western Railway]] with Thomson-Houston equipment (BTH) and GE76 150&nbsp;hp motors. In 1904 an order was placed for a further 36 motor cars and 62 trailers with an option for a further 20 motor cars and 40 trailers. However problems with the Westinghouse equipment (BWE) meant when the option was taken up Thomson-Houston equipment (BTH) was specified, but more powerful {{convert|200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} GE69 motors were fitted.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|pp=37\u201339}}\n\nThe first [[electric multiple unit]]s ran on 1 January 1905 from Uxbridge to Baker Street, the Uxbridge branch having opened in July 1904 and worked by steam for six months.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=25}} After problems with the Metropolitan shoegear on the District Railway were solved the inner circle began a full electric service on 24 September 1905,{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=40}} reducing the travel time from seventy to fifty minutes,{{sfn|Simpson|2003|p=152}} and an electric service started on the Hammersmith and City line on 5 November 1906.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=26}}\n\nThe trains had first and third class accommodation with electric lighting and heating. However, it was quickly found that the lattice gates left the coach ends exposed when working in the open and the cars were modified with vestibules from 1906. Having access only from the end of the coaches was a problem on the busy circle line and centre sliding doors were added from 1911.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|pp=37\u201339}} Up to 1918 the motor cars with the more powerful GE69 motors were used on the Circle line with three trailers.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=41}}\n\nIn 1910 two motor cars were modified with driving cabs at both ends. One had 150&nbsp;BWE equipment and the other 150&nbsp;BTH, and they started work on the Uxbridge shuttle service, before being transferred to the Addison Road shuttle in 1918. From 1925 to 1934 these vehicles worked between Watford and Rickmansworth.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=66}}\n{{-}}\n\n==GN&C Stock==\n{{main|London Underground GN&C Stock}}\nIn 1913 the Metropolitan bought the [[Great Northern and City Railway]] which ran from Finsbury Park directly into the City of London at Moorgate.  It operated with electric multiple units and the original GN&C Stock operated on the line between 1904 and 1939.\n\n==M and N Stock==\nFollowing electrification there were surplus carriages. The Ashbury bogie stock had been built recently and from 1906 some of these carriages were converted into multiple units.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=26}} Initially two 4-car rakes were converted by fitting control equipment and cabs to run with 150 BWE motor cars. It was found these were underpowered and the carriages were modified to use the more powerful 200 BTH motor cars. In 1907 these motor cars were needed on the inner circle services so four bogie carriages were converted into motor cars using 150 BWE equipment to make 2 x 6-car units. These were known as N stock and used on Uxbridge services until 1932 when they were reduced to four car units and transferred to the Stanmore branch.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=56}}\n\nTwo M stock 7-car units were built from Ashbury bogie stock by fitting control equipment and cabs and 200 BTH and GE 69 motors and these were later lengthened to 8-car by adding another carriage.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=56}}\n\n==Circle Stock==\n{{Main|London Underground Circle Stock}}\nIn 1913 the Metropolitan needed additional stock to serve the [[East London Railway]], and it had introduced through running at Baker Street. An order was placed for 23 motor cars and 20 trailers, saloon cars with sliding doors at the ends and the middle. All motor cars were ordered with 200 BWE equipment, but ten were installed on the [[Metropolitan Railway electric locomotives|electric locomotives]] and thirteen motor cars entered service with 200 BWE equipment and ten with 200 BTH equipment with GE69 motors, and worked with earlier stock on the circle and mainline services.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=64}}\n\nIn 1921 the electric equipment was replaced on the locomotives and the 200 BWE and 86M traction motors recovered were fitted to 20 new motor cars.

The first Metropolitan Railway [[electric multiple unit]]s ran on 1 January 1905 from Uxbridge to Baker Street, the circle service began a full electric service on 24 September 1905 and an electric service started on the joint Hammersmith and City line on 5 November 1906.\n\nMore trains were purchased in 1915 and 1921 to replace and supplement those operating the circle service. In 1927-33 compartment stock was built for use on the Extension line out of Baker Street through Harrow.\n\nIn 1933 the railway was amalgamated with the other London underground railway companies to form the [[London Passenger Transport Board]]. The older stock was withdrawn after replacement by the [[London Underground O and P Stock|O Stock]] in the 1930s, the Circle stock was renovated and was later replaced by P Stock in 1950 and the units which ran on the Extension line were standardised and designated [[London Underground T Stock|T Stock]], and later replaced by [[London Underground A60 and A62 Stock|A Stock]] in 1963.\n\n==Electrification==\nThe [[Metropolitan Railway]] was opened in 1863 with wooden carriages hauled by [[steam locomotive]]s, but at the start of the 20th century the railway was seeing increased competition in central London from the new [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London|Underground Electric Railways of London]] (UERL) tube lines and the use of buses. The use of steam underground led to smoke-filled stations and carriages which was unpopular with passengers, and conversion to electric traction was seen as the way forward.{{sfn|Horne|2003|p=28}}\n\nBecause of the jointly operated ''[[Circle line (London Underground)|Inner Circle]]'' co-operation with the [[District Railway]] was essential. A jointly owned experimental train of six coaches was tested on passenger service on an Earl's Court to High Street Kensington shuttle in 1900. Composed of four trailers and two motor cars this had pick up shoes which made contact with conductor rails energised at 600 V [[direct current|DC]] on both sides of the track. Although the motor cars were connected by a bus line, there was no multiple working, meaning only the leading motor car was powered.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|pp=27, 28}}\n\nThe experiment was considered a success, and following tenders a 3000V AC system was recommended by the electrification joint committee,{{sfn|Bruce|1983|pp=28, 29}} and this was accepted by both parties until the [[United States|American]] led UERL took control of the District. The group was led by [[Charles Yerkes]], whose experience in the United States led him to favour DC, with conductor rail similar to that in use on the [[City & South London Railway]] and [[Central London Railway]]. After arbitration by the [[Board of Trade]] a DC system with [[Fourth rail|four rails]] was taken up and the railways began electrifying their routes, using multiple-unit stock and electric locomotives hauling carriages.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=25}}\n\n==Early units==\n[[File:Metropolitan Railway electric stock trailer carriage, 1904 01.JPG|thumb|A badly fire damaged trailer built in 1904&ndash;05 is in store at LTM's Acton Depot]]\nThe first order was placed with Metropolitan Amalgamated in 1902 for 50 trailers and 20 motor cars, which were intended to run as ten 7-car trains, although due to problems with platform lengths these ran as 6-car trains. They were open saloon cars with access at the ends via open lattice gates. The units had two motor cars which were equipped with Westinghouse electric equipment and four {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} motors, and ran off-peak as 3-car units with a motor car and a driving trailer. Twenty 6-cars trains were ordered for the [[Hammersmith & City line]] that the Met jointly operated with the [[Great Western Railway]] with Thomson-Houston equipment (BTH) and GE76 150&nbsp;hp motors. In 1904 an order was placed for a further 36 motor cars and 62 trailers with an option for a further 20 motor cars and 40 trailers. However problems with the Westinghouse equipment (BWE) meant when the option was taken up Thomson-Houston equipment (BTH) was specified, but more powerful {{convert|200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} GE69 motors were fitted.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|pp=37\u201339}}\n\nThe first [[electric multiple unit]]s ran on 1 January 1905 from Uxbridge to Baker Street, the Uxbridge branch having opened in July 1904 and worked by steam for six months.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=25}} After problems with the Metropolitan shoegear on the District Railway were solved the inner circle began a full electric service on 24 September 1905,{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=40}} reducing the travel time from seventy to fifty minutes,{{sfn|Simpson|2003|p=152}} and an electric service started on the Hammersmith and City line on 5 November 1906.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=26}}\n\nThe trains had first and third class accommodation with electric lighting and heating. However, it was quickly found that the lattice gates left the coach ends exposed when working in the open and the cars were modified with vestibules from 1906. Having access only from the end of the coaches was a problem on the busy circle line and centre sliding doors were added from 1911.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|pp=37\u201339}} Up to 1918 the motor cars with the more powerful GE69 motors were used on the Circle line with three trailers.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=41}}\n\nIn 1910 two motor cars were modified with driving cabs at both ends. One had 150&nbsp;BWE equipment and the other 150&nbsp;BTH, and they started work on the Uxbridge shuttle service, before being transferred to the Addison Road shuttle in 1918. From 1925 to 1934 these vehicles worked between Watford and Rickmansworth.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=66}}\n{{-}}\n\n==GN&C Stock==\n{{main|London Underground GN&C Stock}}\nIn 1913 the Metropolitan bought the [[Great Northern and City Railway]] which ran from Finsbury Park directly into the City of London at Moorgate.  It operated with electric multiple units and the original GN&C Stock operated on the line between 1904 and 1939.\n\n==M and N Stock==\nFollowing electrification there were surplus carriages. The Ashbury bogie stock had been built recently and from 1906 some of these carriages were converted into multiple units.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=26}} Initially two 4-car rakes were converted by fitting control equipment and cabs to run with 150 BWE motor cars. It was found these were underpowered and the carriages were modified to use the more powerful 200 BTH motor cars. In 1907 these motor cars were needed on the inner circle services so four bogie carriages were converted into motor cars using 150 BWE equipment to make 2 x 6-car units. These were known as N stock and used on Uxbridge services until 1932 when they were reduced to four car units and transferred to the Stanmore branch.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=56}}\n\nTwo M stock 7-car units were built from Ashbury bogie stock by fitting control equipment and cabs and 200 BTH and GE 69 motors and these were later lengthened to 8-car by adding another carriage.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=56}}\n\n==Circle Stock==\nIn 1913 the Metropolitan needed additional stock to serve the [[East London Railway]], and it had introduced through running at Baker Street. An order was placed for 23 motor cars and 20 trailers, saloon cars with sliding doors at the ends and the middle. All motor cars were ordered with 200 BWE equipment, but ten were installed on the [[Metropolitan Railway electric locomotives|electric locomotives]] and thirteen motor cars entered service with 200 BWE equipment and ten with 200 BTH equipment with GE69 motors, and worked with earlier stock on the circle and mainline services.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=64}}\n\nIn 1921 the electric equipment was replaced on the locomotives and the 200 BWE and 86M traction motors recovered were fitted to 20 new motor cars. These were ordered with 33 trailers and 6 first class driving trailers with three pairs of double sliding doors down both sides, and introduced on circle services.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=71}}\n\nAfter London Underground was formed in 1933 the Circle stock was renovated, painted in a red and cream livery and the traction motors replaced.

Dreyfus, the direction of the CGT is slowly evolving, since the 1990s, during which it cut all organic links with the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), in favour of a more moderate stance.

The CGT was violently opposed to both the authorities and employers.

It is also a member of the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC) created in 2006.\n\nHowever, several federations and regional branches of the CGT are affiliated to the WFTU.\n\n===Professional elections===\n\nThe CGT won 34% of the vote in the employee's college during the 2008 professional elections, making it the largest trade union in terms of votes in those elections. This positive result marked the first professional election in which the CGT's vote share had not declined: it had declined constantly from 36.35% in 1987 to 32.13% in 2002.\n\n===In Africa===\n\nIn 1937 CGT began organizing workers in [[French West Africa]]. The union's functioning was interrupted by its banning by the Vichy regime, but in 1943-1948 a process of reconstruction took place. The main centers of activity were [[Senegal]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Togo]] and the [[French Soudan]]. CGT had an upper hand in the Muslim regions in comparison to its main rival CFTC, who depended on the presence of Catholic communities for its recruitment. CGT emerged as the major trade union force amongst the 100 000 strong organized labour force in Senegal and [[Mauritania]] after the Second World War.<ref>Fall, Mar.

A leader of CGT in French West Africa, Bassirou Gu\u00e8ye, promoted this idea. At a meeting of the Territorial Union of Trade Unions in Senegal and Mauritania, held in [[Dakar]] November 11\u2013November 12, 1955, the majority of delegates voted for separation from the French CGT. A conference was held in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]] on January 14\u2013January 15, 1956 which formed the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des travailleurs africains]] (CGTA), separating the parts of the West African CGT organizations from the French CGT.

It is also a member of the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC) created in 2006.\n\nHowever, several federations and regional branches of the CGT are affiliated to the WFTU.\n\n===Professional elections===\n\nThe CGT won 34% of the vote in the employee's college during the 2008 professional elections, making it the largest trade union in terms of votes in those elections. This positive result marked the first professional election in which the CGT's vote share had not declined: it had declined constantly from 36.35% in 1987 to 32.13% in 2002.\n\n===In Africa===\n\nIn 1937 CGT began organizing workers in [[French West Africa]]. The union's functioning was interrupted by its banning by the Vichy regime, but in 1943-1948 a process of reconstruction took place. The main centers of activity were [[Senegal]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Togo]] and the [[French Soudan]]. CGT had an upper hand in the Muslim regions in comparison to its main rival CFTC, who depended on the presence of Catholic communities for its recruitment. CGT emerged as the major trade union force amongst the 100 000 strong organized labour force in Senegal and [[Mauritania]] after the Second World War.<ref>Fall, Mar. ''L'\u00c9tat et la Question Syndicale au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal''. Paris: \u00c9ditions L'Harmattan, 1989. p. 24, 27</ref>\n\nWithin the CGT branches in the region, there was however a growing wish for independence. A leader of CGT in French West Africa, Bassirou Gu\u00e8ye, promoted this idea. At a meeting of the Territorial Union of Trade Unions in Senegal and Mauritania, held in [[Dakar]] November 11\u2013November 12, 1955, the majority of delegates voted for separation from the French CGT. A conference was held in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]] on January 14\u2013January 15, 1956 which formed the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des travailleurs africains]] (CGTA), separating the parts of the West African CGT organizations from the French CGT. At the conference 50 out of 67 delegates had voted for separation.<ref>Fall, Mar. ''L'\u00c9tat et la Question Syndicale au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal''. Paris: \u00c9ditions L'Harmattan, 1989. p. 31\u201332</ref>\n\nIn Togo, CGT had 45,100 members in 1948 (65% of organized labour). By 1952 the number had decreased to 34,000 (46% of organized labour).<ref>Fall, Mar. ''L'\u00c9tat et la Question Syndicale au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal''.

Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2002. p. 128</ref>\n\n===Support of week of global climate action===\nOn July 16, 2019 [[Phillipe Martinez (trade unionist)|Phillipe Martinez]], Secretary General of the CGT, announced that the union will support the [[Earth Strike|week of climate action]] beginning on September 20, 2019.<ref>La CGT pr\u00e9pare deux journ\u00e9es d'action \u00e0 la rentr\u00e9e autour de l'urgence climatique, https://mobile.francetvinfo.fr/economie/syndicats/la-cgt-prepare-deux-journees-d-action-a-la-rentree-autour-de-l-urgence-climatique_3538113.amp Article in ''FranceInfo''</ref>\n\n==Affiliates==\nThe following federations and unions are affiliated:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The fortress comprises five islands joined together by bridges, and the church is the central feature on the island of Iso Mustasaari ({{lang-sv|Stora \u00d6stersvart\u00f6}}), located at its highest point.  It is surrounded by other fortress buildings, but the old parade ground is immediately to the east, and a park lies immediately to the south.

The actual church was designed by [[Konstantin Thon]], an official architect of Imperial Russia during the reign of Czar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], whose major works included the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]], and the [[Kremlin Armoury]] in Moscow.

First, during an interview by DoD on April 24, 2018,  Lieber was asked whether he was involved in the [[Thousand Talents Program]]. Lieber stated that \"he was never asked to participate in the Thousand Talents Program\", adding that \"he 'wasn't sure' how China categorized him.\" The DOJ believes that  Lieber's statement was false, because an intercepted email dated June 27, 2012, from Wuhan University of Technology (\"WUT\") included a contract for  Lieber to sign. Second, in November 2018, the NIH inquired of Harvard University about Lieber's foreign affiliations. In January 2019, Harvard interviewed Lieber and reported to NIH that Lieber \"had no formal association with WUT\" after 2012. The DOJ believes Lieber's statement was false. Lieber was charged with two counts of violating  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2), one on April 24, 2018, and one in January 2019 for making the allegedly false statements.\n\nDuring his arraignment, authorities executed [[Search warrant|search warrants]] at his home and office in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]]. The charges against Lieber carry a sentence of five years in [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]] and a quarter million dollar fine.

According to the Department of Justice's charging document<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1239796/download|title=AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR CRIMINAL COMPLAINT (AGAINST CHARLES M. LIEBER) by Robert Plumb , FBI Special Agent|last=|first=|date=|website=US Department of Justice|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 4, 2020}}</ref>, there are two counts of alleged crime committed by Lieber. First, during an interview by DoD on April 24, 2018,  Lieber was asked whether he was involved in the [[Thousand Talents Program]]. Lieber stated that \"he was never asked to participate in the Thousand Talents Program\", adding that \"he 'wasn't sure' how China categorized him.\" The DOJ believes that  Lieber's statement was false, because an intercepted email dated June 27, 2012, from Wuhan University of Technology (\"WUT\") included a contract for  Lieber to sign. Second, in November 2018, the NIH inquired of Harvard University about Lieber's foreign affiliations. In January 2019, Harvard interviewed Lieber and reported to NIH that Lieber \"had no formal association with WUT\" after 2012. The DOJ believes Lieber's statement was false. Lieber was charged with two counts of violating  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2), one on April 24, 2018, and one in January 2019 for making the allegedly false statements.\n\nDuring his arraignment, authorities executed [[Search warrant|search warrants]] at his home and office in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]]. The charges against Lieber carry a sentence of five years in [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]] and a quarter million dollar fine.  Lieber has been placed on paid administrative leave by Harvard.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/01/28/metro/federal-prosecutors-boston-announce-charge-against-renowned-harvard-professor-lying-about-ties-program-chinese-university/|title=Harvard scientist charged with lying about ties to Chinese university; two Chinese nationals accused of economic espionage - The Boston Globe|website=BostonGlobe.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128215029/https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/01/28/metro/federal-prosecutors-boston-announce-charge-against-renowned-harvard-professor-lying-about-ties-program-chinese-university/|archive-date=2020-01-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nLieber is Jewish.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.jinfo.org/Wolf.html | title=Jewish Recipients of the Wolf Prize}}</ref> Since 2007 he has grown giant [[Pumpkin|pumpkins]] in his back yard in Lexington, Massachusetts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuvGPuI-vmc|title=Journey of the great pumpkins|last=Mahoney|first=Bryan|date=11 October 2007|website=YouTube|access-date=}}</ref> In 2010 he won the annual weigh-off at Frerich's Farm in Rhode Island with a 1,610-lb pumpkin,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.frerichsfarm.com/November%202010%20News.html|title=Frerich's Farm Newsletter/November 2010|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107223856/http://www.frerichsfarm.com/November%202010%20News.html|archive-date=2016-11-07|url-status=live}}</ref> and returned in 2012 with a 1,770-lb pumpkin that won 2nd place in that year's weigh-off but set a Massachusetts record.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/10/15/lieber-grows-prize-winning-pumpkin/|title=Chem professor grows Mass.'s largest pumpkin, no plans for pie|last=|first=|date=15 October 2014|website=The Harvard Crimson|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107223729/http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/10/15/lieber-grows-prize-winning-pumpkin/|archive-date=7 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> His 1,870-lb pumpkin in 2014 was named the largest pumpkin in Massachusetts and ranked 17th largest in the world that year.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i43/Nanoscientist-Grows-Giant-Pumpkin-Crabs.html|title=Nanoscientist grows giant pumpkin, crabs in costume|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Chemical and Engineering News 92(43):40|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107223647/http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i43/Nanoscientist-Grows-Giant-Pumpkin-Crabs.html|archive-date=2016-11-07|url-status=live}}</ref> The discrepancy between the size scales of his day job and hobby has been noted: \u201c\u2026on the one hand, Lieber\u2019s chemistry \u201chas had a defining influence on the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology,\u201d according to his CV.

It was one of the first fighting games to boast polygonal characters in a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment, and features a sidestep maneuver which is credited for taking the genre into \"true 3D.\"<ref name=\"ign_toshinden\"/> The Game Boy version of of Battle Arena Toshiden despite sharing the same name as the console & PC counterparts is a different game. It is a 2D weapons based fighter & supports the Super Game Boy cartridge peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System/Super Famicom to allow the game to be played on a TV with colour palettes & borders. \n\nThe game was announced as a PlayStation exclusive,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Toh Shin Den|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=2|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=December 1995|page=14}}</ref> with Sony initially promoting it as a \"[[Killer app|Saturn killer]]\" (against Sega's ''[[Virtua Fighter (video game)|Virtua Fighter]]''),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/virtuafighter/virtuafighter.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115002712/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/virtuafighter/virtuafighter.htm |archive-date=2015-01-15 |url-status=live}}</ref> but it was ported to the Saturn with additional features less than a year later. Once fighting games like ''[[Tekken (arcade game)|Tekken]]'' started emerging, ''Battle Arena Toshinden'' declined in popularity, but still spawned a series of sequels. It was the first 3D weapons fighter, and was succeeded in spirit by ''[[Soul Edge]]'' and other games of the genre.\n\n==Gameplay==\nEach character has his or her own unique set of basic moves, special attacks, and a desperation attack that can only be used when the player has low energy (around 10% or less). The player can move in 3D around the 3D arenas using the L/R shoulder buttons, which can be used to dodge projectile attacks or get away from a dangerous spot.\n\nPlayers move using the directional pad. Holding the backward directional button allows the player to block basic attacks and reduces most of the damage from opponents' special moves. Players can also run by quickly tapping the forward directional button.\n\nAs with other games of the genre, the player wins by depleting the opposing players health, having more health than their opponent if the time runs out, or knocking their opponent out of the non-walled arena. Unlike many fighting games of the time, it was possible for a player character to accidentally fall off the arena with a miss-timed run or special move, resulting in some unique tactics.\n\n==Plot==\nA young Japanese swordsman/adventurer named Eiji Shinjo, who has spent the past few years searching for his long-lost older brother, Sho, enters the legendary Battle Arena Toshinden tournament hosted by a mysterious organization known only as the Secret Society, along with seven other traveling fighters, the fighters themselves being Eiji's best friend/rival, Kayin Amoh, a Scottish bounty hunter who seeks revenge against the previous tournament champion of last year for the death of his foster father; Sofia, an amnesiac Russian private detective who is seeking her long-lost past memories; Rungo Iron, an American miner who is determined to rescue his kidnapped family from the Secret Society; Fo Fai, a Chinese magician/serial killer who enters the tournament in order to satisfy his personal bloodlust; Mondo, a Japanese ninja who is undertaking an infiltration mission for a rival group of the Secret Society; Duke B. Rambert, a French knight seeking revenge against Eiji for a past defeat; and Ellis, a cheerful and kind-hearted orphaned dancer who is seeking personal answers regarding her long-lost missing father.\n\nEiji progresses through the tournament and ultimately comes face-to-face with the tournament's sponsor, the mysterious Gaia and even though Eiji manages to hold his own against Gaia from within their final battle against each other, the match is unexpectedly halted when it is soon discovered that Gaia is holding the competition without the Secret Society's permission, with the intention of acquiring fighters in order to help him overthrow the organization as a part of his vendetta against them. Gaia is forced to flee into hiding while leaving Eiji no closer to finding his long-lost older brother.\n\n==Characters==\nInitially playable characters:\n*Eiji Shinjo - The main protagonist of the series. A young Japanese traveling swordsman/adventurer who seeks to find his long-lost older brother, Sho.\n*Kayin Amoh - A Scottish (later retconned as English) swordsman/bounty hunter who happens to be a friend and rival of Eiji. He seeks to avenge the death of his foster father, who was killed by the previous tournament's champion from last year.\n*Sofia - A whip-wielding blonde Russian woman who works as a private detective. She seeks to find and recover her long-lost memories.\n*Rungo Iron - A strong yet kind-hearted miner who seeks to rescue his wife Lila and his son Christopher from the Secret Society.\n*Fo Fai - An elderly Chinese magician who is secretly a cold-hearted serial killer. Fo Fai enters the tournament to satisfy his bloodlust.\n*Mondo - An emotionless Japanese ninja warrior who infiltrates the tournament under orders from a rival group of the Secret Society.\n*Duke B. Rambert - An arrogant French knight who seeks to find and defeat Eiji to avenge a past loss to him.\n*Ellis - A cheerful and kind-hearted orphaned dancer of a traveling theater troupe who seeks to discover whether or not her long-lost missing father is still alive.\n\n[[Unlockable (gaming)|Unlockable]] characters:\n*Gaia - The sponsor of the tournament and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] of the game. His reasons for holding the tournament in the first place are shrouded in mystery. He is later revealed to be the father of Ellis.\n*Sho Shinjo - The secret final boss of the game, reached by clearing the game without continues. The champion from last year's previous tournament and Eiji's older brother, he is a merciless swordsman who holds nothing back from within the fights that he participates in. His soundtrack is a variation of [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565]]\n*Cupido ([[Sega Saturn]] version) - A mysterious woman who speaks with cryptic riddles and messages. Her past is shrouded in mystery, and not much is known about her. The \"true\" final boss in this version.\n*Uranus ([[Game Boy]] version)\n*[[Earthworm Jim (series)#Earthworm Jim|Earthworm Jim]] (PC version) - A guest character who happens to be the main protagonist from his self-named series. His attacks are identical to those of Rungo Iron.\n\n==Release==\nThe original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was ported by [[Nex Entertainment|Nextech]]/[[Sega]] to the Sega Saturn as '''''Toh Shin Den S''''' in Japan and as '''''Battle Arena Toshinden Remix''''' in the United States and Europe. A few new features were added, including an exclusive new character named Cupido and a story mode which enables the player to learn a few details about the characters' story backgrounds and the reasons of why they had entered into the tournament.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Next Wave: Toh Shin Den S |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=79|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=February 1996|pages=88\u201389}}</ref> Work on the Saturn port began while the PlayStation original was still in development.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Is War Hell for Sega?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=8|quote=''Toshinden'' is almost a year old and ...

It also supports resolutions up to 640x480. The PC port uses the Japanese PlayStation version's voices and music in all regions, unlike the original PlayStation version.\n\nThe game was also ported to the [[Game Boy]] by [[Takara]] in 1996, titled '''''Nettou Toshinden''''' in Japan. The game is based mostly on the original PlayStation version, but it includes a slightly altered story mode and an early appearance of the character Uranus and the ''Battle Arena Toshinden 2'' version of Gaia (without his armor).\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 85% (PS)<ref name=\"GR\"/> <br> (2 reviews)\n| Dragon = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Dragon221\"/> (PS)\n| EGM = 32.5/40<ref name=\"EGM74\"/> (PS) <br> 21/40<ref name=\"EGM83\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Toshinden Remix|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=83|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 1996|page=28}}</ref> (SS)\n| Fam = 30/40<ref name=\"famitsu333\"/> (PS) <br> 9/10<ref name=\"famitsu323\"/> (PS) <br> 10/10<ref name=\"famitsu336\"/> (PS)\n| GamePro = 18/20<ref name=\"gamepro69\"/> (PS) <br> 17/20<ref>''GamePro'', issue 74, September 1995, page 42</ref> (PS)\n| GI = 8.5/10<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/19970811123729/http://www.gameinformer.com/sep95/tohshin.html</ref> (PS)\n| GMaster = 88%<ref>''GamesMaster'', episode 81 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ee-pyeZTjE&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 series 5, episode 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108191815/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ee-pyeZTjE&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 |date=2016-01-08 }}), September 21, 1995</ref> (PS)\n| GSpot = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Leo |first=John |title=Battle Arena Toshinden Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 18, 2013 |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/battle-arena-toshinden/reviews/battle-arena-toshinden-review-2535126/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130718032127/http://uk.gamespot.com/battle-arena-toshinden/reviews/battle-arena-toshinden-review-2535126/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 18, 2013 }}</ref> (PC)\n| IGN = 7/10<ref name=\"ign_toshinden\"/> (PS)\n| rev1 = ''[[Electric Playground]]''\n| rev1Score = 10/10<ref name=\"GR\" /> (PS)\n| rev2 = ''Maximum''\n| rev2Score = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Max1\"/> (PS) <br>{{rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"Max6\"/> (SS)\n| NGen = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"NGen4\"/> (PS)<br>{{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen15\"/> (SS)\n| rev4 = ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]''\n| rev4Score = 80%<ref name=\"ssm\"/> (SS)\n| award1Pub = ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''\n| award1 = [[List of Game of the Year awards|Best Fighting Game of 1995]]<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1996\"/>\n}}\n''Battle Arena Toshinden'' sold more than 150,000 units in the United States, leading to its inclusion in the [[Greatest Hits (PlayStation)|Greatest Hits]] range.<ref>{{cite news|title=PlayStation Leads Videogame Industry with Aggressive New Price Structure; PlayStation Game Console to Retail for $149 and PlayStation Software to be Targeted at a MSRP of $49.99 or Less|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_March_3/ai_19173261|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310162416/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_March_3/ai_19173261|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 10, 2006|accessdate=March 10, 2006|work=[[Business Wire]]|date=March 3, 1997}}</ref> ''Battle Arena Toshinden'' was also critically acclaimed when released.

Once fighting games like ''[[Tekken (arcade game)|Tekken]]'' started emerging, ''Battle Arena Toshinden'' declined in popularity, but still spawned a series of sequels. It was the first 3D weapons fighter, and was succeeded in spirit by ''[[Soul Edge]]'' and other games of the genre.\n\n==Gameplay==\nEach character has his or her own unique set of basic moves, special attacks, and a desperation attack that can only be used when the player has low energy (around 10% or less). The player can move in 3D around the 3D arenas using the L/R shoulder buttons, which can be used to dodge projectile attacks or get away from a dangerous spot.\n\nPlayers move using the directional pad. Holding the backward directional button allows the player to block basic attacks and reduces most of the damage from opponents' special moves. Players can also run by quickly tapping the forward directional button.\n\nAs with other games of the genre, the player wins by depleting the opposing players health, having more health than their opponent if the time runs out, or knocking their opponent out of the non-walled arena. Unlike many fighting games of the time, it was possible for a player character to accidentally fall off the arena with a miss-timed run or special move, resulting in some unique tactics.\n\n==Plot==\nA young Japanese swordsman/adventurer named Eiji Shinjo, who has spent the past few years searching for his long-lost older brother, Sho, enters the legendary Battle Arena Toshinden tournament hosted by a mysterious organization known only as the Secret Society, along with seven other traveling fighters, the fighters themselves being Eiji's best friend/rival, Kayin Amoh, a Scottish bounty hunter who seeks revenge against the previous tournament champion of last year for the death of his foster father; Sofia, an amnesiac Russian private detective who is seeking her long-lost past memories; Rungo Iron, an American miner who is determined to rescue his kidnapped family from the Secret Society; Fo Fai, a Chinese magician/serial killer who enters the tournament in order to satisfy his personal bloodlust; Mondo, a Japanese ninja who is undertaking an infiltration mission for a rival group of the Secret Society; Duke B. Rambert, a French knight seeking revenge against Eiji for a past defeat; and Ellis, a cheerful and kind-hearted orphaned dancer who is seeking personal answers regarding her long-lost missing father.\n\nEiji progresses through the tournament and ultimately comes face-to-face with the tournament's sponsor, the mysterious Gaia and even though Eiji manages to hold his own against Gaia from within their final battle against each other, the match is unexpectedly halted when it is soon discovered that Gaia is holding the competition without the Secret Society's permission, with the intention of acquiring fighters in order to help him overthrow the organization as a part of his vendetta against them. Gaia is forced to flee into hiding while leaving Eiji no closer to finding his long-lost older brother.\n\n==Characters==\nInitially playable characters:\n*Eiji Shinjo - The main protagonist of the series. A young Japanese traveling swordsman/adventurer who seeks to find his long-lost older brother, Sho.\n*Kayin Amoh - A Scottish (later retconned as English) swordsman/bounty hunter who happens to be a friend and rival of Eiji. He seeks to avenge the death of his foster father, who was killed by the previous tournament's champion from last year.\n*Sofia - A whip-wielding blonde Russian woman who works as a private detective. She seeks to find and recover her long-lost memories.\n*Rungo Iron - A strong yet kind-hearted miner who seeks to rescue his wife Lila and his son Christopher from the Secret Society.\n*Fo Fai - An elderly Chinese magician who is secretly a cold-hearted serial killer. Fo Fai enters the tournament to satisfy his bloodlust.\n*Mondo - An emotionless Japanese ninja warrior who infiltrates the tournament under orders from a rival group of the Secret Society.\n*Duke B. Rambert - An arrogant French knight who seeks to find and defeat Eiji to avenge a past loss to him.\n*Ellis - A cheerful and kind-hearted orphaned dancer of a traveling theater troupe who seeks to discover whether or not her long-lost missing father is still alive.\n\n[[Unlockable (gaming)|Unlockable]] characters:\n*Gaia - The sponsor of the tournament and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] of the game. His reasons for holding the tournament in the first place are shrouded in mystery. He is later revealed to be the father of Ellis.\n*Sho Shinjo - The secret final boss of the game, reached by clearing the game without continues. The champion from last year's previous tournament and Eiji's older brother, he is a merciless swordsman who holds nothing back from within the fights that he participates in. His soundtrack is a variation of [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565]]\n*Cupido ([[Sega Saturn]] version) - A mysterious woman who speaks with cryptic riddles and messages. Her past is shrouded in mystery, and not much is known about her. The \"true\" final boss in this version.\n*Uranus ([[Game Boy]] version)\n*[[Earthworm Jim (series)#Earthworm Jim|Earthworm Jim]] (PC version) - A guest character who happens to be the main protagonist from his self-named series. His attacks are identical to those of Rungo Iron.\n\n==Release==\nThe original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was ported by [[Nex Entertainment|Nextech]]/[[Sega]] to the Sega Saturn as '''''Toh Shin Den S''''' in Japan and as '''''Battle Arena Toshinden Remix''''' in the United States and Europe. A few new features were added, including an exclusive new character named Cupido and a story mode which enables the player to learn a few details about the characters' story backgrounds and the reasons of why they had entered into the tournament.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Next Wave: Toh Shin Den S |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=79|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=February 1996|pages=88\u201389}}</ref> Work on the Saturn port began while the PlayStation original was still in development.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Is War Hell for Sega?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=8|quote=''Toshinden'' is almost a year old and ...

The game is based mostly on the original PlayStation version, but it includes a slightly altered story mode and an early appearance of the character Uranus and the ''Battle Arena Toshinden 2'' version of Gaia (without his armor).\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 85% (PS)<ref name=\"GR\"/> <br> (2 reviews)\n| Dragon = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Dragon221\"/> (PS)\n| EGM = 32.5/40<ref name=\"EGM74\"/> (PS) <br> 21/40<ref name=\"EGM83\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Toshinden Remix|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=83|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 1996|page=28}}</ref> (SS)\n| Fam = 30/40<ref name=\"famitsu333\"/> (PS) <br> 9/10<ref name=\"famitsu323\"/> (PS) <br> 10/10<ref name=\"famitsu336\"/> (PS)\n| GamePro = 18/20<ref name=\"gamepro69\"/> (PS) <br> 17/20<ref>''GamePro'', issue 74, September 1995, page 42</ref> (PS)\n| GI = 8.5/10<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/19970811123729/http://www.gameinformer.com/sep95/tohshin.html</ref> (PS)\n| GMaster = 88%<ref>''GamesMaster'', episode 81 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ee-pyeZTjE&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 series 5, episode 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108191815/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ee-pyeZTjE&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 |date=2016-01-08 }}), September 21, 1995</ref> (PS)\n| GSpot = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Leo |first=John |title=Battle Arena Toshinden Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 18, 2013 |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/battle-arena-toshinden/reviews/battle-arena-toshinden-review-2535126/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130718032127/http://uk.gamespot.com/battle-arena-toshinden/reviews/battle-arena-toshinden-review-2535126/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 18, 2013 }}</ref> (PC)\n| IGN = 7/10<ref name=\"ign_toshinden\"/> (PS)\n| rev1 = ''[[Electric Playground]]''\n| rev1Score = 10/10<ref name=\"GR\" /> (PS)\n| rev2 = ''Maximum''\n| rev2Score = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Max1\"/> (PS) <br>{{rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"Max6\"/> (SS)\n| NGen = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"NGen4\"/> (PS)<br>{{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen15\"/> (SS)\n| rev4 = ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]''\n| rev4Score = 80%<ref name=\"ssm\"/> (SS)\n| award1Pub = ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''\n| award1 = [[List of Game of the Year awards|Best Fighting Game of 1995]]<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1996\"/>\n}}\n''Battle Arena Toshinden'' sold more than 150,000 units in the United States, leading to its inclusion in the [[Greatest Hits (PlayStation)|Greatest Hits]] range.<ref>{{cite news|title=PlayStation Leads Videogame Industry with Aggressive New Price Structure; PlayStation Game Console to Retail for $149 and PlayStation Software to be Targeted at a MSRP of $49.99 or Less|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_March_3/ai_19173261|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310162416/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_March_3/ai_19173261|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 10, 2006|accessdate=March 10, 2006|work=[[Business Wire]]|date=March 3, 1997}}</ref> ''Battle Arena Toshinden'' was also critically acclaimed when released.
