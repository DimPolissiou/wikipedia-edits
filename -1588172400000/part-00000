Traditionally, a prominent form of such memes consisted of [[image macros]] paired with a concept or catchphrase. In some cases, these memes used words and phrases contain intentional misspellings (such as [[lolcat]]s) or incorrect grammar (such as [[Doge (meme)|doge]] and \"[[All your base are belong to us]]\"). However, in more recent times, memes have evolved from simple image macros with text to more elaborate forms such as challenges, [[GIF]]s and [[Viral phenomenon|viral sensations]]. These small movements tend to spread from person to person via [[social network]]s, [[blog]]s, direct [[email]], or news sources. They may relate to various existing [[Internet culture]]s or [[subculture]]s, often created or spread on various websites. Fads and sensations tend to grow rapidly on the Internet, because the instant communication facilitates [[word of mouth]] transmission. Examples of such fads include posting a photo of people lying down in public places (called \"[[planking (fad)|planking]]\") and uploading a short video of people doing the [[Harlem Shake (meme)|Harlem Shake]]. \u201cDank\u201d memes have emerged as a new form of image-macros, defined by the inclusion of more surreal and nonsensical themes.\n\nThe word ''meme'' was coined by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' as an attempt to explain how ideas replicate, mutate and evolve ([[memetics]]).<ref name=\"cream\">{{Citation |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |edition=2 |isbn=978-0-19-286092-7 |page=192 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkHO9HI7koEC&pg=PA192 |quote=We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of ''imitation''.

He further referred to reproduction as \u201cparodies, remixes, or mashups\u201d (p.&nbsp;2) and listed a number of examples including, \u201c''Hitler\u2019s Downfall'' Parodies,\u201d [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hitlers-downfall-parodies] and \u201c''[[Nyan Cat]]'',\u201d among others. For the second attribute, he pointed out an example of a collision of Korean culture \"[[Gangnam Style in popular culture|Gangnam style]]\" and \u201c[[binders full of women]],\u201d a 2012 Mitt Romney presidential debate's assertion, in [[Psy]]\u2019s meme with \u201cmy binders full of women\u201d written on it. This indexes intertextual practices in political and cultural discourses of two nations.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n==History==\nEarly in the Internet's history, memes were primarily spread via [[email]] or [[Usenet]] discussion communities. [[Internet forum|Messageboards]] and [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroups]] were also popular because they allowed a simple method for people to share information or memes with a diverse population of Internet users in a short period. They encourage communication between people, and thus between meme sets, that do not normally come in contact. Furthermore, they actively promote meme-sharing within the messageboard or newsgroup population by asking for feedback, comments, opinions, etc. This format is what gave rise to early Internet memes, like the [[The Hampsterdance Song|Hampster Dance]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grunge.com/184711/the-oldest-memes-on-the-internet/|title=The oldest memes on the internet|last=Cantrell|first=Asher|date=2020-01-22|website=Grunge.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> Another factor in the increased meme transmission observed over the Internet is its interactive nature. [[Publishing|Print]] matter, [[radio]], and [[television]] are all essentially passive experiences requiring the reader, listener, or viewer to perform all necessary cognitive processing; in contrast, the social nature of the Internet allows phenomena to propagate more readily. Many phenomena are also spread via [[web search engine]]s, [[Internet forum]]s, [[social networking service]]s, [[Social news website|social news]] sites, and [[video hosting service]]s. Much of the Internet's ability to spread information is assisted from results found through search engines, which can allow users to find memes even with obscure information.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Memes On the Internet |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C004367/ce7.shtml |publisher=[[Oracle Thinkquest]] |access-date=November 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511193449/http://library.thinkquest.org/C004367/ce7.shtml |archivedate=May 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Marshall |first=Garry |title=The Internet and Memetics |url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Conf/MemePap/Marshall.html |publisher=School of Computing Science, [[Middlesex University]]|access-date=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119134239/http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Conf/MemePap/Marshall.html|archive-date=January 19, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe earlier forms of image based memes include the demotivator, image macro, photoshopped image, LOLCats, advice animal, and comic.<ref name=\":0222\">{{Cite book|last=Denisova, Anastasia,|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1090540034|title=Internet memes and society : social, cultural, and political contexts|isbn=978-0-429-46940-4|location=New York, NY|oclc=1090540034}}</ref> The Demotivator image includes a black background with white, capitalized, text.

At the time, memes were just short clips that were shared between people in [[Usenet]] forums. As the Internet evolved, so did memes. When [[YouTube]] was released in 2005, video memes became popular. Around this time, [[rickrolling]] became popular and the link to this video was sent around via email or other messaging sites. Video sharing also created memes such as \"[[Turn Down for What]]\" and the \"[[Harlem Shake (meme)|Harlem Shake]]\". As social media websites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] started appearing, it was now easy to share [[GIF]]s and [[image macro]]s to a large audience. Meme generator websites were created to let users create their own memes out of existing templates. Memes during this time could remain popular for a long time, from a few months to a decade, which contrasts with the fast lifespan of modern memes.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/story/guide-memes/ |title=The WIRED Guide to Memes |journal=WIRED|access-date=November 30, 2018 |first1=Angela |last1=Watercutter |first2=Emma |last2=Grey Ellisby |date=April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201164321/https://www.wired.com/story/guide-memes/|archive-date=February 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAn Internet meme may stay the same or may evolve over time, by chance or through commentary, imitations, [[parody]], or by incorporating news accounts about itself.

This was then adapted to other situations, such as baby boomers blaming millennials for problems that they allegedly caused.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Mary von Aue |title=Meme About 'Who Killed Hannibal' Is Reddit's Current Obsession |website=Inverse|access-date=May 19, 2018 |date=April 19, 2018 |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/43903-who-killed-hannibal-reddit-meme|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180519120857/https://www.inverse.com/article/43903-who-killed-hannibal-reddit-meme|archive-date=May 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Moth memes}}\nDank memes can also stem from interesting real-life images that get shared or remixed many times.

These moth memes usually revolved around the moth wanting to find a [[Light fixture|lamp]].

The section provides that if a copyrighted work is reproduced for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research, it would not amount to infringement. Notably for memes, the use of the term ''\"such as\"'' in the section denotes that the list is not exhaustive but merely illustrative. Furthermore, the factors mentioned in the section are subjective in nature and the weight of each factor varies on a case to case basis.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal |last1=Patel |first1=Ronak |title=First World Problems:' A Fair Use Analysis of Internet Memes |url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt96h003jt/qt96h003jt.pdf?t=nndf5x&v=lg |journal=UCLA Entertainment Law Review |volume=20 |issue=2}}</ref> All the factors have to be weighed together and an overall assessment is made whether the infringing work would qualify as fair use.\n\nThe four factors are:\n#The purpose or character of use,\n#The nature of the copyrighted work,\n#The amount and substantiality of the portion used, and\n#Effect on the market.\n\nThe purpose and character of the use involve how the original copyrighted work's purpose differs from the meme's purpose, as well as commercial uses of products that use copyrighted material. In [[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]] the court introduced the concept of [[Transformation (law)|transformation]] which goes into the inquiry whether the infringing work altered the original with a new expression, meaning or expression or merely superseded or supplanted the original work. Memes are ''transformative'' in nature as they have no relation to the original work and the motive behind the communication of the meme is personal, in terms of disseminating humour to the public. Such memes being transformative would be covered by fair use.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, copying memes that are made for the sole purpose of being memes would not enjoy this protection as there is no transformation- the copying has the same purpose as original meme which is communicate humorous anecdotes.<ref name=\"barandbench.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://barandbench.com/viewpoint-memes-copyright-got |title=The Viewpoint- Game of Thrones Memes: Potential Copyright Infringement or Fair Use? |last1=Mishra |first1=Meghna |last2=Nigam |first2=Anusuya |website=Bar and Bench|access-date=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPurpose and character of use weighs in against memes which have been used for commercial purposes because then the work has not been created for the communication of humour but for economic gain. For example, [[Grumpy Cat]] won $710,001 in a copyright lawsuit against the beverage company Grenade which used the Grumpy Cat image on its roasted coffee line and t-shirts.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thewrap.com/grumpy-cat-wins-710001-in-copyright-lawsuit-memes-have-rights-too/ |title=Grumpy Cat Wins $710,001 in Copyright Lawsuit: 'Memes Have Rights Too' |last1=Nakamura |first1=Reid |publisher=The Wrap|access-date=May 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422040921/https://www.thewrap.com/grumpy-cat-wins-710001-in-copyright-lawsuit-memes-have-rights-too/|archive-date=April 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe nature of the copyrighted work weighs asks what the differences between the meme and the other material are. This factor applies to many types of memes because the original work is an artistic creation that has been published and thus the latter enjoys protection under copyright which the memes are violating. However, as memes are transformative, this factor does not have a lot of weight.<ref name=\"lawandarts.org\"/>\n\nThe amount and substantiality of the portion used tests not only the quantity of the work copied but the quality that is copied as well.<ref name=\"SCOTUS\">{{Ussc|name=Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises|471|539|1985}}. {{Usgovpd}}</ref> [[Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises]] clarified this position. For cinematograph still, only a small portion of the entire film is copied whereas for rage comics and personal photographs, the entire portion has been used to create the meme. Despite this, all categories of memes would be considered to be falling under fair use because the text that is added to those images adds value, without which it would just be picture.<ref name=\":2\" /> Moreover, the heart of the work is not affected because the still/picture is taken out of context and portrays something entirely different from what the image originally wanted to depict.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=M.

The analysis requires three steps: the amount and substantiality of dealing, the purpose of copying, and the effect on potential markets.\n\nThe amount of sustainability of dealing asks about how much of the original work is used in the meme, or how the meme transforms the original content. A meme makes use to existing copyright work whether it is a cinematograph still, rage comic, personal photograph or a meme made for the purpose of being a meme. However, since a meme is made for comedic purposes, taken out of context of the original work, they are transforming the work and creating a new work.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe purpose of copying factors in the purpose of the meme compared to the purpose of the original work. Under Section 52(1)(a)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/1367?view_type=browse#collapse14572 |title=The Copyright Act, 1957}}</ref> the purpose is restricted to criticism or review. A meme, as long as it is a parody or a criticism of the original work would be protected under the exception but once an element of commercialization comes in, they would no longer be exempted and because the purpose no longer falls under the those mentioned in the section .<ref name=\":1\" /> When the Indian comedic group, [[All India Bakchod]] (AIB) parodied [[Game of Thrones]] through a series of memes, the primary purpose was to advertise products of companies that have endorsed the group and it would not be fair dealing.<ref name=\"barandbench.com\"/>\n\nMemes generally do not have an effect on the potential market for a work.

However, in more recent times, memes have evolved from simple image macros with text to more elaborate forms such as challenges, [[GIF]]s and [[Viral phenomenon|viral sensations]]. These small movements tend to spread from person to person via [[social network]]s, [[blog]]s, direct [[email]], or news sources. They may relate to various existing [[Internet culture]]s or [[subculture]]s, often created or spread on various websites. Fads and sensations tend to grow rapidly on the Internet, because the instant communication facilitates [[word of mouth]] transmission. Examples of such fads include posting a photo of people lying down in public places (called \"[[planking (fad)|planking]]\") and uploading a short video of people doing the [[Harlem Shake (meme)|Harlem Shake]]. \u201cDank\u201d memes have emerged as a new form of image-macros, defined by the inclusion of more surreal and nonsensical themes.\n\nThe word ''meme'' was coined by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' as an attempt to explain how ideas replicate, mutate and evolve ([[memetics]]).<ref name=\"cream\">{{Citation |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |edition=2 |isbn=978-0-19-286092-7 |page=192 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkHO9HI7koEC&pg=PA192 |quote=We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of ''imitation''.

He further referred to reproduction as \u201cparodies, remixes, or mashups\u201d (p.&nbsp;2) and listed a number of examples including, \u201c''Hitler\u2019s Downfall'' Parodies,\u201d [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hitlers-downfall-parodies] and \u201c''[[Nyan Cat]]'',\u201d among others. For the second attribute, he pointed out an example of a collision of Korean culture \"[[Gangnam Style in popular culture|Gangnam style]]\" and \u201c[[binders full of women]],\u201d a 2012 Mitt Romney presidential debate's assertion, in [[Psy]]\u2019s meme with \u201cmy binders full of women\u201d written on it.

[[Internet forum|Messageboards]] and [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroups]] were also popular because they allowed a simple method for people to share information or memes with a diverse population of Internet users in a short period. They encourage communication between people, and thus between meme sets, that do not normally come in contact. Furthermore, they actively promote meme-sharing within the messageboard or newsgroup population by asking for feedback, comments, opinions, etc. This format is what gave rise to early Internet memes, like the [[The Hampsterdance Song|Hampster Dance]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grunge.com/184711/the-oldest-memes-on-the-internet/|title=The oldest memes on the internet|last=Cantrell|first=Asher|date=2020-01-22|website=Grunge.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> Another factor in the increased meme transmission observed over the Internet is its interactive nature. [[Publishing|Print]] matter, [[radio]], and [[television]] are all essentially passive experiences requiring the reader, listener, or viewer to perform all necessary cognitive processing; in contrast, the social nature of the Internet allows phenomena to propagate more readily. Many phenomena are also spread via [[web search engine]]s, [[Internet forum]]s, [[social networking service]]s, [[Social news website|social news]] sites, and [[video hosting service]]s. Much of the Internet's ability to spread information is assisted from results found through search engines, which can allow users to find memes even with obscure information.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Memes On the Internet |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C004367/ce7.shtml |publisher=[[Oracle Thinkquest]] |access-date=November 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511193449/http://library.thinkquest.org/C004367/ce7.shtml |archivedate=May 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Marshall |first=Garry |title=The Internet and Memetics |url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Conf/MemePap/Marshall.html |publisher=School of Computing Science, [[Middlesex University]]|access-date=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119134239/http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Conf/MemePap/Marshall.html|archive-date=January 19, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe earlier forms of image based memes include the demotivator, image macro, photoshopped image, LOLCats, advice animal, and comic.<ref name=\":0222\">{{Cite book|last=Denisova, Anastasia,|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1090540034|title=Internet memes and society : social, cultural, and political contexts|isbn=978-0-429-46940-4|location=New York, NY|oclc=1090540034}}</ref> The Demotivator image includes a black background with white, capitalized, text.

At the time, memes were just short clips that were shared between people in [[Usenet]] forums. As the Internet evolved, so did memes. When [[YouTube]] was released in 2005, video memes became popular. Around this time, [[rickrolling]] became popular and the link to this video was sent around via email or other messaging sites. Video sharing also created memes such as \"[[Turn Down for What]]\" and the \"[[Harlem Shake (meme)|Harlem Shake]]\". As social media websites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] started appearing, it was now easy to share [[GIF]]s and [[image macro]]s to a large audience. Meme generator websites were created to let users create their own memes out of existing templates. Memes during this time could remain popular for a long time, from a few months to a decade, which contrasts with the fast lifespan of modern memes.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/story/guide-memes/ |title=The WIRED Guide to Memes |journal=WIRED|access-date=November 30, 2018 |first1=Angela |last1=Watercutter |first2=Emma |last2=Grey Ellisby |date=April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201164321/https://www.wired.com/story/guide-memes/|archive-date=February 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAn Internet meme may stay the same or may evolve over time, by chance or through commentary, imitations, [[parody]], or by incorporating news accounts about itself. Internet memes can evolve and spread extremely rapidly, sometimes reaching worldwide popularity within a few days.

The section provides that if a copyrighted work is reproduced for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research, it would not amount to infringement. Notably for memes, the use of the term ''\"such as\"'' in the section denotes that the list is not exhaustive but merely illustrative. Furthermore, the factors mentioned in the section are subjective in nature and the weight of each factor varies on a case to case basis.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal |last1=Patel |first1=Ronak |title=First World Problems:' A Fair Use Analysis of Internet Memes |url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt96h003jt/qt96h003jt.pdf?t=nndf5x&v=lg |journal=UCLA Entertainment Law Review |volume=20 |issue=2}}</ref> All the factors have to be weighed together and an overall assessment is made whether the infringing work would qualify as fair use.\n\nThe four factors are:\n#The purpose or character of use,\n#The nature of the copyrighted work,\n#The amount and substantiality of the portion used, and\n#Effect on the market.\n\nThe purpose and character of the use involve how the original copyrighted work's purpose differs from the meme's purpose, as well as commercial uses of products that use copyrighted material. In [[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]] the court introduced the concept of [[Transformation (law)|transformation]] which goes into the inquiry whether the infringing work altered the original with a new expression, meaning or expression or merely superseded or supplanted the original work. Memes are ''transformative'' in nature as they have no relation to the original work and the motive behind the communication of the meme is personal, in terms of disseminating humour to the public. Such memes being transformative would be covered by fair use.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, copying memes that are made for the sole purpose of being memes would not enjoy this protection as there is no transformation- the copying has the same purpose as original meme which is communicate humorous anecdotes.<ref name=\"barandbench.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://barandbench.com/viewpoint-memes-copyright-got |title=The Viewpoint- Game of Thrones Memes: Potential Copyright Infringement or Fair Use? |last1=Mishra |first1=Meghna |last2=Nigam |first2=Anusuya |website=Bar and Bench|access-date=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPurpose and character of use weighs in against memes which have been used for commercial purposes because then the work has not been created for the communication of humour but for economic gain. For example, [[Grumpy Cat]] won $710,001 in a copyright lawsuit against the beverage company Grenade which used the Grumpy Cat image on its roasted coffee line and t-shirts.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thewrap.com/grumpy-cat-wins-710001-in-copyright-lawsuit-memes-have-rights-too/ |title=Grumpy Cat Wins $710,001 in Copyright Lawsuit: 'Memes Have Rights Too' |last1=Nakamura |first1=Reid |publisher=The Wrap|access-date=May 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422040921/https://www.thewrap.com/grumpy-cat-wins-710001-in-copyright-lawsuit-memes-have-rights-too/|archive-date=April 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe nature of the copyrighted work weighs asks what the differences between the meme and the other material are. This factor applies to many types of memes because the original work is an artistic creation that has been published and thus the latter enjoys protection under copyright which the memes are violating. However, as memes are transformative, this factor does not have a lot of weight.<ref name=\"lawandarts.org\"/>\n\nThe amount and substantiality of the portion used tests not only the quantity of the work copied but the quality that is copied as well.<ref name=\"SCOTUS\">{{Ussc|name=Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises|471|539|1985}}. {{Usgovpd}}</ref> [[Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises]] clarified this position. For cinematograph still, only a small portion of the entire film is copied whereas for rage comics and personal photographs, the entire portion has been used to create the meme. Despite this, all categories of memes would be considered to be falling under fair use because the text that is added to those images adds value, without which it would just be picture.<ref name=\":2\" /> Moreover, the heart of the work is not affected because the still/picture is taken out of context and portrays something entirely different from what the image originally wanted to depict.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=M.

Warner Brothers was sued for infringing the [[Nyan Cat]] meme by using it its game Scribblenauts.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2013/05/03/warner-brothers-sued-for-infringing-cat-meme-copyright/#24bc370d2e34 |title=Warner Brothers Sued For Infringing Cat Meme Copyright |last1=Woollacott |first1=Emma |work=Forbes|access-date=May 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422040933/https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2013/05/03/warner-brothers-sued-for-infringing-cat-meme-copyright/#24bc370d2e34|archive-date=April 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Fair dealing in India ====\n{{Main|Fair dealing}}\n\nAny distribution of a work which has a copyright, wholly or partly, would constitute an infringing copy under Section 2(m)(i)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/1367?view_type=browse#collapse14504 |title=The Copyright Act, 1957}}</ref> of the Copyright Act, 1957. India follows a [[Fair dealing|Fair Dealing]] approach as an exception to copyright infringement under Section 52(1)(a)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/1367?view_type=browse#collapse14572 |title=The Copyright Act, 1957}}</ref> for the purposes of private or personal use, criticism or review. The analysis requires three steps: the amount and substantiality of dealing, the purpose of copying, and the effect on potential markets.\n\nThe amount of sustainability of dealing asks about how much of the original work is used in the meme, or how the meme transforms the original content. A meme makes use to existing copyright work whether it is a cinematograph still, rage comic, personal photograph or a meme made for the purpose of being a meme. However, since a meme is made for comedic purposes, taken out of context of the original work, they are transforming the work and creating a new work.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe purpose of copying factors in the purpose of the meme compared to the purpose of the original work. Under Section 52(1)(a)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/1367?view_type=browse#collapse14572 |title=The Copyright Act, 1957}}</ref> the purpose is restricted to criticism or review. A meme, as long as it is a parody or a criticism of the original work would be protected under the exception but once an element of commercialization comes in, they would no longer be exempted and because the purpose no longer falls under the those mentioned in the section .<ref name=\":1\" /> When the Indian comedic group, [[All India Bakchod]] (AIB) parodied [[Game of Thrones]] through a series of memes, the primary purpose was to advertise products of companies that have endorsed the group and it would not be fair dealing.<ref name=\"barandbench.com\"/>\n\nMemes generally do not have an effect on the potential market for a work. There must be no intention on part of the infringer to compete with the original owner of the work and derive profits from it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1685540/ |title=Blackwood & Sons Ltd. v.

The [[International Secretariat of Stone Masons]], the [[International Secretariat of Painters and Allied Trades]] and the [[International Secretariat of Bricklayers]] later joined the organisation. {{As of|2005}}, it had 287 member organisations in 124 countries, representing a combined membership of more than 10 million workers.\n\nThe IFBWW was based in [[Geneva]] and had a network of regional offices. The organisation worked closely with the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC) and the other global union federations, and had Special Consultative Status at the [[UN Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Committee]] of the [[United Nations]].\n\nThe IFBWW held a congress every four years, consisting of delegates from the member organisations. The congress established priorities and strategy for the organisation, and elected the Executive Committee. which met immediately before and after the congress, and at the midpoint of the congress period. As supreme governing body during the intercongress period, it was responsible for all policies and operations of the IFBWW. The Executive Committee appointed a Management Committee, which was responsible for the administration of the IFBWW and for the implementation of its policies.\n\nAt its congress in Buenos Aires on 9 December 2005 the IFBWW merged with the [[World Federation of Building and Wood Workers]] (WFBW) to create a new joint global union federation, the [[Building and Wood Workers' International]].\n\n==Affiliates==\nAs of 2005, the following unions were affiliated to the federation:<ref>{{cite web |title=Affiliates |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009190502/http://www.ifbww.org/index.cfm?n=161&l=2&t=f&t_id=-1 |website=International Federation of Building and Wood Workers |accessdate=9 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The [[International Secretariat of Stone Masons]], the [[International Secretariat of Painters and Allied Trades]] and the [[International Secretariat of Bricklayers]] later joined the organisation. {{As of|2005}}, it had 287 member organisations in 124 countries, representing a combined membership of more than 10 million workers.\n\nThe IFBWW was based in [[Geneva]] and had a network of regional offices. The organisation worked closely with the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC) and the other global union federations, and had Special Consultative Status at the [[UN Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Committee]] of the [[United Nations]].\n\nThe IFBWW held a congress every four years, consisting of delegates from the member organisations. The congress established priorities and strategy for the organisation, and elected the Executive Committee. which met immediately before and after the congress, and at the midpoint of the congress period. As supreme governing body during the intercongress period, it was responsible for all policies and operations of the IFBWW. The Executive Committee appointed a Management Committee, which was responsible for the administration of the IFBWW and for the implementation of its policies.\n\nAt its congress in Buenos Aires on 9 December 2005 the IFBWW merged with the [[World Federation of Building and Wood Workers]] (WFBW) to create a new joint global union federation, the [[Building and Wood Workers' International]].\n\n==Affiliates==\nAs of 2005, the following unions were affiliated to the federation:<ref>{{cite web |title=Affiliates |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009190502/http://www.ifbww.org/index.cfm?n=161&l=2&t=f&t_id=-1 |website=International Federation of Building and Wood Workers |accessdate=9 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

He has argued cases throughout the country involving [[constitutional]], [[criminal]], [[copyright]], and [[intellectual property]] law. He has appeared before the [[United States Supreme Court]], as well as trial and appellate courts throughout the United States. He has argued and written briefs that have been submitted to the United States Supreme Court; a number of which have resulted in changes in the law on a nationwide basis, including one described by Justice William Brennan as \"probably the most important due process case in the Twentieth Century\". An international observer in foreign elections, he was selected by [[President of the United States|Pres]]. [[Jimmy Carter]] to observe and report on the elections in [[Venezuela]] and [[Nicaragua]]. Garbus also participated in drafting several constitutions and foreign laws, including the Czechoslovak constitution. He also has been involved in prisoner exchange negotiations between governments. He is the author of six books and over 30 articles in The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times. ''[[Shouting Fire: Stories from the Edge of Free Speech|Shouting Fire]]'' is an award-winning documentary film about his life and career.

The animal has a curved [[snout]], long rectangular ears, a thin forked tail and [[Canidae|canine]] body, with sprouted fur tufts in an inverted arrow shape; sometimes, Set is depicted as a human with the distinctive head. Some early Egyptologists proposed that it was a stylised representation of the [[giraffe]], owing to the large flat-topped \"horns\" which correspond to a giraffe's [[ossicone]]s. The Egyptians themselves, however, made a distinction between the giraffe and the Set animal. During the Late Period, Set is depicted as a donkey or as having a donkey's head.{{sfn|te Velde |1967 |pp=13\u201315}}\n\nThe earliest representations of what might be the Set animal comes from a tomb dating to the [[Amratian culture]] (\"Naqada I\") of [[prehistoric Egypt]] (3790 BC\u20133500 BC), though this identification is uncertain. If these are ruled out, then the earliest Set animal appears on a [[ceremonial mace]]head of [[Scorpion II]], a ruler of the [[Naqada III]] phase. The head and the forked tail of the Set animal are clearly present.{{sfn|te Velde |1967 |pp=7\u201312}}\n\n==Conflict of Horus and Set==\nA major element of Set's mythology was his conflict with his brother or nephew, [[Horus]], for the throne of Egypt. The contest between them is often violent but is also described as a legal judgment before the [[Ennead]], an assembled group of Egyptian deities, to decide who should [[royal succession|inherit]] the kingship. The judge in this trial may be Geb, who, as the father of Osiris and Set, held the throne before they did, or it may be the creator gods Ra or Atum, the originators of kingship.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1960|pp=58\u201359}}</ref> Other deities also take important roles: Thoth frequently acts as a conciliator in the dispute<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1960|p=82}}</ref> or as an assistant to the divine judge, and in \"Contendings\", Isis uses her cunning and magical power to aid her son.<ref>{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|pp=135, 139\u2013140}}</ref>\n\nThe rivalry of Horus and Set is portrayed in two contrasting ways. Both perspectives appear as early as the ''Pyramid Texts'', the earliest source of the myth. In some spells from these texts, Horus is the son of Osiris and nephew of Set, and the murder of Osiris is the major impetus for the conflict. The other tradition depicts Horus and Set as brothers.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1960|pp=12\u201316}}</ref> This incongruity persists in many of the subsequent sources, where the two gods may be called brothers or uncle and nephew at different points in the same text.<ref name=\"Assmann 134\">{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|pp=134\u2013135}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Edfu47.JPG|thumb|right|Horus spears Set, who appears in the form of a hippopotamus, as Isis looks on]]\nThe divine struggle involves many episodes. \"Contendings\" describes the two gods appealing to various other deities to arbitrate the dispute and competing in different types of contests, such as racing in boats or fighting each other in the form of hippopotami, to determine a victor. In this account, Horus repeatedly defeats Set and is supported by most of the other deities.<ref>{{harvnb|Lichtheim|2006b|pp=214\u2013223}}</ref> Yet the dispute drags on for eighty years, largely because the judge, the creator god, favors Set.<ref>{{harvnb|Hart|2005|p=73}}</ref> In late ritual texts, the conflict is characterized as a great battle involving the two deities' assembled followers.<ref>{{harvnb|Pinch|2004|p=83}}</ref> The strife in the divine realm extends beyond the two combatants. At one point Isis attempts to harpoon Set as he is locked in combat with her son, but she strikes Horus instead, who then cuts off her head in a fit of rage.<ref>{{harvnb|Lichtheim|2006b|pp=218\u2013219}}</ref> Thoth replaces Isis's head with that of a cow; the story gives a [[origin myth|mythical origin]] for the cow-horn headdress that Isis commonly wears.<ref>Griffiths, J. Gwyn, \"Osiris\", in {{harvnb|Redford|2001|loc=vol. II|pp=188\u2013190}}</ref>\n\nIn a key episode in the conflict, Set sexually abuses Horus. Set's violation is partly meant to degrade his rival, but it also involves homosexual desire, in keeping with one of Set's major characteristics, his forceful, potent, and indiscriminate sexuality.<ref>{{harvnb|te Velde|1967|pp=55\u201356, 65}}</ref> In the earliest account of this episode, in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual encounter begins when Set asks to have sex with Horus, who agrees on the condition that Set will give Horus some of his strength.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1960|p=42}}</ref> The encounter puts Horus in danger, because in Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance, akin to poison. According to some texts, Set's semen enters Horus's body and makes him ill, but in \"Contendings\", Horus thwarts Set by catching Set's semen in his hands. Isis retaliates by putting Horus's semen on lettuce-leaves that Set eats. Set's defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He has been impregnated with his rival's seed and as a result \"gives birth\" to the disk. In \"Contendings\", Thoth takes the disk and places it on his own head; in earlier accounts, it is Thoth who is produced by this anomalous birth.<ref>{{harvnb|te Velde|1967|pp=38\u201339, 43\u201344}}</ref>\n\nAnother important episode concerns mutilations that the combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes the eye is torn into pieces.<ref name=\"Pinch 82\">{{harvnb|Pinch|2004|pp=82\u201383, 91}}</ref> Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength.<ref>{{harvnb|te Velde|1967|pp=42\u201343}}</ref> The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen [[Eye of Horus]] represents a wide variety of concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during [[lunar eclipse|eclipses]]. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him.<ref name=\"Pinch 82\"/> The Egyptologist [[Herman te Velde]] argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge in the form of the Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.<ref>{{harvnb|te Velde|1967|pp=43\u201346, 58}}</ref>\n\nIn any case, the restoration of the Eye of Horus to wholeness represents the return of the moon to full brightness,<ref>Kaper, Olaf E., \"Myths: Lunar Cycle\", in {{harvnb|Redford|2001|loc=vol. II|pp=480\u2013482}}</ref> the return of the kingship to Horus,<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1960|p=29}}</ref> and many other aspects of ''[[maat]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Pinch|2004|p=131}}</ref> Sometimes the restoration of Horus's eye is accompanied by the restoration of Set's testicles, so that both gods are made whole near the conclusion of their feud.<ref>{{harvnb|te Velde|1967|pp=56\u201357}}</ref>\n\n==Protector of Ra==\n[[File:Set speared Apep.jpg|thumb|Set [[spear]]s [[Apep]].]]\nSet was depicted standing on the prow of [[Ra]]'s [[Atet|barge]] defeating the dark [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] [[Apep]]. In some [[Late Period of Egypt|Late Period]] representations, such as in the [[Twenty-seventh dynasty of Egypt|Persian Period]] [[Temple of Hibis]] at [[Kharga Oasis|Khargah]], Set was represented in this role with a [[falcon]]'s head, taking on the guise of [[Horus]]. In the ''[[Amduat]]'' Set is described as having a key role in overcoming [[Apep]].\n\n==Set in the Second Intermediate and Ramesside Periods==\n[[File:SethAndHorusAdoringRamsses crop.jpg|thumb|Set and [[Horus]] adore Ramesses in the small temple at [[Abu Simbel]].]]\nDuring the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] (1650\u20131550&nbsp;BCE), a group of Near Eastern peoples, known as the ''[[Hyksos]]'' (literally, \"''rulers of foreign lands''\") gained control of Lower Egypt, and ruled the [[Nile Delta]], from [[Avaris]]. They chose Set, originally Upper Egypt's chief god, the god of foreigners and the god they found most similar to their own chief god, [[Hadad]], as their patron. Set then became worshiped as the chief god once again. The Hyksos King [[Apepi (pharaoh)|Apophis]] is recorded as worshiping Set [[Monolatrism|exclusively]], as described in the following passage:\n{{quote|text=[He] chose for his Lord the god Seth. He did not worship any other deity in the whole land except Seth.|author=''Papyrus Sallier&nbsp;1 (Apophis and Sekenenre)''<ref>{{cite book |title=Papyrus Sallier&nbsp;1 (Apophis and Sekenenre) |at=1.2\u20133 |editor-last=Gardiner |year=1932}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Jan Assmann]] argues that because the ancient Egyptians could never conceive of a \"lonely\" god lacking personality, Seth the desert god, who was worshiped on his own, represented a manifestation of evil.<ref>{{cite book |title=Of God and Gods: Egypt, Israel, and the rise of monotheism |first=Jan |last=Assmann |pages=47\u201348 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-299-22550-6}}</ref>\n\nWhen, c.&nbsp;1522&nbsp;BCE, [[Ahmose I]] overthrew the Hyksos and expelled them, Egyptians' attitudes towards Asiatic foreigners became [[xenophobia|xenophobic]], and royal propaganda discredited the period of Hyksos rule. The Set cult at Avaris flourished, nevertheless, and the Egyptian garrison of Ahmose stationed there became part of the priesthood of Set.\n\nThe founder of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]], [[Ramesses I]] came from a military family from Avaris with strong ties to the priesthood of Set. Several of the Ramesside kings were named after the god, most notably [[Seti I|Seti&nbsp;I]] (literally, \"''man of Set''\") and [[Setnakht]] (literally, \"''Set is strong''\"). In addition, one of the garrisons of [[Ramesses II|Ramesses&nbsp;II]] held Set as its patron deity, and Ramesses&nbsp;II erected the so-called \"''Four Hundred Years' Stele''\" at [[Pi-Ramesses]], commemorating the 400th anniversary of the Set cult in the Nile delta.\n\nSet also became associated with foreign gods during the [[New Kingdom]], particularly in the delta. Set was also identified by the Egyptians with the [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] deity [[Teshub]], who, like Set, was a storm god.\n\n==Demonization of Set==\n[[File:Relief Herihor Seth obliterated.jpg|thumb|140px|Set on a late New Kingdom relief from Karnak: his figure was erased during his demonization.]]\nAccording to Herman te Velde, the demonization of Set took place after Egypt's conquest by several foreign nations in the [[Third Intermediate Period|Third Intermediate]] and [[Late Period of Ancient Egypt|Late Periods]]. Set, who had traditionally been the god of foreigners, thus also became associated with foreign oppressors, including the [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] empires.{{sfn|te Velde |1967 |pp=138\u2013140}} It was during this time that Set was particularly vilified, and his defeat by Horus widely celebrated.\n\nSet's negative aspects were emphasized during this period. Set was the killer of Osiris, having hacked Osiris' body into pieces and dispersed it so that he could not be [[resurrection|resurrected]]. The Greeks would later associate Set with [[Typhon]], a monstrous and evil force of raging nature. Both were sons of deities representing the Earth ([[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and Geb) who attacked the principal deities (Osiris for Set, [[Zeus]] for Typhon).\n\nNevertheless, throughout this period, in some outlying regions of Egypt, Set was still regarded as the heroic chief deity.\n\n==Temples==\nSet was worshipped at the [[Egyptian temple|temples]] of [[Ombos]] (Nubt near Naqada) and Ombos (Nubt near [[Kom Ombo]]), at Oxyrhynchus in upper Egypt, and also in part of the [[Fayyum]] area.\n\nMore specifically, Set was worshipped in the relatively large metropolitan (yet provincial) locale of [[Sepermeru]], especially during the Ramesside Period.<ref>cf. Sauneron, Priests of Ancient Egypt, p. 181</ref> There, Seth was honored with an important temple called the \"House of Seth, Lord of Sepermeru\". One of the epithets of this town was \"gateway to the desert\", which fits well with Set's role as a deity of the frontier regions of ancient Egypt. At Sepermeru, Set's temple enclosure included a small secondary shrine called \"The House of Seth, Powerful-Is-His-Mighty-Arm\", and Ramesses II himself built (or modified) a second land-owning temple for Nephthys, called \"The House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun\".{{sfn|Katary|1989|p=216}}\n\nThe two temples of Seth and Nephthys in Sepermeru were under separate administration, each with its own holdings and prophets.{{sfn|Katary|1989|p=220}} Moreover, another moderately sized temple of Seth is noted for the nearby town of Pi-Wayna.{{sfn|Katary|1989|p=216}} The close association of Seth temples with temples of Nephthys in key outskirt-towns of this ''milieu'' is also reflected in the likelihood that there existed another \"House of Seth\" and another \"House of Nephthys\" in the town of Su, at the entrance to the Fayyum.<ref>Gardiner, Papyrus Wilbour Commentary, S28, pp. 127\u2013128</ref>\n\n[[Papyrus Bologna]] preserves a most irritable complaint lodged by one Pra'em-hab, Prophet of the \"House of Seth\" in the now-lost town of Punodjem (\"The Sweet Place\"). In the text of Papyrus Bologna, the harried Pra'em-hab laments undue taxation for his own temple (The House of Seth) and goes on to lament that he is also saddled with responsibility for: \"the ship, and I am likewise also responsible for the House of Nephthys, along with the remaining heap of district temples\".<ref>Papyrus Bologna 1094, 5,8\u20137, 1</ref>\n\nNothing is known about the particular theologies of the closely connected Set and Nephthys temples in these districts\u2014for example, the religious tone of temples of Nephthys located in such proximity to those of Seth, especially given the seemingly contrary Osirian loyalties of Seth's consort-goddess. When, by the [[Twentieth Dynasty]], the \"demonization\" of Seth was ostensibly inaugurated, Seth was either eradicated or increasingly pushed to the outskirts, Nephthys flourished as part of the usual Osirian pantheon throughout Egypt, even obtaining a Late Period status as tutelary goddess of her own Nome (UU Nome VII, \"Hwt-Sekhem\"/Diospolis Parva) and as the chief goddess of the Mansion of the Sistrum in that district.<ref>Sauneron, Beitrage Bf. 6, 46</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Le temple d'El-Qal'a.

The animal has a curved [[snout]], long rectangular ears, a thin forked tail and [[Canidae|canine]] body, with sprouted fur tufts in an inverted arrow shape; sometimes, Set is depicted as a human with the distinctive head. Some early Egyptologists proposed that it was a stylised representation of the [[giraffe]], owing to the large flat-topped \"horns\" which correspond to a giraffe's [[ossicone]]s. The Egyptians themselves, however, made a distinction between the giraffe and the Set animal. During the Late Period, Set is depicted as a donkey or as having a donkey's head.{{sfn|te Velde |1967 |pp=13\u201315}}\n\nThe earliest representations of what might be the Set animal comes from a tomb dating to the [[Amratian culture]] (\"Naqada I\") of [[prehistoric Egypt]] (3790 BC\u20133500 BC), though this identification is uncertain. If these are ruled out, then the earliest Set animal appears on a [[ceremonial mace]]head of [[Scorpion II]], a ruler of the [[Naqada III]] phase. The head and the forked tail of the Set animal are clearly present.{{sfn|te Velde |1967 |pp=7\u201312}}\n\n==Conflict of Horus and Set==\nA major element of Set's mythology was his conflict with his brother or nephew, [[Horus]], for the throne of Egypt. The contest between them is often violent but is also described as a legal judgment before the [[Ennead]], an assembled group of Egyptian deities, to decide who should [[royal succession|inherit]] the kingship. The judge in this trial may be Geb, who, as the father of Osiris and Set, held the throne before they did, or it may be the creator gods Ra or Atum, the originators of kingship.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1960|pp=58\u201359}}</ref> Other deities also take important roles: Thoth frequently acts as a conciliator in the dispute<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1960|p=82}}</ref> or as an assistant to the divine judge, and in \"Contendings\", Isis uses her cunning and magical power to aid her son.<ref>{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|pp=135, 139\u2013140}}</ref>\n\nThe rivalry of Horus and Set is portrayed in two contrasting ways. Both perspectives appear as early as the ''Pyramid Texts'', the earliest source of the myth. In some spells from these texts, Horus is the son of Osiris and nephew of Set, and the murder of Osiris is the major impetus for the conflict. The other tradition depicts Horus and Set as brothers.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1960|pp=12\u201316}}</ref> This incongruity persists in many of the subsequent sources, where the two gods may be called brothers or uncle and nephew at different points in the same text.<ref name=\"Assmann 134\">{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|pp=134\u2013135}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Edfu47.JPG|thumb|right|Horus spears Set, who appears in the form of a hippopotamus, as Isis looks on]]\nThe divine struggle involves many episodes. \"Contendings\" describes the two gods appealing to various other deities to arbitrate the dispute and competing in different types of contests, such as racing in boats or fighting each other in the form of hippopotami, to determine a victor. In this account, Horus repeatedly defeats Set and is supported by most of the other deities.<ref>{{harvnb|Lichtheim|2006b|pp=214\u2013223}}</ref> Yet the dispute drags on for eighty years, largely because the judge, the creator god, favors Set.<ref>{{harvnb|Hart|2005|p=73}}</ref> In late ritual texts, the conflict is characterized as a great battle involving the two deities' assembled followers.<ref>{{harvnb|Pinch|2004|p=83}}</ref> The strife in the divine realm extends beyond the two combatants. At one point Isis attempts to harpoon Set as he is locked in combat with her son, but she strikes Horus instead, who then cuts off her head in a fit of rage.<ref>{{harvnb|Lichtheim|2006b|pp=218\u2013219}}</ref> Thoth replaces Isis's head with that of a cow; the story gives a [[origin myth|mythical origin]] for the cow-horn headdress that Isis commonly wears.<ref>Griffiths, J. Gwyn, \"Osiris\", in {{harvnb|Redford|2001|loc=vol. II|pp=188\u2013190}}</ref>\n\nIn a key episode in the conflict, Set sexually abuses Horus. Set's violation is partly meant to degrade his rival, but it also involves homosexual desire, in keeping with one of Set's major characteristics, his forceful, potent, and indiscriminate sexuality.<ref>{{harvnb|te Velde|1967|pp=55\u201356, 65}}</ref> In the earliest account of this episode, in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual encounter begins when Set asks to have sex with Horus, who agrees on the condition that Set will give Horus some of his strength.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1960|p=42}}</ref> The encounter puts Horus in danger, because in Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance, akin to poison. According to some texts, Set's semen enters Horus's body and makes him ill, but in \"Contendings\", Horus thwarts Set by catching Set's semen in his hands. Isis retaliates by putting Horus's semen on lettuce-leaves that Set eats. Set's defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He has been impregnated with his rival's seed and as a result \"gives birth\" to the disk. In \"Contendings\", Thoth takes the disk and places it on his own head; in earlier accounts, it is Thoth who is produced by this anomalous birth.<ref>{{harvnb|te Velde|1967|pp=38\u201339, 43\u201344}}</ref>\n\nAnother important episode concerns mutilations that the combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes the eye is torn into pieces.<ref name=\"Pinch 82\">{{harvnb|Pinch|2004|pp=82\u201383, 91}}</ref> Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength.<ref>{{harvnb|te Velde|1967|pp=42\u201343}}</ref> The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen [[Eye of Horus]] represents a wide variety of concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during [[lunar eclipse|eclipses]]. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him.<ref name=\"Pinch 82\"/> The Egyptologist [[Herman te Velde]] argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge in the form of the Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.<ref>{{harvnb|te Velde|1967|pp=43\u201346, 58}}</ref>\n\nIn any case, the restoration of the Eye of Horus to wholeness represents the return of the moon to full brightness,<ref>Kaper, Olaf E., \"Myths: Lunar Cycle\", in {{harvnb|Redford|2001|loc=vol. II|pp=480\u2013482}}</ref> the return of the kingship to Horus,<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1960|p=29}}</ref> and many other aspects of ''[[maat]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Pinch|2004|p=131}}</ref> Sometimes the restoration of Horus's eye is accompanied by the restoration of Set's testicles, so that both gods are made whole near the conclusion of their feud.<ref>{{harvnb|te Velde|1967|pp=56\u201357}}</ref>\n\n==Protector of Ra==\n[[File:Set speared Apep.jpg|thumb|Set [[spear]]s [[Apep]].]]\nSet was depicted standing on the prow of [[Ra]]'s [[Atet|barge]] defeating the dark [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] [[Apep]]. In some [[Late Period of Egypt|Late Period]] representations, such as in the [[Twenty-seventh dynasty of Egypt|Persian Period]] [[Temple of Hibis]] at [[Kharga Oasis|Khargah]], Set was represented in this role with a [[falcon]]'s head, taking on the guise of [[Horus]]. In the ''[[Amduat]]'' Set is described as having a key role in overcoming [[Apep]].\n\n==Set in the Second Intermediate and Ramesside Periods==\n[[File:SethAndHorusAdoringRamsses crop.jpg|thumb|Set and [[Horus]] adore Ramesses in the small temple at [[Abu Simbel]].]]\nDuring the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] (1650\u20131550&nbsp;BCE), a group of Near Eastern peoples, known as the ''[[Hyksos]]'' (literally, \"''rulers of foreign lands''\") gained control of Lower Egypt, and ruled the [[Nile Delta]], from [[Avaris]]. They chose Set, originally Upper Egypt's chief god, the god of foreigners and the god they found most similar to their own chief god, [[Hadad]], as their patron. Set then became worshiped as the chief god once again. The Hyksos King [[Apepi (pharaoh)|Apophis]] is recorded as worshiping Set [[Monolatrism|exclusively]], as described in the following passage:\n{{quote|text=[He] chose for his Lord the god Seth. He did not worship any other deity in the whole land except Seth.|author=''Papyrus Sallier&nbsp;1 (Apophis and Sekenenre)''<ref>{{cite book |title=Papyrus Sallier&nbsp;1 (Apophis and Sekenenre) |at=1.2\u20133 |editor-last=Gardiner |year=1932}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Jan Assmann]] argues that because the ancient Egyptians could never conceive of a \"lonely\" god lacking personality, Seth the desert god, who was worshiped on his own, represented a manifestation of evil.<ref>{{cite book |title=Of God and Gods: Egypt, Israel, and the rise of monotheism |first=Jan |last=Assmann |pages=47\u201348 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-299-22550-6}}</ref>\n\nWhen, c.&nbsp;1522&nbsp;BCE, [[Ahmose I]] overthrew the Hyksos and expelled them, Egyptians' attitudes towards Asiatic foreigners became [[xenophobia|xenophobic]], and royal propaganda discredited the period of Hyksos rule. The Set cult at Avaris flourished, nevertheless, and the Egyptian garrison of Ahmose stationed there became part of the priesthood of Set.\n\nThe founder of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]], [[Ramesses I]] came from a military family from Avaris with strong ties to the priesthood of Set. Several of the Ramesside kings were named after the god, most notably [[Seti I|Seti&nbsp;I]] (literally, \"''man of Set''\") and [[Setnakht]] (literally, \"''Set is strong''\"). In addition, one of the garrisons of [[Ramesses II|Ramesses&nbsp;II]] held Set as its patron deity, and Ramesses&nbsp;II erected the so-called \"''Four Hundred Years' Stele''\" at [[Pi-Ramesses]], commemorating the 400th anniversary of the Set cult in the Nile delta.\n\nSet also became associated with foreign gods during the [[New Kingdom]], particularly in the delta. Set was also identified by the Egyptians with the [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] deity [[Teshub]], who, like Set, was a storm god.\n\n==Demonization of Set==\n[[File:Relief Herihor Seth obliterated.jpg|thumb|140px|Set on a late New Kingdom relief from Karnak: his figure was erased during his demonization.]]\nAccording to Herman te Velde, the demonization of Set took place after Egypt's conquest by several foreign nations in the [[Third Intermediate Period|Third Intermediate]] and [[Late Period of Ancient Egypt|Late Periods]]. Set, who had traditionally been the god of foreigners, thus also became associated with foreign oppressors, including the [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] empires.{{sfn|te Velde |1967 |pp=138\u2013140}} It was during this time that Set was particularly vilified, and his defeat by Horus widely celebrated.\n\nSet's negative aspects were emphasized during this period. Set was the killer of Osiris, having hacked Osiris' body into pieces and dispersed it so that he could not be [[resurrection|resurrected]]. The Greeks would later associate Set with [[Typhon]], a monstrous and evil force of raging nature. Both were sons of deities representing the Earth ([[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and Geb) who attacked the principal deities (Osiris for Set, [[Zeus]] for Typhon).\n\nNevertheless, throughout this period, in some outlying regions of Egypt, Set was still regarded as the heroic chief deity.\n\n==Temples==\nSet was worshipped at the [[Egyptian temple|temples]] of [[Ombos]] (Nubt near Naqada) and Ombos (Nubt near [[Kom Ombo]]), at Oxyrhynchus in upper Egypt, and also in part of the [[Fayyum]] area.\n\nMore specifically, Set was worshipped in the relatively large metropolitan (yet provincial) locale of [[Sepermeru]], especially during the Ramesside Period.<ref>cf. Sauneron, Priests of Ancient Egypt, p. 181</ref> There, Seth was honored with an important temple called the \"House of Seth, Lord of Sepermeru\". One of the epithets of this town was \"gateway to the desert\", which fits well with Set's role as a deity of the frontier regions of ancient Egypt. At Sepermeru, Set's temple enclosure included a small secondary shrine called \"The House of Seth, Powerful-Is-His-Mighty-Arm\", and Ramesses II himself built (or modified) a second land-owning temple for Nephthys, called \"The House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun\".{{sfn|Katary|1989|p=216}}\n\nThe two temples of Seth and Nephthys in Sepermeru were under separate administration, each with its own holdings and prophets.{{sfn|Katary|1989|p=220}} Moreover, another moderately sized temple of Seth is noted for the nearby town of Pi-Wayna.{{sfn|Katary|1989|p=216}} The close association of Seth temples with temples of Nephthys in key outskirt-towns of this ''milieu'' is also reflected in the likelihood that there existed another \"House of Seth\" and another \"House of Nephthys\" in the town of Su, at the entrance to the Fayyum.<ref>Gardiner, Papyrus Wilbour Commentary, S28, pp. 127\u2013128</ref>\n\n[[Papyrus Bologna]] preserves a most irritable complaint lodged by one Pra'em-hab, Prophet of the \"House of Seth\" in the now-lost town of Punodjem (\"The Sweet Place\"). In the text of Papyrus Bologna, the harried Pra'em-hab laments undue taxation for his own temple (The House of Seth) and goes on to lament that he is also saddled with responsibility for: \"the ship, and I am likewise also responsible for the House of Nephthys, along with the remaining heap of district temples\".<ref>Papyrus Bologna 1094, 5,8\u20137, 1</ref>\n\nNothing is known about the particular theologies of the closely connected Set and Nephthys temples in these districts\u2014for example, the religious tone of temples of Nephthys located in such proximity to those of Seth, especially given the seemingly contrary Osirian loyalties of Seth's consort-goddess. When, by the [[Twentieth Dynasty]], the \"demonization\" of Seth was ostensibly inaugurated, Seth was either eradicated or increasingly pushed to the outskirts, Nephthys flourished as part of the usual Osirian pantheon throughout Egypt, even obtaining a Late Period status as tutelary goddess of her own Nome (UU Nome VII, \"Hwt-Sekhem\"/Diospolis Parva) and as the chief goddess of the Mansion of the Sistrum in that district.<ref>Sauneron, Beitrage Bf. 6, 46</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Le temple d'El-Qal'a.

Meanwhile, Nephthys was also venerated as \"Mistress\" in the Osirian temples of these districts, as part of the specifically Osirian college.{{sfn|Kaper|1997b|pp=234\u2013237}} It would appear that the ancient Egyptians in these locales had little problem with the paradoxical dualities inherent in venerating Seth and Nephthys as juxtaposed against Osiris, Isis, and Nephthys.\n\n==In modern religion==\n{{main|Kemetism|Temple of Set|Sethian Liberation Movement}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian deities in popular culture#Set}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{noteslist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book|last=Allen |first=James P. |year=2004 |chapter=Theology, Theodicy, Philosophy: Egypt |editor=Sarah Iles Johnston |title=Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=978-0-674-01517-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bickel |first=Susanne |year=2004 |chapter=Myths and Sacred Narratives: Egypt |editor=Sarah Iles Johnston |title=Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn= 978-0-674-01517-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cohn |first= Norman |date= 1995 |title=Cosmos, Chaos and the World to Come: The Ancient Roots of Apocalyptic Faith |location= New Haven |publisher= [[Yale University Press]] |isbn=978-0-300-09088-8 |ref=harv}} (1999 paperback reprint)\n* {{cite book |last=Ions |first=Veronica |date=1982 |title=Egyptian Mythology |location=New York |publisher=Peter Bedrick Books |isbn=978-0-87226-249-2 |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/egyptianmytholog00vero_0 }}\n* {{cite thesis|last=Kaper |first=Olaf Ernst |date=1997a |title=Temples and Gods in Roman Dakhlah: Studies in the Indigenous Cults of an Egyptian Oasis |type=doctoral dissertation |location=Groningen |publisher=[[Rijksuniversiteit Groningen]], Faculteit der Letteren |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Kaper |first=Olaf Ernst |date=1997b |chapter=The Statue of Penbast: On the Cult of Seth in the Dakhlah Oasis |url=http://print.google.com/print?id=dv_2slpteq4C |title=Egyptological Memoirs, Essays on ancient Egypt in Honour of Herman Te Velde |editor=Jacobus van Dijk |series=Egyptological Memoirs 1 |location=Groningen |publisher=Styx Publications |pages=231\u2013241 |isbn=978-90-5693-014-1 |ref=harv }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* {{cite book|last=Katary |first=Sally L.
