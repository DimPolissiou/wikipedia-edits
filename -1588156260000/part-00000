more expensive|work=[[Ars Technica]]|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n==Specifications==\n===Design===\nAs with previous OnePlus phones, the 8 and 8 Pro use an anodized aluminum frame and curved [[Gorilla Glass]] on both the front and back. Both have a circular cutout in the upper-left hand corner for the front-facing camera; on the 8 Pro this replaces the pop-up camera used on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro. The camera module is similar to that of the 7 Pro and 7T Pro, protruding slightly from the back panel. On the 8, the dual-LED flash is located below, while on the 8 Pro, the telephoto camera, laser autofocus and dual-LED flash are all located to the left of the module. The 8 and 8 Pro are the first water-resistant OnePlus phones, rated at [[IP Code|IP68]]. All 8 Pro models have water resistance, although for the 8 it is present only on carrier models. Both will be available in Onyx Black (glossy) and Glacial Green (matte), while the 8 Pro has its own Ultramarine Blue (matte) finish. The 8 has two additional colors, a Polar Silver (matte) finish exclusive to the Verizon model,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> and an Interstellar Glow (glossy) finish exclusive to the T-Mobile model.\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth#Deep color (30/36/48-bit)|30-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera or autofocus on the ultrawide camera, which are now exclusive to the 8 Pro. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor.\n\n===Software===\nThe 8 and 8 Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]]. \n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n!5G\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|rowspan=\"2\"|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48 \n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n\nmmWave: 257, 258, 260, 261\n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n|}\nConnectivity options have been improved with the implementation of 5G technology for all models, however only the Verizon '''OnePlus 8 5G UW''' model will be compatible with ultra-fast millimeter-wave networks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-fastest-oneplus-8-5g-variant-is-an-exclusive-with-verizon/|title=The fastest OnePlus 8 5G variant is an exclusive with Verizon|work=[[CNET]]|last1=Cheng|first1=Roger|last2=Blumenthal|first2=Eli|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> Verizon and T-Mobile will sell the 8 but not the 8 Pro, however the 8 Pro will still work on their networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219152/oneplus-8-pro-buy-order-how-to-price-release-date-carriers|title=How to buy the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Faulkner|first=Cameron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nBoth the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro were met with generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the design, display, performance and battery life.

more expensive|work=[[Ars Technica]]|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n==Specifications==\n===Design===\nAs with previous OnePlus phones, the 8 and 8 Pro use an anodized aluminum frame and curved [[Gorilla Glass]] on both the front and back. Both have a circular cutout in the upper-left hand corner for the front-facing camera; on the 8 Pro this replaces the pop-up camera used on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro. The camera module is similar to that of the 7 Pro and 7T Pro, protruding slightly from the back panel. On the 8, the dual-LED flash is located below, while on the 8 Pro, the telephoto camera, laser autofocus and dual-LED flash are all located to the left of the module. The 8 and 8 Pro are the first water-resistant OnePlus phones, rated at [[IP Code|IP68]]. All 8 Pro models have water resistance, although for the 8 it is present only on carrier models. Both will be available in Onyx Black (glossy) and Glacial Green (matte), while the 8 Pro has its own Ultramarine Blue (matte) finish. The 8 has two additional colors, a Polar Silver (matte) finish exclusive to the Verizon model,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> and an Interstellar Glow (glossy) finish exclusive to the T-Mobile model.\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth#Deep color (30/36/48-bit)|30-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera or autofocus on the ultrawide camera, which are now exclusive to the 8 Pro. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor.\n\n===Software===\nThe 8 and 8 Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]]. \n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n!5G\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|rowspan=\"2\"|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48 \n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n\nmmWave: 257, 258, 260, 261\n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n|}\nConnectivity options have been improved with the implementation of 5G technology for all models, however only the Verizon '''OnePlus 8 5G UW''' model will be compatible with ultra-fast millimeter-wave networks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-fastest-oneplus-8-5g-variant-is-an-exclusive-with-verizon/|title=The fastest OnePlus 8 5G variant is an exclusive with Verizon|work=[[CNET]]|last1=Cheng|first1=Roger|last2=Blumenthal|first2=Eli|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> Verizon and T-Mobile will sell the 8 but not the 8 Pro, however the 8 Pro will still work on their networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219152/oneplus-8-pro-buy-order-how-to-price-release-date-carriers|title=How to buy the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Faulkner|first=Cameron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nBoth the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro were met with generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the design, display, performance and battery life.

It is a collaboration of 29 non-profit conservation organisations, both Australian and international. SOML was initially founded in 2008 to raise awareness of the need for the Australian Government to establish a network of large marine sanctuaries in the country's South West marine region.<ref>[http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/20090225912/business-briefing/uwa-ecologist-worldwide-campaign-protect-our-marine-life  University of Western Australia, \"UWA ecologist worldwide campaign to protect our marine life\", published 25 February 2009, retrieved 18 January 2010]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=49620 |title=Save Our Marine Life |date=23 February 2009 |access-date=2018-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506004539/http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=49620 |archive-date=2011-05-06 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2010 SOML became a national campaign in order to drive the completion of Australia's National Network of Marine Parks.\n\nAs a result of the SOML campaign and the long-standing Australian Government NRSMPA program (National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas) in 2012 the Gillard Labor Government declared 44 new federal marine parks in the South-west, North-west, North, Coral Sea and Temperate East marine regions, bringing Australia's federal marine park total to 60, covering a total area of 3.3million square kilometers (36% of Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)) - the largest marine parks network in the world.\n\nIn December 2013 the incoming Abbott Coalition Government suspended the operation of the 44 new parks before they could commence operation (which was scheduled for July 2014), and commenced an independent review. That review provided its findings to the then Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt in December 2015. The findings were released to the public in September 2016. Whilst endorsing the process undertaken by previous governments to develop the 44 marine parks, the Review recommended changes to zoning in a number of the new parks.\n\nIn September 2016 the Turnbull Coalition Government commenced a further public consultation process to develop new management plans for the marine parks in order to change the zoning. In March 2018 the revised management plans were tabled in the Australian Parliament for consideration. Changes to the original 2012 zoning in the parks included removal of almost half the high level protective green \u2018sanctuary\u2019 zoning across the network - an area almost twice the size of the state of Victoria and equivalent in area to the loss of half of Australia's national parks on land - the biggest single windback of conservation area in Australia's history.\n\nThe alliance groups include:\n* [[Australian Conservation Foundation]]\n* [[Australian Marine Conservation Society]]\n* [[Conservation Council of Western Australia]]\n* [[Cairns and Far North Environment Centre]]\n* [[Conservation Council of WA]]\n* [[Conservation Council of South Australia]]\n* [[Environment Centre of the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Environment Tasmania]]\n* [[Environment Victoria]]\n* [[Environs Kimberley]]\n* [[Greenpeace Asia Pacific]]\n* [[Humane Society International]]\n* [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]]\n* [[National Parks Association of NSW]]\n* [[National Parks Association of Qld]]\n* [[Nature Conservation Council of NSW]]\n* [[North Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Project AWARE|Project AWARE Foundation]]\n* [[Sealife Trust]]\n* [[Sea Shepherd]]\n* [[Surfrider]]\n* [[The Nature Conservancy]]\n* [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]]\n* [[The Wilderness Society (Australia)|The Wilderness Society]]\n* [[Victorian National Parks Association]]\n* [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society]]\n* [[Wildlife Preservation Council of Qld]]\n* [[World Wildlife Fund|World Wildlife Fund \u2013 Australia]]\n\n'''What's at stake'''\n\nMarine sanctuaries (green zones) are proven to work alongside sensible fisheries management to provide safe havens for fish and marine life to recover and rebuild. Sanctuaries have been shown to prevent local extinctions and help make coral reefs more resilient to the impacts of climate change.\n \nIn 2012, Australia made history by creating the world's largest network of marine sanctuaries \u2013 protecting our incredible marine life, safeguarding our enviable coastal lifestyle, and giving fish populations across Australia the chance to rebuild and thrive.\n\nThe creation of the national network crossed political divides and received bi-partisan political support.

It is one of the larger\u00a0rorqual\u00a0species, with adults ranging in length from 12\u201316\u00a0m (39\u201352\u00a0ft) and weighing around 25\u201330 metric tons (28\u201333 short tons). The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with long\u00a0pectoral fins\u00a0and a knobbly head. It is known for\u00a0breaching\u00a0and other distinctive\u00a0surface behaviors, making it popular with\u00a0whale watchers. Males produce a complex\u00a0song\u00a0lasting 10 to 20 minutes, which they repeat for hours at a time. All the males in a group will produce the same song, which is different each season. Its purpose is not clear, though it may help induce\u00a0estrus\u00a0in females.[4]\n\nHumpback whale[1]\n\nTemporal range:\u00a0Miocene\u2013Recent[2]\u00a0\n\nPre\u0404\n\n\u0404\n\nO\n\nS\n\nD\n\nC\n\nP\n\nT\n\nJ\n\nK\n\nPg\n\nN\n\nSize compared to an average human\n\nConservation status\n\n\nLeast Concern\u00a0(IUCN 3.1)[3]\n\nScientific classificationKingdom:AnimaliaPhylum:ChordataClass:MammaliaOrder:ArtiodactylaInfraorder:CetaceaFamily:BalaenopteridaeGenus:Megaptera\nGray, 1846Species:\n\nM.\u00a0novaeangliae\n\nBinomial nameMegaptera novaeangliae\n\nBorowski, 1781\n\nHumpback whale rangeSynonymsBalaena gibbosa\u00a0Erxleben, 1777B. boops\u00a0Fabricius, 1780B. nodosa\u00a0Bonnaterre, 1789B. longimana\u00a0Rudolphi, 1832Megaptera longimana\u00a0Gray, 1846Kyphobalaena longimana\u00a0Van Beneden, 1861Megaptera versabilis\u00a0Cope, 1869\n\nFound in\u00a0oceans\u00a0and\u00a0seas\u00a0around the world, humpback whales typically\u00a0migrate\u00a0up to 25,000\u00a0km (16,000\u00a0mi) each year.

That review provided its findings to the then Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt in December 2015. The findings were released to the public in September 2016. Whilst endorsing the process undertaken by previous governments to develop the 44 marine parks, the Review recommended changes to zoning in a number of the new parks.\n\nIn September 2016 the Turnbull Coalition Government commenced a further public consultation process to develop new management plans for the marine parks in order to change the zoning. In March 2018 the revised management plans were tabled in the Australian Parliament for consideration. Changes to the original 2012 zoning in the parks included removal of almost half the high level protective green \u2018sanctuary\u2019 zoning across the network - an area almost twice the size of the state of Victoria and equivalent in area to the loss of half of Australia's national parks on land - the biggest single windback of conservation area in Australia's history.\n\nThe alliance groups include:\n* [[Australian Conservation Foundation]]\n* [[Australian Marine Conservation Society]]\n* [[Conservation Council of Western Australia]]\n* [[Cairns and Far North Environment Centre]]\n* [[Conservation Council of WA]]\n* [[Conservation Council of South Australia]]\n* [[Environment Centre of the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Environment Tasmania]]\n* [[Environment Victoria]]\n* [[Environs Kimberley]]\n* [[Greenpeace Asia Pacific]]\n* [[Humane Society International]]\n* [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]]\n* [[National Parks Association of NSW]]\n* [[National Parks Association of Qld]]\n* [[Nature Conservation Council of NSW]]\n* [[North Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Project AWARE|Project AWARE Foundation]]\n* [[Sealife Trust]]\n* [[Sea Shepherd]]\n* [[Surfrider]]\n* [[The Nature Conservancy]]\n* [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]]\n* [[The Wilderness Society (Australia)|The Wilderness Society]]\n* [[Victorian National Parks Association]]\n* [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society]]\n* [[Wildlife Preservation Council of Qld]]\n* [[World Wildlife Fund|World Wildlife Fund \u2013 Australia]]\n\n'''What's at stake'''\n\nMarine sanctuaries (green zones) are proven to work alongside sensible fisheries management to provide safe havens for fish and marine life to recover and rebuild. Sanctuaries have been shown to prevent local extinctions and help make coral reefs more resilient to the impacts of climate change.\n \nIn 2012, Australia made history by creating the world's largest network of marine sanctuaries \u2013 protecting our incredible marine life, safeguarding our enviable coastal lifestyle, and giving fish populations across Australia the chance to rebuild and thrive.\n\nThe creation of the national network crossed political divides and received bi-partisan political support.

Video projectors use a very bright ultra high pressure mercury lamp, Xenon arc lamp, [[LED]] or solid state blue, RB, RGB or remote fiber optic RGB [[laser]]s to provide the illumination required to project the image, and most modern ones can correct any curves, blurriness, and other inconsistencies through manual settings. If a blue laser is used, a phosphor wheel is used to turn blue light into white light, which is also the case with white LEDs. (White LEDs do not use lasers.) A wheel is used in order to prolong the lifespan of the phosphor, as it is degraded by the heat generated by the laser diode. Remote fiber optic RGB laser racks can be placed far away from the projector, and several racks can be housed in a single, central room. Each projector can use up to 2 racks, and several monochrome lasers are mounted on each rack, the light of which is mixed and transmitted to the projector booth using optical fibers. Projectors using RB lasers use a blue laser with a phosphor wheel in conjuntion with a conventional solid state red laser. \n\nVideo projectors are used for many applications such as conference room presentations, classroom training, [[home cinema]] and [[concerts]]. In schools and other educational settings,<ref>{{cite web|title=Christmas is a time for taking -- from schools |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/18/local/me-theft18|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Charles Proctor|date=January 18, 2007|accessdate=2010-11-26}}</ref> they are sometimes connected to an [[interactive whiteboard]]. In the late 20th century they became commonplace in [[home cinema]]. Although large [[LCD television]] screens became quite popular, video projectors are still common among many home theater enthusiasts.\n\n==Overview==\nA video projector, also known as a digital projector, may project onto a traditional reflective projection screen, or it may be built into a cabinet with a translucent [[rear-projection television|rear-projection screen]] to form a single unified display device.\n\nCommon [[display resolution]]s  include [[SVGA]] (800\u00d7600 [[pixel]]s), [[XGA]] (1024\u00d7768 pixels), SXGA+ (1400x1050 pixels), [[720p]] (1280\u00d7720 pixels), and [[1080p]] (1920\u00d71080 pixels), 4K UHD (3840x2160), as well as 16:10 aspect ratio resolutions including WXGA+ (1280x800 pixels) and WUXGA (1920x1200 pixels)\n\nThe cost of a projector is typically driven by its base technology, features, resolution, and light output. A projector with a higher [[luminous flux|light output]] (measured in [[lumen (unit)|lumens]], \u201clm\u201d) is required for a larger screen or for a room with a larger amount of ambient light.<ref>{{cite book|title=Automated Lighting: The Art and Science of Moving Light in Theatre, Live Performance, Broadcast, and Entertainment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zfu9727rvjgC&pg=PA344&dq=other+important+factors+are+the+contrast+ratio,+the+ambient+light#v=onepage&q=other%20important%20factors%20are%20the%20contrast%20ratio%2C%20the%20ambient%20light&f=false|author=Richard Cadena|year=2006|isbn=978-0-240-80703-4|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|pages=344}}</ref> For example, a light output of approximately 1500 to 2500 [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] lumens is suitable for small screens viewed in rooms with low ambient light; approximately 2500 to 4000 lm is suitable for medium-sized screens with some ambient light; over 4000 lm is needed for very large screens or for use in rooms with no lighting control such as conference rooms. High brightness large-venue models are increasingly common in Boardrooms, Auditoriums and other high profile spaces, and models up to 30,000 lm are used in large staging applications such as concerts, keynote addresses and displays projected on buildings.\n\nA few [[camcorder]]s have a [[camcorder#Camcorder with built-in projector|built-in projector]] suitable to make a small projection; a few more powerful \"pico projectors\" are pocket-sized, and many projectors are portable.\n\n==Projection technologies==\n[[File:kalht 01.jpg|150px|thumb|right|A [[Zenith Electronics]] 1200 CRT Projector based [[home cinema|home theater]], ca. 2006.]]\n*[[LCD projector]] using [[LCD]] light gates. This is the simplest system, making it one of the most common and affordable for home theaters and business use. Common problems include a visible [[screen-door effect|\u201cscreen door\u201d or pixelation effect]], and the LCD panels deteriorating from heat & UV rays, leading to discolored spots or holes in the image, although recent advances have reduced the severity of these issues in some models.\n*[[Digital Light Processing|DLP projector]] using [[Texas Instruments]]\u2019 [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] technology. This uses one, two, or three [[microfabrication|microfabricated]] [[light valve]]s called [[digital micromirror device]]s (DMDs). The single- and double-DMD versions use rotating color wheels in time with the mirror refreshes to modulate color. The most common problem with the single- or two-DMD varieties is a visible \u201c[[Digital Light Processing#The color wheel \"rainbow effect\"|rainbow]]\u201d which some people perceive when moving their eyes. More recent projectors with higher speed (2x or 4x) and otherwise optimised color wheels have lessened this effect. 3-chip DLP projectors do not have this problem, as they display each [[primary color]] simultaneously, and offer higher light output and more accurate color reproduction, however the cost is significantly higher and thus 3-chip DLP technology is typically used in large venue, high brightness models, as well as Digital Cinema projectors.\n*LCoS projectors ([[liquid crystal on silicon]]).

Microvision projectors use Microvision's patented [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] laser beam-steering technology, whereas Aaxa Technologies uses laser diodes + LCoS.\n*Laser projectors are now available from most projector manufacturers, including Barco, Canon, Christie Digital, Dell, Epson, Hitachi, NEC, Optoma, Panasonic, Sony, Viewsonic and many others. These units use a laser light source (instead of conventional lamps), and are used with most common projection technologies, including Single & 3-Chip DLP, LCD and LCoS.  They offer numerous advantages, including eliminating the high cost and downtime of replacing lamps, variations in brightness and color that occur as lamps age and improved color fidelity.  Typical laser light sources used in projectors are rated for 20,000 hours before the light output is reduced to 50%, whereas lamps lose brightness quickly and need to be replaced after as little as 1000-2000 hours.   \n\n===Obsolete technologies===\n*[[CRT projector]] using [[cathode ray tube]]s.

Video projectors use a very bright ultra high pressure mercury lamp, Xenon arc lamp, [[LED]] or solid state blue, RB, RGB or remote fiber optic RGB [[laser]]s to provide the illumination required to project the image, and most modern ones can correct any curves, blurriness, and other inconsistencies through manual settings. If a blue laser is used, a phosphor wheel is used to turn blue light into white light, which is also the case with white LEDs. (White LEDs do not use lasers.) A wheel is used in order to prolong the lifespan of the phosphor, as it is degraded by the heat generated by the laser diode. Remote fiber optic RGB laser racks can be placed far away from the projector, and several racks can be housed in a single, central room. Each projector can use up to 2 racks, and several monochrome lasers are mounted on each rack, the light of which is mixed and transmitted to the projector booth using optical fibers. Projectors using RB lasers use a blue laser with a phosphor wheel in conjuntion with a conventional solid state red laser. \n\nVideo projectors are used for many applications such as conference room presentations, classroom training, [[home cinema]] and [[concerts]]. In schools and other educational settings,<ref>{{cite web|title=Christmas is a time for taking -- from schools |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/18/local/me-theft18|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Charles Proctor|date=January 18, 2007|accessdate=2010-11-26}}</ref> they are sometimes connected to an [[interactive whiteboard]]. In the late 20th century they became commonplace in [[home cinema]]. Although large [[LCD television]] screens became quite popular, video projectors are still common among many home theater enthusiasts.\n\n==Overview==\nA video projector, also known as a digital projector, may project onto a traditional reflective projection screen, or it may be built into a cabinet with a translucent [[rear-projection television|rear-projection screen]] to form a single unified display device.\n\nCommon [[display resolution]]s  include [[SVGA]] (800\u00d7600 [[pixel]]s), [[XGA]] (1024\u00d7768 pixels), SXGA+ (1400x1050 pixels), [[720p]] (1280\u00d7720 pixels), and [[1080p]] (1920\u00d71080 pixels), 4K UHD (3840x2160), as well as 16:10 aspect ratio resolutions including WXGA+ (1280x800 pixels) and WUXGA (1920x1200 pixels)\n\nThe cost of a projector is typically driven by its base technology, features, resolution, and light output. A projector with a higher [[luminous flux|light output]] (measured in [[lumen (unit)|lumens]], \u201clm\u201d) is required for a larger screen or for a room with a larger amount of ambient light.<ref>{{cite book|title=Automated Lighting: The Art and Science of Moving Light in Theatre, Live Performance, Broadcast, and Entertainment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zfu9727rvjgC&pg=PA344&dq=other+important+factors+are+the+contrast+ratio,+the+ambient+light#v=onepage&q=other%20important%20factors%20are%20the%20contrast%20ratio%2C%20the%20ambient%20light&f=false|author=Richard Cadena|year=2006|isbn=978-0-240-80703-4|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|pages=344}}</ref> For example, a light output of approximately 1500 to 2500 [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] lumens is suitable for small screens viewed in rooms with low ambient light; approximately 2500 to 4000 lm is suitable for medium-sized screens with some ambient light; over 4000 lm is needed for very large screens or for use in rooms with no lighting control such as conference rooms. High brightness large-venue models are increasingly common in Boardrooms, Auditoriums and other high profile spaces, and models up to 30,000 lm are used in large staging applications such as concerts, keynote addresses and displays projected on buildings.\n\nA few [[camcorder]]s have a [[camcorder#Camcorder with built-in projector|built-in projector]] suitable to make a small projection; a few more powerful \"pico projectors\" are pocket-sized, and many projectors are portable.\n\n==Projection technologies==\n[[File:kalht 01.jpg|150px|thumb|right|A [[Zenith Electronics]] 1200 CRT Projector based [[home cinema|home theater]], ca. 2006.]]\n*[[LCD projector]] using [[LCD]] light gates. This is the simplest system, making it one of the most common and affordable for home theaters and business use. Common problems include a visible [[screen-door effect|\u201cscreen door\u201d or pixelation effect]], and the LCD panels deteriorating from heat & UV rays, leading to discolored spots or holes in the image, although recent advances have reduced the severity of these issues in some models.\n*[[Digital Light Processing|DLP projector]] using [[Texas Instruments]]\u2019 [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] technology. This uses one, two, or three [[microfabrication|microfabricated]] [[light valve]]s called [[digital micromirror device]]s (DMDs). The single- and double-DMD versions use rotating color wheels in time with the mirror refreshes to modulate color. The most common problem with the single- or two-DMD varieties is a visible \u201c[[Digital Light Processing#The color wheel \"rainbow effect\"|rainbow]]\u201d which some people perceive when moving their eyes. More recent projectors with higher speed (2x or 4x) and otherwise optimised color wheels have lessened this effect. 3-chip DLP projectors do not have this problem, as they display each [[primary color]] simultaneously, and offer higher light output and more accurate color reproduction, however the cost is significantly higher and thus 3-chip DLP technology is typically used in large venue, high brightness models, as well as Digital Cinema projectors.\n*LCoS projectors ([[liquid crystal on silicon]]). Such projectors often process light in the [[Fourier optics|Fourier domain]], which enables correction of optical aberrations using [[Zernike polynomials]].<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1109/JDT.2015.2418436|title = Optimization-Based Adaptive Optical Correction for Holographic Projectors|journal = Journal of Display Technology|volume = 11|issue = 7|pages = 596\u2013603|year = 2015|last1 = Kaczorowski|first1 = Andrzej|last2 = Gordon|first2 = George S.|last3 = Palani|first3 = Ananta|last4 = Czerniawski|first4 = Stanislaw|last5 = Wilkinson|first5 = Timothy D.}}</ref>  Some commercially available technologies include:\n**[[D-ILA]] JVC\u2019s Direct-drive Image Light Amplifier based on LCoS technology.\n**[[SXRD]] Sony\u2019s proprietary variant of LCoS technology.\n*[[LED]] projectors use one of the above-mentioned technologies for image creation, with a difference that they use an array of Light Emitting Diodes as the light source, negating the need for lamp replacement.\n*Hybrid [[LED]] and [[laser diode]] system developed by [[Casio]]. Uses a combination of Light Emitting Diodes and 445&nbsp;nm [[laser diode]]s as the light source, while image is processed with DLP (DMD) chip.\n*[[Laser diode]] projectors have been developed by [[MicroVision, Inc.|Microvision]] and Aaxa Technologies. Microvision projectors use Microvision's patented [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] laser beam-steering technology, whereas Aaxa Technologies uses laser diodes + LCoS.\n*Laser projectors are now available from most projector manufacturers, including Barco, Canon, Christie Digital, Dell, Epson, Hitachi, NEC, Optoma, Panasonic, Sony, Viewsonic and many others. These units use a laser light source (instead of conventional lamps), and are used with most common projection technologies, including Single & 3-Chip DLP, LCD and LCoS.  They offer numerous advantages, including eliminating the high cost and downtime of replacing lamps, variations in brightness and color that occur as lamps age and improved color fidelity.  Typical laser light sources used in projectors are rated for 20,000 hours before the light output is reduced to 50%, whereas lamps lose brightness quickly and need to be replaced after as little as 1000-2000 hours.   \n\n===Obsolete technologies===\n*[[CRT projector]] using [[cathode ray tube]]s.

A number of [[contestant]]s (known as \"housemates\") live in a [[bespoke|purpose-built]] house and are isolated from the rest of the world. Each week, housemates nominate two of their peers for eviction, and the housemates who receives the most nominations would face a public [[vote]]. Of these, one would eventually leave, having been \"evicted\" from the House. However, there were exceptions to this process as dictated by Bigg Boss Bangla. In the final week, there were three housemates remaining, and the public voted for who they wanted to win. The housemates in the Bengali version are primarily celebrities.<ref name=\"bb\">{{cite web |title=Bigg Boss Bangla |url=http://endemol.co.in/what-we-do/non-fiction/big-boss/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728225652/http://endemol.co.in/what-we-do/non-fiction/big-boss/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 July 2010 |publisher=Endemol |accessdate=2010-12-20 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== The House ===\n\nThe Bigg Boss House is located in the tourist center of Lonavala, Pune district of Maharashtra.

It follows the ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' format, which was first developed by [[Endemol]] in the [[Netherlands]].The Show had completed two seasons in four years.The First season Launched in 17 June 2013 and Second season was launched in 04 April 2016.\n\n''Bigg Boss'' Season 1 was telecast by [[ETV Bangla]], a Bengali general entertainment channel, hosted by [[Mithun Chakraborty]] and the second season was telecast by [[Colors Bangla]] which was rebranded channel of [[ETV Bangla]] and show was hosted by [[Jeet (actor)|Jeet]].\n\n== Overview ==\n===Concept===\n''Bigg Boss Bangla'' is a [[reality television|reality show]] based on the [[Hindi]] show ''[[Bigg Boss]]'' which too was based on the original [[Big Brother (Netherlands)|Dutch ''Big Brother'']] format developed by [[John de Mol]]. A number of [[contestant]]s (known as \"housemates\") live in a [[bespoke|purpose-built]] house and are isolated from the rest of the world. Each week, housemates nominate two of their peers for eviction, and the housemates who receives the most nominations would face a public [[vote]]. Of these, one would eventually leave, having been \"evicted\" from the House. However, there were exceptions to this process as dictated by Bigg Boss Bangla. In the final week, there were three housemates remaining, and the public voted for who they wanted to win. The housemates in the Bengali version are primarily celebrities.<ref name=\"bb\">{{cite web |title=Bigg Boss Bangla |url=http://endemol.co.in/what-we-do/non-fiction/big-boss/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728225652/http://endemol.co.in/what-we-do/non-fiction/big-boss/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 July 2010 |publisher=Endemol |accessdate=2010-12-20 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== The House ===\n\nThe Bigg Boss House is located in the tourist center of Lonavala, Pune district of Maharashtra.

Scientific research on hadrosaurs began in the [[:Category:1850s in paleontology|1850s]],<ref name=\"horner-weishampel-forster-table-443\" /> when [[Joseph Leidy]] described the genera ''[[Thespesius]]'' and ''[[Trachodon]]'' based on scrappy fossils [[History of paleontology in the United States|discovered]] [[Paleontology in the United States|in]] the western [[United States]]. Just two years later he published a description of the much better-preserved remains of an animal [[Paleontology in New Jersey|from]] [[New Jersey]] that he named ''[[Hadrosaurus]]''.<ref name=\"horner-weishampel-forster-intro-438\" />\n\nThe early [[:Category:20th century in paleontology|20th century]] saw such a boom in hadrosaur discoveries and research that paleontologists' knowledge of these dinosaurs \"increased by virtually an order of magnitude\" according to a [[2004 in paleontology|2004]] review by [[John R. Horner|Horner]], [[David B. Weishampel|Weishampel]], and Forster. This period is known as the great North American Dinosaur rush because of the research and excavation efforts of paleontologists like [[Barnum Brown|Brown]], [[Charles W. Gilmore|Gilmore]], [[Lawrence Lambe|Lambe]], [[William Parks (paleontologist)|Parks]], and the [[Charles Hazelius Sternberg|Sternbergs]]. Major discoveries included the variety of cranial ornamentation among hadrosaurs as scientist came to characterize uncrested, solid crested, and hollow crested species.<ref name=\"horner-weishampel-forster-intro-438\" /> Notable new taxa included  ''[[Saurolophus]]'', ''[[Corythosaurus]]'', ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', and ''[[Lambeosaurus]]''.<ref name=\"horner-weishampel-forster-table439-442\" /> In [[1942 in paleontology|1942]] [[Richard Swann Lull]] and Wright published what Horner, Weishampel, and Forster characterized as the \"first important synthesis of hadrosaurid anatomy and phylogeny\".<ref name=\"horner-weishampel-forster-intro-438\" />\n\nMore recent discoveries include gigantic hadrosaurs like ''[[Shantungosaurus giganteus]]'' from [[China]].<ref name=\"horner-weishampel-forster-table-441\" /> At 15 meters in length and nearly 16 metric tons in weight it is the largest known hadrosaur and is known from a nearly complete skeleton.<ref name=\"lucas-nemegtian-181\" />\n\nHadrosaur research has continued to remain active even into the new millennium. In [[2000 in paleontology|2000]], Horner and others found that hatchling ''Maiasaura'' grew to adult body sizes at a rate more like a [[mammal]]'s than a [[reptile]]. That same year, Case and others reported the discovery of hadrosaur bones in [[Vega Island]], [[Antarctica]]. After decades of such dedicated research, hadrosaurs have become one of the best understood group of dinosaurs.<ref name=\"horner-weishampel-forster-intro-438\" />\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== 19th century ==\n\n=== 1850s ===\n[[File:Thespesius occidentalis.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of the ''[[Thespesius]]'' [[syntype]]]]\n[[File:Trachodon mirabilis.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of ''[[Trachodon]]'' teeth]]\n[[File:Hadrosaurus mount.jpg|thumb|upright|The first mounted dinosaur skeleton, that of ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'']]\n'''[[1856 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C;\">1856</span>]]'''{{anchor|1856}}\n* [[Joseph Leidy]] described the new genus and species ''[[Thespesius occidentalis]]''.

Scientific research on hadrosaurs began in the [[:Category:1850s in paleontology|1850s]],<ref name=\"horner-weishampel-forster-table-443\" /> when [[Joseph Leidy]] described the genera ''[[Thespesius]]'' and ''[[Trachodon]]'' based on scrappy fossils [[History of paleontology in the United States|discovered]] [[Paleontology in the United States|in]] the western [[United States]]. Just two years later he published a description of the much better-preserved remains of an animal [[Paleontology in New Jersey|from]] [[New Jersey]] that he named ''[[Hadrosaurus]]''.<ref name=\"horner-weishampel-forster-intro-438\" />\n\nThe early [[:Category:20th century in paleontology|20th century]] saw such a boom in hadrosaur discoveries and research that paleontologists' knowledge of these dinosaurs \"increased by virtually an order of magnitude\" according to a [[2004 in paleontology|2004]] review by [[John R. Horner|Horner]], [[David B. Weishampel|Weishampel]], and Forster. This period is known as the great North American Dinosaur rush because of the research and excavation efforts of paleontologists like [[Barnum Brown|Brown]], [[Charles W. Gilmore|Gilmore]], [[Lawrence Lambe|Lambe]], [[William Parks (paleontologist)|Parks]], and the [[Charles Hazelius Sternberg|Sternbergs]]. Major discoveries included the variety of cranial ornamentation among hadrosaurs as scientist came to characterize uncrested, solid crested, and hollow crested species.<ref name=\"horner-weishampel-forster-intro-438\" /> Notable new taxa included  ''[[Saurolophus]]'', ''[[Corythosaurus]]'', ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', and ''[[Lambeosaurus]]''.<ref name=\"horner-weishampel-forster-table439-442\" /> In [[1942 in paleontology|1942]] [[Richard Swann Lull]] and Wright published what Horner, Weishampel, and Forster characterized as the \"first important synthesis of hadrosaurid anatomy and phylogeny\".<ref name=\"horner-weishampel-forster-intro-438\" />\n\nMore recent discoveries include gigantic hadrosaurs like ''[[Shantungosaurus giganteus]]'' from [[China]].<ref name=\"horner-weishampel-forster-table-441\" /> At 15 meters in length and nearly 16 metric tons in weight it is the largest known hadrosaur and is known from a nearly complete skeleton.<ref name=\"lucas-nemegtian-181\" />\n\nHadrosaur research has continued to remain active even into the new millennium. In [[2000 in paleontology|2000]], Horner and others found that hatchling ''Maiasaura'' grew to adult body sizes at a rate more like a [[mammal]]'s than a [[reptile]]. That same year, Case and others reported the discovery of hadrosaur bones in [[Vega Island]], [[Antarctica]]. After decades of such dedicated research, hadrosaurs have become one of the best understood group of dinosaurs.<ref name=\"horner-weishampel-forster-intro-438\" />\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== 19th century ==\n\n=== 1850s ===\n[[File:Thespesius occidentalis.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of the ''[[Thespesius]]'' [[syntype]]]]\n[[File:Trachodon mirabilis.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of ''[[Trachodon]]'' teeth]]\n[[File:Hadrosaurus mount.jpg|thumb|upright|The first mounted dinosaur skeleton, that of ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'']]\n'''[[1856 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C;\">1856</span>]]'''{{anchor|1856}}\n* [[Joseph Leidy]] described the new genus and species ''[[Thespesius occidentalis]]''.

It is situated {{convert|38|mi|km|abbr=off}} north of [[Dundee]] between the mouths of the North and South Esk rivers. It is the northernmost coastal town in Angus and developed as a natural harbour that traded in skins, hides and cured salmon in medieval times.\n\nWith a population of approximately 12,000, the town functions as a port, but the major employer is [[GlaxoSmithKline]], which was saved from closure in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contractorsunlimited.co.uk/news/060406-glaxosmithkline.shtml|title=GlaxoSmithKline - Montrose Plant|author=|date=|website=www.contractorsunlimited.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> The skyline of Montrose is dominated by the {{convert|220|ft|m|adj=on}} [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]] of [[Montrose Old and St Andrew's Church|Old and St Andrew's Church]], designed by [[James Gillespie Graham]] and built between 1832 and 1834.\n\nMontrose is a town with a wealth of architecture, and is a centre for international trade.

Just outside Montrose is the 18th-century [[House of Dun]], designed by the Scottish architect [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]] and built in 1730 for David Erskine, 13th Laird of Dun.\n\n==History==\n\n===Toponymy and early history===\n\nPrehistoric elements are found in the vicinity of Montrose, including the [[Stone of Morphie]] located to the north.<ref>[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=8404 C. Michael Hogan, ''Stone of Morphie'', 2007, Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham]</ref> One ancient name for Montrose was Celurca.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p1</ref> Early place names appear to show the presence of a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in the area of the present harbour. The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

This is reflected by the motto on the town's seal: ''Mare ditat, rosa decorat''.<ref>[http://stat-acc-scot.edina.ac.uk/link/1791-99/Forfar/Montrose/] Rev.

In the year 980 it was sacked and razed to the ground.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p6</ref> It was once believed that a castle existed in Montrose in the 10th century and was destroyed by [[Kenneth III]]. However the historicity of this account has been disputed.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Andrew Jervise, \"Memorials of Angus and the Mearns\"</ref>\n\nIn the two proceeding centuries there are no precise dates in its history. During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside. The ruins have acquired the name [[Red Castle, Angus|Red Castle]]. The last record of a charter there was in 1198.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\">Mitchell (1866), p8</ref> A [[convent]] dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]] is said to have been founded in 1230 by [[Alan Durward]] but the precise location is unknown.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1244 the town succumbed to fire.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\nIn July 1296<ref>[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm Angus Council, \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> during the Wars of Independence, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] visited the town with 30,000 of his men and stayed at Munros castle for three nights. Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

The Asylum, initially called Montrose Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary  was founded by Susan Carnegie of Charleton to treat both paupers and private patients and was originally situated on Montrose Links. It was granted a Royal Charter in 1810. In 1858 it moved to Sunnyside farm at the nearby village of Hillside. Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962. Sunnyside remained in use for the treatment of people with mental illnesses until its final closure in 2011 when many of its patients and functions moved to the Susan Carnegie Centre at [[Stracathro Hospital]].<ref name=\"Sunnyside\">{{cite web|title=THB 23 Sunnyside Royal Hospital|url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27THB%2023%27%29|website=Archive Services Online Catalogue|publisher=University of Dundee|accessdate=9 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1785 a [[subscription library]] for learned men was formed.<ref>[http://stat-acc-scot.edina.ac.uk/link/1791-99/Forfar/Montrose/] Rev.

As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons, which flew sorties over [[Norway]] and were a part of the air defences for [[Edinburgh]]. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion. Despite its coastal location presenting a danger however, large numbers of children and young mothers from [[Dundee]] were evacuated there during the period of the [[Phoney War]]. Initially numbers totalled around 2,000 but in a second wave around 1,200 more were sent.<ref name=\"Forbes Inglis 2009\">Forbes Inglis, \"An Invasion of Montrose\", ''Montrose Review'', 20 August 2009.</ref> As was the case in many other receiving areas, the local population was concerned by the condition of the urban poor and [[impetigo]] and [[vermin]] were found on some of those evacuated.

He saved the life of Lieutenant Commander Olav Nilsen at Dundee Docks and generally protected his fellow sailors. In stories Bamse is said to have got up on his hind legs and, at over {{convert|6|ft}} tall, clamped his great paws on assailants to end any fight. On his death in July 1944 Montrose schools were closed and 800 children lined the route to his graveside funeral.\n\nThe Bamse Project raised \u00a350,000 to erect a larger than life-size bronze statue of Bamse at Montrose Harbour.  Half the donations came from Norway. The statue was created by internationally known sculptor [[Alan Herriot]], and was unveiled by [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|The Duke of York]] in October 2007.\n\n==Governance==\n\nMontrose is represented within [[Angus Council]] by the Montrose & District Ward, from which four councillors are elected.

The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street.

The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived.

The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962.

As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons, which flew sorties over [[Norway]] and were a part of the air defences for [[Edinburgh]]. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion.

The term ''a cappella'' was originally intended to differentiate between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] [[polyphony]] and [[Baroque (music)|Baroque]] [[concertato]] style. In the 19th century, a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music.<ref name=Holmes/> The term is also used, albeit rarely, as a synonym for ''[[alla breve]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Arnold|1998|p=314}}</ref>\n\n==Religious origins==\nA cappella music was originally used in religious music, especially [[church music]] as well as [[anasheed]] and [[zemirot]]. [[Gregorian chant]] is an example of a cappella singing, as is the majority of secular vocal music from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]]. The [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]], up until its development in the early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] into an instrumentally-accompanied form, is also usually in a cappella form. Jewish and Early Christian music was largely a cappella, although as noted by the Psalms some songs were accompanied by string instruments<ref>{{Cite book|title=Music in ancient Judaism and early Christianity|last=Smith|first= John Arthur|isbn=978-1409421610|location=Farnham, Surrey|oclc=715159344}}</ref>{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; many Old Testament passages make reference to multiple instruments being used. [By definition, Christianity began with the New Testament.]|date=November 2013}} and this practice has continued in both of these religions as well as in Islam.\n\n===Christian===\nThe [[polyphony]] of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century AD, with compositions by [[Josquin des Prez]].<ref name=EB>{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}</ref> The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument, although this instrument<!--Which instrument? A single melody instrument or a polyphonic instrument like a pipe organ?--> would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella [[polyphony]] had further developed, but gradually, the [[cantata]] began to take the place of a cappella forms.<ref name=EB/> 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ \"doubling\" some or all of the voices.<ref name=EB/> Such is seen in the life of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] becoming a major influence on [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], most notably in the ''[[Mass in B Minor]]''.\n\nOther composers that utilized the a cappella style, if only for the occasional piece, were [[Claudio Monteverdi]] and his masterpiece, ''Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata'' (A lover's tears at his beloved's grave), which was composed in 1610,<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005a|p=6}}</ref> and [[Andrea Gabrieli]] when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces, one of which was in the unaccompanied style.<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005|p=780}}</ref> Learning from the preceding two composeres, [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces, chief among these were the pieces in the [[oratorio]] style, which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week, such as Christ's suffering and [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]]. Five of Schutz's ''Historien'' were Easter pieces, and of these the latter three, which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints, those of [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] and [[John the Evangelist|John]], were all done a cappella style. This was a near requirement for this type of piece, and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted parts from either Christ or the authors were performed in a [[plainchant]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005a|p=73}}</ref>\n\n====Byzantine Rite====\nIn the Byzantine Rite of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the music performed in the liturgies is exclusively sung without instrumental accompaniment. Bishop Kallistos Ware says, \"The service is sung, even though there may be no choir... In the Orthodox Church today, as in the early Church, singing is unaccompanied and instrumental music is not found.\"<ref name=Ware>{{harvnb|Ware|1997|p=268}}</ref> This a cappella behavior arises from strict interpretation of Psalms 150, which states, ''Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.''<ref>{{bibleverse||Psalms|150:6}}</ref> In keeping with this philosophy, early Russian ''musika'' which started appearing in the late 17th century, in what was known as ''khorov\u00efye kontsert\u00ef'' (choral concertos) made a cappella adaptations of Venetian-styled pieces, such as the treatise, ''Grammatika musikiyskaya'' (1675), by [[Nikolai Diletsky]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005b|p=234}}</ref> Divine Liturgies and Western Rite masses composed by famous composers such as [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Tchaikovsky)|Peter Tchaikovsky]], [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Rachmaninoff)|Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Alexander Arkhangelsky (composer)|Alexander Arkhangelsky]], and [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Leontovych)|Mykola Leontovych]] are fine examples of this.\n\n====Opposition to instruments in worship====\nPresent-day Christian religious bodies known for conducting their worship services without musical accompaniment include many [[Anabaptist]] communities (such as the [[Amish]], [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], [[Old Order Mennonites]] and [[Conservative Mennonites]]), some [[Presbyterian]] churches devoted to the [[regulative principle of worship]], [[Old Regular Baptist]]s, [[Primitive Baptist]]s, [[Plymouth Brethren]], [[Churches of Christ]], Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma), the [[Reformed Free Methodist Church|Reformed Free Methodists]],<ref name=\"Jones1974\">{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Charles Edwin |title=A guide to the study of the holiness movement |date=1974 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0810807037 |page=[https://archive.org/details/guidetostudyoft00char/page/685 685] |language=English |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetostudyoft00char/page/685 }}</ref> [[Doukhobor]]s, and the [[Byzantine Rite]] of Eastern Christianity. Certain [[high church]] services and other musical events in liturgical churches (such as the Roman Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]]) may be a cappella, a practice remaining from apostolic times. Many [[Mennonite]]s also conduct some or all of their services without instruments. [[Sacred Harp]], a type of [[folk music]], is an a cappella style of religious singing with [[shape notes]], usually sung at singing conventions.\n\nOpponents of [[musical instruments in the Christian worship]] believe that such opposition is supported by the Christian scriptures and Church history. The scriptures typically referenced are [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026:30;%20Acts%2016:25;%20Romans%2015:9;%201%20Corinthians%2014:15;%20Ephesians%205:19;%20Colossians%203:16;%20Hebrews%202:12,%13:15;%20James%205:13;&version=49; Matthew 26:30; Acts 16:25; Romans 15:9; 1 Corinthians 14:15; Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16; Hebrews 2:12, 13:15; James 5:13], which show examples and exhortations for Christians to sing.<ref name=kurfees>{{harvnb|Kurfees|1911}}</ref>\n\nThere is no reference to instrumental music in early church worship in the New Testament, or in the worship of churches for the first six centuries.<ref name=McKinnon>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1965|pp=263, 265}}</ref><ref name=Bales>{{harvnb|Bales|1973|p=351}}</ref> Several reasons have been posited throughout church history for the absence of instrumental music in church worship.{{refn|group=\"nb\"|The absence of instrumental music is rooted in various hermeneutic principles (ways of interpreting the Bible) which determine what is appropriate for worship. Among such principles are the [[regulative principle of worship]] (Ulrich Zwingli), [[Sola scriptura]] (Martin Luther and Ulrich Zwingli), and the history of [[hymn]] in \"Christianity\". Dispensationalism emphasizes the differences between the old (Law of Moses) and the new (Jesus and the Apostles) covenants, emphasizing that the majority of the practices from the Law of Moses were replaced by the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles. The absence of instrumental music in early church worship is significant given the abundance of Hebrew Bible references and commands to worship God with harp, lyre and cymbal. After several hundred years of Tabernacle worship without references to instrumental music, King David (c. 1500 BC) introduced musical instruments into Temple worship reportedly because of a commandment from God, complete with who was to sing, who was to play, and what instruments were to be used.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25-29}}</ref>}}\n\nChristians who believe in a cappella music today believe that in the Israelite worship assembly during Temple worship only the Priests of Levi sang, played, and offered animal sacrifices, whereas in the church era, all Christians are commanded to sing praises to God. They believe that if God wanted instrumental music in New Testament worship, He would have commanded not just singing, but singing and playing like he did in the Hebrew scriptures.\n\nThe first recorded example of a musical instrument in Roman Catholic worship was a [[pipe organ]] introduced by [[Pope Vitalian]] into a cathedral in Rome around 670.<ref>American Encyclopedia, Volume 12, p. 688{{title missing}}</ref>{{refn|group=\"nb\"|McKinnon maintained that the organ was the first instrument to be introduced into worship and the next was the trumpet.

There is no written opposition to musical instruments in any setting in the first century and a half of Christian churches (33\u2013180 AD).<ref name=McKinnon2>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1989|p=2}}</ref> The use of instruments for Christian worship during this period is also undocumented.

The Free Methodist Church allowed for local church decision on the use of either an organ or piano in the 1943 Conference before lifting the ban entirely in 1955. The [[Reformed Free Methodist Church]] and [[Evangelical Wesleyan Church]] were formed as a result of a schism with the Free Methodist Church, with the former retaining a cappella worship and the latter retaining the rule limiting the number of instruments in the church to the piano and organ.<ref name=\"Jones1974\"/>\npornhub\n===Jewish===\nWhile worship in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] included musical instruments ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25\u201329:27}}), traditional Jewish religious services in the Synagogue, both before and after the last destruction of the Temple, did not include musical instruments<ref>{{harvnb|Price|2005|p=68}}</ref> given the practice of scriptural [[cantillation]].<ref>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1998|p=85}}</ref> The use of musical instruments is traditionally forbidden on the Sabbath out of concern that players would be tempted to repair (or tune) their instruments, which is forbidden on those days. (This prohibition has been relaxed in many Reform and some Conservative congregations.) Similarly, when Jewish families and larger groups sing traditional Sabbath songs known as [[zemirot]] outside the context of formal religious services, they usually do so a cappella, and Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations on the Sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles. During [[the Three Weeks]] musical instruments are prohibited. Many Jews consider a portion of the 49-day period of the [[Counting of the Omer|counting of the omer]] between Passover and Shavuot to be a time of semi-mourning and instrumental music is not allowed during that time.<ref>{{harvnb|Melamed|2013}}</ref> This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as ''sefirah'' music.<ref name=\"Shircago\">{{harvnb|Shircago|2013}}</ref>\n\nThe popularization of the Jewish chant may be found in the writings of the Jewish philosopher [[Philo]], born 20 BC.

The new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments, including [[vocal percussion]]/\"[[beatboxing]]\". Some larger universities now have multiple groups. Groups often join one another in on-campus concerts, such as [[the Georgetown Chimes]]' Cherry Tree Massacre, a 3-weekend a cappella festival held each February since 1975, where over a hundred collegiate groups have appeared, as well as [[List of quartet champions by year|International Quartet Champions]] [[Boston Common (quartet)|The Boston Common]] and the contemporary commercial a cappella group [[Rockapella]].

Also, Dil se, another co-ed a cappella from UC Berkeley, hosts the \"Anahat\" competition at the University of California, Berkeley annually. Maize Mirchi, the co-ed a cappella group from the [[University of Michigan]] hosts \"Sa Re Ga Ma Pella\", an annual South Asian a cappella invitational with various groups from the Midwest. Another South Asian group from the Midwest is Chai Town who is based in the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign.\n\nJewish-interest groups such as [[Queens College]]'s Tizmoret, [[Tufts University]]'s [[Shir Appeal]], [[University of Chicago]]'s Rhythm and Jews, [[Binghamton University]]'s Kaskeset, [[Ohio State University]]'s Meshuganotes, [[Rutgers University]]'s Kol Halayla, [[New York University]]'s Ani V'Ata and [[Yale University]]'s Magevet are also gaining popularity across the U.S.<ref>{{harvnb|Ginsberg|2015}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Altshuler|2013}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Shapiro|2011}}</ref>\n\nIncreased interest in modern a cappella (particularly collegiate a cappella) can be seen in the growth of awards such as the Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards (overseen by the [[Contemporary A Cappella Society]]) and competitions such as the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella]] for college groups and the [[Harmony Sweepstakes]] for all groups. In December 2009, a new television competition series called ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' aired on [[NBC]]. The show featured eight a cappella groups from the United States and Puerto Rico vying for the prize of $100,000 and a recording contract with [[Epic Records]]/[[Sony Music]]. The show was judged by [[Ben Folds]], [[Shawn Stockman]], and [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and was won by an all-male group from Puerto Rico called [[Nota (group)|Nota]]. The show returned for a second, third and fourth season, won by [[Committed (group)|Committed]], [[Pentatonix]] and [[Home Free (group)|Home Free]] respectively.\n\nEach year, hundreds of Collegiate a cappella groups submit their strongest songs in a competition to be on The Best of College A Cappella (BOCA), an album compilation of tracks from the best college a cappella groups around the world. The album is produced by Varsity Vocals&nbsp;\u2013 which also produces the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella&nbsp;\u2013 and [[Deke Sharon]]. ). According to ethnomusicologist Joshua S. Dunchan, \"BOCA carries considerable cache and respect within the field despite the appearance of other compilations in part, perhaps, because of its longevity and the prestige of the individuals behind it.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dunchan|first=Joshua|date=2012|title=Recordings, Technology, and Discourse in Collegiate A Cappella|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/490098|journal=Journal of American Folklore|volume=125|issue=498|pages=488\u2013502|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.5406/jamerfolk.125.498.0488}}</ref>\n\nCollegiate a cappella groups may also submit their tracks to Voices Only, a two-disc series released at the beginning of each school year. A Voices Only album has been released every year since 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, all women's a cappella groups can send their strongest song tracks to the Women's A Cappella Association (WACA) for its annual best of women's a cappella album. WACA offers another medium for women's voices to receive recognition and has released an album every year since 2014, featuring women's groups from across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Women's A Cappella Association |url=http://www.womensacappella.org/#!recordings/cfpt |website=Women's A Cappella Association |access-date=4 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Emulating instruments==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nIn addition to singing words, some a cappella singers also emulate instrumentation by reproducing instrumental sounds with their [[vocal cords]] and mouth, often pitched using specialised pitch pipes. One of the earliest 20th century practitioners of this method were [[The Mills Brothers]] whose early recordings of the 1930s clearly stated on the label that all instrumentation was done vocally. More recently, \"[[Twilight Zone (dance song)|Twilight Zone]]\" by [[2 Unlimited]] was sung a cappella to the instrumentation on the comedy television series ''Tompkins Square''. Another famous example of emulating instrumentation instead of singing the words is the theme song for ''[[The New Addams Family]]'' series on [[Fox Family Channel]] (now [[ABC Family]]). Groups such as [[Vocal Sampling]] and Undivided emulate Latin rhythms a cappella. In the 1960s, the Swingle Singers used their voices to emulate musical instruments to Baroque and Classical music. Vocal artist [[Bobby McFerrin]] is famous for his instrumental emulation. A cappella group [[Naturally Seven]] recreates entire songs using vocal tones for every instrument.\n\nThe [[Swingle Singers]] used nonsense words to sound like instruments, but have been known to produce non-verbal versions of musical instruments. [[Beatboxing]], more accurately known as vocal percussion, is a technique used in a cappella music popularized by the [[hip-hop]] community, where [[Rapping|rap]] is often performed a cappella also. The advent of vocal percussion added new dimensions to the a cappella genre and has become very prevalent in modern arrangements.<ref>{{harvnb|Pauley|2012}}</ref> Jazz vocalist [[Petra Haden]] used a four-track recorder to produce an a cappella version of ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' including the instruments and fake advertisements on her album ''[[Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out]]'' in 2005. Haden has also released a cappella versions of [[Journey (band)|Journey]]'s \"[[Don't Stop Believin']]\", [[The Beach Boys]]' \"[[God Only Knows]]\" and [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]\".\n\nChristian rock group [[Relient K]] recorded the song \"Plead the Fifth\" a cappella on its album ''[[Five Score and Seven Years Ago]]''. The group recorded lead singer [[Matt Thiessen]] making drum noises and played them with an electronic drum machine to record the song.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lists of a cappella groups]]\n** [[List of professional a cappella groups]]\n** [[List of collegiate a cappella groups|List of collegiate a cappella groups in the United States]]\n** [[List of university a cappella groups in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite web|last=Alleman|first=Annie|url=http://heraldnews.suntimes.com/entertainment/8071132-421/chicago-a-cappella-sings-music-of-high-holidays.html|title=Chicago a cappella sings music of high holidays|year=2011|work=Chicago Sun times|location=Chicago, Illinois|ref=harv|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124121724/http://heraldnews.suntimes.com/entertainment/8071132-421/chicago-a-cappella-sings-music-of-high-holidays.html|archivedate=24 January 2012}}\n* {{cite news |last=Altshuler |first=George |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/67365/singers-find-sure-appeal-of-jewish-a-cappella-groups/ |title=Singers find sure appeal of Jewish a cappella groups |newspaper=[[j.

capella\" from Latin) music is group or solo singing without [[Musical instrument|instrumental]] [[accompaniment]], or a piece intended to be performed in this way. The term ''a cappella'' was originally intended to differentiate between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] [[polyphony]] and [[Baroque (music)|Baroque]] [[concertato]] style. In the 19th century, a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music.<ref name=Holmes/> The term is also used, albeit rarely, as a synonym for ''[[alla breve]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Arnold|1998|p=314}}</ref>\n\n==Religious origins==\nA cappella music was originally used in religious music, especially [[church music]] as well as [[anasheed]] and [[zemirot]]. [[Gregorian chant]] is an example of a cappella singing, as is the majority of secular vocal music from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]]. The [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]], up until its development in the early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] into an instrumentally-accompanied form, is also usually in a cappella form. Jewish and Early Christian music was largely a cappella, although as noted by the Psalms some songs were accompanied by string instruments<ref>{{Cite book|title=Music in ancient Judaism and early Christianity|last=Smith|first= John Arthur|isbn=978-1409421610|location=Farnham, Surrey|oclc=715159344}}</ref>{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; many Old Testament passages make reference to multiple instruments being used.

A single melody instrument or a polyphonic instrument like a pipe organ?--> would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella [[polyphony]] had further developed, but gradually, the [[cantata]] began to take the place of a cappella forms.<ref name=EB/> 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ \"doubling\" some or all of the voices.<ref name=EB/> Such is seen in the life of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] becoming a major influence on [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], most notably in the ''[[Mass in B Minor]]''.\n\nOther composers that utilized the a cappella style, if only for the occasional piece, were [[Claudio Monteverdi]] and his masterpiece, ''Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata'' (A lover's tears at his beloved's grave), which was composed in 1610,<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005a|p=6}}</ref> and [[Andrea Gabrieli]] when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces, one of which was in the unaccompanied style.<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005|p=780}}</ref> Learning from the preceding two composeres, [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces, chief among these were the pieces in the [[oratorio]] style, which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week, such as Christ's suffering and [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]]. Five of Schutz's ''Historien'' were Easter pieces, and of these the latter three, which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints, those of [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] and [[John the Evangelist|John]], were all done a cappella style. This was a near requirement for this type of piece, and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted parts from either Christ or the authors were performed in a [[plainchant]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005a|p=73}}</ref>\n\n====Byzantine Rite====\nIn the Byzantine Rite of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the music performed in the liturgies is exclusively sung without instrumental accompaniment. Bishop Kallistos Ware says, \"The service is sung, even though there may be no choir... In the Orthodox Church today, as in the early Church, singing is unaccompanied and instrumental music is not found.\"<ref name=Ware>{{harvnb|Ware|1997|p=268}}</ref> This a cappella behavior arises from strict interpretation of Psalms 150, which states, ''Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.''<ref>{{bibleverse||Psalms|150:6}}</ref> In keeping with this philosophy, early Russian ''musika'' which started appearing in the late 17th century, in what was known as ''khorov\u00efye kontsert\u00ef'' (choral concertos) made a cappella adaptations of Venetian-styled pieces, such as the treatise, ''Grammatika musikiyskaya'' (1675), by [[Nikolai Diletsky]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005b|p=234}}</ref> Divine Liturgies and Western Rite masses composed by famous composers such as [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Tchaikovsky)|Peter Tchaikovsky]], [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Rachmaninoff)|Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Alexander Arkhangelsky (composer)|Alexander Arkhangelsky]], and [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Leontovych)|Mykola Leontovych]] are fine examples of this.\n\n====Opposition to instruments in worship====\nPresent-day Christian religious bodies known for conducting their worship services without musical accompaniment include many [[Anabaptist]] communities (such as the [[Amish]], [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], [[Old Order Mennonites]] and [[Conservative Mennonites]]), some [[Presbyterian]] churches devoted to the [[regulative principle of worship]], [[Old Regular Baptist]]s, [[Primitive Baptist]]s, [[Plymouth Brethren]], [[Churches of Christ]], Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma), the [[Reformed Free Methodist Church|Reformed Free Methodists]],<ref name=\"Jones1974\">{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Charles Edwin |title=A guide to the study of the holiness movement |date=1974 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0810807037 |page=[https://archive.org/details/guidetostudyoft00char/page/685 685] |language=English |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetostudyoft00char/page/685 }}</ref> [[Doukhobor]]s, and the [[Byzantine Rite]] of Eastern Christianity. Certain [[high church]] services and other musical events in liturgical churches (such as the Roman Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]]) may be a cappella, a practice remaining from apostolic times. Many [[Mennonite]]s also conduct some or all of their services without instruments. [[Sacred Harp]], a type of [[folk music]], is an a cappella style of religious singing with [[shape notes]], usually sung at singing conventions.\n\nOpponents of [[musical instruments in the Christian worship]] believe that such opposition is supported by the Christian scriptures and Church history. The scriptures typically referenced are [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026:30;%20Acts%2016:25;%20Romans%2015:9;%201%20Corinthians%2014:15;%20Ephesians%205:19;%20Colossians%203:16;%20Hebrews%202:12,%13:15;%20James%205:13;&version=49; Matthew 26:30; Acts 16:25; Romans 15:9; 1 Corinthians 14:15; Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16; Hebrews 2:12, 13:15; James 5:13], which show examples and exhortations for Christians to sing.<ref name=kurfees>{{harvnb|Kurfees|1911}}</ref>\n\nThere is no reference to instrumental music in early church worship in the New Testament, or in the worship of churches for the first six centuries.<ref name=McKinnon>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1965|pp=263, 265}}</ref><ref name=Bales>{{harvnb|Bales|1973|p=351}}</ref> Several reasons have been posited throughout church history for the absence of instrumental music in church worship.{{refn|group=\"nb\"|The absence of instrumental music is rooted in various hermeneutic principles (ways of interpreting the Bible) which determine what is appropriate for worship. Among such principles are the [[regulative principle of worship]] (Ulrich Zwingli), [[Sola scriptura]] (Martin Luther and Ulrich Zwingli), and the history of [[hymn]] in \"Christianity\". Dispensationalism emphasizes the differences between the old (Law of Moses) and the new (Jesus and the Apostles) covenants, emphasizing that the majority of the practices from the Law of Moses were replaced by the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles. The absence of instrumental music in early church worship is significant given the abundance of Hebrew Bible references and commands to worship God with harp, lyre and cymbal. After several hundred years of Tabernacle worship without references to instrumental music, King David (c. 1500 BC) introduced musical instruments into Temple worship reportedly because of a commandment from God, complete with who was to sing, who was to play, and what instruments were to be used.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25-29}}</ref>}}\n\nChristians who believe in a cappella music today believe that in the Israelite worship assembly during Temple worship only the Priests of Levi sang, played, and offered animal sacrifices, whereas in the church era, all Christians are commanded to sing praises to God. They believe that if God wanted instrumental music in New Testament worship, He would have commanded not just singing, but singing and playing like he did in the Hebrew scriptures.\n\nThe first recorded example of a musical instrument in Roman Catholic worship was a [[pipe organ]] introduced by [[Pope Vitalian]] into a cathedral in Rome around 670.<ref>American Encyclopedia, Volume 12, p. 688{{title missing}}</ref>{{refn|group=\"nb\"|McKinnon maintained that the organ was the first instrument to be introduced into worship and the next was the trumpet. He noted accounts of an organ being sent from Byzantium to Pippin in 757, and another to Charlemagne in 812.<ref>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1965|p=265}}</ref>}}\n\nInstruments have divided Christendom since their introduction into worship. They were considered a Catholic innovation, not widely practiced until the 18th century, and were opposed vigorously in worship by a number of [[Protestant Reformers]], including [[Martin Luther]] (1483\u20131546),<ref name=M&S>{{harvnb|M'Clintock|Strong|1894|p=762}}</ref> [[Ulrich Zwingli]], [[John Calvin]] (1509\u20131564)<ref name=Calvin>{{harvnb|Calvin|2009}}</ref> and [[John Wesley]] (1703\u20131791).<ref name=Clarke>{{harvnb|Clarke|1844|p=684}}</ref> Alexander Campbell referred to the use of an instrument in worship as \"a cow bell in a concert\".<ref name=ferg>{{harvnb|Ferguson|2004|p=414}}</ref> In [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'', the heroine, [[Jeanie Deans]], a Scottish Presbyterian, writes to her father about the church situation she has found in England (bold added):\n:The folk here are civil, and, like the barbarians unto the holy apostle, have shown me much kindness; and there are a sort of chosen people in the land, for they have some '''[[kirk]]s without organs that are like ours''', and are called meeting-houses, where the minister preaches without a gown.<ref name=Scott>{{harvnb|Scott|1818}}</ref>\n\n====Acceptance of instruments in worship====\nThose who do not adhere to the [[regulative principle]] of interpreting Christian scripture, believe that limiting praise to the unaccompanied chant of the early church is not commanded in scripture, and that churches in any age are free to offer their songs with or without musical instruments.\n\nThose who subscribe to this interpretation believe that since the Christian scriptures never counter instrumental language with any negative judgment on instruments, opposition to instruments instead comes from an interpretation of history. There is no written opposition to musical instruments in any setting in the first century and a half of Christian churches (33\u2013180 AD).<ref name=McKinnon2>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1989|p=2}}</ref> The use of instruments for Christian worship during this period is also undocumented. Toward the end of the 2nd century, Christians began condemning the instruments themselves.<ref name=McKinnon3>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1998|p=72}}</ref> Those who oppose instruments today believe these Church Fathers had a better understanding of God's desire for the church,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} but there are significant differences between the teachings of these Church Fathers and Christian opposition to instruments today.\n* Modern Christians typically believe it is acceptable to play instruments or to attend weddings, funerals, banquets, etc., where instruments are heard playing religious music. The Church Fathers made no exceptions.<ref name=McKinnon3/> Since the New Testament never condemns instruments themselves, much less in any of these settings, it is believed that \"the church Fathers go beyond the New Testament in pronouncing a negative judgment on musical instruments.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|p=74}}</ref>\n* Written opposition to instruments in worship began near the turn of the 5th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|pp=52, 53}}</ref> Modern opponents of instruments typically do not make the same assessment of instruments as these writers,{{refn|group=\"nb\"|Rather than calling the use of instruments \"evil\", modern opposition typically uses terms like \"unspiritual\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|p=88}}</ref> or an Old Testament \"shadow\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|Lewis|West|1984|p=109}}</ref>}} who argued that God had allowed David the \"evil\" of using musical instruments in praise.<ref>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1989|p=7}}</ref> While the Old Testament teaches that God specifically asked for musical instruments,<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25}}</ref> modern concern is for worship based on the New Testament.\n\nSince \"a cappella\" singing brought a new polyphony (more than one note at a time) with instrumental accompaniment, it is not surprising that Protestant reformers who opposed the instruments (such as Calvin and Zwingli) also opposed the polyphony.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss|Taruskin|1984|p=107}}</ref> While Zwingli was destroying organs in Switzerland&nbsp;\u2013 Luther called him a fanatic&nbsp;\u2013 the Church of England was burning books of polyphony.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss|Taruskin|1984|p=109}}</ref>\n\nSome [[Holiness Churches]] such as the [[Free Methodist Church]] opposed the use of musical instruments in church worship until the mid-20th century. The Free Methodist Church allowed for local church decision on the use of either an organ or piano in the 1943 Conference before lifting the ban entirely in 1955. The [[Reformed Free Methodist Church]] and [[Evangelical Wesleyan Church]] were formed as a result of a schism with the Free Methodist Church, with the former retaining a cappella worship and the latter retaining the rule limiting the number of instruments in the church to the piano and organ.<ref name=\"Jones1974\"/>\n\n===Jewish===\nWhile worship in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] included musical instruments ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25\u201329:27}}), traditional Jewish religious services in the Synagogue, both before and after the last destruction of the Temple, did not include musical instruments<ref>{{harvnb|Price|2005|p=68}}</ref> given the practice of scriptural [[cantillation]].<ref>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1998|p=85}}</ref> The use of musical instruments is traditionally forbidden on the Sabbath out of concern that players would be tempted to repair (or tune) their instruments, which is forbidden on those days. (This prohibition has been relaxed in many Reform and some Conservative congregations.) Similarly, when Jewish families and larger groups sing traditional Sabbath songs known as [[zemirot]] outside the context of formal religious services, they usually do so a cappella, and Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations on the Sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles. During [[the Three Weeks]] musical instruments are prohibited. Many Jews consider a portion of the 49-day period of the [[Counting of the Omer|counting of the omer]] between Passover and Shavuot to be a time of semi-mourning and instrumental music is not allowed during that time.<ref>{{harvnb|Melamed|2013}}</ref> This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as ''sefirah'' music.<ref name=\"Shircago\">{{harvnb|Shircago|2013}}</ref>\n\nThe popularization of the Jewish chant may be found in the writings of the Jewish philosopher [[Philo]], born 20 BC. Weaving together Jewish and Greek thought, Philo promoted praise without instruments, and taught that \"silent singing\" (without even vocal chords) was better still.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|pp=39\u201341}}</ref> This view parted with the Jewish scriptures, where Israel offered praise with instruments by God's own command ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25}}).

Based on democratic principles which continue to this day, [http://www.harmonyinc.org Harmony, Inc.] is smaller than its counterpart, but has an atmosphere of friendship and competition. With about 2,500 members in the United States and Canada, Harmony, Inc. uses the same rules in contest that the Barbershop Harmony Society uses. Harmony, Inc. is registered in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n===Amateur and high school===\nThe popularity of a cappella among high schools and amateurs was revived by television shows and movies such as ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' and ''[[Pitch Perfect (film series)|Pitch Perfect]]''. High school groups may have conductors or student leaders who keep the tempo for the group, or beatboxers/vocal percussionists.\n\n==In other countries==\n{{expand section|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Pakistan===\nThe musical show ''Strepsils Stereo'' is credited for introducing the art of a cappella in [[Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1178175 |title=Strepsils Stereo brings A Capella to Pakistan for the first time |work=Dawn |date=11 August 2017 |accessdate=9 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nComposer [[Dinesh Subasinghe]] became the first [[Sri Lanka]]n to write a cappella pieces for [[SATB]] choirs.

This movement has been bolstered by organisations such as [[The Voice Festival UK]].\n\n==Collegiate==\n{{main|Collegiate a cappella|List of collegiate a cappella groups|List of collegiate a cappella groups in the UK}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\nIt is not clear exactly where collegiate a cappella began. The Rensselyrics of [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (formerly known as the RPI Glee Club), established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://issuu.com/tcdigitalrepository/docs/2014spring |magazine=Trinity Reporter |date=Spring 2014 |page=18|title=Perfect Harmony |via=issu.com |quote=founded in the 19th century |first=Jim H. |last=Smith }}</ref>{{additional citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=RPI glee club founding year not specified}} However the longest continuously-singing group is probably [[The Whiffenpoofs]] of [[Yale University]],<ref name=Yale>{{harvnb|Anon|1999}}</ref> which was formed in 1909 and once included [[Cole Porter]] as a member.<ref name=Yale /> Collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century. Some notable historical groups formed along the way include [[Colgate University]]'s [[The Colgate Thirteen|The Colgate 13]] (1942), [[Dartmouth College]]'s Aires (1946), [[Cornell University]]'s Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the [[University of Maine]] Maine Steiners (1958), the [[Columbia University]] Kingsmen (1949), the [http://www.jabberwocks.com Jabberwocks] of [[Brown University]] (1949), and the [[University of Rochester]] YellowJackets (1956).\n\nAll-women a cappella groups followed shortly, frequently as a [[parody]] of the men's groups: the [[Smiffenpoofs]] of [[Smith College]] (1936), The Shwiffs of Connecticut College (The She-Whiffenpoofs, 1944), and [[The Chattertocks of Brown University]] (1951). A cappella groups exploded in popularity beginning in the 1990s, fueled in part by a change in style popularized by the [[Beelzebubs|Tufts University Beelzebubs]] and the [[Dear Abbeys|Boston University Dear Abbeys]]. The new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments, including [[vocal percussion]]/\"[[beatboxing]]\". Some larger universities now have multiple groups. Groups often join one another in on-campus concerts, such as [[the Georgetown Chimes]]' Cherry Tree Massacre, a 3-weekend a cappella festival held each February since 1975, where over a hundred collegiate groups have appeared, as well as [[List of quartet champions by year|International Quartet Champions]] [[Boston Common (quartet)|The Boston Common]] and the contemporary commercial a cappella group [[Rockapella]]. Co-ed groups have produced many up-and-coming and major artists, including [[John Legend]], an alumnus of the Counterparts at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Sara Bareilles]], an alumna of Awaken A Cappella at [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. [[Mira Sorvino]] is an alumna of [[the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones]] of [[Harvard College]], where she had the solo on [[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]] by [[Yazoo (band)|Yaz]].\n\nA cappella is gaining popularity among South Asians with the emergence of primarily Hindi-English College groups. The first South Asian a cappella group was [[Penn Masala]], founded in 1996 at the University of Pennsylvania. Co-ed South Asian a cappella groups are also gaining in popularity. The first co-ed south Asian a cappella was Anokha, from the [[University of Maryland]], formed in 2001. Also, Dil se, another co-ed a cappella from UC Berkeley, hosts the \"Anahat\" competition at the University of California, Berkeley annually. Maize Mirchi, the co-ed a cappella group from the [[University of Michigan]] hosts \"Sa Re Ga Ma Pella\", an annual South Asian a cappella invitational with various groups from the Midwest. Another South Asian group from the Midwest is Chai Town who is based in the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign.\n\nJewish-interest groups such as [[Queens College]]'s Tizmoret, [[Tufts University]]'s [[Shir Appeal]], [[University of Chicago]]'s Rhythm and Jews, [[Binghamton University]]'s Kaskeset, [[Ohio State University]]'s Meshuganotes, [[Rutgers University]]'s Kol Halayla, [[New York University]]'s Ani V'Ata and [[Yale University]]'s Magevet are also gaining popularity across the U.S.<ref>{{harvnb|Ginsberg|2015}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Altshuler|2013}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Shapiro|2011}}</ref>\n\nIncreased interest in modern a cappella (particularly collegiate a cappella) can be seen in the growth of awards such as the Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards (overseen by the [[Contemporary A Cappella Society]]) and competitions such as the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella]] for college groups and the [[Harmony Sweepstakes]] for all groups. In December 2009, a new television competition series called ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' aired on [[NBC]]. The show featured eight a cappella groups from the United States and Puerto Rico vying for the prize of $100,000 and a recording contract with [[Epic Records]]/[[Sony Music]]. The show was judged by [[Ben Folds]], [[Shawn Stockman]], and [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and was won by an all-male group from Puerto Rico called [[Nota (group)|Nota]]. The show returned for a second, third and fourth season, won by [[Committed (group)|Committed]], [[Pentatonix]] and [[Home Free (group)|Home Free]] respectively.\n\nEach year, hundreds of Collegiate a cappella groups submit their strongest songs in a competition to be on The Best of College A Cappella (BOCA), an album compilation of tracks from the best college a cappella groups around the world. The album is produced by Varsity Vocals&nbsp;\u2013 which also produces the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella&nbsp;\u2013 and [[Deke Sharon]]. ). According to ethnomusicologist Joshua S. Dunchan, \"BOCA carries considerable cache and respect within the field despite the appearance of other compilations in part, perhaps, because of its longevity and the prestige of the individuals behind it.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dunchan|first=Joshua|date=2012|title=Recordings, Technology, and Discourse in Collegiate A Cappella|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/490098|journal=Journal of American Folklore|volume=125|issue=498|pages=488\u2013502|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.5406/jamerfolk.125.498.0488}}</ref>\n\nCollegiate a cappella groups may also submit their tracks to Voices Only, a two-disc series released at the beginning of each school year. A Voices Only album has been released every year since 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, all women's a cappella groups can send their strongest song tracks to the Women's A Cappella Association (WACA) for its annual best of women's a cappella album. WACA offers another medium for women's voices to receive recognition and has released an album every year since 2014, featuring women's groups from across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Women's A Cappella Association |url=http://www.womensacappella.org/#!recordings/cfpt |website=Women's A Cappella Association |access-date=4 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Emulating instruments==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nIn addition to singing words, some a cappella singers also emulate instrumentation by reproducing instrumental sounds with their [[vocal cords]] and mouth, often pitched using specialised pitch pipes. One of the earliest 20th century practitioners of this method were [[The Mills Brothers]] whose early recordings of the 1930s clearly stated on the label that all instrumentation was done vocally. More recently, \"[[Twilight Zone (dance song)|Twilight Zone]]\" by [[2 Unlimited]] was sung a cappella to the instrumentation on the comedy television series ''Tompkins Square''. Another famous example of emulating instrumentation instead of singing the words is the theme song for ''[[The New Addams Family]]'' series on [[Fox Family Channel]] (now [[ABC Family]]). Groups such as [[Vocal Sampling]] and Undivided emulate Latin rhythms a cappella. In the 1960s, the Swingle Singers used their voices to emulate musical instruments to Baroque and Classical music. Vocal artist [[Bobby McFerrin]] is famous for his instrumental emulation. A cappella group [[Naturally Seven]] recreates entire songs using vocal tones for every instrument.\n\nThe [[Swingle Singers]] used nonsense words to sound like instruments, but have been known to produce non-verbal versions of musical instruments. [[Beatboxing]], more accurately known as vocal percussion, is a technique used in a cappella music popularized by the [[hip-hop]] community, where [[Rapping|rap]] is often performed a cappella also. The advent of vocal percussion added new dimensions to the a cappella genre and has become very prevalent in modern arrangements.<ref>{{harvnb|Pauley|2012}}</ref> Jazz vocalist [[Petra Haden]] used a four-track recorder to produce an a cappella version of ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' including the instruments and fake advertisements on her album ''[[Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out]]'' in 2005. Haden has also released a cappella versions of [[Journey (band)|Journey]]'s \"[[Don't Stop Believin']]\", [[The Beach Boys]]' \"[[God Only Knows]]\" and [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]\".\n\nChristian rock group [[Relient K]] recorded the song \"Plead the Fifth\" a cappella on its album ''[[Five Score and Seven Years Ago]]''. The group recorded lead singer [[Matt Thiessen]] making drum noises and played them with an electronic drum machine to record the song.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lists of a cappella groups]]\n** [[List of professional a cappella groups]]\n** [[List of collegiate a cappella groups|List of collegiate a cappella groups in the United States]]\n** [[List of university a cappella groups in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite web|last=Alleman|first=Annie|url=http://heraldnews.suntimes.com/entertainment/8071132-421/chicago-a-cappella-sings-music-of-high-holidays.html|title=Chicago a cappella sings music of high holidays|year=2011|work=Chicago Sun times|location=Chicago, Illinois|ref=harv|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124121724/http://heraldnews.suntimes.com/entertainment/8071132-421/chicago-a-cappella-sings-music-of-high-holidays.html|archivedate=24 January 2012}}\n* {{cite news |last=Altshuler |first=George |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/67365/singers-find-sure-appeal-of-jewish-a-cappella-groups/ |title=Singers find sure appeal of Jewish a cappella groups |newspaper=[[j.

The contestants in turn each receive 5 questions regarding their specialist subject areas (\"The Experts' Round\"), followed by questions from a subject Gleeson chooses (\"Tom's Round\") and then [[general knowledge]] questions (\"The People's Round\"). Contestants receive 5 points for answering a question correctly, and lose 5 points for answering a question incorrectly.  During the Experts' Round, a contestant may attempt to answer a question from another contestant's subject area. This is known as \"The Steal\". If a Steal is successful, the contestant receives 10 points but will only lose 5 points for an incorrect Steal attempt (in series 1, a failed Steal resulted in the contestant losing 10 points).  The contestant with the lowest score at the end of both the Experts Round and The People's Round are eliminated from the show. In the event of a tie for lowest scorer, the tie is broken with a Hard-Off, where Gleeson presents two options for a given question (often pertaining to the relative difficulty of two given tasks or physical hardness of two materials), which the first contestant to buzz in then answers. If the answering contestant chooses correctly, the other contestant is eliminated and vice versa if the answer given is incorrect. The final two contestants answer questions regarding their chosen subject area in a best of 5 [[penalty shootout]]-style format, with the winner receiving a trophy \u2013 the Hard Quiz Big Brass Mug.\n\n==Series Overview==\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n| color1     = skyblue\n| link1      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 1 (2016)\n| episodes1  = 10\n| start1     = {{Start date|2016|10|19|df=y}}\n| end1       = {{End date|2016|12|21|df=y}}\n\n| color2     = orange\n| link2      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 2 (2017)\n| episodes2  = 18\n| start2     = {{Start date|2017|8|2|df=y}}\n| end2       = {{End date|2017|11|29|df=y}}\n\n| color3     = #C8A2C8\n| link3      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 3 (2018-19)\n| episodes3  = 22\n| start3     = {{Start date|2018|2|21|df=y}}\n| end3       = {{End date|2019|1|30|df=y}}\n\n| color4     = #FBCEB1\n| link4      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 4 (2019)\n| episodes4  = 20 + [[<includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#ep71|1 Special]]\n| start4     = {{Start date|2019|2|6|df=y}}\n| end4       = {{End date|2019|10|2|df=y}}\n\n| color5     = #9D296E\n| link5      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 5 (2020)\n| episodes5  = 40<ref name=\"TVBlackbox\" />\n| start5     = {{Start date|2020|2|5|df=y}}\n| end5       = \n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series 1 (2016)===\n\n''Names in '''Bold''' are the winners''\n{{Episode table |total_width=70 |background=skyblue |overall=5 |title=16 |viewers=16 |airdate=16 |viewersT=Australian viewers |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| RTitle          = \"Episode 1\"\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|19|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 681,000<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Timeshifted: Wednesday 19 October 2016|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2016/10/timeshifted-wednesday-19-october-2016.html|website=TV Tonight|date=29 October 2016|accessdate=15 November 2016}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Quizzers:<br>Sue -

The contestants in turn each receive 5 questions regarding their specialist subject areas (\"The Experts' Round\"), followed by questions from a subject Gleeson chooses (\"Tom's Round\") and then [[general knowledge]] questions (\"The People's Round\"). Contestants receive 5 points for answering a question correctly, and lose 5 points for answering a question incorrectly.  During the Experts' Round, a contestant may attempt to answer a question from another contestant's subject area. This is known as \"The Steal\". If a Steal is successful, the contestant receives 10 points but will only lose 5 points for an incorrect Steal attempt (in series 1, a failed Steal resulted in the contestant losing 10 points).  The contestant with the lowest score at the end of both the Experts Round and The People's Round are eliminated from the show. In the event of a tie for lowest scorer, the tie is broken with a Hard-Off, where Gleeson presents two options for a given question (often pertaining to the relative difficulty of two given tasks or physical hardness of two materials), which the first contestant to buzz in then answers. If the answering contestant chooses correctly, the other contestant is eliminated and vice versa if the answer given is incorrect. The final two contestants answer questions regarding their chosen subject area in a best of 5 [[penalty shootout]]-style format, with the winner receiving a trophy \u2013 the Hard Quiz Big Brass Mug.\n\n==Series Overview==\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n| color1     = skyblue\n| link1      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 1 (2016)\n| episodes1  = 10\n| start1     = {{Start date|2016|10|19|df=y}}\n| end1       = {{End date|2016|12|21|df=y}}\n\n| color2     = orange\n| link2      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 2 (2017)\n| episodes2  = 18\n| start2     = {{Start date|2017|8|2|df=y}}\n| end2       = {{End date|2017|11|29|df=y}}\n\n| color3     = #C8A2C8\n| link3      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 3 (2018-19)\n| episodes3  = 22\n| start3     = {{Start date|2018|2|21|df=y}}\n| end3       = {{End date|2019|1|30|df=y}}\n\n| color4     = #FBCEB1\n| link4      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 4 (2019)\n| episodes4  = 20 + [[<includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#ep71|1 Special]]\n| start4     = {{Start date|2019|2|6|df=y}}\n| end4       = {{End date|2019|10|2|df=y}}\n\n| color5     = #9D296E\n| link5      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 5 (2020)\n| episodes5  = 40<ref name=\"TVBlackbox\" />\n| start5     = {{Start date|2020|2|5|df=y}}\n| end5       = \n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series 1 (2016)===\n\n''Names in '''Bold''' are the winners''\n{{Episode table |total_width=70 |background=skyblue |overall=5 |title=16 |viewers=16 |airdate=16 |viewersT=Australian viewers |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| RTitle          = \"Episode 1\"\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|19|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 681,000<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Timeshifted: Wednesday 19 October 2016|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2016/10/timeshifted-wednesday-19-october-2016.html|website=TV Tonight|date=29 October 2016|accessdate=15 November 2016}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Quizzers:<br>Sue -

Part of this disagreement resulted from a long tradition of competition between the four main oceanographic institutions: [[Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory|Lamont Geological Observatory]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] in [[Massachusetts]], the [[University of Miami]] in Florida, and the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in California.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> The competitive nature of these institutions meant that they often refused to cooperate. The East Coast institutions favoured a drilling site in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] or [[Caribbean]], while Scripps in [[San Diego]] favoured a [[North Pacific]] site.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> Any site had to be near a large port to make the logistics of the large expedition feasible, it had to have a Moho as shallow as possible, it could not be in a geologically active region, and it had to have stable weather conditions.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> In January 1965 a site north of [[Maui, Hawaii]], was selected.<ref name=\"E.Shor\"/>\n\nA critical dispute was whether Mohole should begin at a modest, conservative pace with a program of drilling shallow bore holes in sediments, or whether it should proceed at once to drill the deep hole to the Moho.<ref name=\"Winterer\"/> The issue was critical since the two approaches required differing engineering, management, and allocation of resources. There was significant interest in a program of shallower holes from those in the [[oceanography|oceanographic community]] and the [[oil industry]]. The deeper hole addressed more fundamental questions about the structure of the Earth.

Part of this disagreement resulted from a long tradition of competition between the four main oceanographic institutions: [[Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory|Lamont Geological Observatory]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] in [[Massachusetts]], the [[University of Miami]] in Florida, and the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in California.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> The competitive nature of these institutions meant that they often refused to cooperate. The East Coast institutions favoured a drilling site in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] or [[Caribbean]], while Scripps in [[San Diego]] favoured a [[North Pacific]] site.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> Any site had to be near a large port to make the logistics of the large expedition feasible, it had to have a Moho as shallow as possible, it could not be in a geologically active region, and it had to have stable weather conditions.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> In January 1965 a site north of [[Maui, Hawaii]], was selected.<ref name=\"E.Shor\"/>\n\nA critical dispute was whether Mohole should begin at a modest, conservative pace with a program of drilling shallow bore holes in sediments, or whether it should proceed at once to drill the deep hole to the Moho.<ref name=\"Winterer\"/> The issue was critical since the two approaches required differing engineering, management, and allocation of resources. There was significant interest in a program of shallower holes from those in the [[oceanography|oceanographic community]] and the [[oil industry]]. The deeper hole addressed more fundamental questions about the structure of the Earth. Some viewed the more modest initial approach as developing essential engineering and drilling techniques that would later be required for the deep bore hole.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/>\n\nSome in the [[geology]] and [[geophysics]] communities objected to Mohole because, for its enormous cost, they expected that not much would be learned from drilling. They viewed the project as an engineering stunt of little scientific value.<ref name=\"G.Lill\"/>\n\n=== Management ===\nDuring the CUSS I test and shortly thereafter, the Mohole project was managed by the National Academy of Sciences, with AMSOC acting as an advisor. The informal AMSOC group was insufficient to manage what was expected to be a large project in its next phase, and the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) took over management of the project in late 1961.<ref name=\"Greenberg 2\">{{Cite journal |first1=D.S. |last1=Greenberg |date= January 17, 1964 |title=Mohole: The project that went awry (II) |journal=Science |volume=143 |issue=3603 |pages=223\u2013227| doi=10.1126/science.143.3603.223|pmid=17753144 |bibcode=1964Sci...143..223G }}</ref><ref name=\"Greenberg 3\">{{Cite journal |first1=D.S. |last1=Greenberg |date= January 24, 1964 |title=Mohole: The project that went awry (III) |journal=Science |volume=143 |issue=3604 |pages=334\u2013337| doi=10.1126/science.143.3604.334|bibcode=1964Sci...143..334G }}</ref> AMSOC was retained as an advisor to NSF.

For example, the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] (WISC), originally developed in 1949, was updated in 1974, 1991, 2003 and again in 2014. The revised versions are [[standardized]] based on the performance of test-takers in standardization samples. A standard score of IQ 100 is defined as the median performance of the standardization sample. Thus one way to see changes in norms over time is to conduct a study in which the same test-takers take both an old and new version of the same test. Doing so confirms IQ gains over time. Some IQ tests, for example tests used for military draftees in [[NATO]] countries in Europe, report raw scores, and those also confirm a trend of rising scores over time. The average rate of increase seems to be about three IQ points per decade in the United States, as scaled by the Wechsler tests. The increasing test performance over time appears on every major test, in every age range, at every ability level, and in every modern industrialized country, although not necessarily at the same rate as in the United States.

Because children attend school longer now and have become much more familiar with the testing of school-related material, one might expect the greatest gains to occur on such school content-related tests as [[vocabulary]], [[arithmetic]] or general information. Just the opposite is the case: abilities such as these have experienced relatively small gains and even occasional decreases over the years. Meta-analytic findings indicate that Flynn effects occur for tests assessing both fluid and crystallized abilities. For example, Dutch conscripts gained 21 points during only 30 years, or 7 points per decade, between 1952 and 1982.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/> But this rise in IQ test scores is not wholly explained by an increase in general intelligence.

Genetic changes were seen as not important.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2016.10.061 Rindermann, et al., 2017]</ref> The experts' views agreed with an independently performed<ref>According to Rinderman et al., chapter 4</ref> meta-analysis on published Flynn effect data, except that the latter found [[life history theory|life history speed]] to be the most important factor.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691615577701 Pietschnig and Voracek, 2015.]</ref>\n\nThe expert survey explained the possible end or decline in the Flynn effect by asymmetric fertility by means of genetic effects, migration, asymmetric fertility by means of socialization effects, declines in education, and the influence of media.\n\n===Schooling and test familiarity===\nDuration of average schooling has increased steadily. One problem with this explanation is that if in the US comparing older and more recent subjects with similar educational levels, then the IQ gains appear almost undiminished in each such group considered individually.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\nMany studies find that children who do not attend school score drastically lower on the tests than their regularly attending peers. During the 1960s, when some [[Virginia]] counties [[Massive resistance|closed their public schools to avoid racial integration]], compensatory private schooling was available only for Caucasian children. On average, the scores of African-American children who received no formal education during that period decreased at a rate of about six IQ points per year.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\nAnother explanation is an increased familiarity of the general population with tests and testing. For example, children who take the very same IQ test a second time usually gain five or six points. However, this seems to set an upper limit on the effects of test sophistication. One problem with this explanation and others related to schooling is that in the US, the groups with greater test familiarity show smaller IQ increases.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\n[[Early intervention]] programs have shown mixed results. Some preschool (ages 3\u20134) intervention programs like \"[[Head Start Program|Head Start]]\" do not produce lasting changes of IQ, although they may confer other benefits.{{which|date=July 2014}} The \"[[Abecedarian Early Intervention Project]]\", an all-day program that provided various forms of [[Environmental enrichment (neural)|environmental enrichment]] to children from infancy onward, showed IQ gains that did not diminish over time. The IQ difference between the groups, although only five points, was still present at age 12. Not all such projects have been successful.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/> Also, such IQ gains can diminish until age 18.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Plomin R. |author2=DeFries J.C. |author3=Craig I.W. |author4=McGuffin P. |title=Behavioral genetics in the postgenomic era |year=2003 |edition=4th }}</ref>\n\nCiting a high correlation between rising literacy rates and gains in IQ, [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] has argued that the Flynn effect is caused by changes in literacy rates.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2466/pr0.106.3.643-664 |author=David F Marks|title=IQ variations across time, race, and nationality:an artifact of differences in literacy skills|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=106 |issue=3|pages=643\u201364|year=2010 |pmid=20712152|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/888e97997b7e08afe236abc8d60eecc1b1fa24df}}</ref>\n\n===Generally more stimulating environment===\nStill another theory is that the general environment today is much more complex and stimulating. One of the most striking 20th-century changes of the human intellectual environment has come from the increase of exposure to many types of [[visual media]]. From pictures on the wall to movies to television to video games to computers, each successive generation has been exposed to richer optical displays than the one before and may have become more adept at visual analysis. This would explain why visual tests like the Raven's have shown the greatest increases. An increase only of particular forms of intelligence would explain why the Flynn effect has not caused a \"cultural renaissance too great to be overlooked.\"<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\nIn 2001, Dickens and Flynn presented a model for resolving several contradictory findings regarding IQ. They argue that the measure \"[[heritability]]\" includes both a direct effect of the [[genotype]] on IQ and also indirect effects such that the genotype changes the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], thereby affecting IQ. That is, those with a greater IQ tend to seek stimulating environments that further increase IQ. These reciprocal effects result in [[gene environment correlation]]. The direct effect could initially have been very small, but [[feedback]] can create large differences of IQ. In their model, an environmental stimulus can have a very great effect on IQ, even for adults, but this effect also decays over time unless the stimulus continues (the model could be adapted to include possible factors, like nutrition during early childhood, that may cause permanent effects). The Flynn effect can be explained by a generally more stimulating environment for all people. The authors suggest that any program designed to increase IQ may produce long-term IQ gains if that program teaches children how to replicate the types of cognitively demanding experiences that produce IQ gains outside the program. To maximize lifetime IQ, the programs should also motivate them to continue searching for cognitively demanding experiences after they have left the program.<ref name=Dickens01>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.346 |vauthors=Dickens WT, Flynn JR |title=Heritability estimates versus large environmental effects: The IQ paradox resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=346\u2013369 |year=2001 |pmid=11381833 |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/u81/Dickens_and_Flynn__2001_.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.139.2436 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Dickens WT, Flynn JR |title=The IQ Paradox: Still Resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=109 |issue=4 |year=2002 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.109.4.764 |pages=764\u201371 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319031706/http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |archivedate=March 19, 2007  }}</ref>\n\nFlynn in his 2007 book ''[[What Is Intelligence?]]'' further expanded on this theory. Environmental changes resulting from modernization\u2014such as more intellectually demanding work, greater use of technology and smaller families\u2014have meant that a much larger proportion of people are more accustomed to manipulating abstract concepts such as hypotheses and categories than a century ago. Substantial portions of IQ tests deal with these abilities. Flynn gives, as an example, the question 'What do a dog and a rabbit have in common?' A modern respondent might say they are both mammals (an abstract, or ''a priori'' answer, which depends only on the meanings of the words ''dog'' and ''rabbit''), whereas someone a century ago might have said that humans catch rabbits with dogs (a concrete, or ''a posteriori'' answer, which depended on what happened to be the case at that time).\n\n===Nutrition===\nImproved nutrition is another possible explanation. Today's average adult from an industrialized nation is taller than a comparable adult of a century ago. That increase of stature, likely the result of general improvements of nutrition and health, has been at a rate of more than a centimeter per decade. Available data suggest that these gains have been accompanied by analogous increases of head size, and by an increase in the average size of the brain.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Jantz |first=R. |last2=Meadows Jantz |first2=L. |year=2000 |title=Secular change in craniofacial morphology |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |volume=12 |issue= 3|pages=327\u201338 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6300(200005/06)12:3<327::AID-AJHB3>3.0.CO;2-1 |pmid=11534023}}</ref> This argument had been thought to suffer the difficulty that groups who tend to be of smaller overall body size (e.g. women, or people of Asian ancestry) do not have lower average IQs.<ref name=TO1987/> [[Richard Lynn]], however, claims that while people of East Asian origin may often have smaller bodies, they tend to have larger brains and higher IQs than average whites.<ref name=Lynn>Lynn, Richard (2006).

Lynn states that \"This rules out improvements in education, greater test sophistication, etc. and most of the other factors that have been proposed to explain the Flynn effect.

For the upper half of the results the performance was even worse. Average IQ scores declined by six points. However, children aged between five and 10 saw their IQs increase by up to half a point a year over the three decades. Flynn argues that the abnormal drop in British teenage IQ could be due to youth culture having \"stagnated\" or even dumbed down. He also states that the youth culture is more oriented towards computer games than towards reading and holding conversations. Researcher Richard Gray, commenting on the study, also mentions the computer culture diminishing reading books as well as a tendency towards [[teaching to the test]].<ref>{{cite news |title=British teenagers have lower IQs than their counterparts did 30 years ago |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/4548943/British-teenagers-have-lower-IQs-than-their-counterparts-did-30-years-ago.html |journal=The Telegraph |date=February 7, 2009 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Gray}}</ref><ref name=\"requiem\">{{Cite journal| pmc = | doi = 10.1016/j.ehb.2009.01.009 | pmid =   19251490| last1 = Flynn | first1 = J.R. | title = Requiem for nutrition as the cause of IQ gains: Raven's gains in Britain 1938\u20132008 | journal = Economics & Human Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 18\u201327 | year = 2009 }}</ref>\n\nLynn and Harvey argued in 2008 that the causes of the above are difficult to interpret since these countries had had significant recent immigration from countries with lower average national IQs. Nevertheless, they expect that similar patterns will occur, or have occurred, first in other developed nations and then in the developing world as there is a limit to how much environmental factors can improve intelligence. Furthermore, during the last century there is a negative correlation between [[fertility and intelligence]] although there is not yet any conclusive evidence of the association between the two.

For example, the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] (WISC), originally developed in 1949, was updated in 1974, 1991, 2003 and again in 2014. The revised versions are [[standardized]] based on the performance of test-takers in standardization samples. A standard score of IQ 100 is defined as the median performance of the standardization sample. Thus one way to see changes in norms over time is to conduct a study in which the same test-takers take both an old and new version of the same test. Doing so confirms IQ gains over time. Some IQ tests, for example tests used for military draftees in [[NATO]] countries in Europe, report raw scores, and those also confirm a trend of rising scores over time. The average rate of increase seems to be about three IQ points per decade in the United States, as scaled by the Wechsler tests. The increasing test performance over time appears on every major test, in every age range, at every ability level, and in every modern industrialized country, although not necessarily at the same rate as in the United States. The increase was continuous and roughly linear from the earliest days of testing to the mid-1990s.<ref name=\"Neisser97\">{{cite journal |author=Neisser U |title=Rising Scores on Intelligence Tests |journal=American Scientist |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=440\u201347 |year=1997 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/rising-scores-on-intelligence-tests/99999 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104214157/http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/rising-scores-on-intelligence-tests/99999 |archivedate=November 4, 2016  |bibcode=1997AmSci..85..440N }}</ref>{{better source|date=November 2017}} Though the effect is most associated with IQ increases, a similar effect has been found with increases in attention and of [[Semantic memory|semantic]] and [[episodic memory]].<ref name=\"R\u00f6nnlund\"/>\n\n[[Ulric Neisser]] estimated that using the IQ values of 1997, the average IQ of the United States in 1932, according to the first [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales]] standardization sample, was 80.

Because children attend school longer now and have become much more familiar with the testing of school-related material, one might expect the greatest gains to occur on such school content-related tests as [[vocabulary]], [[arithmetic]] or general information. Just the opposite is the case: abilities such as these have experienced relatively small gains and even occasional decreases over the years. Meta-analytic findings indicate that Flynn effects occur for tests assessing both fluid and crystallized abilities. For example, Dutch conscripts gained 21 points during only 30 years, or 7 points per decade, between 1952 and 1982.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/> But this rise in IQ test scores is not wholly explained by an increase in general intelligence.

One problem with this explanation is that if in the US comparing older and more recent subjects with similar educational levels, then the IQ gains appear almost undiminished in each such group considered individually.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\nMany studies find that children who do not attend school score drastically lower on the tests than their regularly attending peers. During the 1960s, when some [[Virginia]] counties [[Massive resistance|closed their public schools to avoid racial integration]], compensatory private schooling was available only for Caucasian children. On average, the scores of African-American children who received no formal education during that period decreased at a rate of about six IQ points per year.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\nAnother explanation is an increased familiarity of the general population with tests and testing. For example, children who take the very same IQ test a second time usually gain five or six points. However, this seems to set an upper limit on the effects of test sophistication. One problem with this explanation and others related to schooling is that in the US, the groups with greater test familiarity show smaller IQ increases.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\n[[Early intervention]] programs have shown mixed results. Some preschool (ages 3\u20134) intervention programs like \"[[Head Start Program|Head Start]]\" do not produce lasting changes of IQ, although they may confer other benefits.{{which|date=July 2014}} The \"[[Abecedarian Early Intervention Project]]\", an all-day program that provided various forms of [[Environmental enrichment (neural)|environmental enrichment]] to children from infancy onward, showed IQ gains that did not diminish over time. The IQ difference between the groups, although only five points, was still present at age 12. Not all such projects have been successful.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/> Also, such IQ gains can diminish until age 18.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Plomin R. |author2=DeFries J.C. |author3=Craig I.W. |author4=McGuffin P. |title=Behavioral genetics in the postgenomic era |year=2003 |edition=4th }}</ref>\n\nCiting a high correlation between rising literacy rates and gains in IQ, [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] has argued that the Flynn effect is caused by changes in literacy rates.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2466/pr0.106.3.643-664 |author=David F Marks|title=IQ variations across time, race, and nationality:an artifact of differences in literacy skills|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=106 |issue=3|pages=643\u201364|year=2010 |pmid=20712152|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/888e97997b7e08afe236abc8d60eecc1b1fa24df}}</ref>\n\n===Generally more stimulating environment===\nStill another theory is that the general environment today is much more complex and stimulating. One of the most striking 20th-century changes of the human intellectual environment has come from the increase of exposure to many types of [[visual media]]. From pictures on the wall to movies to television to video games to computers, each successive generation has been exposed to richer optical displays than the one before and may have become more adept at visual analysis. This would explain why visual tests like the Raven's have shown the greatest increases. An increase only of particular forms of intelligence would explain why the Flynn effect has not caused a \"cultural renaissance too great to be overlooked.\"<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\nIn 2001, Dickens and Flynn presented a model for resolving several contradictory findings regarding IQ. They argue that the measure \"[[heritability]]\" includes both a direct effect of the [[genotype]] on IQ and also indirect effects such that the genotype changes the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], thereby affecting IQ. That is, those with a greater IQ tend to seek stimulating environments that further increase IQ. These reciprocal effects result in [[gene environment correlation]]. The direct effect could initially have been very small, but [[feedback]] can create large differences of IQ. In their model, an environmental stimulus can have a very great effect on IQ, even for adults, but this effect also decays over time unless the stimulus continues (the model could be adapted to include possible factors, like nutrition during early childhood, that may cause permanent effects). The Flynn effect can be explained by a generally more stimulating environment for all people. The authors suggest that any program designed to increase IQ may produce long-term IQ gains if that program teaches children how to replicate the types of cognitively demanding experiences that produce IQ gains outside the program. To maximize lifetime IQ, the programs should also motivate them to continue searching for cognitively demanding experiences after they have left the program.<ref name=Dickens01>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.346 |vauthors=Dickens WT, Flynn JR |title=Heritability estimates versus large environmental effects: The IQ paradox resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=346\u2013369 |year=2001 |pmid=11381833 |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/u81/Dickens_and_Flynn__2001_.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.139.2436 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Dickens WT, Flynn JR |title=The IQ Paradox: Still Resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=109 |issue=4 |year=2002 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.109.4.764 |pages=764\u201371 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319031706/http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |archivedate=March 19, 2007  }}</ref>\n\nFlynn in his 2007 book ''[[What Is Intelligence?]]'' further expanded on this theory. Environmental changes resulting from modernization\u2014such as more intellectually demanding work, greater use of technology and smaller families\u2014have meant that a much larger proportion of people are more accustomed to manipulating abstract concepts such as hypotheses and categories than a century ago. Substantial portions of IQ tests deal with these abilities. Flynn gives, as an example, the question 'What do a dog and a rabbit have in common?' A modern respondent might say they are both mammals (an abstract, or ''a priori'' answer, which depends only on the meanings of the words ''dog'' and ''rabbit''), whereas someone a century ago might have said that humans catch rabbits with dogs (a concrete, or ''a posteriori'' answer, which depended on what happened to be the case at that time).\n\n===Nutrition===\nImproved nutrition is another possible explanation. Today's average adult from an industrialized nation is taller than a comparable adult of a century ago. That increase of stature, likely the result of general improvements of nutrition and health, has been at a rate of more than a centimeter per decade. Available data suggest that these gains have been accompanied by analogous increases of head size, and by an increase in the average size of the brain.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Jantz |first=R. |last2=Meadows Jantz |first2=L. |year=2000 |title=Secular change in craniofacial morphology |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |volume=12 |issue= 3|pages=327\u201338 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6300(200005/06)12:3<327::AID-AJHB3>3.0.CO;2-1 |pmid=11534023}}</ref> This argument had been thought to suffer the difficulty that groups who tend to be of smaller overall body size (e.g. women, or people of Asian ancestry) do not have lower average IQs.<ref name=TO1987/> [[Richard Lynn]], however, claims that while people of East Asian origin may often have smaller bodies, they tend to have larger brains and higher IQs than average whites.<ref name=Lynn>Lynn, Richard (2006).

Lynn states that \"This rules out improvements in education, greater test sophistication, etc. and most of the other factors that have been proposed to explain the Flynn effect.

For the upper half of the results the performance was even worse. Average IQ scores declined by six points. However, children aged between five and 10 saw their IQs increase by up to half a point a year over the three decades. Flynn argues that the abnormal drop in British teenage IQ could be due to youth culture having \"stagnated\" or even dumbed down. He also states that the youth culture is more oriented towards computer games than towards reading and holding conversations. Researcher Richard Gray, commenting on the study, also mentions the computer culture diminishing reading books as well as a tendency towards [[teaching to the test]].<ref>{{cite news |title=British teenagers have lower IQs than their counterparts did 30 years ago |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/4548943/British-teenagers-have-lower-IQs-than-their-counterparts-did-30-years-ago.html |journal=The Telegraph |date=February 7, 2009 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Gray}}</ref><ref name=\"requiem\">{{Cite journal| pmc = | doi = 10.1016/j.ehb.2009.01.009 | pmid =   19251490| last1 = Flynn | first1 = J.R. | title = Requiem for nutrition as the cause of IQ gains: Raven's gains in Britain 1938\u20132008 | journal = Economics & Human Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 18\u201327 | year = 2009 }}</ref>\n\nLynn and Harvey argued in 2008 that the causes of the above are difficult to interpret since these countries had had significant recent immigration from countries with lower average national IQs. Nevertheless, they expect that similar patterns will occur, or have occurred, first in other developed nations and then in the developing world as there is a limit to how much environmental factors can improve intelligence. Furthermore, during the last century there is a negative correlation between [[fertility and intelligence]] although there is not yet any conclusive evidence of the association between the two.
