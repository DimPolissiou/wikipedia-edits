Local resident Nick Sparling is credited as being Adair County's first aviator, in 1909. In 1924, Roy B. \"Cap\" Dodson started the first airport in the area, located on the north edge of Kirksville. However, an airfield at the present location of Kirksville Regional Airport wasn't created until 1930 when the Federal Aviation Administration built a series of emergency landing strips across the nation. With America's entry into [[World War II]], the '''Kirksville Municipal Airport''', as it had been declared in the late 1930s, received a major upgrade from the Civilian Pilots Training Program and the US Army Air Corps War Training Service. In 1942 a paved all-weather landing strip, hangars, a control tower and small restaurant were built; the paved runway was 3870&nbsp;ft until 1968.\n\nThe post-war boom in commercial aviation reached Kirksville in 1960 when [[Ozark Air Lines]] began scheduled flights. The plane was a familiar sight to many World War II veterans, as Ozark used the Douglas DC-3, the civil counterpart of the famed C-47 'Gooney Bird', now in Ozark's white and evergreen instead of Army Air Corps colors. The Ozark route began in Kansas City to Chicago with stops in Kirksville, [[Ottumwa]] and [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], [[Moline, Illinois]]. Airport improvements came after a bond issue was approved by Kirksville voters in 1967. A new six-thousand foot concrete runway was built, as well as a new terminal building and improved hangar facilities. The longer runway was needed for the faster Fairchild prop-jet that began flights to Kirksville in late 1968. Also in the 1960s, Ozark switched Kirksville service from a Kansas City-Chicago route to a Des Moines-to-St. Louis one. With the airport improvements came a new name, '''Clarence Cannon Memorial Airport'''\u2014chosen to honor long-time US Congressman Clarence Cannon of Missouri who had done much to help secure air service and funding for the airport.\n\nDespite nearly a million dollars in facility upgrades and a steady flow of passengers in and out of Kirksville, Ozark Airlines found the route to be financially untenable by the mid-1970s, with their final departure coming on April 23, 1976. Fortunately a local pilot and dentist, Dr. Stephen Barber, has established a small commuter air service, [[Horizon Airways]], in 1972. Horizon was able to help fill the void left by Ozarks departure, eventually expanding to five aircraft and service to both Kansas City and St. Louis.<ref>''A History Of Adair County Missouri'' published by the Kirksville-Adair County Bicentennial Committee, 1976.</ref><ref>'Flying High!' by Tony Frost & Corey Pritchard, published in ''The Chariton Collector'' magazine Spring, 1987.</ref>\n\n[[Air Choice One]] began scheduled flight operations twice daily, to and from [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]] during July 2009.

Local resident Nick Sparling is credited as being Adair County's first aviator, in 1909. In 1924, Roy B. \"Cap\" Dodson started the first airport in the area, located on the north edge of Kirksville. However, an airfield at the present location of Kirksville Regional Airport wasn't created until 1930 when the Federal Aviation Administration built a series of emergency landing strips across the nation. With America's entry into [[World War II]], the '''Kirksville Municipal Airport''', as it had been declared in the late 1930s, received a major upgrade from the Civilian Pilots Training Program and the US Army Air Corps War Training Service. In 1942 a paved all-weather landing strip, hangars, a control tower and small restaurant were built; the paved runway was 3870&nbsp;ft until 1968.\n\nThe post-war boom in commercial aviation reached Kirksville in 1960 when [[Ozark Airlines]] began scheduled flights. The plane was a familiar sight to many World War II veterans, as Ozark used the Douglas DC-3, the civil counterpart of the famed C-47 'Gooney Bird', now in Ozark's white and evergreen instead of Army Air Corps colors. The Ozark route began in Kansas City to Chicago with stops in Kirksville, [[Ottumwa]] and [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], [[Moline, Illinois]]. Airport improvements came after a bond issue was approved by Kirksville voters in 1967. A new six-thousand foot concrete runway was built, as well as a new terminal building and improved hangar facilities. The longer runway was needed for the faster Fairchild prop-jet that began flights to Kirksville in late 1968. Also in the 1960s, Ozark switched Kirksville service from a Kansas City-Chicago route to a Des Moines-to-St. Louis one. With the airport improvements came a new name, '''Clarence Cannon Memorial Airport'''\u2014chosen to honor long-time US Congressman Clarence Cannon of Missouri who had done much to help secure air service and funding for the airport.\n\nDespite nearly a million dollars in facility upgrades and a steady flow of passengers in and out of Kirksville, Ozark Airlines found the route to be financially untenable by the mid-1970s, with their final departure coming on April 23, 1976. Fortunately a local pilot and dentist, Dr. Stephen Barber, has established a small commuter air service, [[Horizon Airways]], in 1972. Horizon was able to help fill the void left by Ozarks departure, eventually expanding to five aircraft and service to both Kansas City and St. Louis.<ref>''A History Of Adair County Missouri'' published by the Kirksville-Adair County Bicentennial Committee, 1976.</ref><ref>'Flying High!' by Tony Frost & Corey Pritchard, published in ''The Chariton Collector'' magazine Spring, 1987.</ref>\n\n[[Air Choice One]] began scheduled flight operations twice daily, to and from [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]] during July 2009.

The team ran [[Formula Opel Lotus]] cars for [[Peter Milavec]] and [[Christoph Hingartner]] finishing first and second in the championship standings.\n\nThe team made its professional racing debut in the [[2002 World Series by Nissan]] season. Argentine racer [[Nicol\u00e1s Filiberti]] scored the best results for the team. Filiberti's best result was a fourth place at [[Circuito del Jarama]] and ended twelfth in the series championship. Receiving sponsorship from Austrian asset management firm [[Superfund Group]] the team returned in the series for 2003. The team scored mixed results with one podium finish for [[Norbert Siedler]]. Siedler finished fifteenth in the series standings as the best Zele Racing driver. [[Christiano Rocha]] scored podium finishes in the [[Euro Formula 3000]] series, the later Auto GP, in 2004.\n\nZele Racing was in charge developing the stillborn [[Formula Superfund]] series. The series was intended to start for the 2005 season racing the Force 10 SF01 car replacing the Italian Formula 3000 championship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Formula Superfund presents the SF01.|url=http://www.crash.net/gp2/news/66198/1/formula-superfund-presents-the-sf01.html|website=Crash.net|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref> [[Patrick Lemari\u00e9]] tested the car at [[Aut\u00f3dromo Fernanda Pires da Silva|Estoril]].

In 2010 the team won the final season of the original EuroBOSS series. The team's drivers [[Damien Charveriat]] and [[Andreas Zuber]] each won two races of the season that was canceled after four races. The drivers ran [[Dallara]] GP2/05 chassis, previously used in the [[GP2 Series]] until 2008.\n\n===Motopark Academy===\n{{see also|Motopark Academy}}\n\nZele Racing and Motopark Academy entered a partnership for the [[2008 Formula Renault 2.0 Northern European Cup]] and the [[2008 Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0]]. Michael Zele supported Motopark Academy with race engineering services. In the Northern European Cup Motopark Academy drivers [[Valtteri Bottas]] and [[Ant\u00f3nio F\u00e9lix da Costa]] finished first and second in the championship standings. The Eurocup drivers were less successful.\n\n===Epsilon Euskadi===\n{{see also|Barazi-Epsilon}}\n\nMichael Zele was the race engineer for [[St\u00e9phane Richelmi]] in the [[2009 British Formula Three Championship]] racing with [[Barazi-Epsilon]]. Richelmis best result were two twelfth-place finishes. Zele also supported the team at the [[2009 1000 km of Spa]], the second round of the [[2009 Le Mans Series]]. The team finished the race fourth in the LMP2 class with their [[Zytek]] 07S/2.

The 2015 season opener fielded only eight cars, three of which entered by Zele Racing. With only seven cars at the second round of the championship, the remainder of the season was canceled. [[Ant\u00f4nio Pizzonia]] had the best results and was unofficially crowned champion. The series was revived for 2016, but again with very small grids.

The team has raced in the [[Auto GP]] series claiming the series final championship in 2015.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe team was founded by father and son duo Hermann and Michael Zele to compete in the regional [[Interserie]]. The team ran [[Formula Opel Lotus]] cars for [[Peter Milavec]] and [[Christoph Hingartner]] finishing first and second in the championship standings.\n\nThe team made its professional racing debut in the [[2002 World Series by Nissan]] season. Argentine racer [[Nicol\u00e1s Filiberti]] scored the best results for the team. Filiberti's best result was a fourth place at [[Circuito del Jarama]] and ended twelfth in the series championship. Receiving sponsorship from Austrian asset management firm [[Superfund Group]] the team returned in the series for 2003. The team scored mixed results with one podium finish for [[Norbert Siedler]]. Siedler finished fifteenth in the series standings as the best Zele Racing driver. [[Christiano Rocha]] scored podium finishes in the [[Euro Formula 3000]] series, the later Auto GP, in 2004.\n\nZele Racing was in charge developing the stillborn [[Formula Superfund]] series. The series was intended to start for the 2005 season racing the Force 10 SF01 car replacing the Italian Formula 3000 championship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Formula Superfund presents the SF01.|url=http://www.crash.net/gp2/news/66198/1/formula-superfund-presents-the-sf01.html|website=Crash.net|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref> [[Patrick Lemari\u00e9]] tested the car at [[Aut\u00f3dromo Fernanda Pires da Silva|Estoril]]. Lemari\u00e9 had a heavy crash and the series was therefor suspended indefinitely.<ref>{{cite web|title=F3000: Start Formula Superfund uitgesteld|url=http://autosport.nl/klasse/nieuws/7818/start-formula-superfund-uitgesteld|website=Autosport.nl|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2007 and 2012 the team focused on the Interserie, [[EuroBOSS]] and [[BOSS GP]] series. In 2010 the team won the final season of the original EuroBOSS series. The team's drivers [[Damien Charveriat]] and [[Andreas Zuber]] each won two races of the season that was canceled after four races. The drivers ran [[Dallara]] GP2/05 chassis, previously used in the [[GP2 Series]] until 2008.\n\n===Motopark Academy===\n{{see also|Motopark Academy}}\n\nZele Racing and Motopark Academy entered a partnership for the [[2008 Formula Renault 2.0 Northern European Cup]] and the [[2008 Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0]]. Michael Zele supported Motopark Academy with race engineering services. In the Northern European Cup Motopark Academy drivers [[Valtteri Bottas]] and [[Ant\u00f3nio F\u00e9lix da Costa]] finished first and second in the championship standings. The Eurocup drivers were less successful.\n\n===Epsilon Euskadi===\n{{see also|Barazi-Epsilon}}\n\nMichael Zele was the race engineer for [[St\u00e9phane Richelmi]] in the [[2009 British Formula Three Championship]] racing with [[Barazi-Epsilon]]. Richelmis best result were two twelfth-place finishes. Zele also supported the team at the [[2009 1000 km of Spa]], the second round of the [[2009 Le Mans Series]]. The team finished the race fourth in the LMP2 class with their [[Zytek]] 07S/2. However the car did not comply with technical regulations and was disqualified.<ref>{{cite web|title=OAK Racing promoted to the podium after Spa disqualifications.|url=http://www.scapa.com/files/Newsletter_Spa_13_5_2009_UK.pdf|website=Scapa|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Auto GP===\nThe Austrian racing team returned to the professional racing circuit in 2012 entering the [[Auto GP]] series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zele Racing targets Auto GP commitment Auto GP keeps attracting more and more interest as Austrian Team Zele-Racing is ready|url=http://www.automobilsport.com/autogp-zele-racing-auto-gp-commitment-austrian-team---95616.html|website=Automobilsport|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref> During their inaugural, 2012, season the team entered seven different drivers over their two cars. [[Giacomo Ricci]] and [[Sergio Campana (racing driver)|Sergio Campana]] scored the best results for the team, both with a third-place finish. Ricci scored the podium finish at [[Circuit International Automobile Moulay El Hassan|Marrakech]] while Campana scored his podium finish at [[Sonoma Raceway|Sonoma]].\n\nIn 2013 the team started the season with reigning [[FIA Formula Two]] champion [[Luciano Bacheta]] and former [[Formula 1]] driver [[Narain Karthikeyan]]. Bacheta delivered the first race win, at Marrakech. Karthikeyan left the team after the Hungarian round. Karthikeyan felt frustrated with mistakes by the team during pitstops and technical preparation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Narain Karthikeyan leaves Zele Auto GP team|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/107629|website=Autosport.com|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref> Bacheta left the team after four rounds to focus on a possible GP2 Series move.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zele Racing and Luciano Bacheta part|url=https://twitter.com/lucianobacheta/status/342281642804641792|website=Zele Racing|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref> [[Christian Klien]] replaced Bacheta for Mugello, along with [[Tam\u00e1s P\u00e1l Kiss]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Christian Klien returns to open-wheel racing|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2013/07/12/christian-klien-returns-to-open-wheel-racing/|website=Speedcafe|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref> The team did not race until the final round at Brno.\n\nTam\u00e1s P\u00e1l Kiss remained for the majority of the 2014 season, winning at Paul Ricard. At Imola Kiss came in for a pit stop without the team knowing, this cost the Hungarian valuable points.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unlucky weekend for Zele Racing|url=http://www.zele-racing.com/?p=1218|website=Zele Racing|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref> After the difficult Imola weekend Kiss did not return with the team.

This continued for the 2015 Auto GP season. At the start of the season the two championships had the intention to merge, but this did not come to fruition. The 2015 season opener fielded only eight cars, three of which entered by Zele Racing. With only seven cars at the second round of the championship, the remainder of the season was canceled. [[Ant\u00f4nio Pizzonia]] had the best results and was unofficially crowned champion. The series was revived for 2016, but again with very small grids. After the first round of the season the championship merged with [[BOSS GP]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dorrbecker the best driver with Auto GP car in the Boss GP Championship at Assen|url=http://www.autogp.net/newssingola2_en.asp?c=261|website=Auto GP|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Motorsports results==\n\n===Complete World Series by Nissan results===\n([[:Template:Motorsport driver results legend|key]]) (Races in '''bold''' indicate pole position) (Races in ''italics'' indicate fastest lap)\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n!

According to the numbers published by Israel Railways for 2017, 154,977 passengers used the station compared to 221,636 in the [[Beit She'an railway station]] and 346,536  in the [[Afula railway station]].\n\n== Public transportation connections ==\nNear the station there is a bus terminal.

The developers of Pacific Mall claimed they were the first mall in North America to use this business model,{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|pp=115}} though Pacific Mall was preceded by the condominium mall Chinatown Centre in [[Chinatown, Toronto#West Chinatown|West Chinatown, Toronto]], which opened in 1989.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=138}}\n\nThe mall's construction was opposed by some long-term residents of Markham,{{sfn|Chan|2013|pp=120}} and was delayed numerous times from 1993 to 1996.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=141}} Concerns were raised by [[Markham City Council]] over the impact the mall would have parking and traffic volume, the style of the building that would replace Cullen Country Barns, and challenges in dealing with multiple owners in a condo-style mall.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=143}}{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|pp=118}} The Council commissioned an independent study on retail condominiums by John Winter and Associates, which concluded that retail condos are a positive means of diversifying developments.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=144}} Pacific Mall's application underwent a nine-month review,{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=145}} with a building permit granted in May 1995.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=144}}\n\nHistorian Erica Allen-Kim argues that Pacific Mall was \"a weathervane for Markham's ongoing transformation from a rural township to an [[ethnoburb]].\"{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=133}} Then-deputy mayor of Markham Carole Bell received criticism for her statement that \"everything's going Chinese\" in response to the proliferation of ethnic malls.<ref name=\"GM1\">{{cite web |last1=Wong |first1=Jan |title=Not made in China |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/not-made-in-china/article746929/ |website=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=22 October 2019 |date=6 November 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Matt |title=Ethnic Relations I: The Evolution of Steeles and Kennedy |url=http://green.hyperdot.net/ethnic-relations-i-the-evolution-of-steeles-and-kennedy |website=Green Beam City |accessdate=22 October 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522023252/http://green.hyperdot.net/ethnic-relations-i-the-evolution-of-steeles-and-kennedy |archivedate=22 May 2010 |date=5 July 2010}}</ref> She attempted to implement by-laws that would have forbid the rezoning of industrial areas for retail condominiums and made English-language signs mandatory on all structures.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=133}} Then-mayor of Markham [[Don Cousens]] formed an advisory council of eleven Markham residents and three members of council to \"address associated multicultural issues affecting planning decisions.\"{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=144}}\n\n===Opening and continued operation===\n[[File:PacificHeritageTown2.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Emperor's chair at Heritage Town in Pacific Mall.]]\nSources alternately report Pacific Mall as opening in 1996 and in 1997.<ref name=\"1996 Opening\"/><ref name=\"1997 Opening\"/> Its Cantonese name, \"\u592a\u53e4\u5ee3\u5834\" (Tai Gu Gwong Cheung), is derived from [[Pacific Place (Hong Kong)|Pacific Place]] in [[Hong Kong]]. At the time of its opening, Pacific Mall was the only mall of any kind of its scale in Scarborough and Markham.{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|pp=117}} The mall's 715 retail condos were presold by 1993 for an average of $200 per square foot, with condos priced from $59,800 to $249,800.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=145}} A majority of condo buyers originated from Hong Kong, where Pacific Mall units were advertised extensively;{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=145}} many investors purchased units in Pacific Mall in order to fulfill the $250,000 investment requirement of CANIIP.{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|pp=115}}\n\nAfter business at the mall was initially slow, half of the unused second floor (which is owned and operated by Torgan Group, rather than condo leasees{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=146}}) was renovated in 1999 into Heritage Town, a Pacific-style market that contains approximately 100 vendors.{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|pp=117}} Aimed at attracting tourists and non-Chinese customers,{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|pp=146}} Torgan Group commissioned artists and sculptors in China to make custom decorations for Heritage Town, including a large [[bas-relief]] of a dragon, 300 lanterns, an emperor's chair, a wood-work bridge, and [[terracotta soldiers]].{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|pp=117}} Heritage Town was successful in attracting additional business, prompting the mall to seek and be awarded designation as a Canadian Tourist Attraction.
