The album reached No. 10 in the US, and reached No. 2 in the UK. The album features five singles, among them a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Robbie Robertson]]'s song \"[[Broken Arrow (Robbie Robertson song)|Broken Arrow]]\" (No. 20 in the US) and [[Van Morrison]]'s song \"[[Have I Told You Lately]]\", which would become a hit two years later (in a live version) and is Stewart's most recent top five solo hit in the US and the UK. The two biggest hits from the album were \"[[Rhythm of My Heart]]\" (No. 5 in the US) and \"[[The Motown Song]]\" (No. 10 in the US).\n\n==Reception==\nOverall, the album received positive reviews. According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', \"''Vagabond Heart'' finds Stewart rising to new challenges as both a songwriter and a singer. The strength of the songs and the depth of Stewart's conviction make this his most compelling work since the early 1970s.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/vagabond-heart-251867/|title=Vagabond Heart|first1=Don|last1=McLeese|first2=Don|last2=McLeese|date=16 May 1991|publisher=}}</ref>\n[[AllMusic]] claimed \"''Vagabond Heart'' is a stronger, more diverse album than its predecessor (''[[Out of Order (Rod Stewart album)|Out of Order]]''), featuring a more consistent set of songs.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/vagabond-heart-mw0000691766|title=Vagabond Heart - Rod Stewart - Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/vagabond-heart-rod-stewart/73412?ean=0075992630023|title=Vagabond Heart|first=Barnes &|last=Noble|website=Barnes & Noble}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Vagabond Heart Tour\" was made available on video in 1992, shot during a concert in [[Los Angeles]] on [[Valentine's Day]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies|title=Showtimes, reviews, trailers, news and more - MSN Movies|website=MSN}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n\n| title1       = [[Rhythm of My Heart]]\n| writer1      = [[Marc Jordan]], [[John Capek]]\n| extra1       = [[Trevor Horn]]\n| length1      = 4:15\n\n| title2       = Rebel Heart\n| writer2      = Stewart, [[Jeff Golub]], Chuck Kentis, Carmine Rojas\n| extra2       = Rod Stewart, [[Bernard Edwards]]\n| length2      = 4:10\n\n| title3       = Broken Arrow\n| writer3      = [[Robbie Robertson]]\n| extra3       = [[Patrick Leonard]], [[Lenny Waronker]]{{ref|a|[a]}}\n| length3      = 4:26\n\n| title4       = [[It Takes Two (Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston song)|It Takes Two]]\n| note4        = duet with [[Tina Turner]]\n| writer4      = [[William \"Mickey\" Stevenson]], [[Sylvia Moy]]\n| extra4       = Stewart, Edwards\n| length4      = 4:14\n\n| title5       = When a Man's in Love\n| writer5      = Stewart, Jeff Golub, Chuck Kentis, Carmine Rojas\n| extra5       = Stewart, Edwards\n| length5      = 5:34\n\n| title6       = [[You Are Everything]]\n| writer6      = [[Thom Bell]], [[Linda Creed]]\n| extra6       = Stewart, Edwards\n| length6      = 4:09\n\n| title7       = [[The Motown Song]]\n| writer7      = Larry John McNally\n| extra7       = [[Richard Perry]]\n| length7      = 4:00\n\n| title8       = Go Out Dancing\n| writer8      = Stewart, Jeff Golub, Chuck Kentis\n| extra8       = Stewart, Edwards\n| length8      = 4:20\n\n| title9       = No Holding Back\n| writer9      = Stewart, [[Jim Cregan]], Kevin Savigar\n| extra9       = Stewart, Edwards\n| length9      = 5:47\n\n| title10      = [[Have I Told You Lately]]\n| writer10     = [[Van Morrison]]\n| extra10      = Stewart, Edwards\n| length10     = 4:01\n\n| title11      = Moment of Glory\n| writer11     = Stewart, Jeff Golub, Chuck Kentis, Carmine Rojas\n| extra11      = Stewart, Edwards\n| length11     = 4:47\n\n| title12      = [[Downtown Train]]\n| writer12     = [[Tom Waits]]\n| extra12      = [[Trevor Horn]]\n| length12     = 4:41\n\n| title13      = [[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak For You)]]\n| writer13     = [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]], [[Sylvia Moy]]\n| extra13      = Edwards, Horn\n| length13     = 4:12\n\n| title14      = If Only\n| writer14     = Stewart, Jim Cregan, Kevin Savigar\n| extra14      = Stewart, Edwards\n| length14     = 4:56\n}}\n\n'''Notes'''\n* {{small|{{note|a|a}}}} signifies a co-producer\n*\"Downtown Train\" and \"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak For You) are omitted on cassette copies, as well as some CD versions.\n\n==Personnel==\n(Personnel for the 12-track version of the album, excluding the tracks \"Downtown Train\" and \"This Old Heart of Mine\")\n* \"Rebel Heart\", \"It Takes Two\", \"When a Man's in Love\", \"You are Everything\", \"Go Out Dancing\", \"No Holding Back\", \"Have I Told You Lately\", \"Moment of Glory\" and \"If Only\" arranged and produced by Rod Stewart and [[Bernard Edwards]].

The album reached No. 10 in the US, and reached No. 2 in the UK. The album features five singles, among them a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Robbie Robertson]]'s song \"[[Broken Arrow (Robbie Robertson song)|Broken Arrow]]\" (No. 20 in the US) and [[Van Morrison]]'s song \"[[Have I Told You Lately]]\", which would become a hit two years later (in a live version) and is Stewart's most recent top five solo hit in the US and the UK. The two biggest hits from the album were \"[[Rhythm of My Heart]]\" (No. 5 in the US) and \"[[The Motown Song]]\" (No. 10 in the US).\n\n==Reception==\nOverall, the album received positive reviews. According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', \"''Vagabond Heart'' finds Stewart rising to new challenges as both a songwriter and a singer. The strength of the songs and the depth of Stewart's conviction make this his most compelling work since the early 1970s.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/vagabond-heart-251867/|title=Vagabond Heart|first1=Don|last1=McLeese|first2=Don|last2=McLeese|date=16 May 1991|publisher=}}</ref>\n[[AllMusic]] claimed \"''Vagabond Heart'' is a stronger, more diverse album than its predecessor (''[[Out of Order (Rod Stewart album)|Out of Order]]''), featuring a more consistent set of songs.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/vagabond-heart-mw0000691766|title=Vagabond Heart - Rod Stewart - Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/vagabond-heart-rod-stewart/73412?ean=0075992630023|title=Vagabond Heart|first=Barnes &|last=Noble|website=Barnes & Noble}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Vagabond Heart Tour\" was made available on video in 1992, shot during a concert in [[Los Angeles]] on [[Valentine's Day]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies|title=Showtimes, reviews, trailers, news and more - MSN Movies|website=MSN}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n\n| title1       = [[Rhythm of My Heart]]\n| writer1      = [[Marc Jordan]], [[John Capek]]\n| extra1       = [[Trevor Horn]]\n| length1      = 4:15\n\n| title2       = Rebel Heart\n| writer2      = Stewart, [[Jeff Golub]], Chuck Kentis, Carmine Rojas\n| extra2       = Rod Stewart, [[Bernard Edwards]]\n| length2      = 4:10\n\n| title3       = Broken Arrow\n| writer3      = [[Robbie Robertson]]\n| extra3       = [[Patrick Leonard]], [[Lenny Waronker]]{{ref|a|[a]}}\n| length3      = 4:26\n\n| title4       = [[It Takes Two (Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston song)|It Takes Two]]\n| writer4      = duet with [[Tina Turner]]) ([[William \"Mickey\" Stevenson]], [[Sylvia Moy]]\n| extra4       = Stewart, Edwards\n| length4      = 4:14\n\n| title5       = When a Man's in Love\n| writer5      = Stewart, Jeff Golub, Chuck Kentis, Carmine Rojas\n| extra5       = Stewart, Edwards\n| length5      = 5:34\n\n| title6       = [[You Are Everything]]\n| writer6      = [[Thom Bell]], [[Linda Creed]]\n| extra6       = Stewart, Edwards\n| length6      = 4:09\n\n| title7       = [[The Motown Song]]\n| writer7      = Larry John McNally\n| extra7       = [[Richard Perry]]\n| length7      = 4:00\n\n| title8       = Go Out Dancing\n| writer8      = Stewart, Jeff Golub, Chuck Kentis\n| extra8       = Stewart, Edwards\n| length8      = 4:20\n\n| title9       = No Holding Back\n| writer9      = Stewart, [[Jim Cregan]], Kevin Savigar\n| extra9       = Stewart, Edwards\n| length9      = 5:47\n\n| title10      = [[Have I Told You Lately]]\n| writer10     = [[Van Morrison]]\n| extra10      = Stewart, Edwards\n| length10     = 4:01\n\n| title11      = Moment of Glory\n| writer11     = Stewart, Jeff Golub, Chuck Kentis, Carmine Rojas\n| extra11      = Stewart, Edwards\n| length11     = 4:47\n\n| title12      = [[Downtown Train]]\n| writer12     = [[Tom Waits]]\n| extra12      = [[Trevor Horn]]\n| length12     = 4:41\n\n| title13      = [[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak For You)]]\n| writer13     = [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]], [[Sylvia Moy]]\n| extra13      = Edwards, Horn\n| length13     = 4:12\n\n| title14      = If Only\n| writer14     = Stewart, Jim Cregan, Kevin Savigar\n| extra14      = Stewart, Edwards\n| length14     = 4:56\n}}\n\n'''Notes'''\n* {{small|{{note|a|a}}}} signifies a co-producer\n*\"Downtown Train\" and \"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak For You) are omitted on cassette copies, as well as some CD versions.\n\n==Personnel==\n(Personnel for the 12-track version of the album, excluding the tracks \"Downtown Train\" and \"This Old Heart of Mine\")\n* \"Rebel Heart\", \"It Takes Two\", \"When a Man's in Love\", \"You are Everything\", \"Go Out Dancing\", \"No Holding Back\", \"Have I Told You Lately\", \"Moment of Glory\" and \"If Only\" arranged and produced by Rod Stewart and [[Bernard Edwards]].

He is the most decorated Freestyle Motocross rider in [[X Games]] history. With 10 total medals (3 Golds and 7 Bronzes), he is the only rider to compete in at least 1 event in every X Games. He became a born again Christian after a near fatal crash in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Higgins|first1=Matt|title=Some X Games Bad Boys Turn to the Bible|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/sports/02xgames.html|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=1 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Racing career==\n[[File:Brian Deegan jumping at X Games 17 in Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|[[X Games]] 17 in Los Angeles]]\nDeegan was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].  He became a pro supercross rider with Team Moto XXX at age 17. In 1997 at the LA Coliseum, Brian Deegan won the 125cc main and in true rebel fashion, ghost rode his bike across the finish line. This was the beginning of what we know today as Freestyle Motocross.\n\nIn 2004, at the Winter X Games, Deegan crashed while attempting a 360 over a 100&nbsp;ft snow double, breaking his [[femur]] and both wrists. He came back 6 months later to place fourth at the Summer X Games. Deegan was also the first rider ever to land a 360 (Mulisha Twist) in competition.\n\nSwitching to [[off-road racing|four wheels]] in 2009, Deegan ventured into short course off-road racing in the [[Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series]]' Unlimited Lites division, winning the championship over experienced drivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racerxonline.com/article/brian-deegan-wins-off-road-championship.aspx|title=Brian Deegan Wins Off-Road Championship|date=November 16, 2009|publisher=Racer X Online|accessdate=2 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120050819/http://www.racerxonline.com/article/brian-deegan-wins-off-road-championship.aspx|archive-date=20 November 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAt the 2010 X Games, Deegan competed in the Rally Car Racing event at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Deegan finished second behind Tanner Foust due to a wrong turn he made during the race. Brian also competed in Rally Car Super Rally where he also finished second behind Tanner Foust.\n\nAt X Games XVII, Deegan won gold in RallyCross.\n\nIn 2011, he won the World Championship race at [[Crandon International Off-Road Raceway]] in the [[Traxxas TORC Series]]. He also competed at the [[2011 Race of Champions|Race of Champions]]. He also won the championships in the Pro Lite Unlimited and Pro 2 classes of the Lucas oil Off Road Racing Series.\n\nIn 2012, he debuted the Metal Mulisha [[Monster truck]]. Todd LeDuc officially debuted it at [[Reliant Stadium]] in [[Houston, Texas]] in January 2012. Deegan himself drove the truck in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] at [[Chase Field]]. He was scheduled to drive the truck at the Monster Jam World Finals 13, but injured himself in driving practice. Todd LeDuc replaced him. He also won his second championship in the Pro 2 class of the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series.\n\nDeegan raced an [[OlsbergsMSE]] [[Ford Fiesta]] at the [[Global RallyCross Championship]], resulting runner-up in 2012, fourth in 2013 and 12th in 2014. He also continued his Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series career, winning the Pro Light Unlimited championship in 2013 and the Pro 2 championship in 2014. In 2015, Deegan was hired by [[Chip Ganassi Racing]] to compete in seven Global Rallycross Championship races in an [[M-Sport]] Fiesta along with former professional motocross rider [[Jeff Ward (motorsports)|Jeff Ward]].<ref>{{cite web|last=McFadin|first=Daniel|url=http://nascartalk.nbcsports.com/2015/03/18/chip-ganassi-red-bull-global-rallycross-xgames/|title=Chip Ganassi Racing enters world of Global Rallycross|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=March 18, 2015|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Media appearances==\nDuring a 2005 taping of [[MTV]]'s [[Viva La Bam]] Deegan under-rotated a back-flip and the handle bars hit hard in his midsection, almost losing his life. He lost a [[kidney]], lacerated his [[spleen]], and lost a significant amount of blood. He now has a long scar down his stomach, that he calls his \"zipper\", spanning almost his entire abdomen, as a result of the accident. At the end of the episode when it originally aired, Bam dedicated it to Brian. The accident was cut out of the show.\n\nAlso during taping of the same show, [[Bam Margera]]'s uncle, [[Vincent Margera|Don Vito]], was forced by his nephew to lay down on the ground with the intention of Deegan and two others to jump over him, for what Margera and Deegan called the \"Fatboy Jump World Record\". Vito was held by the feet and arms by Margera and [[Raab Himself]] in order to restrain him. The bikers jumped over Vito, with Deegan narrowly missing him by less than a foot away, which startled Vito. That bit was featured in the show.\n\nIn 2006, Deegan and Berkela films released a film entitled ''Disposable Hero'' that follows him through the struggles and rewards that accompany the freestyle motocross sport and lifestyle. Jesse James, Ronnie Faist, [[Jeremy Stenberg]], Cameron Steele, Chris Ackerman, [[Nate Adams]], and Seth Enslow are a few of the featured cast that talk about Deegan and his life's journeys. The film aired on [[Spike TV]] on December 5, 2007.\n\nDeegan performed stunts in the movie ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]''. He is also working on a reality show for [[MTV]]. There is no scheduled air date yet.\n\nHe has been on the cover of ''[[Transworld MX]]'' and ''[[Racer X (magazine)|Racer X]]'' magazines and has been featured  multiple times in ''[[FHM]]'' magazine.\n\nDeegan was in the [[Game Boy Advance]]/[[Nintendo GameCube]]/[[PlayStation 2]] video game ''[[Freekstyle]]''.\n\n==Other ventures==\nIn addition to supporting riders, the Metal Mulisha have a clothing line and other related merchandise. Deegan also has a toy line called Hevy Hitters distributed in retail locations such as [[Walmart]]. Most recently he teamed up with Illektron to create Battlez FMX, a collectible card and dice game featuring Deegan, Todd Potter and [[Jeremy Lusk]].\n\nHe is the former owner of the FMX park, the Compound, which he later sold to [[Nate Adams]]. At the 2007 X Games Deegan stated he sometimes regrets selling it. He also owns Supercross.\n\n==Personal life==\nBrian Deegan has been married to Marissa Deegan since 2003. Together, they have three children. [[Hailie Deegan]], who currently competes full-time in the ARCA Menards Series, Haiden and Hudson who competes in youth Motocross. Bloodline: The Life and Times of Brian Deegan is Brian documentary about his transition from being a championship motocross rider to a father of next generation motorsports stars.\n\n==Career highlights==\n*1997 Los Angeles Supercross \u2013 1st place\n*1999 World Freestyle champ / Gravity Games Silver\n*2000 Gravity Games Gold\n*2000 Air MX Champ\n*2000 Bluetorch Ride and Slide FMX Champ\n*2001 Moto x Big Air \u2013 Bronze\n*2002 Winter X Games Gold\n*2003 Featured Rider on Tony Hawk tour\n*2003 Summer X-Games Gold\n*2003 EXPN Rider of the year nominee\n*First to land a 360\n*2004 ESPY award nominee\n*Hold the most medals in FMX X Games history: 10 medals\n*2004 ESPN top 100 athlete of all sports\n*2005 Winter X Games Gold Medalist\n*2007 Winner Best Biography X Dance Action Sports Film Festival for Brian Deegan: Disposable Hero\n*2009 Awarded The Lifetime Achievement Award At The Transworld Motocross Awards In Las Vegas.\n*1 gold and 5 medals at the X Games rally events.\n*2nd at the 2012 Global RallyCross Championship.\n*4th at the 2013 Global RallyCross Championship.\n*2009, 2011 and 2013 [[Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series]] Pro Lite Unlimited champion\n*2011, 2012 and 2014 Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series Pro 2 Unlimited champion\n*2011 World Championship race winner in the Pro Light truck class\n\n==Racing record==\n===Complete Global RallyCross Championship results===\n====Supercar====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!

He is the most decorated Freestyle Motocross rider in [[X Games]] history. With 10 total medals (3 Golds and 7 Bronzes), he is the only rider to compete in at least 1 event in every X Games. He became a born again Christian after a near fatal crash in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Higgins|first1=Matt|title=Some X Games Bad Boys Turn to the Bible|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/sports/02xgames.html|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=1 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Racing career==\n[[File:Brian Deegan jumping at X Games 17 in Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|[[X Games]] 17 in Los Angeles]]\nDeegan was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].  He became a pro supercross rider with Team Moto XXX at age 17. In 1997 at the LA Coliseum, Brian Deegan won the 125cc main and in true rebel fashion, ghost rode his bike across the finish line. This was the beginning of what we know today as Freestyle Motocross.\n\nIn 2004, at the Winter X Games, Deegan crashed while attempting a 360 over a 100&nbsp;ft snow double, breaking his [[femur]] and both wrists. He came back 6 months later to place fourth at the Summer X Games. Deegan was also the first rider ever to land a 360 (Mulisha Twist) in competition.\n\nSwitching to [[off-road racing|four wheels]] in 2009, Deegan ventured into short course off-road racing in the [[Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series]]' Unlimited Lites division, winning the championship over experienced drivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racerxonline.com/article/brian-deegan-wins-off-road-championship.aspx|title=Brian Deegan Wins Off-Road Championship|date=November 16, 2009|publisher=Racer X Online|accessdate=2 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120050819/http://www.racerxonline.com/article/brian-deegan-wins-off-road-championship.aspx|archive-date=20 November 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAt the 2010 X Games, Deegan competed in the Rally Car Racing event at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Deegan finished second behind Tanner Foust due to a wrong turn he made during the race. Brian also competed in Rally Car Super Rally where he also finished second behind Tanner Foust.\n\nAt X Games XVII, Deegan won gold in RallyCross.\n\nIn 2011, he won the World Championship race at [[Crandon International Off-Road Raceway]] in the [[Traxxas TORC Series]]. He also competed at the [[2011 Race of Champions|Race of Champions]]. He also won the championships in the Pro Lite Unlimited and Pro 2 classes of the Lucas oil Off Road Racing Series.\n\nIn 2012, he debuted the Metal Mulisha [[Monster truck]]. Todd LeDuc officially debuted it at [[Reliant Stadium]] in [[Houston, Texas]] in January 2012. Deegan himself drove the truck in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] at [[Chase Field]]. He was scheduled to drive the truck at the Monster Jam World Finals 13, but injured himself in driving practice. Todd LeDuc replaced him. He also won his second championship in the Pro 2 class of the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series.\n\nDeegan raced an [[OlsbergsMSE]] [[Ford Fiesta]] at the [[Global RallyCross Championship]], resulting runner-up in 2012, fourth in 2013 and 12th in 2014. He also continued his Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series career, winning the Pro Light Unlimited championship in 2013 and the Pro 2 championship in 2014. In 2015, Deegan was hired by [[Chip Ganassi Racing]] to compete in seven Global Rallycross Championship races in an [[M-Sport]] Fiesta along with former professional motocross rider [[Jeff Ward (motorsports)|Jeff Ward]].<ref>{{cite web|last=McFadin|first=Daniel|url=http://nascartalk.nbcsports.com/2015/03/18/chip-ganassi-red-bull-global-rallycross-xgames/|title=Chip Ganassi Racing enters world of Global Rallycross|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=March 18, 2015|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Media appearances==\nDuring a 2005 taping of [[MTV]]'s [[Viva La Bam]] Deegan under-rotated a back-flip and the handle bars hit hard in his midsection, almost losing his life. He lost a [[kidney]], lacerated his [[spleen]], and lost a significant amount of blood. He now has a long scar down his stomach, that he calls his \"zipper\", spanning almost his entire abdomen, as a result of the accident. At the end of the episode when it originally aired, Bam dedicated it to Brian. The accident was cut out of the show.\n\nAlso during taping of the same show, [[Bam Margera]]'s uncle, [[Vincent Margera|Don Vito]], was forced by his nephew to lay down on the ground with the intention of Deegan and two others to jump over him, for what Margera and Deegan called the \"Fatboy Jump World Record\". Vito was held by the feet and arms by Margera and [[Raab Himself]] in order to restrain him. The bikers jumped over Vito, with Deegan narrowly missing him by less than a foot away, which startled Vito. That bit was featured in the show.\n\nIn 2006, Deegan and Berkela films released a film entitled ''Disposable Hero'' that follows him through the struggles and rewards that accompany the freestyle motocross sport and lifestyle. Jesse James, Ronnie Faist, [[Jeremy Stenberg]], Cameron Steele, Chris Ackerman, [[Nate Adams]], and Seth Enslow are a few of the featured cast that talk about Deegan and his life's journeys. The film aired on [[Spike TV]] on December 5, 2007.\n\nDeegan performed stunts in the movie ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]''. He is also working on a reality show for [[MTV]]. There is no scheduled air date yet.\n\nHe has been on the cover of ''[[Transworld MX]]'' and ''[[Racer X (magazine)|Racer X]]'' magazines and has been featured  multiple times in ''[[FHM]]'' magazine.\n\nDeegan was in the [[Game Boy Advance]]/[[Nintendo GameCube]]/[[PlayStation 2]] video game ''[[Freekstyle]]''.\n\n==Other ventures==\nIn addition to supporting riders, the Metal Mulisha have a clothing line and other related merchandise. Deegan also has a toy line called Hevy Hitters distributed in retail locations such as [[Walmart]]. Most recently he teamed up with Illektron to create Battlez FMX, a collectible card and dice game featuring Deegan, Todd Potter and [[Jeremy Lusk]].\n\nHe is the former owner of the FMX park, the Compound, which he later sold to [[Nate Adams]]. At the 2007 X Games Deegan stated he sometimes regrets selling it. He also owns Supercross.\n\n==Personal life==\nBrian Deegan has been married to Marissa Deegan since 2003. Together, they have three children. [[Hailie Deegan]], who currently competes full-time in the ARCA Menards Series, Haiden and Hudson who competes in youth Motocross. Bloodline: The Life and Times of Brian Deegan is Brian documentary about his transition from being a championship motocross rider to a father of next generation motorsports stars.\n\n==Career highlights==\n*1997 Los Angeles Supercross \u2013 1st place\n*1999 World Freestyle champ / Gravity Games Silver\n*2000 Gravity Games Gold\n*2000 Air MX Champ\n*2000 Bluetorch Ride and Slide FMX Champ\n*2001 Moto x Big Air \u2013 Bronze\n*2002 Winter X Games Gold\n*2003 Featured Rider on Tony Hawk tour\n*2003 Summer X-Games Gold\n*2003 EXPN Rider of the year nominee\n*First to land a 360\n*2004 ESPY award nominee\n*Hold the most medals in FMX X Games history: 10 medals\n*2004 ESPN top 100 athlete of all sports\n*2005 Winter X Games Gold Medalist\n*2007 Winner Best Biography X Dance Action Sports Film Festival for Brian Deegan: Disposable Hero\n*2009 Awarded The Lifetime Achievement Award At The Transworld Motocross Awards In Las Vegas.\n*1 gold and 5 medals at the X Games rally events.\n*2nd at the 2012 Global RallyCross Championship.\n*4th at the 2013 Global RallyCross Championship.\n*2009, 2011 and 2013 [[Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series]] Pro Lite Unlimited champion\n*2011, 2012 and 2014 Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series Pro 2 Unlimited champion\n*2011 World Championship race winner in the Pro Light truck class\n\n==Racing record==\n===Complete Global RallyCross Championship results===\n====Supercar====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!
