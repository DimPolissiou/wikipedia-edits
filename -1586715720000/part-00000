Upon the Albanian delegation's return from Yugoslavia, Pasko was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for his criticism, during which he attempted suicide. Following the freeing of Yugoslavia's hold over Albanian party politics, Pasko was released.\n\nAfter his release from prison, he was informed by the authorities that his family would be banished to [[Kavaj\u00eb]].

(1994, September 4). \"Underground Club a Hit with Medical Pot Users\".  ''Sacramento Bee'', p. A1.</ref> However, cannabis had been illegal in the United States since 1937.  Classified under [[Schedule I controlled substance|Schedule I]] of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] in 1970 as a drug that \"has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States\", medicinal users of cannabis were subject to arrest.<ref name=\"Economist\">\"Mary Jane Rathbun\", 1999, p. 86: \"The change in the Californian law in 1996 came about when voters supported a \"state initiative\" over marijuana. Similar initiatives have since changed the law in several other American states. However, under a federal law, passed in 1937, possession of marijuana remains prohibited, and this law takes precedence over state law. As a result, users of marijuana for medicinal reasons, even where the state law sanctions such use, are not necessarily safe from arrest.\"</ref><ref>[[Institute of Medicine]].

He told Rathbun about ACT UP, and she later spoke to the group about her first-hand experience distributing cannabis-laced brownies to people with AIDS.  Reporter Peter Gorman noted that this time \"the reception was warmer, but still skeptical\".<ref name=\"Gorman\">Gorman, P. (1994, December). \"Marijuana And AIDS\".

Proposition P passed with the support of 79&nbsp;percent of San Francisco voters on November 5, 1991.<ref>Reed 1999; Herscher 1992, p.

She pleaded not guilty to two counts of felony marijuana possession.<ref name=\"Herscher 1992 p A1\"/>  Rathbun was acquitted of the charges.  Attorney Norman Elliott Kent notes that Rathbun's legal defense relied on medical necessity, the same defense used by Robert Randall in ''United States v. Randall'' (1976).  According to Kent, Rathbun \"was able to testify that her deliveries were made to assist others in need, not to advance individual greed, that the nobility of her actions outweighed the reprehensibleness of her offense according to the law.\"<ref>Kent, N.

Outside the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]], Rathbun invited Mason to \"follow me around for two days as I visit my kids in the wards, and then see where he stands on this\".<ref name=\"AW92\"/>\n\nIn 1992, Rathbun helped Peron open the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club, the first medical cannabis dispensary in the United States.<ref>Saxon, 1999; Peron, 1996: \"She beat the rap [1992 arrest] and went on to help me start the Cannabis Buyers Club\".

They were typically mummified for four main purposes\u2014to allow beloved pets to go on to the afterlife, to provide food in the [[afterlife]], to act as offerings to a particular [[ancient Egyptian deities|god]], and because some were seen as physical manifestations of specific deities that the Egyptians worshipped.

The most famous example of this is the [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] Queen [[Makare]]\u2019s adult Green Monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops). When her tomb was discovered, there was a small, mummified bundle present at her feet, which was initially believed to be her child.

Two main types of worship distinguished the cults\u2014the first choosing to worship the god through mass mummified animal offerings and the second selecting a totem animal to represent the god,<ref name=\"Aufderheide\" /> which was mummified at the time of its death.\n\n==== Votive offerings====\nThe vast majority of Egyptian animal mummies were religious offerings.<ref name=\"Brier\" /> If an Egyptian sought a favor from a deity, an offering would be made or purchased, and placed at the appropriate temple of the god.<ref name=\"Velde\"/> Before animal mummification became common, these offerings were usually bronze statues depicting the animals.<ref name=\"Brier\" /> However, eventually a cheaper alternative to bronze statues\u2014animal mummies\u2014became the most popular form of offering. Literally millions of these mummified animals have been discovered throughout Egypt. Inspection of these mummies, usually done through CT scans which allow researchers to examine the skeletons of the mummies without damaging the outer wrappings, has suggested that these types of animals were bred for the sole purpose of offerings. As the process of animal mummification for the purpose of offerings grew, mummification techniques became progressively less meticulous. Studies have revealed many of the large-scale animal offerings to be \u2018fakes\u2019 \u2014 the wrappings containing only a few bones, feathers, reeds, wood, or pieces of pottery. The animals were raised on temple grounds, and then sold to pilgrims or regular citizens. The necks of the animals were often broken, an indication that their sole purpose in life was to be sacrificed as offerings. When visiting the temples, Egyptians of the general public would purchase these pre-mummified animals and offer them to the gods.\n\nThe Egyptian god Hor, living in the second century BCE suggests the purpose underlying the practice of mummifying animals: \"The benefit [of mummification] which is performed for the Ibis, the soul of Toth, the greatest one, is made for the Hawk also, the soul of Ptah, the soul of Apis, the soul of Pre, the soul of Shu, the soul of Tefnut, the soul of Geb, the soul of Osiris, the soul of Isis, the soul of Nephtys, the great gods of Egypt, the Ibis and the Hawk.\" Hor believes that the mummies are the souls of the gods: he describes the ibis as the soul of Toth and the hawk as the soul of many different gods. That is to say, some animals were, or contained, a ''ba''- a part of the soul that is an active agents in this world and the spiritual world. Therefore, votive animal mummies are the animals' souls acted as messengers between people on earth and the gods.<ref>Bleiberg, Edward, '' Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt'', Brooklyn Museum: 2013.</ref>\n\n===== Cats =====\n{{see also|Cats in ancient Egypt#Funerary traditions}}\n[[File:Louvre egyptologie 21.jpg|right|thumb|A [[mummy|mummified]] cat]]\nCats were mummified as religious offerings in enormous quantities and were believed to represent the war goddess [[Bastet]]. This cult was primarily centered at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and [[Beni Hasan]] beginning in the [[Ptolemaic Period]]. In addition, thousands of cat mummies have been found at the catacombs of [[Saqqara]]. Cats who were bred to become offerings of this type usually died due to strangulation or the breaking of their necks. During mummification, the cat bodies would be dried and filled with soil, sand or some other kind of packing material. They were either positioned with their limbs folded closely to their bodies or in a sitting, lifelike position. The wrapping was usually completed through intricate, geometric patterns. Early in the development of animal mummification, cat mummies were placed in little bronze or wooden sarcophagi. More expensive mummies were typically adorned with features drawn in black paint and colored glass, obsidian or rock crystal eyes. Kittens and fetuses were mummified and buried inside the stomach of a statue that represented their mother. As time went by, like all mummies designed for this purpose, the mummification became less precise. In fact, Sir [[T. C. S. Morrison-Scott]], former Director of the [[British Museum of Natural History]], unwrapped a large number of cat mummies, but discovered many were simply stuffed with random body parts of cats and not mummified with detailed care.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===== Ibises =====\n[[File:Ibis Coffin, 305-30 B.C.E., 49.48.jpg|thumb|Ibis Coffin, 305-30 B.C.E., 49.48, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nThe [[ibis]] cult was established primarily during the [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods and was dedicated to the god of wisdom, [[Thoth]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp455-fs14/2014/09/25/animal-mummification/|title=Animal Mummification|date=2014-09-25|work=Archaeology of Ancient Egypt|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}</ref>  Research from 2015 using 14C radiocarbon dating suggests that the Egyptian Ibis mummies in the study were from time frame that falls between approximately 450 and 250 BC.

Saqqara alone is estimated to contain nearly 500,000 of these mummies and is also thought to have produced 10,000 mummified offerings per year. In addition, approximately four million ibis burials have been uncovered at the catacombs of [[Tuna el-Gebel]]. Mummification of the ibis included desiccation and evisceration. Usually, the head and neck of the bird were bent backwards and pressed on the body. The body was then dipped in tar and wrapped tightly with linen. The vast number of mummified ibises suggests that this was done in a mass production, as many times the mummies contained only a part of the body. After serving their ritual purposes, the mummified bodies were placed in ceramic pots, coffins or sarcophagi.\n\n===== Baboons =====\n[[File:Egyptian - Baboon Mummy Coffin - Walters 22245.jpg|thumb|This coffin, shaped like a baboon, once contained the remains of a baboon as an offering to the god [[Thoth]]. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]\nBaboons also represented [[Thoth]], the god of the moon as well as the god of wisdom. The appearance of baboons on [[canopic jar]]s, which housed the organs of human mummies, is testament of the animals\u2019 tremendous cultural significance. Baboons were reared in mass quantities at temples, though the numbers of baboon mummies that have been discovered are not as large as cats or ibises. Around 400 were uncovered at the tombs of Saqqara. Most baboons were mummified with the use of plaster and buried in wooden chests. Baboon mummies that have been discovered have provided significant evidence that they were bred and mummified as offerings. This evidence includes proof that the baboons usually did not die from natural causes, and that the majority suffered from malnutrition, fractures, [[osteomylitis]], and vitamin D deficiency.\n\n===== Crocodiles =====\nThe crocodile was regarded as an extremely fierce animal, often used to terrify enemies during war. The crocodile cult was devoted to [[Sebek]], god of fertility, and the sun god, Re. Typically, crocodiles were raised in a life of complete luxury, indulged until they died. In the early years of this cult, dead crocodiles were lavishly mummified with gold and other precious things. However, as mummification gradually became a production process, less effort was exerted in their mummification and eventually consisted simply of cloth wrappings and the application of resin, a preserving agent. When found in extremely large quantities, crocodile mummies, like many other sorts of animal offerings, contained only reeds or random body parts.\nAt the main temple of Shedet, later called Crocodilopolis, sacred crocodiles were mummified and displayed in temple shrines or carried in processions.<ref>[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg, Edward]], '' Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt'', Brooklyn Museum: 2013.</ref>\n\n===== Fish =====\nFish were mummified in mass quantities as offerings to the god. They were wrapped in linen and held together by bands of cloth soaked in sticky resin, permanently encasing the mummies. Many times, black circles representing the eyes were painted on the hardened linen. Several species of fish have been identified, but due to the deteriorating condition of the mummies, scientists are unable to conclude if the organs were typically removed during the process of mummification. According to the Museum of Liverpool the Nile perch was one of the species mummified and offered to the gods on of these cults is related to The goddess [[Neith]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/wml/collections/antiquities/ancient-egypt/item-391503.aspx|title=Fish Mummy, Ancient Egypt collection|website=www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref>\n\n===== Miscellaneous animals =====\n[[File:Dog Mummy, 305 B.C.E.-395 C.E.,05.308.jpg|thumbnail|Dog Mummy, 305 B.C.E.-395 C.E.,05.308, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nAdditional animals mummified and the corresponding god they represented:<ref name=\"Cairo\" />\n*Mongoose/Shrew ([[Horus]])\n**A large type of mongoose common in Africa, the ichneumon (''Herpestes ichneumon'') is represented in Egyptian art from the Old Kingdom onward. Revered for its ability to kill snakes, the ichneumon was related to Horus and Atum, among others and worshipped throughout the country. The shrew, a mouse size nocturnal mammal, substituted for ichneumons in Egyptian myth. Believed to have vision in both light and darkness, the god Horus Khenty-irty of Letopolis was represented by the wide eyed type of ichneumon and the shrew respectively. Shrews appear as the focus of worship particularly in the Late Period.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt|date=2013|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|pages=46\u201349}}</ref> See [[African giant shrew #Taxonomy]].\n*Dogs/Jackals ([[Anubis]])\n**Dogs were used as domestic pets, guardians, herders, and police assistants. Several dog breeds could be found in ancient Egypt, the most popular being the greyhound, basenji, and saluki, all very good for hunting. From the First Dynasty, Egyptians venerated several jackal deities, with the most prominent one was of Anubis. He was represented as a canine or a canine headed human. Traditionally, the Anubis animal has been identified as a jackal, but its generally black coloring, symbolic of the afterlife and rebirth, is not typical of jackals and may instead denote a wild dog. Because dogs and jackals roamed the desert's edge, where the dead were generally buried, they were seen as protectors of cemeteries.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt|date=2013|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|pages=37\u201338}}</ref>\n*Birds of all types (Horus) (Birds were held in containers shaped like food because they would be used as food in the after life.)\n*Serpent/Eel ([[Atum]])\n**Among serpents and eels, snakes and lizards were also popular depictions of the god Atum. Serpents were seen as creatures of the earth that embody primeval, chthonic qualities, involved in the process of creation. Because many snakes inhabit marshes, they were closely linked to water and the primeval ocean of Nun. Egyptians were well aware of both the snake's usefulness in controlling vermin and the dangers posed by its poison. Texts like the [[Brooklyn Papyrus]] include remedies and magical spells to cure the bitten. Snake deities were worshipped in hopes of preventing potential attacks by their earthly representatives. Commonly mummified in the Late, Ptolemaic, and Roman periods, lizards did not play much of a role in earlier culture.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt|date=2013|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|pages=55\u201356}}</ref>\n*Beetles (Cherpera){{Citation needed|reason=There are few Google results for this \"Cherpera\" deity.|date=July 2018}}\n**Among beetles, the scarab was very popular in Egyptian culture. Images of scarabs were placed in tombs as early as the fourth millennium BCE and used as official seals and amulets for the living and the dead. The Egyptian word for scarab also means \"to come into being\" or \"appear\". A scarab pushing a spherical object evoked the image of a beetle propelling the sun disk through heaven.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt|date=2013|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|pages=59}}</ref>\n\n==== Sacred animals ====\nInstead of worshipping every animal of a particular species, a few animal cults would select one specific animal, chosen because of its special markings, to be the totem of the particular god. Each sacred animal was pampered and cared for until its death, when elaborate burial proceedings took place. The animal was then mummified as a sign of respect to the god. Next, a new symbolic animal was chosen. Only one animal at a time would be chosen as the sacred one. These animal cults reached the pinnacle of popularity during the Late and [[Graeco-Roman]] Periods. The cycle of selecting a new totem animal continued for hundreds of years. Though the animals were undoubtedly considered sacred, Egyptians did not worship the individual animals themselves, but rather the invisible deity believed to be present within the animal symbolizing the god. In certain cases, such as the Apis bull, the animal could even be a way to communicate the desires of the god. The Apis [[bull cult]] was the main source of this type of religious animal mummy in ancient Egypt, as most other animals were mummified in large quantities for religious offerings.\n\n===== Bulls =====\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThe [[Apis (god)|Apis]] bull cult is estimated to have originated as early as 800 B.C., the first cult supported by archaeological evidence. The earliest and largest of all animal cults, the Apis bull cult considered the bull to be a symbol of strength and fertility, representing the creator gods Ptah and Osiris. Mummification was a key part in the worshipping of these animals. While alive, the bull would be housed in a special temple, lavishly pampered for its entire life. Priests believed that the Apis bull was a medium of communication between the two creator gods, so its movements were carefully observed and sometimes consulted as an oracle. These sacred animals were allowed to die a natural death unless they reached the age of 28, at which time they were killed. When an Apis bull died, the entire country went into mourning. It was afforded an elaborate funeral and intricate burial procedures. Because the bulls were so large, the process of mummification was lengthy and complicated. Enormous alabaster embalming tables were constructed at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], the center of the cult. They were complete with engravings and fluid drainage channels. After the funerary ceremonies, the bull would be transported to these tables where it would be strapped to the table. Its internal organs would be destroyed through intra-anal oils. The animal's body would be dried out using [[natron]] salts and packed with sand. It would then be wrapped in linens. Artificial eyes and an artistic plaster head would be added, ensuring the bull still looked like itself.\n\n== Differences between human and non-human animal mummification ==\nThe distinguishing factor between the process of non-human animal and human mummification is when the two types were mummified. Humans had been mummified consistently since the days of the early conquerors of [[Lower Egypt]], hundreds of years before even the first non-human animal was mummified. The earliest signs of non-human animal mummies are dated to the [[Badarian]] [[Predynastic Period]] (5500\u20134000BC) before the unification of upper and lower Egypt.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} It is likely that animal mummies did not exist earlier on because mummification was less accessible primarily due to cost. \nIn general, the mummifying of animals was not given the careful attention afforded to humans. Mummies sold to pilgrims as offerings were only minimally treated, and unlike humans, even the most sacred of animals, such as the Apis bulls, did not have their internal organs preserved. The large scale of production indicates that relatively little care and expense was involved in animal preparation compared to human mummies. However, recent radiological studies by archeologists indicate that animal mummification may more closely follow human mummification than was originally thought. The accepted view is that animals were merely wrapped in coarse linen bandages and/or dipped in resin after death. However, as with human mummification there was a range in terms of the quality of treatments. A simple visual analysis of the mummies suggests that some animal mummies were treated with the same complexity as those of humans. Egyptians treated animals with great respect, regarding them both as domestic pets and representatives of the gods. The presence of fats, oils, beeswax, sugar gum, petroleum bitumen, and coniferous cedar resins in animal mummies shows that the chemicals used to embalm animals were similar to those used on humans.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Mummies}}\n{{Ancient Egypt topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Animal Mummy}}\n[[Category:Domesticated animals|Mummies]]\n[[Category:Ancient Egyptian culture]]\n[[Category:Ancient Egyptian mummies|*Animal mummies]]\n[[Category:Votive offering]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:British museum, Egypt mummies of animals (4423733728).jpg|thumb|Egyptian mummies of animals in the [[British Museum]].]]\n'''Animal mummification''' were common in [[ancient Egypt]].

Two main types of worship distinguished the cults\u2014the first choosing to worship the god through mass mummified animal offerings and the second selecting a totem animal to represent the god,<ref name=\"Aufderheide\" /> which was mummified at the time of its death.\n\n==== Votive offerings====\nThe vast majority of Egyptian animal mummies were religious offerings.<ref name=\"Brier\" /> If an Egyptian sought a favor from a deity, an offering would be made or purchased, and placed at the appropriate temple of the god.<ref name=\"Velde\"/> Before animal mummification became common, these offerings were usually bronze statues depicting the animals.<ref name=\"Brier\" /> However, eventually a cheaper alternative to bronze statues\u2014animal mummies\u2014became the most popular form of offering. Literally millions of these mummified animals have been discovered throughout Egypt. Inspection of these mummies, usually done through CT scans which allow researchers to examine the skeletons of the mummies without damaging the outer wrappings, has suggested that these types of animals were bred for the sole purpose of offerings. As the process of animal mummification for the purpose of offerings grew, mummification techniques became progressively less meticulous. Studies have revealed many of the large-scale animal offerings to be \u2018fakes\u2019 \u2014 the wrappings containing only a few bones, feathers, reeds, wood, or pieces of pottery. The animals were raised on temple grounds, and then sold to pilgrims or regular citizens. The necks of the animals were often broken, an indication that their sole purpose in life was to be sacrificed as offerings. When visiting the temples, Egyptians of the general public would purchase these pre-mummified animals and offer them to the gods.\n\nThe Egyptian god Hor, living in the second century BCE suggests the purpose underlying the practice of mummifying animals: \"The benefit [of mummification] which is performed for the Ibis, the soul of Toth, the greatest one, is made for the Hawk also, the soul of Ptah, the soul of Apis, the soul of Pre, the soul of Shu, the soul of Tefnut, the soul of Geb, the soul of Osiris, the soul of Isis, the soul of Nephtys, the great gods of Egypt, the Ibis and the Hawk.\" Hor believes that the mummies are the souls of the gods: he describes the ibis as the soul of Toth and the hawk as the soul of many different gods. That is to say, some animals were, or contained, a ''ba''- a part of the soul that is an active agents in this world and the spiritual world. Therefore, votive animal mummies are the animals' souls acted as messengers between people on earth and the gods.<ref>Bleiberg, Edward, '' Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt'', Brooklyn Museum: 2013.</ref>\n\n===== Cats =====\n{{see also|Cats in ancient Egypt#Funerary traditions}}\n[[File:Louvre egyptologie 21.jpg|right|thumb|A [[mummy|mummified]] cat]]\nCats were mummified as religious offerings in enormous quantities and were believed to represent the war goddess [[Bastet]]. This cult was primarily centered at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and [[Beni Hasan]] beginning in the [[Ptolemaic Period]]. In addition, thousands of cat mummies have been found at the catacombs of [[Saqqara]]. Cats who were bred to become offerings of this type usually died due to strangulation or the breaking of their necks. During mummification, the cat bodies would be dried and filled with soil, sand or some other kind of packing material. They were either positioned with their limbs folded closely to their bodies or in a sitting, lifelike position. The wrapping was usually completed through intricate, geometric patterns. Early in the development of animal mummification, cat mummies were placed in little bronze or wooden sarcophagi. More expensive mummies were typically adorned with features drawn in black paint and colored glass, obsidian or rock crystal eyes. Kittens and fetuses were mummified and buried inside the stomach of a statue that represented their mother. As time went by, like all mummies designed for this purpose, the mummification became less precise. In fact, Sir [[T. C. S. Morrison-Scott]], former Director of the [[British Museum of Natural History]], unwrapped a large number of cat mummies, but discovered many were simply stuffed with random body parts of cats and not mummified with detailed care.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===== Ibises =====\n[[File:Ibis Coffin, 305-30 B.C.E., 49.48.jpg|thumb|Ibis Coffin, 305-30 B.C.E., 49.48, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nThe [[ibis]] cult was established primarily during the [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods and was dedicated to the god of wisdom, [[Thoth]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp455-fs14/2014/09/25/animal-mummification/|title=Animal Mummification|date=2014-09-25|work=Archaeology of Ancient Egypt|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}</ref>  Research from 2015 using 14C radiocarbon dating suggests that the Egyptian Ibis mummies in the study were from time frame that falls between approximately 450 and 250 BC.

Saqqara alone is estimated to contain nearly 500,000 of these mummies and is also thought to have produced 10,000 mummified offerings per year. In addition, approximately four million ibis burials have been uncovered at the catacombs of [[Tuna el-Gebel]]. Mummification of the ibis included desiccation and evisceration. Usually, the head and neck of the bird were bent backwards and pressed on the body. The body was then dipped in tar and wrapped tightly with linen. The vast number of mummified ibises suggests that this was done in a mass production, as many times the mummies contained only a part of the body. After serving their ritual purposes, the mummified bodies were placed in ceramic pots, coffins or sarcophagi.\n\n===== Baboons =====\n[[File:Egyptian - Baboon Mummy Coffin - Walters 22245.jpg|thumb|This coffin, shaped like a baboon, once contained the remains of a baboon as an offering to the god [[Thoth]]. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]\nBaboons also represented [[Thoth]], the god of the moon as well as the god of wisdom. The appearance of baboons on [[canopic jar]]s, which housed the organs of human mummies, is testament of the animals\u2019 tremendous cultural significance. Baboons were reared in mass quantities at temples, though the numbers of baboon mummies that have been discovered are not as large as cats or ibises. Around 400 were uncovered at the tombs of Saqqara. Most baboons were mummified with the use of plaster and buried in wooden chests. Baboon mummies that have been discovered have provided significant evidence that they were bred and mummified as offerings. This evidence includes proof that the baboons usually did not die from natural causes, and that the majority suffered from malnutrition, fractures, [[osteomylitis]], and vitamin D deficiency.\n\n===== Crocodiles =====\nThe crocodile was regarded as an extremely fierce animal, often used to terrify enemies during war. The crocodile cult was devoted to [[Sebek]], god of fertility, and the sun god, Re. Typically, crocodiles were raised in a life of complete luxury, indulged until they died. In the early years of this cult, dead crocodiles were lavishly mummified with gold and other precious things. However, as mummification gradually became a production process, less effort was exerted in their mummification and eventually consisted simply of cloth wrappings and the application of resin, a preserving agent. When found in extremely large quantities, crocodile mummies, like many other sorts of animal offerings, contained only reeds or random body parts.\nAt the main temple of Shedet, later called Crocodilopolis, sacred crocodiles were mummified and displayed in temple shrines or carried in processions.<ref>[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg, Edward]], '' Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt'', Brooklyn Museum: 2013.</ref>\n\n===== Fish =====\nFish were mummified in mass quantities as offerings to the god. They were wrapped in linen and held together by bands of cloth soaked in sticky resin, permanently encasing the mummies. Many times, black circles representing the eyes were painted on the hardened linen. Several species of fish have been identified, but due to the deteriorating condition of the mummies, scientists are unable to conclude if the organs were typically removed during the process of mummification. According to the Museum of Liverpool the Nile perch was one of the species mummified and offered to the gods on of these cults is related to The goddess [[Neith]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/wml/collections/antiquities/ancient-egypt/item-391503.aspx|title=Fish Mummy, Ancient Egypt collection|website=www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref>\n\n===== Miscellaneous animals =====\n[[File:Dog Mummy, 305 B.C.E.-395 C.E.,05.308.jpg|thumbnail|Dog Mummy, 305 B.C.E.-395 C.E.,05.308, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nAdditional animals mummified and the corresponding god they represented:<ref name=\"Cairo\" />\n*Mongoose/Shrew ([[Horus]])\n**A large type of mongoose common in Africa, the ichneumon (''Herpestes ichneumon'') is represented in Egyptian art from the Old Kingdom onward. Revered for its ability to kill snakes, the ichneumon was related to Horus and Atum, among others and worshipped throughout the country. The shrew, a mouse size nocturnal mammal, substituted for ichneumons in Egyptian myth. Believed to have vision in both light and darkness, the god Horus Khenty-irty of Letopolis was represented by the wide eyed type of ichneumon and the shrew respectively. Shrews appear as the focus of worship particularly in the Late Period.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt|date=2013|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|pages=46\u201349}}</ref> See [[African giant shrew #Taxonomy]].\n*Dogs/Jackals ([[Anubis]])\n**Dogs were used as domestic pets, guardians, herders, and police assistants. Several dog breeds could be found in ancient Egypt, the most popular being the greyhound, basenji, and saluki, all very good for hunting. From the First Dynasty, Egyptians venerated several jackal deities, with the most prominent one was of Anubis. He was represented as a canine or a canine headed human. Traditionally, the Anubis animal has been identified as a jackal, but its generally black coloring, symbolic of the afterlife and rebirth, is not typical of jackals and may instead denote a wild dog. Because dogs and jackals roamed the desert's edge, where the dead were generally buried, they were seen as protectors of cemeteries.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt|date=2013|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|pages=37\u201338}}</ref>\n*Birds of all types (Horus) (Birds were held in containers shaped like food because they would be used as food in the after life.)\n*Serpent/Eel ([[Atum]])\n**Among serpents and eels, snakes and lizards were also popular depictions of the god Atum. Serpents were seen as creatures of the earth that embody primeval, chthonic qualities, involved in the process of creation. Because many snakes inhabit marshes, they were closely linked to water and the primeval ocean of Nun. Egyptians were well aware of both the snake's usefulness in controlling vermin and the dangers posed by its poison. Texts like the [[Brooklyn Papyrus]] include remedies and magical spells to cure the bitten. Snake deities were worshipped in hopes of preventing potential attacks by their earthly representatives. Commonly mummified in the Late, Ptolemaic, and Roman periods, lizards did not play much of a role in earlier culture.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt|date=2013|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|pages=55\u201356}}</ref>\n*Beetles (Cherpera){{Citation needed|reason=There are few Google results for this \"Cherpera\" deity.|date=July 2018}}\n**Among beetles, the scarab was very popular in Egyptian culture. Images of scarabs were placed in tombs as early as the fourth millennium BCE and used as official seals and amulets for the living and the dead. The Egyptian word for scarab also means \"to come into being\" or \"appear\". A scarab pushing a spherical object evoked the image of a beetle propelling the sun disk through heaven.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt|date=2013|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|pages=59}}</ref>\n\n==== Sacred animals ====\nInstead of worshipping every animal of a particular species, a few animal cults would select one specific animal, chosen because of its special markings, to be the totem of the particular god. Each sacred animal was pampered and cared for until its death, when elaborate burial proceedings took place. The animal was then mummified as a sign of respect to the god. Next, a new symbolic animal was chosen. Only one animal at a time would be chosen as the sacred one. These animal cults reached the pinnacle of popularity during the Late and [[Graeco-Roman]] Periods. The cycle of selecting a new totem animal continued for hundreds of years. Though the animals were undoubtedly considered sacred, Egyptians did not worship the individual animals themselves, but rather the invisible deity believed to be present within the animal symbolizing the god. In certain cases, such as the Apis bull, the animal could even be a way to communicate the desires of the god. The Apis [[bull cult]] was the main source of this type of religious animal mummy in ancient Egypt, as most other animals were mummified in large quantities for religious offerings.\n\n===== Bulls =====\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThe [[Apis (god)|Apis]] bull cult is estimated to have originated as early as 800 B.C., the first cult supported by archaeological evidence. The earliest and largest of all animal cults, the Apis bull cult considered the bull to be a symbol of strength and fertility, representing the creator gods Ptah and Osiris. Mummification was a key part in the worshipping of these animals. While alive, the bull would be housed in a special temple, lavishly pampered for its entire life. Priests believed that the Apis bull was a medium of communication between the two creator gods, so its movements were carefully observed and sometimes consulted as an oracle. These sacred animals were allowed to die a natural death unless they reached the age of 28, at which time they were killed. When an Apis bull died, the entire country went into mourning. It was afforded an elaborate funeral and intricate burial procedures. Because the bulls were so large, the process of mummification was lengthy and complicated. Enormous alabaster embalming tables were constructed at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], the center of the cult. They were complete with engravings and fluid drainage channels. After the funerary ceremonies, the bull would be transported to these tables where it would be strapped to the table. Its internal organs would be destroyed through intra-anal oils. The animal's body would be dried out using [[natron]] salts and packed with sand. It would then be wrapped in linens. Artificial eyes and an artistic plaster head would be added, ensuring the bull still looked like itself.\n\n== Differences between human and non-human animal mummification ==\nThe distinguishing factor between the process of non-human animal and human mummification is when the two types were mummified. Humans had been mummified consistently since the days of the early conquerors of [[Lower Egypt]], hundreds of years before even the first non-human animal was mummified. The earliest signs of non-human animal mummies are dated to the [[Badarian]] [[Predynastic Period]] (5500\u20134000BC) before the unification of upper and lower Egypt.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} It is likely that animal mummies did not exist earlier on because mummification was less accessible primarily due to cost. \nIn general, the mummifying of animals was not given the careful attention afforded to humans. Mummies sold to pilgrims as offerings were only minimally treated, and unlike humans, even the most sacred of animals, such as the Apis bulls, did not have their internal organs preserved. The large scale of production indicates that relatively little care and expense was involved in animal preparation compared to human mummies. However, recent radiological studies by archeologists indicate that animal mummification may more closely follow human mummification than was originally thought. The accepted view is that animals were merely wrapped in coarse linen bandages and/or dipped in resin after death. However, as with human mummification there was a range in terms of the quality of treatments. A simple visual analysis of the mummies suggests that some animal mummies were treated with the same complexity as those of humans. Egyptians treated animals with great respect, regarding them both as domestic pets and representatives of the gods. The presence of fats, oils, beeswax, sugar gum, petroleum bitumen, and coniferous cedar resins in animal mummies shows that the chemicals used to embalm animals were similar to those used on humans.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Mummies}}\n{{Ancient Egypt topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Animal Mummy}}\n[[Category:Domesticated animals|Mummies]]\n[[Category:Ancient Egyptian culture]]\n[[Category:Ancient Egyptian mummies|*Animal mummies]]\n[[Category:Votive offering]]\n", "name_user": "Sietecolores", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_mummy"}

At this boundary two layers of charge with opposing polarity form, one at the surface of the electrode, and one in the electrolyte. These two layers, electrons on the electrode and ions in the electrolyte, are typically separated by a single layer of solvent molecules that [[Adhesion|adhere]] to the surface of the electrode and act like a [[dielectric]] in a conventional [[capacitor]]. The amount of [[electric charge]] stored in double-layer capacitor depends on  the applied [[voltage]]. The unit of capacitance is the [[farad]].\n\n== History ==\n* Development of the double layer and pseudocapacitance model see [[Double layer (interfacial)]]\n* Development of the electrochemical components see [[Supercapacitor]]s\n\n== Capacitance  ==\n{{See also|Supercapacitor}}[[File:EDLC-simplified-principle.png|thumb|right|250px| Simplified view of a double-layer of negative ions in the electrode and solvated positive ions in the liquid electrolyte, separated by a layer of polarized solvent molecules.]]\n\n[[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] laid the theoretical foundations for understanding the double layer phenomenon. The formation of double layers is exploited in every [[Supercapacitor|electrochemical capacitor]] to store electrical energy.\n\nEvery capacitor has two electrodes, mechanically separated by a separator. These are electrically connected via the electrolyte, a mixture of positive and negative ions dissolved in a [[solvent]] such as water. Where the liquid electrolyte contacts the electrode's conductive metallic surface, an interface is formed which represents a common boundary between the two phases of matter. It is at this interface that the double layer effect occurs.<ref name=Stojek /><ref name=\"EDL\" />\n\nWhen a voltage is applied to the capacitor, two layers of polarized ions are generated<!-- do you want to say \"adjacent to the electrode in the electrolyte solution\" --> at the electrode interfaces. One layer is within the solid electrode (at the surfaces of crystal grains from which it is made that are in contact with the electrolyte). The other layer, with opposite polarity, forms from [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissolved]] and [[Solvation|solvated]] ions distributed in the electrolyte that have moved towards the polarized electrode. These two layers of polarized ions are separated by a monolayer of solvent [[molecules]]. The molecular monolayer forms the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). It adheres by physical [[adsorption]] on the electrode surface and separates the oppositely polarized ions from each other, forming a molecular [[dielectric]].\n\nThe amount of charge in the electrode is matched by the magnitude of counter-charges in the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP). This is the area close to the IHP, in which the polarized electrolyte ions are collected. This separation of two layers of polarized ions through the double-layer stores electrical charges in the same way as in a conventional capacitor. The double-layer charge forms a [[Static electricity|static electric]] [[Electric field|field]] in the molecular IHP layer of the solvent molecules that corresponds to the strength of the applied voltage.\n\nThe \"thickness\" of a charged layer in the metallic electrode, i.e., the average extension perpendicular to the surface, is about 0.1&nbsp;nm, and mainly depends on the electron density because the atoms in solid electrodes are stationary. In the electrolyte, the thickness depends on the size of the solvent molecules and of the movement and concentration of ions in the solvent. It ranges from 0.1 to 10&nbsp;nm as described by the [[Debye length]]. The sum of the thicknesses is the total thickness of a double layer.\n\nThe IHP's small thickness creates a strong electric field E over the separating solvent molecules. At a potential difference of, for example, U = 2&nbsp;V and a molecular thickness of d = 0.4&nbsp;nm, the electric field strength is\n\n:<math>E = \\frac{U}{d} = \\frac{2\\ \\text{V}}{0{,}4\\ \\text{nm}} = 5000\\ \\text{kV/mm}</math>\n\nTo compare this figure with values from other capacitor types requires an estimation for [[electrolytic capacitors]], the capacitors with the thinnest dielectric among conventional capacitors. The voltage proof of [[aluminum oxide]], the dielectric layer of aluminum electrolytic capacitors, is approximately 1.4&nbsp;nm/V. For a 6.3&nbsp;V capacitor therefore the layer is 8.8&nbsp;nm. The electric field is 6.3&nbsp;V/8.8&nbsp;nm = 716&nbsp;kV/mm, around 7 times lower than in the double-layer. The [[field strength]] of some 5000&nbsp;kV/mm is unrealizable in conventional capacitors. No conventional dielectric material could prevent charge carrier breakthrough. In a double-layer capacitor the chemical stability of the solvent's molecular bonds prevents breakthrough.<ref>Daniel Gr\u00e4ser, Christoph Schmid: ''Supercap, Grundlagen - Eigenschaften \u2013 Anwendungen.'' Berner Fachhochschule, Semesterarbeit in Technologie und Deutsch ([http://home.datacomm.ch/graeser/Dateien/supercap.pdf PDF]).</ref>\n\nThe forces that cause the adhesion of solvent molecules in the IHP are physical forces rather than chemical bonds. Chemical bonds exist within the adsorbed molecules, but they are polarized.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric charge that can accumulate in the layers corresponds to the concentration of the adsorbed ions and the electrodes surface. Up to the electrolyte's [[Electrical breakdown|decomposition voltage]], this arrangement behaves like a capacitor in which the stored electrical charge is linearly dependent on the [[voltage]].\n \n[[File:EDLC-Charge-Distribution.png|thumb|right|300px|Structure and function of an ideal double-layer capacitor.  Applying a voltage to the capacitor at both electrodes a Helmholtz double-layer will be formed separating the adhered ions in the electrolyte in a mirror charge distribution of opposite polarity]]\n\nThe double-layer is like the dielectric layer in a conventional capacitor, but with the thickness of a single molecule.

At this boundary two layers of charge with opposing polarity form, one at the surface of the electrode, and one in the electrolyte. These two layers, electrons on the electrode and ions in the electrolyte, are typically separated by a single layer of solvent molecules that [[Adhesion|adhere]] to the surface of the electrode and act like a [[dielectric]] in a conventional [[capacitor]]. The amount of [[electric charge]] stored in double-layer capacitor depends on  the applied [[voltage]]. The unit of capacitance is the [[farad]].\n\n== History ==\n* Development of the double layer and pseudocapacitance model see [[Double layer (interfacial)]]\n* Development of the electrochemical components see [[Supercapacitor]]s\n\n== Capacitance  ==\n{{See also|Supercapacitor}}[[File:EDLC-simplified-principle.png|thumb|right|250px| Simplified view of a double-layer of negative ions in the electrode and solvated positive ions in the liquid electrolyte, separated by a layer of polarized solvent molecules.]]\n\n[[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] laid the theoretical foundations for understanding the double layer phenomenon. The formation of double layers is exploited in every [[Supercapacitor|electrochemical capacitor]] to store electrical energy.\n\nEvery capacitor has two electrodes, mechanically separated by a separator. These are electrically connected via the electrolyte, a mixture of positive and negative ions dissolved in a [[solvent]] such as water. Where the liquid electrolyte contacts the electrode's conductive metallic surface, an interface is formed which represents a common boundary between the two phases of matter. It is at this interface that the double layer effect occurs.<ref name=Stojek /><ref name=\"EDL\" />\n\nWhen a voltage is applied to the capacitor, two layers of polarized ions are generated at the electrode interfaces. One layer is within the solid electrode (at the surfaces of crystal grains from which it is made that are in contact with the electrolyte). The other layer, with opposite polarity, forms from [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissolved]] and [[Solvation|solvated]] ions distributed in the electrolyte that have moved towards the polarized electrode. These two layers of polarized ions are separated by a monolayer of solvent [[molecules]]. The molecular monolayer forms the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). It adheres by physical [[adsorption]] on the electrode surface and separates the oppositely polarized ions from each other, forming a molecular [[dielectric]].\n\nThe amount of charge in the electrode is matched by the magnitude of counter-charges in the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP). This is the area close to the IHP, in which the polarized electrolyte ions are collected. This separation of two layers of polarized ions through the double-layer stores electrical charges in the same way as in a conventional capacitor. The double-layer charge forms a [[Static electricity|static electric]] [[Electric field|field]] in the molecular IHP layer of the solvent molecules that corresponds to the strength of the applied voltage.\n\nThe \"thickness\" of a charged layer in the metallic electrode, i.e., the average extension perpendicular to the surface, is about 0.1&nbsp;nm, and mainly depends on the electron density because the atoms in solid electrodes are stationary. In the electrolyte, the thickness depends on the size of the solvent molecules and of the movement and concentration of ions in the solvent. It ranges from 0.1 to 10&nbsp;nm as described by the [[Debye length]]. The sum of the thicknesses is the total thickness of a double layer.\n\nThe IHP's small thickness creates a strong electric field E over the separating solvent molecules. At a potential difference of, for example, U = 2&nbsp;V and a molecular thickness of d = 0.4&nbsp;nm, the electric field strength is\n\n:<math>E = \\frac{U}{d} = \\frac{2\\ \\text{V}}{0{,}4\\ \\text{nm}} = 5000\\ \\text{kV/mm}</math>\n\nTo compare this figure with values from other capacitor types requires an estimation for [[electrolytic capacitors]], the capacitors with the thinnest dielectric among conventional capacitors. The voltage proof of [[aluminum oxide]], the dielectric layer of aluminum electrolytic capacitors, is approximately 1.4&nbsp;nm/V. For a 6.3&nbsp;V capacitor therefore the layer is 8.8&nbsp;nm. The electric field is 6.3&nbsp;V/8.8&nbsp;nm = 716&nbsp;kV/mm, around 7 times lower than in the double-layer. The [[field strength]] of some 5000&nbsp;kV/mm is unrealizable in conventional capacitors. No conventional dielectric material could prevent charge carrier breakthrough. In a double-layer capacitor the chemical stability of the solvent's molecular bonds prevents breakthrough.<ref>Daniel Gr\u00e4ser, Christoph Schmid: ''Supercap, Grundlagen - Eigenschaften \u2013 Anwendungen.'' Berner Fachhochschule, Semesterarbeit in Technologie und Deutsch ([http://home.datacomm.ch/graeser/Dateien/supercap.pdf PDF]).</ref>\n\nThe forces that cause the adhesion of solvent molecules in the IHP are physical forces rather than chemical bonds. Chemical bonds exist within the adsorbed molecules, but they are polarized.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric charge that can accumulate in the layers corresponds to the concentration of the adsorbed ions and the electrodes surface. Up to the electrolyte's [[Electrical breakdown|decomposition voltage]], this arrangement behaves like a capacitor in which the stored electrical charge is linearly dependent on the [[voltage]].\n \n[[File:EDLC-Charge-Distribution.png|thumb|right|300px|Structure and function of an ideal double-layer capacitor.  Applying a voltage to the capacitor at both electrodes a Helmholtz double-layer will be formed separating the adhered ions in the electrolyte in a mirror charge distribution of opposite polarity]]\n\nThe double-layer is like the dielectric layer in a conventional capacitor, but with the thickness of a single molecule.

At that time, the National Defense Commission was a commission subordinate to the Central People\u2019s Committee, which was the highest leadership institution in North Korea from 1972 until 1998.\n\nThe 1972 North Korean constitution stated that the [[President of North Korea]] is also the Chairman of the National Defense Commission, as well as the supreme commander of the country\u2019s armed forces. [[Kim Il-sung]], who was the President of North Korea, was the Chairman of the National Defense Commission from 28 December 1972 until 9 April 1993.\n\nOn 22 May 1992, the position became known as the '''Chairman of the National Defense Commission of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea''' (Korean: \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d \uad6d\ubc29\uc704\uc6d0\ud68c \uc704\uc6d0\uc7a5) following the approval of an amendment to the 1972 constitution that made the National Defense Commission into a separate institution from the Central People\u2019s Committee. The amendment expanded the Chairman\u2019s powers to become the head of the highest military leadership institution in North Korea.\n\nThe 1992 constitutional amendment no longer required the President to also be the Chairman of the National Defense Commission and the supreme commander of the armed forces. This allowed [[Kim Jong-il]], who is Kim Il-sung\u2019s designated successor, to be elected as Chairman of the National Defense Commission on 9 April 1993. Prior to his election, Kim Jong-il was elected as first vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission on 24 May 1990 and became the supreme commander of the [[Korean People's Army|Korean People\u2019s Army]] on 24 December 1991.\n\nFollowing [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il-sung|Kim Il-sung\u2019s death on 8 July 1994]], another constitutional amendment was approved on 5 September 1998 which further expanded the powers of the Chairman of the National Defense Commission. The amendment enshrined Kim Il-sung as North Korea\u2019s eternal President and abolished the position. While it is not stated by the amended constitution, the National Defense Commission became the de facto highest leadership institution in the country with its Chairman holding the highest office of the state.\n\nDespite the 1998 constitutional amendment effectively making the Chairman of the National Defense Commission the highest office in North Korea, it did not have the status of head of state. The [[President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly|President of the Presidium of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly]] was designated as the country\u2019s head of state from 1998 until 2019.\n\nOn 9 April 2009, the powers of the Chairman of the National Defense Commission was expanded through another constitutional amendment. The amendment designated the Chairman as the supreme leader of the country. The Chairman was given the power to direct all state affairs and conclude important treaties with foreign countries. The Chairman can also appoint or dismiss important national defense officials, grant special pardons, declare a state of emergency and a state of war and issue mobilization order.\n\nAfter his election as Chairman of the National Defense Commission in 1993, Kim Jong-il was re-elected in September 1998, September 2003 and April 2009, and served in this position until [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|his death on 17 December 2011]].\n\n=== First Chairman of the National Defense Commission ===\nFollowing Kim Jong Il\u2019s death, the position of Chairman of the National Defense Commission remained vacant from December 2011 until April 2012.\n\nA constitutional amendment was approved on 13 April 2012 which enshrined Kim Jong Il as the '''eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea''' (Korean: \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d \uc601\uc6d0\ud55c \uad6d\ubc29\uc704\uc6d0\ud68c \uc704\uc6d0\uc7a5).

The amendment also created the position of Chairman of the State Affairs Commission.\n\nKim Jong-un was elected as Chairman of the State Affairs Commission on 29 June 2016 and was re-elected on 11 April 2019.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOn 11 April 2019, the constitution was amended to make the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission the head of state of North Korea. Another constitutional amendment on 29 August of the same year gave the Chairman the power to promulgate the ordinances of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly and the decrees and decisions of the State Affairs Commission and appoint North Korea\u2019s diplomatic representatives to foreign countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/30/north-korea-changes-constitution-to-solidify-kim-jong-uns-rule.html|title=North Korea changes constitution to solidify Kim Jong Un's rule|date=2019-08-30|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>\n\n== Election ==\nAccording to the Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission is elected by the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> It requires that the election should be according to the \u201cconsensus of the entire Korean people.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe election of the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission takes place during a session of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly.<ref name=\":2\" /> The [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea]] sends a proposal to the Supreme People's Assembly for a candidate to be elected as the SAC Chairman.

At that time, the National Defense Commission was a commission subordinate to the Central People\u2019s Committee, which was the highest leadership institution in North Korea from 1972 until 1998.\n\nThe 1972 North Korean constitution stated that the [[President of North Korea]] is also the Chairman of the National Defense Commission, as well as the supreme commander of the country\u2019s armed forces. [[Kim Il-sung]], who was the President of North Korea, was the Chairman of the National Defense Commission from 28 December 1972 until 9 April 1993.\n\nOn 22 May 1992, the position became known as the '''Chairman of the National Defense Commission of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea''' (Korean: \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d \uad6d\ubc29\uc704\uc6d0\ud68c \uc704\uc6d0\uc7a5) following the approval of an amendment to the 1972 constitution that made the National Defense Commission into a separate institution from the Central People\u2019s Committee. The amendment expanded the Chairman\u2019s powers to become the head of the highest military leadership institution in North Korea.\n\nThe 1992 constitutional amendment no longer required the President to also be the Chairman of the National Defense Commission and the supreme commander of the armed forces. This allowed [[Kim Jong-il]], who is Kim Il-sung\u2019s designated successor, to be elected as Chairman of the National Defense Commission on 9 April 1993. Prior to his election, Kim Jong-il was elected as first vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission on 24 May 1990 and became the supreme commander of the [[Korean People's Army|Korean People\u2019s Army]] on 24 December 1991.\n\nFollowing [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il-sung|Kim Il-sung\u2019s death on 8 July 1994]], another constitutional amendment was approved on 5 September 1998 which further expanded the powers of the Chairman of the National Defense Commission. The amendment enshrined Kim Il-sung as North Korea\u2019s eternal President and abolished the position. While it is not stated by the amended constitution, the National Defense Commission became the de facto highest leadership institution in the country with its Chairman holding the highest office of the state.\n\nDespite the 1998 constitutional amendment effectively making the Chairman of the National Defense Commission the highest office in North Korea, it did not have the status of head of state. The [[President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly|President of the Presidium of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly]] was designated as the country\u2019s head of state from 1998 until 2019.\n\nOn 9 April 2009, the powers of the Chairman of the National Defense Commission was expanded through another constitutional amendment. The amendment designated the Chairman as the supreme leader of the country. The Chairman was given the power to direct all state affairs and conclude important treaties with foreign countries. The Chairman can also appoint or dismiss important national defense officials, grant special pardons, declare a state of emergency and a state of war and issue mobilization order.\n\nAfter his election as Chairman of the National Defense Commission in 1993, Kim Jong-il was re-elected in September 1998, September 2003 and April 2009, and served in this position until [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|his death on 17 December 2011]].\n\n=== First Chairman of the National Defense Commission ===\nFollowing Kim Jong Il\u2019s death, the position of Chairman of the National Defense Commission remained vacant from December 2011 until April 2012.\n\nA constitutional amendment was approved on 13 April 2012 which enshrined Kim Jong Il as the '''eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea''' (Korean: \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d \uc601\uc6d0\ud55c \uad6d\ubc29\uc704\uc6d0\ud68c \uc704\uc6d0\uc7a5).

The amendment also created the position of Chairman of the State Affairs Commission.\n\nKim Jong-un was elected as Chairman of the State Affairs Commission on 29 June 2016 and was re-elected on 11 April 2019.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOn 11 April 2019, the constitution was amended to make the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission the head of state of North Korea. Another constitutional amendment on 29 August of the same year gave the Chairman the power to promulgate the ordinances of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly and the decrees and decisions of the State Affairs Commission and appoint North Korea\u2019s diplomatic representatives to foreign countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/30/north-korea-changes-constitution-to-solidify-kim-jong-uns-rule.html|title=North Korea changes constitution to solidify Kim Jong Un's rule|date=2019-08-30|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>\n\n== Election ==\nAccording to the Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission is elected by the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> It requires that the election should be according to the \u201cconsensus of the entire Korean people.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe election of the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission takes place during a session of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly.<ref name=\":2\" /> The [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea]] sends a proposal to the Supreme People's Assembly for a candidate to be elected as the SAC Chairman.

The EP debuted at number one on the [[Gaon Album Chart]] and yielded two singles: \"VVIP\" and \"What Can I Do\" (Korean: \uc5b4\uca4c\ub77c\uace0; Revised Romanization: ''Eojjeolago'').

In 2018, he released his first Korean studio album, the chart-topper ''[[The Great Seungri]]'' and embarked on his [[The Great Seungri (tour)|first world tour]] as a solo artist.\n\nMaking his theatrical debut with the musical ''Sonagi'' in 2008, Seungri went on to star in films such as ''[[19-Nineteen|Nineteen]]'' and ''Why Did You Come to My House?'', both released in 2009. He branched into television with the Japanese drama ''Kindaichi Shonen no Jikenbo'' (2013) and the South Korean television series [[Angel Eyes (TV series)|''Angel Eyes'']] (2014).
