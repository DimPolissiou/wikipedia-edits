The [[Covenant (biblical)#Noahic covenant|Noahic Covenant]] (in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]), which is between God and all living creatures, as well as a number of more specific covenants with individuals or groups. Biblical covenants include those with Abraham, the whole Israelite people, the Israelite priesthood, and the Davidic lineage of kings. In form and terminology, these covenants echo the kinds of treaty agreements in the surrounding ancient world.\n\nIn the [[Book of Jeremiah]], verses {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|31:30\u201333|HE}} predict \"a new covenant\" that God will establish with \"the house of Israel\". Most [[Christian theology|Christians believe]] this [[New Covenant#Christianity|New Covenant]] is the [[Supersessionism|\"replacement\" or \"final fulfilment\"]] of the [[Old Covenant]] described in the [[Old Testament]] and as applying to the [[People of God]], while some believe both covenants are still applicable in a [[dual covenant theology]].\n\n==Ancient Near Eastern treaties==\nThe Hebrew term [[:wikt:\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea|\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea]]  ''b\u0115riyth'' for \"covenant\" is from a root with the sense of \"cutting\", because pacts or covenants were made by passing between cut pieces of flesh of the victim of an [[animal sacrifice]].<ref>''[[Strong's Concordance]]'' (1890).</ref>\n\nThere are two major types of covenants in the Hebrew Bible, including the obligatory type and the promissory type.<ref name=\"Weinfeld2005\">{{cite book|author=Moshe Weinfeld|title=Normative and Sectarian Judaism in the Second Temple Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QHUAwAAQBAJ|date=20 June 2005|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-567-04441-9|page=200}}</ref> The obligatory covenant is more common with the [[Hittites|Hittite]] peoples, and deals with the relationship between two parties of equal standing. In contrast, the promissory type of covenant is seen in the Abrahamic and Davidic covenants. Promissory covenants focus on the relationship between the suzerain and the vassal and are similar to the \"royal grant\" type of legal document, which include historical introduction, border delineations, stipulations, witnesses, blessings, and curses. In royal grants, the master could reward a servant for being loyal. God rewarded Abraham, Noah, and David in his covenants with them.<ref>Weinfeld, M. (2005).

United States: T & T Clark International.</ref> As part of his covenant with Abraham, God has the obligation to keep Abraham's descendants as God's chosen people and be their God. God acts as the suzerain power and is the party of the covenant accompanied by the required action that comes with the oath whether it be fire or animals in the sacrificial oaths.  In doing this, God is the party taking upon the curse if he does not uphold his obligation.  Through history there were also many instances where the vassal was the one who performed the different acts and took the curse upon them.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Terminology of covenants===\nWeinfeld believes that similar terminology and wording can connect the Abrahamic and Davidic covenants with ancient Near Eastern grants, as opposed to being largely similar to the Mosaic covenant, which, according to Weinfeld, is an example of a suzerainty treaty. He goes on to argue that phrases about having a \"whole heart\" or having \"walked after me [God] with all his heart\" strongly parallels with Neo-Assyrian grant language, such as \"walked with royalty\". He further argues that in Jeremiah, God uses prophetic metaphor to say that David will be adopted as a son. Expressing legal and political relationships through familial phraseology was common among Near Eastern cultures. Babylonian contracts often expressed fathership and sonship in their grants to actually mean a king to vassal relationship.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Weinfield|first1=M.|title=The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient near East|date=April\u2013June 1970|publisher=American Oriental Society|location=Jerusalem|pages=184\u2013203|edition=Vol 90|url=http://wisdomintorah.s3.amazonaws.com/medialibrary/Grants-and-covenant.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2015|ref=Journal of the American Oriental Society}}</ref>\n\nFurther underlying the idea that these covenants were grant-like in nature is the similar language used in both. In the grant of [[Ashurbanipal]], an Assyrian, to his servant Bulta, he describes Bulta's loyalty with the phrase \"kept the charge of my kinship\". Abraham similarly kept God's charge in Genesis 26: 4\u20135: \"I will give to your descendants all these lands...in as much as Abraham obeyed me and kept my charge, my commandments, my rules and my teachings.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Weinfeld|first1=M.|title=The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient near East|journal=American Oriental Society|date=April\u2013June 1970|volume=90|issue=2|pages=186\u2013188|ref=Journal of the American Oriental Society}}</ref>\n\n===Dissolving covenant form===\nAccording to Mendhenhall, pressures from outside invaders led the loosely bound Israelite tribes to converge into monarchical unity for stability and solidarity. He also argues that during this consolidation, the new state also had to unify the religious traditions that belonged to the different groups to prevent dissent from those who might believe that the formation of a state would replace direct governance from God. Therefore, Mendenhall continues, these loosely bound tribes merged under the Mosaic covenant to legitimize their unity. They believed that to obey the law was to obey God. They also believed that the king was put into power as a result of God's benefaction, and that this accession was the fulfillment of God's promise of dynasty to David. Mendenhall also notes that a conflict arose between those who believed in the Davidic covenant, and those who believed that God would not support all actions of the state. As a result, both sides became relatively aloof, and the Davidic covenant and the Mosaic covenant were almost entirely forgotten.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mendenhall|first1=George E.|title=Covenant Forms in Israelite Tradition|journal=The Biblical Archaeologist|date=September 1954|volume=17|issue=3|pages=70\u201373|publisher=The American Schools of Oriental Research|location=New Haven, Conn.|jstor=3209151|doi=10.2307/3209151}}</ref>\n\n==Number of biblical covenants==\nStudents of the Bible hold wildly differing opinions as to how many major covenants exist (or did exist) between God and humanity, with numbers ranging from one to at least twelve.\n(See [[covenant theology]] and [[dispensationalism]] for further information on two of the major viewpoints.) In the [[Religious text|Scripture]], there was a focus on three types of covenants, namely: the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] covenant, the [[Mosaic covenant]], and the New Covenant mediated by Jesus.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Looking to Christ: The Book of Hebrews|last=Ogrosky|first=Marci|date=2014|publisher=WestBow Press|year=|isbn=978-1-4908-3998-1|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=95}}</ref> Some scholars classify only two: a covenant of promise and a covenant of law.

In Hebrew, the verb meaning to seal a covenant translates literally as \"to cut\". It is presumed by Jewish scholars that the removal of the [[foreskin]] symbolically represents such a sealing of the covenant.<ref>\"Circumcision.\" Mark Popovsky.

It is the obligation of the master to his servant and involves gifts given to individuals who were loyal serving their masters. In the covenant with Abraham in Genesis 15, it is God who is the suzerain who commits himself and swears to keep the promise. In the covenant there are procedures for taking the oath, which involve a smoking oven and a blazing torch. There are many similarities between Genesis 15 and the Abba-El deed. In Genesis 15 and similarly in the Abba-El deed, it is the superior party who places himself under oath. The oaths in both, moreover, involve a situation wherein the inferior party delivers the animals while the superior party swears the oath. \n\nThe Abrahamic covenant is part of a tradition of covenantal sacrifices that dates back to the third millennium BC. The animals that are slaughtered in the covenant in Genesis 15 are considered a sacrificial offering. And it is that covenant which preserves the sacrificial element alongside the symbolic act.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Weinfeld|first1=M.|title=The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient near East|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=1970|volume= 90|issue= 2|pages=196\u2013199}}</ref>\n\n==Mosaic covenant==\n[[File:Ten Commandments Monument.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Ten Commandments]] on a monument on the grounds of the [[Texas State Capitol]]]]\n{{Main|Mosaic covenant}}\n{{See also|Ten Commandments|613 commandments|Law of Moses}}\nThe [[Mosaic covenant]] made with Moses and the Israelite people at Horeb-Sinai, which is found in {{bibleref2|Exodus|19\u201324}} and the book of [[Deuteronomy]], contains the foundations of the [[Torah|written Torah]] and the [[Oral Torah]].

The blood of sacrificial oxen is thereafter sprinkled on the altar and on the people to seal the covenant. \n\nBeyond its central religious purpose, the Mosaic covenant was also political.

The Davidic covenant is an important element in [[Jewish messianism]] and [[Christian theology]]. In [[Jewish eschatology]], the [[messiah]] is believed to be a future Jewish king from the [[Davidic line]], who will be anointed with [[holy anointing oil]], gather the Jews back into the [[Land of Israel]], usher in an era of peace, build the [[Third Temple]], have a male heir, re-institute the [[Sanhedrin]] and rule the Jewish people during the [[Messianic Age]].\n\nThe tablets of the Ten Commandments were kept in the [[Ark of the Covenant]], and this became the symbol of the Israelite nation, and of God's presence with His people. Thus when King David wanted to establish [[Ancient Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] as his own capital city he brought the Ark there (2 Sam 6).\n\n\"It is this picture of the covenant which colours most of our thinking about covenant in the Old Testament, and in the expression 'Law and Gospel' it represents the ''old covenant'' of the law [of Moses] in contrast with the ''new covenant'' of the gospel [of Jesus Christ].

In royal grants, the master could reward a servant for being loyal. God rewarded Abraham, Noah, and David in his covenants with them.<ref>Weinfeld, M. (2005).

United States: T & T Clark International.</ref> As part of his covenant with Abraham, God has the obligation to keep Abraham's descendants as God's chosen people and be their God. God acts as the suzerain power and is the party of the covenant accompanied by the required action that comes with the oath whether it be fire or animals in the sacrificial oaths.  In doing this, God is the party taking upon the curse if he does not uphold his obligation.  Through history there were also many instances where the vassal was the one who performed the different acts and took the curse upon them.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Terminology of covenants===\nWeinfeld believes that similar terminology and wording can connect the Abrahamic and Davidic covenants with ancient Near Eastern grants, as opposed to being largely similar to the Mosaic covenant, which, according to Weinfeld, is an example of a suzerainty treaty. He goes on to argue that phrases about having a \"whole heart\" or having \"walked after me [God] with all his heart\" strongly parallels with Neo-Assyrian grant language, such as \"walked with royalty\". He further argues that in Jeremiah, God uses prophetic metaphor to say that David will be adopted as a son. Expressing legal and political relationships through familial phraseology was common among Near Eastern cultures. Babylonian contracts often expressed fathership and sonship in their grants to actually mean a king to vassal relationship.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Weinfield|first1=M.|title=The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient near East|date=April\u2013June 1970|publisher=American Oriental Society|location=Jerusalem|pages=184\u2013203|edition=Vol 90|url=http://wisdomintorah.s3.amazonaws.com/medialibrary/Grants-and-covenant.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2015|ref=Journal of the American Oriental Society}}</ref>\n\nFurther underlying the idea that these covenants were grant-like in nature is the similar language used in both. In the grant of [[Ashurbanipal]], an Assyrian, to his servant Bulta, he describes Bulta's loyalty with the phrase \"kept the charge of my kinship\". Abraham similarly kept God's charge in Genesis 26: 4\u20135: \"I will give to your descendants all these lands...in as much as Abraham obeyed me and kept my charge, my commandments, my rules and my teachings.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Weinfeld|first1=M.|title=The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient near East|journal=American Oriental Society|date=April\u2013June 1970|volume=90|issue=2|pages=186\u2013188|ref=Journal of the American Oriental Society}}</ref>\n\n===Dissolving covenant form===\nAccording to Mendhenhall, pressures from outside invaders led the loosely bound Israelite tribes to converge into monarchical unity for stability and solidarity. He also argues that during this consolidation, the new state also had to unify the religious traditions that belonged to the different groups to prevent dissent from those who might believe that the formation of a state would replace direct governance from God. Therefore, Mendenhall continues, these loosely bound tribes merged under the Mosaic covenant to legitimize their unity. They believed that to obey the law was to obey God. They also believed that the king was put into power as a result of God's benefaction, and that this accession was the fulfillment of God's promise of dynasty to David. Mendenhall also notes that a conflict arose between those who believed in the Davidic covenant, and those who believed that God would not support all actions of the state. As a result, both sides became relatively aloof, and the Davidic covenant and the Mosaic covenant were almost entirely forgotten.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mendenhall|first1=George E.|title=Covenant Forms in Israelite Tradition|journal=The Biblical Archaeologist|date=September 1954|volume=17|issue=3|pages=70\u201373|publisher=The American Schools of Oriental Research|location=New Haven, Conn.|jstor=3209151|doi=10.2307/3209151}}</ref>\n\n==Number of biblical covenants==\nStudents of the Bible hold wildly differing opinions as to how many major covenants exist (or did exist) between God and humanity, with numbers ranging from one to at least twelve.\n(See [[covenant theology]] and [[dispensationalism]] for further information on two of the major viewpoints.)

It is the obligation of the master to his servant and involves gifts given to individuals who were loyal serving their masters. In the covenant with Abraham in Genesis 15, it is God who is the suzerain who commits himself and swears to keep the promise. In the covenant there are procedures for taking the oath, which involve a smoking oven and a blazing torch. There are many similarities between Genesis 15 and the Abba-El deed. In Genesis 15 and similarly in the Abba-El deed, it is the superior party who places himself under oath. The oaths in both, moreover, involve a situation wherein the inferior party delivers the animals while the superior party swears the oath. \n\nThe Abrahamic covenant is part of a tradition of covenantal sacrifices that dates back to the third millennium BC. The animals that are slaughtered in the covenant in Genesis 15 are considered a sacrificial offering. And it is that covenant which preserves the sacrificial element alongside the symbolic act.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Weinfeld|first1=M.|title=The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient near East|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=1970|volume= 90|issue= 2|pages=196\u2013199}}</ref>\n\n==Mosaic covenant==\n[[File:Ten Commandments Monument.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Ten Commandments]] on a monument on the grounds of the [[Texas State Capitol]]]]\n{{Main|Mosaic covenant}}\n{{See also|Ten Commandments|613 commandments|Law of Moses}}\nThe [[Mosaic covenant]] made with Moses and the Israelite people at Horeb-Sinai, which is found in {{bibleref2|Exodus|19\u201324}} and the book of [[Deuteronomy]], contains the foundations of the [[Torah|written Torah]] and the [[Oral Torah]].

The Davidic covenant is an important element in [[Jewish messianism]] and [[Christian theology]]. In [[Jewish eschatology]], the [[messiah]] is believed to be a future Jewish king from the [[Davidic line]], who will be anointed with [[holy anointing oil]], gather the Jews back into the [[Land of Israel]], usher in an era of peace, build the [[Third Temple]], have a male heir, re-institute the [[Sanhedrin]] and rule the Jewish people during the [[Messianic Age]].\n\nThe tablets of the Ten Commandments were kept in the [[Ark of the Covenant]], and this became the symbol of the Israelite nation, and of God's presence with His people. Thus when King David wanted to establish [[Ancient Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] as his own capital city he brought the Ark there (2 Sam 6).\n\n\"It is this picture of the covenant which colours most of our thinking about covenant in the Old Testament, and in the expression 'Law and Gospel' it represents the ''old covenant'' of the law [of Moses] in contrast with the ''new covenant'' of the gospel [of Jesus Christ].

Football Club]] in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL). Martin was drafted by Richmond with the third pick in the [[2009 AFL draft#2009 national draft|2009 national draft]], and made his AFL debut in the opening round of the 2010 season. He was nominated for the [[2010 AFL Rising Star]] award, but was ineligible to win due to suspension.\n\nMartin won the [[Jack Dyer Medal]] as Richmond's [[best and fairest]] player in 2016, along with his first [[All-Australian team|All-Australian]] selection. To date, Martin has won two [[List of VFL/AFL premiers|premiership]]s, two Jack Dyer Medals and three All-Australian selections among other individual accolades, and has also won several major best-on-ground awards. In both of his premiership years, he won both the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as best afield in the grand final (Martin is one of only four players to win the award twice) and the [[AFL Coaches Association awards#Gary Ayres Award|Gary Ayres Award]] as the player of the finals series.\n\nIn 2017, Martin had what was described by AFL legend [[Leigh Matthews]] as the greatest ever individual season by a VFL/AFL player. Despite constant speculation over his playing future, Martin won the league's highest individual honour, the [[Brownlow Medal]], with a record 36 votes, as well as a premiership and the Norm Smith Medal, becoming the first player to win all three in a single season. He also won numerous other accolades, including the [[Leigh Matthews Trophy]], the [[AFL Coaches Association awards#Champion Player of the Year Award|AFLCA Champion Player of the Year Award]] and his second Jack Dyer Medal.\n\n==Early life and junior football==\nMartin was born in [[Castlemaine, Victoria]], to a [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] father, Shane Martin, and an Australian mother, Kathy Knight.<ref name=\"born\">{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/tiger-tough/story-e6frf9jf-1225795211997 |work=Herald Sun |title=Dustin Martin's born to play AFL|last=Robinson|first=Mark |date=7 November 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"BenAdSep17\">{{cite news|last1=West|first1=Luke|title=Big AFL grand final day awaits Dustin Martin's family|url=http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/4956293/big-day-awaits-family/?cs=164|accessdate=13 January 2018|work=Bendigo Advertiser|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=29 September 2017}}</ref> His father has family connections to the [[Ng\u0101ti Maru (Hauraki)|Ng\u0101ti Maru]] tribe on [[New Zealand]]'s north island.<ref>{{cite news|last=Langmaid|first=Aaron|title=Dustin Martin and father go neck and neck in Maori stakes|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/afl/dustin-martin-and-father-go-neck-and-neck-in-maori-stakes/news-story/510ba152b3509822d639ba7cbc36b340|work=[[The Courier-Mail]]|date=30 June 2010|accessdate=1 October 2017}}</ref> Martin is one of three boys, alongside brothers Tyson and Bronson.<ref name=\"Y&B433\">{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=Konrad|title=Yellow & Black: A Season with Richmond|publisher=Slattery Media Group|location=Melbourne, Victoria, Australia|isbn=9780987342898|page=433}}</ref>\n\nMartin first took up football at age six, learning the sport with the local Auskick program.<ref name=\"Y&B433\"/> He would also play regularly with his brothers on their self-constructed field in one of the paddocks at his family's three acre home in [[Yapeen]].<ref name=\"BenAdSep17\"/> From there he played junior football for [[Campbells Creek, Victoria|Campbell's Creek]],  before spending time with the [[Bendigo Pioneers]] under 15 squad.<ref name=\"BenAdSep17\"/><ref name=\"EQdraft\">{{cite news|last1=Quayle|first1=Emma|title=Draft at the end of a footy dream|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/rfnews/draft-at-the-end-of-a-footy-dream/2009/11/10/1257615039723.html|accessdate=13 January 2018|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=11 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nHis parents separated when he was 14 and Martin moved to [[Sydney]] with his father, leaving school at Castlemaine High School after Year 9 and taking up full-time work.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dustin Martin: My Story So Far |date=2019 |publisher=Hardie Grant Books |location=Melbourne, Victoria |isbn=9781743795804 |page=31 |url=https://www.hardiegrant.com/au/publishing/bookfinder/book/dustin-martin-by-dustin-martin/9781743795804 |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"born\"/> He worked various roles at his father's transport business including as a forklift driver while also assisting his father's girlfriend's sports apparel business.<ref name=\"born\"/> In total he worked regular twelve hour days, later saying he hated \u201cworking long days\u201d in what was \u201cnot a very good job.\u201d<ref name=\"DailyTel11\">{{cite news|last1=Balym|first1=Todd|title=Taking correct turn at forklift in road|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/taking-correct-turn-at-forklift-in-road/news-story/ef3ad7c99276dd7f366238ecf4703233?sv=cffb8df1e8ead95c849876a595478573&nk=b6fb24ffb8b8fd2acacae06bc9e80b29-1515733459|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=Daily Telegraph|publisher=News Corp Australia|date=10 June 2011}}</ref>\nWhile in Sydney he continued to play football, starting off with the Ingleburn Magpies Junior Australian Football Club's under 16 side.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

The one electron reduction potentials of the nucleosides (in volts versus [[Standard hydrogen electrode#Relationship between the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) and the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)|NHE]]) are [[guanine]] 1.29, [[adenine]] 1.42, [[cytosine]] 1.6 and [[thymine]] 1.7.  About 1 in 40,000 guanines in the genome are present as 8-oxo-dG under normal conditions.  This means that >30,000 8-oxo-dGs may exist at any given time in the genome of a human cell.  Another product of DNA oxidation is 8-oxo-dA.  8-oxo-dA occurs at about 1/3 the frequency of 8-oxo-dG.

G:C to T:A [[transversion]]s occurred in 5.9% of the clones, single base [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]] in 2.1% and G:C to C:G transversions in 1.2%.  Together, these more common mutations totaled 9.2% of the 14% of mutations generated at the site of the 8-oxo-dG insertion.  Among the other mutations in the 800 clones analyzed, there were also 3 larger deletions, of sizes 6, 33 and 135 base pairs.

As noted by Wang et al.,<ref name=WangBoldogh /> genes prone to be actively transcribed are densely distributed in high GC-content regions of the genome.  They then described three modes of gene regulation by DNA oxidation at guanine.  In one mode, it appears that oxidative stress may produce 8-oxo-dG in a promoter of a gene.  The oxidative stress may also inactivate OGG1.  The inactive OGG1, which no longer excises 8-oxo-dG, nevertheless targets and complexes with 8-oxo-dG, and causes a sharp (~70<sup>o</sup>) bend in the DNA.  This allows the assembly of a transcriptional initiation complex, up-regulating transcription of the associated gene.

As noted by Wang et al.,<ref name=WangBoldogh /> genes prone to be actively transcribed are densely distributed in high GC-content regions of the genome.  They then described three modes of gene regulation by DNA oxidation at guanine.  In one mode, it appears that oxidative stress may produce 8-oxo-dG in a promoter of a gene.  The oxidative stress may also inactivate OGG1.  The inactive OGG1, which no longer excises 8-oxo-dG, nevertheless targets and complexes with 8-oxo-dG, and causes a sharp (~70<sup>o</sup>) bend in the DNA.  This allows the assembly of a transcriptional initiation complex, up-regulating transcription of the associated gene.  The experimental basis establishing this mode was also reviewed by Seifermann and Epe<ref name=Seifermann>{{cite journal |vauthors=Seifermann M, Epe B |title=Oxidatively generated base modifications in DNA: Not only carcinogenic risk factor but also regulatory mark? |journal=Free Radic.

The AP site enables melting of the duplex to unmask the PQS, adopting a [[G-quadruplex]] fold (G4 structure/motif) that has a regulatory role in transcription activation.\n\nA third mode of gene regulation by DNA oxidation at a guanine,<ref name=WangBoldogh /> occurs when 8-oxo-dG is complexed with OGG1 and then recruits [[chromatin remodeling|chromatin remodelers]] to modulate gene expression.  [[CHD4|Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4)]], a component of the [[Mi-2/NuRD complex|(NuRD)]] complex, is recruited by OGG1 to oxidative DNA damage sites.  CHD4 then attracts DNA and histone methylating enzymes that repress transcription of associated genes.\n\nSeifermann and Epe<ref name=Seifermann /> noted that the highly selective induction of 8-oxo-dG in the promoter sequences observed in transcription induction may be difficult to explain as a consequence of general oxidative stress.

In an alternative oxidative deamination pathway, 5hmC can be oxidatively deaminated by activity-induced cytidine deaminase/apolipoprotein B mRNA editing complex [[APOBEC3G|(AID/APOBEC)]] deaminases to form 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) or 5mC can be converted to [[thymine]] (Thy).  5hmU can be cleaved by TDG, single-strand-selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 ([[SMUG1]]), Nei-Like DNA Glycosylase 1 ([[NEIL1]]), or methyl-CpG binding protein 4 ([[MBD4]]).  AP sites and T:G mismatches are then repaired by base excision repair (BER) enzymes to yield [[cytosine]] (Cyt).]]\n\nThe first figure in this section shows a CpG site where the cytosine is methylated to form [[5-methylcytosine]] (5mC) and the guanine is oxidized to form [[8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine]] (in the figure this is shown in the tautomeric form 8-OHdG).  When this structure is formed, the [[base excision repair]] enzyme [[Oxoguanine glycosylase|OGG1]] targets 8-OHdG and binds to the lesion without immediate excision.  OGG1, present at a 5mCp-8-OHdG site recruits [[Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1|TET1]], and TET1 oxidizes the 5mC adjacent to the 8-OHdG.  This initiates de-methylation of 5mC.<ref name=\"pmid27251462\"/>  [[Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1|TET1]] is a key enzyme involved in de-methylating 5mCpG.  However, TET1 is only able to act on 5mCpG if the guanine was first oxidized to form [[8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine]] (8-OHdG or its tautomer 8-oxo-dG), resulting in a 5mCp-8-OHdG dinucleotide (see first figure in this section).<ref name=\"pmid27251462\"/>  This initiates the de-methylation pathway on the methylated cytosine, finally resulting in an unmethylated cytosine, shown in the second figure in this section.\n\nAltered protein expression in neurons, due to changes in methylation of DNA, (likely controlled by 8-oxo-dG-dependent de-methylation of CpG sites in gene promoters within neuron DNA) has been established as central to memory formation.<ref name=\"pmid20975755\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Day JJ, Sweatt JD |title=DNA methylation and memory formation |journal=Nat.

However, with the concern of various lengths of half lives of diverse RNA species ranging from several minutes to hours, degradation of defective RNA can not easily be attributed to its transient character anymore. Indeed, reaction with ROS takes only few minutes, which is even shorter than the average [[life-span]] of the most unstable RNAs.<ref name=\"Deleo, C.J. 2006\" />  Adding the fact that stable RNA take the lion\u2019s share of total RNA, RNA error deleting becomes hypercritical and should not be neglected anymore.

Forster and a number of other squatters conducted another reprisal, resulting in a large massacre of Aboriginals in scrubland toward the coastal part of Tirroan. A couple of years later, Forster sold the property and the name of the pastoral lease changed to Gin Gin. The area was gradually subdivided with the advance of closer settlement beginning in the 1860s.
