Tired of touring and being away from home for 8 months of the year, we wanted to shake things up. We thought it'd be fun to do a dbm sequel with Jonny and go out on that. We recorded dbm2 and felt it would be a disservice to our fans not to let them hear the new record live. We did a tour and felt rejuvenated but Jonny wasn't in a good place. After trying to convince him into getting help over warped tour, we canceled a headliner in November/December 2011 and told him we wouldn't tour until he sought out real help for his addiction. We got our good friend Matt Geise to fill in for a short run we did earlier this year while Jonny was in rehab. He was released and wanted to be out on the road immediately. We weren't sure how things would go so we only booked a small portion of the all stars tour to see if Jonny could still function as our lead singer. After a week and a half things were not going well. Everything came to a head when Jonny was publicly scolded by the owner of [[Sumerian Records]] for multiple offenses. It was then that we realized that our time with Jonny had reached its end. We wish Jonny the best In his future endeavors but he will no longer be a part of DGD.

In November 2007, singer Jonny Craig had left the group due to a heated argument between himself and the band's manager and when insisting on rejoining was denied due to tensions and personal conflicts within the band, mostly due to his lack of dependability and Craig's failure to be present during a portion of the band's set at Saints and Sinners Festival in [[New Jersey]] due to alcohol and drug related issues.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dance Gavin Dance - SubMerge Magazine|url=http://submergemag.com/featured/dance-gavin-dance/69|accessdate=August 23, 2010|date=April 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx|title=Dance Gavin Dance kicks out singer|website=Lambgoat.com}}</ref>\n\n===2008\u201309: ''Dance Gavin Dance'' and ''Happiness''===\n{{main|Dance Gavin Dance (album)|Happiness (Dance Gavin Dance album)}}\n<!--The album is self-titled.

Bassist Jason Ellis appears on ''Happiness'', however left the group before its release, subsequently being replaced by Tim Feerick as a touring member. ''AllMusic'' gave a mixed review of the album, writing, \"''Happiness'' bristles with the kind of overachiever eclecticism that's as impressive as it is divisive,\" but that two songs were marred by the \"nasally realm of high school emo,\" leaving the listener unsatisfied with the experience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Monger|first=James|title=allmusic ((( Happiness > Overview )))|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1566891|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[allmusic]]|accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref> A music video for the track \"Tree Village\" was released shortly after the album.

Tired of touring and being away from home for 8 months of the year, we wanted to shake things up. We thought it'd be fun to do a dbm sequel with Jonny and go out on that. We recorded dbm2 and felt it would be a disservice to our fans not to let them hear the new record live. We did a tour and felt rejuvenated but Jonny wasn't in a good place. After trying to convince him into getting help over warped tour, we canceled a headliner in November/December 2011 and told him we wouldn't tour until he sought out real help for his addiction. We got our good friend Matt Geise to fill in for a short run we did earlier this year while Jonny was in rehab. He was released and wanted to be out on the road immediately. We weren't sure how things would go so we only booked a small portion of the all stars tour to see if Jonny could still function as our lead singer. After a week and a half things were not going well. Everything came to a head when Jonny was publicly scolded by the owner of [[Sumerian Records]] for multiple offenses. It was then that we realized that our time with Jonny had reached its end. We wish Jonny the best In his future endeavors but he will no longer be a part of DGD. We however will continue playing and writing music because it's what we love doing.\"}}\n\n[[Tilian Pearson]], formerly of [[Tides of Man]], was asked to replace Craig as clean vocalist during the making of his solo album, ''Material Me'' (2013).

They form the family '''Furnariidae'''. The [[ovenbird]] (''Seiurus aurocapilla''), which breeds in [[North America]], is not a furnariid \u2013 rather it is a distantly related bird of the [[New World warbler|wood warbler]] family, Parulidae.\n\nThe ovenbirds are a diverse group of [[insectivore]]s which get their name from the elaborate, vaguely \"oven-like\" clay nests built by the [[hornero]]s, although most other ovenbirds build stick nests or nest in tunnels or clefts in rock.<ref name=Remsen2003>Remsen, J. V., Jr. 2003. Family Furnariidae (ovenbirds). Pages 162\u2013357 in J. del Hoyo, A. Elliott and D. A. Christie eds. Handbook of the birds of the world, Vol. 8, broadbills to tapaculos. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona.</ref> The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for \"oven\" ''(horno)'' gives the horneros their name. Furnariid nests are always constructed with a cover, and up to six pale blue, greenish or white [[egg (biology)|eggs]] are laid. The eggs hatch after  15 to 22 days, and the young fledge after a further 13 to 20 days.<ref name=EoB>{{cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Willis, Edwin O.|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|location=London|pages= 162\u2013163|isbn= 978-1-85391-186-6}}</ref>\n\nThey are small to medium-sized birds, ranging from 9 to 35&nbsp;cm in length.<ref name=EoB/> While individual species often are habitat specialists, species of this family can be found in virtually any [[Neotropical]] habitat, ranging from city parks inhabited by [[rufous hornero]]s, to tropical [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian]] lowlands by many species of foliage-gleaners, to temperate barren [[Andean]] highlands inhabited by several species of [[Geositta|miners]]. Two species, the [[Chilean seaside cinclodes|seaside]] and the [[surf cinclodes]], are associated with rocky coasts.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\nRecently, the [[woodcreeper]]s (formerly Dendrocolaptidae) were merged into this family, following analysis of [[DNA sequence|sequences]].<ref name=Irestedt2002/> While confirming the overall [[phylogenetic]] pattern, other scientists instead opted for maintaining the woodcreepers as a separate family, while splitting the ovenbirds (as traditionally defined) into two families, Furnariidae and Scleruridae.<ref name=Moyle/>\n\nThe systematics of the Dendrocolaptinae were reviewed by Raikow (1994)<ref name=Raikow/> based on morphology and by Irestedt ''et al.'' (2004)<ref name=Irestedt2004/> based on analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Using the latter approach, the suspected major lineages of the Furnariinae (foliage-gleaners, spinetails, and true ovenbirds) were confirmed, but some new lineages were discovered and the relationships of several genera had to be revised.<ref name=Fjeldsa/><ref name=\"DerryberryClaramunt2011\">{{cite journal|last1=Derryberry|first1=Elizabeth P.|last2=Claramunt|first2=Santiago|last3=Derryberry|first3=Graham|last4=Chesser|first4=R.

They form the family '''Furnariidae'''. The [[ovenbird]] (''Seiurus aurocapilla''), which breeds in [[North America]], is not a furnariid \u2013 rather it is a distantly related bird of the [[New World warbler|wood warbler]] family, Parulidae.\n\nThe ovenbirds are a diverse group of [[insectivore]]s which get their name from the elaborate, vaguely \"oven-like\" clay nests built by the [[hornero]]s, although most other ovenbirds build stick nests or nest in tunnels or clefts in rock.<ref name=Remsen2003>Remsen, J. V., Jr. 2003. Family Furnariidae (ovenbirds). Pages 162\u2013357 in J. del Hoyo, A. Elliott and D. A. Christie eds. Handbook of the birds of the world, Vol. 8, broadbills to tapaculos. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona.</ref> The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for \"oven\" ''(horno)'' gives the horneros their name. Furnariid nests are always constructed with a cover, and up to six pale blue, greenish or white [[egg (biology)|eggs]] are laid. The eggs hatch after  15 to 22 days, and the young fledge after a further 13 to 20 days.<ref name=EoB>{{cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Willis, Edwin O.|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|location=London|pages= 162\u2013163|isbn= 978-1-85391-186-6}}</ref>\n\nThey are small to medium-sized birds, ranging from 9 to 35&nbsp;cm in length.<ref name=EoB/> While individual species often are habitat specialists, species of this family can be found in virtually any [[Neotropical]] habitat, ranging from city parks inhabited by [[rufous hornero]]s, to tropical [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian]] lowlands by many species of foliage-gleaners, to temperate barren [[Andean]] highlands inhabited by several species of [[Geositta|miners]]. Two species, the [[Chilean seaside cinclodes|seaside]] and the [[surf cinclodes]], are associated with rocky coasts.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\nRecently, the [[woodcreeper]]s (formerly Dendrocolaptidae) were merged into this family, following analysis of [[DNA sequence|sequences]].<ref name=Irestedt2002/> While confirming the overall [[phylogenetic]] pattern, other scientists instead opted for maintaining the woodcreepers as a separate family, while splitting the ovenbirds (as traditionally defined) into two families, Furnariidae and Scleruridae.<ref name=Moyle/>\n\nThe systematics of the Dendrocolaptinae were reviewed by Raikow (1994)<ref name=Raikow/> based on morphology and by Irestedt ''et al.'' (2004)<ref name=Irestedt2004/> based on analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Using the latter approach, the suspected major lineages of the Furnariinae (foliage-gleaners, spinetails, and true ovenbirds) were confirmed, but some new lineages were discovered and the relationships of several genera had to be revised.<ref name=Fjeldsa/><ref name=\"DerryberryClaramunt2011\">{{cite journal|last1=Derryberry|first1=Elizabeth P.|last2=Claramunt|first2=Santiago|last3=Derryberry|first3=Graham|last4=Chesser|first4=R.

The English physician [[Thomas Browne]] in his ''[[A Letter to a Friend]]'' ({{circa|1656}} pub. 1690) made an early dental observation with characteristic humour:\n\n{{Quote|quote=The Egyptian Mummies that I have seen, have had their Mouths open, and somewhat gaping, which affordeth a good opportunity to view and observe their Teeth, wherein 'tis not easie to find any wanting or decayed: and therefore in Egypt, where one Man practised but one Operation, or the Diseases but of single Parts, it must needs be a barren Profession to confine unto that of drawing of Teeth, and little better than to have been Tooth-drawer unto King Pyrrhus, who had but two in his Head.}}\n\nThe French surgeon [[Pierre Fauchard]] became known as the \"father of modern dentistry\". Despite the limitations of the primitive surgical instruments during the late 17th and early 18th century, Fauchard was a highly skilled [[surgeon]] who made remarkable improvisations of dental instruments, often adapting tools from [[watchmaker]]s, [[jeweler]]s and even [[barber]]s, that he thought could be used in dentistry. He introduced [[dental filling]]s as treatment for [[dental cavities]]. He asserted that [[sugar]] derivate acids like [[tartaric acid]] were responsible for [[caries|dental decay]], and also suggested that tumors surrounding the teeth and in the [[Gingiva|gums]] could appear in the later stages of tooth decay.<ref name=\"Besombes\">{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2RRqAAAAMAAJ |title = Pierre Fauchard (1678\u20131761): The First Dental Surgeon, His Work, His Actuality |author = Andr\u00e9 Besombes |author2 = Phillipe de Gaillande |publisher = Pierre Fauchard Academy |date = 1993 }}</ref><ref name=\"Weinberger\">{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2wtqAAAAMAAJ |title = Pierre Fauchard, Surgeon-dentist: A Brief Account of the Beginning of Modern Dentistry, the First Dental Textbook, and Professional Life Two Hundred Years Ago |author = Bernhard Wolf Weinberger |date = 1941 |publisher = Pierre Fauchard Academy }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Panoramic radiograph of historic dental implants.jpg|thumb|Panoramic radiograph of historic dental implants, made 1978]]\n\nFauchard was the pioneer of [[Prosthodontics|dental prosthesis]], and he discovered many methods to replace lost teeth. He suggested that substitutes could be made from carved blocks of [[ivory]] or [[bone]]. He also introduced [[dental braces]], although they were initially made of gold, he discovered that the teeth position could be corrected as the teeth would follow the pattern of the wires. Waxed [[linen]] or [[silk]] threads were usually employed to fasten the braces. His contributions to the world of dental science consist primarily of his 1728 publication Le chirurgien dentiste or The Surgeon Dentist.  The French text included \"basic oral anatomy and function, dental construction, and various operative and restorative techniques, and effectively separated dentistry from the wider category of surgery\".<ref name=\"Besombes\" /><ref name=\"Weinberger\" />\n\n[[File:Dental office.jpg|thumb|left|A modern dentist's chair]]\n\nAfter Fauchard, the study of dentistry rapidly expanded. Two important books, ''Natural History of Human Teeth'' (1771) and ''Practical Treatise on the Diseases of the Teeth'' (1778), were published by British surgeon [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]]. In 1763 he entered into a period of collaboration with the London-based dentist James Spence. He began to theorise about the possibility of [[tooth transplant]]s from one person to another. He realised that the chances of an (initially, at least) successful tooth transplant would be improved if the donor tooth was as fresh as possible and was matched for size with the recipient.  These principles are still used in the transplantation of [[internal organ]]s. Hunter conducted a series of pioneering operations, in which he attempted a tooth transplant. Although the donated teeth never properly bonded with the recipients' gums, one of Hunter's patients stated that he had three which lasted for six years, a remarkable achievement for the period.<ref>{{cite book |author = Moore, Wendy |authorlink = Wendy Moore |title = The Knife Man |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DKInoTPFrBoC |accessdate = 8 March 2012 |date = 30 September 2010 |publisher = Transworld |pages = 223\u201324 |isbn = 978-1-4090-4462-8 }}</ref>\n\nMajor advances were made in the 19th century, and dentistry evolved from a trade to a profession. The profession came under government regulation by the end of the 19th century. In the UK the Dentist Act was passed in 1878 and the British Dental Association formed in 1879. In the same year, [[Francis Brodie Imlach]] was the first ever dentist to be elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh), raising dentistry onto a par with clinical surgery for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://historyofdentistry.co.uk/index_htm_files/2004Apr2.pdf |title=A pioneering history: dentistry and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh |first=Helen |last=Dingwall |date=April 2004 |work=History of Dentistry Newsletter |issue=14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201191323/http://historyofdentistry.co.uk/index_htm_files/2004Apr2.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Hazards in modern dentistry===\n{{main|Occupational hazards in dentistry}}\nLong term occupational noise exposure can contribute to permanent hearing loss, which is referred to as [[noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL) and [[tinnitus]].

The English physician [[Thomas Browne]] in his ''[[A Letter to a Friend]]'' ({{circa|1656}} pub. 1690) made an early dental observation with characteristic humour:\n\n{{Quote|quote=The Egyptian Mummies that I have seen, have had their Mouths open, and somewhat gaping, which affordeth a good opportunity to view and observe their Teeth, wherein 'tis not easie to find any wanting or decayed: and therefore in Egypt, where one Man practised but one Operation, or the Diseases but of single Parts, it must needs be a barren Profession to confine unto that of drawing of Teeth, and little better than to have been Tooth-drawer unto King Pyrrhus, who had but two in his Head.}}\n\nThe French surgeon [[Pierre Fauchard]] became known as the \"father of modern dentistry\". Despite the limitations of the primitive surgical instruments during the late 17th and early 18th century, Fauchard was a highly skilled [[surgeon]] who made remarkable improvisations of dental instruments, often adapting tools from [[watchmaker]]s, [[jeweler]]s and even [[barber]]s, that he thought could be used in dentistry. He introduced [[dental filling]]s as treatment for [[dental cavities]]. He asserted that [[sugar]] derivate acids like [[tartaric acid]] were responsible for [[caries|dental decay]], and also suggested that tumors surrounding the teeth and in the [[Gingiva|gums]] could appear in the later stages of tooth decay.<ref name=\"Besombes\">{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2RRqAAAAMAAJ |title = Pierre Fauchard (1678\u20131761): The First Dental Surgeon, His Work, His Actuality |author = Andr\u00e9 Besombes |author2 = Phillipe de Gaillande |publisher = Pierre Fauchard Academy |date = 1993 }}</ref><ref name=\"Weinberger\">{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2wtqAAAAMAAJ |title = Pierre Fauchard, Surgeon-dentist: A Brief Account of the Beginning of Modern Dentistry, the First Dental Textbook, and Professional Life Two Hundred Years Ago |author = Bernhard Wolf Weinberger |date = 1941 |publisher = Pierre Fauchard Academy }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Panoramic radiograph of historic dental implants.jpg|thumb|Panoramic radiograph of historic dental implants, made 1978]]\n\nFauchard was the pioneer of [[Prosthodontics|dental prosthesis]], and he discovered many methods to replace lost teeth. He suggested that substitutes could be made from carved blocks of [[ivory]] or [[bone]]. He also introduced [[dental braces]], although they were initially made of gold, he discovered that the teeth position could be corrected as the teeth would follow the pattern of the wires. Waxed [[linen]] or [[silk]] threads were usually employed to fasten the braces. His contributions to the world of dental science consist primarily of his 1728 publication Le chirurgien dentiste or The Surgeon Dentist.  The French text included \"basic oral anatomy and function, dental construction, and various operative and restorative techniques, and effectively separated dentistry from the wider category of surgery\".<ref name=\"Besombes\" /><ref name=\"Weinberger\" />\n\n[[File:Dental office.jpg|thumb|left|A modern dentist's chair]]\n\nAfter Fauchard, the study of dentistry rapidly expanded. Two important books, ''Natural History of Human Teeth'' (1771) and ''Practical Treatise on the Diseases of the Teeth'' (1778), were published by British surgeon [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]]. In 1763 he entered into a period of collaboration with the London-based dentist James Spence. He began to theorise about the possibility of [[tooth transplant]]s from one person to another. He realised that the chances of an (initially, at least) successful tooth transplant would be improved if the donor tooth was as fresh as possible and was matched for size with the recipient.  These principles are still used in the transplantation of [[internal organ]]s. Hunter conducted a series of pioneering operations, in which he attempted a tooth transplant. Although the donated teeth never properly bonded with the recipients' gums, one of Hunter's patients stated that he had three which lasted for six years, a remarkable achievement for the period.<ref>{{cite book |author = Moore, Wendy |authorlink = Wendy Moore |title = The Knife Man |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DKInoTPFrBoC |accessdate = 8 March 2012 |date = 30 September 2010 |publisher = Transworld |pages = 223\u201324 |isbn = 978-1-4090-4462-8 }}</ref>\n\nMajor advances were made in the 19th century, and dentistry evolved from a trade to a profession. The profession came under government regulation by the end of the 19th century. In the UK the Dentist Act was passed in 1878 and the British Dental Association formed in 1879. In the same year, [[Francis Brodie Imlach]] was the first ever dentist to be elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh), raising dentistry onto a par with clinical surgery for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://historyofdentistry.co.uk/index_htm_files/2004Apr2.pdf |title=A pioneering history: dentistry and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh |first=Helen |last=Dingwall |date=April 2004 |work=History of Dentistry Newsletter |issue=14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201191323/http://historyofdentistry.co.uk/index_htm_files/2004Apr2.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Hazards in modern dentistry===\n{{main|Occupational hazards in dentistry}}\nLong term occupational noise exposure can contribute to permanent hearing loss, which is referred to as [[noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL) and [[tinnitus]].

Exposures below 85 dBA are not considered to be hazardous. Time limits are placed on how long an individual can stay in an environment above 85 dBA before it causes hearing loss. OSHA places that limitation at 8 hours for 85 dBA.

[[Evidence-based dentistry]] (EBD) uses current scientific evidence to guide decisions. It is an approach to oral health that requires the application and examination of relevant scientific data related to the patient's oral and medical health. Along with the dentist's professional skill and expertise, EBD allows dentists to stay up to date on the latest procedures and patients to receive improved treatment. A new paradigm for medical education designed to incorporate current research into education and practice was developed to help practitioners provide the best care for their patients.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Evidence-based medicine.

That window was executed by Pompeo Bertini, stained-glass artist for the [[Milan Cathedral|Cathedral of Milan, Italy]], and is dedicated to Clark's daughter Jessie, who died three weeks before her third birthday in 1878. The restoration of the window was paid for by Clark's son [[William Andrews Clark, Jr.|William A., Jr.]], and Jessie's twin sister, Catherine. Additional expansions have included enlarging the chancel and adding the chapel in 1936.

In the 14th century, the town was the property of the [[Hrvatini\u0107 noble family]].\n\n[[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] began in 1878 and ended with the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918, later renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The town was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] (1929\u201341), while after [[World War II]] it became part of the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a republic of [[Yugoslavia]].\n\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]] (1992\u201395), some religious and cultural monuments and landmarks were destroyed by Serb paramilitary groups, such as a Catholic church in the centre of the town, as well as all of the mosques. In the southern ''\u010car\u0161ija'' ([[bazaar]]) quarter of the town nearly all houses were destroyed. [[Bosnian Serb]]-dominated parts of the town were largely unaffected. Bosnian Serb police and military forces devastated surrounding villages too, especially those upstream along the Vrbanja to [[Kru\u0161evo Brdo]], as well as all non-Serb villages downstream to [[Banja Luka]]. All settlements in the Vrbanja valley were sacked and much of the Bosniak and Croat population left the municipality.<ref>{{cite web|title=KOTOR VARO\u0160: ZLO\u010cIN PO ZLO\u010cIN \u2013 GENOCID|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/tribunal_%28mksj%29/kotor-varos-zlocin-po-zlocin-%E2%80%93-genocid.25.html?news_id=16169}}</ref><ref>Tribunal international charg\u00e9 de poursuivre les personnes pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es responsables de violations graves du droit international humanitaire commises sur le territoire de l\u2019ex-Yougoslavie depuis 1991, Jugement rendu le: 27 septembre 2006: LE PROCUREUR c/ MOM\u010cILO KRAJI\u0160NIK.</ref>\n\n==Settlements==\nAside from the town of Kotor Varo\u0161, the municipality includes the following settlements:\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Ba\u0161tina, Kotor Varo\u0161|Ba\u0161tina]]\n* [[Bilice, Kotor Varo\u0161|Bilice]]\n* [[Boljani\u0107i, Kotor Varo\u0161|Boljani\u0107i]]\n* [[Borci Donji]]\n* [[Borci Gornji]]\n* [[\u0106orkovi\u0107i, Kotor Varo\u0161|\u0106orkovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Duratovci]]\n* [[Gari\u0107i, Kotor Varo\u0161|Gari\u0107i]]\n* [[Grabovica, Kotor Varo\u0161|Grabovica]]\n* [[Hadrovci, Kotor Varo\u0161|Hadrovci]]\n* [[Hrva\u0107ani, Kotor Varo\u0161|Hrva\u0107ani]]\n* [[Hanifi\u0107i]]\n* [[Jakotina]]\n* [[Kru\u0161evo Brdo]]\n* [[Liplje (Kotor Varo\u0161)|Liplje]]\n* [[Maljeva]]\n* [[Maslovare, Kotor Varo\u0161|Maslovare]]\n* [[Obodnik]]\n* [[Orahova, Kotor Varo\u0161|Orahova]]\n* [[Palivuk]]\n* [[Plitska]]\n* [[Podbr\u0111e, Kotor Varo\u0161|Podbr\u0111e]]\n* [[Podosoje, Kotor Varo\u0161|Podosoje]]\n* [[Postoje]]\n* [[Priso\u010dka]]\n* [[Radohova]]\n* [[Ravne, Kotor Varo\u0161|Ravne]]\n* [[Sela\u010dka, Kotor Varo\u0161|Sela\u010dka]]\n* [[Sokoline]]\n* [[Stopan]]\n* [[\u0160ibovi, Kotor Varo\u0161|\u0160ibovi]]\n* [[\u0160iprage]]\n* [[Tovladi\u0107]]\n* [[Vagani]]\n* [[Varja\u010de]]\n* [[Ve\u010di\u0107i]]\n* [[Vi\u0161evice]]\n* [[Vrani\u0107, Kotor Varo\u0161|Vrani\u0107]]\n* [[Vrbanjci]]\n* [[Zabr\u0111e, Kotor Varo\u0161|Zabr\u0111e]]\n* [[Zaselje, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Zaselje]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In the 14th century, the town was the property of the [[Hrvatini\u0107 noble family]].\n\n[[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] began in 1878 and ended with the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918, later renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The town was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] (1929\u201341), while after [[World War II]] it became part of the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a republic of [[Yugoslavia]].\n\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]] (1992\u201395), some religious and cultural monuments and landmarks were destroyed by Serb paramilitary groups, such as a Catholic church in the centre of the town, as well as all of the mosques. In the southern ''\u010car\u0161ija'' ([[bazaar]]) quarter of the town nearly all houses were destroyed. [[Bosnian Serb]]-dominated parts of the town were largely unaffected. Bosnian Serb police and military forces devastated surrounding villages too, especially those upstream along the Vrbanja to [[Kru\u0161evo Brdo]], as well as all non-Serb villages downstream to [[Banja Luka]]. All settlements in the Vrbanja valley were sacked and much of the Bosniak and Croat population left the municipality.<ref>{{cite web|title=KOTOR VARO\u0160: ZLO\u010cIN PO ZLO\u010cIN \u2013 GENOCID|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/tribunal_%28mksj%29/kotor-varos-zlocin-po-zlocin-%E2%80%93-genocid.25.html?news_id=16169}}</ref><ref>Tribunal international charg\u00e9 de poursuivre les personnes pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es responsables de violations graves du droit international humanitaire commises sur le territoire de l\u2019ex-Yougoslavie depuis 1991, Jugement rendu le: 27 septembre 2006: LE PROCUREUR c/ MOM\u010cILO KRAJI\u0160NIK.</ref>\n\n==Settlements==\nAside from the town of Kotor Varo\u0161, the municipality includes the following settlements:\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Ba\u0161tina, Kotor Varo\u0161|Ba\u0161tina]]\n* [[Bilice, Kotor Varo\u0161|Bilice]]\n* [[Boljani\u0107i, Kotor Varo\u0161|Boljani\u0107i]]\n* [[Borci Donji]]\n* [[Borci Gornji]]\n* [[\u0106orkovi\u0107i, Kotor Varo\u0161|\u0106orkovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Duratovci]]\n* [[Gari\u0107i, Kotor Varo\u0161|Gari\u0107i]]\n* [[Grabovica, Kotor Varo\u0161|Grabovica]]\n* [[Hadrovci, Kotor Varo\u0161|Hadrovci]]\n* [[Hrva\u0107ani, Kotor Varo\u0161|Hrva\u0107ani]]\n* [[Hanifi\u0107i]]\n* [[Jakotina]]\n* [[Kru\u0161evo Brdo]]\n* [[Liplje (Kotor Varo\u0161)|Liplje]]\n* [[Maljeva]]\n* [[Maslovare, Kotor Varo\u0161|Maslovare]]\n* [[Obodnik]]\n* [[Orahova, Kotor Varo\u0161|Orahova]]\n* [[Palivuk]]\n* [[Plitska]]\n* [[Podbr\u0111e, Kotor Varo\u0161|Podbr\u0111e]]\n* [[Podosoje, Kotor Varo\u0161|Podosoje]]\n* [[Postoje]]\n* [[Priso\u010dka]]\n* [[Radohova]]\n* [[Ravne, Kotor Varo\u0161|Ravne]]\n* [[Sela\u010dka, Kotor Varo\u0161|Sela\u010dka]]\n* [[Sokoline]]\n* [[Stopan]]\n* [[\u0160ibovi, Kotor Varo\u0161|\u0160ibovi]]\n* [[\u0160iprage]]\n* [[Tovladi\u0107]]\n* [[Vagani]]\n* [[Varja\u010de]]\n* [[Ve\u010di\u0107i]]\n* [[Vi\u0161evice]]\n* [[Vrani\u0107, Kotor Varo\u0161|Vrani\u0107]]\n* [[Vrbanjci]]\n* [[Zabr\u0111e, Kotor Varo\u0161|Zabr\u0111e]]\n* [[Zaselje, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Zaselje]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The [[monomer]]s may appear in homopolymeric blocks of consecutive [[G-residues]] (G-blocks), consecutive [[M-residues]] (M-blocks) or alternating M and G-residues (MG-blocks).\n\n==Forms==\nAlginates are refined from brown [[seaweeds]]. A wide variety of brown seaweeds of the class [[Phaeophyceae ]] are harvested throughout the world to be converted into the raw material commonly known as sodium alginate. Sodium alginate has a wide use across a wide variety of industries including food, textile printing, and pharmaceutical. Dental impression material uses alginate as its means of gelling. Alginate is safe as an ingredient in manufactured foods.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alginates|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Alginates%20TR%202015.pdf|publisher=Agricultural Marketing Service, US Department of Agriculture|accessdate=1 March 2018|date=5 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSeaweeds may be classified into three broad groups based on pigmentation: brown, red, and green. These broad groups are the [[Phaeophyceae]], [[Rhodophyceae]], and [[Chlorophyceae]], respectively. Brown seaweeds usually are large, and range from the giant kelp ''[[Macrocystis pyrifera]]'' that is often 20 m long, to thick, leather-like seaweeds from 2\u20134 m long, to smaller species 30\u201360&nbsp;cm long. None of the usual seaweeds for alginate production are cultivated. They cannot be grown by vegetative means, but must go through a reproductive cycle involving an alternation of generations. This makes cultivated brown seaweeds too expensive when compared to the costs of harvesting and transporting wild seaweeds. The only exception is for ''[[Laminaria japonica]]'', which is cultivated in China for food and its surplus material is diverted to the alginate industry in China.\n\nAlginates from different species of brown seaweed often have variations in their chemical structure, resulting in different physical properties. For example, some may yield an alginate that gives a strong gel, another a weaker gel, some may readily give a cream or white alginate, while others are difficult to gel and are best used for technical applications where color does not matter.<ref>FAO FISHERIES TECHNICAL PAPER 441, Tevita Bainiloga Jnr, School of Chemistry, University College, University of New South Wales and Australian Defence Force Academy Canberra Australia</ref>\n\nCommercial varieties of alginate are extracted from seaweed, including the giant [[kelp]] ''[[Macrocystis pyrifera]]'', ''[[Ascophyllum nodosum]]'', and various types of ''[[Laminaria]]''. It also is produced by two [[bacteria]]l [[genera]] ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' and ''[[Azotobacter]]'', which played a major role in the unravelling of its [[biosynthesis]] pathway. Bacterial alginates are useful for the production of micro- or nanostructures suitable for medical applications.<ref name=2Remminghorst>{{cite book |author=Remminghorst and Rehm|year=2009|chapter=Microbial Production of Alginate: Biosynthesis and Applications|title=Microbial Production of Biopolymers and Polymer Precursors|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn = 978-1-904455-36-3}}</ref>\n\nSodium alginate is the [[Sodium salts|sodium salt]] of alginic acid. Its [[empirical formula]] is NaC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. Sodium alginate is a gum, extracted from the cell walls of [[brown algae]].\n\nPotassium alginate is a chemical compound that is the potassium [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of alginic acid. It is an extract of seaweed. Its empirical chemical formula is KC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.\n\n[[Calcium alginate]], made from sodium alginate from which the sodium ion has been removed and replaced with calcium, has the chemical formula C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>14</sub>CaO<sub>12</sub>.\n\n==Production==\nThe processes for the manufacture of sodium alginate from brown seaweeds fall into two categories: 1) [[Calcium alginate]] method and, 2) Alginic acid method. The chemistry of the processes used to extract sodium alginate from brown seaweeds is relatively simple. The difficulties of the processes arise from the physical separations that are required, such as the need to filter slimy residues from viscous solutions or to separate gelatinous precipitates that hold large amounts of liquid within the structure and thereby resist [[filtration]] and [[centrifugation]].<ref>FAO Fisheries Technical Paper, 2003</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}\n\nAlginate absorbs water quickly, which makes it useful as an additive in [[dehydrated]] products such as [[diet aid|slimming aids]], and in the manufacture of paper and textiles.

The [[monomer]]s may appear in homopolymeric blocks of consecutive [[G-residues]] (G-blocks), consecutive [[M-residues]] (M-blocks) or alternating M and G-residues (MG-blocks).\n\n==Forms==\nAlginates are refined from brown [[seaweeds]]. A wide variety of brown seaweeds of the class [[Phaeophyceae ]] are harvested throughout the world to be converted into the raw material commonly known as sodium alginate. Sodium alginate has a wide use across a wide variety of industries including food, textile printing, and pharmaceutical. Dental impression material uses alginate as its means of gelling. Alginate is safe as an ingredient in manufactured foods.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alginates|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Alginates%20TR%202015.pdf|publisher=Agricultural Marketing Service, US Department of Agriculture|accessdate=1 March 2018|date=5 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSeaweeds may be classified into three broad groups based on pigmentation: brown, red, and green. These broad groups are the [[Phaeophyceae]], [[Rhodophyceae]], and [[Chlorophyceae]], respectively. Brown seaweeds usually are large, and range from the giant kelp ''[[Macrocystis pyrifera]]'' that is often 20 m long, to thick, leather-like seaweeds from 2\u20134 m long, to smaller species 30\u201360&nbsp;cm long. None of the usual seaweeds for alginate production are cultivated. They cannot be grown by vegetative means, but must go through a reproductive cycle involving an alternation of generations. This makes cultivated brown seaweeds too expensive when compared to the costs of harvesting and transporting wild seaweeds. The only exception is for ''[[Laminaria japonica]]'', which is cultivated in China for food and its surplus material is diverted to the alginate industry in China.\n\nAlginates from different species of brown seaweed often have variations in their chemical structure, resulting in different physical properties. For example, some may yield an alginate that gives a strong gel, another a weaker gel, some may readily give a cream or white alginate, while others are difficult to gel and are best used for technical applications where color does not matter.<ref>FAO FISHERIES TECHNICAL PAPER 441, Tevita Bainiloga Jnr, School of Chemistry, University College, University of New South Wales and Australian Defence Force Academy Canberra Australia</ref>\n\nCommercial varieties of alginate are extracted from seaweed, including the giant [[kelp]] ''[[Macrocystis pyrifera]]'', ''[[Ascophyllum nodosum]]'', and various types of ''[[Laminaria]]''.

The chemistry of the processes used to extract sodium alginate from brown seaweeds is relatively simple. The difficulties of the processes arise from the physical separations that are required, such as the need to filter slimy residues from viscous solutions or to separate gelatinous precipitates that hold large amounts of liquid within the structure and thereby resist [[filtration]] and [[centrifugation]].<ref>FAO Fisheries Technical Paper, 2003</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}\n\nAlginate absorbs water quickly, which makes it useful as an additive in [[dehydrated]] products such as [[diet aid|slimming aids]], and in the manufacture of paper and textiles.

The Cunard Building was designed in the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] style by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]], in conjunction with consultants [[Carr\u00e8re & Hastings]].\n\nThe Cunard Building's main facade, on Broadway, is made of limestone and consists of three horizontal sections. The design employs [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] and open \"light courts\" as mandated by the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]]. The structure was designed around an irregular street grid and is located directly above a [[New York City Subway|subway]] line that crosses the building site diagonally. The first floor interior contains an elaborately decorated lobby, as well as a similarly opulent Great Hall, which extends {{Convert|185|ft||abbr=}} with a {{Convert|65|ft|m|abbr=|-tall|adj=mid}} dome. The remaining floors contain various offices and school spaces.\n\nThe Cunard Building was erected for the New York City office of the [[Cunard Line]], a British-American steamship line; construction started in 1920 and the building was completed the next year. Upon completion, the Cunard Building was almost fully leased to tenants of various industries. The Twenty-five Broadway Corporation, a Cunard Line affiliate, owned the building until the 1960s. The Great Hall was vacated after the Cunard Line moved out in 1968; the [[United States Postal Service]] occupied the Great Hall from 1974 until 2000, and [[Cipriani S.A.]] started using the space in 2014. The upper floors continued to host offices and various educational facilities.\n\nUpon completion, the Cunard Building's exterior and interior designs received critical acclaim. The Cunard Building's facade and principal first-floor interior spaces were designated as [[List of New York City Landmarks|landmarks]] by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1995.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Cunard Building is a 22-story building,<ref name=\"emporis\" /> bounded by the [[Bowling Green Offices Building]] (11 Broadway) to the south, Broadway to the east, [[Greenwich Street]] to the west, and Morris Street to the north.<ref name=\"NYT-Cunard-1919\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1918/02/20/archives/cunard-to-have-big-building-here-10000000-structure-of-26-stories.html|title=Cunard To Have Big Building Here; $10,000,000 Structure of 26 Stories Going Up on Site of Old Stevens House.|last=|first=|date=February 20, 1918|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 28, 2020|url-status=live|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=\"Tribune-Cunard-1919\" /> It is located across from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green Park]] to the southeast, and [[26 Broadway]] and the ''[[Charging Bull]]'' sculpture to the east.<ref name=\"lpc95\" /> While 25 Broadway is considered to be its primary address, it is also known as 13\u201327 Broadway, 13\u201339 Greenwich Street, and 1\u20139 Morris Street.<ref name=\"emporis\">{{cite web |url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115358/standard-poors-building-new-york-city-ny-usa |title=Standard & Poors Building |website=Emporis |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"lpc95\" /> The Cunard Building has a [[frontage]] of {{Convert|203|ft||abbr=}} along Broadway, {{Convert|231|ft||abbr=}} along Greenwich Street, and {{Convert|248|ft||abbr=}} along Morris Street.<ref name=\"AB p. 61\">{{harvnb|''Architecture and Building''|1921|ps=.|p=61}}</ref> Due to the irregular street grid of the area, none of its corners are at right angles.<ref name=\"AR-Cunard-1919\">{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 1919|title=The Cunard Building, New York|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2640733&view=1up&seq=260|journal=Architectural Review|volume=26|pages=113\u2013114|via=}}</ref><ref name=\"Tribune-Completed-1921\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43286591/|title=$20,000,000 Office Building Projects of Cunard and Munson Lines Completed|date=May 1, 1921|work=New-York Tribune|access-date=January 30, 2020|page=37|via=newspapers.com {{open access}}}}</ref>\n\nThe Cunard Building was largely designed by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]].<ref name=\"NYT-Cunard-1919\" /> The [[massing]] and [[facade]] were devised by [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings]], while exterior detail was created by Rochette & Parzini.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 5\">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1995|ps=.|p=5}}</ref> The structure was laid out so that ancillary structures such as smoke stacks, penthouses, and storage tanks could not be seen from the side.

The Cunard Building was designed in the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] style by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]], in conjunction with consultants [[Carr\u00e8re & Hastings]].\n\nThe Cunard Building's main facade, on Broadway, is made of limestone and consists of three horizontal sections. The design employs [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] and open \"light courts\" as mandated by the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]]. The structure was designed around an irregular street grid and is located directly above a [[New York City Subway|subway]] line that crosses the building site diagonally. The first floor interior contains an elaborately decorated lobby, as well as a similarly opulent Great Hall, which extends {{Convert|185|ft||abbr=}} with a {{Convert|65|ft|m|abbr=|-tall|adj=mid}} dome. The remaining floors contain various offices and school spaces.\n\nThe Cunard Building was erected for the New York City office of the [[Cunard Line]], a British-American steamship line; construction started in 1920 and the building was completed the next year. Upon completion, the Cunard Building was almost fully leased to tenants of various industries. The Twenty-five Broadway Corporation, a Cunard Line affiliate, owned the building until the 1960s. The Great Hall was vacated after the Cunard Line moved out in 1968; the [[United States Postal Service]] occupied the Great Hall from 1974 until 2000, and [[Cipriani S.A.]] started using the space in 2014. The upper floors continued to host offices and various educational facilities.\n\nUpon completion, the Cunard Building's exterior and interior designs received critical acclaim. The Cunard Building's facade and principal first-floor interior spaces were designated as [[List of New York City Landmarks|landmarks]] by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1995.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Cunard Building is a 22-story building,<ref name=\"emporis\" /> bounded by the [[Bowling Green Offices Building]] (11 Broadway) to the south, Broadway to the east, [[Greenwich Street]] to the west, and Morris Street to the north.<ref name=\"NYT-Cunard-1919\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1918/02/20/archives/cunard-to-have-big-building-here-10000000-structure-of-26-stories.html|title=Cunard To Have Big Building Here; $10,000,000 Structure of 26 Stories Going Up on Site of Old Stevens House.|last=|first=|date=February 20, 1918|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 28, 2020|url-status=live|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=\"Tribune-Cunard-1919\" /> It is located across from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green Park]] to the southeast, and [[26 Broadway]] and the ''[[Charging Bull]]'' sculpture to the east.<ref name=\"lpc95\" /> While 25 Broadway is considered to be its primary address, it is also known as 13\u201327 Broadway, 13\u201339 Greenwich Street, and 1\u20139 Morris Street.<ref name=\"lpc95\" /><ref name=\"emporis\">{{cite web |url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115358/standard-poors-building-new-york-city-ny-usa |title=Standard & Poors Building |website=Emporis |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}</ref> The Cunard Building has a [[frontage]] of {{Convert|203|ft||abbr=}} along Broadway, {{Convert|231|ft||abbr=}} along Greenwich Street, and {{Convert|248|ft||abbr=}} along Morris Street.<ref name=\"AB p. 61\">{{harvnb|''Architecture and Building''|1921|ps=.|p=61}}</ref> Due to the irregular street grid of the area, none of its corners are at right angles.<ref name=\"AR-Cunard-1919\">{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 1919|title=The Cunard Building, New York|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2640733&view=1up&seq=260|journal=Architectural Review|volume=26|pages=113\u2013114|via=}}</ref><ref name=\"Tribune-Completed-1921\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43286591/|title=$20,000,000 Office Building Projects of Cunard and Munson Lines Completed|date=May 1, 1921|work=New-York Tribune|access-date=January 30, 2020|page=37|via=newspapers.com {{open access}}}}</ref>\n\nThe Cunard Building was largely designed by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]].<ref name=\"NYT-Cunard-1919\" /> The [[massing]] and [[facade]] were devised by [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings]], while exterior detail was created by Rochette & Parzini.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 5\">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1995|ps=.|p=5}}</ref> The structure was laid out so that ancillary structures such as smoke stacks, penthouses, and storage tanks could not be seen from the side.

The foundation columns were placed as close to the subway tunnel as possible, in order to reduce the length of the trusses, which would have had to carry heavy loads. All of the foundation columns were sunk to the depth of the rock underneath.<ref name=\"AR pp. 21\" />\n\nA [[cofferdam]] was then built on the eastern border of the site, and on part of the northern border. The rock surface underneath the building site was closer to the ground on the western side of the lot, requiring extensive excavation. On the eastern side of the lot, the rock surface sloped below the elevation of the subway tunnel. A {{Convert|6|ft|m|-thick|abbr=|adj=mid}} wall was built on the southern boundary of the Cunard lot, of which a {{Convert|2|ft||adj=on}} width was located under the Bowling Green Offices Building.

The columns of windows around the central pavilion, which is recessed further, are also set within a rusticated facade. The outer pavilions are set back beyond the 18th story to comply with the 1916 Zoning Resolution. The central pavilion contains a loggia between the 19th and 21st stories, also supported by Tuscan-style column pairs, and includes a [[mansard roof]] above the 22nd story.
