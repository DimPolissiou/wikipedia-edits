In most countries, \"police officer\" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank. In some, the use of the rank \"officer\" is legally reserved for military personnel.\n\nPolice officers are generally charged with the apprehension of [[criminal]]s and the prevention and detection of [[crime]], protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an [[Police oath|oath]], and have the power to [[arrest]] people and [[police custody|detain them]] for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some officers are trained in special duties, such as [[counter-terrorism]], [[surveillance]], [[child protection]], [[Very Important Person|VIP]] [[Protective security units|protection]], [[Civil law (common law)|civil law enforcement]], and investigation techniques into major crime including [[fraud]], [[rape]], [[murder]], and [[drug trafficking]]. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to pass themselves off as civilians. In most countries police officers are given exemptions from certain laws to perform their duties. For example an officer may use force if necessary to arrest or detain a person when it would ordinarily be assault. In some countries, officers can also break road rules to perform their duties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dulaney, W.

The more general term for the function is [[law enforcement officer]] or peace officer. A [[sheriff]] is typically the top police officer of a county, with that word coming from the person enforcing law over a [[shire]]. A person who has been deputized to serve the function of the sheriff is referred to as the deputy.\n\nPolice officers are those empowered by government to enforce the laws it creates. In ''[[The Federalist]]'' collection of articles and essays, [[James Madison]] wrote: \"[[:s:The Federalist (Dawson)/50|If men were angels, no Government would be necessary]]\". These words apply to those who serve government, including police. {{anchor|cop}}A common nickname for a police officer is \"cop\"; derived from the verb sense \"to arrest\", itself derived from \"to grab\". Thus, \"someone who captures\", a \"copper\", was shortened to just \"cop\".<ref>{{cite book|last = Dalzell|first = T.|date = 2007|title = Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang|titlelink = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|location = New York|publisher = [[Routledge]]|page = 162|isbn = 9780415212595}}</ref> It may also find its origin in the Latin {{lang|la|capere}}, brought to English via the [[Old French]] {{lang|fr|caper}}.<ref>{{cite book|last = Partridge|first = E.|authorlink = Eric Partridge|date = 1972|title = A Dictionary of Historical Slang|titlelink = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|location = London|publisher = [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]|isbn = 9780140510461|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/lenglish00eric}}</ref>\n\n==Duties and functions==\nResponsibilities of a police officer are varied, and may differ greatly from within one political context to another. Typical duties relate to keeping the peace, law enforcement, protection of people and property and the investigation of crimes. Officers are expected to respond to a variety of situations that may arise while they are on duty. Rules and guidelines dictate how an officer should behave within the community, and in many contexts, restrictions are placed on what the uniformed officer wears. In some countries, [[rule making|rules and procedures]] dictate that a police officer is obliged to intervene in a criminal incident, even if they are off-duty. Police officers in nearly all countries retain their lawful powers while off duty.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://education-portal.com/articles/Police_Officer_Educational_Requirements_for_Police_Officers.html |title=Educational Requirements for Police Officers |work=education-portal.com |year=2011 |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the majority of [[Western world|Western]] legal systems, the major role of the police is to maintain order, keeping the peace through surveillance of the public, and the subsequent reporting and apprehension of suspected violators of the law. They also function to [[Deterrence (psychology)|discourage]] crimes through high-visibility policing, and most police forces have an investigative capability. Police have the legal authority to arrest and detain, usually granted by magistrates. Police officers also respond to emergency calls, along with routine [[community policing]].\n\nPolice are often used as an [[emergency service]] and may provide a public safety function at large gatherings, as well as in emergencies, [[Emergency preparedness|disasters]], [[search and rescue]] situations, and [[Car accident|road traffic collisions]]. To provide a prompt response in emergencies, the police often coordinate their operations with [[firefighting|fire]] and [[emergency medical service]]s. In some countries, individuals serve jointly as police officers as well as firefighters (creating the role of [[fire police]]). In many countries, there is a common [[emergency service number]] that allows the police, firefighters, or medical services to be summoned to an emergency. Some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] have outlined command procedures, for the use in major emergencies or disorder. The [[Gold Silver Bronze command structure]] is a system set up to improve communications between ground-based officers and the control room, typically, Bronze Commander would be a senior officer on the ground, coordinating the efforts in the center of the emergency, Silver Commanders would be positioned in an 'Incident Control Room' erected to improve better communications at the scene, and a Gold Commander who would be in the Control Room.\n\nPolice are also responsible for reprimanding minor offenders by issuing [[summons|citations]] which typically may result in the imposition of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], particularly for violations of [[traffic]] law. Traffic enforcement is often and effectively accomplished by police officers on [[motorcycle]]s\u2014called ''motor officers,'' these officers refer to the motorcycles they ride on duty as simply ''motors.'' Police are also trained to assist persons in distress, such as motorists whose car has broken down and people experiencing a medical emergency. Police are typically trained in basic [[first aid]] such as [[CPR]].\n\nSome [[park ranger]]s are commissioned as law enforcement officers and carry out a law-enforcement role within [[national park]]s and other back-country wilderness and recreational areas, whereas [[Military police]] perform law enforcement functions within the military.\n\n==Entry and promotion qualifications==\nIn most countries, candidates for the police force must have completed some formal education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://study.com/requirements_to_become_a_police_officer.html|title=Requirements to Become a Police Officer|publisher=}}</ref> Increasing numbers of people are joining the police force who possess [[tertiary education]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://learn.org/articles/What_is_Tertiary_Education.html|title=What Is Tertiary Education?|publisher=}}</ref> and in response to this many police forces have developed a \"fast-track\" scheme whereby those with [[university degree]]s spend two to three years as a [[Constable]] before receiving promotion to higher ranks, such as [[Sergeant]]s or [[Inspector]]s. (Officers who work within investigative divisions or plainclothes are not necessarily of a higher rank but merely have different duties.){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Police officers are also recruited from those with experience in the military or security services. In the United States [[U.S. state|state]] laws may [[Codification (law)|codify]] statewide qualification standards regarding age, education, criminal record, and training but in other places requirements are set by local police agencies. Each local Police agency has different requirements. \n[[File:Pol mun agenti.jpg|thumb|Officers of the [[Municipal police (Italy)|Polizia Municipale]] from [[Piacenza]], [[Italy]]]]\nPromotion is not automatic and usually requires the candidate to pass some kind of examination, interview board or other selection procedure. Although promotion normally includes an increase in [[salary]], it also brings with it an increase in responsibility and for most, an increase in administrative paperwork. There is no stigma attached to this, as experienced line patrol officers are highly regarded.\n\nDependent upon each agency, but generally after completing two years of service, officers may apply for specialist positions, such as [[detective]], [[police dog]] handler, [[mounted police]] officer, [[motorcycle]] officer, [[water police]] officer, or [[firearms officer]] (in countries where police are not routinely armed).\n\nIn some countries, including [[Singapore]], police ranks are supplemented through [[conscription]], similar to [[national service]] in the military. Qualifications may thus be relaxed or enhanced depending on the target mix of conscripts. Conscripts face tougher physical requirements in areas such as eyesight, but minimum academic qualification requirements are less stringent. Some join as volunteers, again via differing qualification requirements.\n\n==Pay==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}\nIn some societies, police officers are paid relatively well compared to other occupations; their pay depends on what rank they are within their police force and how many years they have served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police-information.co.uk/policepay.htm |title=Police Pay |publisher=Police-information.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}</ref>\nIn the United States, an average police officer's salary is between $53,561 and $64,581 in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.policeteststudyguide.com/police-officer-salaries-in-the-us/ |title=Police Pay |publisher=Police Test Study Guide |date= |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref> In the United Kingdom for the year 2015\u201316 a police officer's average salary was \u00a330,901.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n== Occupational safety and health ==\n{{main article|Police officer safety and health}}There are numerous issues affecting the [[Occupational safety and health|safety and health]] of police officers, including line of duty deaths and [[occupational stress]].

It stars [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Olivia Cooke]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[T.J. Miller]], [[Simon Pegg]], and [[Mark Rylance]]. It takes place in 2045, when much of humanity uses the [[virtual reality]] software OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation) to escape the desolation of the real world. Orphaned teenager Wade Watts (Sheridan) finds clues to a hidden game that promises OASIS's ownership to the winner, and he and four allies try to complete it before a corporation run by businessman Nolan Sorrento (Mendelsohn) can do so.\n\n''Ready Player One'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on March 11, 2018, and was theatrically released by [[Warner Bros.]] Pictures in the United States on March 29, 2018, in 2D, [[RealD 3D]], [[IMAX]] and IMAX 3D. It grossed over $582 million and received generally positive reviews; critics praised its visuals, brisk pacing, the performances of Sheridan and Rylance, and the many cultural references from various media. The film was noted to have significant differences from the book; some critics said the film's plot was an improvement over the source material.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uploadvr.com/ready-player-one-movie-review-roundup-another-spielberg-classic/|title=Ready Player One Movie Review Roundup: Another Spielberg Classic?|first1=David|last1=Jagneaux|work=[[UploadVR]]|date=March 13, 2018|accessdate=March 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327144838/https://uploadvr.com/ready-player-one-movie-review-roundup-another-spielberg-classic/#|archive-date=March 27, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ready-player-one-review-roundup,news-26776.html|title=Ready Player One Review Roundup: Pretty, Flawed|first1=Henry T.|last1=Casey|work=Tom's Guide|publisher=[[Purch Group]]|date=March 14, 2018|accessdate=March 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326202506/https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ready-player-one-review-roundup,news-26776.html#|archive-date=March 26, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It also received nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]], [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]], and [[72nd British Academy Film Awards]], all for visual effects.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2045, people seek regular escape from life through the [[virtual reality]] entertainment universe called OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), co-created by James Halliday and Ogden Morrow of Gregarious Games. After Halliday's death, a pre-recorded message left by his [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] Anorak announces a game, granting ownership of OASIS to the first to find the Golden [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] within it, which is locked behind a gate requiring three keys which players can obtain by accomplishing three challenges.\n\nThe contest has lured a number of 'Gunters', or egg hunters, and the interest of Nolan Sorrento, the CEO of Innovative Online Industries (IOI) who seeks to control OASIS himself in order to insert intrusive [[online advertising]]. IOI uses a number of [[indentured servants]] as well as an army of employees called \"Sixers\" to find the egg.{{efn|IOI employees are called Sixers because their employee IDs are six digits long and begin with the number 6.}}\n\nWade Watts is an orphaned teenager living in the slums, or 'Stacks', of [[Columbus, Ohio]], with his Aunt Alice and her abusive boyfriend, Rick. In the OASIS, his avatar Parzival is best friends with Aech, a virtual mechanic. Wade (as the film's narrating voice) explains that the First Quest of the Hunt to the egg was discovered long before by an unnamed Gunter as a [[Driving simulator|simulated car and motorbike race]] in a recreation of [[Manhattan]] filled with [[Kaiju|movie monsters]] and other dangers. Numerous people participate every day (including Parzival on a modified [[DeLorean time machine]] and Aech on a [[Bigfoot (truck)|Bigfoot]] [[monster truck]]), but no one is able to finish the race due to an apparently invincible [[King Kong]] [[Boss (video games)|boss]] at the end of the track. One day, at the race, Wade meets [[Internet celebrity]] Art3mis and saves her from being \"zeroed out\" (dying in-game, which would result in losing all of her avatar's properties) and they start a friendship. Later, while consulting Halliday's ([[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]) Journals with their Curator, Parzival discovers [[Thinking outside the box|an unorthodox way to win]] the race, but is seen by Art3mis and tells it to Aech, who, in turn, tells it to his friends Daito and Sho.\n\nSorrento learns of Parzival's real-life identity through OASIS mercenary i-R0k, and attempts to sway Wade into joining IOI, but he refuses. In retaliation, Sorrento has IOI's head of operations F'Nale Zandor bomb Wade's stack, killing Alice and Rick. Art3mis's player Samantha Cook rescues Wade and they commence a search for Kira in the Overlook Hotel from ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' to get the second key. They are soon found by IOI. Samantha is captured and remanded to one of IOI's Loyalty Centers to work off the debt IOI acquired. Wade is extracted by the other High Five\u2014Helen (Aech), Toshiro (Daito), and Zhou (Sho). The group tracks down Samantha's location at IOI and they remotely help her escape, allowing her to assist them in the OASIS as Art3mis. \n\nThe third challenge requires one to play Halliday's favorite [[Atari 2600]] game, in a castle on [[Voltron|Planet Doom]], which Sorrento has protected with a force field emitted by a magical in-game artifact called the Orb of Osuvox. Parzival recruits other OASIS players to help the rebels attack the IOI forces around the castle. Art3mis deactivates the force field, allowing Parzival to reach the console. After a brief fight, Sorrento detonates a bomb called the Cataclyst that kills all the avatars on Planet Doom. However, due to having won a coin from a bet with the Curator earlier, Parzival gets an [[extra life]], proceeding to play through ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' to find [[Adventure (Atari 2600)#Easter egg|its Easter egg]]; he is awarded the last key. He opens the gate and is greeted by Anorak and given a contract to sign. However, he recognizes it as the same contract Morrow signed to turn over his part of Gregarious and refuses. Anorak changes form, becomes Halliday, and reveals that the contract was the final test to make sure Parzival would not make the same mistakes he did. Parzival is given the Golden Egg and control of OASIS.\n\nIn the real world, Sorrento and Zandor fail to stop Parzival before he wins. After accepting defeat, they are quickly arrested for the bombing. Morrow, revealed to have been the Curator, offers his services to Wade and he gladly accepts. Wade decides to run OASIS with the other High Five, shutting it down twice a week to encourage people to spend more time in the real world. They also block loyalty centers from accessing the system, forcing the end of IOI's indentured servitude program. Meanwhile, Wade and Samantha start a relationship and move into a luxury apartment together.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--In order of end credits-->\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as Wade Watts / Parzival, a Gunter who wishes to win so he can leave the Stacks.

The Ludgate Hill Car Park lot on Lionel Street, in which caravan homes were partially built was also used and a planned explosion there caused some local business and homes to call emergency services, as no prior notification were given by the production team.

It stars [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Olivia Cooke]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[T.J. Miller]], [[Simon Pegg]], and [[Mark Rylance]]. It takes place in 2045, when much of humanity uses the [[virtual reality]] software OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation) to escape the desolation of the real world. Orphaned teenager Wade Watts (Sheridan) finds clues to a hidden game that promises OASIS's ownership to the winner, and he and four allies try to complete it before a corporation run by businessman Nolan Sorrento (Mendelsohn) can do so.\n\n''Ready Player One'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on March 11, 2018, and was theatrically released by [[Warner Bros.]] Pictures in the United States on March 29, 2018, in 2D, [[RealD 3D]], [[IMAX]] and IMAX 3D. It grossed over $582 million and received generally positive reviews; critics praised its visuals, brisk pacing, the performances of Sheridan and Rylance, and the many cultural references from various media. The film was noted to have significant differences from the book; some critics said the film's plot was an improvement over the source material.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uploadvr.com/ready-player-one-movie-review-roundup-another-spielberg-classic/|title=Ready Player One Movie Review Roundup: Another Spielberg Classic?|first1=David|last1=Jagneaux|work=[[UploadVR]]|date=March 13, 2018|accessdate=March 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327144838/https://uploadvr.com/ready-player-one-movie-review-roundup-another-spielberg-classic/#|archive-date=March 27, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ready-player-one-review-roundup,news-26776.html|title=Ready Player One Review Roundup: Pretty, Flawed|first1=Henry T.|last1=Casey|work=Tom's Guide|publisher=[[Purch Group]]|date=March 14, 2018|accessdate=March 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326202506/https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ready-player-one-review-roundup,news-26776.html#|archive-date=March 26, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It also received nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]], [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]], and [[72nd British Academy Film Awards]], all for visual effects.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2045, people seek regular escape from life through the [[virtual reality]] entertainment universe called OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), co-created by James Halliday and Ogden Morrow of Gregarious Games. After Halliday's death, a pre-recorded message left by his [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] Anorak announces a game, granting ownership of OASIS to the first to find the Golden [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] within it, which is locked behind a gate requiring three keys which players can obtain by accomplishing three challenges.\n\nThe contest has lured a number of 'Gunters', or egg hunters, and the interest of Nolan Sorrento, the CEO of Innovative Online Industries (IOI) who seeks to control OASIS himself in order to insert intrusive [[online advertising]]. IOI uses a number of [[indentured servants]] as well as an army of employees called \"Sixers\" to find the egg.{{efn|IOI employees are called Sixers because their employee IDs are six digits long and begin with the number 6.}}\n\nWade Watts is an orphaned teenager living in the slums, or 'Stacks', of [[Columbus, Ohio]], with his Aunt Alice and her abusive boyfriend, Rick. In the OASIS, his avatar Parzival is best friends with Aech, a virtual mechanic. Wade (as the film's narrating voice) explains that the First Quest of the Hunt to the egg was discovered long before by an unnamed Gunter as a [[Driving simulator|simulated car and motorbike race]] in a recreation of [[Manhattan]] filled with [[Kaiju|movie monsters]] and other dangers. Numerous people participate every day (including Parzival on a modified [[DeLorean time machine]] and Aech on a [[Bigfoot (truck)|Bigfoot]] [[monster truck]]), but no one is able to finish the race due to an apparently invincible [[King Kong]] [[Boss (video games)|boss]] at the end of the track. One day, at the race, Wade meets [[Internet celebrity]] Art3mis and saves her from being \"zeroed out\" (dying in-game, which would result in losing all of her avatar's properties) and they start a friendship. Later, while consulting Halliday's ([[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]) Journals with their Curator, Parzival discovers [[Thinking outside the box|an unorthodox way to win]] the race, but is seen by Art3mis and tells it to Aech, who, in turn, tells it to his friends Daito and Sho.\n\nSorrento learns of Parzival's real-life identity through OASIS mercenary i-R0k, and attempts to sway Wade into joining IOI, but he refuses. In retaliation, Sorrento has IOI's head of operations F'Nale Zandor bomb Wade's stack, killing Alice and Rick. Art3mis's player Samantha Cook rescues Wade and they commence a search for Kira in the Overlook Hotel from ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' to get the second key. They are soon found by IOI. Samantha is captured and remanded to one of IOI's Loyalty Centers to work off the debt IOI acquired. Wade is extracted by the other High Five\u2014Helen (Aech), Toshiro (Daito), and Zhou (Sho). The group tracks down Samantha's location at IOI and they remotely help her escape, allowing her to assist them in the OASIS as Art3mis. \n\nThe third challenge requires one to play Halliday's favorite [[Atari 2600]] game, in a castle on [[Voltron|Planet Doom]], which Sorrento has protected with a force field emitted by a magical in-game artifact called the Orb of Osuvox. Parzival recruits other OASIS players to help the rebels attack the IOI forces around the castle. Art3mis deactivates the force field, allowing Parzival to reach the console. After a brief fight, Sorrento detonates a bomb called the Cataclyst that kills all the avatars on Planet Doom. However, due to having won a coin from a bet with the Curator earlier, Parzival gets an [[extra life]], proceeding to play through ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' to find [[Adventure (Atari 2600)#Easter egg|its Easter egg]]; he is awarded the last key. He opens the gate and is greeted by Anorak and given a contract to sign. However, he recognizes it as the same contract Morrow signed to turn over his part of Gregarious and refuses. Anorak changes form, becomes Halliday, and reveals that the contract was the final test to make sure Parzival would not make the same mistakes he did. Parzival is given the Golden Egg and control of OASIS.\n\nIn the real world, Sorrento and Zandor fail to stop Parzival before he wins. After accepting defeat, they are quickly arrested for the bombing. Morrow, revealed to have been the Curator, offers his services to Wade and he gladly accepts. Wade decides to run OASIS with the other High Five, shutting it down twice a week to encourage people to spend more time in the real world. They also block loyalty centers from accessing the system, forcing the end of IOI's indentured servitude program. Meanwhile, Wade and Samantha start a relationship and move into a luxury apartment together.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--In order of end credits-->\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as Wade Watts / Parzival, a Gunter who wishes to win so he can leave the Stacks. Wade's avatar Parzival is a white-haired man with arm and facial tattoos.\n* [[Olivia Cooke]] as Samantha Cook / Art3mis, a well-known Gunter who works with various allies to ensure the OASIS is kept free and out of the hands of IOI, both inside the game and in the real world. Samantha has a birthmark around her right eye, which she is somewhat conscious of; her avatar Art3mis, a pink-skinned female humanoid with spiky hair, adopts this birthmark late in the film.\n* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as Nolan Sorrento / IOI-655321, the [[CEO]] of Innovative Online Industries who seeks full control over the OASIS.\n* [[Lena Waithe]] as Helen Harris / Aech, a Gunter and long-time friend of Wade's who works as a [[mechanic]] and [[Mod (video games)|modder]] in the OASIS and engages in [[Player versus player|PVP]] matches.

Miller]] as i-R0k, a freelance dealer and [[mercenary]] often employed by IOI. He shares his name with a minor character from the novel who unwillingly helps IOI discover the location of the First Quest, but is otherwise unrelated.\n* [[Simon Pegg]] as Ogden Morrow / Curator, a co-creator of the OASIS, who eventually left Gregarious Games. He is concerned that many people have developed an unhealthy dependency on the game. Odgen's avatar in this film is a [[Ask Jeeves|butler-styled]] [[robot]] that works in the Halliday Archives in the OASIS.\n* [[Mark Rylance]] as James Halliday / Anorak the All-Knowing, the deceased co-creator of the OASIS who reveals after his death that an Easter Egg is hidden in the OASIS that grants control over the OASIS to its winner. James' avatar is a hooded [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]].\n* Philip Zhao as Zhou / Sho, a Chinese Gunter and one of the \"High Five\". He is based upon Akihide \"Shoto\" Karatsu, a Japanese gunter<!---SIC---> featured in the novel. Zhou's avatar is a lizard-like [[ninja]].\n* [[Win Morisaki]] as Toshiro / Daito, a Japanese Gunter and one of the \"High Five\".

The chase was edited to make the street appear longer than it actually is. The backpackers hostel Hatters, also on Livery Street, was used for internal filming for a basement scene. The Ludgate Hill Car Park lot on Lionel Street, in which caravan homes were partially built was also used and a planned explosion there caused some local business and homes to call emergency services, as no prior notification were given by the production team. Other locations in the city included the former industrial area of [[Digbeth]], in a rooftop scene that overlooks the Birmingham City Centre skyline.

Four albums by the duo have been released since Carter's death. She has also released four solo recordings, some of which have included previously unreleased songs by Carter, as well as two songbooks.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Homestead, Florida]], Tracy Grammer was raised in [[Southern California]] and began her musical career on a borrowed violin at the age of 9. She came from a musical family. Her father, Jim Grammer, played acoustic, electric, and lap steel guitars. Distant relation Leo Fortin played violin and was best known for playing double-trumpets in [[Lawrence Welk]]'s orchestra. She earned a Bachelor's degree in English literature from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].\n\nFollowing Dave Carter's death in 2002, Grammer made the decision to play solo at several of the dates that they had scheduled, most notably an engagement at the [[Falcon Ridge Folk Festival]]. Taking into account Carter's expressed wish that eventually she would sing all of the songs, she continued playing Carter's music. She has continued to tour solo and has released four solo albums. The first, ''[[The Verdant Mile]]'', is an EP containing her first original composition, the title track, a eulogy for Carter.\n\nHer second solo release, ''[[Flower of Avalon]]'', consists of ten tracks, nine of which were written by Carter before her death, and one of which is a traditional folk song arranged by [[William Jolliff]]. The album was co-produced by Grammer and [[John Jennings (musician)|John Jennings]]. Featured artists include [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], who provided many backing vocals, and [[Jim Henry (folk singer)|Jim Henry]], Grammer's touring partner and [[Signature Sounds]] label mate.\n\nHer third album, ''[[Book of Sparrows]]'', was released in November, 2007 and is a seven-song EP featuring covers of songs by [[Tom Russell]], [[Kate Power]], [[David Francey]], Dave Carter, and [[Paul Simon]]. The EP was co-produced by Grammer and Jim Henry.\n\nIn 2005, her company, Tracy Grammer Music, made arrangements with Elise Fischer, Carter's sister and copyright owner, to administer the catalog of Dave Carter, giving her effective control over the duo's music.\n\nIn addition to touring, Grammer was choral conductor at the Academy at Charlemont from 2010 until 2012. She released an album on [[Red House Records]] in February 2012, ''[[Little Blue Egg]]'', which contained 11 previously-unheard duo recordings that had been recovered from the Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer archives. Later that year, she and Red House released ''[[Joy My Love]]'', a limited-edition EP containing five more of the duo's archived recordings.\n\nIn January 2014, Tracy Grammer joined 21 other female singer-songwriters in a project headed by Cary Cooper called \"RealWomenRealSongs.\" The project required each participant to write and upload one song per week for 52 weeks to the RealWomenRealSongs YouTube channel.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Hm0si7KuKwSTNZadL2AUg</ref> Several of the songs written during that project appear on Grammer's fourth solo recording and first songwriter release, ''[[Low Tide]]'' (Tracy Grammer Music, 2018). ''[[Low Tide]]'' was funded entirely by a Kickstarter campaign that reached its goal in just 34 hours and engaged more than 700 fans.\n\nIn 2016, Grammer debuted a new presentation called \"words+music\" that weaves readings from her memoir-in-progress with songs and musical excerpts on violin and guitar. words+music is an occasional show focusing on Grammer's life with Dave Carter, including the effect of Carter's gender transition on the duo's life and work together, and Grammer's path to back to the stage after Carter's death.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Solo recordings===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Known as the [[Ten Years' War|Ten Years\u2019 War,]] it raged from 1868 to 1878 and saw Cuban insurgents pitted against [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial]] forces in a contest for, among other things, Cuban independence and the abolition of [[Slavery in Cuba|Cuban slavery]]. The [[United States]], which had recently experienced its own [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]], represented a potential ally of the Cuban insurgency. Many Cuban insurgency leaders, expatriates, and anti-slavery activists within the United States advocated for American intervention in the conflict.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant|Grant administration]] was divided on whether or not to intervene. [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] John Rawlins supported intervention in Cuba, as did [[Daniel Sickles]], [[List of ambassadors of the United States to Spain|ambassador to Spain]]. [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]] himself was sympathetic to the cause of the insurgents. However, others within American politics, particularly [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hamilton Fish]], were more skeptical of intervention. They considered it imprudent to intervene so soon after the [[American Civil War]], they thought American intervention on Cuba\u2019s behalf would put America in a difficult diplomatic situation, and they were cynical regarding American race relations and the ability of the Cuban people to govern themselves. Consequently, [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]] offered to serve as an intermediary between Madrid and the Cuban insurgents under certain conditions, including the concession of Cuban independence and abolition of Cuban slavery. Beyond this offer, the United States did not interfere.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Priest|first=Andrew|date=October 25, 2013|title=Thinking about Empire: The Administration of Ulysses S.

Dennis collection of stereoscopic views.png|thumb|The Cooper Institute in New York, location of the first meeting of the Cuban Anti-Slavery Committee]]Fueled by witnessing many former slaves escaping from Cuba amidst the ongoing situation and making their way to the United States, [[Henry Highland Garnet]] and others formed the Cuban Anti-Slavery Committee. Garnet and others were quick to support the movement in Cuba because the Cuban independence movement was multi-racial, a model that they hoped to adopt in the United States. The first meeting was held at the [[Cooper Union|Cooper Institute]] in [[Manhattan]]. Shortly thereafter, another meeting was held in [[Boston]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Horne|first=Gerald|title=Race to Revolution|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-58367-446-8|location=New York|pages=127-128}}</ref> \n\nThe first meeting was attended by a wide variety of individuals. While [[African Americans]] and Cuban [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] made up the majority of the attendants, reporters and other individuals that were present ensured that the gather was widely publicized and highly diverse.<ref name=\":4\" /> Garnet gave the keynote address in the Great Hall of the Institute, and it was greatly enjoyed by those present.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ortiz|first=Paul|title=An African American and Latinx History of the United States|publisher=Beacon Press|year=2018|isbn=9780807005934|location=Boston|pages=77-78}}</ref> The meeting resulted in the creation of the Committee, whose goal was to gather signatures across the country in support of Cuban abolitionism. Accordingly, future meetings were planned in many cities, including [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] The signature campaign was also accompanied with an educational campaign.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ortiz|first=Paul|title=An African American and Latinx History of the United States|publisher=Beacon Press|year=2018|isbn=9780807005934|location=Boston|pages=78}}</ref>\n== Purpose ==\nThe Committee was originally convened in order to gather support for a pressure campaign in favor of United States recognition of, and support for, the Cuban belligerents.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boutelle|first=R.J.|date=2015|title=Manifest Diaspora: Black Transamerican Politics and Autoarchiving in \"Slavery in Cuba\"|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24570165|journal=MELUS|volume=40|pages=119|via=JSTOR}}</ref> Its founding members considered the war in Cuba to be a war against slavery and [[Old World]] [[colonialism]] with ramifications for the entire [[Western Hemisphere|hemisphere]]. Given the multiracial makeup of the insurgent forces, they also viewed it as a model for interracial cooperation and equality in the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Johnetta B.|date=1977|title=AFRO-AMERICAN SOLIDARITY WITH CUBA|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41058664|journal=The Black Scholar|volume=8|pages=75|via=JSTOR}}</ref> \n\nA large motivating factor for many individuals within the Committee was the hope that championing abolition movements abroad would bring more racial equality at home. Despite their freedom from slavery, African American individuals were still oppressed in a number of ways during this time period. Because of this, they often felt like their victories were incomplete. Winning more civil liberty victories abroad would help set a powerful precedence for civil conduct within the United States. Many individuals also felt that it was the country's inherent duty to fight for abolition abroad, based on the principles found in the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Ortiz|first=Paul|title=An African American and Latinx History of the United States|publisher=Beacon Press|year=2018|isbn=9780807005934|location=Boston|pages=80}}</ref>\n\nReverend Garnet\u2019s activity with the organization, in particular, was dedicated to advancing the proposition that slavery was not defeated until it was defeated everywhere, that the African American activist\u2019s work was not done until slavery was eradicated from the Americas. In this light, the Cuban revolution represented a continuation of the abolition efforts that were so recently successful in the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boutelle|first=R.J.|date=2015|title=Manifest Diaspora: Black Transamerican Politics and Autoarchiving in \"Slavery in Cuba\"|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24570165|journal=MELUS|volume=40|pages=121|via=JSTOR}}</ref> \n\n== Prominent Members ==\n[[File:Motto henry highland garnet original.jpg|alt=|thumb|Henry Highland Garnet, Secretary of the Cuban Anti-Slavery Committee]]\n[[Samuel R.

Known as the [[Ten Years' War|Ten Years\u2019 War,]] it raged from 1868 to 1878 and saw Cuban insurgents pitted against [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial]] forces in a contest for, among other things, Cuban independence and the abolition of [[Slavery in Cuba|Cuban slavery]]. The [[United States]], which had recently experienced its own [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]], represented a potential ally of the Cuban insurgency. Many Cuban insurgency leaders, expatriates, and anti-slavery activists within the United States advocated for American intervention in the conflict.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant|Grant administration]] was divided on whether or not to intervene. [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] John Rawlins supported intervention in Cuba, as did [[Daniel Sickles]], [[List of ambassadors of the United States to Spain|ambassador to Spain]]. [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]] himself was sympathetic to the cause of the insurgents. However, others within American politics, particularly [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hamilton Fish]], were more skeptical of intervention. They considered it imprudent to intervene so soon after the [[American Civil War]], they thought American intervention on Cuba\u2019s behalf would put America in a difficult diplomatic situation, and they were cynical regarding American race relations and the ability of the Cuban people to govern themselves. Consequently, [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]] offered to serve as an intermediary between Madrid and the Cuban insurgents under certain conditions, including the concession of Cuban independence and abolition of Cuban slavery. Beyond this offer, the United States did not interfere.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Priest|first=Andrew|date=October 25, 2013|title=Thinking about Empire: The Administration of Ulysses S.

Dennis collection of stereoscopic views.png|thumb|The Cooper Institute in New York, location of the first meeting of the Cuban Anti-Slavery Committee]]Fueled by witnessing many former slaves escaping from Cuba amidst the ongoing situation and making their way to the United States, [[Henry Highland Garnet]] and others formed the Cuban Anti-Slavery Committee. Garnet and others were quick to support the movement in Cuba because the Cuban independence movement was multi-racial, a model that they hoped to adopt in the United States. The first meeting was held at the [[Cooper Union|Cooper Institute]] in [[Manhattan]]. Shortly thereafter, another meeting was held in [[Boston]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Horne|first=Gerald|title=Race to Revolution|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-58367-446-8|location=New York|pages=127-128}}</ref> \n\nThe first meeting was attended by a wide variety of individuals. While [[African Americans]] and Cuban [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] made up the majority of the attendants, reporters and other individuals that were present ensured that the gather was widely publicized and highly diverse.<ref name=\":4\" /> Garnet gave the keynote address in the Great Hall of the Institute, and it was greatly enjoyed by those present.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ortiz|first=Paul|title=An African American and Latinx History of the United States|publisher=Beacon Press|year=2018|isbn=9780807005934|location=Boston|pages=77-78}}</ref> The meeting resulted in the creation of the Committee, whose goal was to gather signatures across the country in support of Cuban abolitionism. Accordingly, future meetings were planned in many cities, including [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] The signature campaign was also accompanied with an educational campaign.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ortiz|first=Paul|title=An African American and Latinx History of the United States|publisher=Beacon Press|year=2018|isbn=9780807005934|location=Boston|pages=78}}</ref>\n== Purpose ==\nThe Committee was originally convened in order to gather support for a pressure campaign in favor of United States recognition of, and support for, the Cuban belligerents.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boutelle|first=R.J.|date=2015|title=Manifest Diaspora: Black Transamerican Politics and Autoarchiving in \"Slavery in Cuba\"|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24570165|journal=MELUS|volume=40|pages=119|via=JSTOR}}</ref> Its founding members considered the war in Cuba to be a war against slavery and [[Old World]] [[colonialism]] with ramifications for the entire [[Western Hemisphere|hemisphere]]. Given the multiracial makeup of the insurgent forces, they also viewed it as a model for interracial cooperation and equality in the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Johnetta B.|date=1977|title=AFRO-AMERICAN SOLIDARITY WITH CUBA|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41058664|journal=The Black Scholar|volume=8|pages=75|via=JSTOR}}</ref> \n\nA large motivating factor for many individuals within the Committee was the hope that championing abolition movements abroad would bring more racial equality at home. Despite their freedom from slavery, African American individuals were still oppressed in a number of ways during this time period. Because of this, they often felt like their victories were incomplete. Winning more civil liberty victories abroad would help set a powerful precedence for civil conduct within the United States. Many individuals also felt that it was the country's inherent duty to fight for abolition abroad, based on the principles found in the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Ortiz|first=Paul|title=An African American and Latinx History of the United States|publisher=Beacon Press|year=2018|isbn=9780807005934|location=Boston|pages=80}}</ref>\n\nReverend Garnet\u2019s activity with the organization, in particular, was dedicated to advancing the proposition that slavery was not defeated until it was defeated everywhere, that the African American activist\u2019s work was not done until slavery was eradicated from the Americas. In this light, the Cuban revolution represented a continuation of the abolition efforts that were so recently successful in the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boutelle|first=R.J.|date=2015|title=Manifest Diaspora: Black Transamerican Politics and Autoarchiving in \"Slavery in Cuba\"|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24570165|journal=MELUS|volume=40|pages=121|via=JSTOR}}</ref> \n\n== Prominent Members ==\n[[File:Motto henry highland garnet original.jpg|alt=|thumb|Henry Highland Garnet, Secretary of the Cuban Anti-Slavery Committee]]\n[[Samuel R.
