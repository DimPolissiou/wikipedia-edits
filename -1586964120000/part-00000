However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide.\n\n[[File:Koeh-232.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Oryza sativa]]'', commonly known as Asian rice]]\nThe traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound planning and servicing of the water damming and channeling, but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters [[vermin]]. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of [[irrigation]] require higher effort in [[Weed control|weed]] and [[pest control]] during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.\n\nThe name [[wild rice]] is usually used for species of the genera ''[[Zizania (genus)|Zizania]]'' and ''[[Porteresia]]'', both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of ''[[Oryza]]''.\n\n==Etymology==\nFirst used in English in the middle of the 13th century, the word \"rice\" derives from the [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|ris}}, which comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|riso}}, in turn from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|or\u0233za}}, which derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f44\u03c1\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|oruza}}).

Medium-grain rice is used extensively in Japan, including to accompany savoury dishes, where it is usually served plain in a separate dish. Short-grain rice is often used for [[rice pudding]].\n\n[[Instant rice]] differs from [[parboiled rice]] in that it is fully cooked and then dried, though there is a significant degradation in taste and texture.

Rice produced in the US is usually fortified with vitamins and minerals, and rinsing will result in a loss of nutrients. Rice may be rinsed repeatedly until the rinse water is clear to improve the texture and taste.\n\nRice may be soaked to decrease cooking time, conserve fuel, minimize exposure to high temperature, and reduce stickiness. For some [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], soaking improves the texture of the cooked rice by increasing expansion of the grains. Rice may be soaked for 30 minutes up to several hours.\n\nBrown rice may be soaked in warm water for 20 hours to stimulate [[germination]]. This process, called [[germinated brown rice]] (GBR),<ref>{{cite web |title=Marketing of Value-Added Rice Products in Japan: Germinated Grown Rice and Rice Bread |url=http://www.hatsuga.com/DOMER/english/en/GBRRB.html |accessdate=February 12, 2004 |author1=Shoichi Ito |author2=Yukihiro Ishikawa |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Tottori University, Japan. |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HeLK3CUV?url=http://www.hatsuga.com/DOMER/english/en/GBRRB.html |archive-date=June 25, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> activates enzymes and enhances amino acids including [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] to improve the nutritional value of brown rice. This method is a result of research carried out for the United Nations [[International Year of Rice]].\n\nRice is cooked by [[boiling]] or [[steaming]], and absorbs water during cooking. With the absorption method, rice may be cooked in a volume of water equal to the volume of dry rice plus any evaporation losses.<ref>The Best Way to Cook Rice is All About the Right Ratio- What's Eating Dan? [[America's Test Kitchen]]</ref> With the rapid-boil method, rice may be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving. Rapid-boil preparation is not desirable with enriched rice, as much of the enrichment additives are lost when the water is discarded. Electric [[rice cooker]]s, popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. Rice (or any other grain) is sometimes quickly fried in oil or fat before boiling (for example [[saffron rice]] or [[risotto]]); this makes the cooked rice less sticky, and is a cooking style commonly called [[pilaf]] in [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] or [[biryani]] in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] .\n\n===Dishes===\n{{main|List of rice dishes}}\nIn [[Arab cuisine]], rice is an ingredient of many soups and dishes with fish, poultry, and other types of meat. It is used to stuff vegetables or is wrapped in grape leaves ([[dolma]]). When combined with milk, sugar, and honey, it is used to make desserts. In some regions, such as [[Tabaristan]], bread is made using rice flour. Rice may be made into [[congee]] (also called rice porridge or [[rice gruel]]) by adding more water than usual, so that the cooked rice is saturated with water, usually to the point that it disintegrates. Rice porridge is commonly eaten as a breakfast food, and is a traditional food for the sick.\n\n==Food==\n===Nutrition===\nRice is the [[staple food]] of over half the world's population. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa. Rice provides 20% of the world's dietary energy supply, while wheat supplies 19% and maize (corn) 5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rice is Life|publisher=Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations|year=2004|url=http://www.fao.org/rice2004/en/f-sheet/factsheet3.pdf|access-date=November 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110193515/http://www.fao.org/rice2004/en/f-sheet/factsheet3.pdf|archive-date=November 10, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCooked, unenriched, white, long-grained rice is composed of 68% water, 28% [[carbohydrates]], 3% [[protein]], and negligible [[fat]] (table). In a 100 gram serving, it provides 130 [[calories]] and contains no [[micronutrient]]s in significant amounts, with all less than 10% of the [[Daily Value]] (DV) (table). Cooked, white, short-grained rice also provides 130 calories and contains moderate amounts of [[B vitamins]], [[iron]], and [[manganese]] (10\u201317% DV) per 100 gram amount (table).\n\nA detailed analysis of nutrient content of rice suggests that the nutrition value of rice varies based on a number of factors.

The harvest season generally calls for thanksgiving feasts, while the concluding harvest rites called ''tango'' or ''tungul'' (a [[day of rest]]) entails a strict taboo on any agricultural work. Partaking of the ''bayah'' (rice beer), rice cakes, and [[betel nut]] constitutes an indelible practise during the festivities.\n\nThe Ifugao people practice traditional farming spending most of their labor at their terraces and forest lands while occasionally tending to root crop cultivation. The Ifugaos have also<ref name=\"tourism.gov.ph\" /> been known to culture edible shells, fruit trees, and other vegetables which have been exhibited among Ifugaos for generations. The building of the rice terraces consists of blanketing walls with stones and earth which are designed to draw water from a main irrigation canal above the terrace clusters. Indigenous rice terracing technologies have been identified with the Ifugao's rice terraces such as their knowledge of water irrigation, stonework, earthwork and terrace maintenance. As their source of life and art, the rice terraces have sustained and shaped the lives of the community members.\n\n====Sri Lanka====\n[[File:BeFunky Chromatic 1.jpg|thumbnail|Indian women separating rice from straw]]\nRice is the staple food amongst all the ethnic groups in [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Agriculture in Sri Lanka]] mainly depends on the rice cultivation. Rice production is acutely dependent on rainfall and government supply necessity of water through irrigation channels throughout the cultivation seasons. The principal cultivation season, known as \"Maha\", is from October to March and the subsidiary cultivation season, known as \"Yala\", is from April to September. During Maha season, there is usually enough water to sustain the cultivation of all rice fields, nevertheless in Yala season there is only enough water for cultivation of half of the land extent. Traditional rice varieties are now making a comeback with the recent interest in green foods.\n\n====Thailand====\n{{main|Rice production in Thailand}}\n[[File:Cambodian farmers planting rice.jpg|thumb|Cambodian women planting rice.]]\nRice is the main export of Thailand, especially white jasmine rice 105 (Dok Mali 105).<ref>The genetic wonder of Thai rice, 1998</ref> Thailand has a large number of rice varieties, 3,500 kinds with different characters, and five kinds of wild rice cultivates.<ref>Science and technology with Thai rice, National center for genetic engineering, 2003</ref> In each region of the country there are different rice seed types. Their use depends on weather, atmosphere, and topography.<ref name=\"The ecology of life, p. 44, 1998\">The ecology of life, p. 44, 1998</ref>\n\nThe northern region has both low lands and high lands. The farmers' usual crop is non-glutinous rice<ref name=\"The ecology of life, p. 44, 1998\"/> such as Niew Sun Pah Tong rice. This rice is naturally protected from leaf disease, and its paddy (unmilled rice) ({{lang-th|\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01}}) has a brown color.<ref>Punkhao (Niew San Pah Tong), www.brrd.in.th, 2013</ref> The northeastern region is a large area where farmers can cultivate about 36 million square meters of rice.

Most farmers grow Jao rice.<ref name=\"The ecology of life, p. 45, 1998\"/> For example, Pathum Thani 1 rice which has qualities similar to white jasmine 105 rice. Its paddy has the color of thatch and the cooked rice has fragrant grains also.<ref>Punkhao (Pathum Thani 1), www.brrd.in.th, 2013</ref>\n\nIn the southern region, most farmers transplant around boundaries to the flood plains or on the plains between mountains. Farming in the region is slower than other regions because the rainy season comes later.<ref name=\"The ecology of life, p. 45, 1998\"/> The popular rice varieties in this area are the Leb Nok Pattani seeds, a type of Jao rice. Its paddy has the color of thatch and it can be processed to make noodles.<ref>Punkhao ( Leb Nok Pattani), www.brrd.in.th, 2013</ref>\n\n====Companion plant====\nOne of the earliest known examples of [[companion plant]]ing is the growing of rice with [[Azolla]], the mosquito fern, which covers the top of a fresh rice paddy's water, blocking out any competing plants, as well as fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere for the rice to use. The rice is planted when it is tall enough to poke out above the azolla. This method has been used for at least a thousand years.\n\n=== Middle East ===\nRice was grown in some areas of [[Mesopotamia]] (southern Iraq).

It was known to Greece (where it is still cultivated in Macedonia and Thrace) by returning soldiers from Alexander the Great's military expedition to Asia. Large deposits of rice from the first century AD have been found in Roman camps in Germany.<ref>Sallare, Robert (1993), ''The Ecology of the Ancient Greek World'', Cornell Univ.

In the [[Russian Far East]] several ''japonica'' cultivars are grown in [[Primorye]] around the [[Khanka lake]]. Increasing scale of rice production in the region has recently brought criticism towards growers' alleged bad practices in regards to the environment.\n\n===Caribbean and Latin America===\n\nMost of the rice used today in the cuisine of the Americas is not native, but was introduced to Latin America and the Caribbean by [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonizers]] at an early date.

At the port of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from this region of Africa brought the highest prices due to their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] around [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].\n\nFrom the enslaved Africans, plantation owners learned how to dyke the [[marsh]]es and periodically flood the fields. At first the rice was laboriously milled by hand using large mortars and pestles made of wood, then winnowed in [[Muhlenbergia filipes|sweetgrass]] [[basket]]s (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the [[rice mill]] increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in 1787 by [[millwright]] Jonathan Lucas was another step forward.\n\nRice culture in the southeastern U.S. became less profitable with the loss of slave labor after the [[American Civil War]], and it finally died out just after the turn of the 20th century. Today, people can visit the only remaining rice plantation in South Carolina that still has the original [[winnowing barn]] and rice mill from the mid-19th century at the historic [[Mansfield Plantation]] in [[Georgetown, South Carolina]].

It is mainly cultivated by small farmers in holdings of less than one [[hectare]]. Rice is also a wage commodity for workers in the cash crop or non-agricultural sectors. Rice is vital for the nutrition of much of the population in Asia, as well as in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Africa; it is central to the food security of over half the world population.\n\nMany rice grain producing countries have significant losses post-harvest at the farm and because of poor roads, inadequate storage technologies, inefficient supply chains and farmer's inability to bring the produce into retail markets dominated by small shopkeepers. A World Bank \u2013 FAO study claims 8% to 26% of rice is lost in developing nations, on average, every year, because of post-harvest problems and poor infrastructure. Some sources claim the post-harvest losses exceed 40%.<ref name=FAORice1>{{cite web|title=Sustainable rice production for food security|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|year=2003|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/Y4751E/y4751e00.htm|access-date=March 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140615103824/http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y4751e/y4751e00.HTM|archive-date=June 15, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MISSING FOOD: The Case of Postharvest Grain Losses in Sub-Saharan Africa|publisher=The World Bank|date=April 2011|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTARD/Resources/MissingFoods10_web.pdf|access-date=November 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123194850/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTARD/Resources/MissingFoods10_web.pdf|archive-date=November 23, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Not only do these losses reduce food security in the world, the study claims that farmers in developing countries such as China, India and others lose approximately US$89 billion of income in preventable post-harvest farm losses, poor transport, the lack of proper storage and retail.

At this point in the process, the product is called [[brown rice]]. The milling may be continued, removing the [[bran]], ''i.e.'', the rest of the husk and the [[cereal germ|germ]], thereby creating [[white rice]]. White rice, which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; moreover, in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, brown rice helps to prevent the [[disease]] [[beriberi]].\n\nEither by hand or in a [[rice polisher]], white rice may be buffed with glucose or [[talc]] powder (often called polished rice, though this term may also refer to white rice in general), [[parboiled rice|parboiled]], or processed into flour. White rice may also be enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.\n\nIn some countries, a popular form, [[parboiled rice]] (also known as '''converted rice''' and '''easy-cook rice'''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | title=Types of rice | publisher=Rice Association | access-date=August 2, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802162740/http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | archive-date=August 2, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>) is subjected to a steaming or [[parboiling]] process while still a brown rice grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, and the color of the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially [[thiamine]]) to move into the [[endosperm]], so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.\n\n[[Rice bran]], called ''nuka'' in Japan, is a valuable commodity in Asia and is used for many daily needs. It is a moist, oily inner layer which is heated to produce oil. It is also used as a pickling bed in making [[Nukazuke|rice bran pickles]] and ''[[takuan]]''.\n\nRaw rice may be ground into flour for many uses, including making many kinds of beverages, such as ''[[amazake]], [[horchata]]'', [[rice milk]], and [[rice wine]]. Rice does not contain [[gluten]], so is suitable for people on a [[gluten-free diet]].<ref name=PenaginiDilillo2013>{{cite journal|vauthors=Penagini F, Dilillo D, Meneghin F, Mameli C, Fabiano V, Zuccotti GV|title=Gluten-free diet in children: an approach to a nutritionally adequate and balanced diet|journal=Nutrients|volume=5|issue=11|pages=4553\u201365|date=Nov 18, 2013|pmid=24253052|pmc=3847748|doi=10.3390/nu5114553|type=Review}}</ref> Rice may also be made into various types of [[noodle]]s. Raw, wild, or brown rice may also be consumed by [[Raw foodism|raw-foodist]] or [[fruitarians]] if soaked and [[Sprouting|sprouted]] (usually a week to 30 days \u2013 gaba rice).\n\nProcessed rice seeds must be boiled or steamed before eating. Boiled rice may be further fried in [[cooking oil]] or butter (known as [[fried rice]]), or beaten in a tub to make ''[[mochi]]''.\n\nRice is a good source of protein and a staple food in many parts of the world, but it is not a [[complete protein]]: it does not contain all of the [[essential amino acids]] in sufficient amounts for good health, and should be combined with other sources of protein, such as nuts, seeds, beans, fish, or meat.<ref name=\"Protein content\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0378-4290(02)00006-0 | title=Estimating the amino acid composition in milled rice by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy | author=Jianguo G.

This process takes advantage of the grains' water content and typically involves heating grains in a special chamber. Further puffing is sometimes accomplished by processing puffed pellets in a low-[[pressure]] chamber. The [[ideal gas law]] means either lowering the local pressure or raising the water temperature results in an increase in [[volume]] prior to water [[evaporation]], resulting in a puffy [[Texture (food)|texture]]. Bulk raw rice density is about 0.9 g/cm\u00b3. It decreases to less than one-tenth that when puffed.\n\n===Harvesting, drying and milling===\n[[File:Rice-combine-harvester, Katori-city, Japan.jpg|thumb|Rice combine harvester [[Katori, Chiba|Katori-city]], [[Chiba Prefecture]], [[Japan]]]]\n[[File:Rice farmers Mae Wang Chiang Mai Province.jpg|thumb|After the harvest, rice straw is gathered in the traditional way from small paddy fields in [[Mae Wang District]], [[Chiang Mai Province]], [[Thailand]]]]\n{{Further|Paddy field}}\n<!-- [[Paddy]] and [[Padi]] link to this section -->\nUnmilled rice, known as \"paddy\" (Indonesia and Malaysia: padi; Philippines, palay), is usually harvested when the grains have a moisture content of around 25%. In most Asian countries, where rice is almost entirely the product of [[smallholder]] agriculture, harvesting is carried out manually, although there is a growing interest in mechanical harvesting. Harvesting can be carried out by the farmers themselves, but is also frequently done by seasonal labor groups. Harvesting is followed by [[threshing]], either immediately or within a day or two. Again, much threshing is still carried out by hand but there is an increasing use of mechanical threshers. Subsequently, paddy needs to be dried to bring down the moisture content to no more than 20% for milling.\n\nA familiar sight in several Asian countries is paddy laid out to dry along roads. However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families. Mills either sun dry or use mechanical driers or both. Drying has to be carried out quickly to avoid the formation of molds. Mills range from simple [[Rice huller|hullers]], with a throughput of a couple of tonnes a day, that simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tonnes a day and produce highly polished rice. A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72% but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60%. These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their own consumption.\n\n===Distribution===\nBecause of the importance of rice to human nutrition and food security in Asia, the domestic rice markets tend to be subject to considerable state involvement. While the private sector plays a leading role in most countries, agencies such as [[Indonesian Bureau of Logistics|BULOG]] in Indonesia, the [[National Food Authority (Philippines)|NFA]] in the Philippines, VINAFOOD in Vietnam and the [[Food Corporation of India]] are all heavily involved in purchasing of paddy from farmers or rice from mills and in distributing rice to poorer people. BULOG and NFA monopolise rice imports into their countries while VINAFOOD controls all exports from Vietnam.<ref>Shahidur Rashid, Ashok Gulari and Ralph Cummings Jnr (eds) (2008).

Some upland rice farmers in Cambodia spread chopped leaves of the bitter bush (''[[Chromolaena odorata]]'') over the surface of fields after planting. This practice probably helps the soil retain moisture and thereby facilitates seed germination.

The genetically based ability of a rice variety to withstand pest attacks is called resistance. Three main types of plant resistance to pests are recognized as nonpreference, antibiosis, and tolerance.<ref name=j2/> Nonpreference (or antixenosis) describes host plants which insects prefer to avoid; antibiosis is where insect survival is reduced after the ingestion of host tissue; and tolerance is the capacity of a plant to produce high yield or retain high quality despite [[Home stored product entomology|insect infestation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kogan, M. |author2=Ortman, E.F. |title=Antixenosis a new term proposed to defined to describe Painter's \"non-preference\" modality of resistance |journal=Bull.

When a rice variety is no longer able to resist pest infestations, resistance is said to have broken down. Rice varieties that can be widely grown for many years in the presence of pests and retain their ability to withstand the pests are said to have durable resistance.

For example, Thai [[Jasmine rice]] is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as some long-grain rice contains less [[amylopectin]] than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants often serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice though short-grain rice is common as well. Japanese [[mochigome|mochi rice]] and Chinese [[sticky rice]] are short-grain. Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as \"glutinous rice\" (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to \"gluten\") to make [[zongzi]]. The [[Japanese rice|Japanese table rice]] is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese [[sake]] rice is another kind as well.\n\nIndian rice cultivars include long-grained and aromatic [[Basmati]] (\u0a2c\u0a3e\u0a38\u0a2e\u0a24\u0a40) (grown in the North), long and medium-grained [[Patna rice]], and in South India ([[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]) short-grained [[Sona Masuri]] (also called as Bangaru theegalu). In the state of Tamil Nadu, the most prized cultivar is [[Ponni Rice|''ponni'']] which is primarily grown in the delta regions of the [[Kaveri]] River. [[Kaveri]] is also referred to as ponni in the South and the name reflects the geographic region where it is grown. In the Western Indian state of [[Maharashtra]], a short grain variety called [[Ambemohar]] is very popular. This rice has a characteristic fragrance of Mango blossom.\n\nAromatic rices have definite aromas and flavors; the most noted cultivars are Thai fragrant rice, Basmati, Patna rice, Vietnamese fragrant rice, and a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] cultivar from America, sold under the trade name Texmati. Both Basmati and Texmati have a mild [[popcorn]]-like aroma and flavor. In Indonesia, there are also ''red'' and ''black'' cultivars.\n\nHigh-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in Africa and other dry [[ecosystems]], called the [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]] (NERICA) cultivars, have been developed. It is hoped that their cultivation will improve [[food security]] in West Africa.\n\nDraft [[genomes]] for the two most common rice cultivars, ''indica'' and ''japonica'', were published in April 2002. Rice was chosen as a [[model organism]] for the biology of grasses because of its relatively small genome (~430 mega[[base pairs]]). Rice was the first crop with a complete genome sequence.<ref>{{cite news | last=Gillis | first=Justing | title=Rice Genome Fully Mapped | date=August 11, 2005 | work=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001054.html | access-date=September 10, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330212346/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001054.html | archive-date=March 30, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn December 16, 2002, the [[UN General Assembly]] declared the year 2004 the International Year of Rice.

Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. In the presence of nitrogen fertilizers, and intensive crop management, these varieties increase their yield two to three times.\n\n=== Future potential ===\nAs the UN Millennium Development project seeks to spread global economic development to Africa, the \"Green Revolution\" is cited as the model for economic development. With the intent of replicating the successful Asian boom in agronomic productivity, groups like the [[Earth Institute]] are doing research on African agricultural systems, hoping to increase productivity. An important way this can happen is the production of \"[[New Rices for Africa]]\" (NERICA). These rices, selected to tolerate the low input and harsh growing conditions of African agriculture, are produced by the African Rice Center, and billed as technology \"from Africa, for Africa\". The NERICA have appeared in ''The New York Times'' (October 10, 2007) and ''International Herald Tribune'' (October 9, 2007), trumpeted as miracle crops that will dramatically increase rice yield in Africa and enable an economic resurgence.

Apart from this environmental benefit, the modification also increases the amount of rice grains by 43%, which makes it a useful tool in feeding a growing world population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Su|first1=J.|last2=Hu|first2=C.|last3=Yan|first3=X.|last4=Jin|first4=Y.|last5=Chen|first5=Z.|last6=Guan|first6=Q.|last7=Wang|first7=Y.|last8=Zhong|first8=D.|last9=Jansson|first9=C.|last10=Wang|first10=F.|last11=Schn\u00fcrer|first11=A.|last12=Sun|first12=C.|title=Expression of barley SUSIBA2 transcription factor yields high-starch low-methane rice|journal=Nature|date=July 22, 2015|volume=523|issue=7562|pages=602\u201306|doi=10.1038/nature14673|bibcode=2015Natur.523..602S|pmid=26200336}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gerry|title=Feeding the World One Genetically Modified Tomato at a Time: A Scientific Perspective|url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/feeding-the-world/|website=SITN|accessdate=September 11, 2015|date=2015-08-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910164510/http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/feeding-the-world/|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Meiosis and DNA repair==\nRice is used as a model organism for investigating the molecular mechanisms of meiosis and [[DNA repair]] in higher plants.

Medium-grain rice is used for sweet dishes, for ''[[risotto]]'' in Italy, and many rice dishes, such as ''[[arr\u00f2s negre]]'', in Spain. Some varieties of long-grain rice that are high in [[amylopectin]], known as Thai Sticky rice, are usually steamed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thaifoodandtravel.com/ingredients/stickyr.html|title=White Sticky Rice \u2013 Kao Niow|author=Loha-unchit, Kasma|accessdate=October 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013231727/http://thaifoodandtravel.com/ingredients/stickyr.html|archive-date=October 13, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> A stickier medium-grain rice is used for ''[[sushi]]''; the stickiness allows rice to hold its shape when molded. Medium-grain rice is used extensively in Japan, including to accompany savoury dishes, where it is usually served plain in a separate dish. Short-grain rice is often used for [[rice pudding]].\n\n[[Instant rice]] differs from [[parboiled rice]] in that it is fully cooked and then dried, though there is a significant degradation in taste and texture. Rice flour and [[starch]] often are used in [[Batter (cooking)|batters]] and breadings to increase crispiness.\n\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Stages of rice milling.jpg|thumb|Unmilled to milled rice, from left to right, [[brown rice]], rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]], [[white rice]] ''([[Japanese rice]])'']]\n[[File:Rice Animation.gif|thumb|A: Rice with [[chaff]]<br>B: [[Brown rice]]<br>C: Rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]]<br>D: [[White rice]] with [[bran]] [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>E: Musenmai (Japanese: [[:ja:\u7121\u6d17\u7c73|\u7121\u6d17\u7c73]]), \"Polished and ready to boil rice\", literally, non-wash rice<br>(1): [[Chaff]]<br>(2): [[Bran]]<br>(3): Bran [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>(4): [[Cereal germ]]<br>(5): [[Endosperm]]]]\n\nRice is typically rinsed before cooking to remove excess [[starch]]. Rice produced in the US is usually fortified with vitamins and minerals, and rinsing will result in a loss of nutrients. Rice may be rinsed repeatedly until the rinse water is clear to improve the texture and taste.\n\nRice may be soaked to decrease cooking time, conserve fuel, minimize exposure to high temperature, and reduce stickiness. For some [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], soaking improves the texture of the cooked rice by increasing expansion of the grains. Rice may be soaked for 30 minutes up to several hours.\n\nBrown rice may be soaked in warm water for 20 hours to stimulate [[germination]]. This process, called [[germinated brown rice]] (GBR),<ref>{{cite web |title=Marketing of Value-Added Rice Products in Japan: Germinated Grown Rice and Rice Bread |url=http://www.hatsuga.com/DOMER/english/en/GBRRB.html |accessdate=February 12, 2004 |author1=Shoichi Ito |author2=Yukihiro Ishikawa |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Tottori University, Japan. |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HeLK3CUV?url=http://www.hatsuga.com/DOMER/english/en/GBRRB.html |archive-date=June 25, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> activates enzymes and enhances amino acids including [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] to improve the nutritional value of brown rice. This method is a result of research carried out for the United Nations [[International Year of Rice]].\n\nRice is cooked by [[boiling]] or [[steaming]], and absorbs water during cooking. With the absorption method, rice may be cooked in a volume of water equal to the volume of dry rice plus any evaporation losses.<ref>The Best Way to Cook Rice is All About the Right Ratio- What's Eating Dan? [[America's Test Kitchen]]</ref> With the rapid-boil method, rice may be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving. Rapid-boil preparation is not desirable with enriched rice, as much of the enrichment additives are lost when the water is discarded. Electric [[rice cooker]]s, popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. Rice (or any other grain) is sometimes quickly fried in oil or fat before boiling (for example [[saffron rice]] or [[risotto]]); this makes the cooked rice less sticky, and is a cooking style commonly called [[pilaf]] in [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] or [[biryani]] in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] .\n\n===Dishes===\n{{main|List of rice dishes}}\nIn [[Arab cuisine]], rice is an ingredient of many soups and dishes with fish, poultry, and other types of meat. It is used to stuff vegetables or is wrapped in grape leaves ([[dolma]]). When combined with milk, sugar, and honey, it is used to make desserts. In some regions, such as [[Tabaristan]], bread is made using rice flour. Rice may be made into [[congee]] (also called rice porridge or [[rice gruel]]) by adding more water than usual, so that the cooked rice is saturated with water, usually to the point that it disintegrates. Rice porridge is commonly eaten as a breakfast food, and is a traditional food for the sick.\n\n==Food==\n===Nutrition===\nRice is the [[staple food]] of over half the world's population. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa. Rice provides 20% of the world's dietary energy supply, while wheat supplies 19% and maize (corn) 5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rice is Life|publisher=Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations|year=2004|url=http://www.fao.org/rice2004/en/f-sheet/factsheet3.pdf|access-date=November 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110193515/http://www.fao.org/rice2004/en/f-sheet/factsheet3.pdf|archive-date=November 10, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCooked, unenriched, white, long-grained rice is composed of 68% water, 28% [[carbohydrates]], 3% [[protein]], and negligible [[fat]] (table). In a 100 gram serving, it provides 130 [[calories]] and contains no [[micronutrient]]s in significant amounts, with all less than 10% of the [[Daily Value]] (DV) (table). Cooked, white, short-grained rice also provides 130 calories and contains moderate amounts of [[B vitamins]], [[iron]], and [[manganese]] (10\u201317% DV) per 100 gram amount (table).\n\nA detailed analysis of nutrient content of rice suggests that the nutrition value of rice varies based on a number of factors.

At first the rice was laboriously milled by hand using large mortars and pestles made of wood, then winnowed in [[Muhlenbergia filipes|sweetgrass]] [[basket]]s (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the [[rice mill]] increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in 1787 by [[millwright]] Jonathan Lucas was another step forward.\n\nRice culture in the southeastern U.S. became less profitable with the loss of slave labor after the [[American Civil War]], and it finally died out just after the turn of the 20th century. Today, people can visit the only remaining rice plantation in South Carolina that still has the original [[winnowing barn]] and rice mill from the mid-19th century at the historic [[Mansfield Plantation]] in [[Georgetown, South Carolina]].

It is mainly cultivated by small farmers in holdings of less than one [[hectare]]. Rice is also a wage commodity for workers in the cash crop or non-agricultural sectors. Rice is vital for the nutrition of much of the population in Asia, as well as in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Africa; it is central to the food security of over half the world population.\n\nMany rice grain producing countries have significant losses post-harvest at the farm and because of poor roads, inadequate storage technologies, inefficient supply chains and farmer's inability to bring the produce into retail markets dominated by small shopkeepers. A World Bank \u2013 FAO study claims 8% to 26% of rice is lost in developing nations, on average, every year, because of post-harvest problems and poor infrastructure.

At this point in the process, the product is called [[brown rice]]. The milling may be continued, removing the [[bran]], ''i.e.'', the rest of the husk and the [[cereal germ|germ]], thereby creating [[white rice]]. White rice, which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; moreover, in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, brown rice helps to prevent the [[disease]] [[beriberi]].\n\nEither by hand or in a [[rice polisher]], white rice may be buffed with glucose or [[talc]] powder (often called polished rice, though this term may also refer to white rice in general), [[parboiled rice|parboiled]], or processed into flour. White rice may also be enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.\n\nIn some countries, a popular form, [[parboiled rice]] (also known as '''converted rice''' and '''easy-cook rice'''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | title=Types of rice | publisher=Rice Association | access-date=August 2, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802162740/http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | archive-date=August 2, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>) is subjected to a steaming or [[parboiling]] process while still a brown rice grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, and the color of the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially [[thiamine]]) to move into the [[endosperm]], so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.\n\n[[Rice bran]], called ''nuka'' in Japan, is a valuable commodity in Asia and is used for many daily needs. It is a moist, oily inner layer which is heated to produce oil. It is also used as a pickling bed in making [[Nukazuke|rice bran pickles]] and ''[[takuan]]''.\n\nRaw rice may be ground into flour for many uses, including making many kinds of beverages, such as ''[[amazake]], [[horchata]]'', [[rice milk]], and [[rice wine]]. Rice does not contain [[gluten]], so is suitable for people on a [[gluten-free diet]].<ref name=PenaginiDilillo2013>{{cite journal|vauthors=Penagini F, Dilillo D, Meneghin F, Mameli C, Fabiano V, Zuccotti GV|title=Gluten-free diet in children: an approach to a nutritionally adequate and balanced diet|journal=Nutrients|volume=5|issue=11|pages=4553\u201365|date=Nov 18, 2013|pmid=24253052|pmc=3847748|doi=10.3390/nu5114553|type=Review}}</ref> Rice may also be made into various types of [[noodle]]s. Raw, wild, or brown rice may also be consumed by [[Raw foodism|raw-foodist]] or [[fruitarians]] if soaked and [[Sprouting|sprouted]] (usually a week to 30 days \u2013 gaba rice).\n\nProcessed rice seeds must be boiled or steamed before eating. Boiled rice may be further fried in [[cooking oil]] or butter (known as [[fried rice]]), or beaten in a tub to make ''[[mochi]]''.\n\nRice is a good source of protein and a staple food in many parts of the world, but it is not a [[complete protein]]: it does not contain all of the [[essential amino acids]] in sufficient amounts for good health, and should be combined with other sources of protein, such as nuts, seeds, beans, fish, or meat.<ref name=\"Protein content\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0378-4290(02)00006-0 | title=Estimating the amino acid composition in milled rice by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy | author=Jianguo G.

This process takes advantage of the grains' water content and typically involves heating grains in a special chamber. Further puffing is sometimes accomplished by processing puffed pellets in a low-[[pressure]] chamber. The [[ideal gas law]] means either lowering the local pressure or raising the water temperature results in an increase in [[volume]] prior to water [[evaporation]], resulting in a puffy [[Texture (food)|texture]]. Bulk raw rice density is about 0.9 g/cm\u00b3. It decreases to less than one-tenth that when puffed.\n\n===Harvesting, drying and milling===\n[[File:Rice-combine-harvester, Katori-city, Japan.jpg|thumb|Rice combine harvester [[Katori, Chiba|Katori-city]], [[Chiba Prefecture]], [[Japan]]]]\n[[File:Rice farmers Mae Wang Chiang Mai Province.jpg|thumb|After the harvest, rice straw is gathered in the traditional way from small paddy fields in [[Mae Wang District]], [[Chiang Mai Province]], [[Thailand]]]]\n{{Further|Paddy field}}\n<!-- [[Paddy]] and [[Padi]] link to this section -->\nUnmilled rice, known as \"paddy\" (Indonesia and Malaysia: padi; Philippines, palay), is usually harvested when the grains have a moisture content of around 25%. In most Asian countries, where rice is almost entirely the product of [[smallholder]] agriculture, harvesting is carried out manually, although there is a growing interest in mechanical harvesting. Harvesting can be carried out by the farmers themselves, but is also frequently done by seasonal labor groups. Harvesting is followed by [[threshing]], either immediately or within a day or two. Again, much threshing is still carried out by hand but there is an increasing use of mechanical threshers. Subsequently, paddy needs to be dried to bring down the moisture content to no more than 20% for milling.\n\nA familiar sight in several Asian countries is paddy laid out to dry along roads. However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families. Mills either sun dry or use mechanical driers or both. Drying has to be carried out quickly to avoid the formation of molds. Mills range from simple [[Rice huller|hullers]], with a throughput of a couple of tonnes a day, that simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tonnes a day and produce highly polished rice. A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72% but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60%. These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their own consumption.\n\n===Distribution===\nBecause of the importance of rice to human nutrition and food security in Asia, the domestic rice markets tend to be subject to considerable state involvement. While the private sector plays a leading role in most countries, agencies such as [[Indonesian Bureau of Logistics|BULOG]] in Indonesia, the [[National Food Authority (Philippines)|NFA]] in the Philippines, VINAFOOD in Vietnam and the [[Food Corporation of India]] are all heavily involved in purchasing of paddy from farmers or rice from mills and in distributing rice to poorer people. BULOG and NFA monopolise rice imports into their countries while VINAFOOD controls all exports from Vietnam.<ref>Shahidur Rashid, Ashok Gulari and Ralph Cummings Jnr (eds) (2008).

Although there was no shortage of rice on world markets this general upward trend in grain prices led to panic buying by consumers, government rice export bans (in particular, by Vietnam and India) and inflated import orders by the Philippines marketing board, the National Food Authority. This caused significant rises in rice prices.

For example, Thai [[Jasmine rice]] is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as some long-grain rice contains less [[amylopectin]] than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants often serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice though short-grain rice is common as well. Japanese [[mochigome|mochi rice]] and Chinese [[sticky rice]] are short-grain. Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as \"glutinous rice\" (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to \"gluten\") to make [[zongzi]]. The [[Japanese rice|Japanese table rice]] is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese [[sake]] rice is another kind as well.\n\nIndian rice cultivars include long-grained and aromatic [[Basmati]] (\u0a2c\u0a3e\u0a38\u0a2e\u0a24\u0a40) (grown in the North), long and medium-grained [[Patna rice]], and in South India ([[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]) short-grained [[Sona Masuri]] (also called as Bangaru theegalu). In the state of Tamil Nadu, the most prized cultivar is [[Ponni Rice|''ponni'']] which is primarily grown in the delta regions of the [[Kaveri]] River. [[Kaveri]] is also referred to as ponni in the South and the name reflects the geographic region where it is grown. In the Western Indian state of [[Maharashtra]], a short grain variety called [[Ambemohar]] is very popular. This rice has a characteristic fragrance of Mango blossom.\n\nAromatic rices have definite aromas and flavors; the most noted cultivars are Thai fragrant rice, Basmati, Patna rice, Vietnamese fragrant rice, and a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] cultivar from America, sold under the trade name Texmati. Both Basmati and Texmati have a mild [[popcorn]]-like aroma and flavor. In Indonesia, there are also ''red'' and ''black'' cultivars.\n\nHigh-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in Africa and other dry [[ecosystems]], called the [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]] (NERICA) cultivars, have been developed. It is hoped that their cultivation will improve [[food security]] in West Africa.\n\nDraft [[genomes]] for the two most common rice cultivars, ''indica'' and ''japonica'', were published in April 2002. Rice was chosen as a [[model organism]] for the biology of grasses because of its relatively small genome (~430 mega[[base pairs]]).

Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. In the presence of nitrogen fertilizers, and intensive crop management, these varieties increase their yield two to three times.\n\n=== Future potential ===\nAs the UN Millennium Development project seeks to spread global economic development to Africa, the \"Green Revolution\" is cited as the model for economic development. With the intent of replicating the successful Asian boom in agronomic productivity, groups like the [[Earth Institute]] are doing research on African agricultural systems, hoping to increase productivity. An important way this can happen is the production of \"[[New Rices for Africa]]\" (NERICA). These rices, selected to tolerate the low input and harsh growing conditions of African agriculture, are produced by the African Rice Center, and billed as technology \"from Africa, for Africa\". The NERICA have appeared in ''The New York Times'' (October 10, 2007) and ''International Herald Tribune'' (October 9, 2007), trumpeted as miracle crops that will dramatically increase rice yield in Africa and enable an economic resurgence.

Apart from this environmental benefit, the modification also increases the amount of rice grains by 43%, which makes it a useful tool in feeding a growing world population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Su|first1=J.|last2=Hu|first2=C.|last3=Yan|first3=X.|last4=Jin|first4=Y.|last5=Chen|first5=Z.|last6=Guan|first6=Q.|last7=Wang|first7=Y.|last8=Zhong|first8=D.|last9=Jansson|first9=C.|last10=Wang|first10=F.|last11=Schn\u00fcrer|first11=A.|last12=Sun|first12=C.|title=Expression of barley SUSIBA2 transcription factor yields high-starch low-methane rice|journal=Nature|date=July 22, 2015|volume=523|issue=7562|pages=602\u201306|doi=10.1038/nature14673|bibcode=2015Natur.523..602S|pmid=26200336}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gerry|title=Feeding the World One Genetically Modified Tomato at a Time: A Scientific Perspective|url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/feeding-the-world/|website=SITN|accessdate=September 11, 2015|date=2015-08-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910164510/http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/feeding-the-world/|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Meiosis and DNA repair==\nRice is used as a model organism for investigating the molecular mechanisms of meiosis and [[DNA repair]] in higher plants.

Since the 2014 season, the Cougars have played their home games on campus at [[TDECU Stadium]], which was built on the site formerly occupied by [[Robertson Stadium]], where they played home games from 1941 to 1950 and from 1997 to 2012.

The [[Rice Owls]] were an established program, having played since 1919 as a member of the [[Southwest Conference]]. In August 1945, the University of Houston announced that the school would field a football team for the first time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sports Shavings |date=August 23, 1945 |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |page=6}}</ref> Following the announcement, the [[Lone Star Conference]], spearheaded by [[Theron J.

Many of the married students lived on-campus at a makeshift village for World War II veterans, while some others lived in the university's recreation center in bunks for naval recruits training at UH during the war.<ref name=\"Eat Em Up\" /> Prior to joining the Cougars, Wallace served as head coach for [[Central High School (San Angelo, Texas)|San Angelo High School]]. During the spring training for the first team, Goyen and Valenti's petition was finally answered, as Coach Wallace arranged a small practice game between Rice and Houston.<ref name=\"Eat Em Up\" /> The meeting was to be at Rice. When the team arrived at the field in their practice uniforms, they realized that the game was much more serious. Officials were there, and the stadium was full of spectators. The game ended with Rice demolishing the Houston Cougars.

Ole Miss, UH's sponsor to the conference, had played the Cougars in their ninth game of the season, and although the Cougars lost, Ole Miss felt the team was worthwhile. The SEC decided to wait a year to determine whether UH would be a member of the conference. The 1956 season was thus an important one for the team. The Cougars won the Missouri Valley Conference title for the second time, and tied with the Southwest Conference's nationally ranked Texas A&M Aggies during their meeting. However, UH lost to both SEC scheduled teams during the season. Both Southwest Conference and Southeastern Conference bids by the Cougars were once again rejected.

His 160 victories rank 51st on the NCAA all-time list and make him the winningest coach in Cougar history. He used the [[Veer]] offense in 1964, an offense which he pioneered, and quickly helped lead the Cougars to national prominence. Yeoman's Cougars finished the season ranked in the top 5 twice, four times in the Top 10, and ten times in the Top 20. Yeoman is considered one of the all-time greatest college football coaches and led Houston to sustained success over his 25 years as head coach.\n\n[[File:Bill Yeoman coaching team.jpg|thumb|left|Yeoman coaching the Cougars on the sidelines]]\nIn 1964, Yeoman broke the color barrier for major Texas football programs when the University of Houston signed San Antonio's [[Warren McVea]] to a scholarship. On September 11, 1965, the Cougars played their first nationally televised game on [[NBC]] against [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|Tulsa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/hou/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/hou-09-mg-section8.pdf |title=On Television |accessdate=August 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nFor three straight years Houston led the nation in total offense, averaging 437 yards a game in 1966, 427 in 1967, and 562 in 1968. The 1968 total was an NCAA record at the time. Houston also led the nation in scoring with 42.5 points per game that year, including a 100\u20136 rattling of Tulsa that set several records for UH: largest point differential in a win (94), most points scored (100), and being the last team in Division I to date to score 100 points in a single game and the last in any NCAA division until Rockford College scored 105 in 2003.\n\nHe guided the Cougars to four [[Southwest Conference]] Championships\u20141976, 1978, 1979, and 1984\u2014and a 6\u20134\u20131 record in bowl games including [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] victories over the [[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland Terrapins]] in the 1976 season and the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska Cornhuskers]] in the 1979 season. In 1976, Houston's first year as a member of the SWC, Yeoman was named Texas Coach of the Year and runner-up for National Coach of the Year. Yeoman was elected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 2001 and the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 2003. He coached 46 All-Americans and 69 [[National Football League|NFL]] players. In 1978, the NCAA subdivided the Division I into Division I-A and Division I-AA with Houston being a part of the former (now known as Division I FBS).\n\nHowever, his career was not without controversy. In 1986, allegations surfaced regarding illegal recruiting inducements and extra benefits for his players. Due in part to these revelations, Yeoman was forced to retire at the end of the 1986 season after a 1\u201310 campaign.<ref name=NCAAReport>{{cite web|url=https://web1.ncaa.org/LSDBi/exec/miSearch?miSearchSubmit=publicReport&key=456&publicTerms=THIS+PHRASE+WILL+NOT+BE+REPEATED|title=Legislative Services Database - LSDBi|website=web1.ncaa.org}}</ref>\n\nYeoman is the longest-serving coach in Cougar history, having been with the team from 1962 to 1986. After retiring as head coach, Yeoman remained with the Cougars as a fundraiser, a position he still holds today.\n\n===Jack Pardee era (1987\u20131989)===\n[[File:Jack Pardee as Houston Cougars head football coach.jpg|thumb|[[Jack Pardee]] as head coach of the Houston Cougars]]\nFollowing Yeoman's retirement, Houston hired [[Jack Pardee]] to be the program's sixth head coach. Pardee was a former [[National Football League|NFL]] [[All-Pro]] [[linebacker]] who had previously held head coaching positions with the [[Chicago Bears]], [[Washington Redskins]] and the [[USFL]]'s [[Houston Gamblers]]. Pardee brought with him the [[Run & Shoot]] offense and a young offensive coordinator named [[John Jenkins (American football coach)|John Jenkins]]. The Run & Shoot offense was a strongly pass-oriented system that called for throwing the ball on most downs and in almost any situation. The Cougars would become one of the top offensive teams in the country during the Run & Shoot years.\n\nIn 1987, Pardee's first season, the team struggled in adjusting to the new system but scored a 60\u201340 home upset of the Texas Longhorns on the way to a 4\u20136\u20131 finish. The 1988 season saw great improvement in all aspects of team play with the Cougars posting a 9\u20133 mark, ultimately finishing 2nd in the Southwest Conference standings. The team played in the [[Aloha Bowl]] but fell 24\u201322 to Washington State. The Cougars' offense was led by quarterback [[Andre Ware]], who had been originally recruited to UH by [[Bill Yeoman]] as a Veer-option quarterback. UH finished the 1988 regular season at No. 18 in the AP Poll.\n\nIn 1988, the NCAA announced that it would levy sanctions against the Houston football program for numerous major rules violations during the Yeoman era.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/17/sports/football-houston-is-placed-on-probation.html |title=Houston Is Placed on Probation |date=December 17, 1988 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}</ref> The university was charged with around 250 violations and was assessed some of the most severe penalties for a program at the time.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968927,00.html |title=The N.C.A.A.

However, the most damaging penalty in the long run was a reduction to 15 scholarships for the 1989 season. Draconian as these penalties were, the NCAA said that they would have been even harsher (including being limited to 20 scholarships for 1990 and 50 paid recruiting visits for 1989) had Yeoman still been coach.<ref name=NCAAReport/> The lack of television exposure in 1989 was a setback but ultimately did not dampen the accolades UH would garner in a record-setting season.\n\n[[1989 Houston Cougars football team|The 1989 season]] was one of the most memorable in UH football history. Andre Ware continued his dramatic development as a passer and posted unprecedented passing statistics en route to winning the 1989 [[Heisman Trophy]]. Ware passed for 4,299 yards and threw 44 touchdown passes on the season. He posted one of his finest performances with 475 yards passing in the Cougars' 47\u20139 rout of archrival [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]] in the Astrodome. The Cougars set many offensive records during the season. The Cougars finished the 1989 season at 9\u20132 and 2nd in the Southwest Conference but could not go to a bowl game. UH finished the season ranked No. 14 in the AP poll.\n\nAfter the 1989 season, Pardee was hired as the head coach of the [[Houston Oilers]] and Jenkins was named his successor. The Pardee era at UH had been the most successful period in Cougar football since the late 1970s. The program enjoyed consistent success on the field, and helped to usher in the explosion of passing offense in college football. The Cougars' prolific offense and Andre Ware's Heisman Trophy raised the program to a level of national recognition that it had perhaps never enjoyed before. Pardee was later considered as a returning head coach for the Cougars after [[Art Briles]] left the program, but was eventually passed over in favor of [[Kevin Sumlin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=schlabach_mark&id=3158996 |title=Yellow Jackets, Wolverines, Midshipmen earn high marks |author=Schlabach, Mark |date=December 6, 2007 |publisher=ESPN |work=ESPN.com |accessdate=November 17, 2008}}</ref> Pardee had not coached since 1995.\n\n===John Jenkins era (1990\u20131992)===\nJenkins ascended to the helm at UH with a reputation as a brash, innovative young coach, considered by many the brains behind the high-powered [[Run & Shoot]] offense. Jenkins' offensive system reached its pinnacle in the 1990 season.\n\nLed by new quarterback [[David Klingler]], the Cougars' offense put up even more eye-popping numbers in the 1990 season than they had a year before. Klingler set a record by throwing 11 touchdown passes in a single game during an 84\u201321 rout of [[Eastern Washington University]] at the Astrodome. In a final-game victory over [[Arizona State Sun Devils football|Arizona State University]] in the [[Coca-Cola Classic (college football)|Coca-Cola Classic]] played in the [[Tokyo Dome]] in Tokyo, Japan, the two teams combined for 107 points and over 1,000 yards passing.\n\nThe Cougars achieved a high ranking of No.3 in the AP poll but fell out of national championship contention following a late-season loss to the No. 14 [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns]]. The Cougars finished the 1990 season with a 10\u20131 record and a No. 10 national ranking, again good for only 2nd in the conference standings. Klingler finished 3rd in Heisman balloting behind BYU's [[Ty Detmer]] and Notre Dame's [[Raghib Ismail]]. The program was serving its final season of probation and was again ineligible to play in a bowl game.\n\nDespite returning David Klingler and several other stars, the 1991 season saw a significant downturn from the Cougars' previous four-year arc of improvement. The season began in rousing fashion with a 73\u20133 home rout of [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]], but the second game marked what would in hindsight be the end of an era. In a game nationally televised on [[ESPN]] that had been billed as an intersectional meeting of powers, the Cougars faced the [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]] at the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]]. Miami blitzed early and often, keeping the Cougars' high-powered offense from getting any momentum. The Cougars not only lost the game 40\u201310, but also lost a good deal of the mystique surrounding their offense. The Cougars' other opponents repeated Miami's game plan of heavy blitzing. A week later against [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]] saw more of the same; they lost that contest 51\u201310. Although the Cougars beat [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]] for the fourth time in five years, they finished seventh in the conference with a 3\u20135 record and a 4\u20137 overall record. After the season, Klingler was selected No. 6 overall in the 1992 NFL draft, while defensive end [[Glenn Cadrez]] was picked No. 154 overall by the [[New York Jets]]. The 1991 season marked the start of what would be a decade-long fall from the successes of the late 1980s. From 1991 to 2004, the Cougars would have only three winning seasons.\n\nThe 1992 season saw the program continue its slide as the limited complement of scholarships for the 1989 season began to take their full effect. New quarterback [[Jimmy Klingler]] posted impressive performances against inferior competition, but the Cougars struggled against the better teams on the schedule. Jenkins increasingly came under fire for his teams' poor defensive performance and his propensity to \"[[run up the score]]\" in an unsportsmanlike manner against weaker opponents. The '92 season ended with the Cougars finishing 4\u20137 yet again.\n\nThe controversial Jenkins resigned under pressure on April 17, 1993 after a group of departing players including Trey Hooper, Tim Woods, Geoff Tait, [[Christopher Tuffin]] and star receiver Tracy Good contacted legendary sports columnist [[Dick Schaap]], who arranged for an investigative team from [[ESPN]] to look into long-rumored NCAA violations allegedly being committed by their former head coach (the story went on to win ESPN a 1993 Sports Emmy). Jenkins finished his tenure with an 18\u201315 overall record, though in his final two years he only won a total of eight games overall and five games in Southwest Conference play. In the chaos surrounding the sudden resignation of Jenkins, Houston athletic director [[BIll Carr (American football)|Bill Carr]] hired [[Los Angeles Raiders]] offensive line coach [[Kim Helton]] to become the eighth head coach in the history of the program.\n\n===Kim Helton era (1993\u20131999)===\n{{very long section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Kim Helton.jpg|thumb|Former Houston head coach [[Kim Helton]]]]\nAfter the controversy and NCAA sanctions of the late 1980s and early 1990s, the UH athletics administration was determined to remake the football program into one founded on sound discipline and transparency. The tough-talking, no-nonsense [[Kim Helton]], seemed to fit this need perfectly. Helton was nearly the diametric opposite of the brash, innovative John Jenkins. Where Jenkins believed in the primacy of passing offense above all else, Helton preached a hard-nosed brand of football centered on fundamentals that was a throwback to the 1970s.\n\nDespite returning all 11 starters on offense for the 1993 season, Helton discarded the high-powered Run & Shoot offense in favor of a more traditional run-based attack.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XzsKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=c0sDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4962%2C6540578 |title=Cougars Seek Help From Facility |newspaper=Victoria Advocate |date=August 31, 1994 |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}</ref> The personnel already in the program found it hard to adjust to the new system. Additionally, the team was still reeling from the loss of scholarships due to the sanctions imposed in 1988; the Cougars would not have a full complement of scholarships until 1994. The team struggled mightily under the weight of the offensive sea change and the scholarship limits. In Helton's first three seasons (1993\u201395), the Cougars limped to a combined 4\u201328\u20131 record for a winning percentage of just .125, including an 0\u201312 mark in nonconference play.\n\nHelton eschewed the program's long-time reliance on local talent and instead began heavily recruiting junior college players from Florida, Georgia and Mississippi. By doing so, Helton effectively severed the program's ties to the local high schools that had long been the lifeblood of UH football. Indeed, many local high school coaches claimed that they never even saw Helton during his seven-year tenure as head coach. This was a dramatic change for a program that had historically featured national powers built around Houston-area talent.\n\nIn 1994, four schools from the Southwest Conference announced they would join the members of the [[Big Eight Conference]] to form what would become the [[Big 12 Conference]]. Houston, along with [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]], [[SMU Mustangs football|SMU]], and [[Rice Owls football|Rice]], would not be invited to join the new conference. After over 80 years of SWC play including 21 successful years of UH membership, the SWC ceased to exist at the end of the 1995 season.\n\nUH joined the newly formed [[Conference USA]] for the 1996 season. In the inaugural season of C-USA play, led by future NFL running back [[Antowain Smith]] and quarterback Chuck Clements, the Cougars went 7\u20135\u2014their first winning season in six years. They also went 4\u20131 in conference play to win a share of the inaugural C-USA title, their first \"official\" conference title of any sort in 13 years. UH won that season's pivotal game against [[Southern Miss Golden Eagles football|Southern Miss]] 56\u201349 in overtime. As part of a new trend, the game was played at on-campus [[Robertson Stadium]] rather than at their long-time home, the [[Astrodome]]. The Cougars also played in their first bowl game since 1988, losing to No. 21 Syracuse 30\u201317 in the [[Liberty Bowl]].\n\nUH regressed to consecutive 3\u20138 records in the 1997 and 1998 seasons. In 1999, the Cougars went 7\u20134, scoring an impressive late-season win at [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]]. Four-year starter [[Ketric Sanford]] broke many Houston rushing records, but a 3\u20133 record in C-USA kept the Cougars out of a bowl. Despite the winning season, Helton was dismissed as head coach after the season. In his seven years at UH, Helton had compiled a 24\u201353 overall record.\n\nThe decade of the 1990s had not been a good one for UH football. Since the almost magical 10\u20131 season of 1990 in which they held a No. 3 ranking into November, the Cougars had since failed to crack the AP Top 25 and had gone to only one bowl game. The team's poor on-field performance had not been kind to fan interest. Attendance had slipped slowly downward throughout the decade, and the team often played in front of home crowds of fewer than 20,000 fans. Perhaps worst of all, Houston had lost major conference membership after the SWC collapse, and now were once again a mid-major team. The program also lacked stability in the athletic department after several changes at athletic director. Clearly, significant change was needed for the program to break out of its cycle of apathy. In a move to alleviate the financial burden of paying rent to the Astrodome's operators, Athletic Director [[Chet Gladchuk, Jr.|Chet Gladchuk]] began a drive to renovate Robertson Stadium to modern standards and move all home football games back to campus for the first time since the 1940s. This idea became a reality in the 1998 season, and significant renovations to the 60-year-old stadium were completed the following year.\n\nAlso in 1999, the [[Houston\u2013Rice rivalry]] was renewed after a three-year hiatus when the Southwest Conference disbanded. The Cougars defeated the Owls in that season's [[Bayou Bucket Classic]].\n\nHoping to inject vitality into the program on the field, UH hired the successful 37-year-old head coach of [[Wyoming Cowboys football|Wyoming]], [[Dana Dimel]], to take over the program in late 1999.\n\n===Dana Dimel era (2000\u20132002)===\nAfter coaching at Kansas State as an assistant under the legendary [[Bill Snyder]], [[Dana Dimel]] was selected as the 9th headman of the Houston Cougars after a successful stint as the head coach at Wyoming. Dimel took over the program with fan support at an all-time low. The program's relationship and standing with local high school coaches was also at a nadir as a result of Helton's often dismissive attitude toward local programs. As part of Dimel's rebuilding program, he vowed to bring back the aggressive passing attack that the Cougars had featured during the successful Pardee/Jenkins years.\n\nIn the 2000 season, the Cougars opened with a 3\u20134 stretch, but didn't win another game for the remainder of the season as they finished 3\u20138. During the off-season, Dimel brought in one of the program's best-rated recruiting classes in decades, and he began reestablishing positive relationships with local high school programs.\n\nDespite the positive attention surrounding Dimel's first recruiting class, the 2001 season was an unmitigated disaster. The Cougars went 0\u201311 on the season\u2014to date, the only winless campaign in the history of the program. Despite the poor season, Dimel again brought in the top-rated recruiting class in Conference USA. The class featured a number of players who would form the nucleus of future winning teams, players such as [[Jackie Battle]], [[Willie Gaston]], [[Will Gulley]] and [[Roshawn Pope]].\n\nThe Cougars fared better in the 2002 season, but new athletic director [[Dave Maggard]] made it clear that he expected significant progress in the program's performance on the field. Late in the year, with the Cougars holding a 4\u20137 record, Maggard informed Dimel that he would not be asked to return as head coach for the 2003 season. The final game of the 2002 season was a rousing 27\u201310 upset win over [[University of Louisville|Louisville]] that spoiled the [[Louisville Cardinals football|Cardinals']] chances of winning the conference title, but UH finished with a 5\u20137 record which was good for only 8th best in Conference USA. Despite landing some highly rated recruits, the Dimel era featured tremendous disappointment. Dimel had an 8\u201326 record in three years.\n\n===Art Briles era (2003\u20132007)===\nSeeking a sense of stability in the coaching staff, Athletic Director [[Dave Maggard]] began the search for a new head coach who would stay and build the program over the long term. To this end, Maggard began searching for coaches with close ties to UH and Texas football in general. The candidate who jumped to the fore was [[Art Briles]], a former Cougar player under Bill Yeoman and assistant at [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]]. Briles had earned a reputation as a top-flight offensive coach while the head coach at [[Stephenville High School]] of [[Stephenville, Texas]], where he led the team to multiple state titles running his unique version of the [[spread offense]]. Briles became the 10th head coach in Cougar football history, and the first former UH player to hold the position.\n\nBriles inherited a program that had lost its way on the field but was stocked with young talent from Dimel's exceptional recruiting classes. The Cougars had only won eight games in Dimel's three-year tenure, but things were about to change. In his first season, Briles led the Cougars to a 7\u20135 record and their first bowl appearance since the 1996 season. The Cougars lost the [[Sheraton Hawaii Bowl]] to the [[Hawaii Warriors football|Hawaii Warriors]] 54\u201348 in triple overtime on Christmas Day, 2003.\n\nAfter a successful inaugural season under Briles, the Cougars fell back to 3\u20138 in 2004. Briles guided the Cougars to a 6\u20136 season in 2005 and an appearance in the [[Fort Worth Bowl]]. The Cougars' hopes for a winning season were ended in a 42\u201313 bowl-game rout at the hands of the [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas Jayhawks]].\n\nThe 2006 season was the most successful for UH in over 15 years. Led by senior quarterback [[Kevin Kolb]], the Cougars romped to a 9\u20133 regular season record and a spot in the Conference USA Championship game against [[Southern Miss Golden Eagles football|Southern Miss]]. The Cougars hosted the nationally televised game at Robertson Stadium and won 34\u201320 to claim the school's second [[Conference USA|C-USA]] Championship and 10th conference title overall. The Cougars finished the season with a loss to the [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina Gamecocks]] in the [[Liberty Bowl]] that gave them a final won\u2013loss record of 10\u20134.\n\nIn 2007, the Cougars went 8\u20134 and finished second in the Conference USA West Division to the [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|Tulsa Golden Hurricane]]. In late November the Cougars accepted an invitation to the [[Texas Bowl]]. Two days later, Art Briles interviewed for the vacant [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor Bears]] head coaching position and was hired the next day. Despite criticism from many Houston fans, Briles promptly left Houston for Waco and did not return to coach the Cougars for their bowl game in December. Cornerbacks coach [[Chris Thurmond]] was named interim coach for the bowl game which the Cougars lost to [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]], 20\u201313.\n\nDespite the rancor surrounding the departure of Art Briles, his coaching tenure had been the most successful at UH since Jack Pardee departed for the NFL almost 20 years before. Briles had recruited well and coached his teams to on-field success, compiling a 34\u201328 record in his five seasons. More importantly, Briles had helped to return the program to respectability, most notably with the 2006 C-USA Championship. Briles's close ties with Texas high school coaches helped him to strengthen the program's ties to its primary talent base, and several of his players had been prominent selections in the NFL draft. Fan interest increased in the Briles era, and talk began of expanding Robertson Stadium beyond its current capacity. It is not too much to say that Art Briles brought the program to heights it had not seen since the 1980s.\n\n===Kevin Sumlin era (2008\u20132011)===\n{{very long section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Kevin Sumlin Close-up.jpg|thumb|Kevin Sumlin in 2008]]\nOn December 14, 2007, [[Kevin Sumlin]], a co-offensive coordinator for the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma Sooners]], was named as the Houston Cougars' 11th head football coach. Sumlin became the first [[African-American]] head coach in Cougar history, and the eighth in the NCAA's [[Football Bowl Subdivision]]. In his [[2007 Oklahoma Sooners football team|final year]] with the Sooners, his [[Offense (sports)|offense]] was one of the best in the country, averaging 44 points per game. Sumlin's first game made history at UH, as it drew the second-largest crowd ever at a home opener at Robertson Stadium.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://media.www.thedailycougar.com/media/storage/paper1206/news/2008/09/02/Sports/Cougars.Trample.Jaguars-3410792.shtml |title=Cougars trample Jaguars |author=Loh, Zaneta |newspaper=The Daily Cougar |date=September 2, 2008 |accessdate=September 2, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Topping Bill Meek's record, he scored the most points in Cougar history for a coaching debut.\n\nSumlin's first season in 2008 began with a rocky start as Houston lost consecutive games to Oklahoma State, Air Force, and Colorado State but rebounded to finish with a promising 8\u20135 record and achieved a bowl-game victory in a rematch with Air Force in the Armed Forces Bowl. The up-and-down 2008 season saw walk-on wide receiver [[Patrick Edwards]] suffer a horrifying injury during a road game against Marshall University as Edwards broke his leg colliding with Thundering Herd band carts inexplicably placed in the back of the Marshall end zone in Huntington, West Virginia. At the start of the 2008 season Coach Kevin Sumlin named sophomore [[Case Keenum]] as the starting quarterback for the Cougars and implemented a high-octane pass-based offense. Keenum would throw for over 5,000 yards that season. In 2008, under Coach Sumlin, Houston ended its twenty-eight-year bowl game losing streak as they won the [[2008 Armed Forces Bowl]]\n\nIn the 2009 season, the Cougars defeated Oklahoma State on the road in what was one of the most memorable Cougar football seasons ever. On September 12, 2009, the Sumlin-led Cougars defeated No. 5-ranked Oklahoma State in Stillwater to capture its first victory over a top-10 opponent in 21 years, and first victory over a top-5 opponent in 25 years. After defeating then-#5 Oklahoma State, the Cougars were ranked (No. 21 in the AP Top 25) for the first time since September 17, 1991. In the following game, in front of a sold-out crowd at Robertson Stadium, Houston would pull out yet another exciting win, this time over Texas Tech 29\u201328 following a furious final-minute comeback. In 2009, Houston went on to compile a 10\u20134 record that also featured a last-second come-from-behind victory at Tulsa and a win over Mississippi State from the SEC. Despite great success the 2009 season culminated with disappointment with losses to UCF and East Carolina in the C-USA Championship game, which was followed by an uninspired performance against Air Force in the Armed Forces Bowl. The Cougars continued to be nationally ranked throughout the majority of the 2009 season, reaching No. 12 in the major polls before losing their final two games. There was great promise as Houston was ranked to begin the 2010 season, having not seen a preseason ranking since the early 1990s. After the Cougars routed their first two opponents, star quarterback Case Keenum suffered a season-ending ACL injury, and backup QB Cotton Turner was also lost for the season, being injured in the same game against UCLA. The 2010 season resulted in a disappointing 5\u20137 record, but the NCAA granted quarterback Case Keenum a sixth year of eligibility, which allowed the record-setting passer to return for the 2011 season.\n\nKevin Sumlin led the Cougars to a national ranking at some point during each of the three consecutive seasons from 2009 to 2011. In 2011, after compiling a 12\u20130 record and reaching No. 6 in the BCS rankings, Houston was on the verge of becoming a so-called BCS buster, needing only a home win over Southern Mississippi in the C-USA Championship game to clinch a bid to the Sugar Bowl and a $17 million BCS Bowl payout. But the Sumlin-coached Cougars' dreams were dashed as the Golden Eagles defeated UH 49\u201328 at Robertson Stadium, amid rumors that Sumlin was already being courted for the head-coaching position at Texas A&M, which Sumlin denied. Sumlin was announced as the new head coach of [[Texas A&M University]] on December 10, 2011. The Kevin Sumlin era saw Houston return to prominence behind the arm of the NCAA's all-time leading passer, Case Keenum, and an air-raid offense designed by Offensive Coordinator Dana Holgorsen. As with Briles, under Coach Sumlin Houston was known for its offensive prowess, leading the NCAA in yards per game in 2009 and 2011 with a scoring average of over 50 points per game in the 2011 regular season. Houston scored over 70 points three times during Sumlin's tenure and broke numerous offensive passing records behind the NCAA's all-time leading passer, Case Keenum. Kevin Sumlin won more games in his first four seasons than any other Houston head coach in history, but this success was tempered by the Cougars' twice falling in the C-USA Championship game. Despite tremendous success, Sumlin's departure before completing the 2011 season, like Art Briles's in 2007, left many Houston fans with a bitter taste that was amplified by Sumlin's publicly insisting he intended to coach the 2012 season at Houston just hours before accepting the head coaching position at Texas A&M. In 2011, Houston finished the season 13\u20131 and was ranked in the final major-college football polls (No. 18 AP/ No. 14 USA Today Coaches, No. 19 BCS) for the first time since the 1990 season.\n\n===Tony Levine era (2011\u20132014)===\n{{very long section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Tony Levine.jpg|thumb|[[Tony Levine]]]]\n[[Tony Levine]] was named interim head coach for the 2012 TicketCity Bowl in which the Cougars defeated [[2011 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] 30\u201314. Following a ten-day coaching search during which eight candidates were considered, Levine was promoted to permanent head coach of the University of Houston football team. In his initial press conference, Levine indicated that Houston was his dream job, and, unlike Briles and Sumlin, he intended to make coaching UH football a long-term commitment. During his statement at his initial press conference, Coach Levine affirmed a commitment to continue the high-flying Houston spread offense of his predecessors while improving the defense, which had already shown some improvement in the 2011 season after underachieving for many years. While Houston had long been an offensive juggernaut, defense had also been a staple of Houston teams under Houston coach Bill Yeoman's so-called \"Mad Dog\" defenses. Houston announced that it would break ground in December 2012 on a new state-of-the-art football stadium.\n\nIn Levine's first full season as a head coach (2012), there were high expectations in Houston due to a bevy of returning starters on defense and offense. David Piland had been given the reins of the Houston offense at quarterback after the departure of Case Keenum. However, in the 2012 season opener for the Cougars, Houston suffered a crushing home loss to the [[2012 Texas State Bobcats football team|Texas State Bobcats]], who were playing in their first game as a Division I FBS team. In the fallout of the loss, coach [[Mike Nesbitt (American football)|Mike Nesbitt]] resigned his position as offensive coordinator for the Cougars. Assistant coach [[Travis Bush]] assumed play-calling duties for the Cougars for the rest of the season. The Cougars would finish the season at 5\u20137, miss out on a bowl bid, and suffer a defeat at SMU in which the Cougars allowed the most points to an opponent in school history and gave up a school record nine turnovers. What seemed a promising beginning to his coaching tenure with a bowl win at the end of the 2011 season had turned sour for Coach Levine during the 2012 season.\n\nThe 2013 season saw the turnaround that most Cougar fans were hoping for in Levine's second year and the Cougars began play in a new conference, the [[American Athletic Conference]]. Changes were made to the coaching staff, mainly at the coordinator positions as the Cougars were forced to play off campus at [[Reliant Stadium]] and [[BBVA Compass Stadium]] while the new stadium was built. Doug Meacham took over the offense and David Gibbs took over the defensive responsibilities. After shooting out to a 5\u20130 record, the Cougars regressed towards the end of the season, but managed to finish their season by defeating SMU 34\u20130, Houston's first shutout win since 1999. They finished the season 8\u20134 which garnered the Cougars a berth in the 2014 BBVA Compass Bowl versus Vanderbilt, where they lost 41\u201324. After the season, Doug Meacham left the program, making way for Travis Bush to take over as offensive coordinator. The Houston Cougars returned to campus and their new stadium, [[TDECU Stadium]], for the 2014 season.\n\nThe [[2014 Houston Cougars football team|2014 season]] would be a disaster in the eyes of the Cougar faithful. The long-awaited opening of TDECU Stadium was marred by a terrible loss to [[2014 UTSA Roadrunners football team|UTSA]]\u2014the latest in a series of embarrassing losses under Levine. The Cougars struggled out of the gate in 2014 going 2\u20133 with poor production on offense until [[Greg Ward, Jr.]] took over at the quarterback position. The Cougars would rebound, winning five of seven games to finish the season, primarily due to Ward's playmaking ability and the standout defense of Gibbs. Despite the turnaround, Levine would not be able to recover from the backlash of the home opener against UTSA, and on December 8, 2014, Levine was fired after three seasons of presiding over the Cougars.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2014/12/06/tony-levine-fired-houston-cougars|title=Houston coach Tony Levine has been fired after a 7-5 campaign|first=Thayer|last=Evans|publisher=}}</ref> The Cougars were invited to play in the [[Armed Forces Bowl]], where Defensive Coordinator David Gibbs was acting head coach.

The Cougars ended the regular season 9\u20133, with a second signature win over the fifth-ranked [[2016 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville Cardinals]] in mid-November. On November 26, 2016, it was announced that Herman would leave the University of Houston to take on the role of head football coach at the [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas at Austin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/18140313/texas-longhorns-hire-tom-herman-replace-charlie-strong|title=Longhorns hire Herman as Strong's replacement|publisher=}}</ref> Defensive Coordinator [[Todd Orlando]] was named Interim Head Coach that same day.\n\n===Major Applewhite era (2016\u20132018)===\n\nOn December 9, 2016, [[Major Applewhite]] was named head coach following the departure of Tom Herman. Applewhite had served as the Cougars' offensive coordinator under Herman. He was given a five-year contract.  Applewhite made his Houston coaching debut in the [[2016 Las Vegas Bowl|Las Vegas Bowl]] with a skeleton staff, which the Cougars lost to the [[2016 San Diego State Aztecs football team|San Diego State Aztecs]] by a score of 34\u201310.  Houston finished the 2016 season with a 9\u20134 record.\n\nThe 2017 Houston Cougar season saw fans hoping for the continued success that Herman had brought to Houston. [[Mark D'Onofrio]] was hired to replace the departed [[Todd Orlando]] at Defensive Coordinator, and [[Brian Johnson (American football coach)|Brian Johnson]] was hired as Offensive Coordinator. The opening game against [[2017 UTSA Roadrunners football team|UTSA]] was cancelled due to [[Hurricane Harvey]], which caused severe flooding and damage to the city of Houston and the Gulf Coast. The Cougars instead opened on the road against [[2017 Arizona Wildcats football team|Arizona]] winning in a low scoring game, 19\u201316. Low scoring would be a theme for the Cougars in 2017, as they struggled to continue the offensive output that the Cougars had historically been known for as a program. Coach Applewhite and staff struggled to find a suitable replacement for [[Greg Ward Jr.]], who had moved on to the Philadelphia Eagles. [[D'Eriq King]], who cemented himself as the starter after initially playing as a receiver/all-purpose player at the beginning of the season, supplanted Kyle Allen, and later Kyle Postma. The Cougars would finish 2017 at 7\u20134, having signature wins over Arizona and South Florida, but having suffered inexplicable losses to Tulsa and Tulane. The Cougars earned a bowl bid to the 2017 [[2017 Hawaii Bowl|Hawai'i Bowl]], where they lost to the resurgent [[2017 Fresno State Bulldogs football team|Fresno State Bulldogs]], 33\u201327. Coach Brian Johnson left his position as Offensive Coordinator after the regular season. In the end, Coach Applewhite's first season as a head coach left fans underwhelmed and hoping for better results in 2018.\n\nThe 2018 season saw Houston get off to a 7\u20131 start but ended with the Cougars losing four of their final five games, including a 70\u201314 blowout loss to [[2018 Army Black Knights football team|Army]] in the [[2018 Armed Forces Bowl|Armed Forces Bowl]]. On December 30, Houston fired Applewhite after two seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/houston-fires-coach-major-applewhite-after-just-two-seasons-with-the-cougars/|title=Houston fires coach Major Applewhite after just two seasons with the Cougars|website=cbssports.com|first=Barrett|last=Sallee|accessdate=December 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Dana Holgorsen era (2019\u2013present)===\n\nOn January 2, 2019, former [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] head coach [[Dana Holgorsen]] was named head coach following the firing of Major Applewhite.

The Cougars played in the [[Lone Star Conference]] for their first few seasons through 1948. The university then decided to leave for the [[Gulf Coast Conference]]. From 1951 to 1959 Houston played in the [[Missouri Valley Conference]]. In 1956, when the NCAA split into divisions, the team began playing as a part of the University Division (later known as [[NCAA Division I|Division I]]). From 1960 to 1976 the Houston Cougars were a major independent, achieving six straight final Top-25 finishes (eight total while independent) and five bowl appearances. In 1976, the Cougars began to play in their first athletic conference since 1959 when they joined the now-defunct [[Southwest Conference]]. The Cougars became the only Texas university to ever win a pre-existing conference in their first year, doing so [[1976 Houston Cougars football team|that same year]]. After the breakup of the SWC in 1996, Houston became a charter member of then newly formed [[Conference USA]].\n\nIn October 2011, Houston was extended an invitation to join the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] in all sports.<ref name=\"UH BE1\">{{cite web|last=Khan Jr|first=Sam|title=Big East votes to formally invite schools to conference|url=http://www.chron.com/sports/cougars/article/Big-East-formally-invites-schools-no-specific-2246748.php|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=November 21, 2011}}</ref> This invitation was significant because the Big East was an [[Automatic Qualifying conference]] in football, meaning that the conference champion automatically was invited to play in a lucrative BCS bowl. The invitation was motivated by the departures of Syracuse and Pittsburgh from the Big East to the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] and was part of an effort by the Big East to shore up its strength in football. The Board of Regents of the University of Houston voted to authorize Houston President Renu Khator to take whatever action she deemed beneficial regarding conference realignment. On December 7, 2011, the University of Houston was officially announced as one of the newest members of the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]], effective July 2013. However, [[2010\u201313 Big East Conference realignment|further membership turnover]] led to the Big East splitting into football-sponsoring and non-football conferences. The football-sponsoring conference, after selling the Big East name to the [[Big East Conference|non-football conference]], announced that it would operate as the [[American Athletic Conference]] after the split.\n\n* [[Lone Star Conference|Lone Star]] (1946\u20131948)\n* [[Gulf Coast Conference|Gulf Coast]] (1949\u20131950)\n* [[Missouri Valley Conference|Missouri Valley]] (1951\u20131959)\n* Independent (1960\u20131975)\n* [[Southwest Conference|Southwest]] (1976\u20131995)\n* [[Conference USA|C-USA]] (1996\u20132012)\n* [[American Athletic Conference|The American]] (2013\u2013present)\n\n==Championships==\n===Conference championships===\nThe Cougars have won 11 conference championships in their history, six of which were outright championships.

However, with the exception of occasional single games in the 1995 and 1996 seasons, the Cougars did not return to the stadium until the 1998 season following renovations. This remained their home stadium through the 2012 season; demolition began shortly afterwards to make way for a new stadium at the same site. From 2006 to 2011, the stadium was also home to Houston's [[Major League Soccer]] team, the [[Houston Dynamo]].\n\n===Houston Stadium \u2022 Rice Stadium===\n{{Main article|Rice Stadium (Rice University)}}\nIn 1951, [[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Houston Stadium]], later known as Rice Stadium, a stadium subsidized by the city of [[Houston]], opened.

In 1968, the [[Bluebonnet Bowl]] also changed its location to the stadium, and the Cougars regularly began to participate in the bowl.

The other two home games in 2013 were played at [[BBVA Compass Stadium]]. In 2016, Houston again played at NRG Stadium, where they defeated [[2016 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] in front of a crowd of 71,016.

Ole Miss, UH's sponsor to the conference, had played the Cougars in their ninth game of the season, and although the Cougars lost, Ole Miss felt the team was worthwhile. The SEC decided to wait a year to determine whether UH would be a member of the conference. The 1956 season was thus an important one for the team. The Cougars won the Missouri Valley Conference title for the second time, and tied with the Southwest Conference's nationally ranked Texas A&M Aggies during their meeting. However, UH lost to both SEC scheduled teams during the season. Both Southwest Conference and Southeastern Conference bids by the Cougars were once again rejected.

His 160 victories rank 51st on the NCAA all-time list and make him the winningest coach in Cougar history. He used the [[Veer]] offense in 1964, an offense which he pioneered, and quickly helped lead the Cougars to national prominence. Yeoman's Cougars finished the season ranked in the top 5 twice, four times in the Top 10, and ten times in the Top 20. Yeoman is considered one of the all-time greatest college football coaches and led Houston to sustained success over his 25 years as head coach.\n\n[[File:Bill Yeoman coaching team.jpg|thumb|left|Yeoman coaching the Cougars on the sidelines]]\nIn 1964, Yeoman broke the color barrier for major Texas football programs when the University of Houston signed San Antonio's [[Warren McVea]] to a scholarship. On September 11, 1965, the Cougars played their first nationally televised game on [[NBC]] against [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|Tulsa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/hou/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/hou-09-mg-section8.pdf |title=On Television |accessdate=August 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nFor three straight years Houston led the nation in total offense, averaging 437 yards a game in 1966, 427 in 1967, and 562 in 1968. The 1968 total was an NCAA record at the time. Houston also led the nation in scoring with 42.5 points per game that year, including a 100\u20136 rattling of Tulsa that set several records for UH: largest point differential in a win (94), most points scored (100), and being the last team in Division I to date to score 100 points in a single game and the last in any NCAA division until Rockford College scored 105 in 2003.\n\nHe guided the Cougars to four [[Southwest Conference]] Championships\u20141976, 1978, 1979, and 1984\u2014and a 6\u20134\u20131 record in bowl games including [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] victories over the [[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland Terrapins]] in the 1976 season and the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska Cornhuskers]] in the 1979 season. In 1976, Houston's first year as a member of the SWC, Yeoman was named Texas Coach of the Year and runner-up for National Coach of the Year. Yeoman was elected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 2001 and the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 2003. He coached 46 All-Americans and 69 [[National Football League|NFL]] players. In 1978, the NCAA subdivided the Division I into Division I-A and Division I-AA with Houston being a part of the former (now known as Division I FBS).\n\nHowever, his career was not without controversy. In 1986, allegations surfaced regarding illegal recruiting inducements and extra benefits for his players. Due in part to these revelations, Yeoman was forced to retire at the end of the 1986 season after a 1\u201310 campaign.<ref name=NCAAReport>{{cite web|url=https://web1.ncaa.org/LSDBi/exec/miSearch?miSearchSubmit=publicReport&key=456&publicTerms=THIS+PHRASE+WILL+NOT+BE+REPEATED|title=Legislative Services Database - LSDBi|website=web1.ncaa.org}}</ref>\n\nYeoman is the longest-serving coach in Cougar history, having been with the team from 1962 to 1986. After retiring as head coach, Yeoman remained with the Cougars as a fundraiser, a position he still holds today.\n\n===Jack Pardee era (1987\u20131989)===\n[[File:Jack Pardee as Houston Cougars head football coach.jpg|thumb|[[Jack Pardee]] as head coach of the Houston Cougars]]\nFollowing Yeoman's retirement, Houston hired [[Jack Pardee]] to be the program's sixth head coach. Pardee was a former [[National Football League|NFL]] [[All-Pro]] [[linebacker]] who had previously held head coaching positions with the [[Chicago Bears]], [[Washington Redskins]] and the [[USFL]]'s [[Houston Gamblers]]. Pardee brought with him the [[Run & Shoot]] offense and a young offensive coordinator named [[John Jenkins (American football coach)|John Jenkins]]. The Run & Shoot offense was a strongly pass-oriented system that called for throwing the ball on most downs and in almost any situation. The Cougars would become one of the top offensive teams in the country during the Run & Shoot years.\n\nIn 1987, Pardee's first season, the team struggled in adjusting to the new system but scored a 60\u201340 home upset of the Texas Longhorns on the way to a 4\u20136\u20131 finish. The 1988 season saw great improvement in all aspects of team play with the Cougars posting a 9\u20133 mark, ultimately finishing 2nd in the Southwest Conference standings. The team played in the [[Aloha Bowl]] but fell 24\u201322 to Washington State. The Cougars' offense was led by quarterback [[Andre Ware]], who had been originally recruited to UH by [[Bill Yeoman]] as a Veer-option quarterback. UH finished the 1988 regular season at No. 18 in the AP Poll.\n\nIn 1988, the NCAA announced that it would levy sanctions against the Houston football program for numerous major rules violations during the Yeoman era.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/17/sports/football-houston-is-placed-on-probation.html |title=Houston Is Placed on Probation |date=December 17, 1988 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}</ref> The university was charged with around 250 violations and was assessed some of the most severe penalties for a program at the time.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968927,00.html |title=The N.C.A.A.

However, the most damaging penalty in the long run was a reduction to 15 scholarships for the 1989 season. Draconian as these penalties were, the NCAA said that they would have been even harsher (including being limited to 20 scholarships for 1990 and 50 paid recruiting visits for 1989) had Yeoman still been coach.<ref name=NCAAReport/> The lack of television exposure in 1989 was a setback but ultimately did not dampen the accolades UH would garner in a record-setting season.\n\n[[1989 Houston Cougars football team|The 1989 season]] was one of the most memorable in UH football history. Andre Ware continued his dramatic development as a passer and posted unprecedented passing statistics en route to winning the 1989 [[Heisman Trophy]]. Ware passed for 4,299 yards and threw 44 touchdown passes on the season. He posted one of his finest performances with 475 yards passing in the Cougars' 47\u20139 rout of archrival [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]] in the Astrodome. The Cougars set many offensive records during the season. The Cougars finished the 1989 season at 9\u20132 and 2nd in the Southwest Conference but could not go to a bowl game. UH finished the season ranked No. 14 in the AP poll.\n\nAfter the 1989 season, Pardee was hired as the head coach of the [[Houston Oilers]] and Jenkins was named his successor. The Pardee era at UH had been the most successful period in Cougar football since the late 1970s. The program enjoyed consistent success on the field, and helped to usher in the explosion of passing offense in college football. The Cougars' prolific offense and Andre Ware's Heisman Trophy raised the program to a level of national recognition that it had perhaps never enjoyed before. Pardee was later considered as a returning head coach for the Cougars after [[Art Briles]] left the program, but was eventually passed over in favor of [[Kevin Sumlin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=schlabach_mark&id=3158996 |title=Yellow Jackets, Wolverines, Midshipmen earn high marks |author=Schlabach, Mark |date=December 6, 2007 |publisher=ESPN |work=ESPN.com |accessdate=November 17, 2008}}</ref> Pardee had not coached since 1995.\n\n===John Jenkins era (1990\u20131992)===\nJenkins ascended to the helm at UH with a reputation as a brash, innovative young coach, considered by many the brains behind the high-powered [[Run & Shoot]] offense. Jenkins' offensive system reached its pinnacle in the 1990 season.\n\nLed by new quarterback [[David Klingler]], the Cougars' offense put up even more eye-popping numbers in the 1990 season than they had a year before. Klingler set a record by throwing 11 touchdown passes in a single game during an 84\u201321 rout of [[Eastern Washington University]] at the Astrodome. In a final-game victory over [[Arizona State Sun Devils football|Arizona State University]] in the [[Coca-Cola Classic (college football)|Coca-Cola Classic]] played in the [[Tokyo Dome]] in Tokyo, Japan, the two teams combined for 107 points and over 1,000 yards passing.\n\nThe Cougars achieved a high ranking of No.3 in the AP poll but fell out of national championship contention following a late-season loss to the No. 14 [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns]]. The Cougars finished the 1990 season with a 10\u20131 record and a No. 10 national ranking, again good for only 2nd in the conference standings. Klingler finished 3rd in Heisman balloting behind BYU's [[Ty Detmer]] and Notre Dame's [[Raghib Ismail]]. The program was serving its final season of probation and was again ineligible to play in a bowl game.\n\nDespite returning David Klingler and several other stars, the 1991 season saw a significant downturn from the Cougars' previous four-year arc of improvement. The season began in rousing fashion with a 73\u20133 home rout of [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]], but the second game marked what would in hindsight be the end of an era. In a game nationally televised on [[ESPN]] that had been billed as an intersectional meeting of powers, the Cougars faced the [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]] at the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]]. Miami blitzed early and often, keeping the Cougars' high-powered offense from getting any momentum. The Cougars not only lost the game 40\u201310, but also lost a good deal of the mystique surrounding their offense. The Cougars' other opponents repeated Miami's game plan of heavy blitzing. A week later against [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]] saw more of the same; they lost that contest 51\u201310. Although the Cougars beat [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]] for the fourth time in five years, they finished seventh in the conference with a 3\u20135 record and a 4\u20137 overall record. After the season, Klingler was selected No. 6 overall in the 1992 NFL draft, while defensive end [[Glenn Cadrez]] was picked No. 154 overall by the [[New York Jets]]. The 1991 season marked the start of what would be a decade-long fall from the successes of the late 1980s. From 1991 to 2004, the Cougars would have only three winning seasons.\n\nThe 1992 season saw the program continue its slide as the limited complement of scholarships for the 1989 season began to take their full effect. New quarterback [[Jimmy Klingler]] posted impressive performances against inferior competition, but the Cougars struggled against the better teams on the schedule. Jenkins increasingly came under fire for his teams' poor defensive performance and his propensity to \"[[run up the score]]\" in an unsportsmanlike manner against weaker opponents. The '92 season ended with the Cougars finishing 4\u20137 yet again.\n\nThe controversial Jenkins resigned under pressure on April 17, 1993 after a group of departing players including Trey Hooper, Tim Woods, Geoff Tait, [[Christopher Tuffin]] and star receiver Tracy Good contacted legendary sports columnist [[Dick Schaap]], who arranged for an investigative team from [[ESPN]] to look into long-rumored NCAA violations allegedly being committed by their former head coach (the story went on to win ESPN a 1993 Sports Emmy). Jenkins finished his tenure with an 18\u201315 overall record, though in his final two years he only won a total of eight games overall and five games in Southwest Conference play. In the chaos surrounding the sudden resignation of Jenkins, Houston athletic director [[BIll Carr (American football)|Bill Carr]] hired [[Los Angeles Raiders]] offensive line coach [[Kim Helton]] to become the eighth head coach in the history of the program.\n\n===Kim Helton era (1993\u20131999)===\n{{very long section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Kim Helton.jpg|thumb|Former Houston head coach [[Kim Helton]]]]\nAfter the controversy and NCAA sanctions of the late 1980s and early 1990s, the UH athletics administration was determined to remake the football program into one founded on sound discipline and transparency. The tough-talking, no-nonsense [[Kim Helton]], seemed to fit this need perfectly. Helton was nearly the diametric opposite of the brash, innovative John Jenkins. Where Jenkins believed in the primacy of passing offense above all else, Helton preached a hard-nosed brand of football centered on fundamentals that was a throwback to the 1970s.\n\nDespite returning all 11 starters on offense for the 1993 season, Helton discarded the high-powered Run & Shoot offense in favor of a more traditional run-based attack.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XzsKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=c0sDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4962%2C6540578 |title=Cougars Seek Help From Facility |newspaper=Victoria Advocate |date=August 31, 1994 |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}</ref> The personnel already in the program found it hard to adjust to the new system. Additionally, the team was still reeling from the loss of scholarships due to the sanctions imposed in 1988; the Cougars would not have a full complement of scholarships until 1994. The team struggled mightily under the weight of the offensive sea change and the scholarship limits. In Helton's first three seasons (1993\u201395), the Cougars limped to a combined 4\u201328\u20131 record for a winning percentage of just .125, including an 0\u201312 mark in nonconference play.\n\nHelton eschewed the program's long-time reliance on local talent and instead began heavily recruiting junior college players from Florida, Georgia and Mississippi. By doing so, Helton effectively severed the program's ties to the local high schools that had long been the lifeblood of UH football. Indeed, many local high school coaches claimed that they never even saw Helton during his seven-year tenure as head coach. This was a dramatic change for a program that had historically featured national powers built around Houston-area talent.\n\nIn 1994, four schools from the Southwest Conference announced they would join the members of the [[Big Eight Conference]] to form what would become the [[Big 12 Conference]]. Houston, along with [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]], [[SMU Mustangs football|SMU]], and [[Rice Owls football|Rice]], would not be invited to join the new conference. After over 80 years of SWC play including 21 successful years of UH membership, the SWC ceased to exist at the end of the 1995 season.\n\nUH joined the newly formed [[Conference USA]] for the 1996 season. In the inaugural season of C-USA play, led by future NFL running back [[Antowain Smith]] and quarterback Chuck Clements, the Cougars went 7\u20135\u2014their first winning season in six years. They also went 4\u20131 in conference play to win a share of the inaugural C-USA title, their first \"official\" conference title of any sort in 13 years. UH won that season's pivotal game against [[Southern Miss Golden Eagles football|Southern Miss]] 56\u201349 in overtime. As part of a new trend, the game was played at on-campus [[Robertson Stadium]] rather than at their long-time home, the [[Astrodome]]. The Cougars also played in their first bowl game since 1988, losing to No. 21 Syracuse 30\u201317 in the [[Liberty Bowl]].\n\nUH regressed to consecutive 3\u20138 records in the 1997 and 1998 seasons. In 1999, the Cougars went 7\u20134, scoring an impressive late-season win at [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]]. Four-year starter [[Ketric Sanford]] broke many Houston rushing records, but a 3\u20133 record in C-USA kept the Cougars out of a bowl. Despite the winning season, Helton was dismissed as head coach after the season. In his seven years at UH, Helton had compiled a 24\u201353 overall record.\n\nThe decade of the 1990s had not been a good one for UH football. Since the almost magical 10\u20131 season of 1990 in which they held a No. 3 ranking into November, the Cougars had since failed to crack the AP Top 25 and had gone to only one bowl game. The team's poor on-field performance had not been kind to fan interest. Attendance had slipped slowly downward throughout the decade, and the team often played in front of home crowds of fewer than 20,000 fans. Perhaps worst of all, Houston had lost major conference membership after the SWC collapse, and now were once again a mid-major team. The program also lacked stability in the athletic department after several changes at athletic director. Clearly, significant change was needed for the program to break out of its cycle of apathy. In a move to alleviate the financial burden of paying rent to the Astrodome's operators, Athletic Director [[Chet Gladchuk, Jr.|Chet Gladchuk]] began a drive to renovate Robertson Stadium to modern standards and move all home football games back to campus for the first time since the 1940s. This idea became a reality in the 1998 season, and significant renovations to the 60-year-old stadium were completed the following year.\n\nAlso in 1999, the [[Houston\u2013Rice rivalry]] was renewed after a three-year hiatus when the Southwest Conference disbanded. The Cougars defeated the Owls in that season's [[Bayou Bucket Classic]].\n\nHoping to inject vitality into the program on the field, UH hired the successful 37-year-old head coach of [[Wyoming Cowboys football|Wyoming]], [[Dana Dimel]], to take over the program in late 1999.\n\n===Dana Dimel era (2000\u20132002)===\nAfter coaching at Kansas State as an assistant under the legendary [[Bill Snyder]], [[Dana Dimel]] was selected as the 9th headman of the Houston Cougars after a successful stint as the head coach at Wyoming. Dimel took over the program with fan support at an all-time low. The program's relationship and standing with local high school coaches was also at a nadir as a result of Helton's often dismissive attitude toward local programs. As part of Dimel's rebuilding program, he vowed to bring back the aggressive passing attack that the Cougars had featured during the successful Pardee/Jenkins years.\n\nIn the 2000 season, the Cougars opened with a 3\u20134 stretch, but didn't win another game for the remainder of the season as they finished 3\u20138. During the off-season, Dimel brought in one of the program's best-rated recruiting classes in decades, and he began reestablishing positive relationships with local high school programs.\n\nDespite the positive attention surrounding Dimel's first recruiting class, the 2001 season was an unmitigated disaster. The Cougars went 0\u201311 on the season\u2014to date, the only winless campaign in the history of the program. Despite the poor season, Dimel again brought in the top-rated recruiting class in Conference USA. The class featured a number of players who would form the nucleus of future winning teams, players such as [[Jackie Battle]], [[Willie Gaston]], [[Will Gulley]] and [[Roshawn Pope]].\n\nThe Cougars fared better in the 2002 season, but new athletic director [[Dave Maggard]] made it clear that he expected significant progress in the program's performance on the field. Late in the year, with the Cougars holding a 4\u20137 record, Maggard informed Dimel that he would not be asked to return as head coach for the 2003 season. The final game of the 2002 season was a rousing 27\u201310 upset win over [[University of Louisville|Louisville]] that spoiled the [[Louisville Cardinals football|Cardinals']] chances of winning the conference title, but UH finished with a 5\u20137 record which was good for only 8th best in Conference USA. Despite landing some highly rated recruits, the Dimel era featured tremendous disappointment. Dimel had an 8\u201326 record in three years.\n\n===Art Briles era (2003\u20132007)===\nSeeking a sense of stability in the coaching staff, Athletic Director [[Dave Maggard]] began the search for a new head coach who would stay and build the program over the long term. To this end, Maggard began searching for coaches with close ties to UH and Texas football in general. The candidate who jumped to the fore was [[Art Briles]], a former Cougar player under Bill Yeoman and assistant at [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]]. Briles had earned a reputation as a top-flight offensive coach while the head coach at [[Stephenville High School]] of [[Stephenville, Texas]], where he led the team to multiple state titles running his unique version of the [[spread offense]]. Briles became the 10th head coach in Cougar football history, and the first former UH player to hold the position.\n\nBriles inherited a program that had lost its way on the field but was stocked with young talent from Dimel's exceptional recruiting classes. The Cougars had only won eight games in Dimel's three-year tenure, but things were about to change. In his first season, Briles led the Cougars to a 7\u20135 record and their first bowl appearance since the 1996 season. The Cougars lost the [[Sheraton Hawaii Bowl]] to the [[Hawaii Warriors football|Hawaii Warriors]] 54\u201348 in triple overtime on Christmas Day, 2003.\n\nAfter a successful inaugural season under Briles, the Cougars fell back to 3\u20138 in 2004. Briles guided the Cougars to a 6\u20136 season in 2005 and an appearance in the [[Fort Worth Bowl]]. The Cougars' hopes for a winning season were ended in a 42\u201313 bowl-game rout at the hands of the [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas Jayhawks]].\n\nThe 2006 season was the most successful for UH in over 15 years. Led by senior quarterback [[Kevin Kolb]], the Cougars romped to a 9\u20133 regular season record and a spot in the Conference USA Championship game against [[Southern Miss Golden Eagles football|Southern Miss]]. The Cougars hosted the nationally televised game at Robertson Stadium and won 34\u201320 to claim the school's second [[Conference USA|C-USA]] Championship and 10th conference title overall. The Cougars finished the season with a loss to the [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina Gamecocks]] in the [[Liberty Bowl]] that gave them a final won\u2013loss record of 10\u20134.\n\nIn 2007, the Cougars went 8\u20134 and finished second in the Conference USA West Division to the [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|Tulsa Golden Hurricane]]. In late November the Cougars accepted an invitation to the [[Texas Bowl]]. Two days later, Art Briles interviewed for the vacant [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor Bears]] head coaching position and was hired the next day. Despite criticism from many Houston fans, Briles promptly left Houston for Waco and did not return to coach the Cougars for their bowl game in December. Cornerbacks coach [[Chris Thurmond]] was named interim coach for the bowl game which the Cougars lost to [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]], 20\u201313.\n\nDespite the rancor surrounding the departure of Art Briles, his coaching tenure had been the most successful at UH since Jack Pardee departed for the NFL almost 20 years before. Briles had recruited well and coached his teams to on-field success, compiling a 34\u201328 record in his five seasons. More importantly, Briles had helped to return the program to respectability, most notably with the 2006 C-USA Championship. Briles's close ties with Texas high school coaches helped him to strengthen the program's ties to its primary talent base, and several of his players had been prominent selections in the NFL draft. Fan interest increased in the Briles era, and talk began of expanding Robertson Stadium beyond its current capacity. It is not too much to say that Art Briles brought the program to heights it had not seen since the 1980s.\n\n===Kevin Sumlin era (2008\u20132011)===\n{{very long section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Kevin Sumlin Close-up.jpg|thumb|Kevin Sumlin in 2008]]\nOn December 14, 2007, [[Kevin Sumlin]], a co-offensive coordinator for the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma Sooners]], was named as the Houston Cougars' 11th head football coach. Sumlin became the first [[African-American]] head coach in Cougar history, and the eighth in the NCAA's [[Football Bowl Subdivision]]. In his [[2007 Oklahoma Sooners football team|final year]] with the Sooners, his [[Offense (sports)|offense]] was one of the best in the country, averaging 44 points per game. Sumlin's first game made history at UH, as it drew the second-largest crowd ever at a home opener at Robertson Stadium.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://media.www.thedailycougar.com/media/storage/paper1206/news/2008/09/02/Sports/Cougars.Trample.Jaguars-3410792.shtml |title=Cougars trample Jaguars |author=Loh, Zaneta |newspaper=The Daily Cougar |date=September 2, 2008 |accessdate=September 2, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Topping Bill Meek's record, he scored the most points in Cougar history for a coaching debut.\n\nSumlin's first season in 2008 began with a rocky start as Houston lost consecutive games to Oklahoma State, Air Force, and Colorado State but rebounded to finish with a promising 8\u20135 record and achieved a bowl-game victory in a rematch with Air Force in the Armed Forces Bowl. The up-and-down 2008 season saw walk-on wide receiver [[Patrick Edwards]] suffer a horrifying injury during a road game against Marshall University as Edwards broke his leg colliding with Thundering Herd band carts inexplicably placed in the back of the Marshall end zone in Huntington, West Virginia. At the start of the 2008 season Coach Kevin Sumlin named sophomore [[Case Keenum]] as the starting quarterback for the Cougars and implemented a high-octane pass-based offense. Keenum would throw for over 5,000 yards that season. In 2008, under Coach Sumlin, Houston ended its twenty-eight-year bowl game losing streak as they won the [[2008 Armed Forces Bowl]]\n\nIn the 2009 season, the Cougars defeated Oklahoma State on the road in what was one of the most memorable Cougar football seasons ever. On September 12, 2009, the Sumlin-led Cougars defeated No. 5-ranked Oklahoma State in Stillwater to capture its first victory over a top-10 opponent in 21 years, and first victory over a top-5 opponent in 25 years. After defeating then-#5 Oklahoma State, the Cougars were ranked (No. 21 in the AP Top 25) for the first time since September 17, 1991. In the following game, in front of a sold-out crowd at Robertson Stadium, Houston would pull out yet another exciting win, this time over Texas Tech 29\u201328 following a furious final-minute comeback. In 2009, Houston went on to compile a 10\u20134 record that also featured a last-second come-from-behind victory at Tulsa and a win over Mississippi State from the SEC. Despite great success the 2009 season culminated with disappointment with losses to UCF and East Carolina in the C-USA Championship game, which was followed by an uninspired performance against Air Force in the Armed Forces Bowl. The Cougars continued to be nationally ranked throughout the majority of the 2009 season, reaching No. 12 in the major polls before losing their final two games. There was great promise as Houston was ranked to begin the 2010 season, having not seen a preseason ranking since the early 1990s. After the Cougars routed their first two opponents, star quarterback Case Keenum suffered a season-ending ACL injury, and backup QB Cotton Turner was also lost for the season, being injured in the same game against UCLA. The 2010 season resulted in a disappointing 5\u20137 record, but the NCAA granted quarterback Case Keenum a sixth year of eligibility, which allowed the record-setting passer to return for the 2011 season.\n\nKevin Sumlin led the Cougars to a national ranking at some point during each of the three consecutive seasons from 2009 to 2011. In 2011, after compiling a 12\u20130 record and reaching No. 6 in the BCS rankings, Houston was on the verge of becoming a so-called BCS buster, needing only a home win over Southern Mississippi in the C-USA Championship game to clinch a bid to the Sugar Bowl and a $17 million BCS Bowl payout. But the Sumlin-coached Cougars' dreams were dashed as the Golden Eagles defeated UH 49\u201328 at Robertson Stadium, amid rumors that Sumlin was already being courted for the head-coaching position at Texas A&M, which Sumlin denied. Sumlin was announced as the new head coach of [[Texas A&M University]] on December 10, 2011. The Kevin Sumlin era saw Houston return to prominence behind the arm of the NCAA's all-time leading passer, Case Keenum, and an air-raid offense designed by Offensive Coordinator Dana Holgorsen. As with Briles, under Coach Sumlin Houston was known for its offensive prowess, leading the NCAA in yards per game in 2009 and 2011 with a scoring average of over 50 points per game in the 2011 regular season. Houston scored over 70 points three times during Sumlin's tenure and broke numerous offensive passing records behind the NCAA's all-time leading passer, Case Keenum. Kevin Sumlin won more games in his first four seasons than any other Houston head coach in history, but this success was tempered by the Cougars' twice falling in the C-USA Championship game. Despite tremendous success, Sumlin's departure before completing the 2011 season, like Art Briles's in 2007, left many Houston fans with a bitter taste that was amplified by Sumlin's publicly insisting he intended to coach the 2012 season at Houston just hours before accepting the head coaching position at Texas A&M. In 2011, Houston finished the season 13\u20131 and was ranked in the final major-college football polls (No. 18 AP/ No. 14 USA Today Coaches, No. 19 BCS) for the first time since the 1990 season.\n\n===Tony Levine era (2011\u20132014)===\n{{very long section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Tony Levine.jpg|thumb|[[Tony Levine]]]]\n[[Tony Levine]] was named interim head coach for the 2012 TicketCity Bowl in which the Cougars defeated [[2011 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] 30\u201314. Following a ten-day coaching search during which eight candidates were considered, Levine was promoted to permanent head coach of the University of Houston football team. In his initial press conference, Levine indicated that Houston was his dream job, and, unlike Briles and Sumlin, he intended to make coaching UH football a long-term commitment. During his statement at his initial press conference, Coach Levine affirmed a commitment to continue the high-flying Houston spread offense of his predecessors while improving the defense, which had already shown some improvement in the 2011 season after underachieving for many years. While Houston had long been an offensive juggernaut, defense had also been a staple of Houston teams under Houston coach Bill Yeoman's so-called \"Mad Dog\" defenses. Houston announced that it would break ground in December 2012 on a new state-of-the-art football stadium.\n\nIn Levine's first full season as a head coach (2012), there were high expectations in Houston due to a bevy of returning starters on defense and offense. David Piland had been given the reins of the Houston offense at quarterback after the departure of Case Keenum. However, in the 2012 season opener for the Cougars, Houston suffered a crushing home loss to the [[2012 Texas State Bobcats football team|Texas State Bobcats]], who were playing in their first game as a Division I FBS team. In the fallout of the loss, coach [[Mike Nesbitt (American football)|Mike Nesbitt]] resigned his position as offensive coordinator for the Cougars. Assistant coach [[Travis Bush]] assumed play-calling duties for the Cougars for the rest of the season. The Cougars would finish the season at 5\u20137, miss out on a bowl bid, and suffer a defeat at SMU in which the Cougars allowed the most points to an opponent in school history and gave up a school record nine turnovers. What seemed a promising beginning to his coaching tenure with a bowl win at the end of the 2011 season had turned sour for Coach Levine during the 2012 season.\n\nThe 2013 season saw the turnaround that most Cougar fans were hoping for in Levine's second year and the Cougars began play in a new conference, the [[American Athletic Conference]]. Changes were made to the coaching staff, mainly at the coordinator positions as the Cougars were forced to play off campus at [[Reliant Stadium]] and [[BBVA Compass Stadium]] while the new stadium was built. Doug Meacham took over the offense and David Gibbs took over the defensive responsibilities. After shooting out to a 5\u20130 record, the Cougars regressed towards the end of the season, but managed to finish their season by defeating SMU 34\u20130, Houston's first shutout win since 1999. They finished the season 8\u20134 which garnered the Cougars a berth in the 2014 BBVA Compass Bowl versus Vanderbilt, where they lost 41\u201324. After the season, Doug Meacham left the program, making way for Travis Bush to take over as offensive coordinator. The Houston Cougars returned to campus and their new stadium, [[TDECU Stadium]], for the 2014 season.\n\nThe [[2014 Houston Cougars football team|2014 season]] would be a disaster in the eyes of the Cougar faithful. The long-awaited opening of TDECU Stadium was marred by a terrible loss to [[2014 UTSA Roadrunners football team|UTSA]]\u2014the latest in a series of embarrassing losses under Levine. The Cougars struggled out of the gate in 2014 going 2\u20133 with poor production on offense until [[Greg Ward, Jr.]] took over at the quarterback position. The Cougars would rebound, winning five of seven games to finish the season, primarily due to Ward's playmaking ability and the standout defense of Gibbs. Despite the turnaround, Levine would not be able to recover from the backlash of the home opener against UTSA, and on December 8, 2014, Levine was fired after three seasons of presiding over the Cougars.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2014/12/06/tony-levine-fired-houston-cougars|title=Houston coach Tony Levine has been fired after a 7-5 campaign|first=Thayer|last=Evans|publisher=}}</ref> The Cougars were invited to play in the [[Armed Forces Bowl]], where Defensive Coordinator David Gibbs was acting head coach. The Cougars played the Pitt Panthers, who also were under an interim head coach.

Applewhite had served as the Cougars' offensive coordinator under Herman. He was given a five-year contract.  Applewhite made his Houston coaching debut in the [[2016 Las Vegas Bowl|Las Vegas Bowl]] with a skeleton staff, which the Cougars lost to the [[2016 San Diego State Aztecs football team|San Diego State Aztecs]] by a score of 34\u201310.  Houston finished the 2016 season with a 9\u20134 record.\n\nThe 2017 Houston Cougar season saw fans hoping for the continued success that Herman had brought to Houston. [[Mark D'Onofrio]] was hired to replace the departed [[Todd Orlando]] at Defensive Coordinator, and [[Brian Johnson (American football coach)|Brian Johnson]] was hired as Offensive Coordinator. The opening game against [[2017 UTSA Roadrunners football team|UTSA]] was cancelled due to [[Hurricane Harvey]], which caused severe flooding and damage to the city of Houston and the Gulf Coast. The Cougars instead opened on the road against [[2017 Arizona Wildcats football team|Arizona]] winning in a low scoring game, 19\u201316. Low scoring would be a theme for the Cougars in 2017, as they struggled to continue the offensive output that the Cougars had historically been known for as a program. Coach Applewhite and staff struggled to find a suitable replacement for [[Greg Ward Jr.]], who had moved on to the Philadelphia Eagles. [[D'Eriq King]], who cemented himself as the starter after initially playing as a receiver/all-purpose player at the beginning of the season, supplanted Kyle Allen, and later Kyle Postma. The Cougars would finish 2017 at 7\u20134, having signature wins over Arizona and South Florida, but having suffered inexplicable losses to Tulsa and Tulane. The Cougars earned a bowl bid to the 2017 [[2017 Hawaii Bowl|Hawai'i Bowl]], where they lost to the resurgent [[2017 Fresno State Bulldogs football team|Fresno State Bulldogs]], 33\u201327.

The Cougars played in the [[Lone Star Conference]] for their first few seasons through 1948. The university then decided to leave for the [[Gulf Coast Conference]]. From 1951 to 1959 Houston played in the [[Missouri Valley Conference]]. In 1956, when the NCAA split into divisions, the team began playing as a part of the University Division (later known as [[NCAA Division I|Division I]]). From 1960 to 1976 the Houston Cougars were a major independent, achieving six straight final Top-25 finishes (eight total while independent) and five bowl appearances. In 1976, the Cougars began to play in their first athletic conference since 1959 when they joined the now-defunct [[Southwest Conference]]. The Cougars became the only Texas university to ever win a pre-existing conference in their first year, doing so [[1976 Houston Cougars football team|that same year]]. After the breakup of the SWC in 1996, Houston became a charter member of then newly formed [[Conference USA]].\n\nIn October 2011, Houston was extended an invitation to join the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] in all sports.<ref name=\"UH BE1\">{{cite web|last=Khan Jr|first=Sam|title=Big East votes to formally invite schools to conference|url=http://www.chron.com/sports/cougars/article/Big-East-formally-invites-schools-no-specific-2246748.php|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=November 21, 2011}}</ref> This invitation was significant because the Big East was an [[Automatic Qualifying conference]] in football, meaning that the conference champion automatically was invited to play in a lucrative BCS bowl. The invitation was motivated by the departures of Syracuse and Pittsburgh from the Big East to the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] and was part of an effort by the Big East to shore up its strength in football. The Board of Regents of the University of Houston voted to authorize Houston President Renu Khator to take whatever action she deemed beneficial regarding conference realignment. On December 7, 2011, the University of Houston was officially announced as one of the newest members of the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]], effective July 2013.

However, with the exception of occasional single games in the 1995 and 1996 seasons, the Cougars did not return to the stadium until the 1998 season following renovations. This remained their home stadium through the 2012 season; demolition began shortly afterwards to make way for a new stadium at the same site.

In November 1316, he was appointed [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]]. He was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] in 1322 for having led the Marcher lords in a revolt against [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] in what became known as the [[Despenser War]]. He later escaped to France, where he was joined by Edward's [[queen consort]] [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], whom he may have taken as his mistress. After he and Isabella led a successful invasion and rebellion, Edward was deposed; Mortimer allegedly arranged his murder at [[Berkeley Castle]]. For three years, Mortimer was ''de facto'' ruler of England before being himself overthrown by Edward's eldest son, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Accused of assuming royal power and other crimes, Mortimer was executed by [[hanging]] at [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]].\n\n==Early life==\nMortimer, grandson of [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer]], and [[Maud de Braose, Baroness Mortimer]], was born at [[Wigmore Castle]], Herefordshire, England, the firstborn of [[Marcher Lord]] [[Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Mortimer]], and [[Margaret de Fiennes, Baroness Mortimer|Margaret de Fiennes]]. He was born on 25 April 1287, [[Feast of Saint Mark|the Feast of Saint Mark]], a day of bad omen. He shared this birthday with [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]], which would be relevant later in life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cmuedward.weebly.com/mortimer.html|title=Mortimer|website=Edward II|access-date=2017-03-20}}</ref> Edmund Mortimer was a second son, intended for minor orders and a clerical career, but on the sudden death of his elder brother Ralph, Edmund was recalled from [[Oxford University]] and installed as heir. According to his biographer Ian Mortimer, Mortimer was possibly sent as a boy away from home to be fostered in the household of his formidable uncle, [[Roger Mortimer de Chirk]].{{sfn|Mortimer|2003|p=12}} It was this uncle who had carried the severed head of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] of Wales to King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in 1282.{{sfn|Mortimer|2003|p=13}}\n\nMortimer attended the [[Coronation]] of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] on 25 February 1308 and carried a table bearing the royal robes in the ceremony's procession.{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}}\n\n==Marriage==\nLike many noble children of his time, Mortimer was betrothed at a young age, to [[Joan de Geneville]] (born 1286), the daughter of Sir Piers de Geneville, of [[Trim Castle]] and [[Ludlow]]. They were married on 20 September 1301 when he was aged fourteen. Their first child was born in 1302.{{sfn|Mortimer|2003|p=14}}\n\nThrough his marriage, Mortimer not only acquired numerous possessions in the [[Welsh Marches]], including the important [[Ludlow Castle]], which became the chief stronghold of the Mortimers, but also extensive estates and influence in Ireland.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=March, Earls of|volume=17|pages=685\u2013686|first=Ronald John|last=McNeill|authorlink=Ronald McNeill, 1st Baron Cushendun}}</ref> However, Joan de Geneville was not an \"heiress\" at the time of her marriage. Her grandfather [[Geoffrey de Geneville, 1st Baron Geneville|Geoffrey de Geneville]], at the age of eighty in 1308, conveyed most, but not all, of his Irish lordships to Mortimer, and then retired: he finally died in 1314, with Joan succeeding as ''[[suo jure]]'' 2nd Baroness Geneville. During his lifetime Geoffrey also conveyed much of the remainder of his legacy, such as Kenlys, to his younger son Simon de Geneville, who had meanwhile become Baron of Culmullin through marriage to Joanna FitzLeon. Mortimer therefore succeeded to the eastern part of the [[Lordship of Meath]], centred on [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]] and its stronghold of [[Trim Castle]]. He did not succeed, however, to the Lordship of [[Fingal]].<ref>Fingal descended firstly to Simon de Geneville (whose son Laurence predeceased him), and thence through his heiress daughter Elizabeth to her husband William de Loundres, and next through ''their'' heiress daughter, also Elizabeth, to Sir Christopher Preston, and finally to the [[Viscounts Gormanston]].</ref>\n\n== Military adventures in Ireland and Wales ==\nMortimer's childhood came to an abrupt end when his father was mortally wounded in a skirmish near [[Builth]] in July 1304. Since Mortimer was underage at the death of his father, he was placed by King Edward I under the guardianship of [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> However, on 22 May 1306, in a lavish ceremony in [[Westminster Abbey]] with two hundred and fifty-nine others, he was knighted by Edward and granted livery of his full inheritance.<ref>R. R. Davies, 'Mortimer, Roger (V), first earl of March (1287\u20131330)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19354]; accessed 14 February 2010.</ref>\n\nHis adult life began in earnest in 1308, when he went to Ireland in person to enforce his authority. This brought him into conflict with the [[de Lacy]]s, who turned for support to [[Edward Bruce]], brother of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]], King of Scots. Mortimer was appointed [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] by [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] on 23 November 1316. Shortly afterwards, at the head of a large army, he drove Bruce to [[Carrickfergus]] and the de Lacys into [[Connacht|Connaught]], wreaking vengeance on their adherents whenever they were to be found. He returned to England and Wales in 1318{{sfn|Mortimer|2003|pp=91\u201393}} and was then occupied for some years with baronial disputes on the Welsh border.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Opposition to Edward II==\n{{Main|Despenser War}}\nMortimer became disaffected with his king and joined the growing opposition to Edward II and the [[Hugh the younger Despenser|Despensers]]. After the younger Despenser was granted lands belonging to him, he and the [[Marcher Lords|Marchers]] began conducting devastating raids against Despenser property in Wales. He supported [[Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford]], in refusing to obey the king's summons to appear before him in 1321 as long as \"''the younger Despencer was in the King's train.''\"{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}} Mortimer led a march against London, his men wearing the Mortimer uniform which was green with a yellow sleeve.<ref>Costain, Thomas B. (1958). ''The Three Edwards''. Garden City, New York: Doubleday and Company, Inc. p.191</ref> He was prevented from entering the capital, although his forces put it under siege. These acts of insurrection compelled the [[Lords Ordainers]] led by [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], to order the king to banish the Despensers in August. When the king led a successful expedition in October against [[Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere]], after she had refused Queen Isabella admittance to [[Leeds Castle]], he used his victory and new popularity among the moderate lords and the people to summon the Despensers back to England. Mortimer, in company with other Marcher Lords, led a rebellion against Edward, which is known as the [[Despenser War]].{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}}\n\nIn January 1322, Mortimer attacked and burnt [[Bridgnorth]] but, being heavily outnumbered, was forced to surrender to the king at [[Shrewsbury, England|Shrewsbury]].{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}} Mortimer joined Lancaster at the [[Battle of Boroughbridge]] in March 1322 and warrants for his arrest were issued in July.{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}} A [[death sentence]] was passed upon Mortimer but this was commuted to life imprisonment and he was consigned to the [[Tower of London]].{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}} In August 1323 Mortimer, aided by Gerald de Alspaye, the sub-lieutenant or valet of the Tower's Constable,<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=OODQBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT92&dq=gerald+d%27alspaye#v=onepage&q=gerald%20d'alspaye&f=false | title=The Plantagenets: The Kings That Made Britain| isbn=9781623655914| last1=Wilson| first1=Derek| date=9 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=ouY2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA505&dq=gerald+d%27alspaye#v=onepage&q=gerald%20d'alspaye&f=false |title = Lives of the Queens of England: From the Norman Conquest|last1 = Strickland|first1 = Agnes|year = 1893}}</ref> drugged the warders during a feast,<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-Tk9oLoPTbYC&pg=PA156&dq=gerald+alspaye+segrave+mortimer+escape#v=onepage&q=gerald%20alspaye%20segrave%20mortimer%20escape&f=false |title = Queen Isabella: Treachery, Adultery, and Murder in Medieval England|isbn = 9780345497062|last1 = Weir|first1 = Alison|date = 26 December 2006}}</ref> allowing Mortimer to escape.{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}} He attempted to capture [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] and [[Wallingford Castle]]s to free imprisoned [[Contrariants]].{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}} Mortimer eventually fled to France, pursued by warrants for his capture dead or alive.<ref>E.L.G.

At the French court the queen found Mortimer, who became her lover soon afterwards. At his instigation, she refused to return to England so long as the Despensers retained power as the king's favourites.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nHistorians have speculated as to the date at which Mortimer and Isabella actually became lovers.<ref>Mortimer, 141 as cited by Alison Weir, 181; for a countervailing view see, Doherty, PC, \"Isabella, Queen of England 1296\u20131330\" (unpublished D.Phil. thesis, Exeter College, Oxford, 1977/8).</ref> The modern view is that the affair began while both were still in England, and that after a disagreement, Isabella abandoned Mortimer to his fate in the Tower. His subsequent escape became one of medieval England's most colourful episodes. However almost certainly Isabella risked everything by chancing Mortimer's companionship and emotional support when they first met again at Paris four years later (Christmas 1325). King Charles IV's protection of Isabella at the French court from Despenser's would-be assassins played a large part in developing the relationship.<ref>\"The Queen has come of her own free will, and may freely return when she so wishes. But if she prefers to remain in these parts, she is my sister, and I refuse to expel her.\" quoted in Weir, 181, from the \"Vita Edwardi Secundi\".</ref> In 1326, Mortimer moved as Prince Edward's guardian to [[Hainaut (province)|Hainault]], but only after a furious dispute with the queen, demanding she remain in France.<ref>Mortimer threatened to \"slit her throat\" if she returned to Edward and England. A threat he would live to regret when tried by the new King Edward III.</ref> Isabella retired to raise troops in her County of [[Ponthieu]]; Mortimer arranged the invasion fleet supplied by the Hainaulters and an army supplied by his supporters back in England, who had been sending him aid and advice since at least March 1326.{{sfn|Patent Rolls|1232{{ndash}}1509}}\n\n==Invasion of England and defeat of Edward II==\n{{Main|Parliament of 1327}}\n\nThe scandal of Isabella's relations with Mortimer compelled them both to withdraw from the French court to [[Flanders]], where they obtained assistance for an invasion of England from Count [[William I, Count of Hainaut|William of Hainaut]], although Isabella did not arrive from Ponthieu until the fleet was due to sail. Landing in the [[River Orwell]] on 24 September 1326, they were accompanied by Prince Edward and [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster|Henry, Earl of Lancaster]]. London rose in support of the queen, and Edward took flight to the west, pursued by Mortimer and Isabella. After wandering helplessly for some weeks in Wales, the king was taken prisoner on 16 November, and was compelled to abdicate in favour of his son. Though the latter was [[coronation|crowned]] as [[Edward III of England]] on 25 January 1327, the country was ruled by Mortimer and Isabella.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> On 21 September that same year, Edward II died in captivity. The [[Edward II of England#Controversial death|suspicious death of Edward II]] has been the subject of many conspiracy theories, including that Mortimer's men killed him, but none has been proven.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=I_s1AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT126&dq=killed+edward+ii#v=onepage&q=killed%20edward%20ii&f=false |title = Isabella and the Strange Death of Edward II: : An insightful take on an infamous murder|isbn = 9780755395804|last1 = Doherty|first1 = Paul|date = 6 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Powers won and lost==\nFollowing the removal of the Despensers, Mortimer set to work in restoring the status of his supporters, primarily in the Marches, and hundreds of pardons and restorations of property were made in the first year of the new king's reign.{{sfn|Patent Rolls|1232{{ndash}}1509}} Rich estates and offices of profit and power were heaped on Mortimer. He was made constable of [[Wallingford Castle]] and in September 1328 he was created [[Earl of March]]. However, although in military terms he was far more competent than the Despensers, his ambition was troubling to all.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His own son Geoffrey, the only one to survive into old age, mocked him as \"the king of folly\" deriding his ambitious extravagance of \"rich clothes ot of manner resoun, both of shaping and wearing.\"<ref>''The Brut, or The Chronicles of England edited from MS Rawlinson B 171'', Bod.L, 2 vols, ''EETS'' Orig. ser.131, 136, London 1906-8.</ref> During his short time as ruler of England he took over the lordships of [[Lordship of Denbigh|Denbigh]], [[Oswestry]], and [[Clun]] (the first of which belonged to Despenser, the latter two had been the Earl of Arundel's). He was also granted the [[Marcher Lord|''marcher'' lordship]] of Montgomery by the queen. During the War of Saint Sardos the Regent and his queen spent over \u00a360,000 bankrupting the Treasury, even after the proscriptions of Arundel and the Despensers. The Lancastrian opposition were incensed by this casual display of irresponsible government.<ref>Chronicon Henrici Knighton, ed.

In 1328 [[Simon de Mepham]], reportedly a Lancastrian at court, was elected Archbishop of Canterbury without controversy. However, the feuding would not stop. The day Parliament opened on 15 October Thomas of Lancaster's nemesis, Sir Robert Holland was murdered by highway robbers. Whereupon March swore on Mepham's cross that he knew nothing of it. Nonetheless the King decreed an indictment; he would be judged at law against the standards of Magna Carta. With Parliament adjourned on 31 October, he was able to slip away to his estates on the Marches. The two earls\u2019 lethal enmity, and enforced absence from the King's presence, rendered their motives almost equally suspect to rowdy Londoners. The young king would have to raise an army of archers if he was to defend his throne from a northern rebellion controlled from Lancaster. In charge of the army Lancaster blamed Mortimer and his queen for the debacle, and the highly contentious [[Treaty of Edinburgh\u2013Northampton]] with the Scots.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Calendar of Plea and Memoranda Rolls...of the City of London|last=|first=|editor-last=Thomas|editor-first=A.H.|publisher=|year=1926|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=77\u201383, 84\u20136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tyburn tree.jpg|right|thumb|The \"[[Tyburn Tree]]\"]]\n[[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster|Henry, Earl of Lancaster]], one of the principals behind Edward II's deposition, tried to overthrow Mortimer, but the action was ineffective as the young king passively stood by. Then, in March 1330, Mortimer ordered the execution of [[Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent|Edmund, Earl of Kent]], the half-brother of Edward II. After this execution Henry Lancaster prevailed upon the young king, Edward III, to assert his independence. In October 1330, a Parliament was summoned to [[Nottingham]], just days before Edward's eighteenth birthday, and Mortimer and Isabella were seized by Edward and his companions from inside [[Nottingham Castle]]. In spite of Isabella's entreaty to her son, \"Fair son, have pity on the gentle Mortimer,\" Mortimer was conveyed to the Tower. Accused of assuming royal power and of various other high misdemeanours, he was condemned without trial and [[hanged]] at Tyburn on 29 November 1330, his vast estates forfeited to the crown.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His body hung at the gallows for two days and nights in full view of the populace.

In November 1316, he was appointed [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]]. He was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] in 1322 for having led the Marcher lords in a revolt against [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] in what became known as the [[Despenser War]]. He later escaped to France, where he was joined by Edward's [[queen consort]] [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], whom he may have taken as his mistress. After he and Isabella led a successful invasion and rebellion, Edward was deposed; Mortimer allegedly arranged his murder at [[Berkeley Castle]]. For three years, Mortimer was ''de facto'' ruler of England before being himself overthrown by Edward's eldest son, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Accused of assuming royal power and other crimes, Mortimer was executed by [[hanging]] at [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]].\n\n==Early life==\nMortimer, grandson of [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer]] and [[Maud de Braose, Baroness Mortimer]], was born at [[Wigmore Castle]], Herefordshire, England, the firstborn of [[Marcher Lord]] [[Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Mortimer]], and [[Margaret de Fiennes, Baroness Mortimer|Margaret de Fiennes]]. He was born on 25 April 1287, [[Feast of Saint Mark|the Feast of Saint Mark]], a day of bad omen.

According to his biographer Ian Mortimer, Mortimer was possibly sent as a boy away from home to be fostered in the household of his formidable uncle, [[Roger Mortimer de Chirk]].{{sfn|Mortimer|2003|p=12}} It was this uncle who had carried the severed head of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] of Wales to King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in 1282.{{sfn|Mortimer|2003|p=13}}\n\nMortimer attended the [[Coronation]] of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] on 25 February 1308 and carried a table bearing the royal robes in the ceremony's procession.{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}}\n\n==Marriage==\nLike many noble children of his time, Mortimer was betrothed at a young age, to [[Joan de Geneville]] (born 1286), the daughter of Sir Piers de Geneville, of [[Trim Castle]] and [[Ludlow]]. They were married on 20 September 1301 when he was aged fourteen. Their first child was born in 1302.{{sfn|Mortimer|2003|p=14}}\n\nThrough his marriage, Mortimer not only acquired numerous possessions in the [[Welsh Marches]], including the important [[Ludlow Castle]], which became the chief stronghold of the Mortimers, but also extensive estates and influence in Ireland.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=March, Earls of|volume=17|pages=685\u2013686|first=Ronald John|last=McNeill|authorlink=Ronald McNeill, 1st Baron Cushendun}}</ref> However, Joan de Geneville was not an \"heiress\" at the time of her marriage. Her grandfather [[Geoffrey de Geneville, 1st Baron Geneville|Geoffrey de Geneville]], at the age of eighty in 1308, conveyed most, but not all, of his Irish lordships to Mortimer, and then retired: he finally died in 1314, with Joan succeeding as ''[[suo jure]]'' 2nd Baroness Geneville. During his lifetime Geoffrey also conveyed much of the remainder of his legacy, such as Kenlys, to his younger son Simon de Geneville, who had meanwhile become Baron of Culmullin through marriage to Joanna FitzLeon. Mortimer therefore succeeded to the eastern part of the [[Lordship of Meath]], centred on [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]] and its stronghold of [[Trim Castle]]. He did not succeed, however, to the Lordship of [[Fingal]].<ref>Fingal descended firstly to Simon de Geneville (whose son Laurence predeceased him), and thence through his heiress daughter Elizabeth to her husband William de Loundres, and next through ''their'' heiress daughter, also Elizabeth, to Sir Christopher Preston, and finally to the [[Viscounts Gormanston]].</ref>\n\n== Military adventures in Ireland and Wales ==\nMortimer's childhood came to an abrupt end when his father was mortally wounded in a skirmish near [[Builth]] in July 1304. Since Mortimer was underage at the death of his father, he was placed by King Edward I under the guardianship of [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> However, on 22 May 1306, in a lavish ceremony in [[Westminster Abbey]] with two hundred and fifty-nine others, he was knighted by Edward and granted livery of his full inheritance.<ref>R.

This brought him into conflict with the [[de Lacy]]s, who turned for support to [[Edward Bruce]], brother of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]], King of Scots. Mortimer was appointed [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] by [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] on 23 November 1316. Shortly afterwards, at the head of a large army, he drove Bruce to [[Carrickfergus]] and the de Lacys into [[Connacht|Connaught]], wreaking vengeance on their adherents whenever they were to be found. He returned to England and Wales in 1318{{sfn|Mortimer|2003|pp=91\u201393}} and was then occupied for some years with baronial disputes on the Welsh border.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Opposition to Edward II==\n{{Main|Despenser War}}\nMortimer became disaffected with his king and joined the growing opposition to Edward II and the [[Hugh the younger Despenser|Despensers]]. After the younger Despenser was granted lands belonging to him, he and the [[Marcher Lords|Marchers]] began conducting devastating raids against Despenser property in Wales. He supported [[Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford]], in refusing to obey the king's summons to appear before him in 1321 as long as \"''the younger Despencer was in the King's train.''\"{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}} Mortimer led a march against London, his men wearing the Mortimer uniform which was green with a yellow sleeve.<ref>Costain, Thomas B.

These acts of insurrection compelled the [[Lords Ordainers]] led by [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], to order the king to banish the Despensers in August. When the king led a successful expedition in October against [[Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere]], after she had refused Queen Isabella admittance to [[Leeds Castle]], he used his victory and new popularity among the moderate lords and the people to summon the Despensers back to England. Mortimer, in company with other Marcher Lords, led a rebellion against Edward, which is known as the [[Despenser War]].{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}}\n\nIn January 1322, Mortimer attacked and burnt [[Bridgnorth]] but, being heavily outnumbered, was forced to surrender to the king at [[Shrewsbury, England|Shrewsbury]].{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}} Mortimer joined Lancaster at the [[Battle of Boroughbridge]] in March 1322 and warrants for his arrest were issued in July.{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}} A [[death sentence]] was passed upon Mortimer but this was commuted to life imprisonment and he was consigned to the [[Tower of London]].{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}} In August 1323 Mortimer, aided by Gerald de Alspaye, the sub-lieutenant or valet of the Tower's Constable,<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=OODQBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT92&dq=gerald+d%27alspaye#v=onepage&q=gerald%20d'alspaye&f=false | title=The Plantagenets: The Kings That Made Britain| isbn=9781623655914| last1=Wilson| first1=Derek| date=9 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=ouY2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA505&dq=gerald+d%27alspaye#v=onepage&q=gerald%20d'alspaye&f=false |title = Lives of the Queens of England: From the Norman Conquest|last1 = Strickland|first1 = Agnes|year = 1893}}</ref> drugged the warders during a feast,<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-Tk9oLoPTbYC&pg=PA156&dq=gerald+alspaye+segrave+mortimer+escape#v=onepage&q=gerald%20alspaye%20segrave%20mortimer%20escape&f=false |title = Queen Isabella: Treachery, Adultery, and Murder in Medieval England|isbn = 9780345497062|last1 = Weir|first1 = Alison|date = 26 December 2006}}</ref> allowing Mortimer to escape.{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}} He attempted to capture [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] and [[Wallingford Castle]]s to free imprisoned [[Contrariants]].{{sfn|Parl Writs II Digest|1834}} Mortimer eventually fled to France, pursued by warrants for his capture dead or alive.<ref>E.L.G.

At his instigation, she refused to return to England so long as the Despensers retained power as the king's favourites.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nHistorians have speculated as to the date at which Mortimer and Isabella actually became lovers.<ref>Mortimer, 141 as cited by Alison Weir, 181; for a countervailing view see, Doherty, PC, \"Isabella, Queen of England 1296\u20131330\" (unpublished D.Phil. thesis, Exeter College, Oxford, 1977/8).</ref> The modern view is that the affair began while both were still in England, and that after a disagreement, Isabella abandoned Mortimer to his fate in the Tower. His subsequent escape became one of medieval England's most colourful episodes. However almost certainly Isabella risked everything by chancing Mortimer's companionship and emotional support when they first met again at Paris four years later (Christmas 1325). King Charles IV's protection of Isabella at the French court from Despenser's would-be assassins played a large part in developing the relationship.<ref>\"The Queen has come of her own free will, and may freely return when she so wishes. But if she prefers to remain in these parts, she is my sister, and I refuse to expel her.\" quoted in Weir, 181, from the \"Vita Edwardi Secundi\".</ref> In 1326, Mortimer moved as Prince Edward's guardian to [[Hainaut (province)|Hainault]], but only after a furious dispute with the queen, demanding she remain in France.<ref>Mortimer threatened to \"slit her throat\" if she returned to Edward and England. A threat he would live to regret when tried by the new King Edward III.</ref> Isabella retired to raise troops in her County of [[Ponthieu]]; Mortimer arranged the invasion fleet supplied by the Hainaulters and an army supplied by his supporters back in England, who had been sending him aid and advice since at least March 1326.{{sfn|Patent Rolls|1232{{ndash}}1509}}\n\n==Invasion of England and defeat of Edward II==\n{{Main|Parliament of 1327}}\n\nThe scandal of Isabella's relations with Mortimer compelled them both to withdraw from the French court to [[Flanders]], where they obtained assistance for an invasion of England from Count [[William I, Count of Hainaut|William of Hainaut]], although Isabella did not arrive from Ponthieu until the fleet was due to sail. Landing in the [[River Orwell]] on 24 September 1326, they were accompanied by Prince Edward and [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster|Henry, Earl of Lancaster]]. London rose in support of the queen, and Edward took flight to the west, pursued by Mortimer and Isabella. After wandering helplessly for some weeks in Wales, the king was taken prisoner on 16 November, and was compelled to abdicate in favour of his son. Though the latter was [[coronation|crowned]] as [[Edward III of England]] on 25 January 1327, the country was ruled by Mortimer and Isabella.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> On 21 September that same year, Edward II died in captivity.

However, although in military terms he was far more competent than the Despensers, his ambition was troubling to all.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His own son Geoffrey, the only one to survive into old age, mocked him as \"the king of folly\" deriding his ambitious extravagance of \"rich clothes ot of manner resoun, both of shaping and wearing.\"<ref>''The Brut, or The Chronicles of England edited from MS Rawlinson B 171'', Bod.L, 2 vols, ''EETS'' Orig. ser.131, 136, London 1906-8.</ref> During his short time as ruler of England he took over the lordships of [[Lordship of Denbigh|Denbigh]], [[Oswestry]], and [[Clun]] (the first of which belonged to Despenser, the latter two had been the Earl of Arundel's). He was also granted the [[Marcher Lord|''marcher'' lordship]] of Montgomery by the queen. During the War of Saint Sardos the Regent and his queen spent over \u00a360,000 bankrupting the Treasury, even after the proscriptions of Arundel and the Despensers. The Lancastrian opposition were incensed by this casual display of irresponsible government.<ref>Chronicon Henrici Knighton, ed. J.R.Lumby, vol.1, RS 92, 1889;new ed. 1337-96, H.G.Martin (Oxford, 1995), I, 447.</ref>\n\nThe jealousy and anger of many nobles were aroused by Mortimer's use of power, which in many ways was tenuous. In 1328 [[Simon de Mepham]], reportedly a Lancastrian at court, was elected Archbishop of Canterbury without controversy. However, the feuding would not stop. The day Parliament opened on 15 October Thomas of Lancaster's nemesis, Sir Robert Holland was murdered by highway robbers. Whereupon March swore on Mepham's cross that he knew nothing of it. Nonetheless the King decreed an indictment; he would be judged at law against the standards of Magna Carta. With Parliament adjourned on 31 October, he was able to slip away to his estates on the Marches. The two earls\u2019 lethal enmity, and enforced absence from the King's presence, rendered their motives almost equally suspect to rowdy Londoners. The young king would have to raise an army of archers if he was to defend his throne from a northern rebellion controlled from Lancaster. In charge of the army Lancaster blamed Mortimer and his queen for the debacle, and the highly contentious [[Treaty of Edinburgh\u2013Northampton]] with the Scots.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Calendar of Plea and Memoranda Rolls...of the City of London|last=|first=|editor-last=Thomas|editor-first=A.H.|publisher=|year=1926|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=77\u201383, 84\u20136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tyburn tree.jpg|right|thumb|The \"[[Tyburn Tree]]\"]]\n[[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster|Henry, Earl of Lancaster]], one of the principals behind Edward II's deposition, tried to overthrow Mortimer, but the action was ineffective as the young king passively stood by. Then, in March 1330, Mortimer ordered the execution of [[Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent|Edmund, Earl of Kent]], the half-brother of Edward II. After this execution Henry Lancaster prevailed upon the young king, Edward III, to assert his independence. In October 1330, a Parliament was summoned to [[Nottingham]], just days before Edward's eighteenth birthday, and Mortimer and Isabella were seized by Edward and his companions from inside [[Nottingham Castle]]. In spite of Isabella's entreaty to her son, \"Fair son, have pity on the gentle Mortimer,\" Mortimer was conveyed to the Tower. Accused of assuming royal power and of various other high misdemeanours, he was condemned without trial and [[hanged]] at Tyburn on 29 November 1330, his vast estates forfeited to the crown.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His body hung at the gallows for two days and nights in full view of the populace. Mortimer's widow Joan received a pardon in 1336 and survived until 1356. She was buried beside Mortimer at Wigmore, but the site was later destroyed.<ref>Costain, p.275</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the actor [[John Challis]], the owner of the remaining buildings of Wigmore Abbey, invited the BBC programme ''House Detectives at Large'' to investigate his property. During the investigation, a document was discovered in which Mortimer's widow Joan petitioned Edward III for the return of her husband's body so she could bury it at [[Wigmore Abbey]]. Mortimer's lover Isabella had buried his body at [[Greyfriars, Coventry|Greyfriars in Coventry]] following his hanging. Edward III replied, \"Let his body rest in peace.\" The king later relented, and Mortimer's body was transferred to [[Wigmore Abbey]], where Joan was later buried beside him.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Children==\nThe marriages of Mortimer's children (three sons and eight daughters) cemented Mortimer's strengths in the West.\n* [[Edmund Mortimer, son of the 1st Earl|Sir Edmund Mortimer]] knt (1302\u20131331), married [[Elizabeth de Badlesmere]]; they produced [[Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March]], who was restored to his grandfather's title.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n* [[Margaret Mortimer, Baroness Berkeley|Margaret Mortimer]] (1304{{snd}}5 May 1337), married [[Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley]]\n* Maud Mortimer (1307{{snd}}after 1345), married [[John Charleton, 2nd Baron Cherleton|John de Charlton, Lord of Powys]]<ref>Charles Hopkinson and Martin Speight, ''The Mortimers: Lords of the March'' (Logaston Press 2002), pp. 84\u20135.</ref>\n* Geoffrey Mortimer (1309\u20131372/6), who inherited the French seigneurie of [[Couh\u00e9]] as the assigned heir of his grandmother [[Joan of Lusignan]], and founded a branch of the family based in France.<ref>Watson 1906, pp. 1-3.</ref>\n* John Mortimer (1310\u20131328)\n* Joan Mortimer (c. 1312{{snd}}1337/51), married [[James Audley, 2nd Baron Audley]]\n* Isabella Mortimer (c. 1313{{snd}}after 1327)\n* [[Katherine Mortimer]] (c. 1314{{snd}}1369), married [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick]]\n* [[Agnes Mortimer, Countess of Pembroke|Agnes Mortimer]] (c. 1317{{snd}}1368), married [[Laurence Hastings, 1st Earl of Pembroke]]\n* Beatrice Mortimer (died 16 October 1383), who married firstly, [[Edward of Norfolk]] (died before 9 August 1334), son and heir apparent of [[Thomas of Brotherton]], by whom she had no issue, and secondly, before 13 September 1337, Thomas de Brewes (died 9 or 16 June 1361), by whom she had three sons and three daughters.{{sfn|Richardson II|2011|p=634}}\n* Blanche Mortimer (c. 1321{{snd}}1347), married [[Baron Grandison|Peter de Grandison, 2nd Baron Grandison]]\n\n==Descendants==\nThrough his son [[Edmund Mortimer, son of the 1st Earl|Sir Edmund Mortimer]], he is an ancestor of the last [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] monarchs of England from King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] to [[Richard III of England|Richard III]].

He has been described as \"rock & roll's first great wild man and one of the most influential pianists of the twentieth century.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Bogdanov|first=Vladimir|title=All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music|url=https://archive.org/details/allmusicguidedef00bogd|url-access=registration|year=2001|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco |page=[https://archive.org/details/allmusicguidedef00bogd/page/234 234]}}</ref>\n\nA pioneer of [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]] music, Lewis made his first recordings in 1956 at [[Sun Records]] in Memphis. \"[[Crazy Arms]]\" sold 300,000 copies in the South, but it was his 1957 hit \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]\" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. He followed this with \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", \"[[Breathless (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|Breathless]]\" and \"[[High School Confidential (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|High School Confidential]]\". However, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to [[Myra Gale Brown]], his 13-year-old cousin because of his tendency to be a predator.\n\nHe had minimal success in the charts following the scandal, and his popularity quickly eroded. In the early 1960s, he did not have much chart success, with few exceptions, such as a cover of [[Ray Charles]]'s \"[[What'd I Say]]\". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'' is regarded by music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever.<ref name = \"Checksfield\">Checksfield, Peter (1995). \"Jerry Lee Lewis.

In the 21st century, Lewis continues to tour around the world and still releases new albums. His 2006 album ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'' is his best selling to date, with over a million copies sold worldwide. This was followed by ''[[Mean Old Man]]'' in 2010, which has received some of the best sales of Lewis's career.\n\nLewis has a dozen gold records in both rock and country.

His parents [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]] their farm to buy him a piano.

But Lewis daringly played a boogie-woogie rendition of \"My God Is Real\" at a church assembly, which ended his association with the school the same night. Pearry Green, then president of the student body, related how during a talent show Lewis played some \"worldly\" music. The next morning, the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the school called Lewis and Green into his office to expel them.

Around 1955, he traveled to [[Nashville]], where he played in clubs and attempted to build interest, but he was turned down by the [[Grand Ole Opry]], as he had already been at the [[Louisiana Hayride]] country stage and radio show in Shreveport.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\nRecording executives in Nashville suggested he switch to playing the guitar.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Sun Records===\n[[File:GreenbackDollar.ogg|right|thumb|[[Sun Records]] artist [[Ray Harris]] singing the song \"Greenback Dollar\", with Lewis playing the piano]]\nIn November 1956, Lewis traveled to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to audition for [[Sun Records]].

In December 1956, Lewis began recording prolifically, as a solo artist and as a [[session musician]] for other Sun artists, including [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. His distinctive piano playing can be heard on many tracks recorded at Sun in late 1956 and early 1957, including Carl Perkins's \"[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]\", \"[[Your True Love]]\", \" and \"Put Your Cat Clothes On\" and [[Billy Lee Riley]]'s \"Flyin' Saucers Rock'n'Roll\". Formerly, [[rockabilly]] had rarely featured piano, but it proved an influential addition, and rockabilly artists on other labels also started working with pianists.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nOn December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with Lewis backing him on piano. Johnny Cash was also there watching Perkins. The four then started an impromptu [[jam session]], and Phillips left the tape running.<ref name=pc8/> These recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, have been released on CD as ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. Tracks also include Elvis Presley's \"[[Don't Be Cruel]]\" and \"[[Paralyzed (Elvis Presley song)|Paralyzed]]\", [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Brown Eyed Handsome Man]]\", [[Pat Boone]]'s \"Don't Forbid Me\" and Presley doing an impersonation of [[Jackie Wilson]] (who was then with [[Billy Ward and the Dominoes]]) on \"Don't Be Cruel\".\n\nLewis's own singles (on which he was billed as \"Jerry Lee Lewis and his Pumping Piano\") advanced his career as a soloist during 1957, with hits such as \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]\", a [[Big Maybelle]] cover, and \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", his biggest hit, bringing him international fame, despite criticism for the songs, which prompted some radio stations to boycott them. In 2005, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" was selected for permanent preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] of the Library of Congress.\nAccording to several first-hand sources, including [[Johnny Cash]], Lewis, a devout Christian, was troubled by the sinful nature of his own material, which he believed was leading him and his audience to hell.<ref>Cash, Johnny (1997). ''[[Cash: The Autobiography]]''. p. 98.</ref> This aspect of Lewis's character was depicted in [[Waylon Payne]]'s portrayal of Lewis in the 2005 film ''[[Walk the Line]]'', based on Cash's autobiographies.\n\nAs part of his stage act, Lewis pounded the keys with his heel, kicked the piano bench aside and played standing, raking his hands up and down the keyboard for dramatic effect, sat on the keyboard and even stood on top of the instrument.

King]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Carl Perkins]], Lewis, [[Johnny Cash]] and others, and also opened a studio in Nashville. It was at the latter studio that Lewis recorded his only major hit during this period, a rendition of [[Ray Charles]]'s \"[[What'd I Say]]\" in 1961. In Europe, other updated versions of \"[[Sweet Little Sixteen]]\" (September 1962 UK) and \"[[Good Golly Miss Molly]]\" (March 1963) entered the [[hit parade]]. On popular EPs, \"Hang Up My Rock and Roll Shoes\", \"I've Been Twistin'\", \"Money\" and \"Hello Josephine\" also became turntable hits, especially in nascent [[discoth\u00e8que]]s. Another recording of Lewis playing an instrumental boogie arrangement of the [[Glenn Miller Orchestra]] favorite \"[[In the Mood]]\" was issued on the [[Phillips International Records|Phillips International]] label under the pseudonym \"The Hawk\".{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n===Smash Records===\nLewis's Sun recording contract ended in 1963, and he joined [[Smash Records]], where he made a number of rock recordings that did not further his career. The team at Smash (a division of [[Mercury Records]]) came up with \"I'm on Fire\", a song that they felt would be perfect for Lewis and, as Colin Escott writes in the sleeve to the retrospective ''A Half Century of Hits'', \"Mercury held the presses, thinking they had found Lewis's comeback hit, and it might have happened if the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] hadn't arrived in [[United States|America]], changing radio playlists almost overnight. Mercury didn't really know what to do with Lewis after that.\" One of Smash's first decisions was to record a retread of his Sun hits, ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'' which was inspired by the continuing enthusiasm UK and European fans had shown for Lewis's firebrand rock and roll. In June 1963, Lewis returned to the UK for the first time since the scandal that nearly ended his career five years earlier, to headline a performance on the ''[[MV Royal Daffodil (1939)|MV Royal Daffodil]]'', for a [[English Channel|cross-channel]] rock and roll cruise from [[Southend-on-Sea|Southend, Essex, UK]] to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne, France]]. For this performance, he was backed by [[Ritchie Blackmore]] and [[The Outlaws (band)|The Outlaws]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1f53kihTyRMC&pg=PA100-IA5&lpg=PA100-IA5&dq=June+1,+1963+MV+Royal+Daffodil&source=bl&ots=1plPKgdfGi&sig=ACfU3U3_bMWR5SZWQPo65mvpuHZFyRMK9g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjR8pqe_ZDoAhXZHzQIHcKwCtIQ6AEwAHoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&q=June%201%2C%201963%20MV%20Royal%20Daffodil&f=false ''Black Knight: Ritchie Blackmore'' by Jerry Bloom]</ref> However, despite his successful live tours, none of Lewis's early Smash albums, including ''[[The Return of Rock]]'', ''Memphis Beat'', and ''[[Soul My Way]]'', were commercial successes. \n\n===''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg''===\nOne major success during these lost years was the concert album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'', recorded with the [[The Nashville Teens|Nashville Teens]] in 1964, which is considered one of the greatest live rock-and-roll albums ever.<ref name=\"Checksfield\"/><ref name=\"Q-2002\"/><ref name=\"Mojo-2004\"/><ref name=\"AMG-Erlewine\"/><ref name=\"Rolling-Stone-2009\">\n{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jerryleelewis/albums/album/284513/review/5940644/live_at_the_star_club_hamburg_bear_family |title=Jerry Lee Lewis: Live at the Star Club, Hamburg [Bear Family] |accessdate=February 18, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910033507/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jerryleelewis/albums/album/284513/review/5940644/live_at_the_star_club_hamburg_bear_family |archivedate=September 10, 2009}}</ref> In [[Joe Bonomo]]'s book ''Lost and Found'', producer Siggi Loch stated that the recording setup was uncomplicated, with microphones placed as close to the instruments as possible and a stereo mic placed in the audience to capture the ambience. The results were sonically astonishing, with Bonomo observing, \"Detractors complain of the album's crashing noisiness, the lack of subtlety with which Jerry Lee revisits the songs, the fact that the piano is mixed too loudly, but what is certain is that Siggi Loch on this spring evening captured something brutally honest about the Killer, about the primal and timeless center of the very best rock & roll...\" The album showcases Lewis's skills as a pianist and singer, honed by relentless touring. In a 5-out-of-5-stars review, Milo Miles wrote in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine that \"''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg'' is not an album, it's a crime scene: Jerry Lee Lewis slaughters his rivals in a thirteen-song set that feels like one long convulsion.\" Due to legal constraints, the album was not released in the United States at the time.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n===Country comeback===\n[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis performing with [[Carl Perkins]], [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Johnny Cash]] on ''The Johnny Cash Christmas Special'' in November 1977]]\nFrustrated by Smash's inability to score a hit, Lewis was nearing the end of his contract when promotions manager [[Eddie Kilroy]] called him and pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the Jerry Chestnut song \"[[Another Place, Another Time]]\", which was released as a single on March 9, 1968, and, to everyone's amazement, shot up the country charts. At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing [[Iago]] in a rock and roll adaptation of ''Othello'' called ''Catch My Soul'' in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer [[Jerry Kennedy]]. What followed was a string of hits that no one could have ever predicted, although country music had always remained a major part of Lewis's repertoire. As Colin Escott observes in the sleeve to the 1995 compilation ''Killer Country'', the conversion to country music in 1968 \"looked at the time like a radical shift, but it was neither as abrupt nor as unexpected as it seemed. Jerry had always recorded country music, and his country breakthrough 'Another Place, Another Time' had been preceded by many, many country records starting with his first, '[[Crazy Arms]]', in 1956.\" The last time Lewis had a song on the country charts was with \"Pen and Paper\" in 1964, which had reached number 36, but \"Another Place, Another Time\" would go all the way to number 4 and remain on the charts for 17 weeks.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, including four chart toppers. Hits include \"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)\", \"To Make Love Sweeter For You\", \"She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)\", \"Since I Met You Baby\", \"Once More With Feeling\", \"One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)\", and \"Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough\". The production on his early country albums, such as ''[[Another Place, Another Time]]'' and ''She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye'', was sparse, quite different from the slick \"[[Nashville sound]]\" that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. The songs still featured Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as [[George Jones]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. In his book ''Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story'', biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording \"were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio\".\n\nIn a remarkable turnaround, Lewis became the most bankable country star in the world. He was so huge in 1970 that his former Smash producer [[Shelby Singleton]], who purchased [[Sun Records]] from [[Sam Phillips]] in July 1969, wasted no time in repackaging many of Lewis's old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases. One of his latter unreleased Sun recordings, \"[[One Minute Past Eternity]],\" was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart, following Lewis's recent [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] hit \"She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye.\" Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following ''The Golden Cream of the Country'' with ''[[A Taste of Country]]'' later in 1970.\n\n===Grand Ole Opry appearance===\nLewis played the [[Grand Ole Opry]] for the first and only time on January 20, 1973. As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to ''A Half Century of Hits'', Lewis had always maintained ambivalent feelings towards [[Nashville, Tennessee|Music City]] ever since he'd been turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at [[Sun Records]]: \"It was 18 years since he had left [[Nashville]] broke and disheartened... Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. He didn't move there and didn't schmooze there. He didn't fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren't necessarily worse, but they were different.\"\n\nAs recounted in a 2015 online ''Rolling Stone'' article by Beville Dunkerly, Lewis opened with his comeback single \"Another Place, Another Time\". Ignoring his allotted time constraints&mdash;and, thus, commercial breaks&mdash;Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight minutes of stage time maximum) and invited [[Del Wood]]&mdash;the one member of the Opry who had been kind to him when he had been there as a teenager&mdash;out on stage to sing with him. He also blasted through \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On\", \"Workin' Man Blues\", \"[[Good Golly Miss Molly]]\", and a host of other classics before leaving the stage to a thunderous standing ovation.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===''The Session'' and ''Southern Roots''===\nLewis returned to the pop charts with \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\" in 1971 and \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" in 1972, and this turn of events, coupled with a revitalized public interest in vintage [[rock and roll]], inspired Mercury to fly Lewis to London in 1973 to record with a cadre of gifted British and Irish musicians, including [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Kenney Jones]], and Albert Lee. By all accounts the sessions were tense. The remake of Lewis's old Sun cut \"Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" would be the album's hit single, reaching number 20 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and peaking at number 41 on the pop chart. ''The Session'' would be Lewis's highest pop charting album since 1964's ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'', hitting number 37. It did far better on the country albums chart, rising to number 4. Later that same year, he went to Memphis and recorded ''[[Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis]]'', a soul-infused rock album produced by Huey Meaux.\n\nAccording to Rick Bragg's authorized 2014 biography, \"the Killer\" was in a foul mood when he showed up at Trans Maximus Studios in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to record: \"During these sessions, he insulted the producer, threatened to kill a photographer, and drank and medicated his way into but not out of a fog.\" During one exchange that can be heard on the 2013 reissue ''Southern Roots: The Original Sessions'', Meaux asks Lewis, \"Do you wanna try one?\", meaning a take, to which Lewis replies, \"If you got enough fuckin' sense to cut it.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Lewis was still pumping out country albums, although the hits were beginning to dry up. His last big hit with Mercury was \"Middle Age Crazy,\" which made it to number 4 in 1977.\n[[File:JerryLee Lewis 1973.jpg|thumb|right|Lewis performing in 1977]]\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Jerry Lee Lewis @ Credicard Hall 01 (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|Lewis performing in 2009]]\nIn 1979, Lewis switched to [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] and produced the critically acclaimed ''Jerry Lee Lewis'', although sales were disappointing. In 1986, Lewis was one of the inaugural inductees into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Although looking frail after several hospitalizations due to stomach problems, Lewis was responsible for beginning an unplanned jam at the end of the evening, which was immediately incorporated into the event. That year, he returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to team up with Orbison, Cash, and Perkins along with longtime admirers like [[John Fogerty]] to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]'', a sort of followup to the [[Million Dollar Quartet]] session, though in the eyes of many critics and fans, lacking the spirit of the old days at Sun.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 1989, a major motion picture based on his early life in rock and roll, ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'', brought him back into the public eye, especially when he decided to re-record all his songs for the movie soundtrack. The film was based on the book by Lewis's ex-wife, Myra Gale Lewis, and starred [[Dennis Quaid]] as Lewis, [[Winona Ryder]] as Myra, and [[Alec Baldwin]] as Jimmy Swaggart. The movie focuses on Lewis's early career and his relationship with Myra, and ends with the scandal of the late 1950s. A year later, in 1990, Lewis made minor news when a new song he recorded called \"It Was the Whiskey Talkin' (Not Me)\" was included in the soundtrack to the hit movie ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. The song is also heard in the movie, playing on a radio. The public downfall of his cousin, television evangelist [[Jimmy Swaggart]], resulted in more adverse publicity to a troubled family. Swaggart is also a piano player, as is another cousin, country music star [[Mickey Gilley]]. All three listened to the same music in their youth, and frequented Haney's Big House, the Ferriday club that featured black blues acts. Lewis and Swaggart have had a complex relationship over the years.\n\n[[File:JerryLeeLewis.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis performing at the Rhythm Festival in [[Bedford, England]] in 2006]]\nIn 1998, Lewis toured Europe with [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} On February 12, 2005, he was given a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] by [[The Recording Academy]].<ref name=\":2\" /> On September 26, 2006, a new album titled ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'' was released, featuring many of rock and roll's elite as guest stars.

My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that.\" Lewis is primarily known for his \"boogie woogie\" style, which is characterized by a regular left hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. Appearing on ''Memphis Sounds with [[George Klein (disc jockey)|George Klein]]'' in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, \"He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice looking man, carried himself real well. I miss Carl very much.\" Lewis also cited [[Moon Mullican]] as a source of inspiration.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nAlthough Lewis's piano playing is commonly labeled boogie woogie, gospel music was another major influence in the formation of his technique. In Joe Bonomo's 2009 book ''Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found'', Memphis producer and musician [[Jim Dickinson]] calls Lewis's occasional penchant for interrupting the standard boogie woogie left-hand progression by omitting the seventh and repeating the fifth and sixth, creating a repetitive, driving, quasi-menacing momentum, \"revolutionary, almost inexplicable. Maybe [[Ella Mae Morse]], maybe Moon Mullican had done it, but not in a way that became the propelling force of the song. Rock and roll piano up to that point had been defined by Rosco Gordon, [[Ike Turner]], and to an extent, Ray Charles. None of them were doing that.

Lewis had a recorded argument with [[Sam Phillips]] during the recording session for \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", a song he initially refused to record because he considered it blasphemous (\"How can\u2026  How can the devil save souls?  What are you ''talkin' about''?\" he asks Phillips during one heated exchange.) During the famous [[Million Dollar Quartet]] jam involving Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, they performed several gospel songs. Lewis's biographer [[Rick Bragg]] explains that part of the reason the recording only features Lewis and Elvis singing is because \"only Elvis and Jerry Lee [were] raised in the [[Assemblies of God |Assembly of God]]\", and {{\"'}}Johnny and Carl didn't really know the words\u2026  they was [[Baptists]]', [Lewis] said, and therefore deprived.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bragg|first=Rick |authorlink=Rick Bragg|title=Jerry Lee and Me|journal= [[Garden & Gun]]|date=October\u2013November 2014|url= http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |accessdate=October 7, 2015 |url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151121073447/http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |archivedate= November 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990 documentary ''The Jerry Lee Lewis Story'', Lewis said to the interviewer, \"The Bible don't even speak of religion.

I find myself falling short of the glory of God.\"\n\nGospel music was a staple of his performing repertoire.

Later that night, Lewis was at a [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] nightclub called Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new [[Lincoln Continental]] with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before three o'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates.\n\nPresley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle out the car window, not realizing the window was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but \"Elvis, watching on the [[closed-circuit television]], told guards to call the police. The Memphis police found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening them, away in handcuffs.\" Lewis said, \"The cops asked Elvis, 'What do you want us to do? And Elvis told 'em, 'Lock him up.' That hurt my feelings. To be scared of me \u2013 knowin' me the way he did \u2013 was ridiculous.\" Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mugshot was wired around the world.

He has been described as \"rock & roll's first great wild man and one of the most influential pianists of the twentieth century.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Bogdanov|first=Vladimir|title=All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music|url=https://archive.org/details/allmusicguidedef00bogd|url-access=registration|year=2001|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco |page=[https://archive.org/details/allmusicguidedef00bogd/page/234 234]}}</ref>\n\nA pioneer of [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]] music, Lewis made his first recordings in 1956 at [[Sun Records]] in Memphis. \"[[Crazy Arms]]\" sold 300,000 copies in the South, but it was his 1957 hit \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]\" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. He followed this with \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", \"[[Breathless (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|Breathless]]\" and \"[[High School Confidential (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|High School Confidential]]\". However, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to [[Myra Gale Brown]], his 13-year-old cousin.\n\nHe had minimal success in the charts following the scandal, and his popularity quickly eroded. In the early 1960s, he did not have much chart success, with few exceptions, such as a cover of [[Ray Charles]]'s \"[[What'd I Say]]\". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'' is regarded by music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever.<ref name = \"Checksfield\">Checksfield, Peter (1995). \"Jerry Lee Lewis.

This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis has had 30 songs reach the top 10 on the \"[[Billboard Hot Country Songs|Billboard Country and Western Chart]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005|title=Jerry Lee Lewis, the Enduring Rebel of Rock 'n' Roll|first=Marc|last=Myers|date=October 24, 2014|via=www.wsj.com}}</ref> His No. 1 country hits included \"[[To Make Love Sweeter for You]]\", \"[[There Must Be More to Love Than This]]\", \"[[Would You Take Another Chance on Me]]\", and \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\".\n\nLewis's successes continued throughout the decade and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of the [[Big Bopper]]'s \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" and [[Mack Vickery]]'s \"Rockin' My Life Away\". In the 21st century, Lewis continues to tour around the world and still releases new albums. His 2006 album ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'' is his best selling to date, with over a million copies sold worldwide. This was followed by ''[[Mean Old Man]]'' in 2010, which has received some of the best sales of Lewis's career.\n\nLewis has a dozen gold records in both rock and country. He received four Grammy awards, including a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and two [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] Awards.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/jerry-lee-lewis|title=Jerry Lee Lewis|last=|first=|date=|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Lewis was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].

His parents [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]] their farm to buy him a piano. Lewis was influenced by a piano-playing older cousin, [[Carl McVoy]] (who later recorded with [[Bill Black]]'s Combo), the radio, and the sounds from Haney's Big House, a black [[juke joint]] across the tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040716210854/http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 16, 2004 |title=Natchez Under The Hill Saloon \u2013 Natchez Mississippi |publisher=Underthehillsaloon.com |date=April 16, 2004 |accessdate=July 11, 2015 }}</ref> On November 19, 1949, Lewis made his first public performance of his career, playing with a [[country and western]] band at a car dealership in Ferriday.

But Lewis daringly played a boogie-woogie rendition of \"My God Is Real\" at a church assembly, which ended his association with the school the same night. Pearry Green, then president of the student body, related how during a talent show Lewis played some \"worldly\" music. The next morning, the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the school called Lewis and Green into his office to expel them. Lewis said that Green should not be expelled because \"he didn't know what I was going to do.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nAfter that incident, he went home and started playing at clubs in and around Ferriday and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], becoming part of the burgeoning new [[rock and roll]] sound and cutting his first demo recording in 1954. Around 1955, he traveled to [[Nashville]], where he played in clubs and attempted to build interest, but he was turned down by the [[Grand Ole Opry]], as he had already been at the [[Louisiana Hayride]] country stage and radio show in Shreveport.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\nRecording executives in Nashville suggested he switch to playing the guitar.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Sun Records===\n[[File:GreenbackDollar.ogg|right|thumb|[[Sun Records]] artist [[Ray Harris]] singing the song \"Greenback Dollar\", with Lewis playing the piano]]\nIn November 1956, Lewis traveled to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to audition for [[Sun Records]]. Label owner [[Sam Phillips]] was in Florida, but producer and engineer [[Jack Clement]] recorded Lewis's rendition of [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]]'s \"[[Crazy Arms]]\" and his own composition \"[[End of the Road (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|End of the Road]]\". In December 1956, Lewis began recording prolifically, as a solo artist and as a [[session musician]] for other Sun artists, including [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. His distinctive piano playing can be heard on many tracks recorded at Sun in late 1956 and early 1957, including Carl Perkins's \"[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]\", \"[[Your True Love]]\", \" and \"Put Your Cat Clothes On\" and [[Billy Lee Riley]]'s \"Flyin' Saucers Rock'n'Roll\". Formerly, [[rockabilly]] had rarely featured piano, but it proved an influential addition, and rockabilly artists on other labels also started working with pianists.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nOn December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with Lewis backing him on piano. Johnny Cash was also there watching Perkins. The four then started an impromptu [[jam session]], and Phillips left the tape running.<ref name=pc8/> These recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, have been released on CD as ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. Tracks also include Elvis Presley's \"[[Don't Be Cruel]]\" and \"[[Paralyzed (Elvis Presley song)|Paralyzed]]\", [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Brown Eyed Handsome Man]]\", [[Pat Boone]]'s \"Don't Forbid Me\" and Presley doing an impersonation of [[Jackie Wilson]] (who was then with [[Billy Ward and the Dominoes]]) on \"Don't Be Cruel\".\n\nLewis's own singles (on which he was billed as \"Jerry Lee Lewis and his Pumping Piano\") advanced his career as a soloist during 1957, with hits such as \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]\", a [[Big Maybelle]] cover, and \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", his biggest hit, bringing him international fame, despite criticism for the songs, which prompted some radio stations to boycott them. In 2005, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" was selected for permanent preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] of the Library of Congress.\nAccording to several first-hand sources, including [[Johnny Cash]], Lewis, a devout Christian, was troubled by the sinful nature of his own material, which he believed was leading him and his audience to hell.<ref>Cash, Johnny (1997). ''[[Cash: The Autobiography]]''. p. 98.</ref> This aspect of Lewis's character was depicted in [[Waylon Payne]]'s portrayal of Lewis in the 2005 film ''[[Walk the Line]]'', based on Cash's autobiographies.\n\nAs part of his stage act, Lewis pounded the keys with his heel, kicked the piano bench aside and played standing, raking his hands up and down the keyboard for dramatic effect, sat on the keyboard and even stood on top of the instrument. Lewis told ''the [[Pop Chronicles]]'' that kicking over the bench originally happened by accident, but when it got a favorable response, he kept it in the act.<ref name=pc8>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19756/m1/ |title=Show 8 \u2013 The All American Boy: Enter Elvis and the Rock-a-Billies.

King]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Carl Perkins]], Lewis, [[Johnny Cash]] and others, and also opened a studio in Nashville. It was at the latter studio that Lewis recorded his only major hit during this period, a rendition of [[Ray Charles]]'s \"[[What'd I Say]]\" in 1961. In Europe, other updated versions of \"[[Sweet Little Sixteen]]\" (September 1962 UK) and \"[[Good Golly Miss Molly]]\" (March 1963) entered the [[hit parade]]. On popular EPs, \"Hang Up My Rock and Roll Shoes\", \"I've Been Twistin'\", \"Money\" and \"Hello Josephine\" also became turntable hits, especially in nascent [[discoth\u00e8que]]s. Another recording of Lewis playing an instrumental boogie arrangement of the [[Glenn Miller Orchestra]] favorite \"[[In the Mood]]\" was issued on the [[Phillips International Records|Phillips International]] label under the pseudonym \"The Hawk\".{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n===Smash Records===\nLewis's Sun recording contract ended in 1963, and he joined [[Smash Records]], where he made a number of rock recordings that did not further his career. The team at Smash (a division of [[Mercury Records]]) came up with \"I'm on Fire\", a song that they felt would be perfect for Lewis and, as Colin Escott writes in the sleeve to the retrospective ''A Half Century of Hits'', \"Mercury held the presses, thinking they had found Lewis's comeback hit, and it might have happened if the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] hadn't arrived in [[United States|America]], changing radio playlists almost overnight. Mercury didn't really know what to do with Lewis after that.\" One of Smash's first decisions was to record a retread of his Sun hits, ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'' which was inspired by the continuing enthusiasm UK and European fans had shown for Lewis's firebrand rock and roll. In June 1963, Lewis returned to the UK for the first time since the scandal that nearly ended his career five years earlier, to headline a performance on the ''[[MV Royal Daffodil (1939)|MV Royal Daffodil]]'', for a [[English Channel|cross-channel]] rock and roll cruise from [[Southend-on-Sea|Southend, Essex, UK]] to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne, France]]. For this performance, he was backed by [[Ritchie Blackmore]] and [[The Outlaws (band)|The Outlaws]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1f53kihTyRMC&pg=PA100-IA5&lpg=PA100-IA5&dq=June+1,+1963+MV+Royal+Daffodil&source=bl&ots=1plPKgdfGi&sig=ACfU3U3_bMWR5SZWQPo65mvpuHZFyRMK9g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjR8pqe_ZDoAhXZHzQIHcKwCtIQ6AEwAHoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&q=June%201%2C%201963%20MV%20Royal%20Daffodil&f=false ''Black Knight: Ritchie Blackmore'' by Jerry Bloom]</ref> However, despite his successful live tours, none of Lewis's early Smash albums, including ''[[The Return of Rock]]'', ''Memphis Beat'', and ''[[Soul My Way]]'', were commercial successes. \n\n===''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg''===\nOne major success during these lost years was the concert album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'', recorded with the [[The Nashville Teens|Nashville Teens]] in 1964, which is considered one of the greatest live rock-and-roll albums ever.<ref name=\"Checksfield\"/><ref name=\"Q-2002\"/><ref name=\"Mojo-2004\"/><ref name=\"AMG-Erlewine\"/><ref name=\"Rolling-Stone-2009\">\n{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jerryleelewis/albums/album/284513/review/5940644/live_at_the_star_club_hamburg_bear_family |title=Jerry Lee Lewis: Live at the Star Club, Hamburg [Bear Family] |accessdate=February 18, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910033507/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jerryleelewis/albums/album/284513/review/5940644/live_at_the_star_club_hamburg_bear_family |archivedate=September 10, 2009}}</ref> In [[Joe Bonomo]]'s book ''Lost and Found'', producer Siggi Loch stated that the recording setup was uncomplicated, with microphones placed as close to the instruments as possible and a stereo mic placed in the audience to capture the ambience. The results were sonically astonishing, with Bonomo observing, \"Detractors complain of the album's crashing noisiness, the lack of subtlety with which Jerry Lee revisits the songs, the fact that the piano is mixed too loudly, but what is certain is that Siggi Loch on this spring evening captured something brutally honest about the Killer, about the primal and timeless center of the very best rock & roll...\" The album showcases Lewis's skills as a pianist and singer, honed by relentless touring. In a 5-out-of-5-stars review, Milo Miles wrote in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine that \"''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg'' is not an album, it's a crime scene: Jerry Lee Lewis slaughters his rivals in a thirteen-song set that feels like one long convulsion.\" Due to legal constraints, the album was not released in the United States at the time.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n===Country comeback===\n[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis performing with [[Carl Perkins]], [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Johnny Cash]] on ''The Johnny Cash Christmas Special'' in November 1977]]\nFrustrated by Smash's inability to score a hit, Lewis was nearing the end of his contract when promotions manager [[Eddie Kilroy]] called him and pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the Jerry Chestnut song \"[[Another Place, Another Time]]\", which was released as a single on March 9, 1968, and, to everyone's amazement, shot up the country charts. At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing [[Iago]] in a rock and roll adaptation of ''Othello'' called ''Catch My Soul'' in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer [[Jerry Kennedy]]. What followed was a string of hits that no one could have ever predicted, although country music had always remained a major part of Lewis's repertoire. As Colin Escott observes in the sleeve to the 1995 compilation ''Killer Country'', the conversion to country music in 1968 \"looked at the time like a radical shift, but it was neither as abrupt nor as unexpected as it seemed. Jerry had always recorded country music, and his country breakthrough 'Another Place, Another Time' had been preceded by many, many country records starting with his first, '[[Crazy Arms]]', in 1956.\" The last time Lewis had a song on the country charts was with \"Pen and Paper\" in 1964, which had reached number 36, but \"Another Place, Another Time\" would go all the way to number 4 and remain on the charts for 17 weeks.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, including four chart toppers. Hits include \"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)\", \"To Make Love Sweeter For You\", \"She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)\", \"Since I Met You Baby\", \"Once More With Feeling\", \"One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)\", and \"Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough\". The production on his early country albums, such as ''[[Another Place, Another Time]]'' and ''She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye'', was sparse, quite different from the slick \"[[Nashville sound]]\" that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. The songs still featured Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as [[George Jones]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. In his book ''Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story'', biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording \"were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio\".\n\nIn a remarkable turnaround, Lewis became the most bankable country star in the world. He was so huge in 1970 that his former Smash producer [[Shelby Singleton]], who purchased [[Sun Records]] from [[Sam Phillips]] in July 1969, wasted no time in repackaging many of Lewis's old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases. One of his latter unreleased Sun recordings, \"[[One Minute Past Eternity]],\" was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart, following Lewis's recent [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] hit \"She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye.\" Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following ''The Golden Cream of the Country'' with ''[[A Taste of Country]]'' later in 1970.\n\n===Grand Ole Opry appearance===\nLewis played the [[Grand Ole Opry]] for the first and only time on January 20, 1973. As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to ''A Half Century of Hits'', Lewis had always maintained ambivalent feelings towards [[Nashville, Tennessee|Music City]] ever since he'd been turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at [[Sun Records]]: \"It was 18 years since he had left [[Nashville]] broke and disheartened... Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. He didn't move there and didn't schmooze there. He didn't fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren't necessarily worse, but they were different.\"\n\nAs recounted in a 2015 online ''Rolling Stone'' article by Beville Dunkerly, Lewis opened with his comeback single \"Another Place, Another Time\". Ignoring his allotted time constraints&mdash;and, thus, commercial breaks&mdash;Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight minutes of stage time maximum) and invited [[Del Wood]]&mdash;the one member of the Opry who had been kind to him when he had been there as a teenager&mdash;out on stage to sing with him. He also blasted through \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On\", \"Workin' Man Blues\", \"[[Good Golly Miss Molly]]\", and a host of other classics before leaving the stage to a thunderous standing ovation.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===''The Session'' and ''Southern Roots''===\nLewis returned to the pop charts with \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\" in 1971 and \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" in 1972, and this turn of events, coupled with a revitalized public interest in vintage [[rock and roll]], inspired Mercury to fly Lewis to London in 1973 to record with a cadre of gifted British and Irish musicians, including [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Kenney Jones]], and Albert Lee. By all accounts the sessions were tense. The remake of Lewis's old Sun cut \"Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" would be the album's hit single, reaching number 20 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and peaking at number 41 on the pop chart. ''The Session'' would be Lewis's highest pop charting album since 1964's ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'', hitting number 37. It did far better on the country albums chart, rising to number 4. Later that same year, he went to Memphis and recorded ''[[Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis]]'', a soul-infused rock album produced by Huey Meaux.\n\nAccording to Rick Bragg's authorized 2014 biography, \"the Killer\" was in a foul mood when he showed up at Trans Maximus Studios in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to record: \"During these sessions, he insulted the producer, threatened to kill a photographer, and drank and medicated his way into but not out of a fog.\" During one exchange that can be heard on the 2013 reissue ''Southern Roots: The Original Sessions'', Meaux asks Lewis, \"Do you wanna try one?\", meaning a take, to which Lewis replies, \"If you got enough fuckin' sense to cut it.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Lewis was still pumping out country albums, although the hits were beginning to dry up. His last big hit with Mercury was \"Middle Age Crazy,\" which made it to number 4 in 1977.\n[[File:JerryLee Lewis 1973.jpg|thumb|right|Lewis performing in 1977]]\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Jerry Lee Lewis @ Credicard Hall 01 (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|Lewis performing in 2009]]\nIn 1979, Lewis switched to [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] and produced the critically acclaimed ''Jerry Lee Lewis'', although sales were disappointing. In 1986, Lewis was one of the inaugural inductees into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Although looking frail after several hospitalizations due to stomach problems, Lewis was responsible for beginning an unplanned jam at the end of the evening, which was immediately incorporated into the event. That year, he returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to team up with Orbison, Cash, and Perkins along with longtime admirers like [[John Fogerty]] to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]'', a sort of followup to the [[Million Dollar Quartet]] session, though in the eyes of many critics and fans, lacking the spirit of the old days at Sun.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 1989, a major motion picture based on his early life in rock and roll, ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'', brought him back into the public eye, especially when he decided to re-record all his songs for the movie soundtrack. The film was based on the book by Lewis's ex-wife, Myra Gale Lewis, and starred [[Dennis Quaid]] as Lewis, [[Winona Ryder]] as Myra, and [[Alec Baldwin]] as Jimmy Swaggart. The movie focuses on Lewis's early career and his relationship with Myra, and ends with the scandal of the late 1950s. A year later, in 1990, Lewis made minor news when a new song he recorded called \"It Was the Whiskey Talkin' (Not Me)\" was included in the soundtrack to the hit movie ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. The song is also heard in the movie, playing on a radio. The public downfall of his cousin, television evangelist [[Jimmy Swaggart]], resulted in more adverse publicity to a troubled family. Swaggart is also a piano player, as is another cousin, country music star [[Mickey Gilley]]. All three listened to the same music in their youth, and frequented Haney's Big House, the Ferriday club that featured black blues acts. Lewis and Swaggart have had a complex relationship over the years.\n\n[[File:JerryLeeLewis.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis performing at the Rhythm Festival in [[Bedford, England]] in 2006]]\nIn 1998, Lewis toured Europe with [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} On February 12, 2005, he was given a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] by [[The Recording Academy]].<ref name=\":2\" /> On September 26, 2006, a new album titled ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'' was released, featuring many of rock and roll's elite as guest stars.

My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that.\" Lewis is primarily known for his \"boogie woogie\" style, which is characterized by a regular left hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. Appearing on ''Memphis Sounds with [[George Klein (disc jockey)|George Klein]]'' in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, \"He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice looking man, carried himself real well. I miss Carl very much.\" Lewis also cited [[Moon Mullican]] as a source of inspiration.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nAlthough Lewis's piano playing is commonly labeled boogie woogie, gospel music was another major influence in the formation of his technique. In Joe Bonomo's 2009 book ''Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found'', Memphis producer and musician [[Jim Dickinson]] calls Lewis's occasional penchant for interrupting the standard boogie woogie left-hand progression by omitting the seventh and repeating the fifth and sixth, creating a repetitive, driving, quasi-menacing momentum, \"revolutionary, almost inexplicable. Maybe [[Ella Mae Morse]], maybe Moon Mullican had done it, but not in a way that became the propelling force of the song. Rock and roll piano up to that point had been defined by Rosco Gordon, [[Ike Turner]], and to an extent, Ray Charles. None of them were doing that.

Lewis had a recorded argument with [[Sam Phillips]] during the recording session for \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", a song he initially refused to record because he considered it blasphemous (\"How can\u2026  How can the devil save souls?  What are you ''talkin' about''?\" he asks Phillips during one heated exchange.) During the famous [[Million Dollar Quartet]] jam involving Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, they performed several gospel songs. Lewis's biographer [[Rick Bragg]] explains that part of the reason the recording only features Lewis and Elvis singing is because \"only Elvis and Jerry Lee [were] raised in the [[Assemblies of God |Assembly of God]]\", and {{\"'}}Johnny and Carl didn't really know the words\u2026  they was [[Baptists]]', [Lewis] said, and therefore deprived.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bragg|first=Rick |authorlink=Rick Bragg|title=Jerry Lee and Me|journal= [[Garden & Gun]]|date=October\u2013November 2014|url= http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |accessdate=October 7, 2015 |url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151121073447/http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |archivedate= November 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990 documentary ''The Jerry Lee Lewis Story'', Lewis said to the interviewer, \"The Bible don't even speak of religion.

I find myself falling short of the glory of God.\"\n\nGospel music was a staple of his performing repertoire.

Later that night, Lewis was at a [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] nightclub called Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new [[Lincoln Continental]] with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before three o'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates.\n\nPresley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle out the car window, not realizing the window was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but \"Elvis, watching on the [[closed-circuit television]], told guards to call the police. The Memphis police found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening them, away in handcuffs.\" Lewis said, \"The cops asked Elvis, 'What do you want us to do? And Elvis told 'em, 'Lock him up.' That hurt my feelings. To be scared of me \u2013 knowin' me the way he did \u2013 was ridiculous.\" Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mugshot was wired around the world.
