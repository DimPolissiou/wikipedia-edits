It is dedicated to the memory of [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]], an American patron of chamber music.  Poulenc composed it for the flautist [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]], and he and Rampal gave the premi\u00e8re in June 1957 at the [[Strasbourg Music Festival]]. It is now one of Poulenc's best known works and is a prominent feature in 20th-century flute repertoire.\n\n==Background and first performance==\nPoulenc began to think of writing a flute sonata in 1952, but he was occupied with his Sonata for Two Pianos and then his opera, ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites]]''.<ref name=nimbus>Clements, Dominy (2015).

It begins with two quavers on the piano, which are echoed by the flute during the course of the next two bars. The haunting tune features minimal decoration, and is accompanied by flowing quavers on the piano. In the middle of the piece, the atmosphere suddenly changes to loud high notes on the flute, reaching a top B. However soon after it returns to the original slow tune. \n\n===''Presto giocoso''===\nThis movement is predominantly loud and fast, and Poulenc's \"trademark motif\" mentioned above reappears in the contrasting central section.\n\n==Later concert performances and recordings==\nPoulenc considered giving the American premiere together with Rampal during a planned US tour, but the tour did not take place and Rampal gave the American premiere in February 1958 with his regular accompanist [[Robert Veyron-Lacroix]].<ref>Schmidt (2002), p. 464</ref> Poulenc was pleased to accompany other flautists in the sonata.

A large number of efforts toward the total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide were directed by its interesting biological activities and extreme scarcity of natural sources (0.002% w/w from frozen marine sponge). The compound supply necessary for complete [[clinical trial]]s cannot be met by harvesting, isolation, and purification. As of 2005, attempts at synthesis or semi-synthesis by [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] have proven unsuccessful. As a result, all discodermolide used in preclinical studies and clinical trials has come from large-scale total synthesis.<ref>Mickel, S. J. ''et al.'' Org. Process Res. Dev. 2004, 8</ref>\n\n==History==\nDiscodermolide was first isolated in 1990 from the [[Caribbean]] [[marine sponge]] Discodermia dissoluta by chemist Dr. Sarath Gunasekera and biologist Dr. Ross Longley,  scientists at the [[Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution]].<ref name=\"gunasekera\" /> The sponge contained 0.002% of discodermolide (7&nbsp;mg/434 g of sponge). Since the compound is light-sensitive, the sponge must be harvested at a minimum depth of 33 meters. Discodermolide was initially found to have [[immunosuppressive]] and [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] activities.\n\n==Structure==\n(+)-discodermolide has a linear polypropionate backbone, punctuated by Z-olefinic linkages at C(8,9) and C(13,14), a terminal Z-diene substituent at C(21\u201324), 13 stereogenic centers (including four secondary hydroxyls and seven methyl substituents), a [[carbamate]], and a fully substituted D-[[lactone]]. The relative stereochemistry was determined by [[X-ray crystallography]].<ref name=\"gunasekera\" /> The absolute stereochemistry of (+)-discodermolide was reported by [[Stuart Schreiber|Schreiber]] and his co-workers in 1993.<ref name=\"nerenberg\">Nerenberg, J. B.; Hung, D. T.; Somers, P. K.; Schreiber, S. L. J. Am. Chem.

In both human peripheral blood [[leukocytes]] and [[murine]] [[splenocyte]]s, (+)-discodermolide was found to suppress the two-way mixed [[lymphocyte]] reaction. In addition, mitogenic response of [[peripheral]] blood [[leukocytes]] was also suppressed by the (+)-discodermolide. Follow up experiments demonstrated that (+)-discodermolide also has anti-proliferative effects in several other non-[[lymphoid]] [[cell lines]].\n\n=== Antiproliferative and antimitotic properties===\n(+)-Discodermolide is a highly potent [[antiproliferative]] agent.<ref name=\"longley5\" /> (+)-Discodermolide treated murine Do11.10T hybridoma cells could not proceed normal cell cycling.  In untreated controls, 68% of cells were found at G1 phase, and 31% were found at S phase, and less than 1% was found at the G2/M phase. However, after 3 hours  (+)-discodermolide treatment, 52% were found at  G1 phase, 40% at S phase, and 58% at G2 and M phase. This result indicated that (+)-discodermolide blocks the [[cell cycle]] at G2 and M phase. This inhibition effect was  also found to be reversible. Cells resume normal cycling within 48 hours after removal of (+)-discodermolide from the cell culture medium.\n(+)-Discodermolide arrests cell cycle via binding and stabilization of the [[microtubule]] network.  Hyper-stabilization of the mitotic spindle causes cell cycle arresting at G2 and M phase and eventually leads to cell death by [[apoptosis]]. At 10\u00b5M concentration, (+)-discodermolide is able to promote [[microtubules]] assembly without [[microtubule]]-associated proteins and GTP. With [[microtubule]]-associated protein and [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] presented, 10\u00b5M (+)-discodermolide is able to initiate [[tubulin]] [[polymerization]] at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>ter Haar, E.; Kowalski, R.

(+)-Discodermolide also induced up-regulation and activation in three proteins (p66Shc, Erk1, and Erk2).\n\n=== Neuroprotective agent===\n(+)-Discodermolide has also been found to be [[neuroprotective]] in recent Alzheimer research.<ref>Forman, M.

In transgenic mouse model for human [[tauopathy]], (+)-discodermolide stabilizes [[microtubules]] and restores fast [[axonal]] transport in cells, offsetting the loss of function caused by aggregation of [[tau protein]]. The motor-impaired mice exhibited a full restoration of normal movement with (+)-discodermolide treatment.\n\n=== Potent natural promoter of tubulin assembly===\nDiscodermolide competes with [[paclitaxel]]<ref>Martello, L.

Discodermolide also seems to demonstrate a remarkably consistent 3D molecular conformation in the solid-state, in solution and when bound to [[tubulin]]; molecules with the conformational flexibility of discodermolide usually present very different conformations in different environments.\n[[File:lung cancer cells treated with discodermolide.jpg|thumb|center|600px|Confocal images of human lung cancer cells treated with discodermolide.

Finding the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of a sponge derived polyketides is a difficult task to accomplish because of the sponges\u2019 colonial nature Scientists are not yet able to culture the sponges; therefore, the genes for the biosynthesis of (+)-discodermolide have not yet been discovered.<ref>Shaw, S. J.; Zhang, D.; Sundermann, K. F.; Myles, D. C. Fragment Assembly: An Alternative Approach to Generating Complex Polyketides. Synthetic Commun. 2005, 35, 1735-1743.</ref>\n\n==Total syntheses==\nAn intense effort has been made towards the total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide in order to meet the growing interest of studying its [[clinical trial|clinical]] profile. More than dozens of syntheses have been published by different research groups. After decade of work, discodermolide syntheses have become more convergent and more practical. All of the total syntheses approaches started with the construction of three major fragments of roughly equivalent complexity, each of which contains the methyl-hydroxyl-methyl [[Catalytic triad|triad]] of contiguous centers that matches the stereogenicity of discodermolide target. Here are three examples of the retrosynthetic analyses of (+)-discodermolide:\n\n[[File:retrosynthetic analyses of discodermolide.png|frameless|center|853px]]\n\n=== Total syntheses of unnatural antipode (-)-discodermolide ===\n\n==== The Schreiber synthesis of (-)-discodermolide====\n\nIn 1993, Schreiber and his co-workers<ref name=\"nerenberg\" /> reported the first total synthesis of the unnatural antipode (-)-discodermolide and determined the absolute stereochemistry of the natural product. The Schreiber team recognized three fragments of roughly equal complexity that are separated by olefinic units in discodermolide.  The two starting materials, homoallylic alcohols, are both readily derived from 3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate.\n\nThe trisubstituted (Z)-alkene of first fragment was generated by using the Still-Gennari reagent. Gilbert's reagent was then used to [[homologate]] it to an [[acetylene]]. Goekjian and Kishi method was then used to get the desired fragment, iodoacetylene. The same homoallylic alcohol was converted to [[diol]] in four steps. After oxidation to keto-[[aldehyde]], it was homololated to dienes by a palladium-catalyzed coupling with vinylzinc bromide to generated the second fragment.  The six-membered ring subunit was transformed from an acetal, which was obtained by an intramolecular 1,4-addition of a presumed [[hemiacetal]] intermediate.\n\n[[File:The Schreiber synthesis of (-)-discodermolide fragment.png|frameless|center|863px]]\n\nThe Schreiber team found that the NiCl2 and CrCl2 promoted addition of alkynyl iodide to aldehyde effectively. The reaction provides a 2:1 mixture of desired product and its [[isomer]]. However, the undesired isomer can be recycled to the desired epimer in three steps, including [[Swern oxidation]] and Corey's [[asymmetric reduction]]. Pd catalyzed partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to establish the Z-configuration at C(8)\u2013C(9). The pivaloyloxy group was then converted to a bromide for the final coupling. A stereoselective [[enolate]] [[alkylation]] between the allylic bromide with the lithium enolate derived from the second fragment provided a 3:1 mixture of [[isomers]] and completed the backbone assembly of (-)-discodermolide. During the final conversion, the [[NaBH4]] reduction of ketone provided a separable 2.5:1 mixture of isomers. The Schreiber synthesis of (-)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 3.2% with a longest linear sequence of 24 steps and 36 total steps. In 1996, the Schreiber group published the total synthesis of natural discodermolide with similar synthetic strategy (4.3% overall yield, 36 steps, 24 steps longest linear sequence.\n\n[[File:The Schreiber synthesis of (-)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|708px]]\n\n==== The first-generation Smith synthesis of (-)-discodermolide====\n\nIn 1995, Smith and his co-workers<ref>Smith, A. B., III; Qiu, Y.; Jones, D. R.; Kobayashi, K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 12011\u201312012</ref> reported the second total synthesis of (-)-discodermolide. Smith adapted the triply convergent strategy of the Schreiber synthesis. In Smith's strategy, all three fragments shared a common [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]], which was the product of a highly efficient 50g scale five-step conversion from [[3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate]] with 59% yield. An Evans syn [[aldol reaction]] was utilized to obtain the desired stereochemical outcome.\n\nThe synthesis of fragment A, alkyl iodide, applied the Evans' acyl [[oxazolidinone]] method. After hydroxyl protection and reductive removal of the [[chiral auxiliary]], an [[iodination]] was carried out to afford fragment A. The preparation of fragment B began with TBS protection and [[DIBAL]] reduction. The resulting aldehyde can be converted to desired Z-trisubstituted [[vinyl halide]] with 6:1 selectivity. The key feature of the synthesis of fragment C was the addition of the anion derived from dithiane to [[benzyl]] [[glycidyl]] [[ether]].\n\n[[File:The Smith synthesis of (-)-discodermolide fragment.png|frameless|center|900px]]\n\nPalladium(0)-mediated [[crosscoupling]] of [[vinyl group|vinyl]] iodide with the organozinc derivative of alkyl iodide afford product in 66% yield. After a two-step conversion to the corresponding [[phosphonium]] salt, wittig union of phosphonium salt with aldehyde, fragment C, proceeded in 76% yield and good selectivity. The last feature of this synthesis was the [[titanium]]-mediated installation of the [[diene]]. The smith synthesis of (-)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 2.0% with a longest linear sequence of 29 steps and 42 total steps.\n\n[[File:The Smith synthesis of (-)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|764px]]\n\n==== The Myles synthesis of (-)-discodermolide====\nIn 1997, Myles and his co-workers<ref>Harried, S. S.; Yang, G.; Strawn, M. A.; Myles, D. C. J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 6098\u20136099</ref>  has described the total synthesis of (-)-discodermolide using [[chelation]]-controlled [[alkylation]] as the key coupling. The titanium-mediated hetero-[[Diels\u2013Alder reaction]] of aldehyde with the [[Danishefsky diene]] successfully produced the challenging Z-trisubstituted C(13)\u2013C(14) olefin in allylic iodide fragment. The stereogenicity in the C(16)\u2013C(21) subunit was induced by employing Evans\naldol chemistry. The stereogenicity of the final fragment was set by a [[tin]]-promoted [[asymmetric allylation]]. Notably, the correct oxidation state at C(1) of this fragment would reduce the number of steps after the coupling of fragments. The Myles synthesis of (-)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 1.5% with a longest linear sequence of 25 steps and 44 total steps.\n\n[[File:The Myles synthesis of (-)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|825px]]\n\n=== Total syntheses of natural antipode (+)-discodermolide===\n\n==== The Marshall synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\n\nMarshall and his co-workers<ref>Marshall, J. A.; Johns, B. A. J. Org. Chem. 1998, 63, 7885\u20137892</ref> used their asymmetric allenylmetal-homoaldol tactic to construct polypropionate frameworks of (+)-discodermolide. The novelty of the Marshall approach is that the three stereotriad subunits are assembled through addition of non-[[racemic]] allenylmetal reagents to (S)-3-silyloxy-2-methylpropanal to generate both syn/syn and syn/anti adducts. The central feature for the synthesis of the alkyl iodide fragment was the treatment of aldehyde to allenyltributylstannane in the presence of [[Boron trifluoride|BF3]]-etherate to get the syn/syn isomer. Syn/anti methyl-hydroxyl-methyl stereotriads were obtained through the reaction between aldehyde and homochiral allenylzinc reagent.\n\n[[File:The Marshall synthesis of (+)-discodermolide fragment.png|frameless|center|692px]]\n\nIn the Marshall synthesis, the coupling between the alkyne fragment to the aldehyde fragment proceeded in 92% yield, with 85:15 [[diastereoselectivity]]. The condensation of aldehyde with iodoethylidene triphenylphosphorane was the most challenging step, which produce 40% yield and an 85:15 inseparable mixture of (Z) and (E) isomers. The last coupling was performed via a [[Suzuki]] union of vinyl iodide with the boronate derived of alkyl iodide. The Marshall synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 1.3% with a longest linear sequence of 30 steps and 48 total steps.\n\n[[File:The Marshall synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|664px]]\n\n==== The Evans synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\n\nEvans and his co-workers<ref>Halstead, D. P. Ph.D. Thesis, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, 1999</ref>  has developed a strategy that relies heavily on [[asymmetric aldol]] methodology for the production of the polypropionate backbone. They used a Claisen condensation reaction to construct the C(13)\u2013C(14) trisubstituted Z-olefin. The Evans synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 6.4% with a longest linear sequence of 31 steps and 49 total steps.\n\n[[File:The Evans synthesis of (+)-discodermolide fragment.png|frameless|center|491px]]\n[[File:The Evans synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|499px]]\n\n==== The Smith gram-scale synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\n\nIn 1999, Smith and his co-workers<ref>Smith, A. B., III; Kaufman, M. D.; Beauchamp, T. J.; LaMarche, M. J.; Arimoto, H. Org. Lett. 1999, 1, 1823\u20131826</ref> reported the first gram-scale synthesis of (+)-discodermolide, which make the development of (+)-discodermolide as a potential [[chemotherapeutic]] agent possible. This synthetic route was licensed to [[Novartis Pharmaceuticals]]. One of the major improvements was that no purification was required in the first four steps of the five-step sequence towards the common precursor as the intermediate, aldol adduct, is a [[crystalline]] solid. A [[chelation]]-controlled Mukaiyama-[[aldol reaction]] was used to set the stereogenicity at C(5) of the [[lactone]] fragment.\n[[File:The Smith gram-scale synthesis of (+)-discodermolide fragment.png|frameless|center|550px]]\nTwo years later, Smith and his co-workers publish a third-generation synthesis in which the bulky TBS ether protecting group at C(11) of the [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] iodide was replaced by a less sterically encumbering group, MOM.  This modification favors the formation of the desired [[phosphonium]] salt. The Smith third-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 6.0% with a longest linear sequence of 21 steps and 35 total steps.\n[[File:The Smith gram-scale synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|675px]]\n\n==== The fourth-generation Smith synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\nThe key feature of the fourth-generation<ref>Smith, A. B., III; Freeze, B. S.; Xian, M.; Hirose, T. Org. Lett. 2005, 7, 1825\u20131828</ref> approach was the utilization of bidirectional fragment, vinyl iodide/phosphonium salt. [[phosphonium]] salt could be readily obtained as the trisubstituted [[vinyl group|vinyl]] iodide is less reactive than [[alkyl]] iodide. A Wittig reaction with followed by [[Suzuki coupling]] with alkyl iodide efficiently furnished the backbone of (+)-discodermolide. The Smith fourth-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 9.0% with a longest linear sequence of 17 steps and 36 total steps. \n[[File:The fourth-generation Smith synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|690px]]\n\n==== The first-generation Paterson synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\nPaterson and his co-workers<ref>Paterson, I.; Florence, G. J.; Gerlach, K.; Scott, J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2000, 39, 377\u2013380</ref> at the [[University of Cambridge]] have developed a strategy which utilizes novel [[chelation]]-controlled and reagent-controlled [[aldol reactions]] with high [[Stereoselectivity|selectivity]] for subunit connections. Another feature of this synthesis was the induction of C(8)-C(9) olefin with cis geometry via Still-Gennari [[Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction]]. The Paterson first-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 10.3% with a longest linear sequence of 23 steps and 42 total steps.\n[[File:The first-generation Paterson synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|744px]]\n\n==== The second- and third-generation Paterson syntheses of (+)-discodermolide====\nIn 2003, Paterson and co-workers<ref>Paterson, I.; Delgado, O.; Florence, G. J.; Lyothier, I.; Scott, J. P.; Sereinig, N. Org. Lett. 2003, 5, 35\u201338</ref>  reported a strategy that relies heavily on substrate-derived stereocontrol. Instead of a reagent-controlled aldol reaction in Paterson first-generation synthesis, a dicyclohexylboron-mediated anti-aldol was used to connect C(5)-C(6), which leads to a significant increase in [[diastereoselectivity]] from 4:1 to 92:8. Notably, Still\u2013Gennari modified [[Horner\u2013Wadsworth\u2013Emmons reaction]] was also used to construct the C(13)-C(14) trisubstituted [[olefin]] in early stage of this synthesis. The Paterson second-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 7.8% with a longest linear sequence of 24 steps and 35 total steps.\n[[File:The second-generation Paterson syntheses of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|650px]]\n\nIn 2004, Paterson and his co-workers<ref>Paterson, I.; Lyothier, I. Org. Lett. 2004, 6, 4933\u20134936</ref> disclosed the third-generation total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide. The stepwise method used in previous generations to incorporate the C(1)\u2013C(8) subunit was replaced by a late-stage Still-Gennari olefination, which leads to a notable improvement in [[convergence (chemistry)|convergence]]. The Paterson third-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 11.1% (highest reported to date) with a longest linear sequence of 21 steps and 37 total steps.\n[[File:The third-generation Paterson syntheses of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|589px]]\n\n==== The Novartis 60-g total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\nIn early 2004, [[Novartis Pharmaceuticals]]<ref>Mickel, S. J.; Niederer, D.; Daeffler, R.; Osmani, A.; Kuesters, E.; Schmid, E.; Schaer, K.; Gamboni, R.; Chen, W.; Loeser, E.; Kinder, F. R., Jr.; Konigsberger, K.; Prasad, K.; Ramsey, T. M.; Repic, O.; Wang, R.-M.; Florence, G.; Lyothier, I.; Paterson, I. Org. Process Res. Dev. 2004, 8, 122\u2013130</ref>  have disclosed the detail of a 60g-scale synthesis of (+)-discodermolide. This synthesis utilized the Smith gram-scale approach and the Paterson first-generation endgame. This synthesis allows (+)-discodermolide to be evaluated as an [[in vivo]] [[chemotherapeutic]] agent for adult [[patient]]s presenting with advanced solid [[malignancies]] in [[Phase I clinical trial]]s. The Novartis synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 0.65% with a longest linear sequence of 26 steps and 33 total steps.\n\n[[File:The Novartis 60-g total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|640px]]\n\n==== The Panek total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\nIn 2004, Panek and his co-workers<ref>Arefolov, A.; Panek, J. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 5596\u20135603</ref>  reported an approach which takes advantage of chiral [[crotylsilane]]-based C-C bond construction methodology to obtain the absolute stereochemistry of the three subunits of (+)-discodermolide. One of the key features of the Paterson approach is the utilization of [[hydrozirconation]]-cross-coupling methodology for the construction of C13-C14 (Z)-olefin. Acetate [[aldol reaction]] with high levels of 1,5-anti stereo induction and  [[palladium]]-mediated sp2-sp3 cross coupling reaction are used to connect subunits. The Panek synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 2.1% with a longest linear sequence of 27 steps and 42 total steps.\n\n[[File:The Panek total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|500px]]\n\n==== The Ardisson total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\nIn 2008, Ardisson and his co-workers<ref>de Lemos, Elsa; Poree, Francois-Hugues; Bourin, Arnaud; Barbion, Julien; Agouridas, Evangelos; Lannou, Marie-Isabelle; Commercon, Alain; Betzer, Jean-Francois; Pancrazi, Ange; Ardisson, Janick. Chemistry - A European Journal (2008), 14(35), 11092-11112</ref> reported a strategy that applies a [[crotyltitanation]] reaction repeatedly to yield homoallylic (Z)-O-ene-carbamate alcohols with excellent selectivity. This [[crotyltitanation]] reaction not only efficiently produces the syn-anti methyl-hydroxy-methyl triads of (+)-discodermolide, but also yields products that can be easily converted to terminal (Z)-[[diene]]. The C13-C14 (Z)-olefin is installed through a highly selective [[dyotropic]] rearrangement.  The Ardission synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 1.6% with a longest linear sequence of 21 steps. \n[[File:The Ardisson total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|620px]]\n\n==Clinical development==\nThe [[Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution]] licensed (+)-discodermolide to [[Novartis]], which began a phase 1 [[clinical trial]] in 2004.

A large number of efforts toward the total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide were directed by its interesting biological activities and extreme scarcity of natural sources (0.002% w/w from frozen marine sponge). The compound supply necessary for complete [[clinical trial]]s cannot be met by harvesting, isolation, and purification. As of 2005, attempts at synthesis or semi-synthesis by [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] have proven unsuccessful. As a result, all discodermolide used in preclinical studies and clinical trials has come from large-scale total synthesis.<ref>Mickel, S. J. ''et al.'' Org. Process Res. Dev. 2004, 8</ref>\n\n==History==\nDiscodermolide was first isolated in 1990 from the [[Caribbean]] [[marine sponge]] Discodermia dissoluta by chemist Dr. Sarath Gunasekera and biologist Dr. Ross Longley,  scientists at the [[Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution]].<ref name=\"gunasekera\" /> The sponge contained 0.002% of discodermolide (7&nbsp;mg/434 g of sponge). Since the compound is light-sensitive, the sponge must be harvested at a minimum depth of 33 meters. Discodermolide was initially found to have [[immunosuppressive]] and [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] activities.\n\n==Structure==\n(+)-discodermolide has a linear polypropionate backbone, punctuated by Z-olefinic linkages at C(8,9) and C(13,14), a terminal Z-diene substituent at C(21\u201324), 13 stereogenic centers (including four secondary hydroxyls and seven methyl substituents), a [[carbamate]], and a fully substituted D-[[lactone]]. The relative stereochemistry was determined by [[X-ray crystallography]].<ref name=\"gunasekera\" /> The absolute stereochemistry of (+)-discodermolide was reported by [[Stuart Schreiber|Schreiber]] and his co-workers in 1993.<ref name=\"nerenberg\">Nerenberg, J. B.; Hung, D. T.; Somers, P. K.; Schreiber, S. L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 12621\u201312622</ref> Discodermolide adopts a U-shaped [[conformational isomerism|conformation]], where the internal (Z)-alkenes act as conformational locks by minimizing [[allylic]] strain and syn-[[pentane]] interactions along the backbone. The D-[[lactone]] is held in a boat-like [[conformational isomerism|conformation]].\n[[File:Discodermolide_enum.svg|frameless|center|250px]]\n\n==Biological activities==\n\n=== Immunosuppressive properties===\nInitial biological evaluation of (+)-discodermolide by the Longley group showed that it has [[immunosuppressive]] properties both [[in vitro]]<ref name=\"longley2\" /> and [[in vivo]].<ref name=\"longley3\" /> The [[immunosuppression]] response was observed at a relatively low concentration that (+)-discodermolide was non-toxic in vitro. In both human peripheral blood [[leukocytes]] and [[murine]] [[splenocyte]]s, (+)-discodermolide was found to suppress the two-way mixed [[lymphocyte]] reaction. In addition, mitogenic response of [[peripheral]] blood [[leukocytes]] was also suppressed by the (+)-discodermolide. Follow up experiments demonstrated that (+)-discodermolide also has anti-proliferative effects in several other non-[[lymphoid]] [[cell lines]].\n\n=== Antiproliferative and antimitotic properties===\n(+)-Discodermolide is a highly potent [[antiproliferative]] agent.<ref name=\"longley5\" /> (+)-Discodermolide treated murine Do11.10T hybridoma cells could not proceed normal cell cycling.  In untreated controls, 68% of cells were found at G1 phase, and 31% were found at S phase, and less than 1% was found at the G2/M phase. However, after 3 hours  (+)-discodermolide treatment, 52% were found at  G1 phase, 40% at S phase, and 58% at G2 and M phase. This result indicated that (+)-discodermolide blocks the [[cell cycle]] at G2 and M phase. This inhibition effect was  also found to be reversible. Cells resume normal cycling within 48 hours after removal of (+)-discodermolide from the cell culture medium.\n(+)-Discodermolide arrests cell cycle via binding and stabilization of the [[microtubule]] network.  Hyper-stabilization of the mitotic spindle causes cell cycle arresting at G2 and M phase and eventually leads to cell death by [[apoptosis]]. At 10\u00b5M concentration, (+)-discodermolide is able to promote [[microtubules]] assembly without [[microtubule]]-associated proteins and GTP. With [[microtubule]]-associated protein and [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] presented, 10\u00b5M (+)-discodermolide is able to initiate [[tubulin]] [[polymerization]] at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>ter Haar, E.; Kowalski, R.

Biol. 1996, 3, 287\u2013293.</ref>\n\n=== Potent Inducer of accelerated cell senescence===\n(+)-Discodermolide is able to induce the [[senescence]] [[phenotype]]. (+)-Discodermolide treated [[HeLa|Hela]], [[MDA-MB-231]], [[HCT116 cells|HCT-116]], and [[A549 (cell line)|A549]] cells<ref name=\"klein\" /> exhibited moderated to high levels of [[\u03b2-galactosidase]] activity in all four cell lines. The \u03b2-galactosidase activity is one of the hallmarks of [[senescence]].<ref>Dimri, G.; Lee, X.; Basile, G.; Acosta, M.; Scott, G.; Roskelley, C.; Medrano, E.; Linskens, M.; Rubelj, I.; Pereira-Smith, O.; Peacocke, M.; Campisi, J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995, 92, 9363\u20139367.</ref> Other common features include a cessation of [[Cell proliferation|proliferation]] and an increased [[cytoplasmic]] area.  (+)-Discodermolide also induced up-regulation and activation in three proteins (p66Shc, Erk1, and Erk2).\n\n=== Neuroprotective agent===\n(+)-Discodermolide has also been found to be [[neuroprotective]] in recent Alzheimer research.<ref>Forman, M. S.; Trojanowski, J. Q.; Lee, V. M.-Y. Nat. Med. 2004, 10, 1055\u20131063</ref> The [[microtubule]]-stabilizing feature of (+)-discodermolide was used to restore neuron functions that have been disrupted by the [[amyloid]] induced sequestration. Tau protein is known to stabilize the [[microtubule]] network in healthy [[neurons]].<ref>Zhang, B.; Maiti, A.; Shively, S.; Lakhani, F.; McDonald- Jones, G.; Bruce, J.; Lee, E. B.; Xie, S. X.; Joyce, S.; Li, C.; Toleikis, P. M.; Lee, V. M.-Y.; Trojanowski, J. Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005, 102, 227\u2013231.</ref> It served as the \u201crailroad track\u201d upon which actin, [[tubulin]], [[mitochondria]], [[neurotransmitter]]-related [[enzymes]] and [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s carrying messenger proteins are delivered. The presence of Amyloid in the cell could lead to tau protein aggregation and [[microtubule]] numbers reduction.  In transgenic mouse model for human [[tauopathy]], (+)-discodermolide stabilizes [[microtubules]] and restores fast [[axonal]] transport in cells, offsetting the loss of function caused by aggregation of [[tau protein]]. The motor-impaired mice exhibited a full restoration of normal movement with (+)-discodermolide treatment.\n\n=== Potent natural promoter of tubulin assembly===\nDiscodermolide competes with [[paclitaxel]]<ref>Martello, L. A.; McDaid, H. M.; Regl, D. L.; Yang, C.-P. H.; Meng, D.; Pettus, T. R. R.; Kaufman, M. D.; Arimoto, H.; Danishefsky, S. J.; Smith, A. B., III; Horwitz, S. B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000, 6, 1978\u20131987</ref> for [[microtubule]] binding, but with higher affinity and is also effective in paclitaxel- and in [[epothilone]]-resistant cancer cells. Discodermolide also seems to demonstrate a remarkably consistent 3D molecular conformation in the solid-state, in solution and when bound to [[tubulin]]; molecules with the conformational flexibility of discodermolide usually present very different conformations in different environments.\n[[File:lung cancer cells treated with discodermolide.jpg|thumb|center|600px|Confocal images of human lung cancer cells treated with discodermolide. Note the extreme rearrangement of the microtubule network and the break down of the cell nucleus. This rearrangement is irreversible and blocks the cell from dividing, and thus eventually leading to cell death.]]\n\n==Biosynthesis==\nMany marine-derived polyketides that are often found  in sponges cannot be cultured out of their natural environment. Finding the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of a sponge derived polyketides is a difficult task to accomplish because of the sponges\u2019 colonial nature Scientists are not yet able to culture the sponges; therefore, the genes for the biosynthesis of (+)-discodermolide have not yet been discovered.<ref>Shaw, S. J.; Zhang, D.; Sundermann, K. F.; Myles, D. C. Fragment Assembly: An Alternative Approach to Generating Complex Polyketides. Synthetic Commun. 2005, 35, 1735-1743.</ref>\n\n==Total syntheses==\nAn intense effort has been made towards the total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide in order to meet the growing interest of studying its [[clinical trial|clinical]] profile. More than dozens of syntheses have been published by different research groups. After decade of work, discodermolide syntheses have become more convergent and more practical. All of the total syntheses approaches started with the construction of three major fragments of roughly equivalent complexity, each of which contains the methyl-hydroxyl-methyl [[Catalytic triad|triad]] of contiguous centers that matches the stereogenicity of discodermolide target. Here are three examples of the retrosynthetic analyses of (+)-discodermolide:\n\n[[File:retrosynthetic analyses of discodermolide.png|frameless|center|853px]]\n\n=== Total syntheses of unnatural antipode (-)-discodermolide ===\n\n==== The Schreiber synthesis of (-)-discodermolide====\n\nIn 1993, Schreiber and his co-workers<ref name=\"nerenberg\" /> reported the first total synthesis of the unnatural antipode (-)-discodermolide and determined the absolute stereochemistry of the natural product. The Schreiber team recognized three fragments of roughly equal complexity that are separated by olefinic units in discodermolide.  The two starting materials, homoallylic alcohols, are both readily derived from 3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate.\n\nThe trisubstituted (Z)-alkene of first fragment was generated by using the Still-Gennari reagent. Gilbert\u2019s reagent was then used to [[homologate]] it to an [[acetylene]]. Goekjian and Kishi method was then used to get the desired fragment, iodoacetylene. The same homoallylic alcohol was converted to [[diol]] in four steps. After oxidation to keto-[[aldehyde]], it was homololated to dienes by a palladium-catalyzed coupling with vinylzinc bromide to generated the second fragment.  The six-membered ring subunit was transformed from an acetal, which was obtained by an intramolecular 1,4-addition of a presumed [[hemiacetal]] intermediate.\n\n[[File:The Schreiber synthesis of (-)-discodermolide fragment.png|frameless|center|863px]]\n\nThe Schreiber team found that the NiCl2 and CrCl2 promoted addition of alkynyl iodide to aldehyde effectively. The reaction provides a 2:1 mixture of desired product and its [[isomer]]. However, the undesired isomer can be recycled to the desired epimer in three steps, including [[Swern oxidation]] and Corey\u2019s [[asymmetric reduction]]. Pd catalyzed partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to establish the Z-configuration at C(8)\u2013C(9). The pivaloyloxy group was then converted to a bromide for the final coupling. A stereoselective [[enolate]] [[alkylation]] between the allylic bromide with the lithium enolate derived from the second fragment provided a 3:1 mixture of [[isomers]] and completed the backbone assembly of (-)-discodermolide. During the final conversion, the [[NaBH4]] reduction of ketone provided a separable 2.5:1 mixture of isomers. The Schreiber synthesis of (-)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 3.2% with a longest linear sequence of 24 steps and 36 total steps. In 1996, the Schreiber group published the total synthesis of natural discodermolide with similar synthetic strategy (4.3% overall yield, 36 steps, 24 steps longest linear sequence.\n\n[[File:The Schreiber synthesis of (-)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|708px]]\n\n==== The first-generation Smith synthesis of (-)-discodermolide====\n\nIn 1995, Smith and his co-workers<ref>Smith, A. B., III; Qiu, Y.; Jones, D. R.; Kobayashi, K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 12011\u201312012</ref> reported the second total synthesis of (-)-discodermolide. Smith adapted the triply convergent strategy of the Schreiber synthesis. In Smith\u2019s strategy, all three fragments shared a common [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]], which was the product of a highly efficient 50g scale five-step conversion from [[3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate]] with 59% yield. An Evans syn [[aldol reaction]] was utilized to obtain the desired stereochemical outcome.\n\nThe synthesis of fragment A, alkyl iodide, applied the Evans' acyl [[oxazolidinone]] method. After hydroxyl protection and reductive removal of the [[chiral auxiliary]], an [[iodination]] was carried out to afford fragment A. The preparation of fragment B began with TBS protection and [[DIBAL]] reduction. The resulting aldehyde can be converted to desired Z-trisubstituted [[vinyl halide]] with 6:1 selectivity. The key feature of the synthesis of fragment C was the addition of the anion derived from dithiane to [[benzyl]] [[glycidyl]] [[ether]].\n\n[[File:The Smith synthesis of (-)-discodermolide fragment.png|frameless|center|900px]]\n\nPalladium(0)-mediated [[crosscoupling]] of [[vinyl group|vinyl]] iodide with the organozinc derivative of alkyl iodide afford product in 66% yield. After a two-step conversion to the corresponding [[phosphonium]] salt, wittig union of phosphonium salt with aldehyde, fragment C, proceeded in 76% yield and good selectivity. The last feature of this synthesis was the [[titanium]]-mediated installation of the [[diene]]. The smith synthesis of (-)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 2.0% with a longest linear sequence of 29 steps and 42 total steps.\n\n[[File:The Smith synthesis of (-)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|764px]]\n\n==== The Myles synthesis of (-)-discodermolide====\nIn 1997, Myles and his co-workers<ref>Harried, S. S.; Yang, G.; Strawn, M. A.; Myles, D. C. J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 6098\u20136099</ref>  has described the total synthesis of (-)-discodermolide using [[chelation]]-controlled [[alkylation]] as the key coupling. The titanium-mediated hetero-[[Diels\u2013Alder reaction]] of aldehyde with the [[Danishefsky diene]] successfully produced the challenging Z-trisubstituted C(13)\u2013C(14) olefin in allylic iodide fragment. The stereogenicity in the C(16)\u2013C(21) subunit was induced by employing Evans\naldol chemistry. The stereogenicity of the final fragment was set by a [[tin]]-promoted [[asymmetric allylation]]. Notably, the correct oxidation state at C(1) of this fragment would reduce the number of steps after the coupling of fragments. The Myles synthesis of (-)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 1.5% with a longest linear sequence of 25 steps and 44 total steps.\n\n[[File:The Myles synthesis of (-)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|825px]]\n\n=== Total syntheses of natural antipode (+)-discodermolide===\n\n==== The Marshall synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\n\nMarshall and his co-workers<ref>Marshall, J. A.; Johns, B. A. J. Org. Chem. 1998, 63, 7885\u20137892</ref> used their asymmetric allenylmetal-homoaldol tactic to construct polypropionate frameworks of (+)-discodermolide. The novelty of the Marshall approach is that the three stereotriad subunits are assembled through addition of non-[[racemic]] allenylmetal reagents to (S)-3-silyloxy-2-methylpropanal to generate both syn/syn and syn/anti adducts. The central feature for the synthesis of the alkyl iodide fragment was the treatment of aldehyde to allenyltributylstannane in the presence of [[Boron trifluoride|BF3]]-etherate to get the syn/syn isomer. Syn/anti methyl-hydroxyl-methyl stereotriads were obtained through the reaction between aldehyde and homochiral allenylzinc reagent.\n\n[[File:The Marshall synthesis of (+)-discodermolide fragment.png|frameless|center|692px]]\n\nIn the Marshall synthesis, the coupling between the alkyne fragment to the aldehyde fragment proceeded in 92% yield, with 85:15 [[diastereoselectivity]]. The condensation of aldehyde with iodoethylidene triphenylphosphorane was the most challenging step, which produce 40% yield and an 85:15 inseparable mixture of (Z) and (E) isomers. The last coupling was performed via a [[Suzuki]] union of vinyl iodide with the boronate derived of alkyl iodide. The Marshall synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 1.3% with a longest linear sequence of 30 steps and 48 total steps.\n\n[[File:The Marshall synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|664px]]\n\n==== The Evans synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\n\nEvans and his co-workers<ref>Halstead, D. P. Ph.D. Thesis, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, 1999</ref>  has developed a strategy that relies heavily on [[asymmetric aldol]] methodology for the production of the polypropionate backbone. They used a Claisen condensation reaction to construct the C(13)\u2013C(14) trisubstituted Z-olefin. The Evans synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 6.4% with a longest linear sequence of 31 steps and 49 total steps.\n\n[[File:The Evans synthesis of (+)-discodermolide fragment.png|frameless|center|491px]]\n[[File:The Evans synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|499px]]\n\n==== The Smith gram-scale synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\n\nIn 1999, Smith and his co-workers<ref>Smith, A. B., III; Kaufman, M. D.; Beauchamp, T. J.; LaMarche, M. J.; Arimoto, H. Org. Lett. 1999, 1, 1823\u20131826</ref> reported the first gram-scale synthesis of (+)-discodermolide, which make the development of (+)-discodermolide as a potential [[chemotherapeutic]] agent possible. This synthetic route was licensed to [[Novartis Pharmaceuticals]]. One of the major improvements was that no purification was required in the first four steps of the five-step sequence towards the common precursor as the intermediate, aldol adduct, is a [[crystalline]] solid. A [[chelation]]-controlled Mukaiyama-[[aldol reaction]] was used to set the stereogenicity at C(5) of the [[lactone]] fragment.\n[[File:The Smith gram-scale synthesis of (+)-discodermolide fragment.png|frameless|center|550px]]\nTwo years later, Smith and his co-workers publish a third-generation synthesis in which the bulky TBS ether protecting group at C(11) of the [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] iodide was replaced by a less sterically encumbering group, MOM.  This modification favors the formation of the desired [[phosphonium]] salt. The Smith third-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 6.0% with a longest linear sequence of 21 steps and 35 total steps.\n[[File:The Smith gram-scale synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|675px]]\n\n==== The fourth-generation Smith synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\nThe key feature of the fourth-generation<ref>Smith, A. B., III; Freeze, B. S.; Xian, M.; Hirose, T. Org. Lett. 2005, 7, 1825\u20131828</ref> approach was the utilization of bidirectional fragment, vinyl iodide/phosphonium salt. [[phosphonium]] salt could be readily obtained as the trisubstituted [[vinyl group|vinyl]] iodide is less reactive than [[alkyl]] iodide. A Wittig reaction with followed by [[Suzuki coupling]] with alkyl iodide efficiently furnished the backbone of (+)-discodermolide. The Smith fourth-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 9.0% with a longest linear sequence of 17 steps and 36 total steps. \n[[File:The fourth-generation Smith synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|690px]]\n\n==== The first-generation Paterson synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\nPaterson and his co-workers<ref>Paterson, I.; Florence, G. J.; Gerlach, K.; Scott, J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2000, 39, 377\u2013380</ref> at the [[University of Cambridge]] have developed a strategy which utilizes novel [[chelation]]-controlled and reagent-controlled [[aldol reactions]] with high [[Stereoselectivity|selectivity]] for subunit connections. Another feature of this synthesis was the induction of C(8)-C(9) olefin with cis geometry via Still-Gennari [[Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction]]. The Paterson first-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 10.3% with a longest linear sequence of 23 steps and 42 total steps.\n[[File:The first-generation Paterson synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|744px]]\n\n==== The second- and third-generation Paterson syntheses of (+)-discodermolide====\nIn 2003, Paterson and co-workers<ref>Paterson, I.; Delgado, O.; Florence, G. J.; Lyothier, I.; Scott, J. P.; Sereinig, N. Org. Lett. 2003, 5, 35\u201338</ref>  reported a strategy that relies heavily on substrate-derived stereocontrol. Instead of a reagent-controlled aldol reaction in Paterson first-generation synthesis, a dicyclohexylboron-mediated anti-aldol was used to connect C(5)-C(6), which leads to a significant increase in [[diastereoselectivity]] from 4:1 to 92:8. Notably, Still\u2013Gennari modified [[Horner\u2013Wadsworth\u2013Emmons reaction]] was also used to construct the C(13)-C(14) trisubstituted [[olefin]] in early stage of this synthesis. The Paterson second-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 7.8% with a longest linear sequence of 24 steps and 35 total steps.\n[[File:The second-generation Paterson syntheses of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|650px]]\n\nIn 2004, Paterson and his co-workers<ref>Paterson, I.; Lyothier, I. Org. Lett. 2004, 6, 4933\u20134936</ref> disclosed the third-generation total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide. The stepwise method used in previous generations to incorporate the C(1)\u2013C(8) subunit was replaced by a late-stage Still-Gennari olefination, which leads to a notable improvement in [[convergence (chemistry)|convergence]]. The Paterson third-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 11.1% (highest reported to date) with a longest linear sequence of 21 steps and 37 total steps.\n[[File:The third-generation Paterson syntheses of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|589px]]\n\n==== The Novartis 60-g total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\nIn early 2004, [[Novartis Pharmaceuticals]]<ref>Mickel, S. J.; Niederer, D.; Daeffler, R.; Osmani, A.; Kuesters, E.; Schmid, E.; Schaer, K.; Gamboni, R.; Chen, W.; Loeser, E.; Kinder, F. R., Jr.; Konigsberger, K.; Prasad, K.; Ramsey, T. M.; Repic, O.; Wang, R.-M.; Florence, G.; Lyothier, I.; Paterson, I. Org. Process Res. Dev. 2004, 8, 122\u2013130</ref>  have disclosed the detail of a 60g-scale synthesis of (+)-discodermolide. This synthesis utilized the Smith gram-scale approach and the Paterson first-generation endgame. This synthesis allows (+)-discodermolide to be evaluated as an [[in vivo]] [[chemotherapeutic]] agent for adult [[patient]]s presenting with advanced solid [[malignancies]] in [[Phase I clinical trial]]s. The Novartis synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 0.65% with a longest linear sequence of 26 steps and 33 total steps.\n\n[[File:The Novartis 60-g total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|640px]]\n\n==== The Panek total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\nIn 2004, Panek and his co-workers<ref>Arefolov, A.; Panek, J. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 5596\u20135603</ref>  reported an approach which takes advantage of chiral [[crotylsilane]]-based C-C bond construction methodology to obtain the absolute stereochemistry of the three subunits of (+)-discodermolide. One of the key features of the Paterson approach is the utilization of [[hydrozirconation]]-cross-coupling methodology for the construction of C13-C14 (Z)-olefin. Acetate [[aldol reaction]] with high levels of 1,5-anti stereo induction and  [[palladium]]-mediated sp2-sp3 cross coupling reaction are used to connect subunits. The Panek synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 2.1% with a longest linear sequence of 27 steps and 42 total steps.\n\n[[File:The Panek total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|500px]]\n\n==== The Ardisson total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide====\nIn 2008, Ardisson and his co-workers<ref>de Lemos, Elsa; Poree, Francois-Hugues; Bourin, Arnaud; Barbion, Julien; Agouridas, Evangelos; Lannou, Marie-Isabelle; Commercon, Alain; Betzer, Jean-Francois; Pancrazi, Ange; Ardisson, Janick. Chemistry - A European Journal (2008), 14(35), 11092-11112</ref> reported a strategy that applies a [[crotyltitanation]] reaction repeatedly to yield homoallylic (Z)-O-ene-carbamate alcohols with excellent selectivity. This [[crotyltitanation]] reaction not only efficiently produces the syn-anti methyl-hydroxy-methyl triads of (+)-discodermolide, but also yields products that can be easily converted to terminal (Z)-[[diene]]. The C13-C14 (Z)-olefin is installed through a highly selective [[dyotropic]] rearrangement.  The Ardission synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 1.6% with a longest linear sequence of 21 steps. \n[[File:The Ardisson total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide endgame.png|frameless|center|620px]]\n\n==Clinical development==\nThe [[Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution]] licensed (+)-discodermolide to [[Novartis]], which began a phase 1 [[clinical trial]] in 2004.

The purpose of the test is to evaluate how likely the observed frequencies would be assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n\nTest statistics that follow a '''{{math|''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup>}}''' distribution occur when the observations are independent and normally distributed, which assumptions are often justified under the [[central limit theorem]]. \nThere are also '''{{math|''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup>}}''' tests for testing the null hypothesis of independence of a pair of random variables based on observations of the pairs.\n\nThe term \"chi-squared test\" is often used to refer to tests for which the distribution of the test statistic approaches the '''{{math|''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup>}}''' distribution ''asymptotically'', i.e.,  the sampling distribution (if the null hypothesis is true) of the test statistic approximates a chi-squared distribution more and more closely as sample sizes increase.\n\n== History ==\nIn the 19th century, statistical analytical methods were mainly applied in biological data analysis and it was customary for researchers to assume that observations followed a [[normal distribution]], such as [[Sir George Airy]] and [[Mansfield Merriman|Professor Merriman]], whose works were criticized by [[Karl Pearson]] in his 1900 paper.<ref name = Pearson1900>\n{{cite journal\n | last = Pearson | first = Karl\n | author-link = Karl Pearson\n | title = On the criterion that a given system of deviations from the probable in the case of a correlated system of variables is such that it can be reasonably supposed to have arisen from random sampling\n | journal = Philosophical Magazine |series=Series 5\n | volume = 50\n | issue = 302\n | year = 1900\n | pages = 157\u2013175\n | url = http://www.economics.soton.ac.uk/staff/aldrich/1900.pdf\n | doi = 10.1080/14786440009463897\n}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of 19th century, Pearson noticed the existence of significant [[skewness]] within some biological observations.

So we have the expected numbers {{math|''m<sub>i</sub>'' {{=}} ''np<sub>i</sub>''}} for all {{mvar|i}}, where\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n& \\sum^k_{i=1}{p_i} = 1 \\\\[8pt]\n& \\sum^k_{i=1}{m_i} = n\\sum^k_{i=1}{p_i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k}x_i\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nPearson proposed that, under the circumstance of the null hypothesis being correct, as {{math|''n'' \u2192 \u221e}} the limiting distribution of the quantity given below is the {{math|''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup>}} distribution.\n\n:<math>X^2=\\sum^k_{i=1}{\\frac{(x_i-m_i)^2}{m_i}}=\\sum^k_{i=1}{\\frac{x_i^2}{m_i}-n}</math>\n\nPearson dealt first with the case in which the expected numbers {{mvar|m<sub>i</sub>}} are large enough known numbers in all cells assuming every {{mvar|x<sub>i</sub>}} may be taken as [[normal distribution|normally distributed]], and reached the result that, in the limit as {{mvar|n}} becomes large, {{math|''X''{{isup|2}}}} follows the {{math|''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup>}} distribution with {{math|''k'' \u2212 1}} degrees of freedom.\n\nHowever, Pearson next considered the case in which the expected numbers depended on the parameters that had to be estimated from the sample, and suggested that, with the notation of {{mvar|m<sub>i</sub>}} being the true expected numbers and {{math|''m''\u2032<sub>''i''</sub>}} being the estimated expected numbers, the difference\n\n:<math>X^2-{X'}^2=\\sum^k_{i=1}{\\frac{x_i^2}{m_i}}-\\sum^k_{i=1}{\\frac{x_i^2}{m'_i}}</math>\n\nwill usually be positive and small enough to be omitted.

Such tests are uncommon in practice because the true variance of the population is usually unknown. However, there are several statistical tests where the [[chi-squared distribution]] is approximately valid:\n\n=== Fisher's exact test ===\nFor an exact test used in place of the 2 x 2 chi-squared test for independence, see [[Fisher's exact test]].\n\n=== Binomial test ===\nFor an exact test used in place of the 2 x 1 chi-squared test for goodness of fit, see [[Binomial test]].\n\n=== Other chi-squared tests ===\n* [[Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel statistics|Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel chi-squared test]].\n* [[McNemar's test]], used in certain {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} tables with pairing\n* [[Tukey's test of additivity]]\n* The [[portmanteau test]] in [[time-series analysis]], testing for the presence of [[autocorrelation]]\n* [[Likelihood-ratio test]]s in general [[statistical model]]ling, for testing whether there is evidence of the need to move from a simple model to a more complicated one (where the simple model is nested within the complicated one).\n\n== Yates's correction for continuity ==\n{{Main|Yates's correction for continuity}}\nUsing the [[chi-squared distribution]] to interpret [[Pearson's chi-squared test|Pearson's chi-squared statistic]] requires one to assume that the [[Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] probability of observed [[binomial distribution|binomial frequencies]] in the table can be approximated by the continuous [[chi-squared distribution]]. This assumption is not quite correct and introduces some error.\n\nTo reduce the error in approximation, [[Frank Yates]] suggested a correction for continuity that adjusts the formula for [[Pearson's chi-squared test]] by subtracting 0.5 from the absolute difference between each observed value and its expected value in a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} contingency table.<ref name=Yates>{{cite journal|authorlink=Frank Yates|last=Yates|first=Frank|date=1934|title=Contingency table involving small numbers and the {{math|''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup>}} test|journal=Supplement to the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society|volume=1|issue=2|pages=217\u2013235|jstor=2983604|doi=10.2307/2983604}}</ref> This reduces the chi-squared value obtained and thus increases its [[p-value|''p''-value]].\n\n==Chi-squared test for variance in a normal population==\nIf a sample of size {{math|''n''}} is taken from a population having a [[normal distribution]], then there is a result (see [[Variance#Distribution of the sample variance|distribution of the sample variance]]) which allows a test to be made of whether the variance of the population has a pre-determined value. For example, a manufacturing process might have been in stable condition for a long period, allowing a value for the variance to be determined essentially without error. Suppose that a variant of the process is being tested, giving rise to a small sample of {{math|''n''}} product items whose variation is to be tested. The test statistic {{math|''T''}} in this instance could be set to be the sum of squares about the sample mean, divided by the nominal value for the variance (i.e. the value to be tested as holding). Then {{math|''T''}} has a chi-squared distribution with {{math|''n'' \u2212 1}} [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]]. For example, if the sample size is 21, the acceptance region for {{math|''T''}} with a significance level of 5% is between 9.59 and 34.17.\n<!--\n==Chi-squared test for contingency table example==\n[[Dispute: This example is actually for a goodness-of-fit test, and NOT a test of independence in a contingency table]] [[Dispute claim is valid]]\n\nA chi-squared test may be applied on a [[contingency table]] for testing a null hypothesis of independence of rows and columns.\n\nAs an example of the use of the chi-squared test, a fair coin is one where heads and tails are equally likely to turn up after it is flipped. Suppose one is given a coin and asked to test if it is fair. After 200 trials, heads turn up 153 times and tails result 147 times. The following is a chi-squared analysis, where the null hypothesis is that the coin is fair:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|+ Chi-squared calculation of coin tosses\n| |\n| | Heads\n| Tails\n| Total\n|-\n| | Observed\n| | 53\n| | 47\n| | 100\n|-\n| | Expected\n| | 50\n| | 50\n| | 100\n|-\n| | {{math|(''O''  \u2212  ''E'')<sup>2</sup>}}\n| | 9\n| | 9\n| |\n|-\n| | {{math|1=''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup> = (''O'' \u2212 ''E'')<sup>2</sup>/''E''}}\n| | 0.18\n| | 0.18\n| | 0.36\n|}\nIn this case, the test has one [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degree of freedom]] and the chi-squared value is 0.36. In order to see whether this result is [[statistically significant]], the [[p-value]] (the probability that at least as extreme a result is observed when the null hypothesis is true) must be calculated or looked up in a chart. The p-value, {{math|Prob(''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup> \u2265 0.36)}}, is found to be 0.5485. There is thus a probability of about 55% of seeing data that deviates at least this much from the expected results if indeed the coin is fair. This probability is not considered statistically significant evidence of an unfair coin.-->\n\n==Example chi-squared test for categorical data==\n\nSuppose there is a city of 1,000,000 residents with four neighborhoods: {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, {{math|''C''}}, and {{math|''D''}}. A random sample of 650 residents of the city is taken and their occupation is recorded as [[Collar workers|\"white collar\", \"blue collar\", or \"no collar\"]]. The null hypothesis is that each person's neighborhood of residence is independent of the person's occupational classification.  The data are tabulated as:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|-\n!  !! {{math|''A''}} !! {{math|''B''}} !! {{math|''C''}} !! {{math|''D''}} !! total\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| White collar ||  90 || 60 || 104 || 95 || 349 \n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| Blue collar ||  30 ||  50 || 51 ||  20 || 151\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| No collar || 30 || 40 || 45 || 35 || 150\n|-\n!style=\"text-align: left;\"| Total || 150 || 150 || 200 || 150 || 650\n|}\n\nLet us take the sample living in neighborhood {{math|''A''}}, 150, to estimate what proportion of the whole 1,000,000 live in neighborhood {{math|''A''}}.  Similarly we take {{sfrac|349|650}} to estimate what proportion of the 1,000,000 are white-collar workers.  By the assumption of independence under the hypothesis we should \"expect\" the number of white-collar workers in neighborhood {{math|''A''}} to be\n\n: <math> 150\\times\\frac{349}{650} \\approx 80.54 </math>\n\nThen in that \"cell\" of the table, we have\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\left(\\text{observed}-\\text{expected}\\right)^2}{\\text{expected}} = \\frac{\\left(90-80.54\\right)^2}{80.54} \\approx 1.11</math>\n\nThe sum of these quantities over all of the cells is the test statistic; in this case, <math> \\approx 24.6 </math>.  Under the null hypothesis, this sum has approximately a chi-squared distribution whose number of degrees of freedom are\n\n: <math> (\\text{number of rows}-1)(\\text{number of columns}-1) = (3-1)(4-1) = 6 </math>\n\nIf the test statistic is improbably large according to that chi-squared distribution, then one rejects the null hypothesis of '''independence'''.\n\nA related issue is a test of '''homogeneity'''.  Suppose that instead of giving every resident of each of the four neighborhoods an equal chance of inclusion in the sample, we decide in advance how many residents of each neighborhood to include.  Then each resident has the same chance of being chosen as do all residents of the same neighborhood, but residents of different neighborhoods would have different probabilities of being chosen if the four sample sizes are not proportional to the populations of the four neighborhoods.  In such a case, we would be testing \"homogeneity\" rather than \"independence\".  The question is whether the proportions of blue-collar, white-collar, and no-collar workers in the four neighborhoods are the same.  However, the test is done in the same way.\n\n==Applications==\n\nIn [[cryptanalysis]], the chi-squared test is used to compare the distribution of [[plaintext]] and (possibly) decrypted [[ciphertext]].

So we have the expected numbers {{math|''m<sub>i</sub>'' {{=}} ''np<sub>i</sub>''}} for all {{mvar|i}}, where\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n& \\sum^k_{i=1}{p_i} = 1 \\\\[8pt]\n& \\sum^k_{i=1}{m_i} = n\\sum^k_{i=1}{p_i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k}x_i\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nPearson proposed that, under the circumstance of the null hypothesis being correct, as {{math|''n'' \u2192 \u221e}} the limiting distribution of the quantity given below is the {{math|''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup>}} distribution.\n\n:<math>X^2=\\sum^k_{i=1}{\\frac{(x_i-m_i)^2}{m_i}}=\\sum^k_{i=1}{\\frac{x_i^2}{m_i}-n}</math>\n\nPearson dealt first with the case in which the expected numbers {{mvar|m<sub>i</sub>}} are large enough known numbers in all cells assuming every {{mvar|x<sub>i</sub>}} may be taken as [[normal distribution|normally distributed]], and reached the result that, in the limit as {{mvar|n}} becomes large, {{math|''X''{{isup|2}}}} follows the {{math|''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup>}} distribution with {{math|''k'' \u2212 1}} degrees of freedom.\n\nHowever, Pearson next considered the case in which the expected numbers depended on the parameters that had to be estimated from the sample, and suggested that, with the notation of {{mvar|m<sub>i</sub>}} being the true expected numbers and {{math|''m''\u2032<sub>''i''</sub>}} being the estimated expected numbers, the difference\n\n:<math>X^2-{X'}^2=\\sum^k_{i=1}{\\frac{x_i^2}{m_i}}-\\sum^k_{i=1}{\\frac{x_i^2}{m'_i}}</math>\n\nwill usually be positive and small enough to be omitted. In a conclusion, Pearson argued that if we regarded {{math|''X''\u2032{{isup|2}}}} as also distributed as {{math|''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup>}} distribution with {{math|''k'' \u2212 1}} degrees of freedom, the error in this approximation would not affect practical decisions.

Such tests are uncommon in practice because the true variance of the population is usually unknown. However, there are several statistical tests where the [[chi-squared distribution]] is approximately valid:\n\n=== Fisher's exact test ===\nFor an exact test used in place of the 2 x 2 chi-squared test for independence, see [[Fisher's exact test]].\n\n=== Binomial test ===\nFor an exact test used in place of the 2 x 1 chi-squared test for goodness of fit, see [[Binomial test]].\n\n=== Other chi-squared tests ===\n* [[Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel statistics|Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel chi-squared test]].\n* [[McNemar's test]], used in certain {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} tables with pairing\n* [[Tukey's test of additivity]]\n* The [[portmanteau test]] in [[time-series analysis]], testing for the presence of [[autocorrelation]]\n* [[Likelihood-ratio test]]s in general [[statistical model]]ling, for testing whether there is evidence of the need to move from a simple model to a more complicated one (where the simple model is nested within the complicated one).\n\n== Yates's correction for continuity ==\n{{Main|Yates's correction for continuity}}\nUsing the [[chi-squared distribution]] to interpret [[Pearson's chi-squared test|Pearson's chi-squared statistic]] requires one to assume that the [[Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] probability of observed [[binomial distribution|binomial frequencies]] in the table can be approximated by the continuous [[chi-squared distribution]]. This assumption is not quite correct and introduces some error.\n\nTo reduce the error in approximation, [[Frank Yates]] suggested a correction for continuity that adjusts the formula for [[Pearson's chi-squared test]] by subtracting 0.5 from the absolute difference between each observed value and its expected value in a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} contingency table.<ref name=Yates>{{cite journal|authorlink=Frank Yates|last=Yates|first=Frank|date=1934|title=Contingency table involving small numbers and the {{math|''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup>}} test|journal=Supplement to the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society|volume=1|issue=2|pages=217\u2013235|jstor=2983604|doi=10.2307/2983604}}</ref> This reduces the chi-squared value obtained and thus increases its [[p-value|''p''-value]].\n\n==Chi-squared test for variance in a normal population==\nIf a sample of size {{math|''n''}} is taken from a population having a [[normal distribution]], then there is a result (see [[Variance#Distribution of the sample variance|distribution of the sample variance]]) which allows a test to be made of whether the variance of the population has a pre-determined value. For example, a manufacturing process might have been in stable condition for a long period, allowing a value for the variance to be determined essentially without error. Suppose that a variant of the process is being tested, giving rise to a small sample of {{math|''n''}} product items whose variation is to be tested. The test statistic {{math|''T''}} in this instance could be set to be the sum of squares about the sample mean, divided by the nominal value for the variance (i.e. the value to be tested as holding). Then {{math|''T''}} has a chi-squared distribution with {{math|''n'' \u2212 1}} [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]]. For example, if the sample size is 21, the acceptance region for {{math|''T''}} with a significance level of 5% is between 9.59 and 34.17.\n<!--\n==Chi-squared test for contingency table example==\n[[Dispute: This example is actually for a goodness-of-fit test, and NOT a test of independence in a contingency table]] [[Dispute claim is valid]]\n\nA chi-squared test may be applied on a [[contingency table]] for testing a null hypothesis of independence of rows and columns.\n\nAs an example of the use of the chi-squared test, a fair coin is one where heads and tails are equally likely to turn up after it is flipped. Suppose one is given a coin and asked to test if it is fair. After 200 trials, heads turn up 153 times and tails result 147 times. The following is a chi-squared analysis, where the null hypothesis is that the coin is fair:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|+ Chi-squared calculation of coin tosses\n| |\n| | Heads\n| Tails\n| Total\n|-\n| | Observed\n| | 53\n| | 47\n| | 100\n|-\n| | Expected\n| | 50\n| | 50\n| | 100\n|-\n| | {{math|(''O''  \u2212  ''E'')<sup>2</sup>}}\n| | 9\n| | 9\n| |\n|-\n| | {{math|1=''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup> = (''O'' \u2212 ''E'')<sup>2</sup>/''E''}}\n| | 0.18\n| | 0.18\n| | 0.36\n|}\nIn this case, the test has one [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degree of freedom]] and the chi-squared value is 0.36. In order to see whether this result is [[statistically significant]], the [[p-value]] (the probability that at least as extreme a result is observed when the null hypothesis is true) must be calculated or looked up in a chart. The p-value, {{math|Prob(''\u03c7''<sup>2</sup> \u2265 0.36)}}, is found to be 0.5485. There is thus a probability of about 55% of seeing data that deviates at least this much from the expected results if indeed the coin is fair. This probability is not considered statistically significant evidence of an unfair coin.-->\n\n==Example chi-squared test for categorical data==\n\nSuppose there is a city of 1,000,000 residents with four neighborhoods: {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, {{math|''C''}}, and {{math|''D''}}. A random sample of 650 residents of the city is taken and their occupation is recorded as [[Collar workers|\"white collar\", \"blue collar\", or \"no collar\"]]. The null hypothesis is that each person's neighborhood of residence is independent of the person's occupational classification.  The data are tabulated as:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|-\n!  !! {{math|''A''}} !! {{math|''B''}} !! {{math|''C''}} !! {{math|''D''}} !! total\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| White collar ||  90 || 60 || 104 || 95 || 349 \n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| Blue collar ||  30 ||  50 || 51 ||  20 || 151\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| No collar || 30 || 40 || 45 || 35 || 150\n|-\n!style=\"text-align: left;\"| Total || 150 || 150 || 200 || 150 || 650\n|}\n\nLet us take the sample living in neighborhood {{math|''A''}}, 150, to estimate what proportion of the whole 1,000,000 live in neighborhood {{math|''A''}}.  Similarly we take {{sfrac|349|650}} to estimate what proportion of the 1,000,000 are white-collar workers.  By the assumption of independence under the hypothesis we should \"expect\" the number of white-collar workers in neighborhood {{math|''A''}} to be\n\n: <math> 150\\times\\frac{349}{650} \\approx 80.54 </math>\n\nThen in that \"cell\" of the table, we have\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\left(\\text{observed}-\\text{expected}\\right)^2}{\\text{expected}} = \\frac{\\left(90-80.54\\right)^2}{80.54} \\approx 1.11</math>\n\nThe sum of these quantities over all of the cells is the test statistic; in this case, <math> \\approx 24.6 </math>.  Under the null hypothesis, this sum has approximately a chi-squared distribution whose number of degrees of freedom are\n\n: <math> (\\text{number of rows}-1)(\\text{number of columns}-1) = (3-1)(4-1) = 6 </math>\n\nIf the test statistic is improbably large according to that chi-squared distribution, then one rejects the null hypothesis of '''independence'''.\n\nA related issue is a test of '''homogeneity'''.  Suppose that instead of giving every resident of each of the four neighborhoods an equal chance of inclusion in the sample, we decide in advance how many residents of each neighborhood to include.  Then each resident has the same chance of being chosen as do all residents of the same neighborhood, but residents of different neighborhoods would have different probabilities of being chosen if the four sample sizes are not proportional to the populations of the four neighborhoods.  In such a case, we would be testing \"homogeneity\" rather than \"independence\".  The question is whether the proportions of blue-collar, white-collar, and no-collar workers in the four neighborhoods are the same.  However, the test is done in the same way.\n\n==Applications==\n\nIn [[cryptanalysis]], the chi-squared test is used to compare the distribution of [[plaintext]] and (possibly) decrypted [[ciphertext]]. The lowest value of the test means that the decryption was successful with high probability.<ref name=practicalcrypto>{{cite web|title=Chi-squared Statistic|url=http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/text-characterisation/chi-squared-statistic/|website=Practical Cryptography|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=ibmath>{{cite web|title=Using Chi Squared to Crack Codes|url=http://ibmathsresources.com/2014/06/15/using-chi-squared-to-crack-codes/|website=IB Maths Resources|publisher=British International School Phuket}}</ref> This method can be generalized for solving modern cryptographic problems.<ref name=elsevier>{{cite journal|last1=Ryabko|first1=B.

It was occupied from July 1942 to early 1946 in Lamar County, [[Texas]]. Its main entrance was located nine miles north of Paris, Texas. Planning for the 70,000-acre military post began in 1940, soon after the National Military Draft was ordered; the planning accelerated in 1941 shortly before the United States entered World War II in December 1941.\n\nOn 1 May 1941, an engineering contract to design a $22,800,000 military camp in northwest Lamar County was awarded to a Dallas firm. On 20 January 1942, Congressman Patman announced that groundbreaking for the camp was imminent.  Construction of the camp started on 27 February 1942, and on 2 April 1942, the Army issued General Orders No. 17, which included the name of the military reservation. The facility near Paris, Texas was named Camp Maxey in honor of Confederate [[Samuel Bell Maxey]]. The first US Army personnel to manage the new reservation arrived on 4 July 1942. The post was activated by the US Army on 15 July 1942, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Callie H. Palmer.\n\n== Troops arriving ==\nThe first division to be trained at the camp was the [[102nd Infantry Division (United States)|102d Infantry Division]]. Cadre personnel of the 102nd Infantry arrived at Camp Maxey on 1 September 1942 and was formally activated on 15 September 1942, under Major General [[John B. Anderson (general)|John B. Anderson]]. The 102nd Infantry Division before the war was a National Guard infantry unit from Missouri and Kansas that formed in 1921 and was nicknamed the \"Ozark Division\". Nationwide military enlistment greatly expanded throughout 1942 in response to US troops departing for combat action in the Pacific and European theaters. Young men from throughout the United States filled the 102nd Infantry Division's ranked and arrived for training at Camp Maxey. Trainloads of draftees began arriving and the division began to grow to its authorized strength of 40,000.\n\nThe field training of the draftees consisted of a variety of infantry exercises spread over the reservation's 70,000 acres. The varied terrain provided facilities for working out problems of infantry training to meet modern battle conditions. An artillery range, obstacle course, infiltration course, and \"German Village\" were included in training maneuvers. In an era before electronic targets, camp designers used an ingenious arrangement of ropes and pulleys to pop silhouette targets up in windows and doorways to add authenticity and realism to the village training area. The camp's obstacle course used challenging barbed wire barriers and small dynamite charges to simulate artillery explosions.\n\nIn March 1943, command of Camp Maxey administration was passed to Colonel Robert O. Annin, who remained there for the duration of the war. In late 1943, the 102nd Division departed after one year at Camp Maxey, moving to Louisiana for maneuvers before being sent into action in France shortly after the Normandy Invasion. Major General Anderson remained at Camp Maxey to command Tenth Corps Headquarters.\n\nIn November 1943, the [[99th Infantry Division (United States)|99th Infantry Division]], nicknamed the \"Checkerboard Division\", arrived at Camp Maxey under the command of Major General [[Walter E. Lauer]].  The 99th Infantry Division trained at Camp Maxey until September 1944 and was sent into action in the European Theatre.\n\nIn addition to training the 102nd Infantry and 99th Infantry, Camp Maxey hosted other military units from 1942 through 1945, including the following: 9th Headquarters, 3rd (later 4th) Army Special Troops, Army Service Forces Replacement Training Center (ROTC students from a five-state area), Tenth Corps Headquarters, 1882nd (local administration for the Eighth Service Command), Regional Hospital and Reconditioning Annex, Infantry Advance Replacement Training Center (15 week Basic training for replacement troops to existing divisions after October 1944), and Regional Troops Separation Point (at the end of the war after 15 September 1945). Other non-divisional units trained at Camp Maxey including artillery (250th Field Artillery who fired the one millionth round of World War II on 29 January 1945), and associated reconnaissance aircraft, tanks, tank destroyers, cavalry, ordinance, quartermaster, signal corps, engineers, medics, and military police (793rd Military Police Battalion was activated at Camp Maxey on 26 December 1942. The battalion stayed at Camp Maxey until February 1944, when they departed for Scotland to train for the invasion of France).\n\n== Camp Maxey as a prisoner of war (POW) camp ==\nCamp Maxey was a prisoner of war camp from October 1943 to February 1946. The POW area consisted of [[barracks]] and recreation halls inside a large fenced stockade with watchtowers. It was located at the extreme southeast corner of the reservation along the railroad and highway. It was ordered to be constructed in 1942 and projected to hold captives from the Pacific theatre. Triumph for the Allies in North Africa in the spring of 1943, and the realization that the Japanese would not surrender in large numbers, resulted in the internment of principally German troops from the defeated [[Afrika Korps]]. Later in the war, more non-commissioned officers arrived from the German army, navy, and air force until the camp grew to 7,458 prisoners by April 1945, but stopped short of its capacity of 9,000. The last German prisoners of war left Camp Maxey in the spring of 1946.\n\n== The closure of Camp Maxey ==\nWith the European war over in May 1945, and the Pacific war abruptly ending in August 1945, the principal training assignment of Camp Maxey was finished. Camp Maxey was placed on the \"inactive list\" on 1 October 1945, with the Regional Hospital to close 1 November.  The POW Camp, Separation Point, and station complement would remain open but its population slowly dwindled. The final issue of the camp newspaper Maxey Times on 12 October 1945 highlighted the camp's history, noted the rapidly shrinking populations of its personnel, and featured a farewell message from the Camp Commander COL Annin.\n\nThe camp sat empty, but intact, for several years after the war. During the 1950s, the federal government began the final process of dismantling the Camp Maxey [[cantonment]] and selling off the land. More than 1,000 buildings were sold for demolition, and some were moved for relocation as public facilities. Several thousand acres were kept intact by the federal government, including the old post command buildings and vehicle shops near Gate 5 (current National Guard Camp Maxey Training Center Headquarters\u2019 and cantonment area), and turned over to the Texas National Guard for a training facility. In the early 1960s some 10,000 acres of the old artillery range on the north side of the former camp along Sanders Creek, conveniently without improvements or public access for the past 20 years, were transferred to the US Army Corps of Engineers for construction of Pat Mayes Reservoir. This reduced the size of Camp Maxey to approximately 6,650 acres.\n\n== The National Guard era ==\nPresently, the installation serves as a training center for the Texas National Guard.

This area involves various types of units, i.e. Infantry, Engineer and other support units. Some upgrades have been completed over the last decade to include upgraded ranges and troop housing facilities, which occurred during the [[War on Terror]] era.\n\nPost World War II, TXARNG Commanders of Camp Maxey: LTC Wisely: UKN, MAJ Smith: UKN, MAJ Todd Lehenbauer: 2007\u20132013, MAJ Mike Ford: 2014, CPT David Merrill II: 2015 \u2013 present\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Texas Military Forces]]\n* [[Texas Military Department]]\n* [[List of conflicts involving the Texas Military]]\n* [[Awards and decorations of the Texas Military]]\n\n*[[List of World War II prisoner-of-war camps in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*1943 News from Camp Maxey\n**[https://web.archive.org/web/20080509082919/http://www.war-letters.com/0004/0006.html August 7th]\n**[https://archive.today/20130209004246/http://www.war-letters.com/0004/0011.html August 21st] \n*[http://www.jfgvictoryverlag.com/battlebabies/maxey.html Information on the 99th Infantry Division]\n*[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/camp-maxey.htm Globalsecurity.org - about the camp]\n\n{{coord|33|46|53|N|95|32|39|W|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Lamar County, Texas]]\n[[Category:Installations of the United States Army National Guard]]\n[[Category:Military facilities in Texas]]\n[[Category:Texas Military Department]]\n[[Category:Texas Military Forces]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date=October 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=May 2017}}\n\n'''Camp Maxey''' was a [[World War II]] infantry-training camp and associated facilities. It was occupied from July 1942 to early 1946 in Lamar County, [[Texas]]. Its main entrance was located nine miles north of Paris, Texas. Planning for the 70,000-acre military post began in 1940, soon after the National Military Draft was ordered; the planning accelerated in 1941 shortly before the United States entered World War II in December 1941.\n\nOn 1 May 1941, an engineering contract to design a $22,800,000 military camp in northwest Lamar County was awarded to a Dallas firm. On 20 January 1942, Congressman Patman announced that groundbreaking for the camp was imminent.  Construction of the camp started on 27 February 1942, and on 2 April 1942, the Army issued General Orders No. 17, which included the name of the military reservation. The facility near Paris, Texas was named Camp Maxey in honor of Confederate [[Samuel Bell Maxey]]. The first US Army personnel to manage the new reservation arrived on 4 July 1942. The post was activated by the US Army on 15 July 1942, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Callie H. Palmer.\n\n== Troops arriving ==\nThe first division to be trained at the camp was the [[102nd Infantry Division (United States)|102d Infantry Division]]. Cadre personnel of the 102nd Infantry arrived at Camp Maxey on 1 September 1942 and was formally activated on 15 September 1942, under Major General [[John B. Anderson (general)|John B. Anderson]]. The 102nd Infantry Division before the war was a National Guard infantry unit from Missouri and Kansas that formed in 1921 and was nicknamed the \"Ozark Division\". Nationwide military enlistment greatly expanded throughout 1942 in response to US troops departing for combat action in the Pacific and European theaters. Young men from throughout the United States filled the 102nd Infantry Division\u2019s ranked and arrived for training at Camp Maxey. Trainloads of draftees began arriving and the division began to grow to its authorized strength of 40,000.\n\nThe field training of the draftees consisted of a variety of infantry exercises spread over the reservation\u2019s 70,000 acres. The varied terrain provided facilities for working out problems of infantry training to meet modern battle conditions. An artillery range, obstacle course, infiltration course, and \"German Village\" were included in training maneuvers. In an era before electronic targets, camp designers used an ingenious arrangement of ropes and pulleys to pop silhouette targets up in windows and doorways to add authenticity and realism to the village training area. The camp\u2019s obstacle course used challenging barbed wire barriers and small dynamite charges to simulate artillery explosions.\n\nIn March 1943, command of Camp Maxey administration was passed to Colonel Robert O. Annin, who remained there for the duration of the war. In late 1943, the 102nd Division departed after one year at Camp Maxey, moving to Louisiana for maneuvers before being sent into action in France shortly after the Normandy Invasion. Major General Anderson remained at Camp Maxey to command Tenth Corps Headquarters.\n\nIn November 1943, the [[99th Infantry Division (United States)|99th Infantry Division]], nicknamed the \"Checkerboard Division\", arrived at Camp Maxey under the command of Major General [[Walter E. Lauer]].  The 99th Infantry Division trained at Camp Maxey until September 1944 and was sent into action in the European Theatre.\n\nIn addition to training the 102nd Infantry and 99th Infantry, Camp Maxey hosted other military units from 1942 through 1945, including the following: 9th Headquarters, 3rd (later 4th) Army Special Troops, Army Service Forces Replacement Training Center (ROTC students from a five-state area), Tenth Corps Headquarters, 1882nd (local administration for the Eighth Service Command), Regional Hospital and Reconditioning Annex, Infantry Advance Replacement Training Center (15 week Basic training for replacement troops to existing divisions after October 1944), and Regional Troops Separation Point (at the end of the war after 15 September 1945). Other non-divisional units trained at Camp Maxey including artillery (250th Field Artillery who fired the one millionth round of World War II on 29 January 1945), and associated reconnaissance aircraft, tanks, tank destroyers, cavalry, ordinance, quartermaster, signal corps, engineers, medics, and military police (793rd Military Police Battalion was activated at Camp Maxey on 26 December 1942. The battalion stayed at Camp Maxey until February 1944, when they departed for Scotland to train for the invasion of France).\n\n== Camp Maxey as a prisoner of war (POW) camp ==\nCamp Maxey was a prisoner of war camp from October 1943 to February 1946. The POW area consisted of [[barracks]] and recreation halls inside a large fenced stockade with watchtowers. It was located at the extreme southeast corner of the reservation along the railroad and highway. It was ordered to be constructed in 1942 and projected to hold captives from the Pacific theatre. Triumph for the Allies in North Africa in the spring of 1943, and the realization that the Japanese would not surrender in large numbers, resulted in the internment of principally German troops from the defeated [[Afrika Korps]]. Later in the war, more non-commissioned officers arrived from the German army, navy, and air force until the camp grew to 7,458 prisoners by April 1945, but stopped short of its capacity of 9,000.

She was known in [[Latin]] as ''Mathildis Imperatrix'' and in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] as ''Imperatrice Mahaut''.|group=\"nb\"}} was one of the claimants to the English throne during the civil war known as [[the Anarchy]]. The daughter of [[King Henry I of England]], she moved to Germany as a child when she married the future [[Holy Roman Emperor Henry V]]. She travelled with her husband into Italy in 1116, was controversially crowned in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]], and acted as the imperial [[regent]] in Italy. Matilda and Henry V had no children, and when he died in 1125, the imperial crown was claimed by his rival [[Lothair of Supplinburg]].\n\nMeanwhile, Matilda's younger brother, [[William Adelin]], died in the ''[[White Ship]]'' disaster of 1120, leaving Matilda's father and England facing a potential succession crisis. On Emperor Henry V's death, Matilda was recalled to [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] by her father, who arranged for her to marry [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] to form an alliance to protect his southern borders. Henry I had no further legitimate children and nominated Matilda as his heir, making his court swear an [[oath]] of loyalty to her and her successors, but the decision was not popular in the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] court. Henry died in 1135, but Matilda and Geoffrey faced opposition from Anglo-Norman barons. The throne was instead taken by Matilda's cousin [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]], who enjoyed the backing of the [[Christianity in England|English Church]]. Stephen took steps to solidify his new regime but faced threats both from neighbouring powers and from opponents within his kingdom.\n\nIn 1139, Matilda crossed to England to take the kingdom by force, supported by her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]] and her uncle [[King David I of Scotland]], while Geoffrey focused on conquering Normandy. Matilda's forces captured Stephen at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|Battle of Lincoln]] in 1141, but the Empress' attempt to be crowned at [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] collapsed in the face of bitter opposition from the London crowds. As a result of this retreat, Matilda was never formally declared Queen of England, and was instead titled the Lady of the English. Robert was captured following the [[Rout of Winchester]] in 1141, and Matilda agreed to exchange him for Stephen. Matilda became trapped in [[Oxford Castle]] by Stephen's forces that winter, and was forced to escape across the frozen [[River Isis]] at night to avoid capture. The war degenerated into a stalemate, with Matilda controlling much of the south-west of England, and Stephen the south-east and the Midlands. Large parts of the rest of the country were in the hands of local, independent barons.\n\nMatilda returned to Normandy, now in the hands of her husband, in 1148, leaving her eldest son to continue the campaign in England; he eventually succeeded to the throne as [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1154, forming the [[Angevin Empire]]. She settled her court near [[Rouen]] and for the rest of her life concerned herself with the administration of Normandy, acting on her son's behalf when necessary. Particularly in the early years of her son's reign, she provided political advice and attempted to mediate during the [[Becket controversy]]. She worked extensively with the Church, founding [[Cistercian]] monasteries, and was known for her piety. She was buried under the high altar at [[Bec Abbey]] after her death in 1167.\n\n==Childhood==\nMatilda was born to [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], King of England and [[Duke of Normandy]], and his first wife, [[Matilda of Scotland]], possibly around 7 February 1102 at [[Sutton Courtenay]], in Berkshire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>{{refn|Matilda's date of birth was not recorded at the time and can only be estimated by later chronicler statements about her age. Older histories suggested that Matilda of Scotland gave birth to a child in the city of Winchester in July 1101. These were based on the writings of the chronicler [[Wace]]; current scholarship, based on the records of the Queen's travels, considers this account to have been impossible, and places Matilda of Scotland at Sutton Courtenay in early February 1102, where the Empress Matilda was probably born.<ref name=\"Chibnall 1991 9\">{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=9}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}} Henry was the youngest son of [[William the Conqueror]], who had invaded England in 1066, creating an empire stretching into Wales.

She was known in [[Latin]] as ''Mathildis Imperatrix'' and in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] as ''Imperatrice Mahaut''.|group=\"nb\"}} was one of the claimants to the English throne during the civil war known as [[the Anarchy]]. The daughter of [[King Henry I of England]], she moved to Germany as a child when she married the future [[Holy Roman Emperor Henry V]]. She travelled with her husband into Italy in 1116, was controversially crowned in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]], and acted as the imperial [[regent]] in Italy. Matilda and Henry V had no children, and when he died in 1125, the imperial crown was claimed by his rival [[Lothair of Supplinburg]].\n\nMeanwhile, Matilda's younger brother, [[William Adelin]], died in the ''[[White Ship]]'' disaster of 1120, leaving Matilda's father and England facing a potential succession crisis. On Emperor Henry V's death, Matilda was recalled to [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] by her father, who arranged for her to marry [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] to form an alliance to protect his southern borders. Henry I had no further legitimate children and nominated Matilda as his heir, making his court swear an [[oath]] of loyalty to her and her successors, but the decision was not popular in the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] court. Henry died in 1135, but Matilda and Geoffrey faced opposition from Anglo-Norman barons. The throne was instead taken by Matilda's cousin [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]], who enjoyed the backing of the [[Christianity in England|English Church]]. Stephen took steps to solidify his new regime but faced threats both from neighbouring powers and from opponents within his kingdom.\n\nIn 1139, Matilda crossed to England to take the kingdom by force, supported by her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]] and her uncle [[King David I of Scotland]], while Geoffrey focused on conquering Normandy. Matilda's forces captured Stephen at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|Battle of Lincoln]] in 1141, but the Empress' attempt to be crowned at [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] collapsed in the face of bitter opposition from the London crowds. As a result of this retreat, Matilda was never formally declared Queen of England, and was instead titled the Lady of the English. Robert was captured following the [[Rout of Winchester]] in 1141, and Matilda agreed to exchange him for Stephen. Matilda became trapped in [[Oxford Castle]] by Stephen's forces that winter, and was forced to escape across the frozen [[River Isis]] at night to avoid capture. The war degenerated into a stalemate, with Matilda controlling much of the south-west of England, and Stephen the south-east and the Midlands. Large parts of the rest of the country were in the hands of local, independent barons.\n\nMatilda returned to Normandy, now in the hands of her husband, in 1148, leaving her eldest son to continue the campaign in England; he eventually succeeded to the throne as [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1154, forming the [[Angevin Empire]]. She settled her court near [[Rouen]] and for the rest of her life concerned herself with the administration of Normandy, acting on her son's behalf when necessary. Particularly in the early years of her son's reign, she provided political advice and attempted to mediate during the [[Becket controversy]]. She worked extensively with the Church, founding [[Cistercian]] monasteries, and was known for her piety. She was buried under the high altar at [[Bec Abbey]] after her death in 1167.\n\n==Childhood==\nMatilda was born to [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], King of England and [[Duke of Normandy]], and his first wife, [[Matilda of Scotland]], possibly around 7 February 1102 at [[Sutton Courtenay]], in Berkshire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>{{refn|Matilda's date of birth was not recorded at the time and can only be estimated by later chronicler statements about her age. Older histories suggested that Matilda of Scotland gave birth to a child in the city of Winchester in July 1101. These were based on the writings of the chronicler [[Wace]]; current scholarship, based on the records of the Queen's travels, considers this account to have been impossible, and places Matilda of Scotland at Sutton Courtenay in early February 1102, where the Empress Matilda was probably born.<ref name=\"Chibnall 1991 9\">{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=9}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}} Henry was the youngest son of [[William the Conqueror]], who had invaded England in 1066, creating an empire stretching into Wales.
