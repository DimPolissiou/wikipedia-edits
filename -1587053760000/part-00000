Even as a young child he was fascinated by music and writing, both of which became lifelong passions. He attended local schools but dropped out in 1966 to pursue dreams of rock and roll stardom.\n\n==Columbia records==\nJim played with several local bands from 1963 to 1966, before helping form [[The Bluesmen Revue]], originally Sally and the Bluesmen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/B/Bluesmen_Revue.html |title=Canoe's Page on The Bluesmen Revue |publisher=Jam.canoe.ca |date=November 28, 2004 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref> They quickly became the top-grossing and most popular band in Southern Ontario, touring throughout the area and into the U.S.<ref>''The London Free Press'' April 26, 1966.

A falling out with their U.S. management company and dissatisfaction with the label's plans for them spelled the end of their Columbia contract, and, dispirited by their failure to crack the big time, the band split up in early 1969.\n\n==Working musician==\nAfter a year-long hiatus from music, Jim joined popular Canadian showband Leather and Lace for several months, leaving shortly before they changed their name to [[Ocean (band)|Ocean]] and had an international hit with [[Put Your Hand in the Hand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1591185 |title=Ocean Put Your Hand in the Hand CD Canada |publisher=Cduniverse.com |date=July 26, 2005 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref> He then formed his own band, Bad Axe, with John Hotson, George Attrill, James Drynan and Bert Hamer.<ref>''Scene'' October 7\u201320, 1999.

Among their clients were Garwood \"Twitch\" Wallace, Homespun, North, Busker, Rick McGhie, and Easy, all of whom enjoyed success as touring acts. With support from financier Lou Saddy and recording engineer Bob Leth, and hospitality on site studio manager, Beverley Barnett Leth (now Graham) they opened [[Springfield Sound]] in a former country schoolhouse near Aylmer, Ontario.

Jim took over the duties of Marketing and Promotions Manager for the team in the early 1990s.<ref name=\"autogenerated1993\"/>\n\n==The Morning Show Musical Maestro==\nIn 1988 Chapman was contracted to write novelty songs for Peter Garland's top-rated morning show on CFPL 980 Radio, reaching an audience across southern Ontario.

He attended local schools but dropped out in 1966 to pursue dreams of rock and roll stardom.\n\n==Columbia records==\nJim played with several local bands from 1963 to 1966, before helping form [[The Bluesmen Revue]], originally Sally and the Bluesmen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/B/Bluesmen_Revue.html |title=Canoe's Page on The Bluesmen Revue |publisher=Jam.canoe.ca |date=November 28, 2004 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref> They quickly became the top-grossing and most popular band in Southern Ontario, touring throughout the area and into the U.S.<ref>''The London Free Press'' April 26, 1966.

A falling out with their U.S. management company and dissatisfaction with the label's plans for them spelled the end of their Columbia contract, and, dispirited by their failure to crack the big time, the band split up in early 1969.\n\n==Working musician==\nAfter a year-long hiatus from music, Jim joined popular Canadian showband Leather and Lace for several months, leaving shortly before they changed their name to [[Ocean (band)|Ocean]] and had an international hit with [[Put Your Hand in the Hand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1591185 |title=Ocean Put Your Hand in the Hand CD Canada |publisher=Cduniverse.com |date=July 26, 2005 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref> He then formed his own band, Bad Axe, with John Hotson, George Attrill, James Drynan and Bert Hamer.<ref>''Scene'' October 7\u201320, 1999.

Among their clients were Garwood \"Twitch\" Wallace, Homespun, North, Busker, Rick McGhie, and Easy, all of whom enjoyed success as touring acts. With support from financier Lou Saddy and recording engineer Bob Leth, and hospitality on site studio manager, Beverley Barnett Leth (now Graham) they opened [[Springfield Sound]] in a former country schoolhouse near Aylmer, Ontario.

In fact, while king Carlos died instantly under the bullets of the anarchists on 1 February 1908, his son Lu\u00eds Filipe, the crown prince, survived for a few hours, enough to allow governmental officials to name him king. This act is, however, usually considered as historically irrelevant, given that the crown prince never recovered from his coma.
