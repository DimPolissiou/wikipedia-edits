The mountains at the north end of the lake are part of the [[Fremont National Forest]], and the south end of the lake is adjacent to [[Modoc National Forest]] lands.

Later, it was renamed ''Avan Vardgesi'' (\u0531\u0582\u0561\u0576 \u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u056b, \"Town of Vardges\") or ''Vardgesavan'' (\u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u0561\u0582\u0561\u0576) by Prince Vardges Manouk who rebuilt the settlement near the shores of [[Kasagh River]], during the reign of King [[Orontes I Sakavakyats]] of Armenia (570\u2013560 BC). However, in his first book, ''Wars of Justinian'', the Byzantine historian [[Procopius]] refers to the city as ''Valashabad'' (Balashabad), named after King Valash (Balash) of Armenia. The name evolved into its later form by the shift of the medial ''l'' into a ''gh'', which is common in the Armenian language. [[Movses Khorenatsi]] mentioned that the town of Vardges was entirely rebuilt and fenced by King Vagharsh I to become known as ''Norakaghak'' (\u0546\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0584\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0584, \"New City\") and later ''Vagharshapat''.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe territory of ancient Vagharshapat was inhabited since the 3rd millennium BC. Many sites, such as [[Metsamor Castle]], Shresh hill and Mokhrablur hill date back to the [[neolithic]] period. The first written records about Vagharshapat were found in the inscriptions left by the [[Urartu|Urartian]] king [[Rusa II]] (685\u2013645 BC), where it was mentioned as ''Kuarlini'' (\u053f\u0578\u0582\u0561\u0580\u056c\u056b\u0576\u056b). The inscription found in the archaeological site of ancient Vagharshapat cites to a water canal opened by king Rusa II, between Ildaruni river ([[Hrazdan River]]) and the valley of Kuarlini.\n\nAccording to 5th-century writer [[Movses Khorenatsi]], the oldest name of Vagharshapat was ''Artimed'' (\u0531\u0580\u057f\u056b\u0574\u0567\u0564), derived from the [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek]] deity [[Artemis]]. Later, it was renamed ''Avan Vardgesi'' (\u0531\u0582\u0561\u0576 \u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u056b, \"Town of Vardges\") or ''Vardgesavan'' (\u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u0561\u0582\u0561\u0576) after being rebuilt by prince ''Vardges Manouk'' near the shores of [[Kasagh River]], during the reign of king [[Orontes I Sakavakyats]] of Armenia (570\u2013560 BC).\n\nUnder the reign of king [[Tigranes the Great]] (95\u201345 BC), the town was partly inhabited by Jewish captives.\n\nIn the first half of the 1st century AD, under the reign of the Armenian [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid]] king [[Vologases III of Parthia|Vagharsh I]] of Armenia (117\u2013144), the old town of Vardgesavan was renovated and renamed ''Vagharshapat'' (\u054e\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0580\u0577\u0561\u057a\u0561\u057f). In his first book ''Wars of Justinian'', the Byzantine historian [[Procopius]] has cited to the city as ''Valashabad'' (Balashabad), named after king ''Valash'' (Balash) of Armenia. The name evolved into its later form by the shift in the medial ''L'' into a ''Gh'', which is common in the Armenian language. [[Movses Khorenatsi]] mentioned that the Town of Vardges was entirely rebuilt and fenced by king Vagharsh I to become known as ''Noarakaghak'' (\u0546\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0584\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0584, \"New City\") and later Vagharshapat.\n[[File:Zvartnots3.jpg|thumb|The remains of the 7th-century [[Zvartnots Cathedral|Cathedral of Zvartnots]]]]\nVagharshapat has served as the capital of the Arsacid [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] between 120 AD and 330 AD. After embracing Christianity as a state religion in Armenia in 301, Vagharshapat was gradually called ''Ejmiatsin'' ({{lang-hy|\u0537\u057b\u0574\u056b\u0561\u056e\u056b\u0576}}), after the name of the [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral|Mother Cathedral]]; the seat of the Armenian Catholicosate, which is considered as one of the oldest religious organizations in the world. As a spiritual centre of the entire Armenian nation, Vagharshapat has grown up rapidly and developed as an important centre of education and culture. The city was home to one of the oldest educational institutions in Armenia founded by [[Mesrop Mashtots]].\n\nThe political capital of the Armenian kingdom was transferred to the city of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] in 336.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Grigory Gagarin.

However, the first manuscript library in Armenia was founded in 480 in Vagharshapat.\n\nThe Armenian Church rejected the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451) because they believed the Chalcedonian [[christology]] was too similar to [[Nestorianism]]; however, some Armenian bishops who were present in the territories of [[Roman Armenia]] signed the Council's documents and also accepted [[Pope Leo I]]'s 458 [[encyclical]] mandating adherence to the [[Chalcedonian Definition]]. In [[Persarmenia]], the [[Church of the East|Persian Nestorian Church]] supported the spread of Nestorianism, which the Armenian Church had previously declared heretical and saw as a threat to the independence of their Church.

It was designed by architects Jim Torosyan and Romeo Julhakyan and consecrated on 26 September 2008, while the construction was funded by the British-Armenian philanthropist Armen Sarkissian.\n\nThe [[Church of the Holy Archangels, Vagharshapat|Church of the Holy Archangels]] was built between 2009 and 2011 and located in the yard of Gevorkian Seminary building. The single-domed church was consecrated on 5 November 2011. It was designed by architect Jim Torosyan. The construction work was funded by the Armenian philanthropist Gagik Galstyan.\n\n====[[Saint Hripsime Church]]====\nBuilt in 618, the Church of Saint Hripsim\u00e9 has basically survived almost unchanged. It is considered one of the oldest surviving churches in Armenia, known for its fine architecture of the classical period, which influenced many other Armenian churches. It was erected in 618 by Catholicos [[Komitas Aghtsetsi|Gomidas]] atop the original mausoleum, built by Catholicos [[Sahak the Great]] in 395, which contained the remains of the martyred Saint [[Hripsime|Hripsim\u00e9]]. According to the 17th century Armenian historian [[Arakel of Tabriz]], the church was renovated during 1651\u20131653 by Catholicos [[Philip I of Armenia|Philip I]]. Repairs were made on the roof, top of the dome, the walls and bases. A cross was placed on top of the roof, and a small portico was added to the western side. It is one of the few churches in Armenian that remained active during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period.\n\n====[[Saint Gayane Church]]====\nBuilt in 630 by Catholicos [[Ezra I of Armenia|Ezra I]], Saint Gayane Church is distinguished by its harmonious proportions. It is a three-[[nave]] domed [[basilica]] with an octagonal [[tholobate|drum]] resting on four internal pillars that divide the interior of the church into three. Its design remained unchanged despite partial renovations of the dome and some ceilings in 1652.\n\n====[[Shoghakat Church]]==== \nMeaning ''drop of light'', Shoghakat Church is a single-nave domed basilica, built and completed in 1694 by prince Aghamal Sorotetsi during the period of Catholicos [[Nahabed I of Armenia|Nahabed I]]. It is built with red and black [[tufa]] stones, erected on the remains of a 6th-century basilica.

It is at the eastern edge of modern-day Vagharshapat. Zvartnots was a majestic cathedral famous for its unique design, dedicated to [[Saint George]], built at the place where a meeting between king [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]] and Saint [[Gregory the Illuminator]] was supposed to have taken place. In 930, the church was ruined by an earthquake and remained buried until it was rediscovered in the early 20th century by architect [[Toros Toramanian]]. The site was excavated between 1900 and 1907, uncovering the foundations of the cathedral as well as the remains of the Pontifical palace and a winery.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\">\nFile:Ejmiadzin Cathedral.jpg|Etchmiadzin Cathedral, opened in 303\nFile:S.

Later, it was renamed ''Avan Vardgesi'' (\u0531\u0582\u0561\u0576 \u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u056b, \"Town of Vardges\") or ''Vardgesavan'' (\u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u0561\u0582\u0561\u0576) by Prince Vardges Manouk who rebuilt the settlement near the shores of [[Kasagh River]], during the reign of King [[Orontes I Sakavakyats]] of Armenia (570\u2013560 BC). However, in his first book, ''Wars of Justinian'', the Byzantine historian [[Procopius]] refers to the city as ''Valashabad'' (Balashabad), named after King Valash (Balash) of Armenia. The name evolved into its later form by the shift of the medial ''l'' into a ''gh'', which is common in the Armenian language. [[Movses Khorenatsi]] mentioned that the town of Vardges was entirely rebuilt and fenced by King Vagharsh I to become known as ''Norakaghak'' (\u0546\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0584\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0584, \"New City\") and later ''Vagharshapat''.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe territory of ancient Vagharshapat was inhabited since the 3rd millennium BC. Many sites, such as [[Metsamor Castle]], Shresh hill and Mokhrablur hill date back to the [[neolithic]] period. The first written records about Vagharshapat were found in the inscriptions left by the [[Urartu|Urartian]] king [[Rusa II]] (685\u2013645 BC), where it was mentioned as ''Kuarlini'' (\u053f\u0578\u0582\u0561\u0580\u056c\u056b\u0576\u056b). The inscription found in the archaeological site of ancient Vagharshapat cites to a water canal opened by king Rusa II, between Ildaruni river ([[Hrazdan River]]) and the valley of Kuarlini.\n\nAccording to 5th-century writer [[Movses Khorenatsi]], the oldest name of Vagharshapat was ''Artimed'' (\u0531\u0580\u057f\u056b\u0574\u0567\u0564), derived from the [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek]] deity [[Artemis]]. Later, it was renamed ''Avan Vardgesi'' (\u0531\u0582\u0561\u0576 \u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u056b, \"Town of Vardges\") or ''Vardgesavan'' (\u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u0561\u0582\u0561\u0576) after being rebuilt by prince ''Vardges Manouk'' near the shores of [[Kasagh River]], during the reign of king [[Orontes I Sakavakyats]] of Armenia (570\u2013560 BC).\n\nUnder the reign of king [[Tigranes the Great]] (95\u201345 BC), the town was partly inhabited by Jewish captives.\n\nIn the first half of the 1st century AD, under the reign of the Armenian [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid]] king [[Vologases III of Parthia|Vagharsh I]] of Armenia (117\u2013144), the old town of Vardgesavan was renovated and renamed ''Vagharshapat'' (\u054e\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0580\u0577\u0561\u057a\u0561\u057f). In his first book ''Wars of Justinian'', the Byzantine historian [[Procopius]] has cited to the city as ''Valashabad'' (Balashabad), named after king ''Valash'' (Balash) of Armenia. The name evolved into its later form by the shift in the medial ''L'' into a ''Gh'', which is common in the Armenian language. [[Movses Khorenatsi]] mentioned that the Town of Vardges was entirely rebuilt and fenced by king Vagharsh I to become known as ''Noarakaghak'' (\u0546\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0584\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0584, \"New City\") and later Vagharshapat.\n[[File:Zvartnots3.jpg|thumb|The remains of the 7th-century [[Zvartnots Cathedral|Cathedral of Zvartnots]]]]\nVagharshapat has served as the capital of the Arsacid [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] between 120 AD and 330 AD. After embracing Christianity as a state religion in Armenia in 301, Vagharshapat was gradually called ''Ejmiatsin'' ({{lang-hy|\u0537\u057b\u0574\u056b\u0561\u056e\u056b\u0576}}), after the name of the [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral|Mother Cathedral]]; the seat of the Armenian Catholicosate, which is considered as one of the oldest religious organizations in the world. As a spiritual centre of the entire Armenian nation, Vagharshapat has grown up rapidly and developed as an important centre of education and culture. The city was home to one of the oldest educational institutions in Armenia founded by [[Mesrop Mashtots]].\n\nThe political capital of the Armenian kingdom was transferred to the city of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] in 336.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Grigory Gagarin. Escarmouche de Persans et de Kurdes.jpg|thumb|Kurds and Persians attacking Vagharshapat]]\nVagharshapat maintained its status as the country's most important city until the fall of the Arsacid Kingdom in 428. The city has gradually lost its importance under the Persian rule, specifically when the seat of the Catholicosate was transferred to [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] in 452. However, the first manuscript library in Armenia was founded in 480 in Vagharshapat.\n\nThe Armenian Church rejected the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451) because they believed the Chalcedonian [[christology]] was too similar to [[Nestorianism]]; however, some Armenian bishops who were present in the territories of [[Roman Armenia]] signed the Council's documents and also accepted [[Pope Leo I]]'s 458 [[encyclical]] mandating adherence to the [[Chalcedonian Definition]]. In [[Persarmenia]], the [[Church of the East|Persian Nestorian Church]] supported the spread of Nestorianism, which the Armenian Church had previously declared heretical and saw as a threat to the independence of their Church. [[Peter the Iberian]], a [[Georgian people|Georgian]] prince, also strongly opposed the Chalcedonian Creed.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Wydawnictwo UJ| isbn = 978-83-233-9555-3| last = Stopka| first = Krzysztof| title = Armenia Christiana: Armenian Religious Identity and the Churches of Constantinople and Rome (4th\u201315th Century)| date = 16 December 2016 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eeq-DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA64|pages=62-}}</ref> Thus, in 491, Catholicos [[Babken I of Armenia]], along with the [[Caucasian Albania|Albanian]] and [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberian]] bishops met in Vagharshapat and issued a condemnation of the Chalcedonian Definition.<ref>''Zvartnots and the Origins of Christian Architecture in Armenia'', W.

The city was briefly revived between the 9th and 11th centuries under the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratid]] [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Kingdom of Armenia]], before being overrun by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in 1045 and later by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]] in 1064.\n\nIn the middle of the 13th century, Vagharshapat became part of the [[Ilkhanate]] of the [[Mongol Empire]]. During the last quarter of the 14th century the [[Aq Qoyunlu]] Sunni [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz Turkic]] tribe took over Armenia, including Vagharshapat.\n\nIn 1400, when [[Timur]] invaded Armenia and Georgia many districts including Vagharshapat were depopulated under the rule of the [[Timurid Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbedrosian.com/atmi4.htm |title=The Turco-Mongol Invasions |publisher=Rbedrosian.com |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>{{self published inline|date=November 2018}} In 1410, Armenia fell under the control of the [[Kara Koyunlu]] Shia Oghuz Turkic tribe.

It was finally completed between 1939 and 1943. In 1945, the town of Vagharshapat was officially renamed ''Etchmiadzin'' by the Soviet government.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, the town has witnessed a massive wave of construction, including residential buildings and industrial plants. By the end of the 1960s, the historical monuments of the town; including the religious complex of the [[Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin]], [[Saint Hripsime Church]], [[Saint Gayane Church]] and the surrounding area of [[Zvartnots Cathedral]], were entirely rehabilitated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ejmiatsin.am/mer-qaxaq/patmutyun/42--.html|title=\u054a\u0531\u054f\u0544\u0531\u053f\u0531\u0546 \u0531\u053f\u0546\u0531\u0550\u053f}}</ref>\n\nAfter the independence of Armenia, the town was officially renamed Vagharshapat in 1995.

It is considered one of the oldest surviving churches in Armenia, known for its fine architecture of the classical period, which influenced many other Armenian churches. It was erected in 618 by Catholicos [[Komitas Aghtsetsi|Gomidas]] atop the original mausoleum, built by Catholicos [[Sahak the Great]] in 395, which contained the remains of the martyred Saint [[Hripsime|Hripsim\u00e9]]. According to the 17th century Armenian historian [[Arakel of Tabriz]], the church was renovated during 1651\u20131653 by Catholicos [[Philip I of Armenia|Philip I]]. Repairs were made on the roof, top of the dome, the walls and bases. A cross was placed on top of the roof, and a small portico was added to the western side.

In 930, the church was ruined by an earthquake and remained buried until it was rediscovered in the early 20th century by architect [[Toros Toramanian]].

This set of buildings remains the core of the college to this day and this accounts for its distinctly monastic architectural style, which sets it apart from other Cambridge colleges. A library was soon added, and the chapel was considerably modified and reduced in scale by Alcock. At its foundation, the college had a master, six fellows and six scholars.<ref name=\"SOC\">{{cite book|author=Society of gentlemen|title=The Biographical Dictionary, Or, Complete Historical Library: Containing the Lives of the Most Celebrated Personages of Great Britain and Ireland, Whether Admirals, Generals, Poets, Statesmen, Philosophers, Or Divines : a Work Replete with Instruction and Entertainment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jtQAQAAIAAJ|year=1780|publisher=F.

In common with other Cambridge colleges, this privilege is only extended during Easter term.\n[[File:Jesus College, Cambridge by Loggan 1690 - Folger 046539W5.jpg|thumb|Jesus College in 1690, by [[David Loggan]]]]\n\n== Chapel and Choir ==\n\n=== Jesus College Chapel ===\n[[File:The Chapel, Jesus College, Cambridge - geograph.org.uk - 1057669.jpg|thumb|Jesus Chapel]]\nThe College Chapel was founded in 1157 and took until 1245 to complete, and is believed to be the oldest university building in Cambridge still in use. Originally it was the [[St Radegund's Priory, Cambridge|Benedictine Convent of St Mary and St]] [[Radegund]], which was dissolved by [[John Alcock (bishop)|Bishop John Alcock]].\n\nThe original structure of the chapel was cruciform in shape and the nave had both north and south aisles. A high, pitched roof was surmounted by a belfry and steeple; this collapsed in 1277. The chapel was also used as the parish church of St Radegund. Twice the chapel was ravaged by fire, in 1313 and 1376.\n\nWhen the College took over the precincts during the 15th century, the parish was renamed after the College as Jesus parish, with the churchyard still being used for burials. This, however, was short lived, as by the middle of the 16th century Jesus parish was absorbed into that of All Saints. Significant alterations were carried out to the church under Alcock, transforming the cathedral-sized church, which was the largest in Cambridge into a College chapel for a small group of scholars. A large part of the original nave was replaced by College rooms, and subsequently part of the Master's Lodge.\n\nThe [[misericord]]s were created by the famous English architect [[Augustus Pugin]] between 1849 and 1853. Pugin used fragments of the misericords dating from 1500, which had been preserved in the Master's Lodge as templates. Repairs were also undertaken by [[George Frederick Bodley]] between 1864 and 1867.\n\nSaid and sung services are held every day during term. Choral [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]] take place four times a week (Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays), and sung [[Eucharist]] on Sunday mornings. There are also [[Compline]] twice a term, as well as Masses on major holy days.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/college/life-jesus/chapel-and-choir/chapel-services-events-and-hire|title=Chapel services, events, and hire|last=College|first=Jesus|work=Jesus College University of Cambridge|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en}}</ref> The Chapel, famed for its warm but clean acoustics, is also a much sought-after space for concerts and recitals, as well as recordings.\n\n=== Jesus College Choir ===\n[[File:Jesus College Glass.jpg|thumb|Stained glass of John Alcock]]\nJesus College maintains two highly regarded choirs, the College Choir and the Chapel Choir.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/chapel-choir/choir/|title=Choir - Jesus College Cambridge|publisher=|access-date=27 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430021514/http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/chapel-choir/choir/|archive-date=30 April 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \n* ''The College Choir'' consists of male and female students and sings regular services twice a week in the chapel.

[[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]] is sung by the College Choir on Tuesdays at 6.30pm and Sundays at 6pm during Full Term; Sunday Eucharists are sung by a consort of singers from the College Choir.\n*''The Chapel Choir'', which is likely to have existed since the foundation of the College, consists of around 20 choristers combined with the gentlemen of the College Choir and also sings services twice a week in the chapel. It is unique among Cambridge college choirs in that the choristers are volunteers: that is, they are drawn from schools around the city and do not attend a particular [[choir school]].

Tu das illis escam tempore opportuno. Aperis tu manus, et imples omne animal benedictione tua.'' \n''Benedic nobis, Domine, et omnibus tuis donis, quae ex larga liberalitate tua sumpturi sumus, per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum. Deus est caritas. Qui manet in caritate manet in Deo et Deus in illo. Sit Deus in nobis, et nos maneamus in illo.'' <br/>\n</blockquote>\n\nTranslated into English, the ''Oratio Ante Cibum'' reads as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe eyes of all look towards you and trust in you, O God. You give them food in due season. You open your hands and fill every living thing with your blessing. Bless us, O Lord, and all your gifts, which through your great generosity we are about to receive, through Jesus Christ our Lord. God is love. He who abides in love abides in God and God in him. May God be in us and may we abide in him. <br/>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== After dinner ===\nThe following ''Oratio Post Cibum'' is sometimes read after dinner:\n\n<blockquote>\n''Deus pacis et dilectionis semper maneat nobiscum; tu autem, Domine, miserere nostrum. Agimus tibi gratias pro omnibus tuis beneficiis, qui vivis et regnas, Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. Deus conservet Ecclesiam, Reginam, regnum, senatum, et pacem.'' <br/>\n</blockquote>\n\nTranslated into English, the ''Oratio Post Cibum'' [\"Prayer After Food\"<ref>{{cite web \n| url         = https://translate.google.com/#la/en/Oratio%20Post%20Cibum \n| title       = English translation, (according to Google Translate), of the Latin phrase \"''Oratio Post Cibum''\" \n| publisher   = [[Google]] [[Google Translate|Translate]] \n| accessdate  = 9 January 2015 \n}}</ref>] reads as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\nMay the God of peace and love always abide with us; have mercy upon us, O Lord. We thank you for all your mercies, who live and reign, God, for ever and ever. May God preserve the Church, the Queen, the realm, Parliament and peace. <br/>\n</blockquote>\n\nHowever after a normal formal dinner in Hall the following short [[responsory]] is usually used:\n* The Presiding Fellow: ''Laus Deo'' (Praise be to God) \n* The College: ''Deo Gratias'' (Thanks be to God)\n\n== Student life ==\n[[File:Jesus College May Ball, 2012 2.JPG|thumb|Jesus College May Ball, 2012]]\n\n=== Student societies ===\nAlthough Jesus College is one of the older colleges at the university, it is known for having a relaxed and informal atmosphere. This is in large part attributable to its active student unions, the Jesus College Student Union (JCSU) and the Jesus College Graduate Union (MCR). These unions organise a wide range of social, cultural, welfare and sporting events throughout the year. The John Hughes Arts Festival, founded by College students in 2014 in memory of the late Dean of Chapel, [[John Hughes (theologian)|John Hughes]], enters its third year in 2017, providing a broad programme of arts events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jhaf.org.uk/|title=JHAF - Illuminate|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nJesus College hosts an annual [[May Ball]].

The college typically fields a number of teams in each sport. The [[Jesus College Boat Club (Cambridge)|Jesus College Boat Club]] is particularly strong, with the 1st Men's VIII never having dropped below 12th place in the [[May Bumps]] and 11th position in the [[Lent Bumps]]. The JCBC organises the annual Fairbairn Cup Races.\n\n=== Hall ===\nA three-course dinner known as Formal Hall is served in the college's main dining hall five nights a week. [[Academic gown|Gowns]] are worn by all members of the college, along with lounge suit for men and formal dress for women. A four-course dinner for graduate students of the college known as Grad Hall is served in Upper Hall each Wednesday. Unlike most traditional Oxbridge colleges, the college allows graduate students to dine at [[High Table]] on Tuesdays.\n\nThe college also offers informal dining at lunch and dinner known as Caff, as well as brunch on Saturday mornings and a carvery lunch on Sundays. The college also has a popular student bar known as JBar which sells a wide variety of drinks, including JPA (Jesus Pale Ale).<ref>https://jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk/?page_id=94</ref>\n\n== Masters and fellows ==\n\n=== Masters of the college ===\n{{further|List of Masters of Jesus College, Cambridge}}\n\n[[Sonita Alleyne]] was elected [[List of Masters of Jesus College, Cambridge|master]] of the college in 2019.

Its common name comes from the name of its chapel, [[#Jesus College Chapel|Jesus Chapel]].\n\nJesus College was established between 1496 and 1516 on the site of the twelfth-century Benedictine nunnery of [[St Radegund's Priory, Cambridge|St Mary and St Radegund]] by [[John Alcock (bishop)|John Alcock]], then [[Bishop of Ely]]. The [[cockerel]] is the symbol of Jesus College, after the surname of its founder.\n\nJesus College has assets of approximately \u00a3344m making it Cambridge\u2019s fifth-wealthiest college.

She will be the first woman to hold the role, 40 years after the college began admitting women as students.\n\n==History==\nWhen founded in 1496, the College consisted of buildings taken over from the [[St Radegund's Priory, Cambridge|Nunnery]] of St Mary and St [[Radegund]], which was founded at the beginning of the 12th century; the Chapel is the oldest university building in Cambridge still in use, and predates the foundation of the College by 350 years, the University by half a century.\n\nThe Benedictine Convent, upon dissolution, included the chapel and the cloister attached to it; the nuns\u2019 refectory, which became the college hall; and the former lodging of the prioress, which became the Master\u2019s Lodge. This set of buildings remains the core of the college to this day and this accounts for its distinctly monastic architectural style, which sets it apart from other Cambridge colleges. A library was soon added, and the chapel was considerably modified and reduced in scale by Alcock. At its foundation, the college had a master, six fellows and six scholars.<ref name=\"SOC\">{{cite book|author=Society of gentlemen|title=The Biographical Dictionary, Or, Complete Historical Library: Containing the Lives of the Most Celebrated Personages of Great Britain and Ireland, Whether Admirals, Generals, Poets, Statesmen, Philosophers, Or Divines : a Work Replete with Instruction and Entertainment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jtQAQAAIAAJ|year=1780|publisher=F.

Originally it was the [[St Radegund's Priory, Cambridge|Benedictine Convent of St Mary and St]] [[Radegund]], which was dissolved by [[John Alcock (bishop)|Bishop John Alcock]].\n\nThe original structure of the chapel was cruciform in shape and the nave had both north and south aisles. A high, pitched roof was surmounted by a belfry and steeple; this collapsed in 1277. The chapel was also used as the parish church of St Radegund. Twice the chapel was ravaged by fire, in 1313 and 1376.\n\nWhen the College took over the precincts during the 15th century, the parish was renamed after the College as Jesus parish, with the churchyard still being used for burials. This, however, was short lived, as by the middle of the 16th century Jesus parish was absorbed into that of All Saints. Significant alterations were carried out to the church under Alcock, transforming the cathedral-sized church, which was the largest in Cambridge into a College chapel for a small group of scholars. A large part of the original nave was replaced by College rooms, and subsequently part of the Master's Lodge.\n\nThe [[misericord]]s were created by the famous English architect [[Augustus Pugin]] between 1849 and 1853. Pugin used fragments of the misericords dating from 1500, which had been preserved in the Master's Lodge as templates. Repairs were also undertaken by [[George Frederick Bodley]] between 1864 and 1867.\n\nSaid and sung services are held every day during term. Choral [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]] take place four times a week (Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays), and sung [[Eucharist]] on Sunday mornings. There are also [[Compline]] twice a term, as well as Masses on major holy days.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/college/life-jesus/chapel-and-choir/chapel-services-events-and-hire|title=Chapel services, events, and hire|last=College|first=Jesus|work=Jesus College University of Cambridge|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en}}</ref> The Chapel, famed for its warm but clean acoustics, is also a much sought-after space for concerts and recitals, as well as recordings.\n\n=== Jesus College Choir ===\n[[File:Jesus College Glass.jpg|thumb|Stained glass of John Alcock]]\nJesus College maintains two highly regarded choirs, the College Choir and the Chapel Choir.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/chapel-choir/choir/|title=Choir - Jesus College Cambridge|publisher=|access-date=27 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430021514/http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/chapel-choir/choir/|archive-date=30 April 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \n* ''The College Choir'' consists of male and female students and sings regular services twice a week in the chapel.

Bless us, O Lord, and all your gifts, which through your great generosity we are about to receive, through Jesus Christ our Lord. God is love. He who abides in love abides in God and God in him. May God be in us and may we abide in him. <br/>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== After dinner ===\nThe following ''Oratio Post Cibum'' is sometimes read after dinner:\n\n<blockquote>\n''Deus pacis et dilectionis semper maneat nobiscum; tu autem, Domine, miserere nostrum. Agimus tibi gratias pro omnibus tuis beneficiis, qui vivis et regnas, Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. Deus conservet Ecclesiam, Reginam, regnum, senatum, et pacem.'' <br/>\n</blockquote>\n\nTranslated into English, the ''Oratio Post Cibum'' [\"Prayer After Food\"<ref>{{cite web \n| url         = https://translate.google.com/#la/en/Oratio%20Post%20Cibum \n| title       = English translation, (according to Google Translate), of the Latin phrase \"''Oratio Post Cibum''\" \n| publisher   = [[Google]] [[Google Translate|Translate]] \n| accessdate  = 9 January 2015 \n}}</ref>] reads as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\nMay the God of peace and love always abide with us; have mercy upon us, O Lord. We thank you for all your mercies, who live and reign, God, for ever and ever. May God preserve the Church, the Queen, the realm, Parliament and peace. <br/>\n</blockquote>\n\nHowever after a normal formal dinner in Hall the following short [[responsory]] is usually used:\n* The Presiding Fellow: ''Laus Deo'' (Praise be to God) \n* The College: ''Deo Gratias'' (Thanks be to God)\n\n== Student life ==\n[[File:Jesus College May Ball, 2012 2.JPG|thumb|Jesus College May Ball, 2012]]\n\n=== Student societies ===\nAlthough Jesus College is one of the older colleges at the university, it is known for having a relaxed and informal atmosphere. This is in large part attributable to its active student unions, the Jesus College Student Union (JCSU) and the Jesus College Graduate Union (MCR). These unions organise a wide range of social, cultural, welfare and sporting events throughout the year. The John Hughes Arts Festival, founded by College students in 2014 in memory of the late Dean of Chapel, [[John Hughes (theologian)|John Hughes]], enters its third year in 2017, providing a broad programme of arts events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jhaf.org.uk/|title=JHAF - Illuminate|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nJesus College hosts an annual [[May Ball]].

The college typically fields a number of teams in each sport. The [[Jesus College Boat Club (Cambridge)|Jesus College Boat Club]] is particularly strong, with the 1st Men's VIII never having dropped below 12th place in the [[May Bumps]] and 11th position in the [[Lent Bumps]]. The JCBC organises the annual Fairbairn Cup Races.\n\n=== Hall ===\nA three-course dinner known as Formal Hall is served in the college's main dining hall five nights a week. [[Academic gown|Gowns]] are worn by all members of the college, along with lounge suit for men and formal dress for women. A four-course dinner for graduate students of the college known as Grad Hall is served in Upper Hall each Wednesday. Unlike most traditional Oxbridge colleges, the college allows graduate students to dine at [[High Table]] on Tuesdays.\n\nThe college also offers informal dining at lunch and dinner known as Caff, as well as brunch on Saturday mornings and a carvery lunch on Sundays. The college also has a popular student bar known as JBar which sells a wide variety of drinks, including JPA (Jesus Pale Ale).<ref>https://jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk/?page_id=94</ref>\n\n== Masters and fellows ==\n\n=== Masters of the college ===\n{{further|List of Masters of Jesus College, Cambridge}}\n\n[[Sonita Alleyne]] was elected [[List of Masters of Jesus College, Cambridge|master]] of the college in 2019.

At that time, racing tires were either [[Slick tire|slick tires]] made with the [[cross ply]] technique (very wide tyres with a reduced sidewall height), or [[radial tire]], which were too narrow to withstand the Stratos' power and did not provide enough grip. Both were unusable for the Lancia Stratos, as the radials were destroyed within 10&nbsp;km, and the slicks too stiff. Lancia asked Pirelli for a solution, and in 1975 Pirelli created a wide tire with a reduced sidewall height like a slick, but with a radial structure.\n\nSubsequently, Porsche started using the same tires with the [[Porsche 911 Turbo]].\n\nIn 1988, Pirelli acquired the Armstrong Rubber Company, which was headquartered in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], for $190 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://connecticuthistory.org/armstrong-finds-a-niche-in-the-tire-market |title=Armstrong Finds a Niche in the Tire Market | publisher=Connecticut Humanities |accessdate=22 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Pirelli sold its terrestrial fibre optic cables business to [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] and its optical components operations to [[Corning Inc.|Corning]], for 5 billion euro.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/cisco-taps-pirelli-for-optical-technology/|title=Cisco taps Pirelli for optical technology|work=CNET|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en}}</ref> It invested \u2013 through Olimpia -part of the resulting liquidity to become a majority shareholder in [[Telecom Italia]] in 2001,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/jul/30/citynews.media|title=Pirelli seizes Telecom Italia|last=Hepher|first=Tim|date=2001-07-30|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> maintaining this position until 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c44c1ef6-d1d0-11db-b921-000b5df10621.html?ft_site=falcon&desktop=true#axzz4igYZpn9S|title=Tronchetti/Telecom Italia|date=2007-03-14|work=Financial Times|access-date=2017-05-31|issn=0307-1766}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 2002 the company started a range of Pirelli branded clothing, watches and eyewear.<ref>\n[http://www.pirelli.com/corporate/en/company/brand/ind-design/default.html official website]</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Pirelli sold its Cables, Energy Systems and Telecommunications assets to [[Goldman Sachs]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.penews.com/magazine/analysis/content/content/541211/restricted|title=Goldman Sachs buys Pirelli Cables for \u20ac1.3bn|website=www.penews.com|access-date=2017-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805124509/http://www.penews.com/magazine/analysis/content/content/541211/restricted|archive-date=5 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the newly formed company was named [[Prysmian Group|Prysmian]].

At that time, racing tires were either [[Slick tire|slick tires]] made with the [[cross ply]] technique (very wide tyres with a reduced sidewall height), or [[radial tire]], which were too narrow to withstand the Stratos' power and did not provide enough grip. Both were unusable for the Lancia Stratos, as the radials were destroyed within 10&nbsp;km, and the slicks too stiff. Lancia asked Pirelli for a solution, and in 1975 Pirelli created a wide tire with a reduced sidewall height like a slick, but with a radial structure.\n\nSubsequently, Porsche started using the same tires with the [[Porsche 911 Turbo]].\n\nIn 1988, Pirelli acquired the Armstrong Rubber Company, which was headquartered in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], for $190 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://connecticuthistory.org/armstrong-finds-a-niche-in-the-tire-market |title=Armstrong Finds a Niche in the Tire Market | publisher=Connecticut Humanities |accessdate=22 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Pirelli sold its terrestrial fibre optic cables business to [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] and its optical components operations to [[Corning Inc.|Corning]], for 5 billion euro.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/cisco-taps-pirelli-for-optical-technology/|title=Cisco taps Pirelli for optical technology|work=CNET|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en}}</ref> It invested \u2013 through Olimpia -part of the resulting liquidity to become a majority shareholder in [[Telecom Italia]] in 2001,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/jul/30/citynews.media|title=Pirelli seizes Telecom Italia|last=Hepher|first=Tim|date=2001-07-30|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> maintaining this position until 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c44c1ef6-d1d0-11db-b921-000b5df10621.html?ft_site=falcon&desktop=true#axzz4igYZpn9S|title=Tronchetti/Telecom Italia|date=2007-03-14|work=Financial Times|access-date=2017-05-31|issn=0307-1766}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 2002 the company started a range of Pirelli branded clothing, watches and eyewear.<ref>\n[http://www.pirelli.com/corporate/en/company/brand/ind-design/default.html official website]</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Pirelli sold its Cables, Energy Systems and Telecommunications assets to [[Goldman Sachs]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.penews.com/magazine/analysis/content/content/541211/restricted|title=Goldman Sachs buys Pirelli Cables for \u20ac1.3bn|website=www.penews.com|access-date=2017-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805124509/http://www.penews.com/magazine/analysis/content/content/541211/restricted|archive-date=5 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the newly formed company was named [[Prysmian Group|Prysmian]].
