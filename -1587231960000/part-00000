[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach has proposed that the secretarybird was depicted as ''bistarda deserti'' in the 13th century work ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'' penned by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].

The earliest [[fossil]]s associated with the family are two species from the genus ''[[Pelargopappus]]''. The two species, from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family.

This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency.

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach has proposed that the secretarybird was depicted as ''bistarda deserti'' in the 13th century work ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'' penned by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].

The two species, from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France.

Only with small prey items such as wasps will the bird use its bill to pick prey items directly. There are some reports that, when capturing snakes, a secretarybird will take flight with their prey and then drop them to their death, although this has not been verified.

This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency.

Singers need to use English since the companies want to occupy markets in the other parts of Asia, which enables them to open the Western market in the end. Most of the K-pop singers learn English because it is a common language in the world of music, but some singers also learn other foreign languages such as Japanese to approach the Japanese market.<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\"/> Similarly, increasing numbers of K-pop bands use English names rather than Korean ones. This allows songs and artists to be marketed to a wider audience around the world.<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\" />\n\n<!--I think the source for this is describing J-pop--><!--East Asia has many different languages, which makes recording in English a working choice to make up the language gap that disturbs the international music communication. Nonetheless, probably because singers do not want to take the risk of presenting a wrong identity, this option is certainly not used most commonly. Musicians who understand both cultures and are fluent English speakers such as [[Tata Young]] and [[Utada Hikaru]] have the most success while using this method to have international music markets. The reason why the frequency of the strategy is comparatively low is because not many East Asian artists have fluent English skills, which people often make comments about a singer's English fluency. More importantly, the East Asian music wave is not simply about the sounds and products of music. Flows of language and identity come with the East Asian wave, and more of these flows will enable researchers to have a better understanding of the international flow in East Asian music.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=Phil|date=January 2013|title=English and identity in East Asian popular music|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/popular-music/article/english-and-identity-in-east-asian-popular-music/89BC456C9A2FEA66D58DC36FD613FB3B|journal=Popular Music|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=23\u201333|doi=10.1017/S0261143012000529|issn=0261-1430}}</ref>\n-->\nHowever, the use of English has not guaranteed the popularity of K-pop in the North American market. For some commentators, the reason for this is because the genre can be seen as a distilled version of Western music, making it difficult for K-pop to find acceptance in these markets.<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\" /> Furthermore, Western audiences tend to place emphasis on authenticity and individual expression in music, which the idol system can be seen as suppressing.<ref name=\"Chosun Ilbo\"/> \nAccording to Elaine W. Chun's research, even though [[hybridity]] appears more and more often in K-pop, and sometimes may even make fans admire K-pop stars more because it is fresh, new and interesting, it is hard to change those who believe in a perfect ideal for pure linguistic. This means that the original form of language is still difficult to alter.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chun|first=Elaine W.|date=February 2017|title=How to drop a name: Hybridity, purity, and the K-pop fan|journal=Language in Society|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=57\u201376|doi=10.1017/S0047404516000828|issn=0047-4045}}</ref>\n\nArtist names, song titles, and lyrics have exhibited a significant growth in the usage of English words. No singers in the top fifty charts in 1990 had English in their names: people who worked in the Korean music industry viewed using Korean names as standard. In 1995, most popular singers such as [[Kim Gun-mo]], Park Mi-kyung, [[Park Jin-young]], [[Lee Seung-chul]], and [[Byun Jin-sub]] still used Korean names, but fourteen of the singers and groups in the top fifty used English names, including [[DJ DOC]], [[015B]], Piano, and [[Solid (band)|Solid]]. After the 1997 financial crisis, the government stopped censoring English lyrics and Korea started to have a boom in English. Since the late 1990s, English usage in singers' names, song titles, and lyrics has grown quickly. Seventeen singers in the top fifty charts used English names in 2000, and thirty-one did so in 2005. In 2010, forty-one  singers used English names among the top fifty songs, but usually three or four singers and groups had more than one or two songs on the chart simultaneously. Korean names (e.g. [[Baek Ji-young]], [[Seo In-young]], and [[Huh Gak]]) are seen less frequently, and many K-pop singers have English names (e.g. [[IU (singer)|IU]], [[Sistar]], [[T-ara]], [[GD & TOP]], [[Beast (South Korean band)|Beast]], and [[After School (band)|After School]]). Notably, until the early 1990s, musicians with English names would [[transliterate]] them into [[hangul]], but now singers would use English names written with the [[Latin script|roman alphabet]].<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\"/> In 1995, the percentage of song titles using English in the top 50 charts was 8%. This fluctuated between 30% in 2000, 18% in 2005, and 44% in 2010. An example of a Korean song with a large proportion of English lyrics is [[Kara (South Korean band)|Kara]]'s \"[[Jumping (Kara song)|Jumping]],\" which was released at the same time in both Korea and Japan to much success.<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\" />\n\n====Criticism of hybrid identity====\nThere have been critical responses in South Korea regarding the identity of the genre since its ascendance. Some of the notable music critics in the region have criticized K-pop as \"a industrial label mainly designed to promote the national brand in the global market from the beginning\" and argued that it was \"not formed spontaneously as a pop culture but created with the orchestrated plan led by the government with commercial considerations\" although in fact \"the genre has practically no ties with traditional Korean identity\".

For example, the song \"Oh My Darling, Clementine\" became known as \"Simcheongga.\"<ref group=\"note\">Not to be confused with the [[pansori]] story [[Simcheongga|of the same name]].</ref> During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] (1910\u20131945) the popularity of ''changga'' songs rose as Koreans expressed their feelings against Japanese oppression through music. One of the most popular songs was \"Huimangga\" (\ud76c\ub9dd\uac00, The Song of Hope). The Japanese confiscated the existing ''changga'' collections and published lyrics books of their own.<ref name=\"newforce47-492\">''K-Pop: A New Force in Pop Music'', pp. 47\u201379</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe first known Korean pop album was \"Yi Pungjin Sewol\" (This Tumultuous Time), by Park Chae-seon and Lee Ryu-saek in 1925, which contained popular songs translated from Japanese. The first pop song written by a Korean composer is thought to be \"Nakhwayusu\" (\ub099\ud654\uc720\uc218, Fallen Blossoms on Running Water) sung by Lee Jeong-suk in 1929.<ref name=\"newforce47-492\" /> In the mid-1920s, Japanese composer [[Masao Koga]] mixed traditional Korean music with Gospel music that American Evangelists introduced in the 1870s. This type of music became known as [[Enka]] in Japan, and later in Korea developed into [[Trot (music)|Trot]] ({{lang-ko|\"\ud2b8\ub85c\ud2b8\"}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jpnews.kr/sub_read.html?uid=8082&section=sc1&section2=%C0%CE%B9%B0|title=JPNews \uc77c\ubcf8\uc774 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4! \uc77c\ubcf8\ub274\uc2a4\ud3ec\ud138!|publisher=Jpnews.kr|accessdate=January 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=\uace0\uac00\ub9c8\uc0ac\uc624|encyclopedia=Doosan Encyclopedia|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?cid=200000000&docId=1164528&mobile&categoryId=200001546|accessdate=January 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===1940s\u20131960s: Arrival of Western culture===\n[[File:Marilyn Monroe.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Marilyn Monroe poses as a crowd of soldiers photograph her|[[Marilyn Monroe]] entertaining American soldiers in Korea in 1954]]\nAfter the [[Korean Peninsula]] was partitioned into North and South following its liberation in 1945 from [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]], [[Western culture]] was introduced into South Korea on a small scale, with a few Western-styled bars and clubs playing Western music. After the [[Korean War]] (1950\u201353) U.S. troops remained in South Korea, causing American and world culture to spread in South Korea and Western music to gradually become more accepted.

Since South Korea was impoverished after the Korean War, skilled Korean singers regarded performing for the U.S. troops as a good means to earn money. Many singers sang for the American troops, usually in dedicated clubs, the number of which rose to 264. They performed various genres like country music, blues, jazz and rock & roll. The [[Economy of South Korea|South Korean economy]] started blooming and popular music followed the trend, spread by the first commercial radio stations. [[Cinema of Korea|Korean cinema]] also began to develop and Korean musicians began performing to wider audiences.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nWhen [[Beatlemania]] reached the shores of Korea the first local rock bands appeared, the first of which is said to be [[Add 4|Add4]], a band founded in 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychemusic.org/Add4.html|title=ADD4 & KOREAN PSYCH-ROCK & FOLK-POP reissues : ADD 4|publisher=psychemusic.org|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref> The first talent contest for rock bands in Seoul was organized in 1968.\n\nSome Korean singers gained international popularity.

In the mid-1960s, due to the influence of the legendary British group [[The Beatles]], there was a rise of \"group sound\" in South Korea, for example, Add4 and the {{ill|Key Boys|ko|\ud0a4\ubcf4\uc774\uc2a4}}.&nbsp; Add4, Korea's first rock group, was formed by Shin Joong-hyun in 1962 and produced Korea's first rock song, \"The Woman in the Rain\", which is a form of light rock reminiscent of the early Beatles. Shin Joong-hyun was so instrumental in the development of Korean rock music that he is regarded as the \"godfather of Korean rock\" in South Korea.\n\nDuring this period, with the rise of Western pop music and Korean rock music, trot was no longer predominant in South Korea. However, trot singers like [[Lee Mi-ja]] still managed to attract a certain level of popularity, with famous songs like \"Camellia Lady\" ({{lang-ko|\"\ub3d9\ubc31 \uc544\uac00\uc528\"}}).\n\nDuring the 1950s and 60s, Western pop music, Korean rock music, and trot co-existed in South Korea.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n=== Late 1960s and 1970s: Hippie and folk influences ===\nAt the end of the 1960s Korean pop music underwent another transformation. More and more musicians were university students and graduates who were heavily influenced by American culture and lifestyle (including the [[hippie]] movement of the 1960s) and made lighthearted music unlike their predecessors, who were influenced by war and Japanese oppression.<ref name=\"encykorea3\"/> The younger generation opposed the [[Vietnam War]] as much as American hippies did, which resulted in the Korean government banning songs with more liberal lyrics. In spite of this, folk-influenced pop remained popular among the youth, and local television channel [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] organised a music contest for university students in 1977. This was the foundation of several modern music festivals.<ref name=\"newforce54-572\">''K-Pop: A New Force in Pop Music'', pp. 54\u201357</ref> The younger generation born after the 1950s had grown up under the U.S. influence and preferred the U.S. lifestyle, giving rise to the \"youth culture\" which was expressed through long hair, jeans, acoustic guitars and folk music. &nbsp;The folk music of that time is made up of melodies sung plainly, with the singing accompanied by a guitar or two. A majority of the folk music at that time was initiated by elite university students and those who graduated from prestigious schools. Like the activists of the U.S. student movement, they turned to folk music as the preferred music of politicized youth, who staged demonstrations against the authoritarian government. &nbsp;In turn, the government banned folk music due to its association with the students' anti-government movements. In the 1970s, the [[Park Chung-hee]] government banned American pop music and Korean rock music for their association with sex and drugs. Shin Joong-hyun, the \"godfather of Korean rock music\", was imprisoned in 1975 due to a marijuana scandal. &nbsp;In order to bolster its anti-Japanese credentials, the government also banned trot songs because of its \"Japaneseness\" given the influence of Japanese enka songs on trot. However, President Park actually embraced trot.\n\nOne of the leading figures of the era was [[Han Dae-soo]], who was raised in the United States and influenced by [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]] and [[John Lennon]]. Han's song \"Mul jom juso\" (\ubb3c \uc880 \uc8fc\uc18c, Give Me Water) became iconic among young people in Korea. His daring performances and unique singing style often shocked the public and later he was banned from performing in Korea. Han moved to [[New York City]] and pursued his musical career there, only returning to his home country in the 1990s.<ref name=\"newforce54-572\" /> Other notable singers of the period include [[Song Chang-sik]], [[Cho Young-nam]] and [[Yang Hee-eun]].<ref name=\":11\"/>{{failed verification|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn the 1970s, [[DJ]]s also started to become popular.<ref name=\"encykorea3\" />\n\n===1980s: The era of ballads===\n{{Main|Korean ballad}}\nThe 1980s saw the rise of [[Pop ballad|ballad]] singers after {{ill|Lee Gwang-jo|ko|\uc774\uad11\uc870 (\uac00\uc218)}}'s 1985 album \"You\u2019re Too Far Away to Get Close to\" (\uac00\uae4c\uc774 \ud558\uae30\uc5d4 \ub108\ubb34 \uba3c \ub2f9\uc2e0, Gakkai Hagien Neomu Meon Dangsin) sold more than 300,000 copies. Other popular ballad singers included [[Lee Moon-se]] (\uc774\ubb38\uc138) and [[Byun Jin-sub]] (\ubcc0\uc9c4\uc12d), nicknamed the \"Prince of Ballads\". One of the most sought-after ballad composers of the era was [[Lee Young-hoon (composer)|Lee Young-hoon]] (\uc774\uc601\ud6c8), whose songs were compiled into a modern musical in 2011 titled ''Gwanghwamun Yeonga'' (\uad11\ud654\ubb38 \uc5f0\uac00, Gwanghwamun's Song).<ref name=\"newforce60-612\">''K-Pop: A New Force in Pop Music'', pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\nThe Asia Music Forum was launched in 1980, with representatives from five different Asian countries competing in the event.

His first album ''Chang bakkui yeoja'' (\ucc3d \ubc16\uc758 \uc5ec\uc790, Woman outside the window) was a hit and he became the first Korean singer to take to the stage at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York. Cho's musical repertoire included rock, dance, trot and folk-pop.<ref name=\"newforce60-612\" /> Despite his early association with rock music as an electric guitarist in a rock band, Cho Yong-pil's initial popularity came from his trot songs which were popular in both South Korea and Japan. For example, in 1976, his trot song, \u201cPlease Return to Pusan Port\u201d was a great hit.&nbsp;Despite the temporary setback due to his involvement in a marijuana incident in 1977, he managed to bounce back with the song \"The Woman Outside the Window\" which reached a record-breaking sales of 1 million in 1980.&nbsp; In 1988, he sang \"Seoul Seoul Seoul\" in three languages (Korean, English and Japanese) to celebrate the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n===1990s: Development of modern K-pop===\n[[File:DJ DOC @ Cyworld Dream Music Festival \uc2f8\uc774\uc6d4\ub4dc \ub4dc\ub9bc \ubba4\uc9c1 \ud398\uc2a4\ud2f0\ubc8c 36.jpg|thumb|alt=Three men performing on stage with upraised arms, wearing matching neon-orange shorts and polo shirts|[[DJ DOC]], one of the popular hip hop trios of the 1990s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rki.kbs.co.kr/english/program/program_artist_detail.htm?No=10198|title=DJ DOC|publisher=KBS World|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>]]\nIn the 1990s, Korean pop musicians incorporated partially [[Europop]] and mostly [[American popular music]] styles such as [[hip hop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], and [[electronic dance]] in their music.<ref name=\"Hartong 20062\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/musicaltermsworl0000hart|url-access=registration|title=Musical terms worldwide: a companion for the musical explorer|last=Hartong|first=Jan Laurens|publisher=Semar Publishers|year=2006|isbn=978-88-7778-090-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/musicaltermsworl0000hart/page/15 15]|quote=Since the 1990s, popular genres like rap, rock and techno house have been incorporated into Korean popular music... which often emulates American models.}}</ref> In 1992 the emergence of [[Seo Taiji & Boys]] marked a revolutionary moment in the history of K-pop.

Moreover, agencies were able to terminate a trainee contract at any time for any reason.

In April 2018, in preparation and out of respect for the meeting between North leader Kim Jong Un and South leader, Moon Jae In, the South Korean speakers ceased their broadcasts.

Singers need to use English since the companies want to occupy markets in the other parts of Asia, which enables them to open the Western market in the end. Most of the K-pop singers learn English because it is a common language in the world of music, but some singers also learn other foreign languages such as Japanese to approach the Japanese market.<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\"/> Similarly, increasing numbers of K-pop bands use English names rather than Korean ones. This allows songs and artists to be marketed to a wider audience around the world.<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\" />\n\n<!--I think the source for this is describing J-pop--><!--East Asia has many different languages, which makes recording in English a working choice to make up the language gap that disturbs the international music communication. Nonetheless, probably because singers do not want to take the risk of presenting a wrong identity, this option is certainly not used most commonly. Musicians who understand both cultures and are fluent English speakers such as [[Tata Young]] and [[Utada Hikaru]] have the most success while using this method to have international music markets. The reason why the frequency of the strategy is comparatively low is because not many East Asian artists have fluent English skills, which people often make comments about a singer's English fluency. More importantly, the East Asian music wave is not simply about the sounds and products of music. Flows of language and identity come with the East Asian wave, and more of these flows will enable researchers to have a better understanding of the international flow in East Asian music.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=Phil|date=January 2013|title=English and identity in East Asian popular music|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/popular-music/article/english-and-identity-in-east-asian-popular-music/89BC456C9A2FEA66D58DC36FD613FB3B|journal=Popular Music|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=23\u201333|doi=10.1017/S0261143012000529|issn=0261-1430}}</ref>\n-->\nHowever, the use of English has not guaranteed the popularity of K-pop in the North American market. For some commentators, the reason for this is because the genre can be seen as a distilled version of Western music, making it difficult for K-pop to find acceptance in these markets.<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\" /> Furthermore, Western audiences tend to place emphasis on authenticity and individual expression in music, which the idol system can be seen as suppressing.<ref name=\"Chosun Ilbo\"/> \nAccording to Elaine W. Chun's research, even though [[hybridity]] appears more and more often in K-pop, and sometimes may even make fans admire K-pop stars more because it is fresh, new and interesting, it is hard to change those who believe in a perfect ideal for pure linguistic. This means that the original form of language is still difficult to alter.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chun|first=Elaine W.|date=February 2017|title=How to drop a name: Hybridity, purity, and the K-pop fan|journal=Language in Society|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=57\u201376|doi=10.1017/S0047404516000828|issn=0047-4045}}</ref>\n\nArtist names, song titles, and lyrics have exhibited a significant growth in the usage of English words. No singers in the top fifty charts in 1990 had English in their names: people who worked in the Korean music industry viewed using Korean names as standard. In 1995, most popular singers such as [[Kim Gun-mo]], Park Mi-kyung, [[Park Jin-young]], [[Lee Seung-chul]], and [[Byun Jin-sub]] still used Korean names, but fourteen of the singers and groups in the top fifty used English names, including [[DJ DOC]], [[015B]], Piano, and [[Solid (band)|Solid]]. After the 1997 financial crisis, the government stopped censoring English lyrics and Korea started to have a boom in English. Since the late 1990s, English usage in singers' names, song titles, and lyrics has grown quickly. Seventeen singers in the top fifty charts used English names in 2000, and thirty-one did so in 2005. In 2010, forty-one  singers used English names among the top fifty songs, but usually three or four singers and groups had more than one or two songs on the chart simultaneously. Korean names (e.g. [[Baek Ji-young]], [[Seo In-young]], and [[Huh Gak]]) are seen less frequently, and many K-pop singers have English names (e.g. [[IU (singer)|IU]], [[Sistar]], [[T-ara]], [[GD & TOP]], [[Beast (South Korean band)|Beast]], and [[After School (band)|After School]]). Notably, until the early 1990s, musicians with English names would [[transliterate]] them into [[hangul]], but now singers would use English names written with the [[Latin script|roman alphabet]].<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\"/> In 1995, the percentage of song titles using English in the top 50 charts was 8%. This fluctuated between 30% in 2000, 18% in 2005, and 44% in 2010. An example of a Korean song with a large proportion of English lyrics is [[Kara (South Korean band)|Kara]]'s \"[[Jumping (Kara song)|Jumping]],\" which was released at the same time in both Korea and Japan to much success.<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\" />\n\n====Criticism of hybrid identity====\nThere have been critical responses in South Korea regarding the identity of the genre since its ascendance. Some of the notable music critics in the region have criticized K-pop as \"a industrial label mainly designed to promote the national brand in the global market from the beginning\" and argued that it was \"not formed spontaneously as a pop culture but created with the orchestrated plan led by the government with commercial considerations\" although in fact \"the genre has practically no ties with traditional Korean identity\". There's also a perspective that the name of the genre was derived from [[J-pop]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://h21.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/culture_general/29888.html|title=[\ub808\ub4dc \uae30\ud68d]\ucf00\uc774\ud31d, \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud574|website=h21.hani.co.kr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://ch.yes24.com/Article/View/24536|title=\uac00\uc694, \ucf00\uc774\ud31d \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub108\uba38|last=Shin|first=Hyun-joon}}</ref>\n\nK-Pop has at times faced criticisms from journalists who perceive the music to be formulaic and unoriginal.<ref name=\"fast music2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2012/02/123_100092.html|title=K-pop grows on disposable 'fast music'|date=April 12, 2011|work=The Korea Times|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/725161/kpop-feature/|title=Hallyu, K-pop!

These songs were called ''changga'' in Korean, and they were typically based on a popular Western melody sung with Korean lyrics. For example, the song \"Oh My Darling, Clementine\" became known as \"Simcheongga.\"<ref group=\"note\">Not to be confused with the [[pansori]] story [[Simcheongga|of the same name]].</ref> During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] (1910\u20131945) the popularity of ''changga'' songs rose as Koreans expressed their feelings against Japanese oppression through music. One of the most popular songs was \"Huimangga\" (\ud76c\ub9dd\uac00, The Song of Hope). The Japanese confiscated the existing ''changga'' collections and published lyrics books of their own.<ref name=\"newforce47-492\">''K-Pop: A New Force in Pop Music'', pp. 47\u201379</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe first known Korean pop album was \"Yi Pungjin Sewol\" (This Tumultuous Time), by Park Chae-seon and Lee Ryu-saek in 1925, which contained popular songs translated from Japanese. The first pop song written by a Korean composer is thought to be \"Nakhwayusu\" (\ub099\ud654\uc720\uc218, Fallen Blossoms on Running Water) sung by Lee Jeong-suk in 1929.<ref name=\"newforce47-492\" /> In the mid-1920s, Japanese composer [[Masao Koga]] mixed traditional Korean music with Gospel music that American Evangelists introduced in the 1870s. This type of music became known as [[Enka]] in Japan, and later in Korea developed into [[Trot (music)|Trot]] ({{lang-ko|\"\ud2b8\ub85c\ud2b8\"}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jpnews.kr/sub_read.html?uid=8082&section=sc1&section2=%C0%CE%B9%B0|title=JPNews \uc77c\ubcf8\uc774 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4! \uc77c\ubcf8\ub274\uc2a4\ud3ec\ud138!|publisher=Jpnews.kr|accessdate=January 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=\uace0\uac00\ub9c8\uc0ac\uc624|encyclopedia=Doosan Encyclopedia|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?cid=200000000&docId=1164528&mobile&categoryId=200001546|accessdate=January 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===1940s\u20131960s: Arrival of Western culture===\n[[File:Marilyn Monroe.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Marilyn Monroe poses as a crowd of soldiers photograph her|[[Marilyn Monroe]] entertaining American soldiers in Korea in 1954]]\nAfter the [[Korean Peninsula]] was partitioned into North and South following its liberation in 1945 from [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]], [[Western culture]] was introduced into South Korea on a small scale, with a few Western-styled bars and clubs playing Western music. After the [[Korean War]] (1950\u201353) U.S. troops remained in South Korea, causing American and world culture to spread in South Korea and Western music to gradually become more accepted.

Since South Korea was impoverished after the Korean War, skilled Korean singers regarded performing for the U.S. troops as a good means to earn money. Many singers sang for the American troops, usually in dedicated clubs, the number of which rose to 264. They performed various genres like country music, blues, jazz and rock & roll. The [[Economy of South Korea|South Korean economy]] started blooming and popular music followed the trend, spread by the first commercial radio stations. [[Cinema of Korea|Korean cinema]] also began to develop and Korean musicians began performing to wider audiences.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nWhen [[Beatlemania]] reached the shores of Korea the first local rock bands appeared, the first of which is said to be [[Add 4|Add4]], a band founded in 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychemusic.org/Add4.html|title=ADD4 & KOREAN PSYCH-ROCK & FOLK-POP reissues : ADD 4|publisher=psychemusic.org|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref> The first talent contest for rock bands in Seoul was organized in 1968.\n\nSome Korean singers gained international popularity. In 1959, [[the Kim Sisters]] went to Las Vegas and became the first Korean artist to release an album in the U.S. pop market. Their cover of \"Charlie Brown\" reached No.7 on the Billboard Single Chart. The Kim Sisters also appeared on TV programs and radio programs and held tours in the U.S. and Europe.

In the mid-1960s, due to the influence of the legendary British group [[The Beatles]], there was a rise of \"group sound\" in South Korea, for example, Add4 and the {{ill|Key Boys|ko|\ud0a4\ubcf4\uc774\uc2a4}}.&nbsp; Add4, Korea's first rock group, was formed by Shin Joong-hyun in 1962 and produced Korea's first rock song, \"The Woman in the Rain\", which is a form of light rock reminiscent of the early Beatles. Shin Joong-hyun was so instrumental in the development of Korean rock music that he is regarded as the \"godfather of Korean rock\" in South Korea.\n\nDuring this period, with the rise of Western pop music and Korean rock music, trot was no longer predominant in South Korea. However, trot singers like [[Lee Mi-ja]] still managed to attract a certain level of popularity, with famous songs like \"Camellia Lady\" ({{lang-ko|\"\ub3d9\ubc31 \uc544\uac00\uc528\"}}).\n\nDuring the 1950s and 60s, Western pop music, Korean rock music, and trot co-existed in South Korea.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n=== Late 1960s and 1970s: Hippie and folk influences ===\nAt the end of the 1960s Korean pop music underwent another transformation. More and more musicians were university students and graduates who were heavily influenced by American culture and lifestyle (including the [[hippie]] movement of the 1960s) and made lighthearted music unlike their predecessors, who were influenced by war and Japanese oppression.<ref name=\"encykorea3\"/> The younger generation opposed the [[Vietnam War]] as much as American hippies did, which resulted in the Korean government banning songs with more liberal lyrics. In spite of this, folk-influenced pop remained popular among the youth, and local television channel [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] organised a music contest for university students in 1977. This was the foundation of several modern music festivals.<ref name=\"newforce54-572\">''K-Pop: A New Force in Pop Music'', pp. 54\u201357</ref> The younger generation born after the 1950s had grown up under the U.S. influence and preferred the U.S. lifestyle, giving rise to the \"youth culture\" which was expressed through long hair, jeans, acoustic guitars and folk music. &nbsp;The folk music of that time is made up of melodies sung plainly, with the singing accompanied by a guitar or two. A majority of the folk music at that time was initiated by elite university students and those who graduated from prestigious schools. Like the activists of the U.S. student movement, they turned to folk music as the preferred music of politicized youth, who staged demonstrations against the authoritarian government. &nbsp;In turn, the government banned folk music due to its association with the students' anti-government movements. In the 1970s, the [[Park Chung-hee]] government banned American pop music and Korean rock music for their association with sex and drugs. Shin Joong-hyun, the \"godfather of Korean rock music\", was imprisoned in 1975 due to a marijuana scandal. &nbsp;In order to bolster its anti-Japanese credentials, the government also banned trot songs because of its \"Japaneseness\" given the influence of Japanese enka songs on trot. However, President Park actually embraced trot.\n\nOne of the leading figures of the era was [[Han Dae-soo]], who was raised in the United States and influenced by [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]] and [[John Lennon]]. Han's song \"Mul jom juso\" (\ubb3c \uc880 \uc8fc\uc18c, Give Me Water) became iconic among young people in Korea. His daring performances and unique singing style often shocked the public and later he was banned from performing in Korea. Han moved to [[New York City]] and pursued his musical career there, only returning to his home country in the 1990s.<ref name=\"newforce54-572\" /> Other notable singers of the period include [[Song Chang-sik]], [[Cho Young-nam]] and [[Yang Hee-eun]].<ref name=\":11\"/>{{failed verification|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn the 1970s, [[DJ]]s also started to become popular.<ref name=\"encykorea3\" />\n\n===1980s: The era of ballads===\n{{Main|Korean ballad}}\nThe 1980s saw the rise of [[Pop ballad|ballad]] singers after {{ill|Lee Gwang-jo|ko|\uc774\uad11\uc870 (\uac00\uc218)}}'s 1985 album \"You\u2019re Too Far Away to Get Close to\" (\uac00\uae4c\uc774 \ud558\uae30\uc5d4 \ub108\ubb34 \uba3c \ub2f9\uc2e0, Gakkai Hagien Neomu Meon Dangsin) sold more than 300,000 copies. Other popular ballad singers included [[Lee Moon-se]] (\uc774\ubb38\uc138) and [[Byun Jin-sub]] (\ubcc0\uc9c4\uc12d), nicknamed the \"Prince of Ballads\". One of the most sought-after ballad composers of the era was [[Lee Young-hoon (composer)|Lee Young-hoon]] (\uc774\uc601\ud6c8), whose songs were compiled into a modern musical in 2011 titled ''Gwanghwamun Yeonga'' (\uad11\ud654\ubb38 \uc5f0\uac00, Gwanghwamun's Song).<ref name=\"newforce60-612\">''K-Pop: A New Force in Pop Music'', pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\nThe Asia Music Forum was launched in 1980, with representatives from five different Asian countries competing in the event.

His first album ''Chang bakkui yeoja'' (\ucc3d \ubc16\uc758 \uc5ec\uc790, Woman outside the window) was a hit and he became the first Korean singer to take to the stage at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York.

Prior to these regulations, trainee idols at eight idol agencies were not permitted to seek contracts at any other agency while at training. Moreover, agencies were able to terminate a trainee contract at any time for any reason. The Fair Trade Commission states that they believe these changes will \"result in a more just contract culture within the entertainment industry between trainee and agency.\" For now these regulations only apply to eight major idol agencies but the Ministry of Culture intends to apply these regulations to all existing agencies throughout 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.koreaboo.com/longform/new-contractual-changes-cause-concern-within-music-industry|title=New contractual changes cause concern within music industry|last=|first=|date=March 9, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSome of the concerns raised by the idol agencies over these regulations include the risk of a trainee at one agency going undercover at another agency to receive training with the other agency.

Flash drives that used to cost upwards of US$50, can now be purchased for under $10, making them more affordable and easier to send into North Korea.<ref name=\":06\" /> The content on these USB drives and SD cards are then viewed by plugging the device into a [[notel]], a small portable media player.<ref name=\":03\" /> Although this practice had originally begun with banned books and simple radios, there is now an even higher demand for South Korean media following the cultural phenomena of [[hallyu]], or the Korean Wave.\n\nThose near the border who choose to stay away from the banned media from the flash drives often cannot escape it. Ever since the 1950s, both countries have blasted their own propaganda across the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]]: North Korea broadcasting anti-south propaganda and South Korea broadcasting Korean and world news as well as K-pop.<ref name=\":14\" /> In 2004, both countries agreed to end the broadcasts. After an incident in 2015, South Korea resumed broadcasting anti-North news for four days, as well as in 2016, after North Korea tested its hydrogen bomb and has been broadcasting since. In April 2018, in preparation and out of respect for the meeting between North leader Kim Jong Un and South leader, Moon Jae In, the South Korean speakers ceased their broadcasts. These 11 loudspeakers can be heard up to six miles into North Korean territory. This enables the broadcasts to influence possible defectors staying near the border as well as create bothersome propaganda that North Korean soldiers cannot escape.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nThe dissemination of K-pop and Korean media has been crucial in presenting the realities of North Korea to its citizens. By detailing the basic conditions of life in South Korea and introducing foreign ideologies, Korean media has aroused civil unrest amongst both citizens and elites concerning the disparities between living conditions inside and outside North Korea.<ref name=\":03\" /> A defector explains that, when he escaped in 2012, only the wealthy families were the ones consuming the South Korean media because the costs of the flash drives and technology to use them were so high. Because most youth lacked the resources to afford the drives, most consumers of South Korean media before 2012 were middle-aged elite who favored K-dramas over K-pop due to their more traditional behavior.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2015/06/do-north-koreans-like-k-pop/|title=Do North Koreans like K-pop? {{!}} NK News - North Korea News|last=Lee|first=Je Son|date=June 17, 2015|work=NK News - North Korea News|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}</ref> The current high demand for Korean media continues to rise as now approximately 70% of North Koreans consume foreign media in their homes,<ref name=\":03\" /> which accounts for the higher youth following of South Korean media today. One researcher at the [[Korea Institute for National Unification]] claims to have never met a single defector who had not seen or listened to foreign media before entering South Korea. Yet experts remain wary that a cultural uprising will occur because of the media. Consuming South Korean media serves many purposes for North Koreans such as enjoyment and education, but few consider uprooting a totalitarian regime because of the cultures they've experienced through K-pop and K-dramas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Mikyoung|date=August 1, 2018|title=North Korea's Hidden Revolution: How the Information Underground Is Transforming a Closed Society.

This changed in the early 2000s as the cultural dispersion of ''Hallyu'' has contributed to the reconstruction of South Korea's image among the Taiwanese. This change was in part prompted by the South Korean government, who wished to encourage goodwill between the two countries after the break of diplomacy.

An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the whole foundation for Varick to institute the [[Law of New York]], the [[New York City Administrative Code]], and the [[Rules of New York City]] during his terms as mayor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>.

Varick's body of work from this era would lead to the ''Varick Transcripts'' which now live in the [[Library of Congress]]. The value of these documents has been noted throughout their lifetime as invaluable to the understanding of the formation of the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nVarick was a founder of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and the [[American Bible Society]].

Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641).\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]].

In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]].

Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government.

The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the whole foundation for the [[Law of New York]], the [[New York City Administrative Code]], and the [[Rules of New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nConcurrently to the above, he was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from [[Manhattan|New York County]] from 1786 to 1788. During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Philanthropy & Charity==\n===American Bible Society===\nVarick was a founder of the [[American Bible Society]] in 1816.<ref name=\"sunypress\">{{cite web|title=Richard Varick: A Forgotten Founding Father|url=https://www.sunypress.edu/p-5293-richard-varick-a-forgotten-foun.aspx|website=www.sunypress.edu|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Wosh1994\">{{cite book|last1=Wosh|first1=Peter J.|title=Spreading the Word: The Bible Business in Nineteenth-century America|date=1994|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=0801429285|url=https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh/page/16 16]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> He would later become president (succeeding [[John Jay]]) in 1828 until his death in 1831.\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\nHe was an original member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] beginning in 1783, and president of the New York chapter until his death.

The club currently fields teams in the majority of the age groups from Under 6s through to seniors, and also Girls' Tag teams. The club plays its home games at Fregon Reserve in [[Clayton, Victoria]].\n\n==History==\nThe club was founded in 1976 as the \"Waverley Rugby Club\" by a group of mutual friends and a group of dedicated players. The origin of the name came from the club being established in what was then the \"City of Waverley\". Following the establishment of the club, the club's first home ground was found in the [[Glen Waverley]] area of [[Melbourne]], Larpent Reserve.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://websites.sportstg.com/club_info.cgi?c=1-2121-24902-0-13020790&sID=27531|title=Waverley Oakleigh Panthers History|website=WAVERLEY OAKLEIGH PANTHERS RLC|date=3 June 2017|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> The club's nickname to begin with was the Kangaroos and the first playing strip also resembled the national team's colours.\n\nIn the first few years after establishment the club was retitled \"Waverley Rugby League Club\" to better differentiate the club from other rugby union clubs.\n\nThe first year was a good one for the newly formed club, which reached fourth position in the [[Victorian Rugby League]] competition, playing against well established and strong clubs. The club's ambitions for its first year had been realised, it was now up and running, and was celebrated with the club's first presentation of trophies to players held at [[Jells Park]] in an old Tram. Only five years after establishment, the Waverley Rugby League Club won its maiden premiership in 1980.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=7-2121-0-0-0&sID=387727</ref>\n\nIn 1990, the club relocated to [[Clayton, Victoria|Clayton]], in what was then the City of Oakleigh. At the same time the [[VRL]] directed all clubs to adopt the colours and monikers of existing [[NSWRL]] teams. The club chose the [[Penrith Panthers]]' name and colours, and from then on was known as the Waverley Oakleigh Panthers Rugby League club.

The club currently fields teams in the majority of the age groups from Under 6s through to seniors, and also Girls' Tag teams.

The origin of the name came from the club being established in what was then the \"City of Waverley\". Following the establishment of the club, the club's first home ground was found in the [[Glen Waverley]] area of [[Melbourne]], Larpent Reserve.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://websites.sportstg.com/club_info.cgi?c=1-2121-24902-0-13020790&sID=27531|title=Waverley Oakleigh Panthers History|website=WAVERLEY OAKLEIGH PANTHERS RLC|date=3 June 2017|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> The clubs nickname to begin with was the Kangaroos and the first playing strip also resembled the national teams colours.\n\nIn the first few years after establishment the club was retitled \"Waverley Rugby League Club\" to better differentiate the club from other rugby union clubs.\n\nThe first year was a good one for the newly formed club, which reached fourth position in the [[Victorian Rugby League]] competition, playing against well established and strong clubs. The club's ambitions for its first year had been realised, it was now up and running, and was celebrated with the club's first presentation of trophies to players held at [[Jells Park]] in an old Tram. Only five years after establishment, the Waverley Rugby League Club won its maiden premiership in 1980.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=7-2121-0-0-0&sID=387727</ref>\n\nIn 1990, the club relocated to [[Clayton, Victoria|Clayton]], in what was then the City of Oakleigh. At the same time the [[VRL]] directed all clubs to adopt the colours and monikers of existing [[NSWRL]] teams. The club chose the [[Penrith Panthers]]' name and colours, and from then on was known as the Waverley Oakleigh Panthers Rugby League club.
