His writings, tenure in parliament, and other political activities were often greatly at odds with the Uzbek government. He was arrested but escaped into exile for many years. In 2005 he was instrumental in forming the democratic opposition group [[Congress of Democratic Uzbekistan]] (CDU) and became its first chairman. His writings are still banned in Uzbekistan.\n\n==During the Soviet era==\nMamatov was born on September 1, 1955, in [[Samarqand Region]], married in 1980, and has four children. He was educated in Samarqand and at the Department of Journalism of [[Tashkent State University]] from 1973 to 1979, where he did research in journalism and linguistics until 1981.  He began his journalism career with the ''Toshkent Haqiqati'' newspaper in 1973, moving the next year to the newspaper ''Qishloq Haqiqati'', where he stayed until 1979.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1981, Mamatov was an editor at the State TV-Radio Company. He then worked for the ''[[Lenin]] Yoli'' newspaper in Samarqand Province from 1982 to 1985.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1990 he was a correspondent for ''O\u2019zbekiston Ovozi'' in Samarqand Province and ''Qishloq Haqiqati'', where he had worked from 1974 to 1979. He also became a columnist for the satirical magazine ''Mushtum''. During these years more than a thousand of his satirical, critical, and political analysis articles were published. Some of his articles were collected in the books ''Youth'', ''Pure Dawn'', and ''525 Days that Shook Samarkand''.\n\nIn 1990, at the age of 35, Mamatov received the title \"Honored Journalist of Uzbekistan\".

During this period, he wrote the book ''Press Law'' and founded the newspaper ''Xalq So\u2019zi'', the main publication of the Uzbek Parliament.\n\n==Uzbek independence==\nOn June 20, 1990, the Supreme Soviet issued Uzbekistan's Declaration of Independence. Mamatov was one of the authors of this historic document.\n\nMamatov organized a parliamentary commission to investigate violent incidents in Bekobod, Boka, Parkent and concluded that they were masterminded by the Uzbek government. He showed evidence that the [[KGB]] was behind terrorist acts among the ethnic Uzbeks and [[Meskhetian Turks]] in the Parkent district of [[Tashkent Province]]. His public conclusions and accusations angered the Uzbek government, which followed and harassed him. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan accused Mamatov of criticizing the Chairman of the Party, [[Islam Karimov]]. The chief justice of the Supreme Court, on his own TV program, asked the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet for permission to arrest Mamatov, but the attempt was rejected for lack of parliamentary support.\n\nOn August 17, 1991, to protest the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt]] in Moscow opposing [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reform program and the [[Union of Sovereign States|new union treaty]] for decentralizing Soviet power and returning it to the republics, Mamatov joined some of his colleagues in a demonstration in front of the Parliament building and publicly burned his [[Communist Party]] membership certificate. He later stood for election as chairman of the [[Uzbek Journalists Association]] and claimed that the government falsified the election results.\n\nPresident Islam Karimov and his allies in parliament shut down the Glasnost Committee, but once Mamatov resigned, the committee was re-instated.\n\nIn 1991, in the seventh session of the Uzbek Parliament, Mamatov and some of his fellow deputies put forward measures in Parliament to limit Karimov's attempts to become an absolute dictator. Under pressure from democratic deputies, the Uzbek government had to permit the organization of a committee to regulate relations between the president of Uzbekistan and the parliament. Mamatov became the Presidential Advisor for Parliamentary Relations in that committee and was subsequently appointed as a Chief of Uzbek State Television-Deputy of the State Radio and Television Committee.\n\n==In opposition==\nAs a result of the Karimov administration's attacks on human rights and democracy, including the bloody events in Tashkent City's Student Town, in 1992 Mamatov felt compelled to resign his position in protest. Before his resignation, Mamatov declared that dictatorship was reigning in Uzbekistan. It was the first time a high government official openly declared that his resignation was a sign of protest against Karimov.\n\nIn parliament, Mamatov continued to lead a group of opposition representatives who strongly and openly criticized the emerging dictatorship under Karimov's rule and persisted in fighting for democracy. Mamatov quickly emerged as a leader among the most prominent critics of Karimov regime's state policy. He was one of the organizers of the March 28, 1992, Uzbek Democratic Coalition Forum, which took place at the [[Erk/Liberty Democratic Party]] headquarters.\n\nAfter that, Mamatov led the [[non-governmental organization]] Turon, a language research organization. Even though only the Supreme Court of Uzbekistan had the power to shut down Turon, the Ministry of Justice, violating the law, abolished Turon and confiscated all its papers, assets, and other possessions.\n\nOn February 7, 1993, the Uzbek government banned ''Erk'' (Liberty), the newspaper affiliated with the Erk/Liberty Democratic Party, the main party of the democratic political opposition.  At that time, Mamatov was a chief editor of the paper as well as deputy chairman of the party. On February 13, Uzbek police forcibly evicted Mamatov and his family from their house in Tashkent. The government seized the house, forcing Mamatov to move to his hometown, Samarqand City. He was charged with criticizing President Karimov while in parliament for his dictatorial behavior. On April 17, the Uzbek authorities arrested Mamatov in Samarqand.\n\nHe later wrote the book ''Palace Games'' about Karimov's actions. Even though the government confiscated the manuscript, the [[samizdat]] became very popular. In 1994 the Erk/Liberty Democratic Party serialized the book in ''Erk''.\n\n==In exile==\nWith the help of supporters Mamatov was able to escape Uzbekistan. His wife, the mother of four children, was pressured to divorce him but refused to do so. She was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nAfter securing his family's release and emigration from Uzbekistan, Mamatov moved to [[Turkey]]. From 1994 to 1998 he worked at [[Ko\u00e7 University]] in [[Istanbul]], as a correspondent of the [[BBC]] Uzbek Service, and as a columnist for the newspaper ''Turkiye''. While living abroad he wrote his book ''Quvg\u2019in'' (''Exile'', a trilogy), which was critical of Uzbekistan's tyrannical regime.\n\nThe Uzbek government sent secret agents three times to kill Mamatov, which led to his being granted political asylum in the United States through the [[United Nations]] in February 1998.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\nMamatov resumed his career as a journalist in the [[Voice of America|VOA]] Uzbek Service, US from 1999 to 2004. Due to his critical reports the Uzbek government ordered the arrest of his relatives, including his sisters. With pressure from the U.S. Congress, U.S. government, and international human rights organizations, Mamatov's relatives were released.\n\nIn 2005 Mamatov brought together leaders of the Uzbek democratic opposition, which had been unable to effectively coordinate activities over the previous 15 years. A [[Congress of Democratic Uzbekistan]] (CDU), open to all opposition groups and individuals, convened on September 25, 2005. Mamatov served as its chairman until 2011.\n\nMamatov also taught Uzbek in language schools and since 2001 has been working as a senior linguist at the Language Research Center (LRC).\n\n==Books==\nJahangir Mamatov is the author of nearly 40 books. Many of his books were published in the United States, Turkey, and [[Azerbaijan]], yet his books are strictly forbidden in Uzbekistan. He is the author of six linguistic books which were all published in the United States.\n\nHe has been publishing his personal website, [http://jahonnoma.com/ '''Jahonnoma.com'''], and the CDU website, [http://turonzamin.org '''TuronZamin.org'''], since 2001.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.jahonnoma.com}}\n* [http://uzbekcongress.wordpress.com/2010/01/ turonzamin]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mamatov, Jahangir}}\n[[Category:1955 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Uzbekistani journalists]]\n[[Category:Uzbekistani writers]]\n[[Category:Uzbekistani politicians]]\n[[Category:National University of Uzbekistan alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox officeholder\n| name = Jahongir Mamatov\n| image = [[File:Jahongir Mamatov.jpg|thumb|]]\n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|1955|9|1|df=y}}\n| birth_place = [[Samarkand Region]], [[Uzbek SSR]], [[Soviet Union]] {{small|(now [[Uzbekistan]])}}\n| death_date = \n| death_place = \n| children = 4\n| education = [[Tashkent State University]]\n| website = https://jahonnoma.com\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n'''Jahangir Mamatov''' ({{lang-ru|\u0414\u0436\u0430\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0438\u0440 \u041c\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432}}) is a linguist, lexicographer, author, journalist, and a political analyst of Central Asian issues.

The Town of Prosper is located within the [[Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 9,423;<ref name=\"Census 2010 population\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US4859696| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Census Summary File 1 (G001): Prosper town, Texas| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=August 3, 2015| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213052144/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US4859696| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}</ref> As of 2019, the estimated population was 28,039.\n\n==History==\nThe first settlers arrived in 1846 to farm cotton in the black fertile prairie soil.  Between 1850 and 1902, two settlements existed - Rock Hill was two miles south of the present town and Richland was one mile north.  The development of these small communities was expedited in 1876 when County Courts ordered small tracts of land to be established for quick sale.  These tracts, each about 160 acres in size, were sold for $3.50 per acre.  Dr. A. T. Bryant of McKinney purchased what later became the center of the present town.\n\nThe towns merged during the establishment of the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad in March 1902.  For years, Prosper was the central stop for the railroad between Dallas and Sherman.  When community officials applied for a post office with the name \"Richland\", they were informed that city name was already taken.  Postmaster B.J. Naugle asked for an alternative name and J.C. Slaughter suggested the name \"Prosper\", because crops that year had been very prosperous.\n\nThe Town of Prosper was incorporated in 1914 with a commission form of government and a population of 500.  U.N. Clary was mayor and served in that position for the next 49 years.\n[[Prosper High School]] cost $113.5 million to construct and is 590,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>, complete with a medical tech lab, a restaurant-worthy kitchen, a greenhouse, a broadcast studio, and an indoor football practice facility.\n\nThe Town of Prosper holds an annual Christmas festival and Fourth of July event.  Each May, Prosper Founders Fest celebrates its history, people, and arts.  The event combines the Prosper Fire Department's IBCA-sanctioned Barbecue Cookoff, a 5K race, an art show and music festival, and a Sunday Family Fellowship.\n\nProsper is a growing area with many new homes and communities being developed.

The Town of Prosper is located within the [[Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 9,423;<ref name=\"Census 2010 population\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US4859696| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Census Summary File 1 (G001): Prosper town, Texas| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=August 3, 2015| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213052144/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US4859696| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}</ref> As of 2019, the estimated population was 28,039.\n\n==History==\nThe first settlers arrived in 1846 to farm cotton in the black fertile prairie soil.  Between 1850 and 1902, two settlements existed - Rock Hill was two miles south of the present town and Richland was one mile north.  The development of these small communities was expedited in 1876 when County Courts ordered small tracts of land to be established for quick sale.  These tracts, each about 160 acres in size, were sold for $3.50 per acre.  Dr. A. T. Bryant of McKinney purchased what later became the center of the present town.\n\nThe towns merged during the establishment of the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad in March 1902.  For years, Prosper was the central stop for the railroad between Dallas and Sherman.  When community officials applied for a post office with the name \"Richland\", they were informed that city name was already taken.  Postmaster B.J. Naugle asked for an alternative name and J.C. Slaughter suggested the name \"Prosper\", because crops that year had been very prosperous.\n\nThe Town of Prosper was incorporated in 1914 with a commission form of government and a population of 500.  U.N. Clary was mayor and served in that position for the next 49 years.\n[[Prosper High School]] cost $113.5 million to construct and is 590,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>, complete with a medical tech lab, a restaurant-worthy kitchen, a greenhouse, a broadcast studio, and an indoor football practice facility.\n\nThe Town of Prosper holds an annual Christmas festival and Fourth of July event.  Each May, Prosper Founders Fest celebrates its history, people, and arts.  The event combines the Prosper Fire Department's IBCA-sanctioned Barbecue Cookoff, a 5K race, an art show and music festival, and a Sunday Family Fellowship.\n\nProsper is a growing area with many new homes and communities being developed.
