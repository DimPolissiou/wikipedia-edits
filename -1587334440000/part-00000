After his family's murder, Amanullah is quietly slipped away to the UK to his step-uncle, who is highly abusive towards Amanullah. Unwanted and rightfully blaming Mir Farooq for his ill fortunes, Amanullah wants revenge and thus bides his time. Now an adult and with his deceased step uncle's immense wealth behind him, Amanullah hatches a plan to marry Mir Farooq's daughter Aina (Sajjal Ali) with a new identity. \n\nMir Farooq had also murdered his wife (Mira Sethi) when she had tried to run away from Mir Farooq with their infant daughter. Although Mir Farooq has told everyone that his wife died in a car accident, his daughter, now a grown woman, still has faded memories and dreams of her mother's murder.\n\nIn the present day, Mir Farooq has also murdered his employee in Singapore and no one gets to know how he was actually killed. He murdered his employee because he gave his company a massive loss.\n\nAlthough Mir Farooq plays the role of a doting father who has never married after his wife's death, he has secretly been married to his former secretary Sahira (Rabia Butt) for seven years. Amanullah has come to know about the third wife and has blackmailed her info revealing information about Mir Farooq including their wedding pictures. As Mir Farooq is quite abusive towards his secret wife, she decides to punish Mir Farooq out of spite. \n\nAli Baksh - who is the servant of Mir Farooq knows everything about his marriage and about the people he has killed.\n\nWhile Amanullah had planned every detail of his revenge, he did not plan to actually fall in love with his fianc\u00e9 Aina, who he sees as more of a victim than the daughter of his enemy, and starts having second thoughts about using her as a pawn in this revenge.\n\nDespite even calling off the marriage once, Aina is persistent in her love and Amanullah goes through with the wedding. For her niece's wedding, Aina's aunt, Farhana (younger sister of her Aina's deceased mother), comes to Pakistan from the US. During her trip, and due to some subtle insinuations from Amanullahs side, she begins to question the death of her sister. It is at first innocent, however as she realizes that stories are varying between the people she asked, she becomes suspicious and Mir Farooq sees that. He manages to get her to leave Pakistan quicker than Farhana intended, once in the US, she questions the event even more.\n\nAina and Amanullah's marriage has a shaky start, with Amanullah getting infuriated upon hearing either Ali Baksh's or Mir Farooq's name. He is abusive towards Aina but later waves it off with some excuse or other. One night, he injures himself and when Aina comes to help him, he proclaims \u201cthis blood is nothing compared to my father and mother\u201d. Aina is confused, later when asking him, she senses his hesitation and drops the subject.\n\nAina and Amanullah go on their honeymoon. Amanullah has recently reconciled with his childhood friend whom he enlists to buy a house (which now serves as a guest house operated by him) and Amanullah's childhood home but under his friend's name. Aman takes Aina to this house for their honeymoon. On the way there, Aina is visibly uncomfortable and feels she recognizes the place. She is uneasy, as she believes that her memories of this place are not good ones. \n\nNargis bua, Aina's household worker who helped raise her after her mother's death, leaves her post. Farhana tries to contact her, but Mir Farooq finds out. He is left very suspicious of Farhana's intention - as apparently Nargis knows of the real story.\n\nMir Farooq decides to end contact between Aina and Farhana. He tells Aina that Farhana didn't come for her wedding but instead says she came for Aina's/Aina's mom's jewelry and property.\n\nAs Aina and Aman's honeymoon progresses, Aina becomes more and more uncomfortable, and she gets flashes of memories of the same place from when she was younger. However, she can't seem to connect the dots and doesn't see them as flashbacks, rather the effect of some unnatural/evil presence in the place.\n\nThrough these flashbacks, which are quite vivid from Aman's side (meaning he remembers all of it clearly and is able to understand unlike Aina), it is revealed that Aman had a sister, and his mother Humaira ( [[Zarnish Khan]] ) and his father (a forest officer) lived here permanently. However, one day, Humaira and Neelofer ( [[Mira Sethi]] ) cross paths. Aina and her family used to stay in a holiday house near Aman's family (the same house Aman made his friend serve as a guest house) and would vacation for two months or so every few years. During their encounter, it was actually when Neelofer, Aina and Mir Farooq were staying there after a while, due to which their paths hadn't crossed before. \n\nNeelofer and Humaira become close. One flashback was of a swing, in Aman's backyard, on which Aina was swinging when Humaira and Neelofer had met up. Aina fell and suffered an injury on her chin- this was the scar that Aman had drawn on her face when he sketched a picture of her at a wedding upon their first encounter. Aina had wondered how he knew of it, as she would cover it up but when asked Aman brushed it off. The truth is now revealed and Aman seems a little more sinister.\n\nUpon exploring the house, in real-time, Aina stumbled across the remains of the swing and suffered a panic attack of sorts. Aman tires to calm down her notions of the 'hauntedness' of the house, by reassuring her that no such swing exists (despite Aina seeing it). He takes her back to the backyard and the swing is no longer there. It is revealed that Aman removed it on purpose, perhaps trying to trigger Aina's memories.\n\nOne other flashback Aman has, which is significant, is a memory of him, his mother, and Neelofer talking at her house. It is the first time Humaira actually meets Neelofer's husband (as Mir Farooq would always be busy). It turns out that Humaira and Mir knew each other, as they graduated together. Mir Farooq seems a bit shocked and stiff to see Humaira at his house, especially when Humaira reveals she's married and has two children.\n\nThis is significant because earlier on, in real-time, Mir Farooq was on his computer, looking at a photo of Humaira. A voiceover, which is Humaira, echoes (imitating his memory of her saying this) her apologizing, saying that she thinks Mir Farooq is a great friend, but has never thought or felt about him in 'that' way. This - combined with Aman's memory - is an almost obvious delusion to some affection Mir Farooq held for Humaira, and the one-sidedness of it. It is also a potential  revelation of the motive for murder.\n\nMir Farooq is suspicious of Sahira (who gave her nikkah papers to Aman out of spite earlier on). To throw him off her guard, Sahira concocts a story of a stalker, calling her from an unknown number, who stated that he knows of their marriage. Mir Farooq freaks out and orders, essentially, Sahira and her house to be put on 'lockdown' until he returns from Paris. Sahira tells Aman that Mir no longer suspects her, and Aman says that he no longer needs anything else from her, and urges her to not say anything about their exchange of information, to which she agrees. Aman also eludes to taking action against Mir soon.\n\nLater, Sahira calls Aman again and then calls her sister and in a distracted mental state, she walks out of the bathroom and the phone comes on the security footage which Ali Bakhsh saw. He informs Farooque that Sahira and hidden a sim and a phone in the bathroom. Farooque orders her death the day she was supposed to go to Dubai. Ali Bakhsh and a few others kill her on the way to the airport. Ali Bakhsh then makes a story that a few robbers came and Sahira refused to give anything and they shot her. They also shot the driver but he survived. The driver then told the wrong story to the police. Ali Bakhsh also made it clear that Sahira lived alone in her home and wasn't married when that isn't true.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Ahad Raza Mir]] as Amanullah Khan aka Amaan (Main Male Lead)\n* [[Sajal Aly]] as Noor-ul-Ain Khan aka Aina (Main Female Lead) \n* [[Adnan Siddiqui]] as Mir Farooq Zaman (Main Antagonist) \n* [[Zarnish Khan]] as Humaira, Amaanullah's mother\n* [[Mira Sethi]] as Neelofer Farooq\n* [[Farhan Ally Agha|Farhan Ali Agha]] as Ghauri\n* [[Paras Masroor]] as Ali Bakhsh\n* [[Rabia Butt]] as Sahira\n* [[Mariam Mirza]] as Ghauri's wife\n*Adnan Qureshi as Ubaidullah, Amaanullah's father\n*Yahya Ahmad as Ibrahim\n*Naima Khan as Nargis Bua \n*[[Syed Mohammad Ahmed]] as Dr.Arsalan (Anna's Doctor)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n* {{imdbtitle|tt11155074}}\n* [https://www.hum.tv/dramas/ye-dil-mera/ Official website]\n\n[[Category:Hum TV series]]\n[[Category:2019 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Pakistani romantic thriller films]]\n\n{{Pakistan-tv-stub}}\n[[Category:Urdu-language television programs]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Pakistani romantic thriller television series}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Use Pakistani English|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = Yeh Dil Mera\n| image     = Yeh Dil Mera.jpg\n| caption   = Official title card\n| show_name_2 = \n| native_name = \u06cc\u06c1 \u062f\u0644 \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0627\n| genre = [[Drama]]<br>Romance<br>Thriller\n| creator =\n| based_on =\n| developer =\n| writer = [[Farhat Ishtiaq]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1183889|title=Writer Farhat Ishtiaq hints there's more to the story of Yeh Dil Mera|last=Staff|first=Images|date=2019-10-22|website=DAWN|language=en|access-date=2019-10-27}}</ref>\n| screenplay =\n| story =\n| director = [[Ahson Talish]]\n| creative_director =\n| presenter =\n| starring = [[Ahad Raza Mir]]<br>[[Sajal Aly]]\n| judges =\n| voices =\n| narrated =\n| theme_music_composer =\n| opentheme =\n| endtheme =\n| composer =\n| country = Pakistan\n| language = Urdu\n| num_seasons = 1\n| num_episodes = 26 <!---(as of 22 April 2020)--->\n| list_episodes =\n| executive_producer =\n| producer = [[Momina Duraid]]\n| news_editor =\n| location =\n| cinematography =\n| editor =\n| camera =\n| runtime = approx. 36-38 minutes\n| company = [[MD Productions]]\n| distributor = [[Hum Network Limited]]\n| budget =\n| network = [[Hum TV]]\n| picture_format = [[576i]]<br />[[1080i]] ([[HDTV]])\n| audio_format = [[Stereo]]\n| first_run = Pakistan\n| released =\n| first_aired = 30 October 2019\n| last_aired = present\n| preceded_by =\n| followed_by =\n| related =\n| website =\n| production_website =\n}}\n'''''Yeh Dil Mera''''' ({{Lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|\u06cc\u06c1 \u062f\u0644 \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0627}}|lit=This heart of mine}}) is a 2019 [[Pakistani dramas|Pakistani]] [[romantic thriller]] television series that premiered on [[Hum TV]] on 30 October 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1183901|title=Ahad Raza Mir and Sajal Aly aren't as adorable as usual in new Yeh Dil Mera teasers|last=Staff|first=Images|date=2019-10-24|website=DAWN|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/2084105/4-sajal-aly-ahad-raza-mirs-new-drama-criticised-romanticising-workplace-harassment/|title=Sajal Aly, Ahad Raza Mir's new drama criticised for 'romanticising workplace harassment'|last=Tribune.com.pk|date=2019-10-21|website=The Express Tribune|language=en|access-date=2019-10-27}}</ref> It is produced by [[Momina Duraid]] under their banner [[MD Productions]].

For her niece's wedding, Aina's aunt, Farhana (younger sister of her Aina's deceased mother), comes to Pakistan from the US. During her trip, and due to some subtle insinuations from Amanullahs side, she begins to question the death of her sister. It is at first innocent, however as she realizes that stories are varying between the people she asked, she becomes suspicious and Mir Farooq sees that. He manages to get her to leave Pakistan quicker than Farhana intended, once in the US, she questions the event even more.\n\nAina and Amanullah's marriage has a shaky start, with Amanullah getting infuriated upon hearing either Ali Baksh's or Mir Farooq's name. He is abusive towards Aina but later waves it off with some excuse or other. One night, he injures himself and when Aina comes to help him, he proclaims \u201cthis blood is nothing compared to my father and mother\u201d. Aina is confused, later when asking him, she senses his hesitation and drops the subject.\n\nAina and Amanullah go on their honeymoon. Amanullah has recently reconciled with his childhood friend whom he enlists to buy a house (which now serves as a guest house operated by him) and Amanullah's childhood home but under his friends name. Aman takes Aina to this house for their honeymoon. On the way there, Aina is visibly uncomfortable, and feels she recognizes the place. She is uneasy, as she believes that her memories of this place are not good ones. \n\nNargis bua, Aina's household worker who helped raise her after her mother's death, leaves her post. Farhana tries to contact her, but Mir Farooq finds out. He is left very suspicious of Farhana's intention - as apparently Nargis knows of the real story.\n\nMir Farooq decides to end contact between Aina and Farhana. He tells Aina that Farhana didn't come for her wedding but instead says she came for Aina's/Aina's mom's jewellery and property.\n\nAs Aina and Aman's honeymoon progresses, Aina becomes more and more uncomfortable, and she gets flashes of memories of the same place from when she was younger. However, she can't seem to connect the dots and doesn't see them as flashbacks, rather the effect of some unnatural/evil presence in the place.\n\nThrough these flashbacks, which are quite vivid from Aman's side (meaning he remembers all of it clearly and is able to understand unlike Aina), it is revealed that Aman had a sister, and his mother Humaira ( [[Zarnish Khan]] ) and his father (a forest officer) lived here permanently. However, one day, Humaira and Neelofer ( [[Mira Sethi]] ) cross paths. Aina and her family used to stay in a holiday house near Aman's family (the same house Aman made his friend serve as a guest house) and would vacation for two months or so every few years. During their encounter, it was actually when Neelofer, Aina and Mir Farooq were staying there after a while, due to which their paths hadn't crossed before. \n\nNeelofer and Humaira become close. One flashback was of a swing, in Aman's backyard, on which Aina was swinging when Humaira and Neelofer had met up. Aina fell and suffered and injury on her chin- this was the scar that Aman had drawn on her face when he sketched a picture of her at a wedding upon their first encounter. Aina had wondered how he knew of it, as she would cover it up but when asked Aman brushed it off. The truth is now revealed and Aman seems a little more sinister.\n\nUpon exploring the house, in real time, Aina stumbled across the remains of the swing, and suffered a panic attack of sorts. Aman tires to calm down her notions of the 'hauntedness' of the house, by reassuring her that no such swing exists (despite Aina seeing it). He takes her back to the backyard and the swing is no longer there. It is revealed that Aman removed it on purpose, perhaps trying to trigger Aina's memories.\n\nOne other flashback Aman has, which is significant, is a memory of him, his mother, and Neelofer talking at her house. It is the first time Humaira actually meets Neelofer's husband (as Mir Farooq would always be busy). It turns out that Humaira and Mir knew each other, as they graduated together. Mir Farooq seems a bit shocked and stiff to see Humaira at his house, especially when Humaira reveals she's married and has two children.\n\nThis is significant because earlier on, in real time, Mir Farooq was on his computer, looking at a photo of Humaira. A voiceover, which is Humaira, echoes (imitating his memory of her saying this) her apologizing, saying that she thinks Mir Farooq is a great friend, but has never though or felt about him in 'that' way. This - combined with Aman's memory - is an almost obvious elusion to some affection Mir Farooq held for Humaira, and the one-sidedness of it. It is also potential  revelation of the motive for murder.\n\nMir Farooq is suspicious of Sahira (who gave her nikkah papers to Aman out of spite earlier on). To throw him off her guard, Sahira concocts a story of a stalker, calling her from an unknown number, who stated that he knows of their marriage. Mir Farooq freaks out and orders, essentially, Sahira and her house to be put on 'lockdown' until he returns from Paris. Sahira tells Aman that Mir no longer suspects her, and Aman says that he no longer needs anything else from her, and urges her to not say anything about their exchange of information, to which she agrees. Aman also eludes to taking action against Mir soon.\n\nLater, Sahira calls Aman again and then calls her sister and in a distracted mental state, she walks out of the bathroom and the phone comes on the security footage which Ali Bakhsh saw. He informs Farooque that Sahira and hidden a sim and a phone in the bathroom. Farooque orders her death the day she was supposed to go to Dubai. Ali Bakhsh and a few others kill her on the way to the airport. Ali Bakhsh then makes a story that a few robbers came and Sahira refused to give anything and they shot her. They also shot the driver but he survived. The driver then told the wrong story to the police. Ali Bakhsh also made it clear that Sahira lived alone in her home and wasn't married when that isn't true.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Ahad Raza Mir]] as Amanullah Khan aka Amaan (Main Male Lead)\n* [[Sajal Aly]] as Noor-ul-Ain Khan aka Aina (Main Female Lead) \n* [[Adnan Siddiqui]] as Mir Farooq Zaman (Main Antagonist) \n* [[Zarnish Khan]] as Humaira, Amaanullah's mother\n* [[Mira Sethi]] as Neelofer Farooq\n* [[Farhan Ally Agha|Farhan Ali Agha]] as Ghauri\n* [[Paras Masroor]] as Ali Bakhsh\n* [[Rabia Butt]] as Sahira\n* [[Mariam Mirza]] as Ghauri's wife\n*Adnan Qureshi as Ubaidullah, Amaanullah's father\n*Yahya Ahmad as Ibrahim\n*Naima Khan as Nargis Bua \n*[[Syed Mohammad Ahmed]] as Dr.Arsalan (Anna's Doctor)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n* {{imdbtitle|tt11155074}}\n* [https://www.hum.tv/dramas/ye-dil-mera/ Official website]\n\n[[Category:Hum TV series]]\n[[Category:2019 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Pakistani romantic thriller films]]\n\n{{Pakistan-tv-stub}}\n[[Category:Urdu-language television programs]]\n", "name_user": "Rafayali7", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeh_Dil_Mera"}

The contest lasted for 11:21 before Junji Hirata pinned Yuji Nagata after striking him with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Lariat|lariat]].<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/> This was the last match Nagata wrestled in Japan before travelling to the United States to work for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) as part of an \"educational tour\" that a lot of young Japanese wrestlers undertake to learn various styles of wrestling.<ref name=PS32/>\n\nThe second match of the night featured the debut of a character called \"Super Liger\", a silver and white version of [[Jushin Thunder Liger]] played by [[Chris Jericho]]. Super Liger wrestled [[Koji Kanemoto]] in what ''[[Power Slam]]'' Magazine correspondent Rob Butcher called \"A super aerial battle\". Super Liger won after 11 minutes and 11 seconds of action by using a [[Suplex#Tiger suplex|bridging tiger suplex]] to pin Kanemoto.<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/> NJPW intended to use \"Super Liger\" character as a storyline enemy of Jushin Thunder Liger, hoping to create a rivalry similar to the [[Tiger Mask#Professional wrestling|Tiger Mask]] vs. [[Black Tiger (professional wrestling)|Black Tiger]] rivalry.<ref name=PS32/> However, the character was so poorly received that it was never used again.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jericho|first=Chris| title=A Lion's Tale: Around the World in Spandex|url=https://archive.org/details/lionstalearoundt00jeri|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Grand Central Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the third match freelancer [[Jinsei Shinzaki]] defeated longtime NJPW midcarder [[Michiyoshi Ohara]] after using the [[Powerbomb#Crucifix powerbomb|Nenbutsu powerbomb]].<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/>\n\nMatches four, five, six and seven featured a \"NJPW vs. BJW\" premise as wrestlers representing the two companies wrestled against each other. In previous years NJPW had great success promoting \"inter-promotional rivalries\" against [[UWF International]], only this time they were working with the much smaller BJW.<ref name=PS32/> In the first match [[Shinjiro Otani]] defeated [[Yoshihiro Tajiri]] after a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Flying spinning heel kick|flying heel kick]] in what was described as the best contest of the NJPW vs. BJW series.<ref name=PS32/> [[Kendo Nagasaki]] defeated [[Tatsutoshi Goto]] to even the score to 1\u20131.<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/> NJPW headliner [[Masahiro Chono]] made very short work of BJW wrestler Shoji Nakamaki, defeating him with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Big boot|Yakuza kick]] in just over a minute.<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/> The final match of the series saw NJPW veteran [[Masa Saito]] defeat BJW president Shinya Kojika, who wrestled under the [[ring name]] The Great Kojika, to win the series 3 to 1.<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/>\n\nMatch number eight was billed as a [[Mixed martial arts]] match although it was still as predetermined as all the other matches of the night. NJPW founder [[Antonio Inoki]] took on Martial Artist Willie Williams in a rematch from a highly publicized match from 1980. In the end Inoki forced Williams to submit to a [[Professional wrestling holds#Abdominal stretch|ground cobra twist]] after 4:19.<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/>\n\nThe ninth match of the evening was originally supposed be for nine championships in total, but at the last minute WCW had not allowed [[\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n]] to put the [[WCW World Cruiserweight Championship]] on the line in the match, Drag\u00f3n still defended the [[J-Crown]] Championship, a championship consisting of eight unified titles. His opponent of the night was Jushin Thunder Liger, the driving force behind NJPW's very successful Light Heavyweight division and multiple time [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] holder, a belt that at the time was part of the J-Crown.<ref name=PS32/> Liger and Drag\u00f3n had previously wrestled at the 1993 January 4 Tokyo Dome show called ''[[#Fantastic Story in Tokyo Dome|Fantastic Story in Tokyo Dome]]''. After over 18 minutes of high flying wrestling Liger pinned Drag\u00f3n following a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Vertical suplex piledriver|Steiner Screwdriver]] to become the fourth J-Crown holder.<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/>\n\nThe storyline going into the tenth match of the evening was that of the first ever holders of the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]] wanted \"one last chance at the title that made them famous\" before retirement. Fujinami and Kimura took on [[Hiroyoshi Tenzan]] and Masahiro Chono (who had already wrestled that night, albeit in a very short match) for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. While the age of the challengers prevented the match from being a good wrestling match the antics of Tenzan and Chono and the emotion of the challengers \"last stand\" created a match the crowd in the Tokyo Dome enjoyed.<ref name=PS32/> The end came after Tenzan accidentally hit his partner, allowing Fujinami to apply a [[Professional wrestling holds#Dragon sleeper|dragon sleeper]] on Chono to force him to submit.<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/> With this victory Fujinami and Kimura became four-time tag team champions and the 29th overall champions.<ref name=PS32/>\n\nThe semi-main event of the evening was billed as a \"battle of the alter egos\" as [[Keiji Mutoh]] reverted to his \"Great Muta\" character and [[Kensuke Sasaki]] wrestled as \"Power Warrior\". While Mutoh and Sasaki tended to wrestle a more scientific style their face painted alter egos tended to brawl more. The match quickly turned into more of a brawl than a wrestling match with both participants using the ringside tables and a steel chair during the match.

In August, 1996 Choshu had surprisingly defeated Hashimoto during the 1996 [[G1 Climax#1996|G1 Climax]] tournament. Unlike their encounter in 1996 and unlike the tag team championship match the \"legend\" did not prevail in this match as Hashimoto pinned Choshu after a [[brainbuster]] following 18:04 of wrestling.\n\n==Results==\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|results=<ref name=PS32/>\n|times=<ref name=Jan4-97>{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/newjapan/tokyodome.html#97a | title= Wrestling World in Tokyo Dome 1997 | date= January 4, 1997 | accessdate= April 13, 2010 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref>\n|match1=[[Junji Hirata]], [[Manabu Nakanishi]], [[Osamu Nishimura]] and [[Satoshi Kojima]] defeated [[Kazuo Yamazaki]], [[Osamu Kido]], [[Takayuki Iizuka]] and [[Yuji Nagata]]\n|stip1=[[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Multiple man teamed matches|Eight-man tag team match]]\n|time1=11:21\n|match2=[[Chris Jericho|Super Liger]] defeated [[Koji Kanemoto]]\n|stip2=[[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|Singles match]]\n|time2=11:11\n|match3=[[Jinsei Shinzaki]] defeated [[Michiyoshi Ohara]]\n|stip3=Singles match\n|time3=09:17\n|match4=[[Shinjiro Otani]] defeated [[Yoshihiro Tajiri]]\n|stip4=Singles match: NJPW (1) vs. BJW (0)\n|time4=08:30\n|match5=[[Kendo Nagasaki]] defeated [[Tatsutoshi Goto]]\n|stip5=Singles match: NJPW (1) vs. BJW (1)\n|time5=09:23\n|match6=[[Masahiro Chono]] defeated Shoji Nakamaki\n|stip6=Singles match: NJPW (2) vs. BJW (1)\n|time6=01:07\n|match7=[[Masa Saito]] defeated Shinya Kojika\n|stip7=Singles match: NJPW (3) vs. BJW (1)\n|time7=04:25\n|match8=[[Antonio Inoki]] defeated Willie Williams\n|stip8=[[Mixed martial arts]] match\n|time8=04:19\n|match9=[[Jushin Thunder Liger]] defeated [[\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n]] (c)\n|stip9=Singles match for the [[J-Crown]] Championship\n|time9=18:21\n|match10=[[Kengo Kimura]] and [[Tatsumi Fujinami]] defeated [[Cho-Ten]] ([[Hiroyoshi Tenzan]] and [[Masahiro Chono]]) (c)\n|stip10=[[Tag team]] match for the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]]\n|time10=16:10\n|match11=[[Power Warrior]] defeated [[The Great Muta]]\n|stip11=Singles match\n|time11=16:09\n|match12=[[Shinya Hashimoto]] (c) defeated [[Riki Choshu]]\n|stip12=Singles match for the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]]\n|time12=18:04\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.njpw.co.jp/ NJPW.co.jp] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{New Japan Pro Wrestling events|January 4 Tokyo Dome Show}}\n\n[[Category:1997 in professional wrestling]]\n[[Category:1997 in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:January 1997 events in Asia]]\n[[Category:Big Japan Pro Wrestling shows]]\n[[Category:January 4 Tokyo Dome Show|Wrestling World 1997]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestling joint events]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Wrestling event\n|name = Wrestling World 1997\n|image =File:Antonio Inoki IMG 0398-2 20121224.JPG\n|alt =\n|caption =[[Antonio Inoki]], who defeated Willie Williams at the event.\n|promotion = [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]]<br />[[Big Japan Pro Wrestling]]\n|date = {{dts|1997|1|4}}<ref name=PS32>{{cite news|author=Butcher, Rob|title=The Money Factory|pages=26\u201327|work=[[Power Slam]] Magazine|id=32|date=March 1997|publisher=SW Publishing LTD|location=[[Lancaster, Lancashire]], [[England]]}}</ref>\n|venue = [[Tokyo Dome]]\n|city = [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]\n|attendance = 62,500<ref name=PS32/> (official)<br />52,500 (claimed)\n|liveevent = N\n|event = [[January 4 Tokyo Dome Show]]\n|lastevent2 = [[Wrestling World 1996|Wrestling World]]\n|nextevent2 = [[Final Power Hall in Tokyo Dome]]\n}}\n'''Wrestling World 1997'''  was a professional wrestling event co-produced by the [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) and [[Big Japan Pro Wrestling]] (BJW) [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotions]]. It took place on January 4, 1997 in the [[Tokyo Dome]]. Officially, the show drew 62,500 spectators and $5,000,000 in ticket sales.<ref name=PS32/> The show featured 12 matches, including four matches that were promoted jointly with the BJW promotion and presented as a rivalry between the two promotions. The show featured 12 matches in total, including three title matches, two of which saw new champions crowned.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nThe [[January 4 Tokyo Dome Show]] is NJPW's biggest [[List of NJPW pay-per-view events|annual event]] and has been called \"the largest professional wrestling show in the world outside of the United States\" and the \"Japanese equivalent to the [[Super Bowl]]\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestling.net/article.php?40241 | title = GFW News: New Japan Pro Wrestling \"Wrestle Kingdom 9\" press conference details | date=December 23, 2014 | accessdate=October 9, 2017 | work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net}}</ref><ref name=WK11AXSPWT>{{cite web | url = http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/12/13/new-japans-wrestlekingdom-11-air-axs-tv-starting-jan-13-four-weekly-special-episodes-ross-barnett-commentary/ | title = New Japan's WrestleKingdom 11 to air on AXS TV starting Jan. 13 in four weekly special episodes with Ross & Barnett on commentary | last=Keller | first=Wade | authorlink=Wade Keller | date=December 13, 2016 | accessdate=October 9, 2017 | work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref> \n\n===Storylines===\nWrestling World 1997 featured [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and [[Narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers portrayed [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]], [[Face (professional wrestling)|heroes]], or [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#tweener|less distinguishable characters]] in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling.htm | title = How Pro Wrestling Works | last=Grabianowski | first=Ed | accessdate=October 9, 2017 | work=HowStuffWorks, Inc. | publisher=[[Discovery Communications]]}}</ref>\n\n==Event==\n===Preliminary matches===\nThe first match of the show was an [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Multiple man teamed matches|eight-man tag team match]] which on one side featured [[Junji Hirata]], [[Satoshi Kojima]], [[Manabu Nakanishi]] and [[Osamu Nishimura]] going against [[Takayuki Iizuka|Takashi Iizuka]], [[Osamu Kido]], [[Yuji Nagata]] and [[Kazuo Yamazaki]]. The contest lasted for 11:21 before Junji Hirata pinned Yuji Nagata after striking him with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Lariat|lariat]].<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/> This was the last match Nagata wrestled in Japan before travelling to the United States to work for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) as part of an \"educational tour\" that a lot of young Japanese wrestlers undertake to learn various styles of wrestling.<ref name=PS32/>\n\nThe second match of the night featured the debut of a character called \"Super Liger\", a silver and white version of [[Jushin Thunder Liger]] played by [[Chris Jericho]]. Super Liger wrestled [[Koji Kanemoto]] in what ''[[Power Slam]]'' Magazine correspondent Rob Butcher called \"A super aerial battle\". Super Liger won after 11 minutes and 11 seconds of action by using a [[Suplex#Tiger suplex|bridging tiger suplex]] to pin Kanemoto.<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/> NJPW intended to use \"Super Liger\" character as a storyline enemy of Jushin Thunder Liger, hoping to create a rivalry similar to the [[Tiger Mask#Professional wrestling|Tiger Mask]] vs. [[Black Tiger (professional wrestling)|Black Tiger]] rivalry.<ref name=PS32/> However, the character was so poorly received that it was never used again.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jericho|first=Chris| title=A Lion's Tale: Around the World in Spandex|url=https://archive.org/details/lionstalearoundt00jeri|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Grand Central Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the third match freelancer [[Jinsei Shinzaki]] defeated longtime NJPW midcarder [[Michiyoshi Ohara]] after using the [[Powerbomb#Crucifix powerbomb|Nenbutsu powerbomb]].<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/>\n\nMatches four, five, six and seven featured a \"NJPW vs. BJW\" premise as wrestlers representing the two companies wrestled against each other. In previous years NJPW had great success promoting \"inter-promotional rivalries\" against [[UWF International]], only this time they were working with the much smaller BJW.<ref name=PS32/> In the first match [[Shinjiro Otani]] defeated [[Yoshihiro Tajiri]] after a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Flying spinning heel kick|flying heel kick]] in what was described as the best contest of the NJPW vs. BJW series.<ref name=PS32/> [[Kendo Nagasaki]] defeated [[Tatsutoshi Goto]] to even the score to 1\u20131.<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/> NJPW headliner [[Masahiro Chono]] made very short work of BJW wrestler Shoji Nakamaki, defeating him with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Big boot|Yakuza kick]] in just over a minute.<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/> The final match of the series saw NJPW veteran [[Masa Saito]] defeat BJW president Shinya Kojika, who wrestled under the [[ring name]] The Great Kojika, to win the series 3 to 1.<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/>\n\nMatch number eight was billed as a [[Mixed martial arts]] match although it was still as predetermined as all the other matches of the night. NJPW founder [[Antonio Inoki]] took on Martial Artist Willie Williams in a rematch from a highly publicized match from 1980. In the end Inoki forced Williams to submit to a [[Professional wrestling holds#Abdominal stretch|ground cobra twist]] after 4:19.<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/>\n\nThe ninth match of the evening was originally supposed be for nine championships in total, but at the last minute WCW had not allowed [[\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n]] to put the [[WCW World Cruiserweight Championship]] on the line in the match, Drag\u00f3n still defended the [[J-Crown]] Championship, a championship consisting of eight unified titles. His opponent of the night was Jushin Thunder Liger, the driving force behind NJPW's very successful Light Heavyweight division and multiple time [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] holder, a belt that at the time was part of the J-Crown.<ref name=PS32/> Liger and Drag\u00f3n had previously wrestled at the 1993 January 4 Tokyo Dome show called ''[[#Fantastic Story in Tokyo Dome|Fantastic Story in Tokyo Dome]]''. After over 18 minutes of high flying wrestling Liger pinned Drag\u00f3n following a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Vertical suplex piledriver|Steiner Screwdriver]] to become the fourth J-Crown holder.<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/>\n\nThe storyline going into the tenth match of the evening was that of the first ever holders of the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]] wanted \"one last chance at the title that made them famous\" before retirement. Fujinami and Kimura took on [[Hiroyoshi Tenzan]] and Masahiro Chono (who had already wrestled that night, albeit in a very short match) for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. While the age of the challengers prevented the match from being a good wrestling match the antics of Tenzan and Chono and the emotion of the challengers \"last stand\" created a match the crowd in the Tokyo Dome enjoyed.<ref name=PS32/> The end came after Tenzan accidentally hit his partner, allowing Fujinami to apply a [[Professional wrestling holds#Dragon sleeper|dragon sleeper]] on Chono to force him to submit.<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/> With this victory Fujinami and Kimura became four-time tag team champions and the 29th overall champions.<ref name=PS32/>\n\nThe semi-main event of the evening was billed as a \"battle of the alter egos\" as [[Keiji Mutoh]] reverted to his \"Great Muta\" character and [[Kensuke Sasaki]] wrestled as \"Power Warrior\". While Mutoh and Sasaki tended to wrestle a more scientific style their face painted alter egos tended to brawl more. The match quickly turned into more of a brawl than a wrestling match with both participants using the ringside tables and a steel chair during the match. Power Warrior won after moving out of the way of a [[Moonsault]] from Muta allowing him to drive Muta into a table with his [[Brainbuster#Scoop brainbuster|Northern Lights bomb]] for the victory.<ref name=PS32/><ref name=Jan4-97/>\n\n===Main event===\nThe main event of the show featured the same \"last stand\" storyline that was used in the tag team title match as NJPW veteran [[Riki Choshu]] challenged [[Shinya Hashimoto]] for the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]]. In August, 1996 Choshu had surprisingly defeated Hashimoto during the 1996 [[G1 Climax#1996|G1 Climax]] tournament.
