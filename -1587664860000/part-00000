It was during one of these stints that Brad met future Blind Melon rhythm guitarist Christopher Thorn.<ref name=\"Prato 2008\"/>  Rogers called Glen Graham to come out to Los Angeles to be the band's drummer.  After auditioning many singers the band met fellow member [[Shannon Hoon]] at a party through a mutual friend.  During his audition, he played his song \"Change\" on acoustic guitar, and the band immediately picked him.<ref name=\"Prato 2008\"/>\n\nWith the band's lineup and name set, the band was signed to Capitol Records in 1991.  Capitol Records released their self-titled debut album, [[Blind Melon (album)|Blind Melon]], in September 1992.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\">{{cite web|title=Blind Melon Official Myspace|url=http://www.myspace.com/blindmelon|publisher=Myspace.com/blendmelon|accessdate=2014-07-11}}</ref>  The track \"[[No Rain]]\" became a smash hit, and brought Blind Melon into the spotlight, and causing their debut album to eventually go platinum four times over.  Blind Melon spent 1993 on tour, opening for acts such as [[Neil Young]] and [[Lenny Kravitz]], and starting in 1994, they began headlining their own tour.  Around this time, Blind Melon was nominated Grammys for Best New Artist and Best Rock Performance.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>\n\nDuring the touring, Hoon's drug use began to escalate.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>  His girlfriend, Lisa Sinha, gave birth to their first daughter, Nico Blue Hoon, in early 1995, and their second album, [[Soup (Blind Melon album)|Soup]], was released in August 1995.  At the encouragement of the rest of the band, he checked himself into rehab.  Despite concern of Hoon going back to his dangerous ways, the band went on tour in support of Soup, with a drug counselor accompanying Hoon.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>  The counselor could not keep Hoon from going back to his drug use, and left the tour after only a month and a half.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>  Hoon was found dead at the age of 28 on the band's tour bus the night after a concert from an accidental drug overdose on October 21, 1995.  The band released their final album, [[Nico (album)|Nico]], named after Hoon's daughter, in 1996.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>\n\nDespite efforts to keep the band going by auditioning for new singers, the band realized they could not keep going, and eventually went their separate ways in 1999.  Stevens has stated that he believed at that point that the band was finished and that they never considered playing together again.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>\n\nDespite this, in late 2006, an agent from Atlantic Records brought vocalist Travis Warren to Brad Smith and Christopher Thorn's studio to work on his demos and to get him a record contract.  After listening to Warren, the band got the idea to bring Warren in as the singer of Blind Melon, and called Rogers back to the studio. Blind Melon reformed, with Travis Warren as the new lead vocalist, and released For My Friends, their first studio album in 12 years.  Warren left the band in 2008; he has since started performing with them again as of 2010.<ref name=\"Clarke\"/>\n\n===Other musical projects and personal life===\nFollowing the break of Blind Melon, in 1999, Rogers and musician Rene Lopez formed the band Extra Virgin.  They released one album, titled \"12 Stories High\", which was recorded in at Kingsway in New Orleans.  The sound of the band is said to be \"in the same neighborhood\" as the music of Blind Melon, his previous band.  Despite gaining record label interests, the band broke up in 2002.<ref name=\"Prato\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|title=Interview with Rogers Stevens for New York regional paper, The Island Ear|url=http://blindmelon.org/articles/18.htm|publisher=Blindmerlon.org|accessdate=2014-07-11}}</ref>\n\nAfter this breakup, he started the band The Tender Trio with Rene Lopez and Royston Langdon of [[Spacehog]] fame.  The band broke up in March 2006.\n\nStevens has stated that he plays guitar and paints in his free time.

It was during one of these stints that Brad met future Blind Melon rhythm guitarist Christopher Thorn.<ref name=\"Prato 2008\"/>  Rogers called Glen Graham to come out to Los Angeles to be the band's drummer.  After auditioning many singers the band met fellow member [[Shannon Hoon]] at a party through a mutual friend.  During his audition, he played his song \"Change\" on acoustic guitar, and the band immediately picked him.<ref name=\"Prato 2008\"/>\n\nWith the band's lineup and name set, the band was signed to Capitol Records in 1991.  Capitol Records released their self-titled debut album, [[Blind Melon (album)|Blind Melon]], in September 1992.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\">{{cite web|title=Blind Melon Official Myspace|url=http://www.myspace.com/blindmelon|publisher=Myspace.com/blendmelon|accessdate=2014-07-11}}</ref>  The track \"[[No Rain]]\" became a smash hit, and brought Blind Melon into the spotlight, and causing their debut album to eventually go platinum four times over.  Blind Melon spent 1993 on tour, opening for acts such as [[Neil Young]] and [[Lenny Kravitz]], and starting in 1994, they began headlining their own tour.  Around this time, Blind Melon was nominated Grammys for Best New Artist and Best Rock Performance.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>\n\nDuring the touring, Hoon's drug use began to escalate.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>  His girlfriend, Lisa Sinha, gave birth to their first daughter, Nico Blue Hoon, in early 1995, and their second album, [[Soup (Blind Melon album)|Soup]], was released in August 1995.  At the encouragement of the rest of the band, he checked himself into rehab.  Despite concern of Hoon going back to his dangerous ways, the band went on tour in support of Soup, with a drug counselor accompanying Hoon.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>  The counselor could not keep Hoon from going back to his drug use, and left the tour after only a month and a half.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>  Hoon was found dead at the age of 28 on the band's tour bus the night after a concert from an accidental drug overdose on October 21, 1995.  The band released their final album, [[Nico (album)|Nico]], named after Hoon's daughter, in 1996.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>\n\nDespite efforts to keep the band going by auditioning for new singers, the band realized they could not keep going, and eventually went their separate ways in 1999.  Stevens has stated that he believed at that point that the band was finished and that they never considered playing together again.<ref name=\"Blind Melon Official Myspace\"/>\n\nDespite this, in late 2006, an agent from Atlantic Records brought vocalist Travis Warren to Brad Smith and Christopher Thorn's studio to work on his demos and to get him a record contract.  After listening to Warren, the band got the idea to bring Warren in as the singer of Blind Melon, and called Rogers back to the studio. Blind Melon reformed, with Travis Warren as the new lead vocalist, and released For My Friends, their first studio album in 12 years.  Warren left the band in 2008; he has since started performing with them again as of 2010.<ref name=\"Clarke\"/>\n\n===Other musical projects and personal life===\nFollowing the break of Blind Melon, in 1999, Rogers and musician Rene Lopez formed the band Extra Virgin.  They released one album, titled \"12 Stories High\", which was recorded in at Kingsway in New Orleans.  The sound of the band is said to be \"in the same neighborhood\" as the music of Blind Melon, his previous band.  Despite gaining record label interests, the band broke up in 2002.<ref name=\"Prato\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|title=Interview with Rogers Stevens for New York regional paper, The Island Ear|url=http://blindmelon.org/articles/18.htm|publisher=Blindmerlon.org|accessdate=2014-07-11}}</ref>\n\nAfter this breakup, he started the band The Tender Trio with Rene Lopez and Royston Langdon of [[Spacehog]] fame.
