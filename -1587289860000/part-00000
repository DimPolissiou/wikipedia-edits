In this historical context, PRS comprises three stages equivalent to those subsumed within PRS: thesis (intellectual proposition, problem), antithesis (negation of the proposition, response to thesis), and synthesis (resolution of tension between proposition and reaction, resolution).

Specifically, at a standard pressure of 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]], water is a liquid between {{convert|0|and|100|C}}. Increasing the pressure slightly lowers the [[melting point]], which is about {{convert|-5|C}} at 600 atm and {{convert|-22|C}} at 2100 atm. This effect is relevant, for example, to [[ice skating]], to the [[Lake Vostok|buried lakes of Antarctica]], and to the movement of [[glacier]]s. At pressures higher than 2100 atm the melting point rapidly increases again, and ice takes several exotic forms that do not exist at lower pressures.\n\nIncreasing the pressure has a more dramatic effect on the [[boiling point]], that is about {{convert|374|C}} at 220 atm. This effect is important in, among other things, deep-sea [[hydrothermal vents]] and [[geyser]]s, [[pressure cooking]], and [[steam engine]] design. At the top of [[Mount Everest]], where the atmospheric pressure is about 0.34 atm, water boils at {{convert|68|C}}.\n\nAt very low pressures (below about 0.006 atm), water cannot exist in the liquid state and passes directly from solid to gas by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]\u2014a phenomenon exploited in the [[freeze drying]] of food. At very high pressures (above 221 atm), the liquid and gas states are no longer distinguishable, a state called [[supercritical fluid|supercritical steam]].\n\nWater also differs from most liquids in that it becomes less [[density|dense]] as it freezes.

Many inorganic substances are insoluble too, including most metal [[oxide]]s, [[sulfide]]s, and [[silicate]]s.\n\nBecause of its polarity, a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four [[hydrogen bonds]] with neighboring molecules.

Through [[erosion]], runoff shapes the environment creating river [[valley]]s and [[river delta|deltas]] which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers. A flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. It is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea. A drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply. This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation.\n\n===Fresh water storage===\n{{Main|Water resources}}\n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 1\n| total_width = 150\n| align = \n| direction = \n| width = \n| image1 = Bay of Fundy High Tide.jpg\n| width1 = \n| caption1 = \n| height1 = \n| image2 = Bay of Fundy Low Tide.jpg\n| width2 = \n| caption2 = \n| height2 = \n| footer = The [[Bay of Fundy]] at high tide and low tide.

Of the total volume of global freshwater, an estimated 69 percent is stored in glaciers and permanent snow cover; 30 percent is in groundwater; and the remaining 1 percent in lakes, rivers, the atmosphere, and biota.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Water in Crisis |last=Gleick |first=Peter H. |date=1993 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=019507627-3 |edition=1 |location=New York |publication-date=1993 |page=[https://archive.org/details/waterincrisisgui00glei/page/13 13] |url=https://archive.org/details/waterincrisisgui00glei/page/13 }}</ref> The length of time water remains in storage is highly variable: some aquifers consist of water stored over thousands of years but lake volumes may fluctuate on a seasonal basis, decreasing during dry periods and increasing during wet ones.

By some estimates, as much as 30 percent of total water used for irrigation comes from unsustainable withdrawals of groundwater, causing groundwater depletion.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Yoshihide|last1=Wada |first2=L.P.H.|last2=Van Beek|first3=Marc FP |last3=Bierkens|title=Nonsustainable groundwater sustaining irrigation: A global assessment|journal=Water Resources Research |date= 2012 |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=W00L06 |doi=10.1029/2011WR010562|bibcode=2012WRR....48.0L06W }}</ref>\n\n===Sea water and tides===\n{{Main|Seawater|Tides}}\n[[Seawater|Sea water]] contains about 3.5% [[sodium chloride]] on average, plus smaller amounts of other substances. The physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower temperature (about {{convert|-1.9|C}}) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the [[Baltic Sea]] to 4.0% in the [[Red Sea]]. (The [[Dead Sea]], known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30\u201340%, is really a [[salt lake]].)\n\n[[Tide]]s are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the [[tidal force]]s of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and [[estuary|estuarine]] water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams. The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the [[Coriolis effect|effects of Earth rotation]] and the local [[bathymetry]]. The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the [[intertidal zone]], is an important ecological product of ocean tides.\n\n==Effects on life==\n[[File:Oasis in Lybia.JPG|thumb|left|An [[oasis]] is an isolated [[water source]] with vegetation in a [[desert]].]]\n[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.svg|thumb|right|Overview of [[photosynthesis|<span style=\"color:green;\">photosynthesis (green)</span>]] and [[cellular respiration|<span style=\"color:red;\">respiration (red)</span>]]. Water (at right), together with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), form oxygen and organic compounds (at left), which can be respired to water and (CO<sub>2</sub>).]]\n\nFrom a [[biology|biological]] standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life. It carries out this role by allowing [[organic compound]]s to react in ways that ultimately allow [[Self-replication|replication]]. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a [[solvent]] in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of [[anabolism]] and [[catabolism]]. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g., starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g., glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.\n\nWater is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Hydrogen is combined with CO<sub>2</sub> (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO<sub>2</sub> in the process (cellular respiration).\n\nWater is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a [[pH]] (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. [[Acids]] have pH values less than 7 while [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] have values greater than 7.\n\n===Aquatic life forms===\n{{Further|Hydrobiology|Marine life|Aquatic plant}}\n[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright|Some of the [[biodiversity]] of a [[coral reef]]]]\n[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|Some marine [[diatom]]s \u2013 a key [[phytoplankton]] group]]\nEarth surface waters are filled with life. The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales. Some kinds of animals, such as [[amphibian]]s, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Plants such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]] is generally the foundation of the ocean [[food chain]].\n\nAquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways. Fish have [[gills]] instead of [[lungs]], although some species of fish, such as the [[lungfish]], have both. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as dolphins, whales, [[otter]]s, and [[pinniped|seals]] need to surface periodically to breathe air. Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see [[Siphon (insect)|insect]] and [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]]) and [[gills]] (''[[Carcinus]]''). However as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialization for respiration in water.\n\n==Effects on human civilization==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Longwood Gardens-Italian Garden.jpg|thumb|right|Water [[fountain]]]]\n\nCivilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; [[Mesopotamia]], the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]; the ancient society of the [[Egyptians]] depended entirely upon the [[Nile]]. Rome was also founded on the banks of the Italian river [[Tiber]]. Large [[metropolis]]es like [[Rotterdam]], London, Montreal, Paris, New York City, [[Buenos Aires]], Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago, and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade. Islands with safe water ports, like Singapore, have flourished for the same reason. In places such as North Africa and the Middle East, where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.\n\n===Health and pollution===\n[[File:Field Trip- water sampling.jpg|thumb|An environmental science program \u2013 a student from [[Iowa State University]] sampling water]]\nWater fit for human consumption is called [[drinking water]] or potable water. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or [[distillation]], or by a range of [[Water treatment|other methods]].\n\nWater that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called [[safe water]], or \"safe for bathing\". Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1\u20132 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as [[chlorine]] or [[ozone]] or by the use of [[ultraviolet]] light.\n\nIn the US, non-potable forms of [[wastewater]] generated by humans may be referred to as [[greywater]], which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], which generally contains [[sewage]] and other forms of waste which require [[Sewage treatment|further treatment]] in order to be made reusable. Greywater composes 50\u201380% of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment ([[sink]]s, showers and kitchen runoff, but not toilets, which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.\n\nThis natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability is a major social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. In 2000, the [[United Nations]] established the [[Millennium Development Goals]] for water to halve by 2015 the proportion of people worldwide without access to safe water and [[sanitation]]. Progress toward that goal was uneven, and in 2015 the UN committed to the following targets set by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] of achieving universal access to safe and affordable water and sanitation by 2030. Poor [[water quality]] and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by water-related diseases. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that [[safe water]] could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from [[diarrhea]] each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/qa/70/en/ |title=World Health Organization.

At the time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of [[peak water]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gleick |first=P.H. |title=Peak Water |url=http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |accessdate=11 October 2011 |year=2010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1004812107 |pmid=20498082 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107 |issue=125 |pages=11155\u201311162 |last2=Palaniappan |first2=M. |bibcode=2010PNAS..10711155G |pmc=2895062 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108224340/http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |archive-date=8 November 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> This is because there are now nearly eight billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanization and biofuel crops.

(Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: [[A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]].'' Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.</ref> It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of [[physical water scarcity]], where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing [[economic water scarcity]], where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.<ref>Chartres, C. and Varma, S.

Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through [[urine]] and [[feces]], through [[sweat]]ing, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath. With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well.\n\nHumans require water with few impurities. Common impurities include metal salts and oxides, including copper, iron, calcium and lead,<ref>''Conquering Chemistry'' 4th Ed. Published 2008</ref> and/or harmful bacteria, such as ''[[Vibrio]]''.

Washing is also an important component of several aspects of personal [[body hygiene]]. Most of personal water use is due to [[shower]]ing, doing the [[laundry]] and [[dishwashing]], reaching hundreds of liters per day per person in developed countries.\n\n====Transportation====\n{{Main|Ship transport}}\nThe use of water for transportation of materials through rivers and canals as well as the international shipping lanes is an important part of the world economy.\n\n====Chemical uses====\nWater is widely used in chemical reactions as a [[solvent]] or [[reactant]] and less commonly as a [[solution|solute]] or [[catalyst]]. In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds, as well as other polar compounds such as [[ammonia]] and [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|compounds closely related to water]]. In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is [[amphoteric]] (acidic ''and'' basic) and [[nucleophilic]]. Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable. Also, acceleration of [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s by water has been observed. [[Supercritical water]] has recently been a topic of research. Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently. Water vapor is used for some processes in the chemical industry. An example is the production of acrylic acid from acrolein, propylene and propane.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The reaction network in propane oxidation over phase-pure MoVTeNb M1 oxide catalysts|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2014|volume=311|pages=369\u2013385|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2013.12.008|last1=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first1=Raoul|last2=Csepei|first2=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last3=H\u00e4vecker|first3=Michael|last4=Girgsdies|first4=Frank|last5=Schuster|first5=Manfred E|last6=Schl\u00f6gl|first6=Robert|last7=Trunschke|first7=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0014-F434-5|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215104605/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|archive-date=15 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Surface chemistry of phase-pure M1 MoVTeNb oxide during operation in selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2012|volume=285|pages=48\u201360|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2011.09.012|last1=H\u00e4vecker|first1=Michael|last2=Wrabetz|first2=Sabine|last3=Kr\u00f6hnert|first3=Jutta|last4=Csepei|first4=Lenard-Istvan|last5=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first5=Raoul|last6=Kolen'Ko|first6=Yury V|last7=Girgsdies|first7=Frank|last8=Schl\u00f6gl|first8=Robert|last9=Trunschke|first9=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-1BEB-F|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030003154/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Kinetic studies of propane oxidation on Mo and V based mixed oxide catalysts|date=2011|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220044522/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Multifunctionality of Crystalline MoV(TeNb) M1 Oxide Catalysts in Selective Oxidation of Propane and Benzyl Alcohol|journal=ACS Catalysis|date=2013|volume=3|issue=6|pages=1103\u20131113|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|doi=10.1021/cs400010q|last1=Amakawa|first1=Kazuhiko|last2=Kolen'Ko|first2=Yury V|last3=Villa|first3=Alberto|last4=Schuster|first4=Manfred E/|last5=Csepei|first5=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last6=Weinberg|first6=Gisela|last7=Wrabetz|first7=Sabine|last8=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first8=Raoul|last9=Girgsdies|first9=Frank|last10=Prati|first10=Laura|last11=Schl\u00f6gl|first11=Robert|last12=Trunschke|first12=Annette|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022030814/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|archive-date=22 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The possible effect of water in these reactions includes the physical-, chemical interaction of water with the catalyst and the chemical reaction of water with the reaction intermediates.\n\n====Heat exchange====\nWater and steam are a common fluid used for [[heat exchanger|heat exchange]], due to its availability and high [[Heat capacity of water|heat capacity]], both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through [[vaporization]] and [[condensation]] of water because of its large [[latent heat of vaporization]]. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are [[oxidation|oxidized]] faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all [[thermal power station]]s, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by [[evaporation]] in a [[cooling tower]]). In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.<ref name=\"Water Use in the United States\">[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html Water Use in the United States], National Atlas.gov  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814045418/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html |date=14 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[nuclear power]] industry, water can also be used as a [[neutron moderator]]. In most [[nuclear reactor]]s, water is both a coolant and a moderator. This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also [[void coefficient|slows the nuclear reaction down]]. However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.\n\n====Fire considerations====\n[[File:MH-60S Helicopter dumps water onto Fire.jpg|right|thumb|Water is used for [[fire fighting|fighting]] [[wildfire]]s.]]\nWater has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good [[Fire fighting#Use of water|fire extinguishing]] fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.\n\nUse of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a [[steam explosion]], which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal, [[charcoal]], or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] graphite, decompose the water, producing [[water gas]].\n\nThe power of such explosions was seen in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system. A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam. A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot [[zirconium]].\n\nSome metallic oxides, most notably those of [[alkali metals]] and [[alkaline earth metals]], produce so much heat on reaction with water that a fire hazard can develop. The alkaline earth oxide [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] is a mass-produced substance which is often transported in paper bags. If these are soaked through, they may ignite as their contents react with water.<ref>{{cite web |title=Material Safety Data Sheet: Quicklime |url=https://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |publisher=Lhoist North America |date=6 August 2012 |accessdate=24 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705030051/http://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |archive-date=5 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Recreation====\n{{Main|Water sport (recreation)}}\n[[File:Johny Cay.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Andr\u00e9s (island)|San Andr\u00e9s island]], [[Colombia]].]]\n\nHumans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports. Some of these include swimming, [[waterskiing]], [[boating]], [[surfing]] and [[Underwater diving|diving]]. In addition, some sports, like [[ice hockey]] and [[ice skating]], are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and [[water park]]s are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other life in [[aquarium]]s or ponds for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. [[skiing]], [[sledding]], [[snowmobiling]] or [[snowboarding]], which require the water to be frozen.\n\n====Water industry====\n[[File:Water carrier in India.jpg|thumb|upright|A water-carrier in India, 1882. In many places where running water is not available, water has to be transported by people.]]\n[[File:TapWater-china.JPG|thumb|A manual water [[pump]] in China]]\n[[File:Usine Bret MG 1648.jpg|thumb|[[Water purification]] facility]]\n[[File:Reverse osmosis desalination plant.JPG|thumb|[[Reverse osmosis]] (RO) [[desalination]] plant in [[Barcelona]], Spain]]\n\nThe [[water industry]] provides drinking water and [[wastewater]] services (including [[sewage treatment]]) to households and industry. [[Water supply]] facilities include [[water well]]s, [[cistern]]s for [[rainwater harvesting]], [[water supply network]]s, and [[water purification]] facilities, [[water tank]]s, [[water tower]]s, [[water pipe]]s including old [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s are in development.\n\nDrinking water is often collected at [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], extracted from artificial [[Boring (earth)|borings]] (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful [[microbe]]s. Popular methods are [[filter (water)|filtering]] with sand which only removes undissolved material, while [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and [[boiling]] kill harmful microbes. [[Distillation]] does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as [[reverse osmosis]]. [[Desalination]] of abundant [[seawater]] is a more expensive solution used in coastal [[arid]] [[climate]]s.\n\nThe distribution of drinking water is done through [[municipal water system]]s, tanker delivery or as [[bottled water]]. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.\n\nReducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to [[Water conservation|conserve fresh water resources]].\n\n[[Water pollution|Polluting water]] may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as [[externality|externalities]] for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. [[Pharmaceuticals]] consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on [[marine biology|aquatic]] life if they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] and if they are not [[biodegradable]].\n\nMunicipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at [[wastewater treatment plant]]s. Mitigation of polluted [[surface runoff]] is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques. (''See'' [[Surface runoff#Mitigation and treatment]].)\n\n====Industrial applications====\nMany industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water, suspension of solids in water [[slurry|slurries]] or using water to dissolve and extract substances, or to wash products or process equipment. Processes such as [[mining]], [[chemical pulping]], [[pulp bleaching]], [[paper manufacturing]], textile production, dyeing, printing, and cooling of power plants use large amounts of water, requiring a dedicated water source, and often cause significant water pollution.\n\nWater is used in [[power generation]]. [[Hydroelectricity]] is electricity obtained from [[hydropower]]. Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.\n\n{{wide image|200407-sandouping-sanxiadaba-4.med.jpg|800px|[[Three Gorges Dam]] is the [[List of the largest hydroelectric power stations|largest hydro-electric power station]].}}\n\nPressurized water is used in [[Hydrodemolition|water blasting]] and [[water jet cutter]]s. Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting. It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.\n\nWater is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the [[steam turbine]] and [[heat exchanger]], in addition to its use as a chemical [[solvent]]. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is [[water pollution|pollution]]. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and discharged coolant water ([[thermal pollution]]). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.\n\n====Food processing====\n[[File:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|Water can be used to cook foods such as [[noodles]]]]\n\n[[Boiling]], [[steaming]], and [[simmering]] are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xZHUAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA54|title=A Course in Household Arts: Part I|last=Duff|first=Sister Loretto Basil|date=1916|publisher=Whitcomb & Barrows}}</ref> Water is also used for [[dishwashing]]. Water also plays many critical roles within the field of [[food science]].\n\n[[Solution|Solutes]] such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as [[air pressure]], which is in turn affected by altitude. Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations. One [[mole (unit)|mole]] of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by {{convert|0.51|C-change|3}}, and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by {{convert|1.02|C-change|3}}; similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point.<ref name=\"vaclacik\">{{cite book |title=Essentials of Food Science |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iCCsvwZrguUC&printsec=frontcover |year=2007 |author1=Vaclavik, Vickie A. |author2=Christian, Elizabeth W |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-69939-4}}</ref>\n\nSolutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food.<ref name=\"deman\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kDYJ7a1HbD0C&pg=PA434 |title=Principles of Food Chemistry |year=1999 |author=DeMan, John M |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-8342-1234-3}}</ref> Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water.<ref name=\"vaclacik\" /> Solutes in water lower water activity\u2014this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity.<ref name=\"deman\" /> Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.\n\n[[Water hardness]] is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system.

Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the [[International Water Management Institute]] of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken.

Faiths that incorporate ritual washing ([[Ritual purification|ablution]]) include [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Shinto]], [[Taoism]], and [[Wicca]]. Immersion (or [[aspersion]] or [[affusion]]) of a person in water is a central [[sacrament]] of Christianity (where it is called [[baptism]]); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (''[[Ghusl]]''), Judaism (''[[mikvah]]'') and [[Sikhism]] (''[[Amrit Sanskar]]''). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (''[[wudu]]''), unless water is unavailable (see ''[[Tayammum]]''). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of ''[[misogi]]'').\n\nIn Christianity, [[holy water]] is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of [[baptism]], the [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|blessing]] of persons, places, and objects, or as a means of repelling evil.<ref>''Chambers's encyclop\u00e6dia'', Lippincott & Co (1870). p. 394.</ref><ref>Altman, Nathaniel (2002) ''Sacred water: the spiritual source of life''. pp. 130\u2013133. {{ISBN|1-58768-013-0}}.</ref>\n\nIn [[Zoroastrianism]], water (''[[aban|\u0101b]]'') is respected as the source of life.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0100B i.

[[Thales]], who was portrayed by Aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from the water. Thales, a [[monist]], believed further that all things are made from water. Plato believed the shape of water is an [[icosahedron]] which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.<ref>Lindberg, D. (2008). ''The beginnings of western science: The European scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context, prehistory to A.D. 1450''. (2nd ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\nIn the theory of the [[humorism|four bodily humors]], water was associated with [[phlegm]], as being cold and moist. The [[Water (classical element)|classical element of water]] was also one of the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five elements]] in traditional [[Chinese philosophy]], along with [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[wood (classical element)|wood]], and [[metal (classical element)|metal]].\n\nWater is also taken as a role model in some parts of traditional and popular [[Asian philosophy]].

Specifically, at a standard pressure of 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]], water is a liquid between {{convert|0|and|100|C}}. Increasing the pressure slightly lowers the [[melting point]], which is about {{convert|-5|C}} at 600 atm and {{convert|-22|C}} at 2100 atm. This effect is relevant, for example, to [[ice skating]], to the [[Lake Vostok|buried lakes of Antarctica]], and to the movement of [[glacier]]s. At pressures higher than 2100 atm the melting point rapidly increases again, and ice takes several exotic forms that do not exist at lower pressures.\n\nIncreasing the pressure has a more dramatic effect on the [[boiling point]], that is about {{convert|374|C}} at 220 atm. This effect is important in, among other things, deep-sea [[hydrothermal vents]] and [[geyser]]s, [[pressure cooking]], and [[steam engine]] design. At the top of [[Mount Everest]], where the atmospheric pressure is about 0.34 atm, water boils at {{convert|68|C}}.\n\nAt very low pressures (below about 0.006 atm), water cannot exist in the liquid state and passes directly from solid to gas by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]\u2014a phenomenon exploited in the [[freeze drying]] of food. At very high pressures (above 221 atm), the liquid and gas states are no longer distinguishable, a state called [[supercritical fluid|supercritical steam]].\n\nWater also differs from most liquids in that it becomes less [[density|dense]] as it freezes. The maximum density of water in its liquid form (at 1&nbsp;atm) is {{convert|1000|kg/m3|lb/cuft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}}; that occurs at {{convert|3.98|\u00b0C}}.<ref name=\"NatureWaterStructure\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/2230441 |title=Water: Water\u2014an enduring mystery |access-date=15 November 2016 |journal=Nature |volume=452 |issue=7185 |pages=291\u20132 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117211552/http://www.academia.edu/2230441/Water_Water_an_enduring_mystery |archive-date=17 November 2016 |url-status=live  |bibcode=2008Natur.452..291B |last1=Ball |first1=Philip |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/452291a |pmid=18354466 }}</ref> The density of ice is {{convert|917|kg/m3|lb/cuft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kotz, J.C., Treichel, P., & Weaver, G.C. |year=2005 |title=Chemistry & Chemical Reactivity |publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |isbn=978-0-534-39597-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Ben-Naim |first=Ariel |display-authors=etal |title=Alice's Adventures in Water-land |year=2011 |location=Singapore |doi=10.1142/8068 |last2=Ben-Naim |first2=Roberta |isbn=978-981-4338-96-7}}</ref> Thus, water expands 9% in volume as it freezes, which accounts for the fact that ice floats on liquid water.\n\nThe details of the exact chemical nature of liquid water are not well understood; some theories suggest that the unusual behaviour of water is due to the existence of 2 liquid states.<ref name=\"NatureWaterStructure\" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Maestro |first=L.M. |last2=Marqu\u00e9s |first2=M.I. |last3=Camarillo |first3=E. |last4=Jaque |first4=D. |last5=Sol\u00e9 |first5=J.

They also explain its exceptionally high [[specific heat capacity]] (about 4.2 [[Joule|J]]/g/K), [[heat of fusion]] (about 333 J/g), [[heat of vaporization]] ({{nowrap|2257 J/g}}), and [[thermal conductivity]] (between 0.561 and 0.679 W/m/K). These properties make water more effective at moderating Earth's [[climate]], by storing heat and transporting it between the oceans and the atmosphere. The hydrogen bonds of water are of moderate strength, around 23 kJ/mol (compared to a covalent O-H bond at 492 kJ/mol).

The [[Antarctic ice sheet]], which contains 61% of all fresh water on Earth, is visible at the bottom. Condensed atmospheric water can be seen as clouds, contributing to the Earth's [[albedo]].]]\n\nHydrology is the study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth. The study of the distribution of water is [[hydrography]]. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is [[hydrogeology]], of glaciers is [[glaciology]], of inland waters is [[limnology]] and distribution of oceans is [[oceanography]]. Ecological processes with hydrology are in focus of [[ecohydrology]].\n\nThe collective mass of water found on, under, and over the surface of a planet is called the [[hydrosphere]]. Earth's approximate water volume (the total water supply of the world) is 1.386 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> cubic kilometers (3.33 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> cubic miles).<ref name=b1 />\n\nLiquid water is found in [[body of water|bodies of water]], such as an ocean, sea, lake, river, stream, [[canal]], pond, or [[puddle]]. The majority of water on Earth is [[sea water]]. Water is also present in the atmosphere in solid, liquid, and vapor states. It also exists as groundwater in [[aquifer]]s.\n\nWater is important in many geological processes. Groundwater is present in most [[rock (geology)|rocks]], and the pressure of this groundwater affects patterns of [[fault (geology)|faulting]]. Water in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] is responsible for the melt that produces [[volcano]]es at [[subduction zone]]s. On the surface of the Earth, water is important in both chemical and physical [[weathering]] processes. Water, and to a lesser but still significant extent, ice, are also responsible for a large amount of [[sediment transport]] that occurs on the surface of the earth. [[Deposition (geology)|Deposition]] of transported sediment forms many types of [[sedimentary rock]]s, which make up the [[geologic record]] of [[History of the Earth|Earth history]].\n\n===Water cycle===\n{{Main|Water cycle}}\n[[File:Water cycle.png|thumb|[[Water cycle]]]]\n\nThe [[water cycle]] (known scientifically as the hydrologic cycle) refers to the continuous exchange of water within the [[hydrosphere]], between the [[Earth atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[soil]] water, [[surface water]], [[groundwater]], and plants.\n\nWater moves perpetually through each of these regions in the ''water cycle'' consisting of the following transfer processes:\n* [[evaporation]] from oceans and other water bodies into the air and [[transpiration]] from land plants and animals into the air.\n* [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], from water vapor condensing from the air and falling to the earth or ocean.\n* [[runoff (water)|runoff]] from the land usually reaching the sea.\nMost water vapor over the oceans returns to the oceans, but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 47&nbsp;[[Metric tonne unit|Tt]] per year. Over land, evaporation and transpiration contribute another 72&nbsp;Tt per year. Precipitation, at a rate of 119 Tt per year over land, has several forms: most commonly rain, snow, and [[hail]], with some contribution from [[fog]] and [[dew]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Water in Crisis: A Guide to the World's Freshwater Resources |editor=Gleick, P.H. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |page=15, Table 2.3 |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&ci=9780195076288 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408091921/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&ci=9780195076288 |archivedate=8 April 2013  }}</ref> Dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface.

A mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a [[hydrological transport model]]. Some water is diverted to [[irrigation]] for agriculture. Rivers and seas offer opportunity for travel and commerce. Through [[erosion]], runoff shapes the environment creating river [[valley]]s and [[river delta|deltas]] which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers. A flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. It is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea. A drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply. This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation.\n\n===Fresh water storage===\n{{Main|Water resources}}\n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 1\n| total_width = 150\n| align = \n| direction = \n| width = \n| image1 = Bay of Fundy High Tide.jpg\n| width1 = \n| caption1 = \n| height1 = \n| image2 = Bay of Fundy Low Tide.jpg\n| width2 = \n| caption2 = \n| height2 = \n| footer = The [[Bay of Fundy]] at high tide and low tide.

The physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower temperature (about {{convert|-1.9|C}}) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the [[Baltic Sea]] to 4.0% in the [[Red Sea]]. (The [[Dead Sea]], known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30\u201340%, is really a [[salt lake]].)\n\n[[Tide]]s are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the [[tidal force]]s of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and [[estuary|estuarine]] water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams. The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the [[Coriolis effect|effects of Earth rotation]] and the local [[bathymetry]]. The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the [[intertidal zone]], is an important ecological product of ocean tides.\n\n==Effects on life==\n[[File:Oasis in Lybia.JPG|thumb|left|An [[oasis]] is an isolated [[water source]] with vegetation in a [[desert]].]]\n[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.svg|thumb|right|Overview of [[photosynthesis|<span style=\"color:green;\">photosynthesis (green)</span>]] and [[cellular respiration|<span style=\"color:red;\">respiration (red)</span>]]. Water (at right), together with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), form oxygen and organic compounds (at left), which can be respired to water and (CO<sub>2</sub>).]]\n\nFrom a [[biology|biological]] standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life. It carries out this role by allowing [[organic compound]]s to react in ways that ultimately allow [[Self-replication|replication]]. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a [[solvent]] in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of [[anabolism]] and [[catabolism]]. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g., starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g., glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.\n\nWater is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Hydrogen is combined with CO<sub>2</sub> (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO<sub>2</sub> in the process (cellular respiration).\n\nWater is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a [[pH]] (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. [[Acids]] have pH values less than 7 while [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] have values greater than 7.\n\n===Aquatic life forms===\n{{Further|Hydrobiology|Marine life|Aquatic plant}}\n[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright|Some of the [[biodiversity]] of a [[coral reef]]]]\n[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|Some marine [[diatom]]s \u2013 a key [[phytoplankton]] group]]\nEarth surface waters are filled with life. The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales. Some kinds of animals, such as [[amphibian]]s, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Plants such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]] is generally the foundation of the ocean [[food chain]].\n\nAquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways. Fish have [[gills]] instead of [[lungs]], although some species of fish, such as the [[lungfish]], have both. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as dolphins, whales, [[otter]]s, and [[pinniped|seals]] need to surface periodically to breathe air. Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see [[Siphon (insect)|insect]] and [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]]) and [[gills]] (''[[Carcinus]]''). However as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialization for respiration in water.\n\n==Effects on human civilization==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Longwood Gardens-Italian Garden.jpg|thumb|right|Water [[fountain]]]]\n\nCivilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; [[Mesopotamia]], the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]; the ancient society of the [[Egyptians]] depended entirely upon the [[Nile]]. Rome was also founded on the banks of the Italian river [[Tiber]]. Large [[metropolis]]es like [[Rotterdam]], London, Montreal, Paris, New York City, [[Buenos Aires]], Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago, and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade. Islands with safe water ports, like Singapore, have flourished for the same reason. In places such as North Africa and the Middle East, where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.\n\n===Health and pollution===\n[[File:Field Trip- water sampling.jpg|thumb|An environmental science program \u2013 a student from [[Iowa State University]] sampling water]]\nWater fit for human consumption is called [[drinking water]] or potable water. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or [[distillation]], or by a range of [[Water treatment|other methods]].\n\nWater that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called [[safe water]], or \"safe for bathing\". Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1\u20132 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as [[chlorine]] or [[ozone]] or by the use of [[ultraviolet]] light.\n\nIn the US, non-potable forms of [[wastewater]] generated by humans may be referred to as [[greywater]], which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], which generally contains [[sewage]] and other forms of waste which require [[Sewage treatment|further treatment]] in order to be made reusable. Greywater composes 50\u201380% of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment ([[sink]]s, showers and kitchen runoff, but not toilets, which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.\n\nThis natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability is a major social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. In 2000, the [[United Nations]] established the [[Millennium Development Goals]] for water to halve by 2015 the proportion of people worldwide without access to safe water and [[sanitation]]. Progress toward that goal was uneven, and in 2015 the UN committed to the following targets set by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] of achieving universal access to safe and affordable water and sanitation by 2030. Poor [[water quality]] and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by water-related diseases. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that [[safe water]] could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from [[diarrhea]] each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/qa/70/en/ |title=World Health Organization.

At the time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers.

It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of [[physical water scarcity]], where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing [[economic water scarcity]], where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.<ref>Chartres, C. and Varma, S.

Most of personal water use is due to [[shower]]ing, doing the [[laundry]] and [[dishwashing]], reaching hundreds of liters per day per person in developed countries.\n\n====Transportation====\n{{Main|Ship transport}}\nThe use of water for transportation of materials through rivers and canals as well as the international shipping lanes is an important part of the world economy.\n\n====Chemical uses====\nWater is widely used in chemical reactions as a [[solvent]] or [[reactant]] and less commonly as a [[solution|solute]] or [[catalyst]]. In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds, as well as other polar compounds such as [[ammonia]] and [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|compounds closely related to water]]. In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is [[amphoteric]] (acidic ''and'' basic) and [[nucleophilic]]. Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable. Also, acceleration of [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s by water has been observed. [[Supercritical water]] has recently been a topic of research. Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently. Water vapor is used for some processes in the chemical industry. An example is the production of acrylic acid from acrolein, propylene and propane.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The reaction network in propane oxidation over phase-pure MoVTeNb M1 oxide catalysts|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2014|volume=311|pages=369\u2013385|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2013.12.008|last1=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first1=Raoul|last2=Csepei|first2=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last3=H\u00e4vecker|first3=Michael|last4=Girgsdies|first4=Frank|last5=Schuster|first5=Manfred E|last6=Schl\u00f6gl|first6=Robert|last7=Trunschke|first7=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0014-F434-5|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215104605/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|archive-date=15 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Surface chemistry of phase-pure M1 MoVTeNb oxide during operation in selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2012|volume=285|pages=48\u201360|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2011.09.012|last1=H\u00e4vecker|first1=Michael|last2=Wrabetz|first2=Sabine|last3=Kr\u00f6hnert|first3=Jutta|last4=Csepei|first4=Lenard-Istvan|last5=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first5=Raoul|last6=Kolen'Ko|first6=Yury V|last7=Girgsdies|first7=Frank|last8=Schl\u00f6gl|first8=Robert|last9=Trunschke|first9=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-1BEB-F|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030003154/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Kinetic studies of propane oxidation on Mo and V based mixed oxide catalysts|date=2011|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220044522/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Multifunctionality of Crystalline MoV(TeNb) M1 Oxide Catalysts in Selective Oxidation of Propane and Benzyl Alcohol|journal=ACS Catalysis|date=2013|volume=3|issue=6|pages=1103\u20131113|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|doi=10.1021/cs400010q|last1=Amakawa|first1=Kazuhiko|last2=Kolen'Ko|first2=Yury V|last3=Villa|first3=Alberto|last4=Schuster|first4=Manfred E/|last5=Csepei|first5=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last6=Weinberg|first6=Gisela|last7=Wrabetz|first7=Sabine|last8=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first8=Raoul|last9=Girgsdies|first9=Frank|last10=Prati|first10=Laura|last11=Schl\u00f6gl|first11=Robert|last12=Trunschke|first12=Annette|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022030814/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|archive-date=22 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The possible effect of water in these reactions includes the physical-, chemical interaction of water with the catalyst and the chemical reaction of water with the reaction intermediates.\n\n====Heat exchange====\nWater and steam are a common fluid used for [[heat exchanger|heat exchange]], due to its availability and high [[Heat capacity of water|heat capacity]], both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through [[vaporization]] and [[condensation]] of water because of its large [[latent heat of vaporization]]. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are [[oxidation|oxidized]] faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all [[thermal power station]]s, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by [[evaporation]] in a [[cooling tower]]). In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.<ref name=\"Water Use in the United States\">[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html Water Use in the United States], National Atlas.gov  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814045418/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html |date=14 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[nuclear power]] industry, water can also be used as a [[neutron moderator]]. In most [[nuclear reactor]]s, water is both a coolant and a moderator. This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also [[void coefficient|slows the nuclear reaction down]]. However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.\n\n====Fire considerations====\n[[File:MH-60S Helicopter dumps water onto Fire.jpg|right|thumb|Water is used for [[fire fighting|fighting]] [[wildfire]]s.]]\nWater has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good [[Fire fighting#Use of water|fire extinguishing]] fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.\n\nUse of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a [[steam explosion]], which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal, [[charcoal]], or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] graphite, decompose the water, producing [[water gas]].\n\nThe power of such explosions was seen in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system. A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam. A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot [[zirconium]].\n\nSome metallic oxides, most notably those of [[alkali metals]] and [[alkaline earth metals]], produce so much heat on reaction with water that a fire hazard can develop. The alkaline earth oxide [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] is a mass-produced substance which is often transported in paper bags. If these are soaked through, they may ignite as their contents react with water.<ref>{{cite web |title=Material Safety Data Sheet: Quicklime |url=https://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |publisher=Lhoist North America |date=6 August 2012 |accessdate=24 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705030051/http://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |archive-date=5 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Recreation====\n{{Main|Water sport (recreation)}}\n[[File:Johny Cay.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Andr\u00e9s (island)|San Andr\u00e9s island]], [[Colombia]].]]\n\nHumans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports. Some of these include swimming, [[waterskiing]], [[boating]], [[surfing]] and [[Underwater diving|diving]]. In addition, some sports, like [[ice hockey]] and [[ice skating]], are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and [[water park]]s are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other life in [[aquarium]]s or ponds for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. [[skiing]], [[sledding]], [[snowmobiling]] or [[snowboarding]], which require the water to be frozen.\n\n====Water industry====\n[[File:Water carrier in India.jpg|thumb|upright|A water-carrier in India, 1882.

[[Water supply]] facilities include [[water well]]s, [[cistern]]s for [[rainwater harvesting]], [[water supply network]]s, and [[water purification]] facilities, [[water tank]]s, [[water tower]]s, [[water pipe]]s including old [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s are in development.\n\nDrinking water is often collected at [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], extracted from artificial [[Boring (earth)|borings]] (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful [[microbe]]s. Popular methods are [[filter (water)|filtering]] with sand which only removes undissolved material, while [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and [[boiling]] kill harmful microbes. [[Distillation]] does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as [[reverse osmosis]]. [[Desalination]] of abundant [[seawater]] is a more expensive solution used in coastal [[arid]] [[climate]]s.\n\nThe distribution of drinking water is done through [[municipal water system]]s, tanker delivery or as [[bottled water]]. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.\n\nReducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to [[Water conservation|conserve fresh water resources]].\n\n[[Water pollution|Polluting water]] may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as [[externality|externalities]] for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. [[Pharmaceuticals]] consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on [[marine biology|aquatic]] life if they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] and if they are not [[biodegradable]].\n\nMunicipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at [[wastewater treatment plant]]s. Mitigation of polluted [[surface runoff]] is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques. (''See'' [[Surface runoff#Mitigation and treatment]].)\n\n====Industrial applications====\nMany industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water, suspension of solids in water [[slurry|slurries]] or using water to dissolve and extract substances, or to wash products or process equipment. Processes such as [[mining]], [[chemical pulping]], [[pulp bleaching]], [[paper manufacturing]], textile production, dyeing, printing, and cooling of power plants use large amounts of water, requiring a dedicated water source, and often cause significant water pollution.\n\nWater is used in [[power generation]]. [[Hydroelectricity]] is electricity obtained from [[hydropower]]. Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.\n\n{{wide image|200407-sandouping-sanxiadaba-4.med.jpg|800px|[[Three Gorges Dam]] is the [[List of the largest hydroelectric power stations|largest hydro-electric power station]].}}\n\nPressurized water is used in [[Hydrodemolition|water blasting]] and [[water jet cutter]]s. Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting. It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.\n\nWater is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the [[steam turbine]] and [[heat exchanger]], in addition to its use as a chemical [[solvent]]. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is [[water pollution|pollution]]. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and discharged coolant water ([[thermal pollution]]). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.\n\n====Food processing====\n[[File:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|Water can be used to cook foods such as [[noodles]]]]\n\n[[Boiling]], [[steaming]], and [[simmering]] are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xZHUAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA54|title=A Course in Household Arts: Part I|last=Duff|first=Sister Loretto Basil|date=1916|publisher=Whitcomb & Barrows}}</ref> Water is also used for [[dishwashing]]. Water also plays many critical roles within the field of [[food science]].\n\n[[Solution|Solutes]] such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as [[air pressure]], which is in turn affected by altitude. Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations. One [[mole (unit)|mole]] of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by {{convert|0.51|C-change|3}}, and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by {{convert|1.02|C-change|3}}; similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point.<ref name=\"vaclacik\">{{cite book |title=Essentials of Food Science |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iCCsvwZrguUC&printsec=frontcover |year=2007 |author1=Vaclavik, Vickie A. |author2=Christian, Elizabeth W |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-69939-4}}</ref>\n\nSolutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food.<ref name=\"deman\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kDYJ7a1HbD0C&pg=PA434 |title=Principles of Food Chemistry |year=1999 |author=DeMan, John M |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-8342-1234-3}}</ref> Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water.<ref name=\"vaclacik\" /> Solutes in water lower water activity\u2014this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity.<ref name=\"deman\" /> Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.\n\n[[Water hardness]] is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system. It can dramatically affect the quality of a product, as well as playing a role in sanitation. Water hardness is classified based on concentration of calcium carbonate the water contains.

Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the [[International Water Management Institute]] of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken. They also discovered that Cambodia's draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx |title=Search Results |website=International Water Management Institute (IWMI) |accessdate=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605124732/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx |archive-date=5 June 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nThe [[UN World Water Development Report]] (WWDR, 2003) from the [[World Water Assessment Program]] indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal [[hygiene]]. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from [[waterborne diseases]] (related to the consumption of contaminated water) or drought. In 2004, the UK charity [[WaterAid]] reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases; often this means lack of [[sewage]] disposal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOrganizations concerned with water protection include the [[International Water Association]] (IWA), [[WaterAid]], [[Water 1st]], and the American Water Resources Association. The [[International Water Management Institute]] undertakes projects with the aim of using effective water management to reduce poverty. Water related conventions are [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD), [[International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships]], [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] and [[Ramsar Convention]].

Faiths that incorporate ritual washing ([[Ritual purification|ablution]]) include [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Shinto]], [[Taoism]], and [[Wicca]]. Immersion (or [[aspersion]] or [[affusion]]) of a person in water is a central [[sacrament]] of Christianity (where it is called [[baptism]]); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (''[[Ghusl]]''), Judaism (''[[mikvah]]'') and [[Sikhism]] (''[[Amrit Sanskar]]''). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (''[[wudu]]''), unless water is unavailable (see ''[[Tayammum]]''). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of ''[[misogi]]'').\n\nIn Christianity, [[holy water]] is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of [[baptism]], the [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|blessing]] of persons, places, and objects, or as a means of repelling evil.<ref>''Chambers's encyclop\u00e6dia'', Lippincott & Co (1870). p. 394.</ref><ref>Altman, Nathaniel (2002) ''Sacred water: the spiritual source of life''. pp. 130\u2013133. {{ISBN|1-58768-013-0}}.</ref>\n\nIn [[Zoroastrianism]], water (''[[aban|\u0101b]]'') is respected as the source of life.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0100B i.

[[Thales]], who was portrayed by Aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from the water. Thales, a [[monist]], believed further that all things are made from water. Plato believed the shape of water is an [[icosahedron]] which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.<ref>Lindberg, D. (2008). ''The beginnings of western science: The European scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context, prehistory to A.D. 1450''. (2nd ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\nIn the theory of the [[humorism|four bodily humors]], water was associated with [[phlegm]], as being cold and moist. The [[Water (classical element)|classical element of water]] was also one of the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five elements]] in traditional [[Chinese philosophy]], along with [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[wood (classical element)|wood]], and [[metal (classical element)|metal]].\n\nWater is also taken as a role model in some parts of traditional and popular [[Asian philosophy]]. [[James Legge]]'s 1891 translation of the ''[[Dao De Jing]]'' states, \"The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the [[Tao]]\" and \"There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it\u2014for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm |title=Internet Sacred Text Archive Home |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=25 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712103909/http://www.sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm |archive-date=12 July 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref> ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' in the \"Shui di\" \u6c34\u5730 chapter further elaborates on the symbolism of water, proclaiming that \"man is water\" and attributing natural qualities of the people of different Chinese regions to the character of local water resources.<ref>[http://ctext.org/guanzi/shui-di Guanzi : Shui Di \u2013 Chinese Text Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20141106133901/http://ctext.org/guanzi/shui-di |date=6 November 2014 }}.

During a stay at the hospital, Jeff realizes that he enjoys harming people, and goes insane. The night after he is discharged, he slices his face, leaving [[Glasgow smile|a scar in the shape of a smile]], and cuts off his eyelids, so that he will never sleep. He then murders his parents and brother, whispering \"go to sleep\" while killing his sibling. He becomes a [[serial killer]] who sneaks into houses at night and whispers \"go to sleep\" to his victims before killing them.

The story goes that if anyone receives the photo (either by email or by regular post), they have to send copies of it to their friends and family members (like a [[Chain Letter]]).

In the story, a teenage girl named Nina, who is a big fan of Jeff, undergoes the same unfortunate events that Jeff faced. She later burns her own face as a means to impress Jeff, turning her face white. Following her recovery at the hospital, she follows Jeff's path by slicing his face into a Glasgow smile and sewing her eyelids open.

She then momentarily passes out after coughing blood and after waking up again, the doctor informs her that she was never supposed to wake up and that her appearance had also changed from the botched surgery. Natalie looks into a mirror and quickly notices that her eyes had completely changed to a vibrant green. However, Natalie was surprisingly happy with her \u2018new look\u2019. After she had gone completely insane, she kills the doctor, along with two security guards, and escapes from the hospital. She returns back home through a thunderstorm and kills her family. She walks into the bathroom where she dissembles her father's pocket watch, removes her left eye, and forces the watch's clock face into her eye socket until it 'fits perfectly' and renames herself \u201cClockwork\u201d.

After waking up at a hospital, she removed the bandages on her face and discover that, unlike Jeff, her face is completely brown and ugly and there was no hair on her. She receives a package from Jeff, which contained a black dress, a mask with smiling lips and dark eyes, a wig, a knife, and a bouquet of black roses.

Simpson. It features the [[The Simpsons|Simpson family]] going on a plane trip together, but while being his usual, mischievous self, Bart ends up breaking a window on the plane and getting sucked out, falling to his death. After an apparently very realistic view of his corpse, the show's second act features a surreal take on the Simpson family's grief. Act three opens with a title card saying one year has passed. Homer, Marge, and Lisa are skeletally thin, and still sitting at the table. There is no sign of Maggie or the pets. They decide to visit Bart's grave. Springfield is completely deserted, and as they walk to the cemetery the houses become more and more decrepit. Emotionally abandoned, they arrive at Bart\u2019s grave where Bart's body is simply lying in front of his tombstone, appearing similarly to the corpse in act one. The family starts crying again, but eventually they stop and blankly stare at Bart's body. Near the end, the camera starts to zoom into Homer\u2019s face and according to summaries, Homer also tells a joke during this part.

The staff initially assumed it was just an office prank. In the firsthand account, the video consists of Squidward preparing for a concert. After Squidward finishes playing at the concert, the crowd jeers at Squidward. The next shows Squidward forlornly sitting on a bed, while strange and upsetting noises play and become louder in the background.

After being locked in a large room with several others, Rainbow Dash reveals how [[Rainbow|rainbows]], and therefore weather is made in Equestria, through the use of mutilated, live Pegasai being put through a machine that converts their corpses into individual colors (known as Strata), which are then mixed together to make rainbows.

Scootaloo attempts to escape from a now-maniacal and insane Rainbow Dash, but Scootaloo's attempts to escape are proven fruitless, as she is captured by guards and attached to the machine, where she utters her last words to Rainbow Dash \"You have beautiful eyes\", before it is implied that she is also murdered by the machine.

The game's graphics were very simple, with slow music based on [[Music of the Czech Republic|Czech]] folk songs. The two playable characters were named Porto and Ghast, with Porto being a human miner who could change her size, and Ghast being an invisible demon. As Ghast's invisibility made it impossible for the player to know where their character was, no one was ever able to complete the game as him. Porto's half of the story followed her escape from the mines in which she used to work, and discovering why the employees and machinery were now hostile. The game ends with the screen going white as Porto crawls out of the final tunnel, and the game then deletes itself from the player's computer. Only a limited number of copies were ever released, and Karvina Corporation stated that they never intended to release more of them. The story concludes that in 2005, a man named Yamamoto Ryuichi brought an unplayed copy of ''Killswitch'' for $733,000 and promised to record gameplay of it. Only a 1-minute and 45-second clip was ever found, and the video showed Yamamoto crying in front of the character select screen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025215536/http://invisiblegames.net/?p=11|title=Killswitch|last=Valente|first=Catherynne M.|date=25 October 2007|website=Invisible Games|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n===Lavender Town Syndrome===\n{{main|Lavender Town#Music and the Lavender Town Syndrome}}\nThis legend purports that, shortly after the original Japanese release of the video games [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Green'']] in 1996, there was an increase in the death rate amongst children aged 10\u201315.

The character who plays the game takes control of Steven on his journey to become a Pokemon master, only using an overpowered Charizard called Miki. Everything was mostly the same as in Pokemon Red, but Steven wouldn't go inside the tower at Lavender Town. At the end of Steven's journey, his brother, Mike, challenged him to a Pokemon conflict, and Steven won. The two brothers praised each other for their victory, but after Mike begged Steven to let him have Miki to register her into his Pokedex, the game crashes with a loud \"SNAP!\". Confused, the character loads the game again, but Steven no longer had any of his Pokemon, not even Miki. It is presumed she died in this scene. Over time, the character is forced to watch as Steven lets go of everything he had worked up to, uses a MissingNo. to resurrect his deceased Pokemon at night, and slowly go insane as he turns into a black hairy person with red eyes until the game finally ends.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDespite some minor spelling mistakes, this creepypasta was praised{{By whom|date=April 2020}} for being different to several other creepypastas, and is considered more sad than scary considering the upsetting story of the former Pokemon champion.

She then momentarily passes out after coughing blood and after waking up again, the doctor informs her that she was never supposed to wake up and that her appearance had also changed from the botched surgery. Natalie looks into a mirror and quickly notices that her eyes had completely changed to a vibrant green. However, Natalie was surprisingly happy with her \u2018new look\u2019. After she had gone completely insane, she kills the doctor, along with two security guards, and escapes from the hospital. She returns back home through a thunderstorm and kills her family.

After waking up at a hospital, she removed the bandages on her face and discover that, unlike Jeff, her face is completely brown and ugly and there was no hair on her. She receives a package from Jeff, which contained a black dress, a mask with smiling lips and dark eyes, a wig, a knife, and a bouquet of black roses.

After visiting her parent's graves, she now desires to seek revenge on Jeff and changes her name to Jane Everlasting.

Simpson. It features the [[The Simpsons|Simpson family]] going on a plane trip together, but while being his usual, mischievous self, Bart ends up breaking a window on the plane and getting sucked out, falling to his death. After an apparently very realistic view of his corpse, the show's second act features a surreal take on the Simpson family's grief. Act three opens with a title card saying one year has passed. Homer, Marge, and Lisa are skeletally thin, and still sitting at the table. There is no sign of Maggie or the pets. They decide to visit Bart's grave. Springfield is completely deserted, and as they walk to the cemetery the houses become more and more decrepit. Emotionally abandoned, they arrive at Bart\u2019s grave where Bart's body is simply lying in front of his tombstone, appearing similarly to the corpse in act one. The family starts crying again, but eventually they stop and blankly stare at Bart's body. Near the end, the camera starts to zoom into Homer\u2019s face and according to summaries, Homer also tells a joke during this part.

The student and some other coworkers received a tape to edit titled \"[[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]]\u2019s Suicide\" for the series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. The staff initially assumed it was just an office prank. In the firsthand account, the video consists of Squidward preparing for a concert. After Squidward finishes playing at the concert, the crowd jeers at Squidward. The next shows Squidward forlornly sitting on a bed, while strange and upsetting noises play and become louder in the background. The scene is spliced with quick flashes of murdered children, each time the noises getting louder when cutting back to Squidward \u2014 now bearing red 'hyper realistic' eyes. Eventually, Squidward shoots himself after a detached, deep voice commands it, and the video ends.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.geek.com/geek-cetera/the-scariest-most-believable-stories-on-the-internet-1574772/|title=The 4 scariest, most believable stories on the internet - Geek.com|last=Plafke|first=James|date=31 October 2013|work=Geek.com|access-date=2 December 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe circulated image of red-eyed Squidward associated with this creepypasta was referenced in the series and included in the original airing of the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 12)|season 12]] episode \"SpongeBob in RandomLand.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.avclub.com/yep-spongebob-just-directly-referenced-a-classic-creep-1838314120|title=Yep, SpongeBob just directly referenced a classic creepypasta about Squidward killing himself|last=Hughes|first=William|date=21 September 2019|work=The AV Club|access-date=22 September 2019|language=en-US}}</ref> The scene was later replaced with baby Squidward filling his diaper.\n\n===Happy Appy===\n\nThe creepypasta revolves around a lost Nick.

As the blogger progresses into the show, the episodes get more disturbing and morbid with one episode resembling the events of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks.]] After watching the first ten episodes, the blogger is stalked by a creature named \"Forensik\" as Yakovlev discovers and learns about the dark truth of the show.\n\n==Fanfictions==\nWhile the following stories do not fit the typical definition of creepypastas - often being written from an in-universe perspective, they are sometimes associated with the genre:\n\n===Rainbow Factory===\nCreated by internet user Aurora Dawn, \"Rainbow Factory\" is a fanfiction of [[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]] that tells the story of two [[Pegasus|Pegasai]], Scootaloo, and Orion, two residents of Cloudsdale, who fail a flight test due to trying to help another Pegasus who broke their wing while flying, being transferred to a large factory that is owned by Rainbow Dash. After being locked in a large room with several others, Rainbow Dash reveals how [[Rainbow|rainbows]], and therefore weather is made in Equestria, through the use of mutilated, live Pegasai being put through a machine that converts their corpses into individual colors (known as Strata), which are then mixed together to make rainbows. After attempting to retaliate against Rainbow Dash and the cruelty in the factory, Orion is chained up to the machine and has his limbs dislocated and his ribs shattered, before being tossed in. Scootaloo attempts to escape from a now-maniacal and insane Rainbow Dash, but Scootaloo's attempts to escape are proven fruitless, as she is captured by guards and attached to the machine, where she utters her last words to Rainbow Dash \"You have beautiful eyes\", before it is implied that she is also murdered by the machine.

The game's graphics were very simple, with slow music based on [[Music of the Czech Republic|Czech]] folk songs. The two playable characters were named Porto and Ghast, with Porto being a human miner who could change her size, and Ghast being an invisible demon. As Ghast's invisibility made it impossible for the player to know where their character was, no one was ever able to complete the game as him. Porto's half of the story followed her escape from the mines in which she used to work, and discovering why the employees and machinery were now hostile. The game ends with the screen going white as Porto crawls out of the final tunnel, and the game then deletes itself from the player's computer. Only a limited number of copies were ever released, and Karvina Corporation stated that they never intended to release more of them. The story concludes that in 2005, a man named Yamamoto Ryuichi brought an unplayed copy of ''Killswitch'' for $733,000 and promised to record gameplay of it. Only a 1-minute and 45-second clip was ever found, and the video showed Yamamoto crying in front of the character select screen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025215536/http://invisiblegames.net/?p=11|title=Killswitch|last=Valente|first=Catherynne M.|date=25 October 2007|website=Invisible Games|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n===Lavender Town Syndrome===\n{{main|Lavender Town#Music and the Lavender Town Syndrome}}\nThis legend purports that, shortly after the original Japanese release of the video games [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Green'']] in 1996, there was an increase in the death rate amongst children aged 10\u201315.

As the mystery behind the nature of Red unravels, it is revealed that the demon has closer ties to Zach than he ever could have expected.

At the end of Steven's journey, his brother, Mike, challenged him to a Pokemon conflict, and Steven won. The two brothers praised each other for their victory, but after Mike begged Steven to let him have Miki to register her into his Pokedex, the game crashes with a loud \"SNAP!\". Confused, the character loads the game again, but Steven no longer had any of his Pokemon, not even Miki. It is presumed she died in this scene. Over time, the character is forced to watch as Steven lets go of everything he had worked up to, uses a MissingNo. to resurrect his deceased Pokemon at night, and slowly go insane as he turns into a black hairy person with red eyes until the game finally ends.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDespite some minor spelling mistakes, this creepypasta was praised{{By whom|date=April 2020}} for being different to several other creepypastas, and is considered more sad than scary considering the upsetting story of the former Pokemon champion.

The film follows an underappreciated boxing trainer, the mistakes that haunt him from his past, and his quest for atonement by helping an underdog amateur boxer achieve her dream of becoming a professional.\n\n''Million Dollar Baby'' opened to widespread acclaim from critics, and won four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Swank. Its screenplay was written by [[Paul Haggis]], based on short stories by [[F.X. Toole]], the pen name of fight manager and [[cutman]] Jerry Boyd. Originally published under the title ''Rope Burns'', the stories have since been republished under the film's title.\n\n==Plot==\nMargaret \"Maggie\" Fitzgerald ([[Hilary Swank]]), a waitress from a [[Missouri]] town in the [[Ozarks]], shows up in the Hit Pit, a run-down [[Los Angeles]] gym owned and operated by Frankie Dunn ([[Clint Eastwood]]), an old, cantankerous boxing trainer. Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he initially refuses. Maggie works out tirelessly each day in his gym, even after Frankie tells her she's \"too old\" to begin a boxing career at her age. Eddie \"Scrap-Iron\" Dupris ([[Morgan Freeman]]), Frankie's friend and employee\u2014and the film's narrator\u2014encourages and helps her.\n\nFrankie's prize prospect, \"Big Willie\" Little, signs with successful manager Mickey Mack after becoming impatient with Frankie rejecting offers for a championship bout. With prodding from Scrap and impressed with her persistence, Frankie reluctantly agrees to train Maggie. He warns her that he will teach her only the basics and then find her a manager. Other than Maggie and his employees, the only person Frankie has contact with is a local priest, with whom he spars verbally at daily [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]].\n\nBefore her first fight, Frankie leaves Maggie with a random manager in his gym, much to her dismay; upon being told by Scrap that said manager deliberately put her up against his best girl (coaching the novice to lose) to give her an easy win, Frankie rejoins Maggie in the middle of the bout and coaches her instead to an unforeseen victory. A natural, she fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division with Frankie's coaching, winning many of her [[lightweight]] bouts with first-round knockouts. Since Maggie has earned a reputation for her [[Knockout|KOs]], Frankie must resort to bribery to get other managers to put their trainee fighters up against her.\n\nEventually, Frankie takes a risk by putting her in the junior [[welterweight]] class, where her nose is broken in her first match. Frankie comes to establish a paternal bond with Maggie, who substitutes for his estranged daughter. Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for her with Mickey Mack at a diner on her 33rd birthday. Out of loyalty, she declines. Frankie begrudgingly accepts a fight for her against a top-ranked opponent in the UK, where he bestows a [[Irish language|Gaelic]] nickname on her. The two travel to Europe as she continues to win; Maggie eventually saves up enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house, but her mother berates Maggie for endangering her government aid, claiming that everyone back home is laughing at her.\n\nFrankie is finally willing to arrange a title fight. He secures Maggie a $1 million match in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], against the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] women's welterweight champion, Billie \"The Blue Bear\" Osterman, a German ex-prostitute who has a reputation as an unpunished dirty fighter. Overcoming a shaky start, Maggie begins to dominate the fight, but Billie knocks her out with an illegal [[sucker punch]] from behind after the bell rings to end the round. Before Frankie can pull the corner stool out of the way (which was inappropriately placed on its side by Frankie's assistant), Maggie lands hard on it, breaking her neck and leaving her a ventilator-dependent [[Tetraplegia|quadriplegic]].\n\nFrankie is shown experiencing the first three of [[K\u00fcbler-Ross model|the five stages of grief]]: first seeking multiple doctors' opinions in denial, then blaming Scrap in anger, and later trying to bargain with God through prayer.\n\nIn a medical rehabilitation facility, Maggie looks forward to a visit from her family, but they arrive accompanied by an attorney; their only concern is to transfer Maggie's assets to them. She orders them to leave, threatening to sell the house and inform the [[IRS]] of her mother's [[welfare fraud]] if they ever show their faces again.\n\nAs the days pass, Maggie develops [[bedsore]]s and undergoes an [[amputation]] for an infected leg. She asks a favor of Frankie: to [[Euthanasia|help her die]], declaring that she got everything she wanted out of life. A horrified Frankie refuses, and Maggie later bites her tongue repeatedly in an attempt to bleed to death, but the medical staff saves her and takes measures to prevent further suicide attempts. The priest Frankie has harassed for 23 years, Father Horvak, warns him that he would never find himself again if he were to go through with Maggie's wishes.\n\nFrankie sneaks into the hospital one night, unaware that Scrap is watching from the shadows. Just before administering a fatal injection of [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]], he finally tells Maggie the meaning of a nickname he gave her, [[Macushla|''Mo Chuisle'']] (misspelled in the film as \"mo cuishle\"): [[Irish language|Irish]] for \"my darling, and my blood\" (literally, \"my pulse\"). He never returns to the gym. Scrap's narration is revealed to be a letter to Frankie's daughter, informing her of her father's true character. The last shot of the film shows Frankie sitting at the counter of a diner where Maggie once took him, and after having a homemade lemon meringue pie with her, said: \"Now I can die and go to heaven.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Frankie Dunn, a gruff but well-meaning elderly boxing trainer.\n* [[Hilary Swank]] as Mary Margaret \"Maggie\" Fitzgerald, a determined, aspiring boxer trained up by Frankie Dunn.\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Eddie \"Scrap-Iron\" Dupris, Dunn's gym assistant; an elderly former boxer, he was blinded in one eye in his 109th, and last, fight.\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Dangerous Dillard Fighting Flippo Bam-Bam Barch or \"Danger\", a simpleton would-be boxer.\n* [[Mike Colter]] as \"Big\" Willie Little, a boxer whom Dunn has trained for years.\n* [[Lucia Rijker]] as Billie \"The Blue Bear\" Osterman, a former sex worker and vicious boxer.\n* [[Br\u00edan F. O'Byrne]] as Father Horvak, the priest of the church which Dunn attends, who cannot stand Dunn.\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as Shawrelle Berry, an overzealous boxer and frequent tenant of Dunn's gym.\n* [[Margo Martindale]] as Earline Fitzgerald, Maggie's selfish mother.\n* [[Riki Lindhome]] as Mardell Fitzgerald, Maggie's welfare-cheating sister.\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Omar, a boxer and Shawrelle's best friend.\n* [[Benito Martinez (actor)|Benito Martinez]] as Billie's manager.\n* [[Grant L. Roberts]] as Billie's cut man, (trainer) trained Hilary Swank off screen for her Academy Award-winning role.\n* Bruce MacVittie as Mickey Mack, a rival of Dunn.\n* David Powledge as Counterman at Diner.\n* Joe D'Angerio as Cut Man.\n* Aaron Stretch as Himself.\n* Don Familton as Ring Announcer.\n\n==Development and production==\nThe film was stuck in [[development hell]] for years before it was shot. Several studios rejected the project even when Eastwood signed on as actor and director. Even Warner Bros., Eastwood's longtime home base, would not agree to a [[United States dollar|US$]]30 million budget. Eastwood persuaded Lakeshore Entertainment's Tom Rosenberg to put up half the budget (as well as handle foreign distribution), with Warner Bros. contributing the rest ($15 million). Eastwood shot the film in less than 40 days between June and July 2004.<ref name=\"Eliot309\"/><ref name=\"Hughes156\"/> Filming took place in Los Angeles and film sets at Warner Bros. Studios.<ref name=\"Hughes156\"/> The term 'Million Dollar Baby' was from the [[nose art]] of a [[World War II]] [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] heavy bomber. Eastwood had his daughter Morgan Colette appear in a brief role as a girl who waves to Swank's character at a gas station.<ref name=\"Hughes157\">Hughes, p. 157</ref><ref>Fold 3 WWII Crew photos</ref>\n\nEastwood had confidence in Swank's acting background, but upon seeing Swank's small physique, he had concerns, \"I just thought, 'Yeah, this gal would be great. If we can get her trained up. If we can get a little bit more bulk on her, to make her look like a fighter'...She was like a feather. But what happened is, she had this great work ethic.\"<ref name=cbs1>{{cite web|author=Rebecca Leung |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/02/60II/main677647.shtml |title=Hilary Swank: Oscar Gold \u2013 60 Minutes |publisher=CBS News |date=March 2, 2005 |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nConsequently, to prepare for her role, Swank underwent extensive training in the ring and weight room, gaining 19 pounds of muscle, aided by professional trainer [[Grant L Roberts]]. She trained for nearly five hours every day, winding up with a potentially life-threatening [[staphylococcus]] infection. She did not tell Eastwood about the infection because she thought it would be out of character for Maggie.<ref name=cbs1/>\n\n==Box office==\n''Million Dollar Baby'' initially had a [[limited release]], opening in eight theaters in December 2004.<ref name=\"Hughes160\">Hughes, p. 160</ref> In its later [[wide release]] opening, the film earned $12,265,482 in North America and quickly became a box-office hit both domestically and internationally. It grossed $216,763,646 in theaters; $100,492,203 in the United States, and $116,271,443 overseas.

It holds a 91% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 268 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10.

[[Wesley J. Smith]] in ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' also criticized the film for its ending and for missed opportunities; Smith said, \"The movie could have ended with Maggie triumphing once again, perhaps having obtained an education and becoming a teacher; or, opening a business managing boxers; or perhaps, receiving a standing ovation as an inspirational speaker.\"\n\nEastwood responded to the criticism by saying the film was about the [[American dream]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/13/arts/how-dirty-harry-turned-commie.html|title=How Dirty Harry Turned Commie|first=Frank|last=Rich|date=February 13, 2005|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> In an interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Eastwood distanced himself from the actions of characters in his films, noting, \"I've gone around in movies [[Dirty Harry (film series)|blowing people away with a]] [[.44 Magnum]].

The film follows an underappreciated boxing trainer, the mistakes that haunt him from his past, and his quest for atonement by helping an underdog amateur boxer achieve her dream of becoming a professional.\n\n''Million Dollar Baby'' opened to widespread acclaim from critics, and won four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Swank. Its screenplay was written by [[Paul Haggis]], based on short stories by [[F.X. Toole]], the pen name of fight manager and [[cutman]] Jerry Boyd. Originally published under the title ''Rope Burns'', the stories have since been republished under the film's title.\n\n==Plot==\nMargaret \"Maggie\" Fitzgerald ([[Hilary Swank]]), a waitress from a [[Missouri]] town in the [[Ozarks]], shows up in the Hit Pit, a run-down [[Los Angeles]] gym owned and operated by Frankie Dunn ([[Clint Eastwood]]), an old, cantankerous boxing trainer. Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he initially refuses. Maggie works out tirelessly each day in his gym, even after Frankie tells her she's \"too old\" to begin a boxing career at her age. Eddie \"Scrap-Iron\" Dupris ([[Morgan Freeman]]), Frankie's friend and employee\u2014and the film's narrator\u2014encourages and helps her.\n\nFrankie's prize prospect, \"Big Willie\" Little, signs with successful manager Mickey Mack after becoming impatient with Frankie rejecting offers for a championship bout. With prodding from Scrap and impressed with her persistence, Frankie reluctantly agrees to train Maggie. He warns her that he will teach her only the basics and then find her a manager. Other than Maggie and his employees, the only person Frankie has contact with is a local priest, with whom he spars verbally at daily [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]].\n\nBefore her first fight, Frankie leaves Maggie with a random manager in his gym, much to her dismay; upon being told by Scrap that said manager deliberately put her up against his best girl (coaching the novice to lose) to give her an easy win, Frankie rejoins Maggie in the middle of the bout and coaches her instead to an unforeseen victory. A natural, she fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division with Frankie's coaching, winning many of her [[lightweight]] bouts with first-round knockouts. Since Maggie has earned a reputation for her [[Knockout|KOs]], Frankie must resort to bribery to get other managers to put their trainee fighters up against her.\n\nEventually, Frankie takes a risk by putting her in the junior [[welterweight]] class, where her nose is broken in her first match. Frankie comes to establish a paternal bond with Maggie, who substitutes for his estranged daughter. Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for her with Mickey Mack at a diner on her 33rd birthday. Out of loyalty, she declines. Frankie begrudgingly accepts a fight for her against a top-ranked opponent in the UK, where he bestows a [[Irish language|Gaelic]] nickname on her. The two travel to Europe as she continues to win; Maggie eventually saves up enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house, but her mother berates Maggie for endangering her government aid, claiming that everyone back home is laughing at her.\n\nFrankie is finally willing to arrange a title fight. He secures Maggie a $1 million match in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], against the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] women's welterweight champion, Billie \"The Blue Bear\" Osterman, a German ex-prostitute who has a reputation as an unpunished dirty fighter. Overcoming a shaky start, Maggie begins to dominate the fight, but Billie knocks her out with an illegal [[sucker punch]] from behind after the bell rings to end the round. Before Frankie can pull the corner stool out of the way (which was inappropriately placed on its side by Frankie's assistant), Maggie lands hard on it, breaking her neck and leaving her a ventilator-dependent [[Tetraplegia|quadriplegic]].\n\nFrankie is shown experiencing the first three of [[K\u00fcbler-Ross model|the five stages of grief]]: first seeking multiple doctors' opinions in denial, then blaming Scrap in anger, and later trying to bargain with God through prayer.\n\nIn a medical rehabilitation facility, Maggie looks forward to a visit from her family, but they arrive accompanied by an attorney; their only concern is to transfer Maggie's assets to them. She orders them to leave, threatening to sell the house and inform the [[IRS]] of her mother's [[welfare fraud]] if they ever show their faces again.\n\nAs the days pass, Maggie develops [[bedsore]]s and undergoes an [[amputation]] for an infected leg. She asks a favor of Frankie: to [[Euthanasia|help her die]], declaring that she got everything she wanted out of life. A horrified Frankie refuses, and Maggie later bites her tongue repeatedly in an attempt to bleed to death, but the medical staff saves her and takes measures to prevent further suicide attempts. The priest Frankie has harassed for 23 years, Father Horvak, warns him that he would never find himself again if he were to go through with Maggie's wishes.\n\nFrankie sneaks into the hospital one night, unaware that Scrap is watching from the shadows. Just before administering a fatal injection of [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]], he finally tells Maggie the meaning of a nickname he gave her, [[Macushla|''Mo Chuisle'']] (misspelled in the film as \"mo cuishle\"): [[Irish language|Irish]] for \"my darling, and my blood\" (literally, \"my pulse\"). He never returns to the gym. Scrap's narration is revealed to be a letter to Frankie's daughter, informing her of her father's true character. The last shot of the film shows Frankie sitting at the counter of a diner where Maggie once took him, and after having a homemade lemon meringue pie with her, said: \"Now I can die and go to heaven.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Frankie Dunn, a gruff but well-meaning elderly boxing trainer.\n* [[Hilary Swank]] as Mary Margaret \"Maggie\" Fitzgerald, a determined, aspiring boxer trained up by Frankie Dunn.\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Eddie \"Scrap-Iron\" Dupris, Dunn's gym assistant; an elderly former boxer, he was blinded in one eye in his 109th, and last, fight.\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Dangerous Dillard Fighting Flippo Bam-Bam Barch or \"Danger\", a simpleton would-be boxer.\n* [[Mike Colter]] as \"Big\" Willie Little, a boxer whom Dunn has trained for years.\n* [[Lucia Rijker]] as Billie \"The Blue Bear\" Osterman, a former sex worker and vicious boxer.\n* [[Br\u00edan F.

Several studios rejected the project even when Eastwood signed on as actor and director. Even Warner Bros., Eastwood's longtime home base, would not agree to a [[United States dollar|US$]]30 million budget. Eastwood persuaded Lakeshore Entertainment's Tom Rosenberg to put up half the budget (as well as handle foreign distribution), with Warner Bros. contributing the rest ($15 million). Eastwood shot the film in less than 40 days between June and July 2004.<ref name=\"Eliot309\"/><ref name=\"Hughes156\"/> Filming took place in Los Angeles and film sets at Warner Bros. Studios.<ref name=\"Hughes156\"/> The term 'Million Dollar Baby' was from the [[nose art]] of a [[World War II]] [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] heavy bomber. Eastwood had his daughter Morgan Colette appear in a brief role as a girl who waves to Swank's character at a gas station.<ref name=\"Hughes157\">Hughes, p. 157</ref><ref>Fold 3 WWII Crew photos</ref>\n\nEastwood had confidence in Swank's acting background, but upon seeing Swank's small physique, he had concerns, \"I just thought, 'Yeah, this gal would be great. If we can get her trained up. If we can get a little bit more bulk on her, to make her look like a fighter'...She was like a feather. But what happened is, she had this great work ethic.\"<ref name=cbs1>{{cite web|author=Rebecca Leung |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/02/60II/main677647.shtml |title=Hilary Swank: Oscar Gold \u2013 60 Minutes |publisher=CBS News |date=March 2, 2005 |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nConsequently, to prepare for her role, Swank underwent extensive training in the ring and weight room, gaining 19 pounds of muscle, aided by professional trainer [[Grant L Roberts]]. She trained for nearly five hours every day, winding up with a potentially life-threatening [[staphylococcus]] infection. She did not tell Eastwood about the infection because she thought it would be out of character for Maggie.<ref name=cbs1/>\n\n==Box office==\n''Million Dollar Baby'' initially had a [[limited release]], opening in eight theaters in December 2004.<ref name=\"Hughes160\">Hughes, p. 160</ref> In its later [[wide release]] opening, the film earned $12,265,482 in North America and quickly became a box-office hit both domestically and internationally. It grossed $216,763,646 in theaters; $100,492,203 in the United States, and $116,271,443 overseas.

It holds a 91% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 268 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10.

[[Wesley J. Smith]] in ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' also criticized the film for its ending and for missed opportunities; Smith said, \"The movie could have ended with Maggie triumphing once again, perhaps having obtained an education and becoming a teacher; or, opening a business managing boxers; or perhaps, receiving a standing ovation as an inspirational speaker.\"\n\nEastwood responded to the criticism by saying the film was about the [[American dream]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/13/arts/how-dirty-harry-turned-commie.html|title=How Dirty Harry Turned Commie|first=Frank|last=Rich|date=February 13, 2005|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> In an interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Eastwood distanced himself from the actions of characters in his films, noting, \"I've gone around in movies [[Dirty Harry (film series)|blowing people away with a]] [[.44 Magnum]].

The top nine are all political leaders and royals, including Morocco's King Mohammed VI and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.<ref name=\"alarabiya\">{{cite news |last=Ansari|first=Saffiya|url=http://www.english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/features/2014/10/03/Politics-to-pop-royalty-World-s-500-influential-Muslims-unveiled.html|title=Politics to pop royalty: World's 500 influential Muslims unveiled|work= |location= |publisher=Al Arabiya News|date=October 3, 2014|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe top 50 fit into six broad categories: 12 are political leaders (kings, generals, presidents), four are spiritual leaders (Sufi shaykhs), 14 are national or international religious authorities, three are \"preachers\", six are high-level scholars, 11 are leaders of movements or organizations.

The top five, was King Abdullah of Jordan; Ahmed el-Tayeb, the grand sheikh of Egypt's Al-Azhar University; [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman]] of Saudi Arabia; Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; and King Mohammed VI of Morocco. Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan came in at Number eight, but surprisingly Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]] did not make the Top 50 this year or last, though he is still listed in the 500.
