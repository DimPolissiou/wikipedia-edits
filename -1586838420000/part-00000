Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education|Swann]]'' decision, which supported busing programs to integrate school districts to remedy ''[[de jure]]'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]], but opposed it to remedy ''[[de facto]]'' segregation, as in Delaware. He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses. In May, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] (R-MI) attempted to revive an amended version of the amendment. Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]] (R-PA) and Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) offered to leave the text of Griffin's amendment intact but add the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing. Biden and anti-busing senators wanted to limit the scope of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI\u2014nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with respect to the federal government's power to enforce school integration policies.<ref name=\"Gadsen\" /> After 1975, Biden took a harsher line on further legislative action to limit busing.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> That year, Helms proposed an anti-integration amendment to an education bill that would stop the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) from collecting data about students' or teachers' races and thereby prevent it from defunding districts that refused to integrate. Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education|Swann]]'' decision, which supported busing programs to integrate school districts to remedy ''[[de jure]]'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]], but opposed it to remedy ''[[de facto]]'' segregation, as in Delaware. He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses. In May, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] (R-MI) attempted to revive an amended version of the amendment. Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]] (R-PA) and Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) offered to leave the text of Griffin's amendment intact but add the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing. Biden and anti-busing senators wanted to limit the scope of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI\u2014nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with respect to the federal government's power to enforce school integration policies.<ref name=\"Gadsen\" /> After 1975, Biden took a harsher line on further legislative action to limit busing.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> That year, Helms proposed an anti-integration amendment to an education bill that would stop the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) from collecting data about students' or teachers' races and thereby prevent it from defunding districts that refused to integrate. Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

Thus the total number of unique strands, called the sequence space, is 4<sup>N</sup> where ''N'' denotes the number of bases in the random region. Because 4<sup>25</sup> \u2248 10<sup>15</sup>, there is no practical reason to choose random regions of less than 25 bases in length, while going above this number of bases means that the total sequence space cannot be surveyed. However, since there are likely many potential candidates for a given catalytic reaction within the sequence space, random regions of 50 and even higher have successfully yielded catalytic deoxyribozymes.<ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" />\n\nThe pool is first subjected to a selection step, during which the catalytic strands are separated from the non-catalytic strands. The exact separation method will depend on the reaction being catalyzed. As an example, the separation step for ribonucleotide cleavage often utilizes [[affinity chromatography]], in which a [[Protein tag|biological tag]] attached to each DNA strand is removed from any catalytically active strands via cleavage of a ribonucleotide base. This allows the catalytic strands to be separated by a column that specifically binds the tag, since the non-active strands will remain bound to the column while the active strands (which no longer possess the tag) flow through. A common set-up for this is a [[biotin]] tag with a [[streptavidin]] affinity column.<ref name=\"Joyce_2004\" /><ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> [[Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids|Gel electrophoresis]] based separation can also be used in which the change in molecular weight of strands upon the cleavage reaction is enough to cause a shift in the location of the reactive strands on the gel.<ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> After the selection step, the reactive pool is amplified via [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) to regenerate and amplify the reactive strands, and the process is repeated until a pool of sufficient reactivity is obtained. Multiple rounds of selection are required because some non-catalytic strands will inevitably make it through any single selection step. Usually 4\u201310 rounds are required for unambiguous catalytic activity,<ref name=\"Silverman_2005\" /> though more rounds are often necessary for more stringent catalytic conditions. After a sufficient number of rounds, the final pool is sequenced and the individual strands are tested for their catalytic activity.<ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> The dynamics of the pool can be described through mathematical modeling\n<ref name=\"Spill_2016\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Spill F, Weinstein ZB, Irani Shemirani A, Ho N, Desai D, Zaman MH | title = Controlling uncertainty in aptamer selection | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 113 | issue = 43 | pages = 12076\u201312081 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27790993 | pmc = 5087011 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1605086113 }}\n</ref>\n, which shows how oligonucleotides undergo competitive binding with the targets and how the evolutionary outcome can be improved through fine tuning of parameters.\n\nDeoxyribozymes obtained through ''in vitro'' selection will be optimized for the conditions during the selection, such as [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] concentration, [[pH]], and the presence of [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]]. Because of this, catalytic activity only in the presence of specific cofactors or other conditions can be achieved using positive selection steps, as well as negative selection steps against other undesired conditions.\n\n===''in vitro'' evolution===\nA similar method of obtaining new deoxyribozymes is through ''in vitro'' evolution. Though this term is often used interchangeably with ''in vitro'' selection, ''in vitro'' evolution more appropriately refers to a slightly different procedure in which the initial oligonucleotide pool is genetically altered over subsequent rounds through [[genetic recombination]] or through [[point mutation]]s.<ref name=\"Joyce_2004\" /><ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> For point mutations, the pool can be amplified using [[error-prone PCR]] to produce many different strands of various random, single mutations. As with ''in vitro'' selection, the evolved strands with increased activity will tend to dominate the pool after multiple selection steps, and once a sufficient catalytic activity is reached, the pool can be sequenced to identify the most active strands.\n\nThe initial pool for ''in vitro'' evolution can be derived from a narrowed subset of sequence space, such as a certain round of an ''in vitro'' selection experiment, which is sometimes also called ''in vitro'' reselection.<ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> The initial pool can also be derived from amplification of a single oligonucleotide strand. As an example of the latter, a recent study showed that a functional deoxyribozyme can be selected through ''in vitro'' evolution of a non-catalytic oligonucleotide precursor strand. An arbitrarily chosen DNA fragment derived from the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA transcript]] of [[bovine serum albumin]] was evolved through random point mutations over 25 rounds of selection. Through [[deep sequencing]] analysis of various pool generations, the evolution of the most catalytic deoxyribozyme strand could be tracked through each subsequent single mutation.<ref name=\"Gysbers\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gysbers R, Tram K, Gu J, Li Y | title = Evolution of an Enzyme from a Noncatalytic Nucleic Acid Sequence | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | pages = 11405 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26091540 | pmc = 4473686 | doi = 10.1038/srep11405 }}</ref>\nThis first successful evolution of catalytic DNA from a non-catalytic precursor could provide support for the [[RNA World]] hypothesis.

The new RNA ligase deoxyribozyme contained just twelve point mutations, two of which had no effect on activity, and had a [[Specificity constant|catalytic efficiency]] of approximately 1/10 of the original ribozyme, though the researches hypothesized that the activity could be further increased through further selection.<ref name=\"Ribozyme_to_Deoxyribozyme\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Paul N, Springsteen G, Joyce GF | title = Conversion of a ribozyme to a deoxyribozyme through in vitro evolution | journal = Chemistry & Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 329\u201338 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16638538 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.01.007 }}</ref>\nThis first evidence for transfer of function between different nucleic acids could provide support for various [[RNA world#Alternative hypotheses|pre-RNA World]] hypotheses.\n\n==\"True\" catalysis?==\nBecause most deoxyribozymes suffer from [[product inhibition]] and thus exhibit single-[[Turnover number|turnover]] behavior, it is sometimes argued that deoxyribozymes do not exhibit \"true\" catalytic behavior since they cannot undergo multiple-turnover catalysis like most biological [[enzyme]]s. However, the general definition of a [[Catalysis|catalyst]] requires only that the substance speeds up the [[Chemical kinetics|rate]] of a [[chemical reaction]] without being consumed by the reaction (i.e. it is not permanently chemically altered and can be recycled). Thus, by this definition, single-turnover deoxyribozymes are indeed catalysts.<ref name=\"Silverman_2004\" /> Furthermore, many [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] [[enzyme]]s (both [[protein]]s and [[ribozyme]]s) also exhibit single-turnover behavior,<ref name=\"Silverman_2004\" /> and so the exclusion of deoxyribozymes from the rank of \"catalyst\" simply because it does not feature multiple-turnover behavior seems unjustified.\n\n==Applications==\nAlthough RNA enzymes were discovered before DNA enzymes, the latter have some distinct advantages.

The pool is synthesized through [[Oligonucleotide synthesis#Synthesis by the phosphoramidite method|solid phase synthesis]] such that each strand has two constant regions ([[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] binding sites for PCR amplification) flanking a random region of a certain length, typically 25\u201350 bases long. Thus the total number of unique strands, called the sequence space, is 4<sup>N</sup> where ''N'' denotes the number of bases in the random region. Because 4<sup>25</sup> \u2248 10<sup>15</sup>, there is no practical reason to choose random regions of less than 25 bases in length, while going above this number of bases means that the total sequence space cannot be surveyed. However, since there are likely many potential candidates for a given catalytic reaction within the sequence space, random regions of 50 and even higher have successfully yielded catalytic deoxyribozymes.<ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" />\n\nThe pool is first subjected to a selection step, during which the catalytic strands are separated from the non-catalytic strands. The exact separation method will depend on the reaction being catalyzed. As an example, the separation step for ribonucleotide cleavage often utilizes [[affinity chromatography]], in which a [[Protein tag|biological tag]] attached to each DNA strand is removed from any catalytically active strands via cleavage of a ribonucleotide base. This allows the catalytic strands to be separated by a column that specifically binds the tag, since the non-active strands will remain bound to the column while the active strands (which no longer possess the tag) flow through. A common set-up for this is a [[biotin]] tag with a [[streptavidin]] affinity column.<ref name=\"Joyce_2004\" /><ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> [[Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids|Gel electrophoresis]] based separation can also be used in which the change in molecular weight of strands upon the cleavage reaction is enough to cause a shift in the location of the reactive strands on the gel.<ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> After the selection step, the reactive pool is amplified via [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) to regenerate and amplify the reactive strands, and the process is repeated until a pool of sufficient reactivity is obtained. Multiple rounds of selection are required because some non-catalytic strands will inevitably make it through any single selection step. Usually 4\u201310 rounds are required for unambiguous catalytic activity,<ref name=\"Silverman_2005\" /> though more rounds are often necessary for more stringent catalytic conditions. After a sufficient number of rounds, the final pool is sequenced and the individual strands are tested for their catalytic activity.<ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> The dynamics of the pool can be described through mathematical modeling\n<ref name=\"Spill_2016\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Spill F, Weinstein ZB, Irani Shemirani A, Ho N, Desai D, Zaman MH | title = Controlling uncertainty in aptamer selection | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 113 | issue = 43 | pages = 12076\u201312081 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27790993 | pmc = 5087011 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1605086113 }}\n</ref>\n, which shows how oligonucleotides undergo competitive binding with the targets and how the evolutionary outcome can be improved through fine tuning of parameters.\n\nDeoxyribozymes obtained through ''in vitro'' selection will be optimized for the conditions during the selection, such as [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] concentration, [[pH]], and the presence of [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]]. Because of this, catalytic activity only in the presence of specific cofactors or other conditions can be achieved using positive selection steps, as well as negative selection steps against other undesired conditions.\n\n===''in vitro'' evolution===\nA similar method of obtaining new deoxyribozymes is through ''in vitro'' evolution. Though this term is often used interchangeably with ''in vitro'' selection, ''in vitro'' evolution more appropriately refers to a slightly different procedure in which the initial oligonucleotide pool is genetically altered over subsequent rounds through [[genetic recombination]] or through [[point mutation]]s.<ref name=\"Joyce_2004\" /><ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> For point mutations, the pool can be amplified using [[error-prone PCR]] to produce many different strands of various random, single mutations. As with ''in vitro'' selection, the evolved strands with increased activity will tend to dominate the pool after multiple selection steps, and once a sufficient catalytic activity is reached, the pool can be sequenced to identify the most active strands.\n\nThe initial pool for ''in vitro'' evolution can be derived from a narrowed subset of sequence space, such as a certain round of an ''in vitro'' selection experiment, which is sometimes also called ''in vitro'' reselection.<ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> The initial pool can also be derived from amplification of a single oligonucleotide strand. As an example of the latter, a recent study showed that a functional deoxyribozyme can be selected through ''in vitro'' evolution of a non-catalytic oligonucleotide precursor strand. An arbitrarily chosen DNA fragment derived from the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA transcript]] of [[bovine serum albumin]] was evolved through random point mutations over 25 rounds of selection. Through [[deep sequencing]] analysis of various pool generations, the evolution of the most catalytic deoxyribozyme strand could be tracked through each subsequent single mutation.<ref name=\"Gysbers\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gysbers R, Tram K, Gu J, Li Y | title = Evolution of an Enzyme from a Noncatalytic Nucleic Acid Sequence | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | pages = 11405 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26091540 | pmc = 4473686 | doi = 10.1038/srep11405 }}</ref>\nThis first successful evolution of catalytic DNA from a non-catalytic precursor could provide support for the [[RNA World]] hypothesis.

The new RNA ligase deoxyribozyme contained just twelve point mutations, two of which had no effect on activity, and had a [[Specificity constant|catalytic efficiency]] of approximately 1/10 of the original ribozyme, though the researches hypothesized that the activity could be further increased through further selection.<ref name=\"Ribozyme_to_Deoxyribozyme\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Paul N, Springsteen G, Joyce GF | title = Conversion of a ribozyme to a deoxyribozyme through in vitro evolution | journal = Chemistry & Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 329\u201338 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16638538 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.01.007 }}</ref>\nThis first evidence for transfer of function between different nucleic acids could provide support for various [[RNA world#Alternative hypotheses|pre-RNA World]] hypotheses.\n\n==\"True\" catalysis?==\nBecause most deoxyribozymes suffer from [[product inhibition]] and thus exhibit single-[[Turnover number|turnover]] behavior, it is sometimes argued that deoxyribozymes do not exhibit \"true\" catalytic behavior since they cannot undergo multiple-turnover catalysis like most biological [[enzyme]]s. However, the general definition of a [[Catalysis|catalyst]] requires only that the substance speeds up the [[Chemical kinetics|rate]] of a [[chemical reaction]] without being consumed by the reaction (i.e. it is not permanently chemically altered and can be recycled). Thus, by this definition, single-turnover deoxyribozymes are indeed catalysts.<ref name=\"Silverman_2004\" /> Furthermore, many [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] [[enzyme]]s (both [[protein]]s and [[ribozyme]]s) also exhibit single-turnover behavior,<ref name=\"Silverman_2004\" /> and so the exclusion of deoxyribozymes from the rank of \"catalyst\" simply because it does not feature multiple-turnover behavior seems unjustified.\n\n==Applications==\nAlthough RNA enzymes were discovered before DNA enzymes, the latter have some distinct advantages.

Additionally, with this treatment it is expected that hepatic metastasis would also be inhibited, via the inhibition of IGF-I in the liver (the major source of serum IGF-I).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fokina AA, Meschaninova MI, Durfort T, Venyaminova AG, Fran\u00e7ois JC | title = Targeting insulin-like growth factor I with 10-23 DNAzymes: 2'-O-methyl modifications in the catalytic core enhance mRNA cleavage | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 51 | issue = 11 | pages = 2181\u201391 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22352843 | doi = 10.1021/bi201532q }}</ref>\n\n===Sensors===\nDNAzymes have found practical use in metal biosensors.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Chem.

series, specials (including [[List of original stand-up comedy specials distributed by Netflix|stand-up comedy specials]]), miniseries and [[List of original films distributed by Netflix|documentaries and films]]. Netflix's original productions also include continuations of canceled series from other networks, as well as licensing or co-producing content from international broadcasters for exclusive broadcast in other territories, which is also branded in those regions as Netflix original content. Netflix previously produced content through [[Red Envelope Entertainment]]. Netflix's first original content series was ''[[House of Cards (American TV series)|House of Cards]]'', released in 2013. The company has since increased its original content. All programming is in English unless stated otherwise, is organized by its primary genre or format and is sorted by premiere date.\n\n==Original programming==\nThese shows had their original production commissioned by Netflix, or had additional seasons commissioned by Netflix.\n\n===Drama===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\" id=\"dramashows\"\n|-\n!

Built with [[Brisbane tuff]] from the nearby [[Kangaroo Point Cliffs]] and sandstone from a quarry near today's Albion Park Racecourse, it is now the home of the Royal Historical Society of Brisbane. It contains a museum and can also be hired for small functions.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Origin of Australia's Capital Cities |last=Statham-Drew |first=Pamela|page=257 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-40832-5 |year=1990 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Australia |last=Pike |first=Jeffrey |publisher=Insight |isbn=978-981-234-799-2 |year=2002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenslandhistory.org.au/comm.html |title=The Commissariat Stores |accessdate=24 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523150756/http://www.queenslandhistory.org.au/comm.html |archivedate=23 May 2008 }}</ref> Greater Brisbane had a density of {{convert|148|PD/sqkm}} in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/communityprofile/3GBRI?opendocument|title=2016 Census Community Profile \u2013 Greater Brisbane (3GBRI \u2013 GCCSA)|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714080526/http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/communityprofile/3GBRI?opendocument|archivedate=14 July 2017}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/CensusOutput/copsub2016.NSF/All%20docs%20by%20catNo/2016~Community%20Profile~3GBRI/$File/GCP_3GBRI.zip?OpenElement |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714081035/http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/CensusOutput/copsub2016.NSF/All%20docs%20by%20catNo/2016~Community%20Profile~3GBRI/$File/GCP_3GBRI.zip?OpenElement |archivedate=14 July 2017}}, ZIPed Excel spreadsheet. Cover & G01a</ref> Like most Australian and North American cities, Brisbane has a sprawling metropolitan area which takes in excess of one hour to traverse either north to south or east to west by car without traffic.\n\nPre-1950 housing was often built in a distinctive architectural style known as a [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]], featuring timber construction with large [[verandah]]s and high ceilings. The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Many of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), that were originally timber, but are now frequently replaced by steel or concrete. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nFrom the 1970s onward, there has been a large increase in the construction of [[apartment]] developments, including [[low-rise building|mid-rise]] and [[high-rise building|high rise]] buildings, which has quickened in the 21st century. At the 2016 census, 76.4% of residents lived in [[Single-family detached home|separate houses]], 12.6% lived in [[apartment]]s, and 10% lived in [[townhouse]]s, [[terrace house]]s, or [[semidetached]] houses.<ref name=\"QS 3GBRI 2016\">{{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/3GBRI?opendocument |title=2016 Census QuickStats |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |access-date=4 August 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714081145/http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/3GBRI?opendocument |archivedate=14 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]].

The Old Windmill was originally used for the grinding of grain and a punishment for the convicts who manually operated the grinding mill. The Old Windmill tower's other significant claim to fame, largely ignored, is that the first television signals in the southern hemisphere were transmitted from it by experimenters in April 1934\u2014long before TV commenced in most places. These experimental TV broadcasts continued until World War II.<ref name=\"oldwindmill\"/> The Old Commissariat Store, on William Street, built by convict labour in 1828, was originally used partly as a grainhouse, has also been a hostel for immigrants and used for the storage of records. Built with [[Brisbane tuff]] from the nearby [[Kangaroo Point Cliffs]] and sandstone from a quarry near today's Albion Park Racecourse, it is now the home of the Royal Historical Society of Brisbane. It contains a museum and can also be hired for small functions.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Origin of Australia's Capital Cities |last=Statham-Drew |first=Pamela|page=257 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-40832-5 |year=1990 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Australia |last=Pike |first=Jeffrey |publisher=Insight |isbn=978-981-234-799-2 |year=2002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenslandhistory.org.au/comm.html |title=The Commissariat Stores |accessdate=24 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523150756/http://www.queenslandhistory.org.au/comm.html |archivedate=23 May 2008 }}</ref> Greater Brisbane had a density of {{convert|148|PD/sqkm}} in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/communityprofile/3GBRI?opendocument|title=2016 Census Community Profile \u2013 Greater Brisbane (3GBRI \u2013 GCCSA)|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714080526/http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/communityprofile/3GBRI?opendocument|archivedate=14 July 2017}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/CensusOutput/copsub2016.NSF/All%20docs%20by%20catNo/2016~Community%20Profile~3GBRI/$File/GCP_3GBRI.zip?OpenElement |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714081035/http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/CensusOutput/copsub2016.NSF/All%20docs%20by%20catNo/2016~Community%20Profile~3GBRI/$File/GCP_3GBRI.zip?OpenElement |archivedate=14 July 2017}}, ZIPed Excel spreadsheet. Cover & G01a</ref> Like most Australian and North American cities, Brisbane has a sprawling metropolitan area which takes in excess of one hour to traverse either north to south or east to west by car without traffic.\n\nPre-1950 housing was often built in a distinctive architectural style known as a [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]], featuring timber construction with large [[verandah]]s and high ceilings. The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Many of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), that were originally timber, but are now frequently replaced by steel or concrete. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nFrom the 1970s onward, there has been a large increase in the construction of [[apartment]] developments, including [[low-rise building|mid-rise]] and [[high-rise building|high rise]] buildings, which has quickened in the 21st century. At the 2016 census, 76.4% of residents lived in [[Single-family detached home|separate houses]], 12.6% lived in [[apartment]]s, and 10% lived in [[townhouse]]s, [[terrace house]]s, or [[semidetached]] houses.<ref name=\"QS 3GBRI 2016\">{{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/3GBRI?opendocument |title=2016 Census QuickStats |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |access-date=4 August 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714081145/http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/3GBRI?opendocument |archivedate=14 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]].

Torres Strait Creole is spoken by most Torres Strait Islanders and is a mixture of [[Standard Australian English]] and traditional languages. It is an English-based creole; however, each island has its own version of creole. Torres Strait Creole is also spoken on the [[Australian mainland]], including [[Northern Peninsula Area Region]] and coastal communities such as [[Cairns]], [[Townsville]], [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]], [[Rockhampton]] and Brisbane.<ref>{{Cite SLQ-CC-BY|url=https://maps.slq.qld.gov.au/iyil/view/173?embed=true|title=Yupanguthi|author=|date=|website=Queensland\u2019s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Languages map|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{main|List of people from Brisbane}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Culture of Brisbane]]\n* [[History of Brisbane]]\n* [[Geography of Brisbane]]\n* [[Climate of Brisbane]]\n* [[Demographics of Brisbane]]\n* [[Economy of Brisbane]]\n* [[Tourism in Brisbane]]\n* [[Transport in Brisbane]]\n* [[Sport in Brisbane]]\n* [[List of Brisbane suburbs]]\n* [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane]]\n* [[List of museums in Brisbane]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"N\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/ City of Brisbane]\n* [http://www.visitbrisbane.com.au/ Official tourism website of Brisbane]\n* [http://www.australia.com/en-us/places/brisbane.html Official Tourism Board Brisbane Page \u2013 Tourism Australia]\n* [http://www.nfsa.gov.au/blog/2013/05/02/southern-queensland-time-capsule/ Historical footage of Brisbane and Southern Queensland]\n\n{{Brisbane}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Articles relating to the City of Brisbane\n|list =\n{{South East Queensland}}\n{{Capital cities of Australia}}\n{{Queensland cities}}\n{{Cities of Australia}}\n}}\n{{Subject bar|portal1= Queensland |portal2= Australia|commons=yes|n=yes|n-search=Category:Brisbane|voy=yes|d=yes|d-search=Q34932}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1824 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Australian capital cities]]\n[[Category:Brisbane| ]]\n[[Category:Cities in Queensland]]\n[[Category:Coastal cities in Australia]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1824]]\n[[Category:Port cities in Queensland]]\n", "name_user": "Stirfries", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane"}

'''Corrientes Province''' ({{lang-es|Provincia de Corrientes}}; {{lang-gn|Taragui Tet\u00e3mini}}) is a [[Provinces of Argentina|province]] in northeast [[Argentina]], in the [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|Mesopotamia region]]. It is surrounded by (from the north, clockwise): [[Paraguay]], the province of [[Misiones Province|Misiones]], Brazil, [[Uruguay]], and the provinces of [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre Rios]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and [[Chaco Province|Chaco]].\n\n==History==\nBefore the arrival of the Spanish conquest, the [[Kaingang people|Kaingang]], [[Charrua]] and [[Guarani people|Guaran\u00ed]] lived in a big area that also covered most of the current province of Corrientes. The city of Corrientes was founded on April 3, 1588 by [[Juan Torres de Vera y Arag\u00f3n]] as a mid-stop between [[Asunci\u00f3n]] and [[Buenos Aires]]; the city flourished thanks to the traffic from the route. [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] erected [[Missionary|missions]] in the north of the province, where they dedicated themselves to the expansion of the faith.\nIn the wars of independence from Spain, Corrientes joined [[Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas|Artigas]]' ''Liga de los Pueblos Libres'' (1814\u20131820). The attack of Paraguayan forces on the province in 1865 marked the start of the [[Paraguayan War|War of the Triple Alliance]].\n\nIn 1919 the [[National University of the Littoral]] was founded, which in 1956 became the [[National University of the Northeast]].\n\n[[File:Corrientes 1856.jpg|thumb|left|140px |Corrientes 1 real stamp (1856)]]\nCorrientes is legendary in the world of [[philately]] for the postage stamps it issued from 1856 to 1880.  These are among the very early or \"classic\" postage stamps of the world (the [[Penny Black|first, from Great Britain]], were issued in 1840; [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States#First stamps|those by the United States in 1847]]).  The Corrientes stamps were close copies of the [[Ceres series (France)#Stamps of France|first issue of stamps from France]], which depicted the profile head of [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], the Roman goddess of agriculture, and were individually crudely engraved by hand, so that each [[Die proof (philately)|die]] is noticeably different, and were printed in small sheets. The first issues, from 1856 to 1860, bore the denomination in the lower panel; in 1860, the value panel was erased; the different denominations thereafter being indicated by the color of the paper used. As locally produced \"[[primitive (philately)|primitive]]s\", the early Corrientes stamps have long been prized by collectors.  After 1880, [[Postage stamps and postal history of Argentina|stamps of Argentina]] were used.<ref>Louis Stich, ''Corrientes: the Issues from 1856\u201380'', The Collectors Club, New York, 1957.</ref>\n\nFor much of the 19th and 20th centuries, politics in Corrientes were dominated by the Romero Feris family, prominent local landowners who still control most of the province's [[tobacco]] output. During most of this time, the Romero Ferises created one of Argentina's most bloated government payrolls (over 10% of total employment) and suppressed dissent and efforts at even modest land reform. Following contentious election results in 1991, however, public protest forced President [[Carlos Menem]] to remove Governor Ra\u00fal \"Tato\" Romero Feris from office and, though he was elected mayor of the province's capital in 1997, Romero Feris was ultimately indicted for embezzlement of public funds in 1999. He was sentenced to seven years in prison in May, 2002.<ref>[http://www.voxpopuli.com.ar/archivo/2004/abril/misiones2004040907.shtml ''El Diario Digital'' {{in lang|es}}]</ref> \n[[File:Central vista externa en gris.jpg|thumb|The [[Yacyret\u00e1 Dam]]]]\n\nCorrientes had a significant impact in national politics in subsequent years. A [[Uni\u00f3n C\u00edvica Radical|UCR]]-led alliance defeated the Romero Feris machine in the 2001 governor's race, but the Corrientes UCR's continued support for President [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] led to a rebuke from the national committee of the UCR itself, and this triggered a revolt from the Corrientes chapter of the party, as well as a number of others' (notably in [[Mendoza Province]]). These differences led to the appearance that year of [[w:es:Radicales K|\"K\" Radicals]]{{spaced ndash}}UCR governors and other lawmakers allied to President Kirchner.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061020030830/http://www.4semanas.com.ar/21082006/radicales.htm ''4 Semanas'' {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n\nThe northeastern tip of Corrientes Province was chosen as the site for [[Yacyret\u00e1 Dam]] following an agreement between President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] and Paraguayan President [[Alfredo Stroessner]] in 1974. Yacyret\u00e1, whose 20-year-long construction and US$11&nbsp;billion cost far exceeded initial estimates, is one of the largest [[hydroelectric dam]]s in the world. Currently, an agreement is being pursued with [[Paraguay]] which would allow reservoir expansion works that could double the facility's current installed electric capacity of 4,050 MW.<ref>[http://www.rivernet.org/southamerica/parana_basin/yacyreta.htm RiverNet: the Yacyret\u00e1 Dam]</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[Image:Museo hist\u00f3rico provincial Corrientes.jpeg|thumb|left|Corrientes Historical Museum]]\nCulture in Corrientes has been primarily informed and influenced by its European and Guarani roots; an example of this is the [[chamam\u00e9]] genre of music.\n\nFamous ''correntinos'' were independence hero General Don [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] (born in 1778 in [[Yapey\u00fa, Corrientes|Yapey\u00fa]]) and [[Juan Bautista Cabral]] (born in [[Saladas, Corrientes|Saladas]]), who (according to popular legend) died for the general in the [[Battle of San Lorenzo]].\n\nTourist destinations in the Corrientes Province include the [[Iber\u00e1 Wetlands]] and the [[Mburucuy\u00e1 National Park]].\n\n===Official languages===\nOn 22 October 2004, Provincial Law No. 5598 (Decree 2326/2004) declared [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] to be an [[official language]] of Corrientes, alongside Spanish.<ref name=\"Corrientes-5598\">{{Cite Argentine law|jur=CN|l=5598|dl=2326/2004|date=22 October 2004 |url=http://www.senadoctes.gov.ar/leyes-texto/Ley5598.doc }}</ref> It was the first Argentine province to officialize a language other than Spanish, followed in 2010 by [[Chaco Province#Official languages|Chaco]].<ref>{{cite Argentine law|jur=CC|l=6604|bo=9092|date=28 de julio de 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{see also|Climate of Argentina|Climatic regions of Argentina}}\n\nCorrientes is surrounded by two rivers \u2013 the [[Uruguay River]] to the east, and the [[Paran\u00e1 River]] to the northwest \u2013 that contour the shape of the province. The low shore of the Paran\u00e1 produces frequent floodings. After a specially destructive one in 1982, a protective system has been started with the construction of barriers.\n\nThe province is for the most part a [[plain]], with the highest points in the east. To the west, a series of descending platforms go down to the Paran\u00e1 River. The [[Iber\u00e1 Wetlands]], an area of [[lagoons]] and [[swamps]], is a vast [[Depression (geology)|depression]] from [[Volcano|volcanic]] flow, covered later with [[fluvial]] and [[Wind energy|eolic]] sediments.\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate is predominantly [[subtropical]] with no dry season.<ref name=deycclima>{{cite web|url=http://www.deyc-corrientes.gov.ar/geografia.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526165954/http://www.deyc-corrientes.gov.ar/geografia.html |archivedate=26 May 2016 |title=Clima |publisher=Direcci\u00f3n de Estad\u00edstica y Censos de la Provincia de Corrientes |language=Spanish |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> The mean annual temperature is {{convert|20|C|F|0}} with monthly mean temperatures ranging from {{convert|14|C|F|0}} in July to {{convert|26|F|0}} in January.{{sfn|Rubio|2018|p=175}} Temperatures are hot for most of the year while precipitation is abundant and evenly distributed throughout the year.<ref name=deycclima/> There are four seasons: winter, spring, summer, and autumn.<ref name=deycclima/> Winters are short although occasional incursions of cold, polar air from the south can produce frosts.<ref name = deycclima/> In contrast, temperatures during summer can reach to {{convert|35|to|40|C|F|0}}.<ref name=deycclima/> Mean annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|1100|to|1900|mm|in|0}} which decreases from northeast to southwest.<ref name=deycclima/> Autumn is the rainiest season while winter is the driest.{{sfn|Rubio|2018|p=175}}\n\n== Economy ==\nCorrientes, like much of the Argentine north, has long had a relatively underdeveloped economy. Its 2006 output was estimated at US$4.2&nbsp;billion (which shall be around US$6.7&nbsp;billion in 2011, according to Argentina's economic growth), or, US$4,540 per capita (around US$6,600 in 2011), nearly 40% below the national average.<ref>[http://www.iader.org.ar I.A.D.E.R<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n[[Agriculture]] is still one of the main activities in the province, adding 15% to its output.  It is centred in [[citrus]], [[tobacco]], [[rice]], [[tea]], [[cotton]] and [[yerba mate]], exported internationally. The [[timber]] industry uses 1,400&nbsp;km\u00b2 of [[pine]] and [[eucalyptus]] forests.\n[[Image:PortCorrientes.JPG|thumb|240px|Port of Corrientes, on the [[Paran\u00e1 River]]]]\n[[Bovine]] cattle has problems standing the heat and the low quality of the grass specially in the north of the province. For that reason, the [[Brangus]] breed is the most common in the area. In the south, different breeds can be found. 70,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of the province's land are used for more than 4 million heads of cattle.\n\nAmong Corrientes' productive (non-services) activities, [[tobacco]] and its processing earns 45% of the province's gross income, food and derivates, 30%, and [[textile]]s, 16%.\n\nOn the Paran\u00e1 River, near the city of [[Ituzaing\u00f3, Corrientes|Ituzaing\u00f3]], the [[Yaciret\u00e1 dam]] provides energy not only to the province, but to both Argentina and [[Paraguay]].\n\nTourism has been growing in Corrientes Province due to the relevance that [[Esteros del Ibera]] has for [[ecotourism]] and birdwatching travelers.  [[Golden dorado]] fishing has long attracted both local and outside tourism to Corrientes.\n\n==Political division==\nThe provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court. The legislative branch is a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] body composed of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The Legislature is charged with introducing and passing local laws. \n{{main|Legislature of Corrientes |Governor of Corrientes Province }}\nThe Constitution of Corrientes Province forms the formal law of the province.\n\nIn Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the [[Argentine Federal Police]] but the additional work is carried out by the [[Corrientes Provincial

'''Corrientes Province''' ({{lang-es|Provincia de Corrientes}}; {{lang-gn|Taragui Tet\u00e3mini}}) is a [[Provinces of Argentina|province]] in northeast [[Argentina]], in the [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|Mesopotamia region]]. It is surrounded by (from the north, clockwise): [[Paraguay]], the province of [[Misiones Province|Misiones]], Brazil, [[Uruguay]], and the provinces of [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre Rios]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and [[Chaco Province|Chaco]].\n\n==History==\nBefore the arrival of the Spanish conquest, the [[Kaingang people|Kaingang]], [[Charrua]] and [[Guarani people|Guaran\u00ed]] lived in a big area that also covered most of the current province of Corrientes. The city of Corrientes was founded on April 3, 1588 by [[Juan Torres de Vera y Arag\u00f3n]] as a mid-stop between [[Asunci\u00f3n]] and [[Buenos Aires]]; the city flourished thanks to the traffic from the route. [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] erected [[Missionary|missions]] in the north of the province, where they dedicated themselves to the expansion of the faith.\nIn the wars of independence from Spain, Corrientes joined [[Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas|Artigas]]' ''Liga de los Pueblos Libres'' (1814\u20131820). The attack of Paraguayan forces on the province in 1865 marked the start of the [[Paraguayan War|War of the Triple Alliance]].\n\nIn 1919 the [[National University of the Littoral]] was founded, which in 1956 became the [[National University of the Northeast]].\n\n[[File:Corrientes 1856.jpg|thumb|left|140px |Corrientes 1 real stamp (1856)]]\nCorrientes is legendary in the world of [[philately]] for the postage stamps it issued from 1856 to 1880.  These are among the very early or \"classic\" postage stamps of the world (the [[Penny Black|first, from Great Britain]], were issued in 1840; [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States#First stamps|those by the United States in 1847]]).  The Corrientes stamps were close copies of the [[Ceres series (France)#Stamps of France|first issue of stamps from France]], which depicted the profile head of [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], the Roman goddess of agriculture, and were individually crudely engraved by hand, so that each [[Die proof (philately)|die]] is noticeably different, and were printed in small sheets. The first issues, from 1856 to 1860, bore the denomination in the lower panel; in 1860, the value panel was erased; the different denominations thereafter being indicated by the color of the paper used. As locally produced \"[[primitive (philately)|primitive]]s\", the early Corrientes stamps have long been prized by collectors.  After 1880, [[Postage stamps and postal history of Argentina|stamps of Argentina]] were used.<ref>Louis Stich, ''Corrientes: the Issues from 1856\u201380'', The Collectors Club, New York, 1957.</ref>\n\nFor much of the 19th and 20th centuries, politics in Corrientes were dominated by the Romero Feris family, prominent local landowners who still control most of the province's [[tobacco]] output. During most of this time, the Romero Ferises created one of Argentina's most bloated government payrolls (over 10% of total employment) and suppressed dissent and efforts at even modest land reform. Following contentious election results in 1991, however, public protest forced President [[Carlos Menem]] to remove Governor Ra\u00fal \"Tato\" Romero Feris from office and, though he was elected mayor of the province's capital in 1997, Romero Feris was ultimately indicted for embezzlement of public funds in 1999. He was sentenced to seven years in prison in May, 2002.<ref>[http://www.voxpopuli.com.ar/archivo/2004/abril/misiones2004040907.shtml ''El Diario Digital'' {{in lang|es}}]</ref> \n[[File:Central vista externa en gris.jpg|thumb|The [[Yacyret\u00e1 Dam]]]]\n\nCorrientes had a significant impact in national politics in subsequent years. A [[Uni\u00f3n C\u00edvica Radical|UCR]]-led alliance defeated the Romero Feris machine in the 2001 governor's race, but the Corrientes UCR's continued support for President [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] led to a rebuke from the national committee of the UCR itself, and this triggered a revolt from the Corrientes chapter of the party, as well as a number of others' (notably in [[Mendoza Province]]). These differences led to the appearance that year of [[w:es:Radicales K|\"K\" Radicals]]{{spaced ndash}}UCR governors and other lawmakers allied to President Kirchner.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061020030830/http://www.4semanas.com.ar/21082006/radicales.htm ''4 Semanas'' {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n\nThe northeastern tip of Corrientes Province was chosen as the site for [[Yacyret\u00e1 Dam]] following an agreement between President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] and Paraguayan President [[Alfredo Stroessner]] in 1974. Yacyret\u00e1, whose 20-year-long construction and US$11&nbsp;billion cost far exceeded initial estimates, is one of the largest [[hydroelectric dam]]s in the world. Currently, an agreement is being pursued with [[Paraguay]] which would allow reservoir expansion works that could double the facility's current installed electric capacity of 4,050 MW.<ref>[http://www.rivernet.org/southamerica/parana_basin/yacyreta.htm RiverNet: the Yacyret\u00e1 Dam]</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[Image:Museo hist\u00f3rico provincial Corrientes.jpeg|thumb|left|Corrientes Historical Museum]]\nCulture in Corrientes has been primarily informed and influenced by its European and Guarani roots; an example of this is the [[chamam\u00e9]] genre of music.\n\nFamous ''correntinos'' were independence hero General Don [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] (born in 1778 in [[Yapey\u00fa, Corrientes|Yapey\u00fa]]) and [[Juan Bautista Cabral]] (born in [[Saladas, Corrientes|Saladas]]), who (according to popular legend) died for the general in the [[Battle of San Lorenzo]].\n\nTourist destinations in the Corrientes Province include the [[Iber\u00e1 Wetlands]] and the [[Mburucuy\u00e1 National Park]].\n\n===Official languages===\nOn 22 October 2004, Provincial Law No. 5598 (Decree 2326/2004) declared [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] to be an [[official language]] of Corrientes, alongside Spanish.<ref name=\"Corrientes-5598\">{{Cite Argentine law|jur=CN|l=5598|dl=2326/2004|date=22 October 2004 |url=http://www.senadoctes.gov.ar/leyes-texto/Ley5598.doc }}</ref> It was the first Argentine province to officialize a language other than Spanish, followed in 2010 by [[Chaco Province#Official languages|Chaco]].<ref>{{cite Argentine law|jur=CC|l=6604|bo=9092|date=28 de julio de 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{see also|Climate of Argentina|Climatic regions of Argentina}}\n\nCorrientes is surrounded by two rivers \u2013 the [[Uruguay River]] to the east, and the [[Paran\u00e1 River]] to the northwest \u2013 that contour the shape of the province.

The [[timber]] industry uses 1,400&nbsp;km\u00b2 of [[pine]] and [[eucalyptus]] forests.\n[[Image:PortCorrientes.JPG|thumb|240px|Port of Corrientes, on the [[Paran\u00e1 River]]]]\n[[Bovine]] cattle has problems standing the heat and the low quality of the grass specially in the north of the province. For that reason, the [[Brangus]] breed is the most common in the area. In the south, different breeds can be found. 70,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of the province's land are used for more than 4 million heads of cattle.\n\nAmong Corrientes' productive (non-services) activities, [[tobacco]] and its processing earns 45% of the province's gross income, food and derivates, 30%, and [[textile]]s, 16%.\n\nOn the Paran\u00e1 River, near the city of [[Ituzaing\u00f3, Corrientes|Ituzaing\u00f3]], the [[Yaciret\u00e1 dam]] provides energy not only to the province, but to both Argentina and [[Paraguay]].\n\nTourism has been growing in Corrientes Province due to the relevance that [[Esteros del Ibera]] has for [[ecotourism]] and birdwatching travelers.  [[Golden dorado]] fishing has long attracted both local and outside tourism to Corrientes.\n\n==Political division==\nThe provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court. The legislative branch is a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] body composed of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The Legislature is charged with introducing and passing local laws. \n{{main|Legislature of Corrientes |Governor of Corrientes Province }}\nThe Constitution of Corrientes Province forms the formal law of the province.\n\nIn Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the [[Argentine Federal Police]] but the additional work is carried out by the [[Corrientes Provincial Police]].\n\n[[Image:Casadegobiernocorrientes.jpg|thumb|240px|Governor's offices]]\nThe province is divided into 25 [[Departments of Argentina|departments]] (''departamentos''):\n\nDepartment (Capital)\n\n# [[Bella Vista Department]] ([[Bella Vista, Corrientes|Bella Vista]])\n# [[Ber\u00f3n de Astrada Department]] ([[Ber\u00f3n de Astrada]])\n# [[Capital Department, Corrientes|Capital Department]] ([[Corrientes]])\n# [[Concepci\u00f3n Department, Corrientes|Concepci\u00f3n Department]] ([[Concepci\u00f3n, Corrientes|Concepci\u00f3n]])\n# [[Curuz\u00fa Cuat\u00eda Department]] ([[Curuz\u00fa Cuati\u00e1]])\n# [[Empedrado Department]] ([[Empedrado, Corrientes|Empedrado]])\n# [[Esquina Department]] ([[Esquina, Corrientes|Esquina]])\n# [[General Alvear Department, Corrientes|General Alvear Department]] ([[Alvear, Corrientes|Alvear]])\n# [[General Paz Department]] ([[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario de Ca\u00e1 Cat\u00ed]])\n# [[Goya Department]] ([[Goya, Corrientes|Goya]])\n# [[Itat\u00ed Department]] ([[Itat\u00ed, Corrientes|Itat\u00ed]])\n# [[Ituzaing\u00f3 Department]] ([[Ituzaing\u00f3, Corrientes|Ituzaing\u00f3]])\n# [[Lavalle Department, Corrientes|Lavalle Department]] ([[Lavalle, Corrientes|Lavalle]])\n# [[Mburucuy\u00e1 Department]] ([[Mburucuy\u00e1, Corrientes|Mburucuy\u00e1]])\n# [[Mercedes Department]] ([[Mercedes, Corrientes|Mercedes]])\n# [[Monte Caseros Department]] ([[Monte Caseros, Corrientes|Monte Caseros]])\n# [[Paso de los Libres Department]] ([[Paso de los Libres, Corrientes|Paso de los Libres]])\n# [[Saladas Department]] ([[Saladas, Corrientes|Saladas]])\n# [[San Cosme Department]] ([[San Cosme, Corrientes|San Cosme]])\n# [[San Luis del Palmar Department]] ([[San Luis del Palmar]])\n# [[San Mart\u00edn Department, Corrientes|San Mart\u00edn Department]] ([[La Cruz, Corrientes|La Cruz]])\n# [[San Miguel Department, Corrientes|San Miguel Department]] ([[San Miguel, Corrientes|San Miguel]])\n# [[San Roque Department]] ([[San Roque, Corrientes|San Roque]])\n# [[Santo Tom\u00e9 Department]] ([[Santo Tom\u00e9, Corrientes|Santo Tom\u00e9]])\n# [[Sauce Department]] ([[Sauce, Corrientes|Sauce]])\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Books===\n* {{cite book |last1=Rubio |first1=Gerardo |last2=Lavado |first2=Raul |last3=Pereyra |first3=Fernando |title=The Soils of Argentina |publisher=Springer |year=2018 |isbn=978-3-319-76853-3 |ref={{sfnRef|Rubio|2018}}|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-76853-3 }}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Corrientes Province}}\n* {{in lang|es}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20060714155149/http://www.corrientes.gov.ar/ Official site]\n* {{in lang|es}} [http://www.todo-argentina.net/Geografia/provincias/Corrientes/historia.htm History]\n* [http://www.esterosdelibera.com Esteros del Iber\u00e1] (in English and Spanish)\n* {{in lang|es}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20030508114733/http://www.argentinaworld.com.ar/Provincia/Corrientes/index-xdata.php?grup=4&xdata=1 Corrientes Info]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100809092330/http://www.guiafe.com.ar/fotos-argentina/categories.php?cat_id=37 Pictures of Corrientes]\n\n{{Departments Corrientes}}\n{{Provinces of Argentina}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Provinces of Argentina]]\n[[Category:Corrientes Province| ]]\n", "name_user": "JoakoCABJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrientes_Province"}
