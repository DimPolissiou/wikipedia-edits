The [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) committed almost all their remaining mobile forces, especially the [[18th Division (South Vietnam)|18th Division]], under [[Brigadier general]] [[L\u00ea Minh \u0110\u1ea3o]], to the defence of the strategic crossroads town of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, hoping to stall the advance of the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN). The battle was fought between 9 and 21 April 1975, and ended when the town of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c was captured by the PAVN 4th Army Corps. This was the ARVN [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps]]' last defensive line of South Vietnam's capital, [[Saigon]]. The line connected the city of [[B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province|B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng]], [[Bien Hoa Air Base]], [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]], Long An and the lynchpin centered on the strategic town of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, where the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff committed the nation's final reserve forces in Saigon's defense. Once Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c fell on 21 April 1975, the PAVN battled with the last remaining elements of III Corps Armored Task Force, remnants of the 18th Infantry Division and depleted [[Republic of Vietnam Marine Division|Marine]], [[Republic of Vietnam Airborne Division|Airborne]] and [[Vietnamese Rangers|Ranger]] Battalions in a fighting retreat that lasted nine days, until they reached Saigon and PAVN armored columns crashed throughout the gates of South Vietnam's [[Independence Palace|Presidential Palace]] on 30 April 1975, effectively [[Fall of Saigon|ending the war]].\n\nFrom the beginning of 1975, PAVN forces swept through the northern provinces of South Vietnam virtually unopposed. In the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]], South Vietnam's [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II Corps]] was completely destroyed, whilst attempting to evacuate to the [[Mekong Delta]] region. In the cities of [[Hu\u1ebf]] and [[Da Nang]], ARVN units simply dissolved without putting up resistance. The devastating defeats suffered by the ARVN prompted South Vietnam's National Assembly to question President [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]]'s handling of the war, thereby placing him under tremendous pressure to resign.\n\nIn the last-ditch effort to save South Vietnam, Thi\u1ec7u ordered the 18th Infantry Division to hold Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c at all costs. The PAVN 4th Army Corps, on the other hand, was ordered to capture Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c in order to open the gateway to Saigon. During the initial stages of the battle, the 18th Division managed to beat off early attempts by the PAVN to capture the town, forcing PAVN commanders to change their battle plan. However, on 19 April 1975, Dao's forces were ordered to withdraw after Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c was almost completely isolated, with all remaining units badly mauled. This defeat also marked the end of Thi\u1ec7u's political career, as he resigned on 21 April 1975.\n\n==Background==\nIn the first half of 1975, the government of the Republic of Vietnam was in deep political turmoil, which reflected the military situation on the battlefield. At least two assassination attempts specifically targeting President Thi\u1ec7u were foiled. On 23 January an ARVN officer tried to shoot Thi\u1ec7u with his pistol but failed. The officer was subsequently tried by a military court.<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|208}} On 4 April a [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] (RVNAF) pilot Nguyen Thanh Trung bombed the [[Independence Palace]] with his [[F-5 Tiger]]. It later turned out that the pilot had been an undercover member of the [[Viet Cong]] since 1969.<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|208}} Following those failed assassination attempts, Thi\u1ec7u grew suspicious of his own military commanders.<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|208}}\n\nOn 2 April the [[South Vietnamese Senate]] recommended the formation of a new government with [[Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00e1 C\u1ea9n]] as the new leader. As a result, Prime Minister [[Tr\u1ea7n Thi\u1ec7n Khi\u00eam]] resigned from his position. Thi\u1ec7u, in response to the Senate's recommendations, immediately approved Tran Thien Kiem's resignation and swore in Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00e1 C\u1ea9n as the new Prime Minister.<ref name=Snepp>{{cite book|last=Snepp|first=Frank|title=A Disastrous Retreat|publisher=Ho Chi Minh City Publishing|year=2001|isbn=}}</ref>{{rp|75}} On 4 April while announcing the changes of government on Saigon television, Thi\u1ec7u also ordered the arrest of three army commanders: [[Major general]] [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n Ph\u00fa]] for the [[Battle of Ban Me Thuot|loss of Ban Me Thuot]], General [[Ph\u1ea1m Qu\u1ed1c Thu\u1ea7n]] for his failure to hold [[Nha Trang]] and [[Lieutenant general]] [[D\u01b0 Qu\u1ed1c \u0110\u1ed1ng]] for the [[Battle of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long|loss of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long]].

Weyand]] on 3 April, Thi\u1ec7u outlined his final strategy to defend South Vietnam, vowing to hold what was left of his country. In his strategy, Thi\u1ec7u decided that Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c would be the center of his country's resistance, with [[T\u00e2y Ninh]] and [[Phan Rang\u2013Th\u00e1p Ch\u00e0m|Phan Rang]] on either side.<ref name=Dawson/>{{rp|59}} Eventually, the meeting became more intense when Thi\u1ec7u produced a letter written by former U.S. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], which promised military retaliation against North Vietnam if they violated the terms of the [[Paris Peace Accords]]. The meeting then concluded with Thi\u1ec7u accusing the United States Government of selling out his country the moment they signed the Paris Peace Accords.<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|208}}\n\nIn contrast to the situation faced by their opponents in Saigon, the North Vietnamese government were buoyed by the victories achieved by their armies since December 1974. By 8 April 1975, the PAVN had captured all the provinces in South Vietnam's I and II Corps, as well as [[Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long Province]]. While the South Vietnamese forces were disintegrating all over the battlefield, North Vietnam had two army corps moving towards the last South Vietnamese stronghold at Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c.<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|372}} The PAVN [[4th Corps (Vietnam People's Army)|4th Army Corps]], which overran Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long several months earlier, approached Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c from the north-east after they conquered T\u00e2y Ninh, [[B\u00ecnh Long]] and [[Long Kh\u00e1nh]]. The [[3rd Corps (Vietnam People's Army)|3rd Army Corps]], on the other hand, moved towards Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c from the north-west after they defeated the ARVN in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]].<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|372}} Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c was at the crossroads of Highway 1 (which ran the length of South Vietnam) and Highway 20 (which ran from the Central Highlands through [[Da Lat]]) and it controlled the eastern approach to the huge military bases at [[Bien Hoa Air Base|Bien Hoa]]/[[Long Binh Post|Long Binh]] and then Saigon.<ref name=Veith>{{cite book|last=Veith|first=George|title=Black April The Fall of South Vietnam 1973\u201375|publisher=Encounter Books|year=2012|isbn=9781594035722}}</ref>{{rp|436}}\n\n==Order of battle==\n===South Vietnam===\n[[File:Xuanloc 18th.jpg|thumb|General [[L\u00ea Minh \u0110\u1ea3o|Le Minh Dao]], ARVN commander at Xuan Loc]]\nOn 8 April 1975, the ARVN 18th Division was the main unit defending Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, composed of three infantry regiments: the 43rd, 48th and 52nd. There were also five armored [[brigade]]s, four regional force [[battalion]]s (340th, 342nd, 343rd and 367th Battalions), two artillery units (181st and 182nd Artillery Battalions) equipped with forty-two artillery guns, and two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of the [[People's Self-Defense Force]].<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|229\u201330}} On 12 April Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c was reinforced with the 1st Airborne Brigade, three armoured brigades (315th, 318th and 322nd Armored Brigades), the 8th Task Force from the [[5th Division (South Vietnam)|5th Division]] and the 33rd Ranger Battalion. Air support came in the form of two RVNAF divisions; the 5th Air Force Division based at Bien Hoa Air Base, and the 3rd Air Force Division at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]].

The 4th Army Corps fielded three divisions (6th, [[7th Infantry Division (Vietnam)|7th]] and [[341st Division (Vietnam)|341st]] Infantry Divisions). Those divisions had support from the 71st Anti-Aircraft Regiment, two [[combat engineer]]ing regiments (24th and 25th Engineering Regiments), the 26th Communications Regiment, two armored battalions, two artillery battalions, and two Long Kh\u00e1nh provincial infantry battalions.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|112}} On 3 April 1975, the 4th Army Corps Command came up with two options for attack; the first option would involve capturing all ARVN outposts in the surrounding areas and isolating the town center in the process. If the opportunity arose, the 4th Army Corps would launch a full frontal assault on the town center to capture all of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c. In the second option, if ARVN forces in Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c did not have the strength to resist, the 4th Army Corps would strike directly at the town center using infantry units, with armored and artillery units in support.<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|381}}\n\n==Prelude==\nIn March 1975 as the PAVN 3rd Army Corps attacked [[Ban Me Thuot]] in the Central Highlands, the PAVN 4th Army Corps also initiated their own operations against South Vietnamese forces in T\u00e2y Ninh and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng, in the southwestern regions of South Vietnam. Unlike the previous three years, South Vietnamese defences around T\u00e2y Ninh and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng were significantly weakened due to the lack of manpower and resources. Even though T\u00e2y Ninh and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng did not play a significant role in the defensive posture of South Vietnam, large ARVN units made their way into those areas as a result of the early defeats in 1975. T\u00e2y Ninh became a refuge for elements of the ARVN [[25th Division (South Vietnam)|25th Division]], four armored brigades and two Ranger battalions. B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng, on the other hand, hosted the ARVN 5th Division, one Ranger battalion and one armored brigade. To stop ARVN units from gathering in T\u00e2y Ninh and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng, and thereby regrouping for further resistance, the North Vietnamese decided to capture those regions.<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|219}}\n\nThe PAVN 4th Army Corps Command selected D\u1ea7u Ti\u1ebfng\u2013Chon Thanh as the first target for their operation, as it was the weakest point in the South Vietnamese defensive line in the north-west area. South Vietnam maintained four [[South Vietnamese Regional Force|Regional Force]] (RF) battalions (35th, 304th, 312th and 352nd Battalions) which totalled 2,600 soldiers in the area, along with one armored brigade and ten 105&nbsp;mm artillery guns.

The task of capturing D\u1ea7u Ti\u1ebfng\u2013Chon Thanh was entrusted to the PAVN [[9th Division (Vietnam)|9th Infantry Division]], whose strength were bolstered by the 16th Infantry Regiment, the 22nd Armored Battalion, one artillery battalion and one air-defence battalion. At 05:00 on 11 March the 9th Infantry Division commenced their attack on D\u1ea7u Ti\u1ebfng. ARVN artillery positions in Rung Nan, Bau Don and Cha La were the primary targets of the 9th Infantry Division on the first day of the attack.<ref name=Dinh>{{cite book|last=Dinh|first=Van Thien|title=Battles on the Doorstep of Saigon|publisher=People's Army Publishing House|year=2005|isbn=}}</ref>{{rp|3}}\n\nOn the afternoon of 11 March ARVN General [[L\u00ea Nguy\u00ean Khang]] ordered the 345th Armored Squadron to move out from Bau Don to relieve the military zone of D\u1ea7u Ti\u1ebfng, but they were defeated by the PAVN 16th Infantry Regiment at Suoi Ong Hung, and were forced to retreat to their base. At the same time, ARVN artillery units at Bau Don and Rung Nan were subdued by elements of the 9th Infantry Division, so they were unable to return fire.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|102}} By 13 March the PAVN was in complete control of the D\u1ea7u Ti\u1ebfng military zone. After three hours of fighting, the PAVN 9th Infantry Division also captured ARVN positions at Vuon Chuoi, Nga ba Sac, Cau Tau and Ben Cui. The ARVN 3rd Brigade had planned to retake D\u1ea7u Ti\u1ebfng using elements of the 5th Division, but Thi\u1ec7u ordered them to pull back and defend Truong Mit, Bau Don and T\u00e2y Ninh instead.<ref name=Dinh/>{{rp|3\u20135}}\n\nOn 24 March two regiments from the PAVN 9th Infantry Division, in coordination with two provincial infantry battalions from B\u00ecnh Ph\u01b0\u1edbc, attacked Ch\u01a1n Th\u00e0nh with full force but were repeatedly driven back from ARVN defensive lines. On 31 March the PAVN 4th Army Corps sent the 273rd Regiment and one artillery battalion equipped with 15 artillery guns to bolster the 9th Infantry Division. Following the arrival of these reinforcements, the PAVN continued their assault on the military zone of Ch\u01a1n Th\u00e0nh. South Vietnam responded by deploying the 3rd Armored Brigade to relieve Ch\u01a1n Th\u00e0nh, but they were stopped by elements of the 9th Infantry Division along Route 13.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|104\u20135}} To avoid destruction, all surviving members from the ARVN 31st Ranger Battalion retreated to Bau Don in the east. On 2 April the PAVN captured Ch\u01a1n Th\u00e0nh; they claimed to have killed 2,134 ARVN soldiers, as well as capturing 472 and shot down 16 aircraft.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|104\u20135}} In addition, North Vietnam captured 30 military vehicles (including eight tanks) and about 1,000 guns (including five artillery pieces) of various kinds. With the province of Binh Long firmly in their hands, the PAVN then set their sights on Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|104\u20135}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:HCMC5.jpg|thumb|Movement of North and South Vietnamese forces]]\nThe PAVN began their Long Kh\u00e1nh-B\u00ecnh Tuy campaign with strong attacks against ARVN positions on the two principal lines of communication in the region, Highways [[National Route 1A (Vietnam)|1]] and 20 striking outposts, towns, bridges and culverts north and east of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c. On 17 March, the PAVN 209th Infantry Regiment and the 210th Artillery Regiment, 7th Division, opened what was to become the Battle of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c. The 209th struck first at \u0110\u1ecbnh Qu\u00e1n, north of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, and at the La Nga bridge, west of \u0110\u1ecbnh Qu\u00e1n. Eight tanks supported the initial assault on \u0110\u1ecbnh Qu\u00e1n and PAVN artillery fire destroyed four [[M114 155 mm howitzer|155&nbsp;mm howitzers]] supporting the RF. Anticipating the attack, \u0110\u1ea3o had reinforced the La Nga bridge the day before, but the intense fire forced a withdrawal from the bridge. After repeated assaults, the 209th Infantry penetrated \u0110\u1ecbnh Qu\u00e1n and the 2nd Battalion, 43rd Infantry, as well as the RF battalion were forced to withdraw with heavy losses on 18 March.<ref name=LeGro>{{cite book|last=Le Gro|first=William|title=Vietnam from ceasefire to capitulation|publisher=US Army Center of Military History|year=1985|isbn=9781410225429|url=https://history.army.mil/html/books/090/90-29/CMH_Pub_90-29.pdf}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>{{rp|167}}\n\nAlso on 17 March, the 3rd Battalion, 43rd Regiment killed 10 PAVN in heavy fighting northwest of Hoai Duc. At the same time another outpost of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c District, Ong Don, defended by an RF company and an artillery platoon, came under artillery and infantry attack. The PAVN assault was repulsed with heavy losses on both sides, and another RF company, sent to reinforce, ran into strong resistance on Highway 1 west of Ong Don. North of Ong Don, Gia Ray on Route 333 was under attack by the PAVN 274th Infantry Regiment, 6th Division. The 18th Division headquarters therefore realized that two PAVN divisions, the 6th and the 7th, were committed in Long Kh\u00e1nh. While the battle raged at Gia Ray, another post on Highway 1 west of Ong Don came under attack. Meanwhile, a bridge and a culvert on Highway 1 on each side of the Route 332 junction were blown up by PAVN sappers. Thus, all ARVN forces east of Route 332 were isolated from Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c by formidable obstacles and PAVN roadblocks. North from Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, on Route 20, hamlets along the road were occupied in varying degrees by PAVN soldiers, and the RF outpost far to the northeast near the Lam Dong boundary was overrun. \u0110\u1ea3o decided to counterattack up Route 20 with his 52nd Regiment, minus one battalion but reinforced with the 5th Armored Cavalry Squadron from T\u00e2y Ninh Province. The regiment was ordered to clear the road as far as \u0110\u1ecbnh Qu\u00e1n, but the attack quickly stalled as it met heavy resistance well short of its objective.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|167\u20139}}\n\nEvidence of increasing heavy PAVN commitments in Long Kh\u00e1nh flowed into [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps]] headquarters in Bien Hoa. The PAVN 141st Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, had apparently participated in the attack on \u0110\u1ecbnh Qu\u00e1n. Hoai Duc was overrun by the PAVN 812th Regiment, 6th Infantry Division, while that division's other two regiments, the 33rd and 274th, seized Gia Ray. The ARVN outpost on the conical peak of Chua Chan, standing {{convert|2200|ft}} above Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and providing excellent observation, also fell to PAVN 6th Infantry Division forces and Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c itself began to receive artillery fire, including [[M101 howitzer|105&nbsp;mm]] fire. III Corps commander Lieutenant general [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n To\u00e0n (general)|Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n To\u00e0n]] responded to the burgeoning threat on his eastern flank first by sending the 5th Armored Cavalry Squadron and then one battalion of the 48th Regiment from T\u00e2y Ninh to Long Kh\u00e1nh.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|169}} The rest of the 48th Regiment was still heavily engaged near Go Dau Ha. The 3rd Battalion made contact with a PAVN company west of the [[V\u00e0m C\u1ecf \u0110\u00f4ng River]] on 17 March, killed 36, and captured a number of weapons.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|169}} On 26 March To\u00e0n sent the headquarters and two battalions of the 48th Regiment to reinforce Khiem Hanh.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|169}}\n\nAfter capturing all key objectives surrounding Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c in Long Kh\u00e1nh Province, the PAVN 4th Army Corps had four days to prepare for the final push against the ARVN 18th Division. PAVN Major General [[Ho\u00e0ng C\u1ea7m (general)|Ho\u00e0ng C\u1ea7m]] personally took control of the operation; he decided to launch a full-frontal assault on Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c using his infantry, tank and artillery units from the north and northwest. [[Colonel]] Bui Cat Vu, deputy commander of the 4th Army Corps, would direct operations from the east.<ref name=Hoang>{{cite book|last=Hoang|first=Cam|title=The Journey of Ten Thousand Days|publisher=People's Army Publishing House|year=2001|isbn=}}</ref>{{rp|168}} While the PAVN were closing in on Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, \u0110\u1ea3o and the chief of Long Kh\u00e1nh Province, Colonel Nguyen Van Phuc, were also busy lining up their units in anticipation of the PAVN onslaught. Prior to the battle, \u0110\u1ea3o told foreign media that: ''\"I am determined to hold Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c. I don\u2019t care how many divisions the Communist will send against me, I will smash them all! The world shall see the strength and skill of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam\"''.<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|228\u20139}}\n\nOn 1 April, To\u00e0n returned the headquarters and two battalions of the 48th Regiment to the 18th Division. The regiment moved to the Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c area but sent its 2nd Battalion down to [[H\u00e0m T\u00e2n District]] on the coast of B\u00ecnh Tuy Province to secure the city and port while large numbers of refugees poured into the province from the north. About 500 troops, survivors of the ARVN [[2nd Division (South Vietnam)|2nd Division]], were among those arriving from I Corps. When reorganized and reequipped, they would take over the security mission in H\u00e0m T\u00e2n. The 52nd Regiment meanwhile was pressing forward on Route 20 south of \u0110\u1ecbnh Qu\u00e1n and in sharp fighting on 1 April killed over 50 PAVN troops. The 43rd Regiment was fighting east along Highway 1, near Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and in contact with a major PAVN force.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|172}}\n\nAfter the first PAVN attempt to seize Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c had been repulsed, the PAVN began a second assault on the town. At 05:40 on 9 April 1975, the PAVN 4th Army Corps began bombarding South Vietnamese positions around Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c firing about 4,000 rounds, in one of the heaviest artillery bombardments of the war. North of the town, the PAVN 341st Infantry Division captured the ARVN communications center and the local police station after more than one hour of heavy fighting.<ref name=Tran>{{cite book|last=Tran|first=Xuan Ban|title=History of the 7th Infantry Division|publisher=People's Army Publishing House|year=2006|isbn=|page=146}}</ref> However, all PAVN units moving down from the north were forced to stop when elements of the ARVN 52nd Task Force counter-attacked from the south. From the east, the PAVN 7th Infantry Division advanced on ARVN positions without tank support, so they sustained heavy casualties in the initial stages of the fighting. At 08:00 the 4th Army Corps Command sent eight tanks to support the 7th Infantry Division, but three were destroyed by entrenched ARVN soldiers at Bao Chanh A.<ref name=Tran/> By midday, the PAVN 209th and 270th Infantry Regiments captured the 18th Division headquarters and the Governor's Residence, which was defended by the ARVN 43rd and 48th Infantry Regiments, setting ablaze seven ARVN tanks in the process.<ref name=Tran/> In the south, the PAVN 6th Infantry Division attacked ARVN positions on Highway 1 from Hung Nghia to Me Bong Con, where they destroyed 11 tanks from the ARVN 322nd Armored Brigade.<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|382}} Throughout the day on 9 April, the 18th Division staged counter-attacks on the PAVN flanks to slow down their momentum, especially movements from the north and northwest.<ref name=Hoang/>{{rp|172}}\n\nThe PAVN resumed the attack on 10 April, this time committing the 165th Regiment of the 7th Infantry Division along with regiments of the 6th and 341st Divisions; again the attack failed. West of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, between [[Tr\u1ea3ng Bom District|Tr\u1ea3ng Bom]] and the intersection of Highways 1 and 20, the ARVN 322nd Task Force and 1st Airborne Brigade (two battalions) were trying to force their way east against stiff resistance. The PAVN attacked the rear base of the 52nd Regiment on Route 20, the 43rd Infantry in Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and the 82nd Ranger Battalion on 11 April, the third day of the battle. At that time the battalion of the 48th Regiment securing H\u00e0m T\u00e2n went back to Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and the 1st Airborne Brigade moved in closer to the town. Task Force 322 was making very slow progress opening the road from Tr\u1ea3ng Bom to Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and To\u00e0n ordered Task Force 315 from Cu Chi to reinforce. \n\nOn 12 April battalions of the 52nd Regiment were still in heavy fighting north of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, but the town, although demolished, was still held by the 43rd Regiment.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|135}} PAVN losses to that point were probably in excess of 800 killed, 5 captured, 300 weapons captured and 11 [[T-54]] tanks destroyed. ARVN casualties had been moderate. Most of the 43rd Regiment was holding east of the town; the 48th was southwest; the 1st Airborne Brigade was south but moving north toward the 82nd Ranger Battalion; and the 322 Task Force was on Route 1 west of the Route 20 junction attacking toward Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c. Two resupply missions were flown into the besieged town; on 12 April [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|CH-47]] helicopters brought in 93 tons of artillery ammunition and followed with 100 tons the next day. Meanwhile RVNAF airplanes flying against intense antiaircraft fire, took a heavy toll of the PAVN divisions around Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c flying over 200 [[sortie]]s. At 14:00 on 12 April RVNAF [[C-130 Hercules]] dropped two [[CBU-55]] [[Fuel Air Explosive]] bombs on PAVN positions in the town of Xuan Vinh, close to Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, killing about 200 PAVN soldiers.<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|384}} The Joint General Staff made the decision to bolster the defences at Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c with units drawn from the general reserve. Subsequently, the ARVN 1st Airborne Brigade arrived at the Bao Dinh rubber plantation, while two Marine battalions defended the eastern corridor leading to Bien Hoa. In addition, Tan Phong and Dau Giay received reinforcements from the 33rd Ranger Battalion, 8th Battalion, 5th Division, 8th Artillery Battalion and three armored brigades (315th, 318th and 322nd Armored Brigades). As the reinforcements were making their way onto the battlefield, RVNAF fighter-bombers from Bien Hoa and Tan Son Nhat flew between 80 and 120 combat sorties per day to support the defenders at Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|136\u20137}}<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|173\u20137}}\n\nOn 13 April Lieutenant general [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n Tr\u00e0]], arrived at the headquarters of the 4th Army Corps. During the meeting with other commanders, Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n Tr\u00e0 decided to alter certain aspects of the attack; the 6th Infantry Division and elements of the 341st Infantry Division would attack Dau Giay, which was the weakest point in the defensive line around Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, set up blocking positions along Highway 2 leading to [[B\u00e0 R\u1ecba]]\u2013[[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]], and Highway 1 between Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and Bien Hoa.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|138\u20139}} On the same day, the PAVN [[2nd Corps (Vietnam People's Army)|2nd Army Corps]] ordered the 95B Infantry Regiment to join the 4th Army Corps, in their efforts to capture Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c. As PAVN commanders began to implement their new strategy, the South Vietnamese military declared it had successfully repulsed the \"Communist attack\" on Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, thereby ending a period of continuous defeats. Thi\u1ec7u, buoyed by the fierce resistance of his army at Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, announced that the ARVN had \"recovered its fighting ability\" to defend the country.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|138\u20139}} The new attack began at 04:50 against the headquarters and 1st Battalion, 43rd Regiment, and lasted until 09:30. When the PAVN withdrew, they left 235 dead and about 30 weapons on the field. The attack picked up again at midday and lasted until 15:00, but the 43rd, with heavy RVNAF support held. Meanwhile the 1st Airborne Brigade continued to attack north toward Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and Task Force 322, now reinforced by the 315th and 316th Task Forces, struck from the west. RVNAF observers had discovered two batteries of [[130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46)|130&nbsp;mm]] guns northeast of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and attacked them. The PAVN continued sending additional forces into III Corps with the 320B and 325th Divisions moving to Long Kh\u00e1nh where they entered the battle on 15 April.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|173\u20137}} \n\nOn 15 April the situation on the battlefield began to change as PAVN artillery stopped their shelling of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, but started pounding Bien Hoa Air Base instead. In just one day, the RVNAF 3rd Air Force Division at Bien Hoa was forced to cease all operations due to continuous PAVN artillery bombardments. To continue their support of ground troops at Xuan Loc, the RVNAF mobilised the 4th Air Force Division based at [[Binh Thuy Air Base]] to conduct further missions.<ref name=Le>{{cite book|last=Le|first=Dai Anh Kiet|title=The Narratives of Saigon Generals|publisher=People's Police Publishing|year=2003|isbn=}}</ref>{{rp|181}} On the same day, an artillery bombardment of 1,000 rounds fell on the headquarters and 3rd Battalion, 52nd Regiment, an artillery battalion, and elements of the 5th Armored Cavalry Squadron, four 155&nbsp;mm and eight 105&nbsp;mm howitzers were destroyed, and the PAVN 6th Infantry Division and the 95B Infantry Regiment defeated a combined ARVN formation which included the 52nd Task Force and the 13th Armored Squadron west of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c. Between 16 and 17 April, the PAVN 6th Infantry Division and the 95B Infantry Regiment defeated the ARVN 8th Task Force and 3rd Armored Brigade, when the ARVN tried to recapture the military zone of Dau Giay. Around Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c the ARVN 43rd and 48th Infantry Regiments, as well as the 1st Airborne Brigade, suffered heavy casualties as PAVN infantry units attacked them from all sides.<ref name=Le/>{{rp|181}} The armored task forces on Route 1 had to pull back; half of their equipment had been destroyed. The 1st Airborne Brigade, frustrated in its attack toward Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, withdrew through the plantations and jungles toward B\u00e0 R\u1ecba in [[Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy Province]].<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|173\u20137}}\n\nWith Dau Giay and all the main roads under PAVN control, Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c was completely isolated, the 18th Division was cut off from reinforcements and surrounded by the PAVN 4th Army Corps. On 19 April the Joint General Staff ordered \u0110\u1ea3o to evacuate the 18th Division and other support units from Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c to a new defensive line formed east of Bien Hoa at the town of Tr\u1ea3ng Bom which was defended by the remnants of the Division, the 468th Marine Brigade and the reconstituted 258th Marine Brigade.<ref name=Veith/>{{rp|465}}<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|392\u20133}} On 20 April under the cover of heavy rain, South Vietnamese soldiers and civilians began pulling out from Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, in a convoy of about 200 military vehicles. On 21 April Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c was completely abandoned, with the ARVN 1st Airborne Brigade being the last unit to be evacuated from the area. At 04:00 on 21 April the 3rd Battalion, 1st Airborne Brigade was completely destroyed by the PAVN at the hamlet of Suoi Ca.

The loss of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c dealt a severe blow to the military strength of South Vietnam, which had lost almost every unit from its general reserve. On 18 April 1975, III Corps commander To\u00e0n, informed Thi\u1ec7u that the South Vietnamese forces at Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c had been beaten and South Vietnam's armed forces could only hold out for a few more days as a result of their losses on the battlefield.<ref name=Snepp/>{{rp|99}} According to North Vietnam's official account of the battle, about 2,036 South Vietnamese soldiers were either killed or wounded and another 2,731 were captured.<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|392}} Total casualties on the North Vietnamese side are largely unknown, but the 4th Army Corps alone claimed to have suffered 460 killed in action, and another 1,428 wounded.<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|369}} While \u0110\u1ea3o claimed that the battle cost the PAVN over 50,000 killed and 370 tanks destroyed, American estimates only put PAVN casualties at around 10 percent of those figures with 5,000 troops killed and/or wounded and 37 tanks destroyed.<ref name=Cao/>{{rp|132}}\n\n===Political outcome===\nIn the days following the loss of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, there was still much debate in both houses of South Vietnam's National Assembly about the country's wartime policies. Pro-war elements in the National Assembly argued South Vietnam should fight until the very end, in the belief that the United States would eventually give the country the necessary amount of aid to resist the North Vietnamese.<ref name=Dawson/>{{rp|66}} Anti-war elements, on the other hand, strongly opposed the idea. They believed the Government should negotiate with the North Vietnamese, in order to avoid a catastrophic defeat. Despite their differences of opinion, members in both houses of South Vietnam's National Assembly agreed that Thi\u1ec7u should be held responsible for the country's dire military and political situation, because his policies had allowed the North Vietnamese to easily penetrate South Vietnam's military defences.<ref name=Dawson/>{{rp|66}}\n\nFinally at 20:00 on 21 April 1975, Thi\u1ec7u officially resigned as the President of the Republic of Vietnam upon learning that Xuan Loc had fallen that morning.

The battle was fought between 9 and 21 April 1975, and ended when the town of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c was captured by the PAVN 4th Army Corps. This was the ARVN [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps]]' last defensive line of South Vietnam's capital, [[Saigon]]. The line connected the city of [[B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province|B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng]], [[Bien Hoa Air Base]], [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]], Long An and the lynchpin centered on the strategic town of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, where the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff committed the nation's final reserve forces in Saigon's defense. Once Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c fell on 21 April 1975, the PAVN battled with the last remaining elements of III Corps Armored Task Force, remnants of the 18th Infantry Division and depleted [[Republic of Vietnam Marine Division|Marine]], [[Republic of Vietnam Airborne Division|Airborne]] and [[Vietnamese Rangers|Ranger]] Battalions in a fighting retreat that lasted nine days, until they reached Saigon and PAVN armored columns crashed throughout the gates of South Vietnam's [[Independence Palace|Presidential Palace]] on 30 April 1975, effectively [[Fall of Saigon|ending the war]].\n\nFrom the beginning of 1975, PAVN forces swept through the northern provinces of South Vietnam virtually unopposed. In the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]], South Vietnam's [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II Corps]] was completely destroyed, whilst attempting to evacuate to the [[Mekong Delta]] region. In the cities of [[Hu\u1ebf]] and [[Da Nang]], ARVN units simply dissolved without putting up resistance. The devastating defeats suffered by the ARVN prompted South Vietnam's National Assembly to question President [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]]'s handling of the war, thereby placing him under tremendous pressure to resign.\n\nIn the last-ditch effort to save South Vietnam, Thi\u1ec7u ordered the 18th Infantry Division to hold Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c at all costs. The PAVN 4th Army Corps, on the other hand, was ordered to capture Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c in order to open the gateway to Saigon. During the early stages of the battle, the 18th Division managed to beat off early attempts by the PAVN to capture the town, forcing PAVN commanders to change their battle plan. However, on 19 April 1975, Dao's forces were ordered to withdraw after Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c was almost completely isolated, with all remaining units badly mauled. This defeat also marked the end of Thi\u1ec7u's political career, as he resigned on 21 April 1975.\n\n==Background==\nIn the first half of 1975, the government of the Republic of Vietnam was in deep political turmoil, which reflected the military situation on the battlefield. At least two assassination attempts specifically targeting President Thi\u1ec7u were foiled. On 23 January an ARVN officer tried to shoot Thi\u1ec7u with his pistol but failed. The officer was subsequently tried by a military court.<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|208}} On 4 April a [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] (RVNAF) pilot Nguyen Thanh Trung bombed the [[Independence Palace]] with his [[F-5 Tiger]]. It later turned out that the pilot had been an undercover member of the [[Viet Cong]] since 1969.<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|208}} Following those failed assassination attempts, Thi\u1ec7u grew suspicious of his own military commanders.<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|208}}\n\nOn 2 April the [[South Vietnamese Senate]] recommended the formation of a new government with [[Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00e1 C\u1ea9n]] as the new leader. As a result, Prime Minister [[Tr\u1ea7n Thi\u1ec7n Khi\u00eam]] resigned from his position. Thi\u1ec7u, in response to the Senate's recommendations, immediately approved Tran Thien Kiem's resignation and swore in Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00e1 C\u1ea9n as the new Prime Minister.<ref name=Snepp>{{cite book|last=Snepp|first=Frank|title=A Disastrous Retreat|publisher=Ho Chi Minh City Publishing|year=2001|isbn=}}</ref>{{rp|75}} On 4 April while announcing the changes of government on Saigon television, Thi\u1ec7u also ordered the arrest of three army commanders: [[Major general]] [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n Ph\u00fa]] for the [[Battle of Ban Me Thuot|loss of Ban Me Thuot]], General [[Ph\u1ea1m Qu\u1ed1c Thu\u1ea7n]] for his failure to hold [[Nha Trang]] and [[Lieutenant general]] [[D\u01b0 Qu\u1ed1c \u0110\u1ed1ng]] for the [[Battle of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long|loss of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long]].

Weyand]] on 3 April, Thi\u1ec7u outlined his final strategy to defend South Vietnam, vowing to hold what was left of his country. In his strategy, Thi\u1ec7u decided that Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c would be the center of his country's resistance, with [[T\u00e2y Ninh]] and [[Phan Rang\u2013Th\u00e1p Ch\u00e0m|Phan Rang]] on either side.<ref name=Dawson/>{{rp|59}} Eventually, the meeting became more intense when Thi\u1ec7u produced a letter written by former U.S. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], which promised military retaliation against North Vietnam if they violated the terms of the [[Paris Peace Accords]]. The meeting then concluded with Thi\u1ec7u accusing the United States Government of selling out his country the moment they signed the Paris Peace Accords.<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|208}}\n\nIn contrast to the situation faced by their opponents in Saigon, the North Vietnamese government were buoyed by the victories achieved by their armies since December 1974. By 8 April 1975, the PAVN had captured all the provinces in South Vietnam's I and II Corps, as well as [[Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long Province]]. While the South Vietnamese forces were disintegrating all over the battlefield, North Vietnam had two army corps moving towards the last South Vietnamese stronghold at Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c.<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|372}} The PAVN [[4th Corps (Vietnam People's Army)|4th Army Corps]], which overran Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long several months earlier, approached Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c from the north-east after they conquered T\u00e2y Ninh, [[B\u00ecnh Long]] and [[Long Kh\u00e1nh]]. The [[3rd Corps (Vietnam People's Army)|3rd Army Corps]], on the other hand, moved towards Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c from the north-west after they defeated the ARVN in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]].<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|372}} Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c was at the crossroads of Highway 1 (which ran the length of South Vietnam) and Highway 20 (which ran from the Central Highlands through [[Da Lat]]) and it controlled the eastern approach to the huge military bases at [[Bien Hoa Air Base|Bien Hoa]]/[[Long Binh Post|Long Binh]] and then Saigon.<ref name=Veith>{{cite book|last=Veith|first=George|title=Black April The Fall of South Vietnam 1973\u201375|publisher=Encounter Books|year=2012|isbn=9781594035722}}</ref>{{rp|436}}\n\n==Order of battle==\n===South Vietnam===\n[[File:Xuanloc 18th.jpg|thumb|General [[L\u00ea Minh \u0110\u1ea3o|Le Minh Dao]], ARVN commander at Xuan Loc]]\nOn 8 April 1975, the ARVN 18th Division was the main unit defending Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, composed of three infantry regiments: the 43rd, 48th and 52nd. There were also five armored [[brigade]]s, four regional force [[battalion]]s (340th, 342nd, 343rd and 367th Battalions), two artillery units (181st and 182nd Artillery Battalions) equipped with forty-two artillery guns, and two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of the [[People's Self-Defense Force]].<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|229\u201330}} On 12 April Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c was reinforced with the 1st Airborne Brigade, three armoured brigades (315th, 318th and 322nd Armored Brigades), the 8th Task Force from the [[5th Division (South Vietnam)|5th Division]] and the 33rd Ranger Battalion. Air support came in the form of two RVNAF divisions; the 5th Air Force Division based at Bien Hoa Air Base, and the 3rd Air Force Division at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]]. The commander at Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c was [[Brigadier general]] [[L\u00ea Minh \u0110\u1ea3o]].<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|229\u201330}}\n\n===North Vietnam===\nAs the PAVN 4th Army Corps was the first army to arrive on the battlefield at Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c the PAVN Central Military Committee decided that it would lead the assault. The 4th Army Corps fielded three divisions (6th, [[7th Infantry Division (Vietnam)|7th]] and [[341st Division (Vietnam)|341st]] Infantry Divisions). Those divisions had support from the 71st Anti-Aircraft Regiment, two [[combat engineer]]ing regiments (24th and 25th Engineering Regiments), the 26th Communications Regiment, two armored battalions, two artillery battalions, and two Long Kh\u00e1nh provincial infantry battalions.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|112}} On 3 April 1975, the 4th Army Corps Command came up with two options for attack; the first option would involve capturing all ARVN outposts in the surrounding areas and isolating the town center in the process. If the opportunity arose, the 4th Army Corps would launch a full frontal assault on the town center to capture all of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c. In the second option, if ARVN forces in Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c did not have the strength to resist, the 4th Army Corps would strike directly at the town center using infantry units, with armored and artillery units in support.<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|381}}\n\n==Prelude==\nIn March 1975 as the PAVN 3rd Army Corps attacked [[Ban Me Thuot]] in the Central Highlands, the PAVN 4th Army Corps also initiated their own operations against South Vietnamese forces in T\u00e2y Ninh and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng, in the southwestern regions of South Vietnam. Unlike the previous three years, South Vietnamese defences around T\u00e2y Ninh and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng were significantly weakened due to the lack of manpower and resources. Even though T\u00e2y Ninh and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng did not play a significant role in the defensive posture of South Vietnam, large ARVN units made their way into those areas as a result of the early defeats in 1975. T\u00e2y Ninh became a refuge for elements of the ARVN [[25th Division (South Vietnam)|25th Division]], four armored brigades and two Ranger battalions. B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng, on the other hand, hosted the ARVN 5th Division, one Ranger battalion and one armored brigade. To stop ARVN units from gathering in T\u00e2y Ninh and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng, and thereby regrouping for further resistance, the North Vietnamese decided to capture those regions.<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|219}}\n\nThe PAVN 4th Army Corps Command selected D\u1ea7u Ti\u1ebfng\u2013Chon Thanh as the first target for their operation, as it was the weakest point in the South Vietnamese defensive line in the north-west area. South Vietnam maintained four [[South Vietnamese Regional Force|Regional Force]] (RF) battalions (35th, 304th, 312th and 352nd Battalions) which totalled 2,600 soldiers in the area, along with one armored brigade and ten 105&nbsp;mm artillery guns.

The task of capturing D\u1ea7u Ti\u1ebfng\u2013Chon Thanh was entrusted to the PAVN [[9th Division (Vietnam)|9th Infantry Division]], whose strength were bolstered by the 16th Infantry Regiment, the 22nd Armored Battalion, one artillery battalion and one air-defence battalion. At 05:00 on 11 March the 9th Infantry Division commenced their attack on D\u1ea7u Ti\u1ebfng. ARVN artillery positions in Rung Nan, Bau Don and Cha La were the primary targets of the 9th Infantry Division on the first day of the attack.<ref name=Dinh>{{cite book|last=Dinh|first=Van Thien|title=Battles on the Doorstep of Saigon|publisher=People's Army Publishing House|year=2005|isbn=}}</ref>{{rp|3}}\n\nOn the afternoon of 11 March ARVN General [[L\u00ea Nguy\u00ean Khang]] ordered the 345th Armored Squadron to move out from Bau Don to relieve the military zone of D\u1ea7u Ti\u1ebfng, but they were defeated by the PAVN 16th Infantry Regiment at Suoi Ong Hung, and were forced to retreat to their base. At the same time, ARVN artillery units at Bau Don and Rung Nan were subdued by elements of the 9th Infantry Division, so they were unable to return fire.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|102}} By 13 March the PAVN was in complete control of the D\u1ea7u Ti\u1ebfng military zone. After three hours of fighting, the PAVN 9th Infantry Division also captured ARVN positions at Vuon Chuoi, Nga ba Sac, Cau Tau and Ben Cui. The ARVN 3rd Brigade had planned to retake D\u1ea7u Ti\u1ebfng using elements of the 5th Division, but Thi\u1ec7u ordered them to pull back and defend Truong Mit, Bau Don and T\u00e2y Ninh instead.<ref name=Dinh/>{{rp|3\u20135}}\n\nOn 24 March two regiments from the PAVN 9th Infantry Division, in coordination with two provincial infantry battalions from B\u00ecnh Ph\u01b0\u1edbc, attacked Ch\u01a1n Th\u00e0nh with full force but were repeatedly driven back from ARVN defensive lines. On 31 March the PAVN 4th Army Corps sent the 273rd Regiment and one artillery battalion equipped with 15 artillery guns to bolster the 9th Infantry Division. Following the arrival of these reinforcements, the PAVN continued their assault on the military zone of Ch\u01a1n Th\u00e0nh. South Vietnam responded by deploying the 3rd Armored Brigade to relieve Ch\u01a1n Th\u00e0nh, but they were stopped by elements of the 9th Infantry Division along Route 13.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|104\u20135}} To avoid destruction, all surviving members from the ARVN 31st Ranger Battalion retreated to Bau Don in the east. On 2 April the PAVN captured Ch\u01a1n Th\u00e0nh; they claimed to have killed 2,134 ARVN soldiers, as well as capturing 472 and shot down 16 aircraft.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|104\u20135}} In addition, North Vietnam captured 30 military vehicles (including eight tanks) and about 1,000 guns (including five artillery pieces) of various kinds. With the province of Binh Long firmly in their hands, the PAVN then set their sights on Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|104\u20135}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:HCMC5.jpg|thumb|Movement of North and South Vietnamese forces]]\nThe PAVN began their Long Kh\u00e1nh-B\u00ecnh Tuy campaign with strong attacks against ARVN positions on the two principal lines of communication in the region, Highways [[National Route 1A (Vietnam)|1]] and 20 striking outposts, towns, bridges and culverts north and east of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c. On 17 March, the PAVN 209th Infantry Regiment and the 210th Artillery Regiment, 7th Division, opened what was to become the Battle of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c. The 209th struck first at \u0110\u1ecbnh Qu\u00e1n, north of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, and at the La Nga bridge, west of \u0110\u1ecbnh Qu\u00e1n. Eight tanks supported the initial assault on \u0110\u1ecbnh Qu\u00e1n and PAVN artillery fire destroyed four [[M114 155 mm howitzer|155&nbsp;mm howitzers]] supporting the RF. Anticipating the attack, \u0110\u1ea3o had reinforced the La Nga bridge the day before, but the intense fire forced a withdrawal from the bridge. After repeated assaults, the 209th Infantry penetrated \u0110\u1ecbnh Qu\u00e1n and the 2nd Battalion, 43rd Infantry, as well as the RF battalion were forced to withdraw with heavy losses on 18 March.<ref name=LeGro>{{cite book|last=Le Gro|first=William|title=Vietnam from ceasefire to capitulation|publisher=US Army Center of Military History|year=1985|isbn=9781410225429|url=https://history.army.mil/html/books/090/90-29/CMH_Pub_90-29.pdf}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>{{rp|167}}\n\nAlso on 17 March, the 3rd Battalion, 43rd Regiment killed 10 PAVN in heavy fighting northwest of Hoai Duc. At the same time another outpost of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c District, Ong Don, defended by an RF company and an artillery platoon, came under artillery and infantry attack. The PAVN assault was repulsed with heavy losses on both sides, and another RF company, sent to reinforce, ran into strong resistance on Highway 1 west of Ong Don. North of Ong Don, Gia Ray on Route 333 was under attack by the PAVN 274th Infantry Regiment, 6th Division. The 18th Division headquarters therefore realized that two PAVN divisions, the 6th and the 7th, were committed in Long Kh\u00e1nh. While the battle raged at Gia Ray, another post on Highway 1 west of Ong Don came under attack. Meanwhile, a bridge and a culvert on Highway 1 on each side of the Route 332 junction were blown up by PAVN sappers. Thus, all ARVN forces east of Route 332 were isolated from Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c by formidable obstacles and PAVN roadblocks. North from Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, on Route 20, hamlets along the road were occupied in varying degrees by PAVN soldiers, and the RF outpost far to the northeast near the Lam Dong boundary was overrun. \u0110\u1ea3o decided to counterattack up Route 20 with his 52nd Regiment, minus one battalion but reinforced with the 5th Armored Cavalry Squadron from T\u00e2y Ninh Province. The regiment was ordered to clear the road as far as \u0110\u1ecbnh Qu\u00e1n, but the attack quickly stalled as it met heavy resistance well short of its objective.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|167\u20139}}\n\nEvidence of increasing heavy PAVN commitments in Long Kh\u00e1nh flowed into [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps]] headquarters in Bien Hoa. The PAVN 141st Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, had apparently participated in the attack on \u0110\u1ecbnh Qu\u00e1n. Hoai Duc was overrun by the PAVN 812th Regiment, 6th Infantry Division, while that division's other two regiments, the 33rd and 274th, seized Gia Ray. The ARVN outpost on the conical peak of Chua Chan, standing {{convert|2200|ft}} above Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and providing excellent observation, also fell to PAVN 6th Infantry Division forces and Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c itself began to receive artillery fire, including [[M101 howitzer|105&nbsp;mm]] fire. III Corps commander Lieutenant general [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n To\u00e0n (general)|Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n To\u00e0n]] responded to the burgeoning threat on his eastern flank first by sending the 5th Armored Cavalry Squadron and then one battalion of the 48th Regiment from T\u00e2y Ninh to Long Kh\u00e1nh.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|169}} The rest of the 48th Regiment was still heavily engaged near Go Dau Ha.

PAVN Major General [[Ho\u00e0ng C\u1ea7m (general)|Ho\u00e0ng C\u1ea7m]] personally took control of the operation; he decided to launch a full-frontal assault on Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c using his infantry, tank and artillery units from the north and northwest.

The world shall see the strength and skill of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam\"''.<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|228\u20139}}\n\nOn 1 April, To\u00e0n returned the headquarters and two battalions of the 48th Regiment to the 18th Division. The regiment moved to the Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c area but sent its 2nd Battalion down to [[H\u00e0m T\u00e2n District]] on the coast of B\u00ecnh Tuy Province to secure the city and port while large numbers of refugees poured into the province from the north. About 500 troops, survivors of the ARVN [[2nd Division (South Vietnam)|2nd Division]], were among those arriving from I Corps. When reorganized and reequipped, they would take over the security mission in H\u00e0m T\u00e2n. The 52nd Regiment meanwhile was pressing forward on Route 20 south of \u0110\u1ecbnh Qu\u00e1n and in sharp fighting on 1 April killed over 50 PAVN troops. The 43rd Regiment was fighting east along Highway 1, near Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and in contact with a major PAVN force.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|172}}\n\nAfter the first PAVN attempt to seize Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c had been repulsed, the PAVN began a second assault on the town. At 05:40 on 9 April 1975, the PAVN 4th Army Corps began bombarding South Vietnamese positions around Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c firing about 4,000 rounds, in one of the heaviest artillery bombardments of the war. North of the town, the PAVN 341st Infantry Division captured the ARVN communications center and the local police station after more than one hour of heavy fighting.<ref name=Tran>{{cite book|last=Tran|first=Xuan Ban|title=History of the 7th Infantry Division|publisher=People's Army Publishing House|year=2006|isbn=|page=146}}</ref> However, all PAVN units moving down from the north were forced to stop when elements of the ARVN 52nd Task Force counter-attacked from the south. From the east, the PAVN 7th Infantry Division advanced on ARVN positions without tank support, so they sustained heavy casualties in the initial stages of the fighting. At 08:00 the 4th Army Corps Command sent eight tanks to support the 7th Infantry Division, but three were destroyed by entrenched ARVN soldiers at Bao Chanh A.<ref name=Tran/> By midday, the PAVN 209th and 270th Infantry Regiments captured the 18th Division headquarters and the Governor's Residence, which was defended by the ARVN 43rd and 48th Infantry Regiments, setting ablaze seven ARVN tanks in the process.<ref name=Tran/> In the south, the PAVN 6th Infantry Division attacked ARVN positions on Highway 1 from Hung Nghia to Me Bong Con, where they destroyed 11 tanks from the ARVN 322nd Armored Brigade.<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|382}} Throughout the day on 9 April, the 18th Division staged counter-attacks on the PAVN flanks to slow down their momentum, especially movements from the north and northwest.<ref name=Hoang/>{{rp|172}}\n\nThe PAVN resumed the attack on 10 April, this time committing the 165th Regiment of the 7th Infantry Division along with regiments of the 6th and 341st Divisions; again the attack failed. West of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, between [[Tr\u1ea3ng Bom District|Tr\u1ea3ng Bom]] and the intersection of Highways 1 and 20, the ARVN 322nd Task Force and 1st Airborne Brigade (two battalions) were trying to force their way east against stiff resistance. The PAVN attacked the rear base of the 52nd Regiment on Route 20, the 43rd Infantry in Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and the 82nd Ranger Battalion on 11 April, the third day of the battle. At that time the battalion of the 48th Regiment securing H\u00e0m T\u00e2n went back to Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and the 1st Airborne Brigade moved in closer to the town. Task Force 322 was making very slow progress opening the road from Tr\u1ea3ng Bom to Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and To\u00e0n ordered Task Force 315 from Cu Chi to reinforce. \n\nOn 12 April battalions of the 52nd Regiment were still in heavy fighting north of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, but the town, although demolished, was still held by the 43rd Regiment.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|135}} PAVN losses to that point were probably in excess of 800 killed, 5 captured, 300 weapons captured and 11 [[T-54]] tanks destroyed. ARVN casualties had been moderate. Most of the 43rd Regiment was holding east of the town; the 48th was southwest; the 1st Airborne Brigade was south but moving north toward the 82nd Ranger Battalion; and the 322 Task Force was on Route 1 west of the Route 20 junction attacking toward Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c. Two resupply missions were flown into the besieged town; on 12 April [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|CH-47]] helicopters brought in 93 tons of artillery ammunition and followed with 100 tons the next day. Meanwhile RVNAF airplanes flying against intense antiaircraft fire, took a heavy toll of the PAVN divisions around Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c flying over 200 [[sortie]]s. At 14:00 on 12 April RVNAF [[C-130 Hercules]] dropped two [[CBU-55]] [[Fuel Air Explosive]] bombs on PAVN positions in the town of Xuan Vinh, close to Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, killing about 200 PAVN soldiers.<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|384}} The Joint General Staff made the decision to bolster the defences at Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c with units drawn from the general reserve. Subsequently, the ARVN 1st Airborne Brigade arrived at the Bao Dinh rubber plantation, while two Marine battalions defended the eastern corridor leading to Bien Hoa. In addition, Tan Phong and Dau Giay received reinforcements from the 33rd Ranger Battalion, 8th Battalion, 5th Division, 8th Artillery Battalion and three armored brigades (315th, 318th and 322nd Armored Brigades). As the reinforcements were making their way onto the battlefield, RVNAF fighter-bombers from Bien Hoa and Tan Son Nhat flew between 80 and 120 combat sorties per day to support the defenders at Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|136\u20137}}<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|173\u20137}}\n\nOn 13 April Lieutenant general [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n Tr\u00e0]], arrived at the headquarters of the 4th Army Corps. During the meeting with other commanders, Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n Tr\u00e0 decided to alter certain aspects of the attack; the 6th Infantry Division and elements of the 341st Infantry Division would attack Dau Giay, which was the weakest point in the defensive line around Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, set up blocking positions along Highway 2 leading to [[B\u00e0 R\u1ecba]]\u2013[[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]], and Highway 1 between Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and Bien Hoa.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|138\u20139}} On the same day, the PAVN [[2nd Corps (Vietnam People's Army)|2nd Army Corps]] ordered the 95B Infantry Regiment to join the 4th Army Corps, in their efforts to capture Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c. As PAVN commanders began to implement their new strategy, the South Vietnamese military declared it had successfully repulsed the \"Communist attack\" on Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, thereby ending a period of continuous defeats. Thi\u1ec7u, buoyed by the fierce resistance of his army at Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, announced that the ARVN had \"recovered its fighting ability\" to defend the country.<ref name=Ho/>{{rp|138\u20139}} The new attack began at 04:50 against the headquarters and 1st Battalion, 43rd Regiment, and lasted until 09:30. When the PAVN withdrew, they left 235 dead and about 30 weapons on the field. The attack picked up again at midday and lasted until 15:00, but the 43rd, with heavy RVNAF support held. Meanwhile the 1st Airborne Brigade continued to attack north toward Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and Task Force 322, now reinforced by the 315th and 316th Task Forces, struck from the west. RVNAF observers had discovered two batteries of [[130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46)|130&nbsp;mm]] guns northeast of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c and attacked them. The PAVN continued sending additional forces into III Corps with the 320B and 325th Divisions moving to Long Kh\u00e1nh where they entered the battle on 15 April.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|173\u20137}} \n\nOn 15 April the situation on the battlefield began to change as PAVN artillery stopped their shelling of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, but started pounding Bien Hoa Air Base instead. In just one day, the RVNAF 3rd Air Force Division at Bien Hoa was forced to cease all operations due to continuous PAVN artillery bombardments. To continue their support of ground troops at Xuan Loc, the RVNAF mobilised the 4th Air Force Division based at [[Binh Thuy Air Base]] to conduct further missions.<ref name=Le>{{cite book|last=Le|first=Dai Anh Kiet|title=The Narratives of Saigon Generals|publisher=People's Police Publishing|year=2003|isbn=}}</ref>{{rp|181}} On the same day, an artillery bombardment of 1,000 rounds fell on the headquarters and 3rd Battalion, 52nd Regiment, an artillery battalion, and elements of the 5th Armored Cavalry Squadron, four 155&nbsp;mm and eight 105&nbsp;mm howitzers were destroyed, and the PAVN 6th Infantry Division and the 95B Infantry Regiment defeated a combined ARVN formation which included the 52nd Task Force and the 13th Armored Squadron west of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c. Between 16 and 17 April, the PAVN 6th Infantry Division and the 95B Infantry Regiment defeated the ARVN 8th Task Force and 3rd Armored Brigade, when the ARVN tried to recapture the military zone of Dau Giay. Around Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c the ARVN 43rd and 48th Infantry Regiments, as well as the 1st Airborne Brigade, suffered heavy casualties as PAVN infantry units attacked them from all sides.<ref name=Le/>{{rp|181}} The armored task forces on Route 1 had to pull back; half of their equipment had been destroyed. The 1st Airborne Brigade, frustrated in its attack toward Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, withdrew through the plantations and jungles toward B\u00e0 R\u1ecba in [[Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy Province]].<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|173\u20137}}\n\nWith Dau Giay and all the main roads under PAVN control, Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c was completely isolated, the 18th Division was cut off from reinforcements and surrounded by the PAVN 4th Army Corps. On 19 April the Joint General Staff ordered \u0110\u1ea3o to evacuate the 18th Division and other support units from Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c to a new defensive line formed east of Bien Hoa at the town of Tr\u1ea3ng Bom which was defended by the remnants of the Division, the 468th Marine Brigade and the reconstituted 258th Marine Brigade.<ref name=Veith/>{{rp|465}}<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|392\u20133}} On 20 April under the cover of heavy rain, South Vietnamese soldiers and civilians began pulling out from Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, in a convoy of about 200 military vehicles. On 21 April Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c was completely abandoned, with the ARVN 1st Airborne Brigade being the last unit to be evacuated from the area. At 04:00 on 21 April the 3rd Battalion, 1st Airborne Brigade was completely destroyed by the PAVN at the hamlet of Suoi Ca. By the end of the day Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c was under North Vietnamese control and the gateway to Saigon was open.<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|392}}<ref name=Le/>{{rp|181\u20132}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Military outcome===\n[[File:Xuan Loc victory.jpg|thumb|The Xuan Loc victory monument dedicated to the [[People's Army of Vietnam]]]]\n\nFollowing their costly victory at Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, the PAVN effectively controlled two-thirds of South Vietnam's territory. The loss of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c dealt a severe blow to the military strength of South Vietnam, which had lost almost every unit from its general reserve. On 18 April 1975, III Corps commander To\u00e0n, informed Thi\u1ec7u that the South Vietnamese forces at Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c had been beaten and South Vietnam's armed forces could only hold out for a few more days as a result of their losses on the battlefield.<ref name=Snepp/>{{rp|99}} According to North Vietnam's official account of the battle, about 2,036 South Vietnamese soldiers were either killed or wounded and another 2,731 were captured.<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|392}} Total casualties on the North Vietnamese side are largely unknown, but the 4th Army Corps alone claimed to have suffered 460 killed in action, and another 1,428 wounded.<ref name=Pham/>{{rp|369}} While \u0110\u1ea3o claimed that the battle cost the PAVN over 50,000 killed and 370 tanks destroyed, American estimates only put PAVN casualties at around 10 percent of those figures with 5,000 troops killed and/or wounded and 37 tanks destroyed.<ref name=Cao/>{{rp|132}}\n\n===Political outcome===\nIn the days following the loss of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c, there was still much debate in both houses of South Vietnam's National Assembly about the country's wartime policies. Pro-war elements in the National Assembly argued South Vietnam should fight until the very end, in the belief that the United States would eventually give the country the necessary amount of aid to resist the North Vietnamese.<ref name=Dawson/>{{rp|66}} Anti-war elements, on the other hand, strongly opposed the idea. They believed the Government should negotiate with the North Vietnamese, in order to avoid a catastrophic defeat. Despite their differences of opinion, members in both houses of South Vietnam's National Assembly agreed that Thi\u1ec7u should be held responsible for the country's dire military and political situation, because his policies had allowed the North Vietnamese to easily penetrate South Vietnam's military defences.<ref name=Dawson/>{{rp|66}}\n\nFinally at 20:00 on 21 April 1975, Thi\u1ec7u officially resigned as the President of the Republic of Vietnam upon learning that Xuan Loc had fallen that morning. In his final effort to save South Vietnam, Thi\u1ec7u gambled his political career by sending the very last units of the ARVN to Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c in an attempt to hold off the PAVN.<ref name=Dawson/>{{rp|66}} Ultimately, however, Thi\u1ec7u's effort came too late. [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n H\u01b0\u01a1ng]] was appointed as President, and he was ordered to seek a negotiated peace with North Vietnam at any cost, to the disappointment of many in South Vietnam's political elite, who argued that the situation could have been different if Thi\u1ec7u had gone earlier.<ref name=Duong/>{{rp|241\u20132}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Nguyen Van Bieu.

Erected initially in 1847 as the Diocese of Melbourne, a [[suffragan diocese]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney|Archdiocese of Sydney]], the diocese was elevated in 1874 as an archdiocese of the [[Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Melbourne|Ecclesiastical Province of Melbourne]] and is the metropolitan for the suffragan dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sale|Sale]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sandhurst|Sandhurst]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ballarat|Ballarat]], and the [[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Ss Peter and Paul]].  The [[Archdiocese of Hobart]] is attached to the archdiocese for administrative purposes. [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Patrick's Cathedral]] is the seat of the Archbishop of Melbourne, currently [[Peter Comensoli]], who succeeded [[Denis James Hart|Denis Hart]] on 1 August 2018.\n\nAccording to the 2006 Commonwealth Census figures, there were 4,932,423 people within the province. Of these, 1,349,828 were Catholic, about 28% of the population.<ref name=facts>{{cite web |url=http://www.cam.org.au/church-in-melbourne/facts.html |work=Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne |title=Facts }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nWhen Melbourne, then called the Port Philip Settlement, and the surrounding area was being settled by European settlers in the 1830s, the area was a part of the [[Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Sydney]] in the Archdiocese of Sydney. In 1839, [[John Polding]], the Archbishop of Sydney, placed [[Patrick Bonaventure Geoghegan]] in charge of the Port Philip Settlement and the first Mass was celebrated in Melbourne on Pentecost Sunday, 15 May 1839. The entire population of Port Philip in 1841 was 11,738 and the Catholics numbered 2,411.<ref name=CathEnc>[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Melbourne|Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Melbourne]]</ref>\n\nThe oldest surviving Catholic church in Victoria, [[St Francis Catholic Church (Melbourne)|St Francis Catholic Church]], was built in 1841.\n\nThe Diocese of Melbourne was created in 1848 out of territory of the then Sydney archdiocese, with [[James Alipius Goold]] as its first bishop. The Catholic population of the colony was 18,000 in 1851 and had grown to 88,000 by 1857 as a result of the [[gold rush]].<ref name=CathEnc /> James Goold was also instrumental in setting up many Catholic schools in the diocese and in introducing several religious orders devoted to education and works of charity, including the [[Society of Jesus]], the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Christian Brothers]], the [[Sisters of Mercy]], the [[Good Shepherd Nuns]], the [[Presentation Sisters]], the  [[Faithful Companions of Jesus]] and the [[Little Sisters of the Poor]].<ref name=CathEnc />\n\nWhen Goold was appointed Bishop of Melbourne in 1848, St Francis' Church became the cathedral church of the new diocese. Construction of a new church on Eastern Hill in East Melbourne commenced in 1858, to be called St Patrick's Cathedral. Construction of the cathedral was not completed until 1939.\n\nOn 30 March 1874, the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] (comprising four parishes) and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ballarat|Ballarat]] were formed out of territory of the Diocese of Melbourne, with it becoming a metropolitan archdiocese of the Ecclesiastical Province of Melbourne and responsible for Sandhurst and Ballarat dioceses as [[suffragan diocese]]s. The suffragan [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sale|Diocese of Sale]] was similarly formed on 26 April 1887 out of the archdiocese.\n\nUnder Goold's successor, [[Thomas Joseph Carr]], additional teaching orders were introduced to the archdiocese, including the [[Marist Brothers]], the [[Sisters of Charity of Australia|Sisters of Charity]], the [[Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart]], the [[Sisters of Loreto]], the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] and the [[Sisters of the Good Samaritan]]. In 1887, 11,661 pupils attended Catholic schools of the archdiocese and that number had grown to 25,369 by 1908. The Catholic population of the archdiocese according to government census returns of 1901 was 145,333.<ref name=CathEnc />\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, the Catholics of the archdiocese were almost all Irish or of Irish origin, when expansion of the migration programs saw the arrival of non-Irish Catholics from continental Europe. The priesthood was exclusively Irish until the early part of the 20th century, when training of native born priests began.\n\n==Ordinaries==\nThe following individuals were Archbishops of Melbourne, with one being a [[Cardinal-Priest|cardinal]] while in office as archbishop, as well as having civilian honours.

Erected initially in 1847 as the Diocese of Melbourne, a [[suffragan diocese]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney|Archdiocese of Sydney]], the diocese was elevated in 1874 as an archdiocese of the [[Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Melbourne|Ecclesiastical Province of Melbourne]] and is the metropolitan for the suffragan dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sale|Sale]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sandhurst|Sandhurst]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ballarat|Ballarat]], and the [[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Ss Peter and Paul]].  The [[Archdiocese of Hobart]] is attached to the archdiocese for administrative purposes. [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Patrick's Cathedral]] is the seat of the Archbishop of Melbourne, currently [[Peter Comensoli]], who succeeded [[Denis James Hart|Denis Hart]] on 1 August 2018.\n\nAccording to the 2006 Commonwealth Census figures, there were 4,932,423 people within the province. Of these, 1,349,828 were Catholic, about 28% of the population.<ref name=facts>{{cite web |url=http://www.cam.org.au/church-in-melbourne/facts.html |work=Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne |title=Facts }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nWhen Melbourne, then called the Port Philip Settlement, and the surrounding area was being settled by European settlers in the 1830s, the area was a part of the [[Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Sydney]] in the Archdiocese of Sydney. In 1839, [[John Polding]], the Archbishop of Sydney, placed [[Patrick Bonaventure Geoghegan]] in charge of the Port Philip Settlement and the first Mass was celebrated in Melbourne on Pentecost Sunday, 15 May 1839. The entire population of Port Philip in 1841 was 11,738 and the Catholics numbered 2,411.<ref name=CathEnc>[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Melbourne|Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Melbourne]]</ref>\n\nThe oldest surviving Catholic church in Victoria, [[St Francis Catholic Church (Melbourne)|St Francis Catholic Church]], was built in 1841.\n\nThe Diocese of Melbourne was created in 1848 out of territory of the then Sydney archdiocese, with [[James Alipius Goold]] as its first bishop. The Catholic population of the colony was 18,000 in 1851 and had grown to 88,000 by 1857 as a result of the [[gold rush]].<ref name=CathEnc /> James Goold was also instrumental in setting up many Catholic schools in the diocese and in introducing several religious orders devoted to education and works of charity, including the [[Society of Jesus]], the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Christian Brothers]], the [[Sisters of Mercy]], the [[Good Shepherd Nuns]], the [[Presentation Sisters]], the  [[Faithful Companions of Jesus]] and the [[Little Sisters of the Poor]].<ref name=CathEnc />\n\nWhen Goold was appointed Bishop of Melbourne in 1848, St Francis' Church became the cathedral church of the new diocese. Construction of a new church on Eastern Hill in East Melbourne commenced in 1858, to be called St Patrick's Cathedral. Construction of the cathedral was not completed until 1939.\n\nOn 30 March 1874, the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] (comprising four parishes) and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ballarat|Ballarat]] were formed out of territory of the Diocese of Melbourne, with it becoming a metropolitan archdiocese of the Ecclesiastical Province of Melbourne and responsible for Sandhurst and Ballarat dioceses as [[suffragan diocese]]s. The suffragan [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sale|Diocese of Sale]] was similarly formed on 26 April 1887 out of the archdiocese.\n\nUnder Goold's successor, [[Thomas Joseph Carr]], additional teaching orders were introduced to the archdiocese, including the [[Marist Brothers]], the [[Sisters of Charity of Australia|Sisters of Charity]], the [[Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart]], the [[Sisters of Loreto]], the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] and the [[Sisters of the Good Samaritan]]. In 1887, 11,661 pupils attended Catholic schools of the archdiocese and that number had grown to 25,369 by 1908. The Catholic population of the archdiocese according to government census returns of 1901 was 145,333.<ref name=CathEnc />\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, the Catholics of the archdiocese were almost all Irish or of Irish origin, when expansion of the migration programs saw the arrival of non-Irish Catholics from continental Europe. The priesthood was exclusively Irish until the early part of the 20th century, when training of native born priests began.\n\n==Ordinaries==\nThe following individuals were Archbishops of Melbourne, with one being a [[Cardinal-Priest|cardinal]] while in office as archbishop, as well as having civilian honours.
