The series was written and recorded at [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018143401/http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archive-date=October 18, 2014|work=[[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]]|title=Janice Burgess, ''The Backyardigans''|date=2016}}</ref> with animation provided by [[Nelvana]]. It centers on a group of five anthropomorphic best friends who use their imaginations to embark on fantastic adventures in their shared backyard. Each episode is set to a different musical genre like reggae, country, or rock, and features at least four songs, written by various songwriters and performed by the characters with original dance choreography.\n\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot produced in 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html|title=Rick Lyon: Nickelodeon \"Me and My Friends\" Meercats|work=lyonpuppets.com}}</ref> titled ''Me and My Friends''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/CREDITS3.html|title=Yvette Helin Studio - Credits|work=yvettehelinstudio.com}}</ref> The pilot featured life-sized puppets who danced to songs on an indoor stage. In 2001, Nickelodeon's studio in New York retooled the concept into an animated pilot, using [[motion capture]] techniques to animate the dances. The newer pilot was greenlit, and the series entered production as a co-production between Nickelodeon and Nelvana. Nickelodeon called the show \"a home-grown Nick Jr. property,\" as \"the whole creative team... [had] been part of the Nick Jr. family for years.\"<ref name=\"oct11\"/> \n\nA total of 80 episodes were produced across four seasons, each containing 20 episodes. The series first previewed on [[Treehouse TV]] in Canada on September 11, 2004,<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|title=Treehouse TV programme schedule: September 6\u201312, 2004|work=[[Treehouse TV]]|publisher=[[Corus Entertainment]]|accessdate=July 23, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040908024533/http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|archivedate=September 8, 2004|quote=Saturday, September 11, 2004 at 2:30 PM: ''Backyardigans''}}</ref> followed by its official debut on Nickelodeon's [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] block on October 11, 2004.<ref name=\"oct11\"/> The fourth season wrapped production in 2010 and finished airing on Nick Jr. on July 12, 2013.<ref name=\"jul12\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nEach episode follows a similar pattern and centers around a group of five friends: Pablo, Tyrone, Uniqua, Tasha, and Austin. The characters introduce themselves in their backyard before imagining a new location to enter. The group is often presented with multiple dilemmas along the way to accomplishing a certain goal or priority, or may be challenged with a major single obstacle to defeat or problem to solve. After season one, there is usually a villain in the episode, mainly played by one of the Backyardigans (thus another Backyardigan plays the role of the hero), but the villain of the episode always reforms in the end. The program also follows a musical format, featuring multiple musical numbers performed in the style of a different genre and sung throughout the course of an episode regarding whatever imaginary predicament in which the characters have situated themselves or perhaps a challenge that they have met, every episode opening and concluding with a particular song. The adventures get more advanced after the first season. When the Backyardigans have achieved their mission or defeated any disadvantages, the fantasy sequence fades, restoring actuality to the setting of the episodes as the closing song is sung, the characters scurrying to their houses for a snack. The main character or characters then opens the snack host's house door, fence, or around the corner, and shouts the main catchphrase for the last time and then closes the door. The picture then is lifeless with some background bird noises often heard as iris closes, ending the episode before the credits roll.\n\n==Characters==\nEach of the five characters on the show have two voice actors: one for speaking, and the other for singing.\n\nThe dancing on the show is first performed by live-action dancers, and their movements are later transported to animation. Choreographer, Beth Bogush, describes the process: \"What we do is we film the live footage in the studio, send that off and they do a [[Traditional animation#Layout|Leica]], and then they send it to the animators. The animators watch, and were pretty precise. What we film for that day is pretty close to what you see in the character.\"<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1542683,00.html|title=Who gets those 'toon-toed ''Backyardigans'' to dance? |last=Clarke|first=Eileen |date=October 4, 2006 |work=Bring It On |publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> In season one, the Backyardigans usually wear their normal clothes while on an adventure, usually accompanied with accessories. They rarely wear their normal clothes in an adventure after the first season.\n\n===Main===\n<!-- Any speculation about the character's species will be removed. -->\n* Uniqua is a curious, self-confident, and high-spirited, pink, spotted character. The series uses the name \"Uniqua\" for both the character and her species. She wears pink, polka-dotted [[overalls]] and has a pair of swirled [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] on top of her head. Uniqua is sweet and friendly, though her strong opinions and occasional stubbornness get in the way of her relationships. While imagining herself having the roles that require brains and fortitude (such as a scientist or pirate captain) and despite her love of books (as seen in episodes such as \"The Masked Retriever\"). Creator [[Janice Burgess]] describes Uniqua as the child she wishes she was like as a child.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Burgess |first=Janice |url=http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml |title=Meet the Creator of The Backyardigans! |publisher=NickJr.com |accessdate=2008-12-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820062324/http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml|archivedate=August 20, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> She is the only main character to appear in every episode. Speaking voice: [[Lashawn Tin\u00e1h Jefferies]]. Singing voice: [[Jamia Simone Nash]] (seasons 1\u20133) and Avion Baker (season 4). Dancer: Hattie Mae Williams.\n* Pablo is a yellow-beaked, blue [[penguin]] who wears a blue bow tie and a blue-and-yellow propeller [[Beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]]. He is very respectable and often acts on his own accord. Pablo tends to be the most excitable of the group and is best friends with Tyrone and Uniqua. Due to his energy and impetuousness, he often goes into a \"panic attack\" when he faces an obstacle, running around in circles and telling everyone not to worry until someone interrupts him. The number of panic attacks decreased considerably after season 1, though in the episode ''[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#The Flipper!|The Flipper!]],'' his propensity for getting overexcited is a major plot point. He also usually plays the villain in his friends' games. Pablo does not appear one time: \"[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#Chichen-Itza Pizza|Chichen-Itza Pizza]]\". Speaking voice: [[Zach Tyler Eisen]] (season 1) and Jake Goldberg (seasons 2\u20134). Singing voice: Sean Curley. Dancer: Tasha Cooper (seasons 1\u20133), Jonathan Sandler (season 3), Steven Konopelski (seasons 3\u20134), Jacob Wimar (season 4), and Paul Flanagan (season 4).\n* Tyrone is a good-natured, yet somewhat fearful, red-haired orange [[moose]] who wears a red-and-blue striped shirt, and is best friends with Pablo and Uniqua. He is almost the complete opposite of Pablo in terms of personality, with his laid-back and cool-headed character. Tyrone is known for his sarcastic comments, one of them being \"That certainly was convenient.\" At the end of most episodes, when he appears, he says \"That was an excellent ''(type)'' adventure, don't you think?\" (though Pablo, Austin, and Tasha recite the line when he does not appear). Despite not appearing to wear trousers (except on rare occasions), Tyrone somehow manages to put his hands in his pockets. Speaking voice: Reginald Davis Jr. (season 1), [[Jordan Coleman]] (seasons 2\u20133), and Christopher Grant, Jr. (season 4). Singing voice: [[Corwin C. Tuggles]] (season 1), [[Leon Thomas III]] (seasons 2\u20133), Damani Roberts (season 3) and [[Tyrel Jackson Williams]] (season 3-4). Dancer: Greg Sinacori (seasons 1\u20132, 4), Bradley Shelver (season 3), and Andrew Cao (season 3).\n* Tasha is a strong-willed, yellow [[hippo]]. Tasha wears an orange, flowered dress and red Mary-Jane shoes. She is a sweet girl on the outside, but is rational and likes to get her own way. She is the most serious of the major characters, although Tasha can be just as easygoing as the others from time to time. She is more feminine than her good friend Uniqua. In seasons 2-4, she has a more amiable personality. She tends to be grumpy if she is not the boss. Her catchphrase is \"Oh, for goodness sakes!\" Speaking voice: [[Naelee Rae]] (seasons 1\u20132) and Gianna Bruzzese (seasons 3\u20134). Singing voice: Kristin Danielle Klabunde (seasons 1\u20133) and Gabriella Malek (seasons 3\u20134). Dancer: Darlene Dirstine (seasons 1\u20133), Amanda Ulibarri (season 4), and Nancy Renee Braun (season 4).\n* Austin is a shy but fun-loving purple [[kangaroo]]. Though generally soft-spoken in Season 1, due to recently moving into the neighborhood, Austin starts to come out of his shell as the series progresses. He is revealed to be smart and imaginative. Austin rarely appears in the spotlight, but takes the role of the lead character in several episodes. His catchphrase varies from show to show. In more than one episode, he refers to himself as \"Just Austin.\" Says Bogush: \"Austin's usually the one pulling up the rear. He's kind of a get-along guy.\"<ref name=\"ref1\"/> Austin has been shown to occasionally display a more villainous side, such as in the episodes \"High Tea\" and \"The Magic Skateboard\". Speaking voice: [[Jonah Bobo]]. Singing voice: Thomas Sharkey (seasons 1\u20133) and Nicholas Barasch (season 4). Dancer: Kristen Frost.\n\n===Recurring===\n*Sherman \u2013 A small, orange-spotted yellow male member. Sherman is easily scared due to his small size. He appears in \"The Heart of the Jungle\", \"Polka Palace Party\", and \"Attack of the 50 Foot Worman\". His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Wormans \u2013 A fictional species of colorful, worm-like creatures who speak in squeaks and gibberish. They appear in all the seasons of the show.\n*Dragon \u2013 A friendly, green-colored dragon who appears three times (the movie \"Tale of the Mighty Knights\" and the episode \"The Tale of the Not-So-Nice Dragon\"). He hatched from a spotted egg and lives inside of Dragon Mountain. His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Aliens \u2013 Green-colored aliens with eyestalks appear four times: \"Mission to Mars\", \"News Flash\", \"Los Galacticos\", and \"The Big Dipper Diner\".\n*Giant clam \u2013 A hungry, irritable clam who appears in \"The Legend of the Volcano Sisters\" and \"The Great Dolphin Race\". It is very protective of its pearl. It pants and acts like a dog.\n*Voices \u2013 Voices were included in the episodes \"Secret Mission\" and \"It's Great To Be A Ghost!\" that do not come from any shown character.\n*Robot Roscoe \u2013 A robot owned by Austin who appears three times in the fourth season (the movie \"Robot Rampage\" and the episode \"Elephant on the Run\"). His voice is provided by Evan Mathew Weinstein.\n\n==Setting==\nThe characters live in houses adjoining a large backyard common to the three central houses (Uniqua's, Pablo's and Tyrone's) that is transformed by imagination into various adventure settings. Each house roughly corresponds to the color scheme of the character: Uniqua in a pink house, Pablo lives in a blue one, and Tyrone in an orange one. Tasha's house, which is to the left of the three central houses, is yellow and Austin's, to the right, is partially obscured by a fence but what is visible is purple. The fence, which surrounds the combined properties of the three main characters (Uniqua, Pablo and Tyrone), has a gate in it which leads to Austin's house. The curve of the cul-de-sac allows the play area to be roughly equal in distance from each house's back door.\n\nNot everything that appears in the imaginary world has a real-world counterpart. Often [[tree]]s, [[boulder]]s, brickwork, or similar objects appear where nothing originally existed. By the same token, even large trees in the real garden disappear completely when the imagination part of the story commences.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n{{:List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n\n==Production==\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot titled \"Me and My Friends,\" produced at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in September 1998.<ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/GalleryMotionPictures/MOTIONPICTURESGALLERY.htm| title=Me and My Friends Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios| publisher=Yvette Helin Studio| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot, Rick Lyon with Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html| title=Me and My Friends Pilot, Rick Lyon Puppeteer| publisher=Rick Lyon| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was rejected by Nickelodeon, and the concept was reworked into an animated short in 2002.<ref name=\"Backyardigans, 2002\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.tmfile.com/mark/?q=7814102| title=Backyardigans, 2002| publisher=TMFile| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was greenlit by Nickelodeon to become a full-length series.

There is also a [[LeapFrog]] [[ClickStart]] game titled \"Number Pie Samurai,\" teaching children basic computer skills.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, [[Kohl's]] had a section devoted to the series' merchandise, including a clothing line and toys exclusively in store.\n\nOver one hundred storybooks (both original stories and episode-based) were released throughout the series' run.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/backyardigans?No=20&Nrpp=20&_requestid=265936&fs=0|title=The Backyardigans - Barnes & Noble|author=Barnes & Noble|work=Barnes & Noble}}</ref> Most of these were released in both Canada and the United States; however, a 2006 series of educational books were exclusively sold in Canada under the license of [[Treehouse TV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.busyhandseducation.com/product/the-backyardigans-thinking-skills/|title=Treehouse TV Backyardigans Books|author=Busy Hands Education|work=BusyHandsEducation.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Fisher-Price]] produced numerous plush toys and interactive character toys (mostly Uniqua, Pablo and Tyrone).

The series was written and recorded at [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018143401/http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archive-date=October 18, 2014|work=[[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]]|title=Janice Burgess, ''The Backyardigans''|date=2016}}</ref> with animation provided by [[Nelvana]]. It centers on a group of five anthropomorphic best friends who use their imaginations to embark on fantastic adventures in their shared backyard. Each episode is set to a different musical genre like reggae, country, or rock, and features at least four songs, written by various songwriters and performed by the characters with original dance choreography.\n\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot produced in 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html|title=Rick Lyon: Nickelodeon \"Me and My Friends\" Meercats|work=lyonpuppets.com}}</ref> titled ''Me and My Friends''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/CREDITS3.html|title=Yvette Helin Studio - Credits|work=yvettehelinstudio.com}}</ref> The pilot featured life-sized puppets who danced to songs on an indoor stage. In 2001, Nickelodeon's studio in New York retooled the concept into an animated pilot, using [[motion capture]] techniques to animate the dances. The newer pilot was greenlit, and the series entered production as a co-production between Nickelodeon and Nelvana. Nickelodeon called the show \"a home-grown Nick Jr. property,\" as \"the whole creative team... [had] been part of the Nick Jr. family for years.\"<ref name=\"oct11\"/> \n\nA total of 80 episodes were produced across four seasons, each containing 20 episodes. The series first previewed on [[Treehouse TV]] in Canada on September 11, 2004,<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|title=Treehouse TV programme schedule: September 6\u201312, 2004|work=[[Treehouse TV]]|publisher=[[Corus Entertainment]]|accessdate=July 23, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040908024533/http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|archivedate=September 8, 2004|quote=Saturday, September 11, 2004 at 2:30 PM: ''Backyardigans''}}</ref> followed by its official debut on Nickelodeon's [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] block on October 11, 2004.<ref name=\"oct11\"/> The fourth season wrapped production in 2010 and finished airing on Nick Jr. on July 12, 2013.<ref name=\"jul12\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nEach episode follows a similar pattern and centers around a group of five friends: Pablo, Tyrone, Uniqua, Tasha, and Austin. The characters introduce themselves in their backyard before imagining a new location to enter. The group is often presented with multiple dilemmas along the way to accomplishing a certain goal or priority, or may be challenged with a major single obstacle to defeat or problem to solve. After season one, there is usually a villain in the episode, mainly played by one of the Backyardigans (thus another Backyardigan plays the role of the hero), but the villain of the episode always reforms in the end. The program also follows a musical format, featuring multiple musical numbers performed in the style of a different genre and sung throughout the course of an episode regarding whatever imaginary predicament in which the characters have situated themselves or perhaps a challenge that they have met, every episode opening and concluding with a particular song. The adventures get more advanced after the first season. When the Backyardigans have achieved their mission or defeated any disadvantages, the fantasy sequence fades, restoring actuality to the setting of the episodes as the closing song is sung, the characters scurrying to their houses for a snack. The main character or characters then opens the snack host's house door, fence, or around the corner, and shouts the main catchphrase for the last time and then closes the door. The picture then is lifeless with some background bird noises often heard as iris closes, ending the episode before the credits roll.\n\n==Characters==\nEach of the five characters on the show have two voice actors: one for speaking, and the other for singing.\n\nThe dancing on the show is first performed by live-action dancers, and their movements are later transported to animation. Choreographer, Beth Bogush, describes the process: \"What we do is we film the live footage in the studio, send that off and they do a [[Traditional animation#Layout|Leica]], and then they send it to the animators. The animators watch, and were pretty precise. What we film for that day is pretty close to what you see in the character.\"<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1542683,00.html|title=Who gets those 'toon-toed ''Backyardigans'' to dance? |last=Clarke|first=Eileen |date=October 4, 2006 |work=Bring It On |publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> In season one, the Backyardigans usually wear their normal clothes while on an adventure, usually accompanied with accessories. They rarely wear their normal clothes in an adventure after the first season.\n\n===Main===\n<!-- Any speculation about the character's species will be removed. -->\n* Uniqua is a curious, self-confident, and high-spirited, pink, spotted character. The series uses the name \"Uniqua\" for both the character and her species. She wears pink, polka-dotted [[overalls]] and has a pair of swirled [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] on top of her head. Uniqua is sweet and friendly, though her strong opinions and occasional stubbornness get in the way of her relationships. While imagining herself having the roles that require brains and fortitude (such as a scientist or pirate captain) and despite her love of books (as seen in episodes such as \"The Masked Retriever\"). Creator [[Janice Burgess]] describes Uniqua as the child she wishes she was like as a child.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Burgess |first=Janice |url=http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml |title=Meet the Creator of The Backyardigans! |publisher=NickJr.com |accessdate=2008-12-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820062324/http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml|archivedate=August 20, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> She is the only main character to appear in every episode. Speaking voice: [[Lashawn Tin\u00e1h Jefferies]]. Singing voice: [[Jamia Simone Nash]] (seasons 1\u20133) and Avion Baker (season 4). Dancer: Hattie Mae Williams.\n* Pablo is a yellow-beaked, blue [[penguin]] who wears a blue bow tie and a blue-and-yellow propeller [[Beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]]. He is very respectable and often acts on his own accord. Pablo tends to be the most excitable of the group and is best friends with Tyrone and Uniqua. Due to his energy and impetuousness, he often goes into a \"panic attack\" when he faces an obstacle, running around in circles and telling everyone not to worry until someone interrupts him. The number of panic attacks decreased considerably after season 1, though in the episode ''[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#The Flipper!|The Flipper!]],'' his propensity for getting overexcited is a major plot point. He also usually plays the villain in his friends' games. Pablo does not appear one time: \"[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#Chichen-Itza Pizza|Chichen-Itza Pizza]]\". Speaking voice: [[Zach Tyler Eisen]] (season 1) and Jake Goldberg (seasons 2\u20134). Singing voice: Sean Curley. Dancer: Tasha Cooper (seasons 1\u20133), Jonathan Sandler (season 3), Steven Konopelski (seasons 3\u20134), Jacob Wimar (season 4), and Paul Flanagan (season 4).\n* Tyrone is a good-natured, yet somewhat fearful, red-haired orange [[moose]] who wears a red-and-blue striped shirt, and is best friends with Pablo and Uniqua. He is almost the complete opposite of Pablo in terms of personality, with his laid-back and cool-headed character. Tyrone is known for his sarcastic comments, one of them being \"That certainly was convenient.\" At the end of most episodes, when he appears, he says \"That was an excellent ''(type)'' adventure, don't you think?\" (though Pablo, Austin, and Tasha recite the line when he does not appear). Despite not appearing to wear trousers (except on rare occasions), Tyrone somehow manages to put his hands in his pockets. Speaking voice: Reginald Davis Jr. (season 1), [[Jordan Coleman]] (seasons 2\u20133), and Christopher Grant, Jr. (season 4). Singing voice: [[Corwin C. Tuggles]] (season 1), [[Leon Thomas III]] (seasons 2\u20133), Damani Roberts (season 3) and [[Tyrel Jackson Williams]] (season 3-4). Dancer: Greg Sinacori (seasons 1\u20132, 4), Bradley Shelver (season 3), and Andrew Cao (season 3).\n* Tasha is a strong-willed, yellow [[hippo]]. Tasha wears an orange, flowered dress and red Mary-Jane shoes. She is a sweet girl on the outside, but is rational and likes to get her own way. She is the most serious of the major characters, although Tasha can be just as easygoing as the others from time to time. She is more feminine than her good friend Uniqua. In seasons 2-4, she has a more amiable personality. She tends to be grumpy if she is not the boss. Her catchphrase is \"Oh, for goodness sakes!\" Speaking voice: [[Naelee Rae]] (seasons 1\u20132) and Gianna Bruzzese (seasons 3\u20134). Singing voice: Kristin Danielle Klabunde (seasons 1\u20133) and Gabriella Malek (seasons 3\u20134). Dancer: Darlene Dirstine (seasons 1\u20133), Amanda Ulibarri (season 4), and Nancy Renee Braun (season 4).\n* Austin is a shy but fun-loving purple [[kangaroo]]. Though generally soft-spoken in Season 1, due to recently moving into the neighborhood, Austin starts to come out of his shell as the series progresses. He is revealed to be smart and imaginative. Austin rarely appears in the spotlight, but takes the role of the lead character in several episodes. His catchphrase varies from show to show. In more than one episode, he refers to himself as \"Just Austin.\" Says Bogush: \"Austin's usually the one pulling up the rear. He's kind of a get-along guy.\"<ref name=\"ref1\"/> Austin has been shown to occasionally display a more villainous side, such as in the episodes \"High Tea\" and \"The Magic Skateboard\". Speaking voice: [[Jonah Bobo]]. Singing voice: Thomas Sharkey (seasons 1\u20133) and Nicholas Barasch (season 4). Dancer: Kristen Frost.\n\n===Recurring===\n*Sherman \u2013 A small, orange-spotted yellow worm. Sherman is easily scared due to his small size. He appears in \"The Heart of the Jungle\", \"Polka Palace Party\", and \"Attack of the 50 Foot Worman\". His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Wormans \u2013 A fictional species of colorful, worm-like creatures who speak in squeaks and gibberish. They appear in all the seasons of the show.\n*Dragon \u2013 A friendly, green-colored dragon who appears three times (the movie \"Tale of the Mighty Knights\" and the episode \"The Tale of the Not-So-Nice Dragon\"). He hatched from a spotted egg and lives inside of Dragon Mountain. His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Aliens \u2013 Green-colored aliens with eyestalks appear four times: \"Mission to Mars\", \"News Flash\", \"Los Galacticos\", and \"The Big Dipper Diner\".\n*Giant clam \u2013 A hungry, irritable clam who appears in \"The Legend of the Volcano Sisters\" and \"The Great Dolphin Race\". It is very protective of its pearl. It pants and acts like a dog.\n*Voices \u2013 Voices were included in the episodes \"Secret Mission\" and \"It's Great To Be A Ghost!\" that do not come from any shown character.\n*Robot Roscoe \u2013 A robot owned by Austin who appears three times in the fourth season (the movie \"Robot Rampage\" and the episode \"Elephant on the Run\"). His voice is provided by Evan Mathew Weinstein.\n\n==Setting==\nThe characters live in houses adjoining a large backyard common to the three central houses (Uniqua's, Pablo's and Tyrone's) that is transformed by imagination into various adventure settings. Each house roughly corresponds to the color scheme of the character: Uniqua in a pink house, Pablo lives in a blue one, and Tyrone in an orange one. Tasha's house, which is to the left of the three central houses, is yellow and Austin's, to the right, is partially obscured by a fence but what is visible is purple. The fence, which surrounds the combined properties of the three main characters (Uniqua, Pablo and Tyrone), has a gate in it which leads to Austin's house. The curve of the cul-de-sac allows the play area to be roughly equal in distance from each house's back door.\n\nNot everything that appears in the imaginary world has a real-world counterpart. Often [[tree]]s, [[boulder]]s, brickwork, or similar objects appear where nothing originally existed. By the same token, even large trees in the real garden disappear completely when the imagination part of the story commences.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n{{:List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n\n==Production==\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot titled \"Me and My Friends,\" produced at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in September 1998.<ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/GalleryMotionPictures/MOTIONPICTURESGALLERY.htm| title=Me and My Friends Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios| publisher=Yvette Helin Studio| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot, Rick Lyon with Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html| title=Me and My Friends Pilot, Rick Lyon Puppeteer| publisher=Rick Lyon| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was rejected by Nickelodeon, and the concept was reworked into an animated short in 2002.<ref name=\"Backyardigans, 2002\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.tmfile.com/mark/?q=7814102| title=Backyardigans, 2002| publisher=TMFile| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was greenlit by Nickelodeon to become a full-length series.

{"title_page": "Effects of global warming on South Asia", "text_new": "{{update|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe '''effects of global warming on South Asia''' include steady [[sea level rise]], increased cyclonic activity, and changes in ambient temperature and precipitation patterns. Increased landslides and flooding are projected to have an impact upon states such as [[Assam]]. Ongoing sea level rises have already submerged several low-lying islands in the [[Sundarbans]], displacing sex of people. The first among the countries to be affected by severe climate change is [[Bangladesh]]. Its sea level, temperature and evaporation are increasing, and the changes in precipitation and cross boundary river flows are already beginning to cause drainage congestion. There is a reduction in fresh water availability, disturbance of morphological processes and a higher intensity of flooding. Regarding local temperature rises, the [[IPCC]] figure projected for the mean annual increase in temperature by the end of the century in South Asia is 3.3&nbsp;\u00b0C with the min-max range as 2.7 \u2013 4.7&nbsp;\u00b0C. The mean value for [[Tibet]] would be higher with mean increase of 3.8&nbsp;\u00b0C and min-max figures of 2.6 and 6.1&nbsp;\u00b0C respectively which implies harsher warming conditions for the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] watersheds. [[India]]'s [[GDP]] could decline by up to 9%, due to shifting growing seasons for major crops such as [[rice]], production of which could fall by 40%. Around seven million people are projected to be displaced due to, among other factors, submersion of parts of [[Mumbai]] and [[Chennai]], if global temperatures were to rise by a mere 2&nbsp;\u00b0C (3.6&nbsp;\u00b0F)\n\n==Temperature==\nAs per the [[IPCC]], depending upon the scenario visualised, the projected global average surface warming will result in temperature increases worldwide at the end of the 21st Century relative to the end of the 20th Century ranges from 0.6 to 4&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\"IPCC AR4 \u2013 WG1 \u2013 SPM\">IPCC, 2007: Summary for Policymakers.

The high temperatures are expected to impact 23 states in 2019, up from nine in 2015 and 19 in 2018. The number of heat wave days has increased \u2014 not just day temperature, night temperatures increased also. 2018 was the country's sixth hottest year on record, and 11 of its 15 warmest years have occurred since 2004. The capital of New Delhi broke its all-time record with a high of 48 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"Science as well as our subjective experiences has made it unequivocally clear that longer, hotter and deadlier summers are poised to become the norm due to climate change,\" environmental researcher Hem Dholakia wrote\"\n\nToday, because of global warming, the world is one degree Celsius warmer than it was before the industrial revolution. According to author Wallace-Wells, if the temperature rises even one more degree, \u201cCities now home to millions, across India and the Middle East, would become so hot that stepping outside in summer would be a lethal risk.\u201d In India, exposure to heat waves is said to increase by 8 times between 2021 and 2050, and by 300% by the end of this century. (See article: \u201cHeat wave exposure in India in current, 1.5 \u00b0C, and 2.0 \u00b0C worlds,\u201d in the journal ''Environmental Research Letters)''. The number of Indians exposed to heat waves increased by 200% from 2010 to 2016. Heat waves also affect farm labour productivity. The heat waves affect central and northwestern India the most, and the eastern coast and Telangana have also been affected. In 2015, the latter places witnessed at least 2500 deaths. For the first time in history, Kerala reported a heat wave in 2016. The government is being advised by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in predicting and mitigating heat waves.

More than 2,000 people died in 2015, 375 in 2017 and 20 in 2018. \"Officials say this is because the government has made an effort to reduce the death toll by encouraging residents to reduce or alter the time spent working on hot days and by providing free drinking water to hard-hit populations\". It also used water to cool streets and forced police to guard water tankers in Madhya Pradesh state after fights over supply turned deadly. Those measures cost a lot of money and water, and the government's resources was limited this year by the country's national election.

Incentives can be provided for electric vehicles or public transport and this curb the impact of the transportation sector. However, though these suggestions have been made, there is no political will to carry them out. Households can be given electricity and slowly phasing out LPG (the current trend is to increase the usage of the latter). Rainwater can be harvested and the rivers could be restored to their original flow so that they can bring back the wetlands and the natural ways of silt, nutrient and wildlife flow. All of these use technologies and can be implemented by the 11-year period the IPCC has stipulated before which any change must be made if we are to evade the adverse effects of climate change. So far, though the initiatives by the Delhi Metro to switch to solar power- or similar efforts by the Kochi airport-are a step in the right direction, such moves are few and far between. These models should be taken up by other agents as well.<ref name=\"Alexander\"/>\n\nThe latest accord, the 2015 Paris Agreement, takes a different approach.

In 2019, the temperature reached 50.6 degrees Celsius, 36 people were killed. 15 monkeys died from heat stroke after another group of monkeys prevented them from accessing the closest water source. The high temperatures are expected to impact 23 states in 2019, up from nine in 2015 and 19 in 2018. The number of heat wave days has increased \u2014 not just day temperature, night temperatures increased also. 2018 was the country's sixth hottest year on record, and 11 of its 15 warmest years have occurred since 2004. The capital of New Delhi broke its all-time record with a high of 48 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"Science as well as our subjective experiences has made it unequivocally clear that longer, hotter and deadlier summers are poised to become the norm due to climate change,\" environmental researcher Hem Dholakia wrote\"\n\nToday, because of global warming, the world is one degree Celsius warmer than it was before the industrial revolution. According to author Wallace-Wells, if the temperature rises even one more degree, \u201cCities now home to millions, across India and the Middle East, would become so hot that stepping outside in summer would be a lethal risk.\u201d In India, exposure to heat waves is said to increase by 8 times between 2021 and 2050, and by 300% by the end of this century. (See article: \u201cHeat wave exposure in India in current, 1.5 \u00b0C, and 2.0 \u00b0C worlds,\u201d in the journal ''Environmental Research Letters)''. The number of Indians exposed to heat waves increased by 200% from 2010 to 2016. Heat waves also affect farm labour productivity. The heat waves affect central and northwestern India the most, and the eastern coast and Telangana have also been affected. In 2015, the latter places witnessed at least 2500 deaths. For the first time in history, Kerala reported a heat wave in 2016. The government is being advised by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in predicting and mitigating heat waves.

More than 2,000 people died in 2015, 375 in 2017 and 20 in 2018. \"Officials say this is because the government has made an effort to reduce the death toll by encouraging residents to reduce or alter the time spent working on hot days and by providing free drinking water to hard-hit populations\". It also used water to cool streets and forced police to guard water tankers in Madhya Pradesh state after fights over supply turned deadly.

Incentives can be provided for electric vehicles or public transport and this curb the impact of the transportation sector. However, though these suggestions have been made, there is no political will to carry them out. Households can be given electricity and slowly phasing out LPG (the current trend is to increase the usage of the latter). Rainwater can be harvested and the rivers could be restored to their original flow so that they can bring back the wetlands and the natural ways of silt, nutrient and wildlife flow. All of these use technologies and can be implemented by the 11-year period the IPCC has stipulated before which any change must be made if we are to evade the adverse effects of climate change. So far, though the initiatives by the Delhi Metro to switch to solar power- or similar efforts by the Kochi airport-are a step in the right direction, such moves are few and far between.

It is located in Cumberland's [[Washington Street Historic District (Cumberland, Maryland)|Washington Street Historic District]]. Although many church spires dot the Cumberland landscape, it is the Allegany County Courthouse that dominates this city's skyline. The building is prominently sited along Washington Street, which rises sharply from [[Wills Creek (North Branch Potomac River)|Wills Creek]] running through the heart of Cumberland. Historically, courthouses in America have been one of the most architecturally impressive buildings within a community. In this way, the architecture of the building was able to convey the authority of a local government, as well as instill respect and recognition.\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1789, the Allegany County Court was created by Act of the [[Maryland General Assembly]]. As part of the Act, [[Washington County, Maryland|Washington County]] had been subdivided and Allegany County, a name derived from the Indian word \"Oolikhanna,\" meaning beautiful stream, was formed. Local historians have reported that the first court cases in Allegany County were held in the home of John Graham and court business was held in a Green Street tavern owned by Abraham Faw. This was a temporary measure until a proper courthouse could be built.\n\n=== First Court House===\nIn 1793, the General Assembly authorized the construction of the county's first courthouse and jail, but it was not until 1799 that the courthouse was ready for use.  This first courthouse was built for a sum of $3,062.50.\n\nIn 1806, improvements were made by building records rooms for the [[Clerk of Court]] and the Registrar of Wills for a total sum of $1200.00.\n\n===Second Court House===\nIn 1834, the courthouse had become too small for the county's increasing needs and a new courthouse was approved to be built for a sum of $5000.00.  This new courthouse was completed in 1841.\n\nThirty years later, in the 1860s, $75,000 in bonds were issued by the County Commissioners for the purpose of enlarging and remodeling the existing courthouse and for building a new jail.  The courthouse was improved and used for the next 30 years, until it caught fire and was destroyed on January 5, 1893.  Only the vaults of the [[Clerk of Court]] and Registrar of Wills were salvaged from the fire. The court has moved to the [[Academy of Music (Cumberland)|City Hall and Academy of Music]] building temporarily.\n\n===Third Court House===\n\nDesigned in 1893, the Courthouse was the first major commission of local architect [[Wright Butler]]. Butler based his design for this public building on the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] architectural style. The massing and detail of the courthouse are typical of this late 19th-century style, developed from the works of architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]]. Characteristic of this style, the courthouse combines the use of brick highlighted with stone belt courses and presents a uniform rock-faced exterior finish. The building's ribbons of windows set deeply into the walls, and large arched entry are also typical Richardsonian features. Less typical is the courthouse's tower [[buttress]]ed with round columns that rises above the three-story building. Construction of the building was completed for a total cost of $97,000.

It is located in Cumberland's [[Washington Street Historic District (Cumberland, Maryland)|Washington Street Historic District]]. Although many church spires dot the Cumberland landscape, it is the Allegany County Courthouse that dominates this city's skyline. The building is prominently sited along Washington Street, which rises sharply from [[Wills Creek (North Branch Potomac River)|Wills Creek]] running through the heart of Cumberland. Historically, courthouses in America have been one of the most architecturally impressive buildings within a community. In this way, the architecture of the building was able to convey the authority of a local government, as well as instill respect and recognition.\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1789, the Allegany County Court was created by Act of the [[Maryland General Assembly]]. As part of the Act, [[Washington County, Maryland|Washington County]] had been subdivided and Allegany County, a name derived from the Indian word \"Oolikhanna,\" meaning beautiful stream, was formed. Local historians have reported that the first court cases in Allegany County were held in the home of John Graham and court business was held in a Green Street tavern owned by Abraham Faw. This was a temporary measure until a proper courthouse could be built.\n\n=== First Court House===\nIn 1793, the General Assembly authorized the construction of the county's first courthouse and jail, but it was not until 1799 that the courthouse was ready for use.  This first courthouse was built for a sum of $3,062.50.\n\nIn 1806, improvements were made by building records rooms for the [[Clerk of Court]] and the Registrar of Wills for a total sum of $1200.00.\n\n===Second Court House===\nIn 1834, the courthouse had become too small for the county's increasing needs and a new courthouse was approved to be built for a sum of $5000.00.  This new courthouse was completed in 1841. \n\nThirty years later, in the 1860s, $75,000 in bonds were issued by the County Commissioners for the purpose of enlarging and remodeling the existing courthouse and for building a new jail.  The courthouse was improved and used for the next 30 years, until it caught fire and was destroyed on January 5, 1893.  Only the vaults of the [[Clerk of Court]] and Registrar of Wills were salvaged from the fire. The court has moved to the [[Academy of Music (Cumberland)|City Hall and Academy of Music]] building temporarily.\n\n===Third Court House===\n\nDesigned in 1893, the Courthouse was the first major commission of local architect [[Wright Butler]]. Butler based his design for this public building on the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] architectural style. The massing and detail of the courthouse are typical of this late 19th-century style, developed from the works of architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]]. Characteristic of this style, the courthouse combines the use of brick highlighted with stone belt courses and presents a uniform rock-faced exterior finish. The building's ribbons of windows set deeply into the walls, and large arched entry are also typical Richardsonian features. Less typical is the courthouse's tower [[buttress]]ed with round columns that rises above the three-story building. Construction of the building was completed for a total cost of $97,000.  One of the pinnacle examples of Richardson's work is the [[Allegheny County Courthouse]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], which Cumberland's Courthouse strongly resembles. \n\n==References==\n\n* Will H.

Oliveri is perhaps best known as a former member of [[Kyuss]] and later [[Queens of the Stone Age]] from 1998 to 2004. Oliveri is also a solo artist and frequent contributor to his friends' albums and tours, including [[Winnebago Deal]], [[Mark Lanegan|Mark Lanegan Band]], [[Masters of Reality]], [[Turbonegro]] and [[Moistboyz]], among many others. Oliveri is currently the frontman of his project, [[Mondo Generator]], a [[punk (music)|punk]] and [[metal (music)|metal]] hybrid that he formed in 1997.<ref name=\"Nick Oliveri\">[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nick-oliveri-mn0000398373#wre \"Nick Oliveri\"]. allmusic.com.

In early 1989, shortly after Oliveri's  departure, the band changed its name to [[Sons of Kyuss EP|Sons of Kyuss]], and after self-releasing an EP in 1990, the band re-recruited Oliveri on bass to replace Cockrell, and shortened their name to [[Kyuss]].\n\nOliveri left the band following completion of ''[[Blues for the Red Sun]]'' and was replaced by [[Scott Reeder (bassist)|Scott Reeder]], who had been approached about joining Kyuss five to six months earlier during a West Coast tour with [[The Obsessed]]. Following his departure from Kyuss, Oliveri joined the [[Dwarves (band)|Dwarves]] as an on again off again bassist under the moniker Rex Everything.\n\n=== Mondo Generator ===\nNick Oliveri (under the moniker ''Rex Everything'') formed Mondo Generator in 1997 and with friends [[Josh Homme]], [[Brant Bjork]], [[Rob Oswald]], Karl Doyle and others, recorded the debut album, ''[[Cocaine Rodeo]]''. The [[album]] wouldn't be released until three years later due to Oliveri and Homme being full-time members of [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. The album was released by cult-favorite [[Southern Lord|Southern Lord Records]] in 2000. There was little support of the album by the way of live shows, and the band gained cult status among the most devoted Queens of the Stone Age fans.\n\nAs of April 2007, Mondo Generator was scheduled to appear on the 12th annual [[Ozzfest]] tour (otherwise known as the \"FreeFest\" tour), but officially dropped off the tour on July 26, 2007 after appearing at four Ozzfest dates. Oliveri stated, \"We can't keep on touring for free! My band's not free, it's costing me.\"{{citequote|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Queens of the Stone Age ===\n[[File:Nick Oliveri V Festival 2003.jpg|thumb|Oliveri performing with [[Queens of the Stone Age]] at the [[V festival#V2003|2003 V Festival]]]]\nOliveri was a core contributor to Queens of the Stone Age from 1998 to 2004, playing bass and providing backup and lead vocals on two of the band's biggest albums, ''[[Rated R (Queens of the Stone Age album)|Rated R]]''  and ''[[Songs for the Deaf]],'' in addition to co-writing most of the album's songs with bandmate Josh Homme. He first appeared on the band's [[Queens of the Stone Age (album)|self titled debut album]] in the form of a voicemail confirming his commitment to the band on the album's final song, \"I Was a Teenage Hand Model\".\n\nOliveri's lead singing can be heard on songs such as \"Auto Pilot\", \"Tension Head\" and \"Quick and to the Pointless\" from ''Rated R'' and \"Another Love Song\", \"Gonna Leave You\", \"Six Shooter\" and \"You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar but I Feel Like a Millionaire,\" from ''Songs for the Deaf.''\n\nIn January 2004, following a string of dates touring in Australia, Oliveri was fired from the band, with reasoning at first being aggressive treatment of the band's fans, later being accusations of possible abuse to his girlfriend. Oliveri has said to have come to the conclusion himself that during a sound check at a show in Spain in 2003 he acted too aggressively to Josh Homme over his relationship with then-girlfriend [[Brody Dalle]] after getting too drunk on wine, raising tension between the two.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51dsoWRjOT8|title=Nick Oliveri Quits Kyuss Lives|work=YouTube|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-Queens of the Stone Age ===\nSince his firing from Queens of the Stone Age, Oliveri has recorded an acoustic LP entitled ''[[Demolition Day]]'' that was eventually released as a second disk in a limited edition of [[Mondo Generator]]'s latest album, ''[[Dead Planet: SonicSlowMotionTrails]]''. Although now concentrating on the Mondo Generator project, in September 2006 Oliveri stated \"I feel that Queens is something I can contribute to and [[Josh Homme]] needs me to do it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/37152-nick-oliveri-mondo-uncontrollable|title=The Skinny \u2013 Nick Oliveri \u2013 Mondo Uncontrollable|date=October 13, 2006|publisher=Theskinny.co.uk|accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref>\n\nThere was speculation that he would return in Queens of the Stone Age during their summer tour due to Josh Homme's dedication of \"New Fang\" to Nick for \"new beginnings\". However, this proved to be false. In March 2011, Oliveri stated: \"The last time I saw them play was a benefit for [[Brian O'Connor (bassist)|Brian O'Connor]] in L.A., from the [[Eagles of Death Metal]]. I was down there and I mentioned to them, \"Why don't I come up and do \"Millionaire\" or something, and sing it and not play bass?\" [Josh] was like, \"Nah, I don't think that's a good idea yet.\" It's kind of in his court for stuff like that. I don't think he wants to give anybody the wrong idea. I don't necessarily know if that would happen. And he's got a good band\u2014he's taking the band in the direction he wants it to go.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/music/kyuss-lives-q-a|title=Nick Oliveri Interview|last=Prato|first=Greg|date=March 23, 2011|publisher=UGO.com|accessdate=2011-07-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325180734/http://www.ugo.com/music/kyuss-lives-q-a|archivedate=March 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn late November 2012 Oliveri contributed vocals on the track \"If I Had a Tail\" for his former band Queens of the Stone Age on their album ''[[\u2026Like Clockwork]]''. Upon hearing fellow former Queens member [[Dave Grohl]] would make a return to drums on the album, Oliveri inquired to Josh Homme if he could play bass: \"I actually put in a request with Josh. I heard Dave was playing on the record, and I was like, 'Dude! I wanna play bass on it!' I'd be a fool not to ask. If Dave Grohl was playing drums, then I want in. He's an amazing drummer.

Oliveri is also a solo artist and frequent contributor to his friends' albums and tours, including [[Winnebago Deal]], [[Mark Lanegan|Mark Lanegan Band]], [[Masters of Reality]], [[Turbonegro]] and [[Moistboyz]], among many others. Oliveri is currently the frontman of his project, [[Mondo Generator]], a [[punk (music)|punk]] and [[metal (music)|metal]] hybrid that he formed in 1997.<ref name=\"Nick Oliveri\">[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nick-oliveri-mn0000398373#wre \"Nick Oliveri\"]. allmusic.com.

In early 1989, shortly after Oliveri's  departure, the band changed its name to [[Sons of Kyuss EP|Sons of Kyuss]], and after self-releasing an EP in 1990, the band re-recruited Oliveri on bass to replace Cockrell, and shortened their name to [[Kyuss]].\n\nOliveri left the band following completion of ''[[Blues for the Red Sun]]'' and was replaced by [[Scott Reeder (bassist)|Scott Reeder]], who had been approached about joining Kyuss five to six months earlier during a West Coast tour with [[The Obsessed]]. Following his departure from Kyuss, Oliveri joined the [[Dwarves (band)|Dwarves]] as an on again off again bassist under the moniker Rex Everything.\n\n=== Mondo Generator ===\nNick Oliveri (under the moniker ''Rex Everything'') formed Mondo Generator in 1997 and with friends [[Josh Homme]], [[Brant Bjork]], [[Rob Oswald]], Karl Doyle and others, recorded the debut album, ''[[Cocaine Rodeo]]''. The [[album]] wouldn't be released until three years later due to Oliveri and Homme being full-time members of [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. The album was released by cult-favorite [[Southern Lord|Southern Lord Records]] in 2000. There was little support of the album by the way of live shows, and the band gained cult status among the most devoted Queens of the Stone Age fans.\n\nAs of April 2007, Mondo Generator was scheduled to appear on the 12th annual [[Ozzfest]] tour (otherwise known as the \"FreeFest\" tour), but officially dropped off the tour on July 26, 2007 after appearing at four Ozzfest dates. Oliveri stated, \"We can't keep on touring for free! My band's not free, it's costing me.\"{{citequote|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Queens of the Stone Age ===\n[[File:Nick Oliveri V Festival 2003.jpg|thumb|Oliveri performing with [[Queens of the Stone Age]] at the [[V festival#V2003|2003 V Festival]]]]\nOliveri was a core contributor to Queens of the Stone Age from 1998 to 2004, playing bass and providing backup and lead vocals on two of the band's biggest albums, ''[[Rated R (Queens of the Stone Age album)|Rated R]]''  and ''[[Songs for the Deaf]],'' in addition to co-writing most of the album's songs with bandmate Josh Homme. He first appeared on the band's [[Queens of the Stone Age (album)|self titled debut album]] in the form of a voicemail confirming his commitment to the band on the album's final song, \"I Was a Teenage Hand Model\".\n\nOliveri's lead singing can be heard on songs such as \"Auto Pilot\", \"Tension Head\" and \"Quick and to the Pointless\" from ''Rated R'' and \"Another Love Song\", \"Gonna Leave You\", \"Six Shooter\" and \"You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar but I Feel Like a Millionaire,\" from ''Songs for the Deaf.''\n\nIn January 2004, following a string of dates touring in Australia, Oliveri was fired from the band, with reasoning at first being aggressive treatment of the band's fans, later being accusations of possible abuse to his girlfriend. Oliveri has said to have come to the conclusion himself that during a sound check at a show in Spain in 2003 he acted too aggressively to Josh Homme over his relationship with then-girlfriend [[Brody Dalle]] after getting too drunk on wine, raising tension between the two.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51dsoWRjOT8|title=Nick Oliveri Quits Kyuss Lives|work=YouTube|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-Queens of the Stone Age ===\nSince his firing from Queens of the Stone Age, Oliveri has recorded an acoustic LP entitled ''[[Demolition Day]]'' that was eventually released as a second disk in a limited edition of [[Mondo Generator]]'s latest album, ''[[Dead Planet: SonicSlowMotionTrails]]''. Although now concentrating on the Mondo Generator project, in September 2006 Oliveri stated \"I feel that Queens is something I can contribute to and [[Josh Homme]] needs me to do it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/37152-nick-oliveri-mondo-uncontrollable|title=The Skinny \u2013 Nick Oliveri \u2013 Mondo Uncontrollable|date=October 13, 2006|publisher=Theskinny.co.uk|accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref>\n\nThere was speculation that he would return in Queens of the Stone Age during their summer tour due to Josh Homme's dedication of \"New Fang\" to Nick for \"new beginnings\". However, this proved to be false. In March 2011, Oliveri stated: \"The last time I saw them play was a benefit for [[Brian O'Connor (bassist)|Brian O'Connor]] in L.A., from the [[Eagles of Death Metal]]. I was down there and I mentioned to them, \"Why don't I come up and do \"Millionaire\" or something, and sing it and not play bass?\" [Josh] was like, \"Nah, I don't think that's a good idea yet.\" It's kind of in his court for stuff like that. I don't think he wants to give anybody the wrong idea. I don't necessarily know if that would happen. And he's got a good band\u2014he's taking the band in the direction he wants it to go.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/music/kyuss-lives-q-a|title=Nick Oliveri Interview|last=Prato|first=Greg|date=March 23, 2011|publisher=UGO.com|accessdate=2011-07-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325180734/http://www.ugo.com/music/kyuss-lives-q-a|archivedate=March 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn late November 2012 Oliveri contributed vocals on the track \"If I Had a Tail\" for his former band Queens of the Stone Age on their album ''[[\u2026Like Clockwork]]''. Upon hearing fellow former Queens member [[Dave Grohl]] would make a return to drums on the album, Oliveri inquired to Josh Homme if he could play bass: \"I actually put in a request with Josh. I heard Dave was playing on the record, and I was like, 'Dude! I wanna play bass on it!' I'd be a fool not to ask. If Dave Grohl was playing drums, then I want in. He's an amazing drummer.

{"title_page": "List of Blue's Clues characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Blue's Clues'' characters}}\n''[[Blue's Clues]]'' is an American children's television series airing on the [[Nickelodeon]] family of channels. The series takes place inside a [[picture book]] world in which everything is made of paper cutouts, clay, and other craft materials. It is presented by a live-action human host who lives in a yellow house inhabited by anthropomorphic everyday objects.\n\n[[Steve Burns]] hosted the series from its debut in 1996 until 2002, when the part was taken over by [[Donovan Patton]]. The program features an [[ensemble cast]] of animated characters who interact with the host. Co-creator [[Traci Paige Johnson]] voices the title character, a dog named Blue who communicates through distinctive barks. The series' composers [[Michael Rubin]] and Nick Balaban voice Mailbox and Mr. Salt, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the main characters, the show included various newly-introduced [[recurring character]]s and [[guest star]]s throughout its run. Some of the actors including Steve Burns and Josh Dela Cruz play fictional versions of themselves. In other words, some guests appeared as live-action companions of the host, while others voiced an animated cameo role. When a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series titled ''[[Blue's Room]]'' premiered in 2004, a group of puppet characters were introduced as new friends of Blue.\n\n==Main characters==\n\n===Blue===\nBlue is a playful and energetic 5-year-old<ref>http://www.nickjr.com/blues-clues/</ref> female<!-- Sources clearly show her to be female.--><ref name=nickjrabout>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121219012742/http://www.nickjr.com/blues-clues/about-blues-clues/blues-clues-characters.html meet the characters on blue's clues].

She cannot talk but communicates with her owners, Steve, Joe, and Josh, through barks that they interpret based on her tone and expression. In each episode, she plays a game called Blue's Clues, in which she leaves three blue paw print clues for the host and viewers to find in order to answer a question. She has the ability to enter storybooks and picture frames by \"skidooing\" into them with a special dance routine. In the sixth season, she is granted a magic playroom called [[Blue's Room]] in which she can interact with the viewer and a cast of live-action puppet characters. She is voiced by [[Traci Paige Johnson]], one of the series' creators. Johnson was cast as the character's voice because out of the crew, she was able to sound the most like a dog.<ref name=\"tenyears-1\"/>\n\n===Steve===\n[[Steve Burns]] plays a fictitious version of himself and is the host for the show's first four seasons. He is Blue's owner and caregiver. He wears a distinctive green-striped long-sleeve polo shirt with khakis and brown shoes. He loves anything that has a similar pattern. He\u2019s intelligent, energetic, friendly, clever, helpful and sympathetic but sometimes clumsy, wild, impulsive, and forgetful. Steve and Blue are best friends. He\u2019s always excited and prepared to play Blue's Clues, but can almost never find clues himself and relies on the viewer to help locate them. Whenever he finds a clue, he draws it in a pocket-sized pad of paper called the Handy Dandy Notebook. When he finishes a game of Blue's Clues, he sits in a giant red armchair called the Thinking Chair and comes up with possible solutions to Blue's puzzles. Within the first two seasons (some in the second), he would give out wrong and silly answers which usually upsets Blue, even in \"Blue's Big Musical\", \"Blue's Big Costume Party\", and \"Blocks\". His favorite time of the day is mail time when he receives a letter from Mailbox. He owns a stuffed [[anteater]] named Horace, which indicates that anteaters are also his favorite animal. At the end of the fourth season, Steve leaves for college on a [[hopscotch]] scholarship and leaves his younger brother, Joe, to take care of his house and Blue. There, he becomes the varsity captain for the hopscotch team at his college as revealed in the 100th episode special. In the reboot series ''[[Blue's Clues & You!]]'', Steve has since graduated and now runs the Blueprints Detective Agency and appears as a recurring character.\n\n===Joe===\nJoe is the replacement host for the show's last two seasons. He is Steve's younger, taller brother who stays at the Blue's Clues house after Steve leaves for college.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Blue's Clues: Steve Goes to College (3) - TV.com | publisher = TV.com | date = 2002-04-29 | url = http://www.tv.com/blues-clues/steve-goes-to-college-3/episode/160896/summary.html | accessdate = 2011-08-01}}</ref> He wears a variety of different colored shirts with a horizontal line of [[square]]s on the front. In each of Joe's episodes, he alternates between colors (red, yellow, green, orange, purple, and blue). His favorite toy is a stuffed duck named Boris. He owns a Handy Dandy Notebook similar to Steve's, but it is larger and shaped like the Thinking Chair. In later episodes of Season 5 & 6, Joe normally does not draw clues in his notebook and instead watches magically-animated versions of the clues appear. Although sometimes silly and younger than Steve, he seems to be more mature and straight-talking as he never gave out wrong answers during thinking time thanks to Steve's advice. In the reboot series ''[[Blue's Clues & You!]]'', Joe now runs the Present Store and appears as a recurring character. He is played by [[Donovan Patton]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Lipton | first = Michael | title = Am I Blue?

He is Steve and Joe's younger cousin. He is a talented singer. Josh's double-sided Handy Dandy Notebook has a phone on the other side, which he uses to communicate with the other characters.\n\n===Mailbox===\nMailbox is a cheerful purple [[Letter box|mailbox]] who lives at the foot of the pathway in front of the Blue's Clues house. In each episode, Mailbox delivers a letter or informing an incoming e-mail after the host sings a special song called \"Mailtime\" and sits on the Thinking Chair. His letters contain video messages from children around the world that relate to the episode's topic. Mailbox has a thick [[New York accent#Social and geographic variation|Brooklyn accent]] and likes to crack jokes. He wants to be a comedian when he grows up and has a collection of postage stamps. Although he is normally stationed on a stake in the ground, he can use an \"extendo\" arm to move anywhere around the house or the backyard. He is voiced by [[Michael Rubin (composer)|Michael Rubin]], who is normally credited under the stage name Seth O'Hickory.<ref name=\"tracy-52\" />\n\n===Sidetable Drawer===\nSidetable Drawer is the keeper of the Handy Dandy Notebook. She lives in the living room to the left of the Thinking Chair. Whenever Steve or Joe starts a game of Blue's Clues, they must go to Sidetable and ask her for their notebook. She usually has Steve's telephone on top of her and holds an assortment of useful items in her drawer, depending on the situation. She is a talented singer and enjoys performing on stage. However, she is shy and sometimes lets her lack of confidence prevent her from singing in front of others. She has been known to be sad whenever someone doesn't say \"please\", as proven in the episode \"Blue's Sad Day\". Sidetable likes all kinds of music. Unlike the other characters, Sidetable has an inanimate form without a face that is seen whenever she is not speaking. In the reboot series, her tabletop is square and gains a wooden texture. She is voiced by Aleisha LaNa\u00e9 Allen.\n\n===The Spice Family===\nThe Spice Family are a group of six condiment dispensers who live in the kitchen, each named after the type of spice they contain.\n*Mr. Salt is a salt shaker of French heritage who acts as the homemaker of the Blue's Clues house. He takes care of the other residents and prepares food for them. He and his wife Mrs. Pepper come from Paris, where they worked as cooks. Despite his experience as a chef, Mr. Salt is prone to accidents in the kitchen and often needs the host's help when he is baking. He is voiced by Nick Balaban, one of the show's music composers.<ref name=\"tenyears-1\" />\n*Mrs. Pepper is the mother figure of the Blue's Clues house. She spends much of her time caring for Paprika and Cinnamon. In her free time, she likes to sing with Mr. Salt and swim in the kitchen sink. She is commonly shown holding Cinnamon in her arms while Mr. Salt holds Paprika. She was voiced by Penelope Jewkes during the first season and by [[Spencer Kayden]] for the remainder of the series.\n*Paprika is Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper's daughter. She first appears in \"Blue's News\". In the first three seasons, she is a baby and only speaks in incomplete sentences. She has an orange [[gummi candy|gummy]] teddy bear and sleeps in a crib made from a peanut. In the fourth season, Paprika becomes a toddler and prepares to be a responsible sibling after the announcement of Mrs. Pepper's second child. Paprika is voiced by Jenna Marie Castle as a baby and by Corrine Hoffman as a toddler.\n*Cinnamon is Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper's newborn son, who is introduced over a five-episode story arc during the fourth season. He is the newest and youngest resident of the Blue's Clues house. He has several [[hand-me-down]] playthings from Paprika and a purple rattle, which is his favorite toy. When Paprika helps teach him how to do things, she learns more about herself and her role as his older sister. Cinnamon is voiced by Nick Balaban's daughter, Annalivia Balaban.\n*Sage and Ginger are Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper's newborn fraternal twins, who debut in ''Blue's Clues & You!''. They first appear in \"Big News With Blue\". They are both short bottles with faces, arms, and cork caps. Sage is a boy whose bottle is colored green and Ginger is a girl whose bottle is colored light brown.\n\n===Shovel and Pail===\nShovel and Pail are a 6-year-old<ref>http://www.nickjr.com/blues-clues/</ref> brother and sister, respectively, who live in the garden of the Blue's Clues house. They first appear in \"Blue's Story Time\". They accompany Steve or Joe whenever a game of Blue's Clues leads them outside to the backyard. Their favorite activity is building sand castles together in the sand table. They love learning about the different types of animals that live outside. They both dream of becoming [[veterinarian]]s when they grow up. Their color schemes parallel each other's; Shovel is yellow with a red mouth, while Pail is red with a yellow mouth. Shovel was voiced by Stephen Schmidt from 1996-2001 and by Jonathan Press from 2001-2004. Pail was voiced by Marshall Claffy from 1996-2001, by Julia Wetherell from 2001-2003, and by Nicole Gibson in 2004.\n\n===Tickety Tock===\nTickety Tock, known as Tickety for short, is a 5-year-old<ref>http://www.nickjr.com/blues-clues/</ref> [[alarm clock]] who lives on a nightstand in the bedroom of the Blue's Clues house. The '12' mark on her face is usually replaced by a symbol that relates to the episode's topic. She loves counting different things and often invites the host and the viewers to help her with basic math. Tickety is very number-oriented and likes to keep schedules. She is responsible for waking the residents of the Blue's Clues house every morning by ringing her bells. She is best friends with Slippery. Tickety was voiced by Kathryn Avery from 1996-2001 and by Kelly Nigh from 2001-2004.\n\n===Slippery Soap===\nSlippery Soap, known as Slippery for short, is a 5-year-old<ref>http://www.nickjr.com/blues-clues/</ref> lavender-colored bar of [[soap]] who lives in the bathroom of the Blue's Clues house. He often has trouble standing upright and is known for shouting his catchphrase \"Whoa!\" whenever he slides around. He first appears in \"What Does Blue Need\". He is always surrounded by a trail of bubbles. He dreams of becoming the captain of a boat when he grows up and likes to wear a blue sailor cap with an anchor emblem on it. He is best friends with Tickety. He was voiced by Cody Ross Pitts from 1996-2001, Patrick Van Wagnen from 2001-2003, and Sean Hanley in 2004.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n\n===Magenta===\nMagenta is Blue's best friend, who is the same age<ref>http://www.nickjr.com/blues-clues/</ref> as and identical to her with the exception of a magenta fur coat. She<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THE PRONOUN TO MALE. IN THE SOURCE BELOW, BURNS STATES HER TO BE FEMALE.--> is first shown in the episode \"Blue's Story Time\" but is not properly introduced until \"Magenta Comes Over\". She is one of Blue's classmates at school and has visited the Blue's Clues house on special occasions. Magenta is shyer than Blue but shares the same playful and energetic attitude. Steve Burns stated in an interview that both she and Blue are girls.<ref name=\"huffpost\" /> She is voiced by Koyalee Chanda.\n\n===Periwinkle===\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT STATE THAT PERIWINKLE IS A GIRL; HE IS A BOY IN THE US. However, since he is a girl in the UK, the show did not originate in the UK. Also, do not change or remove age.-->\nPeriwinkle is a precocious 5-year-old<ref>http://www.nickjr.com/blues-clues/</ref> kitten from the city.<ref name=nickjrabout/> In \"Blue's Big Mystery\", he makes his debut.

He was voiced by Cameron Bowen from 2000-2001, by Kenny Kim from 2001-2003, and by Jansen Panettiere in 2004.\n\n===Felt Friends===\nThe Felt Friends are a group of children made entirely of geometric [[felt]] shapes. They live in a world that Blue and the host can enter by \"skidooing\" into a picture frame in the Blue's Clues house. They often ask for the host's help when they need to count, build, or fix something constructed with felt shapes. Many of the Felt Friends' names start with the letter F.\n\n===Turquoise===\nTurquoise is Blue's pet turtle, who has a light blue shell with dark blue pentagonal shapes on it. She debuts in the season two episode \"Blue's Birthday\" when Steve gives her to Blue as a special birthday present. Turquoise appears sporadically in episodes afterwards, normally in a small glass [[terrarium]] on the bedroom shelf.\n\n===Snail===\nThe snail is a pink garden snail who appears hidden in three scenes of every episode. His appearances are intended as [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]]s for viewers to look for. The snail is rarely addressed directly or acknowledged by the main characters. He makes a guest appearance during the final musical number in ''[[Blue's Big Musical Movie]]'', in which he sings while riding a skateboard and reveals himself to have a loud, deep voice. In the spin-off series ''Blue's Room'', the snail appears as a stuffed animal in the background. He is big.\n\n==Minor characters==\n*'''Baby Bear''' is a young female bear cub from the storybook \"[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]\".

The series takes place inside a [[picture book]] world in which everything is made of paper cutouts, clay, and other craft materials. It is presented by a live-action human host who lives in a yellow house inhabited by anthropomorphic everyday objects.\n\n[[Steve Burns]] hosted the series from its debut in 1996 until 2002, when the part was taken over by [[Donovan Patton]]. The program features an [[ensemble cast]] of animated characters who interact with the host. Co-creator [[Traci Paige Johnson]] voices the title character, a dog named Blue who communicates through distinctive barks. The series' composers [[Michael Rubin]] and Nick Balaban voice Mailbox and Mr. Salt, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the main characters, the show included various newly-introduced [[recurring character]]s and [[guest star]]s throughout its run. Some of the actors including Steve Burns and Josh Dela Cruz play fictional versions of themselves. In other words, some guests appeared as live-action companions of the host, while others voiced an animated cameo role. When a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series titled ''[[Blue's Room]]'' premiered in 2004, a group of puppet characters were introduced as new friends of Blue.\n\n==Main characters==\n\n===Blue===\nBlue is a playful and energetic 5-year-old<ref>http://www.nickjr.com/blues-clues/</ref> female<!-- Sources clearly show her to be female.--><ref name=nickjrabout>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121219012742/http://www.nickjr.com/blues-clues/about-blues-clues/blues-clues-characters.html meet the characters on blue's clues].

She cannot talk but communicates with her owners, Steve, Joe, and Josh, through barks that they interpret based on her tone and expression. In each episode, she plays a game called Blue's Clues, in which she leaves three blue paw print clues for the host and viewers to find in order to answer a question. She has the ability to enter storybooks and picture frames by \"skidooing\" into them with a special dance routine. In the sixth season, she is granted a magic playroom called [[Blue's Room]] in which she can interact with the viewer and a cast of live-action puppet characters. She is voiced by [[Traci Paige Johnson]], one of the series' creators. Johnson was cast as the character's voice because out of the crew, she was able to sound the most like a dog.<ref name=\"tenyears-1\"/>\n\n===Steve===\n[[Steve Burns]] plays a fictitious version of himself and is the host for the show's first four seasons. He is Blue's owner and caregiver. He wears a distinctive green-striped long-sleeve polo shirt with khakis and brown shoes. He loves anything that has a similar pattern. He\u2019s intelligent, energetic, friendly, clever, helpful and sympathetic but sometimes clumsy, wild, impulsive, and forgetful. Steve and Blue are best friends. He\u2019s always excited and prepared to play Blue's Clues, but can almost never find clues himself and relies on the viewer to help locate them. Whenever he finds a clue, he draws it in a pocket-sized pad of paper called the Handy Dandy Notebook. When he finishes a game of Blue's Clues, he sits in a giant red armchair called the Thinking Chair and comes up with possible solutions to Blue's puzzles. Within the first two seasons (some in the second), he would give out wrong and silly answers which usually upsets Blue, even in \"Blue's Big Musical\", \"Blue's Big Costume Party\", and \"Blocks\". His favorite time of the day is mail time when he receives a letter from Mailbox. He owns a stuffed [[anteater]] named Horace, which indicates that anteaters are also his favorite animal. At the end of the fourth season, Steve leaves for college on a [[hopscotch]] scholarship and leaves his younger brother, Joe, to take care of his house and Blue. There, he becomes the varsity captain for the hopscotch team at his college as revealed in the 100th episode special. In the reboot series ''[[Blue's Clues & You!]]'', Steve has since graduated and now runs the Blueprints Detective Agency and appears as a recurring character.\n\n===Joe===\nJoe is the replacement host for the show's last two seasons. He is Steve's younger, taller brother who stays at the Blue's Clues house after Steve leaves for college.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Blue's Clues: Steve Goes to College (3) - TV.com | publisher = TV.com | date = 2002-04-29 | url = http://www.tv.com/blues-clues/steve-goes-to-college-3/episode/160896/summary.html | accessdate = 2011-08-01}}</ref> He wears a variety of different colored shirts with a horizontal line of [[square]]s on the front. In each of Joe's episodes, he alternates between colors (red, yellow, green, orange, purple, and blue). His favorite toy is a stuffed duck named Boris. He owns a Handy Dandy Notebook similar to Steve's, but it is larger and shaped like the Thinking Chair. In later episodes of Season 5 & 6, Joe normally does not draw clues in his notebook and instead watches magically-animated versions of the clues appear. Although sometimes silly and younger than Steve, he seems to be more mature and straight-talking as he never gave out wrong answers during thinking time thanks to Steve's advice. In the reboot series ''[[Blue's Clues & You!]]'', Joe now runs the Present Store and appears as a recurring character. He is played by [[Donovan Patton]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Lipton | first = Michael | title = Am I Blue?

His letters contain video messages from children around the world that relate to the episode's topic. Mailbox has a thick [[New York accent#Social and geographic variation|Brooklyn accent]] and likes to crack jokes. He wants to be a comedian when he grows up and has a collection of postage stamps. Although he is normally stationed on a stake in the ground, he can use an \"extendo\" arm to move anywhere around the house or the backyard.

However, she is shy and sometimes lets her lack of confidence prevent her from singing in front of others. She has been known to be sad whenever someone doesn't say \"please\", as proven in the episode \"Blue's Sad Day\". Sidetable likes all kinds of music. Unlike the other characters, Sidetable has an inanimate form without a face that is seen whenever she is not speaking. In the reboot series, her tabletop is square and gains a wooden texture.

A recurring theme throughout the eighteen stories is the conflict of the cold mechanics of [[technology]] and the [[psychology]] of people. It was nominated for the [[International Fantasy Award]] in 1952.<ref>[http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Ifa1952.html Locus Index to SF Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016203418/http://locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Ifa1952.html |date=2012-10-16 }}</ref>\n\nThe unrelated stories are tied together by the [[frame story|frame device]] of \"The Illustrated Man\", a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] former member of a carnival [[freak show]] with an extensively [[tattoo]]ed body whom the unnamed narrator meets. The man's tattoos, allegedly created by a time-traveling woman, are individually animated, and each tells a different tale. All but one of the stories had been published previously elsewhere, although Bradbury revised some of the texts for the book's publication.\n\nThe book was made into the 1969 film, ''[[The Illustrated Man (film)|The Illustrated Man]]'', starring [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Claire Bloom]]. It presented adaptations of the stories \"[[The Veldt (short story)|The Veldt]]\", \"[[The Long Rain]]\" and \"The Last Night of the World\".\n\nA number of the stories, including \"The Veldt\", \"The Fox and the Forest\" (as \"To the Future\"), \"[[Marionettes, Inc.]]\", and \"Zero Hour\" were dramatized for the 1955-1957 radio series ''[[X Minus One]]''. \"The Veldt\", \"The Concrete Mixer\", \"The Long Rain\", \"Zero Hour\", and \"Marionettes Inc.\" were adapted for ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'' television series.\n\n== Story summaries ==\n;\"[[The Veldt (short story)|The Veldt]]\":Parents in a futuristic society worry about their children's mental health when their new virtual reality nursery, which can produce any environment the children imagine, continually projects an African [[veldt]], populated by lions feasting on carcasses. A child psychologist suggests that the automated house is not good for the children's development, nor the parents', and insists they disable the automation and take a vacation to become more self-sufficient. The children are not pleased with this decision but later coolly agree to it. The children trap their parents in the nursery, where they become prey to the lions. They later have lunch on the veldt with the child psychologist. They then see the lions feasting, but do not recognize what has happened.\n;\"Kaleidoscope\": The crew of a space ship drift helplessly through space after their craft malfunctions. The story describes the final thoughts and conversations of the crew members as they face their death. The narrator bitterly reflects on his life and feels he has accomplished nothing worthwhile.

When they learn that a rocket is coming from Earth with [[White people|white]] travellers, they institute a [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] system of [[racial segregation]] in retaliation for how the whites once treated them. When the rocket lands, the travelers tell them that the entire Earth has been destroyed, including all of the horrific mementos of racism (such as trees used for lynching blacks). The blacks take pity on the white travelers and accept them into their new society.\n;\"The Highway\": A husband and wife living by a highway in rural [[Mexico]] live their simple, regimented lives while the highway fills with refugees of a nuclear war. They give assistance to some young travellers, who tell them that the nuclear war means the end of the world. After the travellers leave, the husband wonders what they meant by \"the world\", before returning to his work as normal.\n;\"The Man\": Space explorers find a planet where the population is in a state of bliss. Upon investigation, they discover that an enigmatic visitor came to them, whom the spacemen come to believe is [[Jesus]]. One decides to spend his life rejoicing in the man's glory. Another uses the spaceship to try to catch up to the mysterious traveller, but at each planet he finds that \"He\" has just left after spreading his word. Other members of the crew remain on the planet to learn from the contented citizens, and are rewarded by the discovery that \"He\" is still on the planet.\n;\"[[The Long Rain]]\": A group of astronauts is stranded on [[Venus]], where it rains continually and heavily. The travellers make their way across the Venusian landscape to find a \"sun dome\", a shelter with a large artificial light source. The first sun dome they find has been destroyed by the native Venusians. Searching for another sun dome, the characters, one by one, are driven to madness and suicide by the unrelenting rhythm of the rain. At the end of the story, only one sane astronaut remains to find a functional sun dome.\n;\"The Rocket Man\": Astronauts are few in number, so they work whenever they wish and receive high pay. One such \"Rocket Man\" goes into space for three months at a time, returning to Earth only for three consecutive days to visit his wife and son, Doug. The story is told from the perspective of Doug, who also wants to become a Rocket Man. Doug learns of his father's constant battle, yearning for the stars while at home and yearning for home while in space. The father has attempted to quit several times, because his long absences have nearly destroyed his relationship with his wife. Before leaving for his final three-month mission, the father makes Doug promise he will never follow in his father's footsteps. The father takes off into space, vowing that the next trip will be the last, but dies when his rocket falls into the Sun. His wife and son avoid the Sun out of grief and become nocturnal.\n;\"The Fire Balloons\": A group of priests travels to [[Mars]] to act as [[missionary|missionaries]] to the Martians. They discover that the natives are entities of pure energy. Since they lack corporeal form, they are unable to commit sin, and thus do not need redemption.\n;\"The Last Night of the World\": A married couple awaken to the knowledge that the world is going to end that very evening. Nonetheless, they go through their normal routines, knowing and accepting the fact that there is no tomorrow.\n;\"[[The Exiles (Bradbury story)|The Exiles]]\": Numerous works of literature are banned and burned on Earth. The deceased authors of these books live in a kind of afterlife on Mars. Though dead, they are still vulnerable in the sense that when all of an author's works are destroyed, the author vanishes permanently. The authors learn that people are coming from Earth, and they stage their retribution. Their efforts are foiled when the astronauts burn the last remaining books, annihilating the entire colony.\n<div id=\"npnom\">\n;\"No Particular Night or Morning\": Two friends in a spaceship, Clemens and Hitchcock, discuss the emptiness and cold of space. The slightly eccentric Hitchcock embraces [[solipsism]], and repeatedly insists that nothing in space is real and there is no night or morning. He refuses to believe anything about reality without sufficient evidence and soon becomes skeptical of everything he cannot directly experience. He says that he doesn't believe in stars, because they are too far away. Clemens learns that Hitchcock has left the ship. Hitchcock continues to mumble to himself as he dies of exposure to the void of space.</div>\n;\"The Fox and the Forest\": A couple living in a war-ravaged future society on the brink of collapse uses time travel to escape to 1938 Mexico.

In the struggle, the young man is killed and the escape he provided is lost forever.\n;\"The Concrete Mixer\": A reluctant Martian soldier is forced to join the army as they prepare to invade Earth.

When the Moral Climate Monitors come to visit, each of them is killed in a manner reminiscent of a different Poe story, culminating in the [[immurement]] of the lead inspector. When all of Stendahl's persecutors are dead, the house sinks into the lake.\n\n;\"The Playground\": When Charles Underhill was a boy, he was tormented by neighborhood bullies. When his son begins playing in a local playground, he becomes deeply disturbed when he sees a bully from his youth.\n\n;\"The Illustrated Man\": An overweight carnival worker is given a second chance as a Tattooed Man, and visits a strange woman who applies [[tattoo|skin illustrations]] over his entire body. She covers two special areas, claiming they will show the future. The first is an illustration of the man strangling his wife. Shortly after this comes to pass, the carnival workers run the man down, beat him, and look at the second area. It shows an illustration of the beating in which they are engaged.\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Anthony Boucher|Boucher]] and [[J.

A recurring theme throughout the eighteen stories is the conflict of the cold mechanics of [[technology]] and the [[psychology]] of people. It was nominated for the [[International Fantasy Award]] in 1952.<ref>[http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Ifa1952.html Locus Index to SF Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016203418/http://locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Ifa1952.html |date=2012-10-16 }}</ref>\n\nThe unrelated stories are tied together by the [[frame story|frame device]] of \"The Illustrated Man\", a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] former member of a carnival [[freak show]] with an extensively [[tattoo]]ed body whom the unnamed narrator meets. The man's tattoos, allegedly created by a time-traveling woman, are individually animated and each tells a different tale. All but one of the stories had been published previously elsewhere, although Bradbury revised some of the texts for the book's publication.\n\nThe book was made into the 1969 film, ''[[The Illustrated Man (film)|The Illustrated Man]]'', starring [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Claire Bloom]]. It presented adaptations of the stories \"[[The Veldt (short story)|The Veldt]]\", \"[[The Long Rain]]\" and \"The Last Night of the World\".\n\nA number of the stories, including \"The Veldt\", \"The Fox and the Forest\" (as \"To the Future\"), \"[[Marionettes, Inc.]]\", and \"Zero Hour\" were dramatized for the 1955-1957 radio series ''[[X Minus One]]''. \"The Veldt\", \"The Concrete Mixer\", \"The Long Rain\", \"Zero Hour\", and \"Marionettes Inc.\" were adapted for ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'' television series.\n\n== Story summaries ==\n;\"[[The Veldt (short story)|The Veldt]]\": Parents in a futuristic society worry about their children's mental health when their new virtual reality nursery, which can produce any environment the children imagine, continually projects an African [[veldt]], populated by lions feasting on carcasses. A child psychologist suggests that the automated house is not good for the children's development, nor the parents', and insists they disable the automation and take a vacation to become more self-sufficient. The children are not pleased with this decision, but later coolly agree to it. The children trap their parents in the nursery, where they become prey to the lions. They later have lunch on the veldt with the child psychologist. They then see the lions feasting, but do not recognize what has happened.\n;\"Kaleidoscope\": The crew of a space ship drift helplessly through space after their craft malfunctions. The story describes the final thoughts and conversations of the crew members as they face their death. The narrator bitterly reflects on his life and feels he has accomplished nothing worthwhile. His final thought is a wish that his life would at least be worth something to someone else. As he falls through Earth's atmosphere and is incinerated, he appears as a [[Meteor|shooting star]] to a child in Illinois.\n;\"The Other Foot\": Mars has been colonized solely by [[black people]]. When they learn that a rocket is coming from Earth with [[White people|white]] travellers, they institute a [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] system of [[racial segregation]] in retaliation for how the whites once treated them. When the rocket lands, the travelers tell them that the entire Earth has been destroyed, including all of the horrific mementos of racism (such as trees used for lynching blacks). The blacks take pity on the white travelers and accept them into their new society.\n;\"The Highway\": A husband and wife living by a highway in rural [[Mexico]] live their simple, regimented lives while the highway fills with refugees of a nuclear war. They give assistance to some young travellers, who tell them that the nuclear war means the end of the world. After the travellers leave, the husband wonders what they meant by \"the world\", before returning to his work as normal.\n;\"The Man\": Space explorers find a planet where the population is in a state of bliss. Upon investigation, they discover that an enigmatic visitor came to them, whom the spacemen come to believe is [[Jesus]]. One decides to spend his life rejoicing in the man's glory. Another uses the spaceship to try to catch up to the mysterious traveller, but at each planet he finds that \"He\" has just left after spreading his word. Other members of the crew remain on the planet to learn from the contented citizens, and are rewarded by the discovery that \"He\" is still on the planet.\n;\"[[The Long Rain]]\": A group of astronauts is stranded on [[Venus]], where it rains continually and heavily. The travellers make their way across the Venusian landscape to find a \"sun dome\", a shelter with a large artificial light source. The first sun dome they find has been destroyed by the native Venusians. Searching for another sun dome, the characters, one by one, are driven to madness and suicide by the unrelenting rhythm of the rain. At the end of the story, only one sane astronaut remains to find a functional sun dome.\n;\"The Rocket Man\": Astronauts are few in number, so they work whenever they wish and receive high pay. One such \"Rocket Man\" goes into space for three months at a time, returning to Earth only for three consecutive days to visit his wife and son, Doug. The story is told from the perspective of Doug, who also wants to become a Rocket Man. Doug learns of his father's constant battle, yearning for the stars while at home and yearning for home while in space. The father has attempted to quit several times, because his long absences have nearly destroyed his relationship with his wife. Before leaving for his final three-month mission, the father makes Doug promise he will never follow in his father's footsteps. The father takes off into space, vowing that the next trip will be the last, but dies when his rocket falls into the Sun. His wife and son avoid the Sun out of grief and become nocturnal.\n;\"The Fire Balloons\": A group of priests travels to [[Mars]] to act as [[missionary|missionaries]] to the Martians. They discover that the natives are entities of pure energy. Since they lack corporeal form, they are unable to commit sin, and thus do not need redemption.\n;\"The Last Night of the World\": A married couple awaken to the knowledge that the world is going to end that very evening. Nonetheless, they go through their normal routines, knowing and accepting the fact that there is no tomorrow.\n;\"[[The Exiles (Bradbury story)|The Exiles]]\": Numerous works of literature are banned and burned on Earth. The deceased authors of these books live in a kind of afterlife on Mars. Though dead, they are still vulnerable in the sense that when all of an author's works are destroyed, the author vanishes permanently. The authors learn that people are coming from Earth, and they stage their retribution. Their efforts are foiled when the astronauts burn the last remaining books, annihilating the entire colony.\n<div id=\"npnom\">\n;\"No Particular Night or Morning\": Two friends in a spaceship, Clemens and Hitchcock, discuss the emptiness and cold of space. The slightly eccentric Hitchcock embraces [[solipsism]], and repeatedly insists that nothing in space is real and there is no night or morning. He refuses to believe anything about reality without sufficient evidence and soon becomes skeptical of everything he cannot directly experience. He says that he doesn't believe in stars, because they are too far away. Clemens learns that Hitchcock has left the ship. Hitchcock continues to mumble to himself as he dies of exposure to the void of space.</div>\n;\"The Fox and the Forest\": A couple living in a war-ravaged future society on the brink of collapse uses time travel to escape to 1938 Mexico. They and others before them have used the technology to enjoy life before chemical, nuclear, and biological warfare ruined everything. Unfortunately, the authorities have also traveled back in time to return the exiles to the future.\n;\"The Visitor\": [[Mars]] is used as [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] for people with deadly illnesses. One day, the planet is visited by a young man of 18 who has the ability to perform [[telepathy]]. The exiles on the planet are thrilled with his ability and a violent fight breaks out over who will get to spend the most time with their visitor and enjoy the illusionary paradises he can transmit. In the struggle, the young man is killed and the escape he provided is lost forever.\n;\"The Concrete Mixer\": A reluctant Martian soldier is forced to join the army as they prepare to invade Earth. When they arrive, they are welcomed by a world at peace, full of people who are curious rather than aggressive. The protagonist meets a movie director, and it becomes clear that the people of Earth have planned to exploit the Martians for financial gain. He tries to escape to Mars, but is run over by a car and killed.\n;\"[[Marionettes, Inc.]]\": An unhappily married man buys a realistic robot to act as a surrogate so that he doesn't have to deal with his wife, who trapped him into marriage by getting pregnant and threatening to turn him in for rape if he leaves her. When a friend decides to purchase his own robot, he discovers that his wife already has replaced herself with one. The robot of the protagonist falls in love with the man's wife, and locks the real man in the crate in which the robot was delivered.<ref>2001 printing by William Morrow{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}</ref>\n;\"The City\": A rocket expedition from Earth lands on an uncharted planet and finds a seemingly empty city. As the humans begin to explore, they realize that the city is not as empty as it seems. The city was waiting for the arrival of humans, designed by a long dead civilization to take revenge upon humanity; the civilization was destroyed by human biological weapons before recorded history. Once the city captures and kills the human astronauts, the humans' corpses are used as automatons to take a final act of revenge&nbsp;\u2014 a biological attack on the Earth.\n;\"Zero Hour\": Children across the country are deeply involved in an exciting game they call \"Invasion\". Their parents think of it as harmless fun until the invasion actually occurs.\n;\"[[The Rocket (short story)|The Rocket]]\" : Fiorello Bodoni, a poor [[Wrecking yard|junkyard]] owner, has saved $3,000 to fulfill his dream to send one member of his family into outer space. The family cannot choose who will go, fearing those left behind will resent the one chosen. Bodoni instead uses the money to build a replica rocket containing a virtual reality theater that simulates a voyage through space.\n\n== Other versions ==\nThe British edition, first published in 1952 by [[Rupert Hart-Davis|Hart-Davis]] omits \"The Rocket Man\", \"The Fire Balloons\", \"The Exiles\" and \"The Concrete Mixer\", and adds \"Usher II\" from ''The Martian Chronicles'' and \"The Playground\".\n\nEditions published by [[Avon Books]] in 1997 and [[William Morrow and Company|William Morrow]] in 2001 omit \"The Fire Balloons\" and add \"The Illustrated Man\" to the end of the book.\n\n;\"Usher II\": Literary expert William Stendahl has retreated to Mars to escape the book-burning dictates of the Moral Climate Monitors. On Mars he has built his image of the perfect haunted mansion, replicating the building from [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\", complete with mechanical creatures, creepy soundtracks and the extermination of all life in the surrounding area.

The water tower is located at 100 Utility Street, Bunnell, FL 32110. It was built in 1926 by [[Chicago Bridge & Iron Company]] as part of a new waterworks system for Bunnell that went into operation in December 1927 and has been providing water to residents and local businesses to this day. The water tower is 110 feet high and its elevated steel tank holds 75,000 gallons of water. The elevated steel water tank has a conical top, Horton hemispherical bottom and is supported by four steel columns (legs) and reinforced with steel cross braces. The east and west sides of the elevated tank have black painted signage that read \u201cCity of Bunnell, Crossroads of Flagler County\u201d<ref name=\"JayeR\"/><ref name=\"JayeR_2\"/>\n\n==Water works system project of 1927==\n\nIn January 1927, Bunnell signed a contract with the Gray Artesian Well Company of St. Augustine to drill a well approximately 90 feet deep with casing that is suitable for pumping for the new waterworks system. After the well was completed water was tested by the Florida State Board of Health who declared it to be of fine quality, pure with no color or taste and with only three hundred to a million hardness. A second well was drilled so there would be a sufficient quantity of water for the city as it grew. The contracted price for these wells was $2,375 each.<ref name=\"Civic\"/>\n\nBids for furnishing materials, labor and construction for the new waterworks were opened on March 28, 1927. More than fifteen bids were received by Engineer N.A. Hotard. On April 11, 1927, the Bunnell city commission awarded the contract to the Hopper Construction Company.<ref name=\"Bids\"/>\n\nOn July 7, 1927, material began arriving at the site of the new water plant, which was determined by the newly dug artesian wells. F.W. Hopper, of the Hooper Construction Company, stated that the project would most likely be finished in 140 working days and ahead of schedule. Construction of the new water system did move fast and by September 8, 1927 the majority of the main pipes and fire hydrants were installed and concrete forms for the reservoir were nearly completed. Representatives from the Chicago Bridge & Iron Works were working on erecting the steel water tank and its tower. The city purchased the steel water tower through the J.B. McCrary Company.<ref name=\"Fast\"/>\n\nOn October 27, 1927, Engineer Paynter, who was leading the construction project of the new waterworks predicted that the system would be operational by December 1, 1927 despite a pump that was scheduled to arrive late. Paynter also announced that the new system could temporarily be connected to the present water source until the new wells and pumps are available. The potential delay regarding cutting up sections of State Road No. 4 was avoided when chairman of the Bunnell city commission, J.J. McLanahan, announced that a satisfactory agreement with State Road Engineer Thrasher was reached. The agreement details were that four places in State Road No. 4 will be cut up and after the water mains are installed the trenches will be covered and refilled with concrete.<ref name=\"Soon\"/>\n\nOn December 1, 1927, Bunnell City Clerk, John Gerz, announced that due to a few construction delays the new waterworks system should be operational within the next two weeks. Some water meters were still pending installation but Gerz said they would be ready when the new system is ready to be turned on. Bunnell officials said, \u201cthis will prove in time [to be] one of the best advertisements for Bunnell that could be named\u201d.<ref name=\"Soon\" />\n\n==New water works system put into operation in 1927==\n\n[[File:Bunnell Water Tower - Full West View of Water Tower.jpg|thumb|right|Bunnell Water Tower - Full West View of Water Tower.]]\n\nOn December 12, 1927, Bunnell's new waterworks system went operational. Almost immediately the old system's lines were cut off and all consumers were connected onto the new waterworks system. The ''Flagler Tribune'' reported on December 15, 1927 that \u201cOne of the most important events ever to occur in Bunnell took place this week when the new $100,000 waterworks system was turned on for the first time\u2026\u201d The new waterworks system included several miles of 10, 8, 6 and 2 inch mains that were laid on all city streets, fire hydrants, an elevated steel water tank on tower, storage reservoir and a pumping station.

Initially, it was assumed that the new channels would be BBC-branded but Flextech wanted the channels to have advertisements.  The BBC argued that BBC-branded services in the UK should not carry advertising, and thought that this would undermine the rationale of the license fee in the UK.

The BBC argued that BBC-branded services in the UK should not carry advertising, and thought that this would undermine the rationale of the license fee in the UK.

New carriage agreements secured wholesale distribution of Sky's basic channel line-up, including Sky1 and Sky Arts, and the VMtv channels, on Virgin Media's cable TV service. For an incremental wholesale fee, Virgin Media, for the first time, had the option of carrying any of Sky's basic HD channels, Sky Sports HD 1 and Sky Sports HD 2, and all Sky Movies HD channels.
