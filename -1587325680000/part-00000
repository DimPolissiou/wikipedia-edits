{"title_page": "Kavi Kunjara Bharati", "text_new": "{{cleanup|date=August 2011}}\n{{no footnotes|date=January 2020}}\n'''Kavi Kunjara Bharati''' (1810\u20131896) was a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poet and a composer of [[Carnatic music]]. He was born in a family with long involvement in music and scholarship.\n\n== Ancestry ==\nHis ancestors belonged to Tirunelveli district. His parents lived in the village of Perungarai in Ramanathapuram district. It is said the whole village was a gift from Maharaja Ragunatha Sethupathi (1675\u20131670) to their family.  His given name was Koteeswara Bharathi after his grandfather with the same name. His father was Subramanya Bharathi.  His father and grandfather were also well known musicians as well as his maternal grandfather, Nandanur Nagabharathi. Father Subramanya Bharathi and grandfather Kotiswara Bharathi were also scholars in Tamil and [[Sanskrit]]. His parents, who were longing to have a child, prayed weekly at the Murugan temple in Kodumalur (near Perungarai) and the child was considered to be blessed by Lord Muruga.\n\nIn his early boyhood he was taught  Sanskrit and Tamil and thanks to his brilliance in poetry, language skills and music, he developed an intellectual relationship with the then famous poet Madurakavi Bharathiar. One could imagine fruitful discussions among the two in the presence of their families and Koteeswara Bharthi, at the early age of 12 started composing [[kirtan|kirtanams]] and [[prabandha]]s in the praise of his favourite gods Muruga, Meenalkshi Sundareswarar and Subrahmanya. \nWhen he was 18, he became critically ill and at this stage, the legend says that the local deity appeared in his dreams and told him to compose songs in her praise in order to get well. The next day he found that he was feeling much stronger and full of verve. He then fulfilled the deity's wish and composed a [[prabandha]] in the name of the deity and sang it in the temple.\n\nHis most famous work, the Opera \"Azhahar Kuravanji\", was composed in 1840. It was first sung in a zamindar's palace in Sivaganga and soon his fame spread all over the region. He was then invited by King Gouri Vallabha of [[Sivaganga]] to present his works in the presence of the intellectual community in his palace which he did with brilliance. He was then given the title \"Kavi Kunjaram\" and was appointed as the \"Asthana Vidwan\" in his court. He was thus respected by the royal court of Sivaganga and he continued to be in the court of the later Sivaganga king \"Chatrapathi Bodaguru\". He is known to have composed \"Vengai kummi\" to commemorate the hunting prowess of the king after he killed a 16-foot tiger. The king was so pleased that he presented him with a village called \"Kottangachi yendal\" and was accompanied by royal presents and traveled in a royal palanquin to his village \n\nHe was later invited by the king of Ramnad to his court and was appointed as Asthana Vidwan of Ramnad, too. To fulfil the royal desire he created a  collection called \"Skaanda purana Kirtanai\" on the mystery of lord Subramanya's avatar. He was about 55 by the time the book was released. He then lived a pious and respected life in his village. There are tales of him creating a \"Venba\" to provoke rainfall in his village and a prayer he composed to cure his buffalo. At the age of 86, he passed away surrounded by his loved ones and full of prayers and divine thoughts.\n\n== Works ==\nThe collection of his compositions include, ''Azhahar Kuravanji'' in praise of Maliruncholamali Azhahar, ''Adaikkala malai'', and ''Kayarkani malai'' in praise of Meenakshi Amman and Tiruvangaada Malai \"in praise of Lord Venkatachalapathi. His other notable contribution is a collection called ''Perinbha kirthanaigal''.\n\nA few works are available giving a glimpse of his beautiful compositions.  ''Azhahar Kuravanji'', itself was first released with full notations by his illustrious grandson Koteeswara Ayyar in 1916 along with the Skaanda puranam and Perinba kirtahanigal in three volumes.\n\nKoteeswara Ayyar is known for his compositions in the 72 Melakarta ragas. There is a small confusion between the two composers, as they have almost the same \"mudrai\". To avoid this confusion, Kavi Kunjara Bharathi used \"kavikunjaram\" as his mudrai and Koteeswara ayyar's mudrai was \"kavikunjara dasan\". In fact, the first volume of the 36 suddha madyama [[melakarta]]s by Shri Koteeswara ayyar -- called \"Kanda ganamudham\" is dedicated to his maternal grandfather Kavi Kunjara Bharathi. \n\nA more recent version of ''Azahar Kuravanji'' was released by K. Nagamani, the son of Koteeswara Ayyar. Here are some of his other famous compositions:\n\n*Elloraiyum Polave - Suddhasaveri \n*Ennadi Penne Unakku - Begada \n*Pithanavan - Anandbairavi \n*Singaravelanai - Danyasi \n*Sannidhi Kandu - Mohanam\n\nThe first song was the favourite of S.G. Kittappa and T.R. Mahalingam who have given disc recordings of it.\n\n== Azhahar Kuravanji ==\n\nKuravanjis are dance-dramas in Tamil half way between Bhaagavatha Mela Naataka and rustic dance-dramas. The accent is on high entertainment value with the use of Rakti [[raaga]]s and folk tunes. Rhythmic sol-fa passages and onomatopoeic phrases are used to enliven the pure dance passages.\n\nAzhahar Kuravanji is the story of the heroine falling in love with Maalazhagar. The first invocatory song in Kanada is in Sanskrit and here one can read the mudrai \"Hitha kunjara bhanita\" in the charanam. In fact, this first song itself shows that Kavikunjara Bhaarathi, a contemporary of Shri Tyaagaraaja, has adopted the classical division of the composition into pallavi, anupallavi and Charanam.\n\nA beautiful description of Maalazhagar surrounded by his devotees performing all services follows in the Saaranga raga song. The arrival of Mohanavalli along with her sakhis is portrayed in the Khamaas raaga composition.\n \nA few lines like the ones below makes one imagine the beautiful heroine playing ball with her friends\n\n<poem>\n\"Chandranenum vadanattil oli minna \nTakatakajjanu takadari kitutajanu takadom enrani \nMohanavalli pandu aadinaal\"\n</poem>\n\nThis song is followed by a classical kummi in Maanji raagam. \n\nAn interesting phraseology can be seen in the 3rd charanam:\n\n:\"Mohanavalli yamuda valliyadi,\n:Muthuvalli adiyadi chitravalli.\n:Naagavalli pachundothihai valli, nava\n:Ratnavalli yaalnanda valli\".\n\nMaalazhagar comes in procession and Mohanavalli immediately falls in love with him. The famous song \"Ivanaro in Khamboji\"\nThe astonished heroine says (in the first charanam):\n\n:\"paadathiloru mangai pakkatiloru mangai,\n:Cheedattulavam poonda tirumaarbiloru mangai\n:Yedukkai anindano ivan daan en perumaano\"\n \nMohanavalli is love-stricken and her mother is worried about her daughter's plight.\nThis is depicted in the song in Kaapi:\n\n:\"Malaiyum chempon olaiyum Varna\n:chelaiyum aniyaamal\n:Kaalaiyum andimaalaiyum ennam\n:Kalangi urakkam vilangiye miha endan{{typo help inline|reason=similar to indan|date=October 2019}}<br/>\n:Mahal ennamo oru\n:Vahaiyaha irukkiraale\"\n\nMohanavalli's Sakhi is then sent to Azhahar where she conveys the heroine's feelings in the beautiful song in Maanji \"Mohanavalli minnal\". The sakhi then consoles the heroine and asks her to be patient in the song in Kedaaragowla  \"paavaiye sami varumun ittanai padattam tan unakkenadi\". Mohanavalli then laments to the ocean about her love in the Chenchurutti song and she rebukes the moon on being cruel towards her in the song in Behag. Enters the Gypsy in the famous song in Begada \"maalai Kuravanji Vandaale\". The gypsy woman's beauty is described in the second charanam:\n\n:\"Minnalennum idaiyaal \u2013 annamennum nadaiyaal\n:Menkai ilangiya kanganavosai\n:Kaleen kaleen enru kulunga nalangodu\n:Maalai Kuravanji Vandaale\"\n\nOne can see the use of onomatopoeia to bring out the movement of the hands and the tinkling of bracelets.\nThis is then followed by a fairly long passage describing the Gypsy tribe and their ways. There is a full description of the flora and fauna and it would be interesting to compare the current eco-system with the one described in this kuravanji.\n\nIn the Bhairavi song the gypsy vaunts of her capacities as in these lines:\n\n:\"kallinum naar iruppen \u2013 manalaiyum\n:Kayirena thirippen nalla\n:Vallamaiyayangai nelli-k- kaniyena \n:Chollum kurikondu velluven\"\n\nMohanavalli requests the gypsy to read her palm lines and the gypsy then starts the rituals before undertaking this task. She finally predicts the heroine's future and assures her that her wishes will be fulfilled. The gypsy announces the arrival of Maalazhahar in the romantic Sahaana raaga song \"Vandu cheruvar maane\".\n\nThe final marriage scene is described in the song in Mohanam. This is followed by a secondary folk theme on the marriage of the gypsy woman. The play ends with a mangalam in Sauraashtram.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Carnatic composers]]\n\n== Sources ==\n\n* Kavi Kunjara Bharthi, Madurakavi Bharathi padangal and Ramakavirayar padangal, pammal vijayaranga Mudaliyar, 1889, Madras\n* Azhahar Kuravanji, K.Nagamani, Alliance Press, Chennai, 1963\n* Kandaganamudam, N.Koteeswara Ayyar, The Madras law Journal press, Mylapore, 1932.\n* http://www.indian-heritage.org/music/garlandk.htm\n\n==External links==\n* [http://carnatica.net/composer/kavikunjarabharati.htm Carnatica.net]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bharati, Kavi Kunjara}}\n[[Category:Carnatic composers]]\n[[Category:1810 births]]\n[[Category:1896 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century classical composers]]\n", "text_old": "{{cleanup|date=August 2011}}\n{{no footnotes|date=January 2020}}\n'''Kavi Kunjara Bharati''' (1810\u20131896) was a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poet and a composer of [[Carnatic music]].

The famous song \"Ivanaro in Khamboji\"\nThe astonished heroine says (in the first charanam):\n\n\"paadathiloru mangai pakkatiloru mangai,<br/>\nCheedattulavam poonda tirumaarbiloru mangai<br/>\nYedukkai anindano ivan daan en perumaano\"<br/>\n \nMohanavalli is love- stricken and her mother is worried about her daughter's plight.\nThis is depicted in the song in Kaapi:\n\n\"Malaiyum chempon olaiyum Varna <br/>\nchelaiyum aniyaamal<br/>\nKaalaiyum andimaalaiyum ennam<br/>\nKalangi urakkam vilangiye miha endan{{typo help inline|reason=similar to indan|date=October 2019}}<br/>\nMahal ennamo oru <br/>\nVahaiyaha irukkiraale\"<br/>\n\nMohanavalli's Sakhi is then sent to Azhahar where she conveys the heroine's feelings in the beautiful song in Maanji \"Mohanavalli minnal\". The sakhi then consoles the heroine and asks her to be patient in the song in Kedaaragowla  \"paavaiye sami varumun ittanai padattam tan unakkenadi\". Mohanavalli then laments to the ocean about her love in the Chenchurutti song and she rebukes the moon on being cruel towards her in the song in Behag. Enters the Gypsy in the famous song in Begada \"maalai Kuravanji Vandaale\". The gypsy woman's beauty is described in the second charanam:\n\n\"Minnalennum idaiyaal \u2013 annamennum nadaiyaal<br />\nMenkai ilangiya kanganavosai<br />\nKaleen kaleen enru kulunga nalangodu<br />\nMaalai Kuravanji Vandaale\"<br />\n\nOne can see the use of onomatopoeia to bring out the movement of the hands and the tinkling of bracelets.\nThis is then followed by a fairly long passage describing the Gypsy tribe and their ways. There is a full description of the flora and fauna and it would be interesting to compare the current eco-system with the one described in this kuravanji.\nIn the Bhairavi song the gypsy vaunts of her capacities as in these lines\n\n\"kallinum naar iruppen \u2013 manalaiyum<br />\nKayirena thirippen nalla<br />\nVallamaiyayangai nelli-k- kaniyena<br /> \nChollum kurikondu velluven\"<br />\n\nMohanavalli requests the gypsy to read her palm lines and the gypsy then starts the rituals before undertaking this task. She finally predicts the heroine's future and assures her that her wishes will be fulfilled. The gypsy announces the arrival of Maalazhahar in the romantic Sahaana raaga song \"Vandu cheruvar maane\".\n\nThe final marriage scene is described in the song in Mohanam. This is followed by a secondary folk theme on the marriage of the gypsy woman. The play ends with a mangalam in Sauraashtram.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Carnatic composers]]\n\n== Sources ==\n\n# Kavi Kunjara Bharthi, Madurakavi Bharathi padangal and Ramakavirayar padangal, pammal vijayaranga Mudaliyar, 1889, Madras\n# Azhahar Kuravanji, K.Nagamani, Alliance Press, Chennai, 1963\n# Kandaganamudam, N.Koteeswara Ayyar, The Madras law Journal press, Mylapore, 1932.\n# http://www.indian-heritage.org/music/garlandk.htm\n\n==External linkss==\n* [http://carnatica.net/composer/kavikunjarabharati.htm Carnatica.net]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bharati, Kavi Kunjara}}\n[[Category:Carnatic composers]]\n[[Category:1810 births]]\n[[Category:1896 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century classical composers]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "copy edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavi_Kunjara_Bharati"}

At Penn he formed and chaired the Penn Voters Rights Council, and won a successful lawsuit (Fair v. Osser) which won Pennsylvania students the right to register to vote from their campus addresses. He also led Penn People for George McGovern in the 1972 Democratic presidential primary in Pennsylvania. He graduated with a degree in Political Science in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://afamaidsoralhistory.wordpress.com/interviews/|title=Interviews|date=24 September 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== The Seventies ==\nFair formally \u201ccame out\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waygay.org/40-years40-stories/2015/10/26/david-fair-1976|title=David Fair - 1976|publisher=}}</ref> in 1976 at a meeting of a group of gay and bisexual married men held at the nascent Gay Community Center of Philadelphia. He soon became active in several local gay organizations, including Gays at Penn (GAP). In 1977, GAP led a successful effort to force the university to adopt a sexual orientation nondiscrimination policy. Fair, then an administrator at a local Episcopal Church based on campus, leveraged that activism to organize a group to form a progressive lesbian and gay rights organization, the Philadelphia Lesbian and Gay Task Force (PLGTF). In 1978, Fair led the effort to put on the first gay and lesbian cultural festival outside of New York and California, called the Philadelphia Gay Cultural Festival, which held over 20 events in 1978 and 1979 including films, theatrical performances, comedy performances, lectures and social events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/185374355/?terms=%22david+fair%22|title=10 Apr 1979, Page 27 - Philadelphia Daily News at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> In the summer of 1979, Fair helped form an LGBT Health Committee of the PLGTF, which later formed Lavender Health, later renamed the Mazzoni Center, in honor of physician [[Peter Mazzoni]].\n\n== Labor and AIDS Activism ==\nAlong with fellow LGBT Democratic Party activist Scott Wilds and others,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://library.temple.edu/scrc/scott-wilds-collection|title=Special Collections Research Center - Temple University Libraries|website=library.temple.edu}}</ref> Fair formed a 1979 campaign committee to support pro-LGBT City Councilman [[Lucien Blackwell]], but the campaign was unsuccessful. However, the effort drew the attention of the politically powerful local labor leader Henry Nicholas, president of the local affiliate of [[1199: The National Health Care Workers' Union|1199: The National Health Care Workers Union]], who hired Fair as his executive assistant in 1980. In 1985, Fair was elected the Union's first openly-gay officer, Secretary-Treasurer, and as a Vice President of the Union's national organization. During his tenure at the Union from 1980\u201388, Fair was the media spokesperson<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/172058335/?terms=%22david+fair%22|title=14 Jun 1981, Page 27 - The Philadelphia Inquirer at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> for the union and was involved in numerous strikes and protests, being arrested by Philadelphia police 13 times.\n\nWhile at 1199, Fair also became a leading advocate against homelessness in Philadelphia. He was active in the Committee for Dignity and Fairness to the Homeless, Dignity Housing, and other ad hoc groups, and helped to form the Philadelphia/Delaware Valley Union of the Homeless and its chapters in New York and Baltimore.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/174577148/?terms=%22david+fair%22|title=8 Apr 1985, Page 15 - The Philadelphia Inquirer at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> At its height, the [[National Union of the Homeless]] had over 15,000 members.\n\nThe city's largest social services union, 1199 also became a base for Fair to build bridges between the union's largely black membership and LGBT and AIDS activism. In 1980-82, he and Wilds formed Gay Campaign 80 and the Philadelphia Equal Rights Coalition, successful efforts to elect LGBT people to various neighborhood party posts in the city. The organizing efforts garnered the attention of the Philadelphia Inquirer, which published an article on the growing influence of LGBT political activism in the city featuring Wilds and Fair.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/184528456/?terms=%22david+fair%22+gay|title=23 Apr 1984, Page 4 - Philadelphia Daily News at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> The union hall became a major meeting place for LGBT and progressive organizations, and Fair took advantage of his new connections in the black political networks in which 1199 was prominent to influence black elected officials on LGBT issues. These connections and other organizing efforts<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/184528456/?terms=%22david+fair%22|title=23 Apr 1984, Page 4 - Philadelphia Daily News at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> by Fair, Wilds, Lisa Bacon, Rita Addessa (head of PLGTF), Doug Bowman and many others were instrumental in the passage of a 1982 amendment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/civil-rights-lgbt/philadelphia-gay-rights-bill-3/|title=Philadelphia Gay Rights Bill, 1982 - Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|website=philadelphiaencyclopedia.org}}</ref> to the Philadelphia Fair Practices Act prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Union, which itself had a large black LGBT membership, also became the base of Gay and Lesbian Friends of Wilson Goode, chaired by Fair. Goode was elected Philadelphia's [[Wilson Goode|first black mayor]] in 1983. In 1984, Goode appointed Fair to form the city's first Mayor's Commission on Sexual Minorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/184506991/?terms=%22david+fair%22+gay|title=3 Mar 1984, Page 8 - Philadelphia Daily News at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> Also that year, Fair began years of anti-racist activism<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/186084252/?terms=%22david+fair%22|title=3 Oct 1986, Page 5 - Philadelphia Daily News at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> within the [[LGBT community]] with a speech to the annual dinner of Black and White Men Together Philadelphia, a local multiracial LGBT group which was honoring Fair with a community service award. In that speech, Fair decried the dominance of racist attitudes in the local white gay community, using as a prime example the closing of the only LGBT mental health agency in the city once it began to serve a predominately people of color clientele.\n\nIn 1985, as the AIDS epidemic grew in both the LGBT and racial minority communities, Fair got Goode to create the Mayor's Commission on Health Emergencies, the first effort in the city government to create a local response to the AIDS epidemic. That same year, Fair gave the fledgling AIDS prevention organization, Blacks Educating Blacks About Sexual Health Issues (BEBASHI) its first office space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/aids-and-aids-activism/|title=AIDS and AIDS Activism - Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|website=philadelphiaencyclopedia.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, Fair authored ''AIDS and Minorities in Philadelphia'' for BEBASHI and began participating in the organizing of African American and Latino LGBT people to combat the epidemic in their own communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/168779087/?terms=%22david+fair%22+gay|title=11 Mar 1986, Page 15 - The Philadelphia Inquirer at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> At the 1986 national convention of the [[National Association of Black and White Men Together]], Fair gave the keynote speech<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uofsAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT19&lpg=PT19&dq=%22david+fair%22+gay+speeches&source=bl&ots=K8vLAxk54r&sig=bJjGp1fze7lZaCi3umA5uvcysrI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiZhOnDmMbYAhUNON8KHfFRCAUQ6AEIOTAH#v=onepage&q=%22david+fair%22+gay+speeches&f=false|title=Speaking for Our Lives: Historic Speeches and Rhetoric for Gay and Lesbian Rights (1892-2000)|first=Robert B.|last=Ridinger|date=25 February 2014|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}</ref> on white gay racism, which was later published in ''Speaking for Our Lives: Historic Speeches and Rhetoric for Gay and Lesbian Rights 1892-2000''.

At Penn he formed and chaired the Penn Voters Rights Council, and won a successful lawsuit (Fair v. Osser) which won Pennsylvania students the right to register to vote from their campus addresses. He also led Penn People for George McGovern in the 1972 Democratic presidential primary in Pennsylvania. He graduated with a degree in Political Science in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://afamaidsoralhistory.wordpress.com/interviews/|title=Interviews|date=24 September 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== The Seventies ==\nFair formally \u201ccame out\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waygay.org/40-years40-stories/2015/10/26/david-fair-1976|title=David Fair - 1976|publisher=}}</ref> in 1976 at a meeting of a group of gay and bisexual married men held at the nascent Gay Community Center of Philadelphia. He soon became active in several local gay organizations, including Gays at Penn (GAP). In 1977, GAP led a successful effort to force the university to adopt a sexual orientation nondiscrimination policy. Fair, then an administrator at a local Episcopal Church based on campus, leveraged that activism to organize a group to form a progressive lesbian and gay rights organization, the Philadelphia Lesbian and Gay Task Force (PLGTF). In 1978, Fair led the effort to put on the first gay and lesbian cultural festival outside of New York and California, called the Philadelphia Gay Cultural Festival, which held over 20 events in 1978 and 1979 including films, theatrical performances, comedy performances, lectures and social events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/185374355/?terms=%22david+fair%22|title=10 Apr 1979, Page 27 - Philadelphia Daily News at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> In the summer of 1979, Fair helped form an LGBT Health Committee of the PLGTF, which later formed Lavender Health, later renamed the Mazzoni Center, in honor of physician [[Peter Mazzoni]].\n\n== Labor and AIDS Activism ==\nAlong with fellow LGBT Democratic Party activist Scott Wilds and others,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://library.temple.edu/scrc/scott-wilds-collection|title=Special Collections Research Center - Temple University Libraries|website=library.temple.edu}}</ref> Fair formed a 1979 campaign committee to support pro-LGBT City Councilman [[Lucien Blackwell]], but the campaign was unsuccessful. However, the effort drew the attention of the politically powerful local labor leader Henry Nicholas, president of the local affiliate of [[1199: The National Health Care Workers' Union|1199: The National Health Care Workers Union]], who hired Fair as his executive assistant in 1980. In 1985, Fair was elected the Union's first openly-gay officer, Secretary-Treasurer, and as a Vice President of the Union's national organization. During his tenure at the Union from 1980\u201388, Fair was the media spokesperson<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/172058335/?terms=%22david+fair%22|title=14 Jun 1981, Page 27 - The Philadelphia Inquirer at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> for the union and was involved in numerous strikes and protests, being arrested by Philadelphia police 13 times.\n\nWhile at 1199, Fair also became a leading advocate against homelessness in Philadelphia. He was active in the Committee for Dignity and Fairness to the Homeless, Dignity Housing, and other ad hoc groups, and helped to form the Philadelphia/Delaware Valley Union of the Homeless and its chapters in New York and Baltimore.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/174577148/?terms=%22david+fair%22|title=8 Apr 1985, Page 15 - The Philadelphia Inquirer at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> At its height, the [[National Union of the Homeless]] had over 15,000 members.\n\nThe city's largest social services union, 1199 also became a base for Fair to build bridges between the union's largely black membership and LGBT and AIDS activism. In 1980-82, he and Wilds formed Gay Campaign 80 and the Philadelphia Equal Rights Coalition, successful efforts to elect LGBT people to various neighborhood party posts in the city. The organizing efforts garnered the attention of the Philadelphia Inquirer, which published an article on the growing influence of LGBT political activism in the city featuring Wilds and Fair.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/184528456/?terms=%22david+fair%22+gay|title=23 Apr 1984, Page 4 - Philadelphia Daily News at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> The union hall became a major meeting place for LGBT and progressive organizations, and Fair took advantage of his new connections in the black political networks in which 1199 was prominent to influence black elected officials on LGBT issues. These connections and other organizing efforts<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/184528456/?terms=%22david+fair%22|title=23 Apr 1984, Page 4 - Philadelphia Daily News at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> by Fair, Wilds, Lisa Bacon, Rita Addessa (head of PLGTF), Doug Bowman and many others were instrumental in the passage of a 1982 amendment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/civil-rights-lgbt/philadelphia-gay-rights-bill-3/|title=Philadelphia Gay Rights Bill, 1982 - Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|website=philadelphiaencyclopedia.org}}</ref> to the Philadelphia Fair Practices Act prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Union, which itself had a large black LGBT membership, also became the base of Gay and Lesbian Friends of Wilson Goode, chaired by Fair. Goode was elected Philadelphia's [[Wilson Goode|first black mayor]] in 1983. In 1984, Goode appointed Fair to form the city's first Mayor's Commission on Sexual Minorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/184506991/?terms=%22david+fair%22+gay|title=3 Mar 1984, Page 8 - Philadelphia Daily News at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> Also that year, Fair began years of anti-racist activism<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/186084252/?terms=%22david+fair%22|title=3 Oct 1986, Page 5 - Philadelphia Daily News at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> within the [[LGBT community]] with a speech to the annual dinner of Black and White Men Together Philadelphia, a local multiracial LGBT group which was honoring Fair with a community service award. In that speech, Fair decried the dominance of racist attitudes in the local white gay community, using as a prime example the closing of the only LGBT mental health agency in the city once it began to serve a predominately people of color clientele.\n\nIn 1985, as the AIDS epidemic grew in both the LGBT and racial minority communities, Fair got Goode to create the Mayor's Commission on Health Emergencies, the first effort in the city government to create a local response to the AIDS epidemic. That same year, Fair gave the fledgling AIDS prevention organization, Blacks Educating Blacks About Sexual Health Issues (BEBASHI) its first office space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/aids-and-aids-activism/|title=AIDS and AIDS Activism - Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|website=philadelphiaencyclopedia.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, Fair authored ''AIDS and Minorities in Philadelphia'' for BEBASHI and began participating in the organizing of African American and Latino LGBT people to combat the epidemic in their own communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/168779087/?terms=%22david+fair%22+gay|title=11 Mar 1986, Page 15 - The Philadelphia Inquirer at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}</ref> At the 1986 national convention of the [[National Association of Black and White Men Together]], Fair gave the keynote speech<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uofsAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT19&lpg=PT19&dq=%22david+fair%22+gay+speeches&source=bl&ots=K8vLAxk54r&sig=bJjGp1fze7lZaCi3umA5uvcysrI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiZhOnDmMbYAhUNON8KHfFRCAUQ6AEIOTAH#v=onepage&q=%22david+fair%22+gay+speeches&f=false|title=Speaking for Our Lives: Historic Speeches and Rhetoric for Gay and Lesbian Rights (1892-2000)|first=Robert B.|last=Ridinger|date=25 February 2014|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}</ref> on white gay racism, which was later published in ''Speaking for Our Lives: Historic Speeches and Rhetoric for Gay and Lesbian Rights 1892-2000''.
