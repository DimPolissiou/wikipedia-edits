It is used for [[medical imaging]] and industrial [[nondestructive testing]] (NDT). Optical coherence tomography is based on low-coherence [[interferometry]], typically employing [[near-infrared]] light. The use of relatively long [[wavelength]] light allows it to penetrate into the scattering medium. [[Confocal microscopy]], another optical technique, typically penetrates less deeply into the sample but with higher resolution.\n\nDepending on the properties of the light source ([[superluminescent diode]]s, [[ultrashort pulse laser|ultrashort pulsed lasers]], and [[supercontinuum]] lasers have been employed), optical coherence tomography has achieved sub-[[Micrometre|micrometer]] resolution (with very wide-spectrum sources emitting over a ~100&nbsp;nm wavelength range).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}{{verification needed|reason=confocal microscopy typically has a resolution of about 1 um and it is stated earlier that confocal microscopy has better resolution than OCT, so need to substantiate this claim|date=June 2015}}\n\nOptical coherence tomography is one of a class of [[optical tomography|optical tomographic]] techniques.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Commercially available optical coherence tomography systems are employed in diverse applications, including art conservation and diagnostic medicine, notably in [[ophthalmology]] and [[optometry]] where it can be used to obtain detailed images from within the retina.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Recently, it has also begun to be used in interventional [[cardiology]] to help diagnose coronary artery disease,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bezerra|first=Hiram G.|author2=Costa, Marco A. |author3=Guagliumi, Giulio |author4=Rollins, Andrew M. |author5= Simon, Daniel I. |title=Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography: A Comprehensive Review|journal=JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions|date=November 2009|volume=2|issue=11|pages=1035\u20131046|doi=10.1016/j.jcin.2009.06.019|pmid=19926041|pmc=4113036}}</ref> and in [[dermatology]] to improve diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chua|first1=Shunjie|title=High-Definition Optical Coherence Tomography for the Study of Evolution of a Disease|journal=Dermatology Bulletin|date=2015|volume=26|issue=1|pages=2\u20133|url=https://www.nsc.com.sg/Professional-Education/Documents/NSC-Bulletin-PDF/NSC%20Derm%20Bulletin%20Vol%2026%20Num_1%20Jan%202015.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2015}}</ref> A relatively recent implementation of optical coherence tomography, [[frequency-domain]] optical coherence tomography, provides advantages in the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] provided, thus permitting faster signal acquisition.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Introduction==\n[[File:HautFingerspitzeOCT.gif|thumb|300px|Optical coherence tomogram of a fingertip.

In OCT, this interference is shortened to a distance of micrometers, owing to the use of broad-bandwidth light sources (i.e., sources that emit light over a broad range of frequencies). Light with broad bandwidths can be generated by using superluminescent diodes or lasers with extremely short pulses ([[femtosecond laser]]s). White light is an example of a broadband source with lower power.\n\nLight in an OCT system is broken into two arms\u2014a sample arm (containing the item of interest) and a reference arm (usually a mirror). The combination of reflected light from the sample arm and reference light from the reference arm gives rise to an interference pattern, but only if light from both arms have traveled the \"same\" optical distance (\"same\" meaning a difference of less than a coherence length). By scanning the mirror in the reference arm, a reflectivity profile of the sample can be obtained (this is time domain OCT). Areas of the sample that reflect back a lot of light will create greater interference than areas that don't. Any light that is outside the short coherence length will not interfere.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Optical Coherence Tomography: An Emerging Technology for Biomedical Imaging and Optical Biopsy |year=2000|last1= Fujimoto |first1= JG| last2= Pitris |first2= C.| last3= Boppart |first3= SA| last4= Brezinski |first4= ME|journal= Neoplasia |volume=2|issue=1\u20132|pages=9\u201325|pmc= 1531864 | doi=10.1038/sj.neo.7900071 | pmid=10933065}}</ref> This reflectivity profile, called an [[A-scan]], contains information about the spatial dimensions and location of structures within the item of interest.

An optical beam is directed at the tissue, and a small portion of this light that reflects from sub-surface features is collected. Note that most light is not reflected but, rather, scatters off at large angles. In conventional imaging, this diffusely scattered light contributes background that obscures an image. However, in OCT, a technique called interferometry is used to record the optical path length of received photons allowing rejection of most photons that scatter multiple times before detection. Thus OCT can build up clear 3D images of thick samples by rejecting background signal while collecting light directly reflected from surfaces of interest.\n\nWithin the range of noninvasive three-dimensional imaging techniques that have been introduced to the medical research community, OCT as an echo technique is similar to [[ultrasound imaging]]. Other medical imaging techniques such as computerized axial tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography do not use the echo-location principle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mastereyeassociates.com/optical-coherence-tomography-scan |title=Optical Coherence Tomography provides better resolution than an MRI and Helps Diagnose Retina & Corneal Disease and Glaucoma, Part II |last=Unknown |first=Unknown |publisher=mastereyeassociates |date=June 13, 2017 |website=mastereyeassociates.com |access-date=June 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe technique is limited to imaging 1 to 2&nbsp;mm below the surface in biological tissue, because at greater depths the proportion of light that escapes without scattering is too small to be detected. No special preparation of a biological specimen is required, and images can be obtained \u2018non-contact\u2019 or through a transparent window or membrane. It is also important to note that the laser output from the instruments is low \u2013 eye-safe near-infrared light is used \u2013 and no damage to the sample is therefore likely.\n\n==Theory==\nThe principle of OCT is white light, or low coherence, interferometry. The optical setup typically consists of an interferometer (Fig. 1, typically [[Michelson interferometer|Michelson]] type) with a low coherence, broad bandwidth light source. Light is split into and recombined from reference and sample arm, respectively.\n\n{|\n[[File:OCT B-Scan Setup.GIF|thumb|375px|Fig. 2 Typical optical setup of single point OCT.

A property of low coherence interferometry is that interference, i.e. the series of dark and bright fringes, is only achieved when the path difference lies within the coherence length of the light source. This interference is called auto correlation in a symmetric interferometer (both arms have the same reflectivity), or cross-correlation in the common case. The envelope of this modulation changes as pathlength difference is varied, where the peak of the envelope corresponds to pathlength matching.\n\nThe interference of two partially coherent light beams can be expressed in terms of the source intensity, <math>I_S</math>, as\n\n:<math> I = k_1 I_S + k_2 I_S + 2 \\sqrt { \\left ( k_1 I_S \\right ) \\cdot \\left ( k_2 I_S \\right )} \\cdot Re \\left [\\gamma \\left ( \\tau \\right ) \\right] \\qquad (1) </math>\n\nwhere <math>k_1 + k_2 < 1</math> represents the interferometer beam splitting ratio, and <math> \\gamma ( \\tau ) </math> is called the complex degree of coherence, i.e. the interference envelope and carrier dependent on reference arm scan or time delay <math> \\tau </math>, and whose recovery is of interest in OCT.

In equation (2), the Gaussian envelope is amplitude modulated by an optical carrier. The peak of this envelope represents the location of the microstructure of the sample under test, with an amplitude dependent on the reflectivity of the surface. The optical carrier is due to the [[Doppler effect]] resulting from scanning one arm of the interferometer, and the frequency of this modulation is controlled by the speed of scanning. Therefore, translating one arm of the interferometer has two functions; depth scanning and a Doppler-shifted optical carrier are accomplished by pathlength variation. In OCT, the Doppler-shifted optical carrier has a frequency expressed as\n\n:<math> f_{Dopp} = \\frac { 2 \\cdot \\nu_0 \\cdot v_s } { c } \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\quad (3) </math>\n\nwhere <math> \\nu_0 </math> is the central optical frequency of the source, <math> v_s </math> is the scanning velocity of the pathlength variation, and <math> c </math> is the speed of light.\n\n[[File:Principle-TD-FD OCT.svg|thumb|450px|interference signals in TD vs. FD-OCT]]\nThe axial and lateral resolutions of OCT are decoupled from one another; the former being an equivalent to the coherence length of the light source and the latter being a function of the optics.

Two common approaches are swept-source and spectral-domain OCT. A swept source OCT encodes the optical frequency in time with a spectrally scanning source. A spectral domain OCT uses a dispersive detector, like a grating and a linear detector array, to separate the different wavelengths. Due to the [[Fourier analysis|Fourier]] relation ([[Wiener-Khintchine theorem]] between the auto correlation and the spectral power density) the depth scan can be immediately calculated by a Fourier-transform from the acquired spectra, without movement of the reference arm.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/2944.796348|title=Optical coherence tomography (OCT): a review|year=1999|last1=Schmitt|first1=J.M.|journal=IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics|volume=5|pages=1205\u20131215|issue=4|bibcode=1999IJSTQ...5.1205S|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f49830744c352507c8728d63384acc22dd3db0b1}}</ref><ref name=\"Fercher2\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0030-4018(95)00119-S|title=Measurement of intraocular distances by backscattering spectral interferometry|year=1995|last1=Fercher|first1=A|last2=Hitzenberger|first2=C.K.|last3=Kamp|first3=G.|last4=El-Zaiat|first4=S.Y.|journal=Optics Communications|volume=117|issue=1\u20132|pages=43\u201348|bibcode= 1995OptCo.117...43F }}</ref> This feature improves imaging speed dramatically, while the reduced losses during a single scan improve the signal to noise ratio proportional to the number of detection elements.

Thereby the information of the full depth scan can be acquired within a single exposure. However, the large signal to noise advantage of FD-OCT is reduced due to the lower dynamic range of stripe detectors with respect to single photosensitive diodes, resulting in an SNR ([[signal to noise ratio]]) advantage of ~10 [[decibel|dB]] at much higher speeds. This is not much of a problem when working at 1300&nbsp;nm, however, since dynamic range is not a serious problem at this wavelength range.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe drawbacks of this technology are found in a strong fall-off of the SNR, which is proportional to the distance from the zero delay and a sinc-type reduction of the depth dependent sensitivity because of limited detection linewidth. (One pixel detects a quasi-rectangular portion of an optical frequency range instead of a single frequency, the Fourier-transform leads to the sinc(z) behavior). Additionally the dispersive elements in the spectroscopic detector usually do not distribute the light equally spaced in frequency on the detector, but mostly have an inverse dependence. Therefore, the signal has to be resampled before processing, which can not take care of the difference in local (pixelwise) bandwidth, which results in further reduction of the signal quality. However, the fall-off is not a serious problem with the development of new generation CCD or photodiode array with a larger number of pixels.\n\n[[Optical heterodyne detection|Synthetic array heterodyne detection]] offers another approach to this problem without the need for high dispersion.\n\n====Time encoded====\nTime encoded frequency domain OCT (TEFD-OCT, or swept source OCT) tries to combine some of the advantages of standard TD and SEFD-OCT. Here the spectral components are not encoded by spatial separation, but they are encoded in time. The spectrum is either filtered or generated in single successive frequency steps and reconstructed before Fourier-transformation. By accommodation of a frequency scanning light source (i.e. frequency scanning laser) the optical setup (see Fig. 3) becomes simpler than SEFD, but the problem of scanning is essentially translated from the TD-OCT reference-arm into the TEFD-OCT light source.\nHere the advantage lies in the proven high SNR detection technology, while swept laser sources achieve very small instantaneous bandwidths (linewidths) at very high frequencies (20\u2013200&nbsp;kHz). Drawbacks are the nonlinearities in the wavelength (especially at high scanning frequencies), the broadening of the linewidth at high frequencies and a high sensitivity to movements of the scanning geometry or the sample (below the range of nanometers within successive frequency steps).\n\n===Full-field OCT===\n[[File:Full-field OCT.png|thumb|350px|Schematic view of a full-field OCT]]\n\nAn imaging approach to temporal OCT was developed by Claude Boccara's team in 1998,<ref>{{cite journal|language=en |title= Full-field optical coherence microscopy  |year=1998|last1=Beaurepaire|first1= E. |last2= Boccara |first2= A.C. |journal= Optics Letters |volume=23|issue = 4 |pages=244\u2013246 |doi=10.1364/ol.23.000244|pmid= 18084473 |bibcode=1998OptL...23..244B}}</ref> with an acquisition of the images without beam scanning.

The focus is continuously adjusted during the scan of the sample depth, using a high numerical aperture (NA) microscope objective to image with high lateral resolution. By using a supercontinuum laser as a light source, a quasi-isotropic spatial resolution of ~ 1&nbsp;\u00b5m is achieved at a central wavelength of ~ 800&nbsp;nm. On the other hand, line illumination and detection, combined with the use of a high NA microscope objective, produce a confocal gate that prevents most scattered light that does not contribute to the signal from being detected by the camera.

It is used for [[medical imaging]] and industrial [[nondestructive testing]] (NDT). Optical coherence tomography is based on low-coherence [[interferometry]], typically employing [[near-infrared]] light. The use of relatively long [[wavelength]] light allows it to penetrate into the scattering medium. [[Confocal microscopy]], another optical technique, typically penetrates less deeply into the sample but with higher resolution.\n\nDepending on the properties of the light source ([[superluminescent diode]]s, [[ultrashort pulse laser|ultrashort pulsed lasers]], and [[supercontinuum]] lasers have been employed), optical coherence tomography has achieved sub-[[Micrometre|micrometer]] resolution (with very wide-spectrum sources emitting over a ~100&nbsp;nm wavelength range).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}{{verification needed|reason=confocal microscopy typically has a resolution of about 1 um and it is stated earlier that confocal microscopy has better resolution than OCT, so need to substantiate this claim|date=June 2015}}\n\nOptical coherence tomography is one of a class of [[optical tomography|optical tomographic]] techniques.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Commercially available optical coherence tomography systems are employed in diverse applications, including art conservation and diagnostic medicine, notably in [[ophthalmology]] and [[optometry]] where it can be used to obtain detailed images from within the retina.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Recently, it has also begun to be used in interventional [[cardiology]] to help diagnose coronary artery disease,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bezerra|first=Hiram G.|author2=Costa, Marco A. |author3=Guagliumi, Giulio |author4=Rollins, Andrew M. |author5= Simon, Daniel I. |title=Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography: A Comprehensive Review|journal=JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions|date=November 2009|volume=2|issue=11|pages=1035\u20131046|doi=10.1016/j.jcin.2009.06.019|pmid=19926041|pmc=4113036}}</ref> and in [[dermatology]] to improve diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chua|first1=Shunjie|title=High-Definition Optical Coherence Tomography for the Study of Evolution of a Disease|journal=Dermatology Bulletin|date=2015|volume=26|issue=1|pages=2\u20133|url=https://www.nsc.com.sg/Professional-Education/Documents/NSC-Bulletin-PDF/NSC%20Derm%20Bulletin%20Vol%2026%20Num_1%20Jan%202015.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2015}}</ref> A relatively recent implementation of optical coherence tomography, [[frequency-domain]] optical coherence tomography, provides advantages in the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] provided, thus permitting faster signal acquisition.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Introduction==\n[[File:HautFingerspitzeOCT.gif|thumb|300px|Optical coherence tomogram of a fingertip.

In OCT, this interference is shortened to a distance of micrometers, owing to the use of broad-bandwidth light sources (i.e., sources that emit light over a broad range of frequencies). Light with broad bandwidths can be generated by using superluminescent diodes or lasers with extremely short pulses ([[femtosecond laser]]s). White light is an example of a broadband source with lower power.\n\nLight in an OCT system is broken into two arms\u2014a sample arm (containing the item of interest) and a reference arm (usually a mirror). The combination of reflected light from the sample arm and reference light from the reference arm gives rise to an interference pattern, but only if light from both arms have traveled the \"same\" optical distance (\"same\" meaning a difference of less than a coherence length). By scanning the mirror in the reference arm, a reflectivity profile of the sample can be obtained (this is time domain OCT). Areas of the sample that reflect back a lot of light will create greater interference than areas that don't.

An optical beam is directed at the tissue, and a small portion of this light that reflects from sub-surface features is collected. Note that most light is not reflected but, rather, scatters off at large angles. In conventional imaging, this diffusely scattered light contributes background that obscures an image. However, in OCT, a technique called interferometry is used to record the optical path length of received photons allowing rejection of most photons that scatter multiple times before detection. Thus OCT can build up clear 3D images of thick samples by rejecting background signal while collecting light directly reflected from surfaces of interest.\n\nWithin the range of noninvasive three-dimensional imaging techniques that have been introduced to the medical research community, OCT as an echo technique is similar to [[ultrasound imaging]]. Other medical imaging techniques such as computerized axial tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography do not use the echo-location principle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mastereyeassociates.com/optical-coherence-tomography-scan |title=Optical Coherence Tomography provides better resolution than an MRI and Helps Diagnose Retina & Corneal Disease and Glaucoma, Part II |last=Unknown |first=Unknown |publisher=mastereyeassociates |date=June 13, 2017 |website=mastereyeassociates.com |access-date=June 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe technique is limited to imaging 1 to 2&nbsp;mm below the surface in biological tissue, because at greater depths the proportion of light that escapes without scattering is too small to be detected. No special preparation of a biological specimen is required, and images can be obtained \u2018non-contact\u2019 or through a transparent window or membrane. It is also important to note that the laser output from the instruments is low \u2013 eye-safe near-infrared light is used \u2013 and no damage to the sample is therefore likely.\n\n==Theory==\nThe principle of OCT is white light, or low coherence, interferometry. The optical setup typically consists of an interferometer (Fig. 1, typically [[Michelson interferometer|Michelson]] type) with a low coherence, broad bandwidth light source. Light is split into and recombined from reference and sample arm, respectively.\n\n{|\n[[File:OCT B-Scan Setup.GIF|thumb|375px|Fig. 2 Typical optical setup of single point OCT.

A property of low coherence interferometry is that interference, i.e. the series of dark and bright fringes, is only achieved when the path difference lies within the coherence length of the light source. This interference is called auto correlation in a symmetric interferometer (both arms have the same reflectivity), or cross-correlation in the common case. The envelope of this modulation changes as pathlength difference is varied, where the peak of the envelope corresponds to pathlength matching.\n\nThe interference of two partially coherent light beams can be expressed in terms of the source intensity, <math>I_S</math>, as\n\n:<math> I = k_1 I_S + k_2 I_S + 2 \\sqrt { \\left ( k_1 I_S \\right ) \\cdot \\left ( k_2 I_S \\right )} \\cdot Re \\left [\\gamma \\left ( \\tau \\right ) \\right] \\qquad (1) </math>\n\nwhere <math>k_1 + k_2 < 1</math> represents the interferometer beam splitting ratio, and <math> \\gamma ( \\tau ) </math> is called the complex degree of coherence, i.e. the interference envelope and carrier dependent on reference arm scan or time delay <math> \\tau </math>, and whose recovery is of interest in OCT.

In equation (2), the Gaussian envelope is amplitude modulated by an optical carrier. The peak of this envelope represents the location of the microstructure of the sample under test, with an amplitude dependent on the reflectivity of the surface. The optical carrier is due to the [[Doppler effect]] resulting from scanning one arm of the interferometer, and the frequency of this modulation is controlled by the speed of scanning. Therefore, translating one arm of the interferometer has two functions; depth scanning and a Doppler-shifted optical carrier are accomplished by pathlength variation. In OCT, the Doppler-shifted optical carrier has a frequency expressed as\n\n:<math> f_{Dopp} = \\frac { 2 \\cdot \\nu_0 \\cdot v_s } { c } \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\quad (3) </math>\n\nwhere <math> \\nu_0 </math> is the central optical frequency of the source, <math> v_s </math> is the scanning velocity of the pathlength variation, and <math> c </math> is the speed of light.\n\n[[File:Principle-TD-FD OCT.svg|thumb|450px|interference signals in TD vs. FD-OCT]]\nThe axial and lateral resolutions of OCT are decoupled from one another; the former being an equivalent to the coherence length of the light source and the latter being a function of the optics.

Two common approaches are swept-source and spectral-domain OCT. A swept source OCT encodes the optical frequency in time with a spectrally scanning source. A spectral domain OCT uses a dispersive detector, like a grating and a linear detector array, to separate the different wavelengths. Due to the [[Fourier analysis|Fourier]] relation ([[Wiener-Khintchine theorem]] between the auto correlation and the spectral power density) the depth scan can be immediately calculated by a Fourier-transform from the acquired spectra, without movement of the reference arm.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/2944.796348|title=Optical coherence tomography (OCT): a review|year=1999|last1=Schmitt|first1=J.M.|journal=IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics|volume=5|pages=1205\u20131215|issue=4|bibcode=1999IJSTQ...5.1205S|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f49830744c352507c8728d63384acc22dd3db0b1}}</ref><ref name=\"Fercher2\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0030-4018(95)00119-S|title=Measurement of intraocular distances by backscattering spectral interferometry|year=1995|last1=Fercher|first1=A|last2=Hitzenberger|first2=C.K.|last3=Kamp|first3=G.|last4=El-Zaiat|first4=S.Y.|journal=Optics Communications|volume=117|issue=1\u20132|pages=43\u201348|bibcode= 1995OptCo.117...43F }}</ref> This feature improves imaging speed dramatically, while the reduced losses during a single scan improve the signal to noise ratio proportional to the number of detection elements.

Thereby the information of the full depth scan can be acquired within a single exposure. However, the large signal to noise advantage of FD-OCT is reduced due to the lower dynamic range of stripe detectors with respect to single photosensitive diodes, resulting in an SNR ([[signal to noise ratio]]) advantage of ~10 [[decibel|dB]] at much higher speeds. This is not much of a problem when working at 1300&nbsp;nm, however, since dynamic range is not a serious problem at this wavelength range.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe drawbacks of this technology are found in a strong fall-off of the SNR, which is proportional to the distance from the zero delay and a sinc-type reduction of the depth dependent sensitivity because of limited detection linewidth. (One pixel detects a quasi-rectangular portion of an optical frequency range instead of a single frequency, the Fourier-transform leads to the sinc(z) behavior). Additionally the dispersive elements in the spectroscopic detector usually do not distribute the light equally spaced in frequency on the detector, but mostly have an inverse dependence. Therefore, the signal has to be resampled before processing, which can not take care of the difference in local (pixelwise) bandwidth, which results in further reduction of the signal quality. However, the fall-off is not a serious problem with the development of new generation CCD or photodiode array with a larger number of pixels.\n\n[[Optical heterodyne detection|Synthetic array heterodyne detection]] offers another approach to this problem without the need for high dispersion.\n\n====Time encoded====\nTime encoded frequency domain OCT (TEFD-OCT, or swept source OCT) tries to combine some of the advantages of standard TD and SEFD-OCT. Here the spectral components are not encoded by spatial separation, but they are encoded in time. The spectrum is either filtered or generated in single successive frequency steps and reconstructed before Fourier-transformation. By accommodation of a frequency scanning light source (i.e. frequency scanning laser) the optical setup (see Fig. 3) becomes simpler than SEFD, but the problem of scanning is essentially translated from the TD-OCT reference-arm into the TEFD-OCT light source.\nHere the advantage lies in the proven high SNR detection technology, while swept laser sources achieve very small instantaneous bandwidths (linewidths) at very high frequencies (20\u2013200&nbsp;kHz). Drawbacks are the nonlinearities in the wavelength (especially at high scanning frequencies), the broadening of the linewidth at high frequencies and a high sensitivity to movements of the scanning geometry or the sample (below the range of nanometers within successive frequency steps).\n\n===Full-field OCT===\n[[File:Full-field OCT.png|thumb|350px|Schematic view of a full-field OCT]]\n\nAn imaging approach to temporal OCT was developed by Claude Boccara's team in 1998,<ref>{{cite journal|language=en |title= Full-field optical coherence microscopy  |year=1998|last1=Beaurepaire|first1= E. |last2= Boccara |first2= A.C. |journal= Optics Letters |volume=23|issue = 4 |pages=244\u2013246 |doi=10.1364/ol.23.000244|pmid= 18084473 |bibcode=1998OptL...23..244B}}</ref> with an acquisition of the images without beam scanning.

On July 24, 2004, Rodriguez was hit by a pitch from [[Bronson Arroyo]], which led to a scuffle with [[Boston Red Sox]] catcher [[Jason Varitek]], and a bench-clearing brawl between both teams. On defense, he had the lowest range factor among non-[[platoon system|platoon]] AL third basemen (2.39) in his first year at the position.<ref>{{cite web|title=MLB Player Fielding Stats \u2013 As 3b \u2013 2004|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/fielding/_/year/2004/position/3b/league/al/sort/rangeFactor/order/true|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=May 30, 2010}}</ref> He finished 14th in balloting for the AL MVP Award.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_2004.shtml|title=2004 Awards Voting|website=Baseball-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2004 [[American League Division Series|ALDS]], Rodriguez was a dominant hitter against the [[Minnesota Twins]], batting .421 and slugging .737 while delivering two key extra-inning hits. Following the series win, Rodriguez's first season with the Yankees culminated in a dramatic playoff series against the team he had almost ended up playing for: the Yankees' bitter [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry|rival]], the [[Boston Red Sox]]. In that series (ALCS) he equaled the single-game post-season record with five runs scored in Game 3 at Boston.\n\nOne of the most controversial plays of Rodriguez's career occurred late in Game 6 of the [[2004 American League Championship Series]]. With one out and [[Derek Jeter]] on first base in the bottom of the eighth inning, Rodriguez hit a slow roller between the pitcher's mound and the first base line. Red Sox [[pitcher]] [[Bronson Arroyo]] fielded the ball and ran towards Rodriguez to apply a tag. As Arroyo reached towards him, Rodriguez swatted at his glove, knocking the ball loose. As the ball rolled away, Jeter scored all the way from first as Rodriguez took second on the play, which was initially ruled an error on Arroyo. However, the umpires quickly huddled, then ruled that Rodriguez was out for interference. Jeter was sent back to first base, and his run was nullified.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/features/thestadium/the_greatest/notsogreat-a-rod-slap-play.html |title=Greatest Moments at Yankee Stadium \u2013 NY Daily News |work=Daily News |date=October 19, 2004 |accessdate=August 4, 2010 |location=New York |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723142910/http://www.nydailynews.com/features/thestadium/the_greatest/notsogreat-a-rod-slap-play.html |archivedate=July 23, 2010 }}</ref> The Yankees would then lose the ALCS to the eventual [[2004 World Series|World Series]] champion Red Sox after leading the series 3 games to none.\n\n====2005\u20132006====\nIn 2005, Rodriguez hit .321, leading the American League with 124 runs and 48 HR while driving in 130 runs.<ref name=\"b-r\" /> He became the first Yankee to win the American League home run title since [[Reggie Jackson]] (41) in 1980.

His combination of power, speed, and defense made him a cornerstone of the franchise, but he left the team via free agency after the 2000 season to join the Rangers. The 10-year, $252 million contract he signed was the richest in baseball history at the time.  He played at a high level in his three years with Texas, highlighted by his first AL MVP Award win in 2003, but the team failed to make the playoffs during his tenure. Prior to the 2004 season, Rodriguez was traded to the Yankees, for whom he converted to a third baseman, because [[Derek Jeter]] was already the Yankees' full-time shortstop. During Rodriguez's career with the Yankees, he was named AL MVP in 2005 and 2007.
