{"title_page": "Civil Code of Argentina", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2015}}\n[[Image:Edificio del Congreso en Buenos Aires 2004.JPG|thumb|250px|Congress building in Buenos Aires, Argentina]]\n\nThe '''Civil Code of Argentina''' was the [[civil code|legal code]] in force between 1871 and 2015,\nwhich formed the foundation of the [[Legal systems of the world|system]] of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in [[Argentina]]. It was written by [[Dalmacio V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield]], as the culmination of a series of attempts to codify civil law in Argentina. The original code was approved on September 25, 1869, by the passage of [[s:es:Ley 340 Sanci\u00f3n del C\u00f3digo Civil de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina|Law 340]], and became active on January 1, 1871. With numerous subsequent modifications, it continued to be the foundation of Argentine civil law (''Derecho civil argentino'') for more than a century. On 1 August 2015, the Civil Code of Argentina was replaced by a new Civil and Commercial Code - ''C\u00f3digo Civil y Comercial de la Naci\u00f3n''.<ref>http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/235000-239999/235975/norma.htm</ref><ref>http://jornadaonline.com/Pol%C3%ADtica/139234-Comienza-a-regir-el-nuevo-C%C3%B3digo-Civil-y-Comercial</ref>\n\nV\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield's code reflects the influence of the [[Civil law (legal system)|continental law]] and liberal principles of the 17th century. It was also influenced by the great [[Napoleonic code]], the Spanish laws in effect at that time in Argentina, [[Roman law]] (especially through the work of [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Savigny]]), [[canon law]], the draft of the Brazilian civil code (''Esbo\u00e7o de um C\u00f3digo Civil para Brasil'') by [[Augusto Teixeira de Freitas|Freitas]], and the influence of the [[Chilean Civil Code]] (by [[Andr\u00e9s Bello]]).\n\nApproval of the Argentine civil code was necessary for judicial reasons and political reasons. It gave a new coherence and unity to civil law. The civil code's authority over provincial law improved the inconsistent existing legislation throughout the country at the time. This unity and coherence would bring two important benefits: it would facilitate both the people's knowledge about the law, as well as its application by judges, the legislation would also strengthen the political independence of the country, through legislative independence and national unity.\n\nIn spite of the stability brought by the civil code to the Argentine law system, it was subject to various modifications throughout its history, as was necessary to adequately regulate a society undergoing significant social, political and economical changes. The most important reform was Law 17.711 of April 22, 1968. Not only did the law change around 5% of the complete article, it is especially important due to the change in orientation regarding some regulated institutions. There were also other reform projects that were not implemented. Along with proposals to change institutions and methods, one of them proposed to merge the civil code with the ''commercial code'', following the example of the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian code]].\n\nAfter decades of deliberations, a new ''C\u00f3digo Civil y Comercial de la Naci\u00f3n'' was approved in 2014, and entered into force in 2015, replacing the old code.<ref>http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/235000-239999/235975/norma.htm</ref><ref>http://jornadaonline.com/Pol%C3%ADtica/139234-Comienza-a-regir-el-nuevo-C%C3%B3digo-Civil-y-Comercial</ref>\n\n== Precursors ==\n[[Image:JustoJoseUrquiza.jpg|thumb|right|During the [[Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza]] administration many projects were driven forward.]]\nThe codification in Argentina was part of a process being undertaken around the world, due to the advantages that such a systematic approach granted. Indeed, there had been earlier codifications; those completed toward the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century had a strong influence on the compilation of the Civil Code of Argentina. Stemming from these, there were separate attempts at civil codification in the Argentine republic during the first half of the 19th century, but it was finally achieved in 1869.\n\nThe unification of the country and its political growth and strengthening demanded the codification of the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil laws]], since it was not possible to continue under the uncertainty caused by the inadequate code that existed under the rule of the Spanish.\n\nBefore the Civil Code, there had been several attempts to this effect, without success. In 1824, [[Juan Gregorio de las Heras]] issued a decree appointing one commission charged with compiling the Commercial Code and another charged with compiling the Military Code, but neither of these two projects' efforts came to fruition. In 1831, the Legislature of [[Buenos Aires]] adopted the Spanish Commercial Code compiled in 1829 and created a commission to see to any reforms to it that might be necessary. In 1852, [[Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza]] created a commission of 14 members for the compilation of the Civil, Penal, Commercial and Procedural Codes. However, the revolution of September 11 of that year, which resulted in the secession of the [[Provincia de Buenos Aires|Province of Buenos Aires]] from the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Argentina|Argentine Confederacy]], prevented this project from making any concrete progress.\n\nThe [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]], in clause 11 of article 67, authorized the [[Congreso de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina|Argentine National Congress]] to draw up the Civil, Commercial, Penal and Mining Codes. With the intent of fulfilling this constitutional mandate, [[Facundo Zuvir\u00eda]] brought before the [[Senado de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina|Senate]] a law that would empower the Executive Branch to appoint a commission to complete those tasks. The law was passed and signed by Urquiza, but for financial reasons the initiative was postponed.\n\nIn the State of Buenos Aires, an initiative to launch a Civil Code suffered the same fate. On October 17, 1857, a law was passed that authorized the Executive Branch to spend the necessary funds to compile the Civil, Criminal and Procedural Codes, but the initiative was ultimately frustrated.<ref>Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa (1952). ps. 60 y ss.</ref> However, the Commercial Code had better luck. The task of compiling that code had been given to [[Dalmacio V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield]] and [[Eduardo Acevedo Maturana]], who sent it to the legislature for its approval. The Commercial Code of the State of Buenos Aires was finally passed in 1859, and it was this code that was adopted at the national level in 1862 and amended in 1889.\n\n=== Legislation in force prior to its sanction ===\n[[Image:Partidas.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Front page of the [[Siete Partidas]].]]\nUntil the sanction of the Code, the Argentine legislation was based on the Spanish legislation previous to the [[May Revolution]], and on the one called ''Legislaci\u00f3n Patria'' (Native Legislation).\n\nThe Spanish legislation in use in the country was the New Compilation of 1567, since the [[Newest Compilation]] of 1805 did not have application before the revolution. The New Compilation contained laws coming from the ''[[Fuero Real]]'' (Royal Jurisdiction), the ''[[Ordenamiento de Alcal\u00e1]]'' (the Code Law Reordering of Alcal\u00e1), the Reordering of Montalvo and the Laws of [[Toro, Spain|Toro]]. In order of importance: \n*1st New Compilation, \n*2nd Fuero Real, \n*3rd [[Fuero Juzgo]], \n*4th Fuero viejo de Castilla (Old Fuero of Castile), \n*5th the [[Partidas]]. \nNevertheless, the ''Siete Partidas'' (Seven-Part Codes) were more often applied due to their prestige, the extension of the addressed matters, and the further knowledge of them by judges and lawyers.\n\nThe ''Legislaci\u00f3n Patria'' was composed of the laws sanctioned by the provincial and national governments. These laws were of considerably less importance compared to the Spanish legislation and weren't altered, confirming the principle according to which the political [[emancipation]] lets endure the previous private Law until the new State arranges otherwise, in exercise of its sovereignty.<ref>Cabral Texo (1920). p. 1.</ref>\n\nThe primary national laws were the [[liberty of wombs]] (''Libertad de Vientres'') and of the slaves entering the territory (1813), the suppression of entailed states (''[[mayorazgo]]'') (1813) and of [[emphyteusis]] (1826), and the suppression of gentilic retract (1868), that gave the right to re-acquire family real estate sold to a stranger to the nearest relative of the original vendor (up to the 4th grade of kinship).\n\nOther various laws and provincial decrees modifying different institutions existed, as the emancipation by age rating (dictated by [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]] on November 17, 1824, by [[Tucum\u00e1n Province|Tucum\u00e1n]] on September 1, 1860 and by [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre R\u00edos]] on March 10, 1866); the determination of [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] in the main estate (dictated by Buenos Aires on September 16, 1859), about books of births, matrimonies and deaths, being the parish priests in charge (dictated by Buenos Aires on December 19, 1821, by [[provincia de Jujuy|Jujuy]] on September 7, 1836 and by [[provincia de Santa Fe|Santa Fe]] on May 17, 1862); about restrictions and limits to the domains (dictated by Buenos Aires on July 27, 1865, by Jujuy in February 1855 and March 7, 1857, and by [[provincia de C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]] on August 27, 1868); and of the renting of fields (dictated by Santa Fe on July 31, 1837).\n\n== Sanction ==\n[[Image:Velez Sarsfield.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dalmacio V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield]], editor of the Civil Code]]\nArgentina had been attempting without success to join the codifying movement in vogue at that time in some of the world's most powerful nations. The creation of the code would bring several advantages to the legislation that was at that time characterized by its dispersion, and consequently, its difficult implementation. The new system would provide mainly a unity and coherence to the civil legislation, and thus it would help it to be known and applied.\n\nThere were also reasons of judicial nationalism that were motives for its creation, since it was considered necessary to reaffirm the political independence obtained decades before through legislative independence. The legislation most influential on Argentine law was until then the Spanish legislation, sanctioned centuries before, primarily because national law had minimal influence on [[private law]].\n\nFinally, the sanction of a code was hoped to become an efficient instrument for the consolidation of the national unity that had been expensively obtained only a few years earlier. The unification could have been damaged if the [[provinces of Argentina|provinces]] had kept their own laws, or had independently sanctioned new ones to fix the inadequacies in the Spanish one instead of doing it in an unified way.\n\nOn June 6, 1863 Law No. 36, sponsored by deputy Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral from [[Corrientes Province]], was passed, which empowered the [[executive power|executive branch]] to appoint commissions in charge of writing the projects for the Civil, Penal, and Mining Codes and Military Ordinances.\n\nEven though the law allowed for the creation of commissions of several persons, president [[Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre]] decided to put a single person in charge, [[Dalmacio V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield]], through a decree dated October 20, 1864.\n\n[[Image:Vdelaplaza.jpg|thumb|right|[[Victorino de la Plaza]], [[president of Argentina]], was one of V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield's assistants.]]\n\nV\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield redacted the Project for the Civil Code without collaborators other than assistants that would transcribe his drafts. Among them were [[Victorino de la Plaza]], who later would become president, Eduardo D\u00edaz de Vivar and V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield's daughter Aurelia. For the task, V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield withdrew to a country house he owned, located a few kilometers from [[Buenos Aires]] city, where he wrote the drafts that his assistants transcribed. The final transcript was delivered to the government for its printing, and was later destroyed. The drafts can currently be found at the [[Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba]].\n\nAs V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield moved forward with his work, he would send it to the executive branch, which would then print and distribute it among the legislators, magistrates, lawyers and \"competent persons, to allow them to study the work now and build an opinion of it for the time of its ratification\".<ref>Decree dated June 23, 1865. Cabral Texo (1920). ps. 130.</ref> V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield finished Book I in 1865, the first two sections of Book II in 1866, the third section of that book at the beginning of 1867, Book III in 1868, and Book IV in 1869, finishing the code after 4 years and 2 months of work.\n\nThe project completed, President [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] sent a note to the Congress on August 25, 1869 proposing the law that would ratify the project of the Civil Code. In the message, Sarmiento recommended immediate implementation, \"entrusting its reform to the passage of future laws that will be enacted as experience dictates their necessity\".<ref>Cabral Texo (1920), pp. 130ss</ref>\n\nThe Chamber of Deputies approved the project on September 22, 1869 after rejecting various alternate version and objections to its being passed without amendment. The chamber determined that it would become effective on January 1, 1871. It then passed to the Senate, which ratified it on September 25, and it was promulgated by Sarmiento on September 29.\n\nThe Project was closed-book endorsed, that is it was accepted without changes to the original, which according to Llamb\u00edas did not require any debate:\n\n{{quote|Parliamentary bodies, due to their composition and functioning, lack the capacity to undertake the study and analytical debate related to a scientific task of such a delicate systematic nature as a Code. It can only be expected that such debate will become inorganic and endless, and that in the case of the passage of proposed amendments the coherence of the general system will be ruined, through the failure to recognize that the main advantage of codifying efforts resides in the methodizing of the law, which allows the maximum usefulness to be obtained from it later.|Llamb\u00edas (2003). ps. 171 and ss.}}\n<!-- \nrepeated text, see top of section\n\nLa sanci\u00f3n del C\u00f3digo Civil supuso un gran avance respecto al r\u00e9gimen legal anterior, que se caracterizaba por su dispersi\u00f3n y falta de cohesi\u00f3n, y su consiguiente dif\u00edcil conocimiento y aplicaci\u00f3n.\n-->\n\nThe endorsement of the Civil Code represented a great improvement over the previous legal regime, and fused modern advances in doctrine with local customs and active law.\n\n== Sources of the Civil Code ==\nIn his work on the Code, [[Dalmacio V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield]] was inspired by contemporary and older codes, by national and international law, and to a large extent by the prevailing doctrines of the period. These sources can be classified as follows: [[Roman law]], Spanish and Argentine law, [[canon law]], the [[Napoleonic Code]] and its commentaries, the work of Freitas, and various other minor sources.\n\n=== Roman law ===\nRoman law was not a direct influence on the civil code in the sense that none of its dispositions were directly extracted from the [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]] or from any Roman jurist's passage. Nevertheless, V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield returned to the Roman criteria in some institutions' regulations, even those that hadn't been addressed by the contemporary codification. That was the case of [[property]] transmitted by \"tradition\", as opposed to the French code, which had changed it to transmission by \"consentment\". Moreover, among the notes of the codifier there are quotes of those laws, but they are second-hand references.\n\nThe indirect Roman influence is reflected in the most part in the doctrines used by the author, especially as regards patrimonial structures. The main influence on the work of V\u00e9lez Sarsfield was the German Romanist [[Friedrich Karl von Savigny]] with his work \"System of the present Roman law\" (''System des heutigen r\u00f6mischen Rechts''), used especially referring to [[Juristic person|legal entities]], obligations, property and possession, and the adoption of the [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] principle as a determining element of the law, applicable to the people's marital status and [[Capacity (law)|capacity]].\n\n=== Spanish and native legislation ===\nOnce he finished the gathering process, V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield was criticized for ignoring the Spanish legislation, which by the time was the one in effect in Argentina. One of these critics was [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], who was refuted by the modernizing critic and by V\u00e9lez himself:\n{{quote|\"Had Dr. Alberdi gone at least lightly through my project, he would have found that the first source I make use of at the laws that rule us. The biggest number of articles have a note on the law of [[Siete Partidas|Partidas]], of the Royal Forum, of the recopilated ones. \"|Cabral Texo, Jorge. \"Juicios cr\u00edticos sobre el C\u00f3digo Civil argentino\", p. 249.}}\n\nThe influence of this legislation regarding its method and technique was practically null, what can be understood due to the dispersion that characterized it. Nevertheless, on the material, and the sense and reach of the dispositions, V\u00e9lez did make use of the old Right, adopting it to the new needs.\n\nThe national legislation had little relevance on private law, though it did partially influence on the work of the Coder. Such is the case of the hereditary vocation of the article 3,572, whose antecedent is the law dictated by the legislature of the [[Buenos Aires Province]] dictated on May 22, 1857. V\u00e9lez had also in mind the uses and customs of the country, especially regarding the family organisation.\n\n=== Canon law ===\n[[Canon law]] had a large influence over [[family law]], especially in the area of matrimony. V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield left matrimony under the jurisdiction of the [[Catholic Church]], taking the institution of canonical marriage and giving it civil effects. But the validity of matrimony was unchanged from the canonical version and the dispositions of the ecclesiastical courts, which would remain until the sanction of the law of civil matrimony. About this, V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield expressed:\n{{quote|\"Catholic people, such as the people of the Argentine Republic, would not be able to contract civil matrimony. For them it would be an endless concubinage, condemned by the religion and customs of the country. Any law that would authorize such matrimonies, in the present state of our society, would ignore the mission of the laws, which is to keep and strengthen the power of customs, not to weaken and corrupt them. It would give incentive to Catholic people to ignore the precepts of their religion, without a beneficial result for individuals or families.<br/>\nFor those who do not profess the Catholic religion, a law that gives marriage a religious characteristic does not attack in any sense the freedom of cult, for the law doesn't force anyone to renounce their beliefs. Each one can invoke God from the altar of one's own cult.\" .\"|Note on article 167, C\u00f3digo Civil Argentino}}\nThis resolution by V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield is explained by the uses and customs of that time, as it shows the sanction of a law of civil matrimony by the legislature of the [[Santa Fe Province]] in 1867: the law produced a popular reaction that ended with the resignation of the governor and the dissolution of the legislature house, which annulled the law when it was reconstituted.\n\n=== Napoleon's Code ===\nThe influence of this code in the Coder movement proved very important, and the Civil Code of Argentina did not escape from this influence, being in a direct way or through his commentators.\n\nThe direct influence can be shown in the 145 articles copied from the French code.<ref>Segovia (1933). T. 1, ''Introduction''</ref> But the main direct influence of the commentators is that of the treta of [[Charles Aubry]] and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Charles Rau, specially the third edition published in Paris between 1856 and 1858, of which the Coder took several passages that he used in around 700 articles.<ref>Segovia (1933). T. 1, ''Introduction'', p. XX</ref> The work of [[Raymond Troplong]] provided the material for 50 articles related to the testament inheritance, and others for the real rights. From [[Jean Demolombe]] he took 52 articles for book IV and 9 for book III, from Chabot he used 18 articles for book IV, and from Zachariae 70 articles.<ref>Segovia (1933). ''loc. cit.''</ref>\n\n=== Freitas's work ===\nThe influence of Brazilian lawyer [[Augusto Teixeira de Freitas]] came from two of his works: the \"Consolidation of the civil laws\" (''Consolida\u00e7\u00e3o das Leis Civis'') and his \"Draft of a civil code for Brazil\" (''Esbo\u00e7o de um C\u00f3digo Civil pra Brasil'').\n\nThe \u2018\u2019Consolidation of the civil laws\u2019\u2019 sorts in 1,333 articles the material of the Portuguese legislation, that contained the same dispersion present in the Spanish legislation in use in the Americas. His \"Draft\" was commended to him by the [[Empire of Brazil]] in 1859, but remained unfinished after completion of article 4,908, without reaching the inheritance section. In spite of this, it was one of the most frequently consulted works by V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield; the first three books of the Argentine Civil Code contain more than 1,200 articles from the ''Draft''.\n\n=== Other sources ===\nV\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield also used a number of different Codes and doctrine works that had a secondary influence in the Argentine Civil Code.\n\nAfter the [[Napoleonic code|French Code]], the most influential code was the [[Chilean Civil Code]],<ref>http://www.bcn.cl/leyes/pdf/actualizado/172986.pdf</ref> promulgated on 1855 and written by lawman [[Andr\u00e9s Bello]]. That code was highly valuated by the Argentine Coder, and it is estimated that he based on it for the formulation of 170 articles of the Argentine code.\n\nHe also made use of the Code of [[Louisiana]], in which he based for the creation of 52 articles, of the [[Albertine Code]] for the Sardonic States, of the legislative Russian consolidation, the Code of Parma, the Code of [[Two Sicilies]], the General [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] Code of 1874, the Austrian Code of 1811, the Code of [[New York State]] and the Italian Code of 1865.\n\nV\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield made also use of the 1851 project for the [[Spanish Civil Code]] prepared by [[Florencio Garc\u00eda Goyena]]. That project held 3,000 articles, and it's calculated that it helped in the formulation of 300 articles of the Argentine Code.<ref>Segovia (1933). ''Introduction'', p. XIX.</ref>\n\nFinally, V\u00e9lez used 27 articles from the 1851 project for the Uruguayan Civil Code by [[Eduardo Acevedo Maturana]], as well as some references for his notes.\n\n== Structure ==\nMethod is of crucial importance in a codification work, due its systematic nature, and to the vastness of the subject. Hence it is important to regard and direct man's behavior through general and specific formulae that find their appropriate place among the assembled articles.\n\nV\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield dedicated much effort to the selection of an adequate method, and after receiving objections to the use of the methods of [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s ''Institutiones'' and of the [[Napoleonic code|French civil code]], he decided to use the one followed by Freitas in his ''Consolida\u00e7ao das Leis Civis'', which finds its origins in the teachings of [[Friedrich Karl von Savigny]].\n\nAccording to Freitas's ideas, it is convenient to commence a Code Law by the general dispositions, then address the ones referred to the subject of every legal relation (\"[[Person|the theory of persons]]\"). But, as men don't live isolated but in their family's bosom, it must be continued with the [[Family law]]. Then the individual enters the civil life and establishes links person-to-person: the \"[[Law of obligations|obligations]]\", or person-to-the-things submitted to him: the \"[[real property]]\". Finally it must be legislated about the theory of [[Estate (law)|estate]], with the \"[[Order of succession|successions]]\" and the \"theory of privileges\". To end, the institution of [[Statute of limitations|prescriptions]], that, as referring to the rights as a whole, it was considered appropriate to locate it in a section inside the common dispositions to the real and personal rights.\n\nThus, the Civil Code organisation is the following:\n*'''Preliminary titles:''' the Civil Code begins with two preliminary titles. The first title deals with the laws and elaborated a \"general theory of the law\". The second refers to the way of counting the intervals in law.\n*'''Book I:''' This book is dedicated to the people. Its first section \"Of the people in general\", deals with the persons themselves, and the second, \"On personal rights in family relationships\", with the family.\n*'''Book II:''' This book is divided into three sections. The first deals with the obligations in general and their limits. The second, talks about the judicial acts and doings that produced the acquisition, modification, transfer and lose of the rights and obligations. Finally, the third deals with obligations from contracts.\n*'''Book III:''' This book talks about real rights, dealing with things themselves, or in relation with the persons.\n*'''Book IV:''' This book contains a preliminary title about the transmission of rights in general. It then has three sections: the first about successions ''[[mortis causa]]'', the second about privileges and right of keeping, and the third about [[custom (law)|prescription]].\n\n=== Fundamental principles ===\nThe compilation of the Civil Code was organized around a set of fundamental principles, which were based on ideas in vogue at the time of its compilation:\n*Sovereign will principle: The terms specified in contracts should be respected as if they were law, insofar as the exercise of a right would not constitute an illicit act. However, jurisprudence has established restrictions on this principle, as specified by Article 953, in the so-called \"moral clause\": \"''The object of legal compacts should be acts that are not contrary to respected custom.''\"\n*Responsibility based on fault: [[responsabilidad civil|Civil responsibility]] was grounded in the idea of [[Culpability|fault]]. Article 1067 establishes that no punishable illicit act exists where there has been no harm caused, or exterior action that could cause harm, and without the ability to impute [[Mens rea]], fault or negligence to the actor.\n*Absolute right to property: The right of private property allows one to use, enjoy, and even destroy something owned, but there are certain limitations imposed on the reach of this right, and jurisprudence establishes restrictions, based on the aforementioned Article 953. The justification of the right to destroy property is established in the following note found in Article 2.513: \"''[...] But it must be recognized that with absolute right to property, comes the right to destroy property. Any preventive restriction would cause more harm than good. If the state acts as an arbiter of abuse, soon it will begin to act as arbiter of use, and any real notion of private property and liberty would be lost.''\"\n*Family grounded in indissoluble matrimony: [[Family law]] was grounded in the concept of indissoluble [[Marriage|matrimony]], and parentage was classified according to origin, either from within marriage or outside of wedlock. Children born out of wedlock were further classified as natural, from adultery, from incest, or sacrilegious. This framework excluded non-[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]], who had only gained the right to marry in 1888, with the reform imposed by Law N\u00b0 2.393.\n\n=== Notes by the Codifier ===\nThe Civil Code of Argentina has a unique feature, which is the inclusion of footnotes with the articles, in which V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield explains the origin of, and principles governing, the positions adopted, sometimes citing or inserting laws and paragraphs from a source treatise.\n\nThe presence of these notes stems from a request from the Ministry of Justice, that he annotate each article and its conformity to or divergence from laws currently in force in the country, as well as those of the major world powers.\n\nThe notes are very valuable from a [[Legal doctrine|doctrinal]] standpoint. In them the codifier states the problem, summarizes the arguments and chooses a solution, always in a succinct manner. As a result, the Code became a veritable treatise on [[comparative law]], which proved to be quite useful, as the bibliographic material available at the end of the 19th century was not plentiful.\n\nIt is important to note that the footnotes contain numerous errors and even contradictions ''vis-\u00e0-vis'' the article text, as can be seen in the text of articles 2.311 and 2.312 and the footnote to the former.<ref>In article 2.311 \"things\" are defined as \"physical objects to which a value can be assigned\", while the definition of \"goods\" in article 2.312 includes \"things\" and \"nonmaterial objects to which a value can be assigned\". However, in the footnote to article 2.311 the following is specified: \"''The word 'things', in its common flexible and imprecise usage, in fact encompasses everything that exists, not only objects that can be owned by a person, but everything in nature that cannot be owned in an exclusive manner: the sea, the air, the sun, etc. But as it pertains to private rights, we must limit the scope of the word to those privately held goods that can be assigned a value. Thus, all goods are things, but not all things are goods. A 'thing' is a generic type, and a 'good' is a subtype thereof.''\"</ref> Some of these errors are attributable to the codifier, but others are likely due to circumstances beyond his control. There are instances where V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield reworked an entire title or modified a rule without altering the footnotes pertaining to the original edition. In this manner, for example, all the footnotes in Book IV were brought directly from the original drafts by [[Victorino de la Plaza]] without any of the pertinent modifications.<ref>Chaneton, Abel (1938). ''Historia de V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield''. Buenos Aires: Editorial La Facultad. T. 2, p. 149.</ref> That said, one should keep in mind that during the editing of ''Nueva York'' and ''La Pampa'' many modifications from the original text were accumulated.\n\n== Editions ==\nThe project drawn up by V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield was printed as the author was sending the different books to the government. The first book was printed by the press called \"''La Naci\u00f3n Argentina''\"\" (The Argentine Nation) in 1865, while the rest of the installments were printed by Pablo Cini in 1866, 1867, 1868 and 1869. During 1869 V\u00e9lez trusted Coni with the reprinting of the first book, to maintain homegenity.\n\nThis edition, known as the ''Buenos Aires edition'', had many errors, and the numbering of the articles wasn't done with the work as a whole, but independently in every tome. This numbering method resulted very useful at the time of its writing, as the addition or suppression of new articles required minor touch-ups in the group of articles, but once printed was inefficient.\n\nBecause of this, President Sarmiento insinuated to the codifier the necessity of making a new version that included the typos corrections. Vel\u00e9z S\u00e1rsfield accepted this proposition, and commended this correction work to his cousin Carlos Carranza through a letter:\n{{quote|\"...I want to ask you for the ardous service of reading with utmost care the three last books and correcting in them the printing mistakes or replacing and erasing some words that may be missing or have no need to be there. I insist that you do me this favor with all your powers so the official version be good\"|Cabral Texo (1920). p. 200}}\n\nThe printing was trusted by Sarmiento to the Argentine minister in Washington, D.C., Manuel Garc\u00eda, while the rest of the task was given to the company ''Hallet Breen'', who had quoted $2,000 less than other firms. This edition, renowned as the ''New York edition'', maintained the numbering depending on each tome, and wasn't free of typos either.\n\n== Laws of Errata ==\n[[Image:Domingo Sarmiento.jpg|thumb|200px|right|President [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] pressed for the correction of mistakes in the civil code.]]\nThe first law of Errata was the law No. 527, that sanctioned what the Executive could propose for the new edition of the Civil College New York law, which could introduce a correction of 24 titles.\n\nThis was necessary because when the first copies of this edition arrived in the country at the end of 1870, President [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]'s opposition took advantage of the modifications in the legal code sanctioned by Congress to initiate a media campaign against the government. For this reason [[Victorino de la Plaza]] and Aurelio Prado were appointed to compare both versions and report on the existing differences. While they were doing so, on January 1, 1871 President Sarmiento's decree declared the [[Buenos Aires]] edition to be official.\n\nIn August of that year, Dr. de la Plaza and Dr. Prado reported that they had found 1,882 differences between the two texts, but due to the intrascendencia of many of these alterations, they concluded that the new edition of the code was not contrary to that sanctioned by Congress.<ref>Cabral Texo (1920). Ps. 241\u2013249</ref>\n\nHowever, public opinion was not amiable with this solution, as it declared official a text only nominally approved by the Congress and had a great amount of misprints besides. This last problem was what the senator for [[Province of Tucum\u00e1n|Tucum\u00e1n]] [[Benjam\u00edn Paz]] prepared to rectify, by means of a law project presented in 1878 that noticed 29 new errors. As this project passed through the commissions of the Chambers of Deputies and Senators, the number grew up as far as 285. This 285 errors are the ones that the Law No. 1196 corrects, sanctioned August 29, 1882, commonly known as the ''Law of Errata'', though it was the second of its kind to be sanctioned.\n\nBut all the corrections were not limited to merely formal adjustments: some of them introduced changes in the doctrine of the Civil Code edited by V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield. This is the case of the alteration introduced in the article 325, in whom it was added as a requisite ''sine qua non'' the state of natural son to start an action of [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] after the father's death:\n{{quote|\"The natural children have the right to be recognised by the father of mother, or to be declared as such by the judge, when the parents denied them as being their children, admitting in the paternity of maternity investigation all the proofs that are admitted to prove the facts, and that concur to demonstrate the natural paternity. Not being in the possession of this state, this right can only be exercised by the children during the lifes of the parents\"|Argentine Civil Code, article 325 before its modification by the Law No. 24.779}}\n\nThe Law 1,196 also established the making of a new edition that included the corrections stated in that law. Abiding that disposition, in 1883 the third edition of the Civil Code was made, known as ''The Pampa'' edition for the name of the workshop who did the printing. This edition includes an important modification, being that the articles are number as whole.\n\nIn 1900, President [[Julio A. Roca]] ordered a new edition that eliminated the articles revoked by the ''Civil Marriage Law'' and introduced the new dispositions without altering the numbering of the non-modified articles. At the end of the task, the project was sent to the national government, who in turn passed it to the Faculty of Law of the [[University of Buenos Aires]] to examine it. The Faculty designated a commission, who after the investigation determined that the project introduced reforms in the law doctrine. After asking for a competence extension, the Commission proposed this modifications in 1903, although the project was never dealt with by the Congress.\n\n== Reforms ==\nThe [[rationalist]] notion that all law should be condensed and comprehensively written in a code was challenged by social, economic and political mutations which imposed a need for the text to be constantly updated. One of the issues that divide the doctrine on this subject is the question of whether it is more convenient to make partial reforms of the code or to completely substitute it with another one.\n\nUntil recent times, the Civil Code has only been partially reformed, the most notable reform effort being that associated with Law 17.711. Nevertheless, there have been several projects to replace the Code completely, including one that went so far as to attempt to merge it with the ''Commercial Code''.\n\n=== Partial reforms ===\nThe changes in these laws were made by the court system or by legislative reform, and the ones listed here are only the most influential.\n*[[Civil marriage]] law: The original civil code denied non-[[Catholic Church|Catholic]]s the right to [[Religious aspects of marriage|marry]]. On November 12, 1888, law number 2,393 provided the right of civil marriage, effective immediately.\n*Women's civil right's law. On September 14, 1924 law number 11,357 provided more legal rights for married women.\n*Name: The regulation of people's names was addressed as usually by the codifier, as the decrees 11,609/1943 and 410/1946 regulated this institution.\n*[[Adoption]] law: The original civil code did not regulate adoption. On September 23, 1948, law number 13,252 created regulations.\n*Law of horizontal property: V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield had forbidden the horizontal subdivision of property, which was overruled by law 13,512 made on September 30, 1948.\n*Sales of real estate by installments or sales of fractioned real estate: The Law No. 14,005 regulated the sale by installments of sets of estates, in order to guide the buyers.  It was later modified by the Law No. 23,266.\n*Land registry and prescription: On October 3 the Law No. 14,159 was sanctioned, establishing rules about the cadastre and the acquisition of real estate by prescription.\n*Law about children born inside and outside marriage: Law number 14,367, approved on October 11, 1954, partially removed distinctions between children born inside and outside marriage.\n*Regime about minors and family: Law 14,394 of December 30, 1954 modifies the penal regime of the minors, the minimum age to marry, the simple absence and the decease presumption, and incorporated the ''family good'', which cannot been executed by a debt subsequent to the constitution as such. Another special feature of this law is that in its article 31 implements for the first time in the Argentine legislation the divorce, as part of the fight between [[Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n]]'s government and the [[Catholic Church]]. After the [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]] that overthrew Per\u00f3n, this reform was suspended by the order in council 4070/1956, and later substituted by the law 23,515 in 1987.\n*Registry of motor vehicles: The order in council 6582/1958 created the ''National Registry of Motor Vehicles Property'' and made compulsory the registry of the legal businesses which transmitted their property.\n*Name of physical persons: The existent regulations about the name were replaced by Law No. 18,248, promulgated on October 28, 1968.\n*Adoption: The old law was replaced by law number 19,134 on June 3, 1971.\n*Foundations: Foundations had a void in the code, until Law No. 19,386, which came into effect on September 25, 1972, regulated the regime.\n*Right of private life: On September 30, 1975, Law No. 21,173 was sanctioned, which included the article 1071 bis on the code regulating said right.\n*Transplants: The national regime on [[organ transplant]]s was determined by Law number 21,541, approved on March 18, 1977.\n*Marks and brands: This regime, used for livestock identification, was incorporated to the legislation by means of Law No. 22,939 of October 6, 1983. Previously it was regulated by the rural codes.\n*Law of blood: Law No. 22,990 of November 20, 1983 regulates the uses of human blood.\n*Filiation and paternity authority: Law No. 23,264 of September 25, 1985 compares the children born outside marriage at the same level to those born within, and establishes that [[parental responsibility (access and custody)|parental responsibility]] can be exercised by both parents.\n*Civil marriage: Law No. 23,515 modifies the matrimony regime, and reestablishes the divorce, which had been suspended since 1956.\n*Pact of San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica: Law No. 23,504 ratified the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] which sought to consolidate human rights.\n*Elimination of all kind of woman discrimination: The ratification of the ''Convention about the Elimination of all kinds of Discrimination against Women'' was product of Law No. 23,179.\n*Convertibility Law: The so-called ''[[Convertibility Law]]'' fixed the exchange-rate between australs and dollars, and introduced some reforms to the Civil Code's regime. This law, No. 23,928, allowed to convene that the pacted obligations in a foreign currency were to be resolved only in the stipulated currency. This reforms survived the abandoning of the convertibility regime by the Law No. 25,561.\n*Law of escrow and leasing: Law No. 24,441 incorporated the contract of [[escrow]] and [[leasing]], which meant a great advance for the Argentine legislation.\n\n==== Law No. 17,711 ====\nIn 1966 the State Secretary Office of Justice designated a commission to evaluate a reform to the Civil Code, without determining whether it should be total or partial. In the beginning the commission was made up of Roberto Mart\u00ednez Ruiz, Jos\u00e9 Bidau, [[Guillermo Borda]], Abel Fleitas, Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Olaciregui, Dalmiro Alsina Atienza and Alberto Spota; although after the resignation of the last three, only the doctors Bidau, Fleitas and Mart\u00ednez Ruiz formed the project. Borda occupied at that moment the position of Interior minister, but that didn't stop him from contributing to the project, as the elevation note established, giving \"''evidence of the valuable and effective collaboration made by the minister of Interior, the doctor Guillermo A. Borda, who dedicated long hours to the deliberations (of the Commission), in spite of the multiple tasks due to the official duties of the position he currently occupies''\"<ref>Llamb\u00edas (2003), p. 184.</ref>\n\nLaw No. 17,711 was sanctioned on April 22, 1968, and came into force on July 1 that same year. This law affects approximately 5% of the Civil Code articles (200 articles in whole), but its importance trascends numbers, as it changes some of the backbone criteria of the established regime.\n\nAmong the most important changes, this reform included the theory of [[abuse of rights]], the [[lesion]] vice, the [[good faith]] principle as the rule for interpretation in contracts, the [[theory of unforeseenness]], the limitation of the absolute character of the property, the generous repairing of moral damage in the contractual and extra-contractual civil responsibility, the possibility of reducing the compensation in the forced crimes, the solidarity of the co-authors of forced crimes, the automatic delay as a rule in obligations with deadlines, the implicit resolutory condition in contracts, the registry inscription as publicity for the transmission of [[property law|property rights]] on real estate, the protection of third parties with good faith sub-acquirants of property or personal rights in case of nullity, the acquisition of age at 21, the [[emancipation]] by age abilitation{{typo help inline|reason=similar to habilitation|date=November 2019}}, the extension of the capacity of the working minor, the personal separation by joint proposal and modification of the succession order.\n\nAlthough not all the doctrine agreed then with the changes made by the law, which gave it many criticisms, time proved that the reform was an important advance in the Argentine civil legislation.\n\n=== Integral Reform Projects ===\n\n==== Bibiloni Draft ====\nThis was the first project for integral reform of the Civil Code, which took place in 1926. This project was begun by the Law No. 12,542 and then expanded by 13,156, which established a committee formed by a member designated by the [[Supreme Court of Argentina]], another member by the National Academy of Legal Science (''Academia Nacional de Ciencias Jur\u00eddicas''), designated by each of the Civil Courts (''C\u00e1maras Civiles'') of the [[Buenos Aires|Nation's Capital]], another member by the [[Bar Association]] and another by the department of Right (''facultades de Derecho'') of the national universities of [[University of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]], [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[University of La Plata|La Plata]], and [[National University of the Littoral|del Litoral]].\n\nThe resulting committee was formed by Roberto Repetto, Juli\u00e1n Pera, Raymundo Salvat, Juan Bibiloni, H\u00e9ctor Lafaille, Enrique Mart\u00ednez Paz, Juan Carlos R\u00e9bora, Jos\u00e9 Gervasoni and Rodolfo Rivarola. This committee suffered a few changes, as Salvat resigned and was replaced by C\u00e9sar de Tezanos Pinto, while Pera, who ascended to the position of minister of the Supreme Court, was replaced at first by Mariano de Vedia y Mitre and then by Gast\u00f3n Tobal.\n\nDoctor Bibiloni was commissioned the writing of the draft, which would serve as an orientation for debates. Bibiloni finished in six years, but while he was working different books with the same purpose were being published, similar to [[Dalmacio V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield]]'s bill. Because of this, the committee had started to have debates since 1926 and not 1932.\n\nThis draft has a great influence in German judicial science, not only directly in the [[German Civil Code]], but also through its commentaries. The code also used the same doctoring tool as V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield, the inclusion of footnotes to establish resolutions.\n\n==== Draft of 1936 ====\nThe commission utilized the first draft edited by Bibiloni, but expanded it into a draft law which had great differences with Bibiloni's. Once finished with the first draft, the commission designated Lafaille and Tobal as editors, who sometimes disagreed with what was decided by the commission, and they managed to finish the draft in 1936. In spite of the changes made, the draft was signed by the editors and by Repetto, Rivarola and Mart\u00ednez Paz.\n\nAs far as its methodology, the draft contained a ''General Section'', in which it deals with people, the facts, the things, the practising of the rights and the prescription; and four books in which it deals with the family, the obligations and their sources, the real rights and the succession, and finally it features a law of registries.\n\nThe whole of the articles of the project is relatively brief; it had 2,144 articles. Each article grouped in several paragraphs the solution to the issues related with the subject that was dealt with in the article, which made them dense but facilitated their study.\n\nAfter the conclusion of editing in 1936, the draft was sent to the National Executive Power on October 10 of that year. The Executive Power sent the draft to [[Congreso de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina|Congress]], but it was never ratified.\n\n==== 1954 Draft====\nThe draft for the Civil Code was written in 1954 by the \"Institute of Civil Right\" (''Instituto de Derecho Civil''), dependent on the Ministry of Justice. [[Jorge Joaqu\u00edn Llamb\u00edas]] was the head of the project, with Roberto Ponssa, Jorge Mazzinghi, Jorge Bargall\u00f3 Cirio and Ricardo Alberdi as collaborators.\n\nThe draft contained 1,839 articles, a very small number in comparison with the present Civil Code and other previous projects. Such synthesis was achieved by omitting the repetition of general principles, and defining only the differences to those general principles in the description of the code for particular institutions.\n\nThe used method contains a Preliminary Title, which consists of three chapters with the general resolution, norm on private international law, and the computation of time periods. Divided in five books, Book I deals with the general principles, the persons, property, facts and juridical acts; Book II with the family, Book III deals with inheritance; Book IV with the obligations and Book V regulates the real and intellectual rights.\n\nBecause of the ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'' coup d'\u00e9tat, the project never reached legislative treatment, and remained inedited until 1968, when it was edited by the [[Universidad Nacional de Tucum\u00e1n]].\n\n==== Project of legislative unification ====\nArticle 75 of the [[Constitution of Argentina|Argentine Constitution]], at section 12, empowers the [[Argentine National Congress]] to dictate the Civil, Commercial, Penal, Mining and Work, and Social Security codes. Because of this, part of the doctrine sustained that the Constitution obstructed the legislative unification. Nevertheless, the authors argued that it is not written in which way it should be done, be it by one single body or more.\n\nIn 1986, the General Legislative Commission of the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] created a committee for the \"unification of the civil and commercial legislation\", designing H\u00e9ctor Alegr\u00eda, Atilio Alterini, Jorge Alterini, Miguel Araya, Francisco de la Vega, Sergio Le Pera and Ana Piaggi as advisors, to whom would later join Horacio Fargosi.\n\nOn April 22, 1987, the project was raised, and on July 15 sanctioned by the Chamber of Deputies. The project moved on to the [[Argentine Senate|Senate]], where a temporary commission was formed, which made several reforms, but didn't arrive to a conclusive judgement since its duration was not renovated after the originally intended six months.\n\nAt the end of 1991 the law was sanctioned with no modifications by the Senate, but later the Executive Power, considering it inadequate to the new political and economical situation, decided to veto it.\n\n====C\u00f3digo Civil y Comercial de la Naci\u00f3n====\nAfter decades of deliberations, a new  code - ''C\u00f3digo Civil y Comercial de la Naci\u00f3n'' - was approved in 2014 and entered into force in 2015, replacing the old code.<ref>http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/235000-239999/235975/norma.htm</ref><ref>http://jornadaonline.com/Pol%C3%ADtica/139234-Comienza-a-regir-el-nuevo-C%C3%B3digo-Civil-y-Comercial</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{SPATRAcite|:es:C\u00f3digo Civil de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina|February 2, 2007}}\n\n=== Notes ===\n<div style=\"font-size: 90%;\">\n<references/>\n</div>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050907105943/http://www.redetel.gov.ar/Normativa/Archivos%20de%20Normas/CodigoCivil.htm C\u00f3digo Civil Argentino] (Spanish)\n*[http://www.monografias.com/trabajos6/dear/dear.shtml History of the Argentine Law] (Spanish)\n*[http://www.alterini.org/tonline/to_rh1.htm Civil code, history and reforms] (Spanish)\n\n{{Civil codes by country|South America}}\n{{Argentina topics}}\n\n[[Category:Argentine law]]\n[[Category:Civil codes|Argentine Civil Code]]\n[[Category:Legal codes of Argentina]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2015}}\n[[Image:Edificio del Congreso en Buenos Aires 2004.JPG|thumb|250px|Congress building in Buenos Aires, Argentina]]\n\nThe '''Civil Code of Argentina''' was the [[civil code|legal code]] in force between 1871 and 2015,\nwhich formed the foundation of the [[Legal systems of the world|system]] of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in [[Argentina]]. It was written by [[Dalmacio V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield]], as the culmination of a series of attempts to codify civil law in Argentina. The original code was approved on September 25, 1869, by the passage of [[s:es:Ley 340 Sanci\u00f3n del C\u00f3digo Civil de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina|Law 340]], and became active on January 1, 1871. With numerous subsequent modifications, it continued to be the foundation of Argentine civil law (''Derecho civil argentino'') for more than a century. On 1 August 2015, the Civil Code of Argentina was replaced by a new Civil and Commercial Code - ''C\u00f3digo Civil y Comercial de la Naci\u00f3n''.<ref>http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/235000-239999/235975/norma.htm</ref><ref>http://jornadaonline.com/Pol%C3%ADtica/139234-Comienza-a-regir-el-nuevo-C%C3%B3digo-Civil-y-Comercial</ref>\n\nV\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield's code reflects the influence of the [[Civil law (legal system)|continental law]] and liberal principles of the 17th century. It was also influenced by the great [[Napoleonic code]], the Spanish laws in effect at that time in Argentina, [[Roman law]] (especially through the work of [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Savigny]]), [[canon law]], the draft of the Brazilian civil code (''Esbo\u00e7o de um C\u00f3digo Civil para Brasil'') by [[Augusto Teixeira de Freitas|Freitas]], and the influence of the [[Chilean Civil Code]] (by [[Andr\u00e9s Bello]]).\n\nApproval of the Argentine civil code was necessary for judicial reasons and political reasons. It gave a new coherence and unity to civil law. The civil code's authority over provincial law improved the inconsistent existing legislation throughout the country at the time. This unity and coherence would bring two important benefits: it would facilitate both the people's knowledge about the law, as well as its application by judges, the legislation would also strengthen the political independence of the country, through legislative independence and national unity.\n\nIn spite of the stability brought by the civil code to the Argentine law system, it was subject to various modifications throughout its history, as was necessary to adequately regulate a society undergoing significant social, political and economical changes. The most important reform was Law 17.711 of April 22, 1968. Not only did the law change around 5% of the complete article, it is especially important due to the change in orientation regarding some regulated institutions. There were also other reform projects that were not implemented. Along with proposals to change institutions and methods, one of them proposed to merge the civil code with the ''commercial code'', following the example of the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian code]].\n\nAfter decades of deliberations, a new ''C\u00f3digo Civil y Comercial de la Naci\u00f3n'' was approved in 2014, and entered into force in 2015, replacing the old code.<ref>http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/235000-239999/235975/norma.htm</ref><ref>http://jornadaonline.com/Pol%C3%ADtica/139234-Comienza-a-regir-el-nuevo-C%C3%B3digo-Civil-y-Comercial</ref>\n\n== Precursors ==\n[[Image:JustoJoseUrquiza.jpg|thumb|right|During the [[Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza]] administration many projects were driven forward.]]\nThe codification in Argentina was part of a process being undertaken around the world, due to the advantages that such a systematic approach granted. Indeed, there had been earlier codifications; those completed toward the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century had a strong influence on the compilation of the Civil Code of Argentina. Stemming from these, there were separate attempts at civil codification in the Argentine republic during the first half of the 19th century, but it was finally achieved in 1869.\n\nThe unification of the country and its political growth and strengthening demanded the codification of the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil laws]], since it was not possible to continue under the uncertainty caused by the inadequate code that existed under the rule of the Spanish.\n\nBefore the Civil Code, there had been several attempts to this effect, without success. In 1824, [[Juan Gregorio de las Heras]] issued a decree appointing one commission charged with compiling the Commercial Code and another charged with compiling the Military Code, but neither of these two projects' efforts came to fruition. In 1831, the Legislature of [[Buenos Aires]] adopted the Spanish Commercial Code compiled in 1829 and created a commission to see to any reforms to it that might be necessary. In 1852, [[Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza]] created a commission of 14 members for the compilation of the Civil, Penal, Commercial and Procedural Codes. However, the revolution of September 11 of that year, which resulted in the secession of the [[Provincia de Buenos Aires|Province of Buenos Aires]] from the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Argentina|Argentine Confederacy]], prevented this project from making any concrete progress.\n\nThe [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]], in clause 11 of article 67, authorized the [[Congreso de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina|Argentine National Congress]] to draw up the Civil, Commercial, Penal and Mining Codes. With the intent of fulfilling this constitutional mandate, [[Facundo Zuvir\u00eda]] brought before the [[Senado de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina|Senate]] a law that would empower the Executive Branch to appoint a commission to complete those tasks. The law was passed and signed by Urquiza, but for financial reasons the initiative was postponed.\n\nIn the State of Buenos Aires, an initiative to launch a Civil Code suffered the same fate. On October 17, 1857, a law was passed that authorized the Executive Branch to spend the necessary funds to compile the Civil, Criminal and Procedural Codes, but the initiative was ultimately frustrated.<ref>Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa (1952). ps. 60 y ss.</ref> However, the Commercial Code had better luck. The task of compiling that code had been given to [[Dalmacio V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield]] and [[Eduardo Acevedo Maturana]], who sent it to the legislature for its approval. The Commercial Code of the State of Buenos Aires was finally passed in 1859, and it was this code that was adopted at the national level in 1862 and amended in 1889.\n\n=== Legislation in force prior to its sanction ===\n[[Image:Partidas.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Front page of the [[Siete Partidas]].]]\nUntil the sanction of the Code, the Argentine legislation was based on the Spanish legislation previous to the [[May Revolution]], and on the one called ''Legislaci\u00f3n Patria'' (Native Legislation).\n\nThe Spanish legislation in use in the country was the New Compilation of 1567, since the [[Newest Compilation]] of 1805 did not have application before the revolution. The New Compilation contained laws coming from the ''[[Fuero Real]]'' (Royal Jurisdiction), the ''[[Ordenamiento de Alcal\u00e1]]'' (the Code Law Reordering of Alcal\u00e1), the Reordering of Montalvo and the Laws of [[Toro, Spain|Toro]]. In order of importance: \n*1st New Compilation, \n*2nd Fuero Real, \n*3rd [[Fuero Juzgo]], \n*4th Fuero viejo de Castilla (Old Fuero of Castile), \n*5th the [[Partidas]]. \nNevertheless, the ''Siete Partidas'' (Seven-Part Codes) were more often applied due to their prestige, the extension of the addressed matters, and the further knowledge of them by judges and lawyers.\n\nThe ''Legislaci\u00f3n Patria'' was composed of the laws sanctioned by the provincial and national governments. These laws were of considerably less importance compared to the Spanish legislation and weren't altered, confirming the principle according to which the political [[emancipation]] lets endure the previous private Law until the new State arranges otherwise, in exercise of its sovereignty.<ref>Cabral Texo (1920). p. 1.</ref>\n\nThe primary national laws were the [[liberty of wombs]] (''Libertad de Vientres'') and of the slaves entering the territory (1813), the suppression of entailed states (''[[mayorazgo]]'') (1813) and of [[emphyteusis]] (1826), and the suppression of gentilic retract (1868), that gave the right to re-acquire family real estate sold to a stranger to the nearest relative of the original vendor (up to the 4th grade of kinship).\n\nOther various laws and provincial decrees modifying different institutions existed, as the emancipation by age rating (dictated by [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]] on November 17, 1824, by [[Tucum\u00e1n Province|Tucum\u00e1n]] on September 1, 1860 and by [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre R\u00edos]] on March 10, 1866); the determination of [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] in the main estate (dictated by Buenos Aires on September 16, 1859), about books of births, matrimonies and deaths, being the parish priests in charge (dictated by Buenos Aires on December 19, 1821, by [[provincia de Jujuy|Jujuy]] on September 7, 1836 and by [[provincia de Santa Fe|Santa Fe]] on May 17, 1862); about restrictions and limits to the domains (dictated by Buenos Aires on July 27, 1865, by Jujuy in February 1855 and March 7, 1857, and by [[provincia de C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]] on August 27, 1868); and of the renting of fields (dictated by Santa Fe on July 31, 1837).\n\n== Sanction ==\n[[Image:Velez Sarsfield.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dalmacio V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield]], editor of the Civil Code]]\nArgentina had been attempting without success to join the codifying movement in vogue at that time in some of the world's most powerful nations. The creation of the code would bring several advantages to the legislation that was at that time characterized by its dispersion, and consequently, its difficult implementation. The new system would provide mainly a unity and coherence to the civil legislation, and thus it would help it to be known and applied.\n\nThere were also reasons of judicial nationalism that were motives for its creation, since it was considered necessary to reaffirm the political independence obtained decades before through legislative independence. The legislation most influential on Argentine law was until then the Spanish legislation, sanctioned centuries before, primarily because national law had minimal influence on [[private law]].\n\nFinally, the sanction of a code was hoped to become an efficient instrument for the consolidation of the national unity that had been expensively obtained only a few years earlier. The unification could have been damaged if the [[provinces of Argentina|provinces]] had kept their own laws, or had independently sanctioned new ones to fix the inadequacies in the Spanish one instead of doing it in an unified way.\n\nOn June 6, 1863 Law No. 36, sponsored by deputy Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral from [[Corrientes Province]], was passed, which empowered the [[executive power|executive branch]] to appoint commissions in charge of writing the projects for the Civil, Penal, and Mining Codes and Military Ordinances.\n\nEven though the law allowed for the creation of commissions of several persons, president [[Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre]] decided to put a single person in charge, [[Dalmacio V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield]], through a decree dated October 20, 1864.\n\n[[Image:Vdelaplaza.jpg|thumb|right|[[Victorino de la Plaza]], [[president of Argentina]], was one of V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield's assistants.]]\n\nV\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield redacted the Project for the Civil Code without collaborators other than assistants that would transcribe his drafts. Among them were [[Victorino de la Plaza]], who later would become president, Eduardo D\u00edaz de Vivar and V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield's daughter Aurelia. For the task, V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield withdrew to a country house he owned, located a few kilometers from [[Buenos Aires]] city, where he wrote the drafts that his assistants transcribed. The final transcript was delivered to the government for its printing, and was later destroyed. The drafts can currently be found at the [[Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba]].\n\nAs V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield moved forward with his work, he would send it to the executive branch, which would then print and distribute it among the legislators, magistrates, lawyers and \"competent persons, to allow them to study the work now and build an opinion of it for the time of its ratification\".<ref>Decree dated June 23, 1865. Cabral Texo (1920). ps. 130.</ref> V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield finished Book I in 1865, the first two sections of Book II in 1866, the third section of that book at the beginning of 1867, Book III in 1868, and Book IV in 1869, finishing the code after 4 years and 2 months of work.\n\nThe project completed, President [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] sent a note to the Congress on August 25, 1869 proposing the law that would ratify the project of the Civil Code. In the message, Sarmiento recommended immediate implementation, \"entrusting its reform to the passage of future laws that will be enacted as experience dictates their necessity\".<ref>Cabral Texo (1920), pp. 130ss</ref>\n\nThe Chamber of Deputies approved the project on September 22, 1869 after rejecting various alternate version and objections to its being passed without amendment. The chamber determined that it would become effective on January 1, 1871. It then passed to the Senate, which ratified it on September 25, and it was promulgated by Sarmiento on September 29.\n\nThe Project was closed-book endorsed, that is it was accepted without changes to the original, which according to Llamb\u00edas did not require any debate:\n\n{{quote|Parliamentary bodies, due to their composition and functioning, lack the capacity to undertake the study and analytical debate related to a scientific task of such a delicate systematic nature as a Code.

These sources can be classified as follows: [[Roman law]], Spanish and Argentine law, [[canon law]], the [[Napoleonic Code]] and its commentaries, the work of Freitas, and various other minor sources.\n\n=== Roman law ===\nRoman law was not a direct influence on the civil code in the sense that none of its dispositions were directly extracted from the [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]] or from any Roman jurist's passage. Nevertheless, V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield returned to the Roman criteria in some institutions' regulations, even those that hadn't been addressed by the contemporary codification. That was the case of [[property]] transmitted by \"tradition\", as opposed to the French code, which had changed it to transmission by \"consentment\". Moreover, among the notes of the codifier there are quotes of those laws, but they are second-hand references.\n\nThe indirect Roman influence is reflected in the most part in the doctrines used by the author, especially as regards patrimonial structures. The main influence on the work of V\u00e9lez Sarsfield was the German Romanist [[Friedrich Karl von Savigny]] with his work \"System of the present Roman law\" (''System des heutigen r\u00f6mischen Rechts''), used especially referring to [[Juristic person|legal entities]], obligations, property and possession, and the adoption of the [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] principle as a determining element of the law, applicable to the people's marital status and [[Capacity (law)|capacity]].\n\n=== Spanish and native legislation ===\nOnce he finished the gathering process, V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield was criticized for ignoring the Spanish legislation, which by the time was the one in effect in Argentina. One of these critics was [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], who was refuted by the modernizing critic and by V\u00e9lez himself:\n{{quote|\"Had Dr. Alberdi gone at least lightly through my project, he would have found that the first source I make use of at the laws that rule us. The biggest number of articles have a note on the law of [[Siete Partidas|Partidas]], of the Royal Forum, of the recopilated ones. \"|Cabral Texo, Jorge. \"Juicios cr\u00edticos sobre el C\u00f3digo Civil argentino\", p. 249.}}\n\nThe influence of this legislation regarding its method and technique was practically null, what can be understood due to the dispersion that characterized it. Nevertheless, on the material, and the sense and reach of the dispositions, V\u00e9lez did make use of the old Right, adopting it to the new needs.\n\nThe national legislation had little relevance on private law, though it did partially influence on the work of the Coder. Such is the case of the hereditary vocation of the article 3,572, whose antecedent is the law dictated by the legislature of the [[Buenos Aires Province]] dictated on May 22, 1857. V\u00e9lez had also in mind the uses and customs of the country, especially regarding the family organisation.\n\n=== Canon law ===\n[[Canon law]] had a large influence over [[family law]], especially in the area of matrimony. V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield left matrimony under the jurisdiction of the [[Catholic Church]], taking the institution of canonical marriage and giving it civil effects. But the validity of matrimony was unchanged from the canonical version and the dispositions of the ecclesiastical courts, which would remain until the sanction of the law of civil matrimony. About this, V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield expressed:\n{{quote|\"Catholic people, such as the people of the Argentine Republic, would not be able to contract civil matrimony. For them it would be an endless concubinage, condemned by the religion and customs of the country. Any law that would authorize such matrimonies, in the present state of our society, would ignore the mission of the laws, which is to keep and strengthen the power of customs, not to weaken and corrupt them. It would give incentive to Catholic people to ignore the precepts of their religion, without a beneficial result for individuals or families.<br/>\nFor those who do not profess the Catholic religion, a law that gives marriage a religious characteristic does not attack in any sense the freedom of cult, for the law doesn't force anyone to renounce their beliefs. Each one can invoke God from the altar of one's own cult.\" .\"|Note on article 167, C\u00f3digo Civil Argentino}}\nThis resolution by V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield is explained by the uses and customs of that time, as it shows the sanction of a law of civil matrimony by the legislature of the [[Santa Fe Province]] in 1867: the law produced a popular reaction that ended with the resignation of the governor and the dissolution of the legislature house, which annulled the law when it was reconstituted.\n\n=== Napoleon's Code ===\nThe influence of this code in the Coder movement proved very important, and the Civil Code of Argentina did not escape from this influence, being in a direct way or through his commentators.\n\nThe direct influence can be shown in the 145 articles copied from the French code.<ref>Segovia (1933). T. 1, ''Introduction''</ref> But the main direct influence of the commentators is that of the treta of [[Charles Aubry]] and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Charles Rau, specially the third edition published in Paris between 1856 and 1858, of which the Coder took several passages that he used in around 700 articles.<ref>Segovia (1933). T. 1, ''Introduction'', p. XX</ref> The work of [[Raymond Troplong]] provided the material for 50 articles related to the testament inheritance, and others for the real rights. From [[Jean Demolombe]] he took 52 articles for book IV and 9 for book III, from Chabot he used 18 articles for book IV, and from Zachariae 70 articles.<ref>Segovia (1933). ''loc. cit.''</ref>\n\n=== Freitas's work ===\nThe influence of Brazilian lawyer [[Augusto Teixeira de Freitas]] came from two of his works: the \"Consolidation of the civil laws\" (''Consolida\u00e7\u00e3o das Leis Civis'') and his \"Draft of a civil code for Brazil\" (''Esbo\u00e7o de um C\u00f3digo Civil pra Brasil'').\n\nThe \u2018\u2019Consolidation of the civil laws\u2019\u2019 sorts in 1,333 articles the material of the Portuguese legislation, that contained the same dispersion present in the Spanish legislation in use in the Americas. His \"Draft\" was commended to him by the [[Empire of Brazil]] in 1859, but remained unfinished after completion of article 4,908, without reaching the inheritance section. In spite of this, it was one of the most frequently consulted works by V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield; the first three books of the Argentine Civil Code contain more than 1,200 articles from the ''Draft''.\n\n=== Other sources ===\nV\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield also used a number of different Codes and doctrine works that had a secondary influence in the Argentine Civil Code.\n\nAfter the [[Napoleonic code|French Code]], the most influential code was the [[Chilean Civil Code]],<ref>http://www.bcn.cl/leyes/pdf/actualizado/172986.pdf</ref> promulgated on 1855 and written by lawman [[Andr\u00e9s Bello]]. That code was highly valuated by the Argentine Coder, and it is estimated that he based on it for the formulation of 170 articles of the Argentine code.\n\nHe also made use of the Code of [[Louisiana]], in which he based for the creation of 52 articles, of the [[Albertine Code]] for the Sardonic States, of the legislative Russian consolidation, the Code of Parma, the Code of [[Two Sicilies]], the General [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] Code of 1874, the Austrian Code of 1811, the Code of [[New York State]] and the Italian Code of 1865.\n\nV\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield made also use of the 1851 project for the [[Spanish Civil Code]] prepared by [[Florencio Garc\u00eda Goyena]]. That project held 3,000 articles, and it's calculated that it helped in the formulation of 300 articles of the Argentine Code.<ref>Segovia (1933). ''Introduction'', p. XIX.</ref>\n\nFinally, V\u00e9lez used 27 articles from the 1851 project for the Uruguayan Civil Code by [[Eduardo Acevedo Maturana]], as well as some references for his notes.\n\n== Structure ==\nMethod is of crucial importance in a codification work, due its systematic nature, and to the vastness of the subject. Hence it is important to regard and direct man's behavior through general and specific formulae that find their appropriate place among the assembled articles.\n\nV\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield dedicated much effort to the selection of an adequate method, and after receiving objections to the use of the methods of [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s ''Institutiones'' and of the [[Napoleonic code|French civil code]], he decided to use the one followed by Freitas in his ''Consolida\u00e7ao das Leis Civis'', which finds its origins in the teachings of [[Friedrich Karl von Savigny]].\n\nAccording to Freitas's ideas, it is convenient to commence a Code Law by the general dispositions, then address the ones referred to the subject of every legal relation (\"[[Person|the theory of persons]]\"). But, as men don't live isolated but in their family's bosom, it must be continued with the [[Family law]]. Then the individual enters the civil life and establishes links person-to-person: the \"[[Law of obligations|obligations]]\", or person-to-the-things submitted to him: the \"[[real property]]\". Finally it must be legislated about the theory of [[Estate (law)|estate]], with the \"[[Order of succession|successions]]\" and the \"theory of privileges\". To end, the institution of [[Statute of limitations|prescriptions]], that, as referring to the rights as a whole, it was considered appropriate to locate it in a section inside the common dispositions to the real and personal rights.\n\nThus, the Civil Code organisation is the following:\n*'''Preliminary titles:''' the Civil Code begins with two preliminary titles. The first title deals with the laws and elaborated a \"general theory of the law\". The second refers to the way of counting the intervals in law.\n*'''Book I:''' This book is dedicated to the people. Its first section \"Of the people in general\", deals with the persons themselves, and the second, \"On personal rights in family relationships\", with the family.\n*'''Book II:''' This book is divided into three sections. The first deals with the obligations in general and their limits. The second, talks about the judicial acts and doings that produced the acquisition, modification, transfer and lose of the rights and obligations. Finally, the third deals with obligations from contracts.\n*'''Book III:''' This book talks about real rights, dealing with things themselves, or in relation with the persons.\n*'''Book IV:''' This book contains a preliminary title about the transmission of rights in general. It then has three sections: the first about successions ''[[mortis causa]]'', the second about privileges and right of keeping, and the third about [[custom (law)|prescription]].\n\n=== Fundamental principles ===\nThe compilation of the Civil Code was organized around a set of fundamental principles, which were based on ideas in vogue at the time of its compilation:\n*Sovereign will principle: The terms specified in contracts should be respected as if they were law, insofar as the exercise of a right would not constitute an illicit act. However, jurisprudence has established restrictions on this principle, as specified by Article 953, in the so-called \"moral clause\": \"''The object of legal compacts should be acts that are not contrary to respected custom.''\"\n*Responsibility based on fault: [[responsabilidad civil|Civil responsibility]] was grounded in the idea of [[Culpability|fault]]. Article 1067 establishes that no punishable illicit act exists where there has been no harm caused, or exterior action that could cause harm, and without the ability to impute [[Mens rea]], fault or negligence to the actor.\n*Absolute right to property: The right of private property allows one to use, enjoy, and even destroy something owned, but there are certain limitations imposed on the reach of this right, and jurisprudence establishes restrictions, based on the aforementioned Article 953. The justification of the right to destroy property is established in the following note found in Article 2.513: \"''[...] But it must be recognized that with absolute right to property, comes the right to destroy property. Any preventive restriction would cause more harm than good. If the state acts as an arbiter of abuse, soon it will begin to act as arbiter of use, and any real notion of private property and liberty would be lost.''\"\n*Family grounded in indissoluble matrimony: [[Family law]] was grounded in the concept of indissoluble [[Marriage|matrimony]], and parentage was classified according to origin, either from within marriage or outside of wedlock. Children born out of wedlock were further classified as natural, from adultery, from incest, or sacrilegious. This framework excluded non-[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]], who had only gained the right to marry in 1888, with the reform imposed by Law N\u00b0 2.393.\n\n=== Notes by the Codifier ===\nThe Civil Code of Argentina has a unique feature, which is the inclusion of footnotes with the articles, in which V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield explains the origin of, and principles governing, the positions adopted, sometimes citing or inserting laws and paragraphs from a source treatise.\n\nThe presence of these notes stems from a request from the Ministry of Justice, that he annotate each article and its conformity to or divergence from laws currently in force in the country, as well as those of the major world powers.\n\nThe notes are very valuable from a [[Legal doctrine|doctrinal]] standpoint. In them the codifier states the problem, summarizes the arguments and chooses a solution, always in a succinct manner. As a result, the Code became a veritable treatise on [[comparative law]], which proved to be quite useful, as the bibliographic material available at the end of the 19th century was not plentiful.\n\nIt is important to note that the footnotes contain numerous errors and even contradictions ''vis-\u00e0-vis'' the article text, as can be seen in the text of articles 2.311 and 2.312 and the footnote to the former.<ref>In article 2.311 \"things\" are defined as \"physical objects to which a value can be assigned\", while the definition of \"goods\" in article 2.312 includes \"things\" and \"nonmaterial objects to which a value can be assigned\". However, in the footnote to article 2.311 the following is specified: \"''The word 'things', in its common flexible and imprecise usage, in fact encompasses everything that exists, not only objects that can be owned by a person, but everything in nature that cannot be owned in an exclusive manner: the sea, the air, the sun, etc. But as it pertains to private rights, we must limit the scope of the word to those privately held goods that can be assigned a value. Thus, all goods are things, but not all things are goods. A 'thing' is a generic type, and a 'good' is a subtype thereof.''\"</ref> Some of these errors are attributable to the codifier, but others are likely due to circumstances beyond his control. There are instances where V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield reworked an entire title or modified a rule without altering the footnotes pertaining to the original edition. In this manner, for example, all the footnotes in Book IV were brought directly from the original drafts by [[Victorino de la Plaza]] without any of the pertinent modifications.<ref>Chaneton, Abel (1938). ''Historia de V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield''. Buenos Aires: Editorial La Facultad. T. 2, p. 149.</ref> That said, one should keep in mind that during the editing of ''Nueva York'' and ''La Pampa'' many modifications from the original text were accumulated.\n\n== Editions ==\nThe project drawn up by V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield was printed as the author was sending the different books to the government. The first book was printed by the press called \"''La Naci\u00f3n Argentina''\"\" (The Argentine Nation) in 1865, while the rest of the installments were printed by Pablo Cini in 1866, 1867, 1868 and 1869. During 1869 V\u00e9lez trusted Coni with the reprinting of the first book, to maintain homegenity.\n\nThis edition, known as the ''Buenos Aires edition'', had many errors, and the numbering of the articles wasn't done with the work as a whole, but independently in every tome. This numbering method resulted very useful at the time of its writing, as the addition or suppression of new articles required minor touch-ups in the group of articles, but once printed was inefficient.\n\nBecause of this, President Sarmiento insinuated to the codifier the necessity of making a new version that included the typos corrections. Vel\u00e9z S\u00e1rsfield accepted this proposition, and commended this correction work to his cousin Carlos Carranza through a letter:\n{{quote|\"...I want to ask you for the ardous service of reading with utmost care the three last books and correcting in them the printing mistakes or replacing and erasing some words that may be missing or have no need to be there. I insist that you do me this favor with all your powers so the official version be good\"|Cabral Texo (1920). p. 200}}\n\nThe printing was trusted by Sarmiento to the Argentine minister in Washington, D.C., Manuel Garc\u00eda, while the rest of the task was given to the company ''Hallet Breen'', who had quoted $2,000 less than other firms. This edition, renowned as the ''New York edition'', maintained the numbering depending on each tome, and wasn't free of typos either.\n\n== Laws of Errata ==\n[[Image:Domingo Sarmiento.jpg|thumb|200px|right|President [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] pressed for the correction of mistakes in the civil code.]]\nThe first law of Errata was the law No. 527, that sanctioned what the Executive could propose for the new edition of the Civil College New York law, which could introduce a correction of 24 titles.\n\nThis was necessary because when the first copies of this edition arrived in the country at the end of 1870, President [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]'s opposition took advantage of the modifications in the legal code sanctioned by Congress to initiate a media campaign against the government. For this reason [[Victorino de la Plaza]] and Aurelio Prado were appointed to compare both versions and report on the existing differences. While they were doing so, on January 1, 1871 President Sarmiento's decree declared the [[Buenos Aires]] edition to be official.\n\nIn August of that year, Dr. de la Plaza and Dr. Prado reported that they had found 1,882 differences between the two texts, but due to the intrascendencia of many of these alterations, they concluded that the new edition of the code was not contrary to that sanctioned by Congress.<ref>Cabral Texo (1920). Ps. 241\u2013249</ref>\n\nHowever, public opinion was not amiable with this solution, as it declared official a text only nominally approved by the Congress and had a great amount of misprints besides. This last problem was what the senator for [[Province of Tucum\u00e1n|Tucum\u00e1n]] [[Benjam\u00edn Paz]] prepared to rectify, by means of a law project presented in 1878 that noticed 29 new errors. As this project passed through the commissions of the Chambers of Deputies and Senators, the number grew up as far as 285. This 285 errors are the ones that the Law No. 1196 corrects, sanctioned August 29, 1882, commonly known as the ''Law of Errata'', though it was the second of its kind to be sanctioned.\n\nBut all the corrections were not limited to merely formal adjustments: some of them introduced changes in the doctrine of the Civil Code edited by V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield. This is the case of the alteration introduced in the article 325, in whom it was added as a requisite ''sine qua non'' the state of natural son to start an action of [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] after the father's death:\n{{quote|\"The natural children have the right to be recognised by the father of mother, or to be declared as such by the judge, when the parents denied them as being their children, admitting in the paternity of maternity investigation all the proofs that are admitted to prove the facts, and that concur to demonstrate the natural paternity. Not being in the possession of this state, this right can only be exercised by the children during the lifes of the parents\"|Argentine Civil Code, article 325 before its modification by the Law No. 24.779}}\n\nThe Law 1,196 also established the making of a new edition that included the corrections stated in that law. Abiding that disposition, in 1883 the third edition of the Civil Code was made, known as ''The Pampa'' edition for the name of the workshop who did the printing. This edition includes an important modification, being that the articles are number as whole.\n\nIn 1900, President [[Julio A. Roca]] ordered a new edition that eliminated the articles revoked by the ''Civil Marriage Law'' and introduced the new dispositions without altering the numbering of the non-modified articles. At the end of the task, the project was sent to the national government, who in turn passed it to the Faculty of Law of the [[University of Buenos Aires]] to examine it. The Faculty designated a commission, who after the investigation determined that the project introduced reforms in the law doctrine. After asking for a competence extension, the Commission proposed this modifications in 1903, although the project was never dealt with by the Congress.\n\n== Reforms ==\nThe [[rationalist]] notion that all law should be condensed and comprehensively written in a code was challenged by social, economic and political mutations which imposed a need for the text to be constantly updated. One of the issues that divide the doctrine on this subject is the question of whether it is more convenient to make partial reforms of the code or to completely substitute it with another one.\n\nUntil recent times, the Civil Code has only been partially reformed, the most notable reform effort being that associated with Law 17.711. Nevertheless, there have been several projects to replace the Code completely, including one that went so far as to attempt to merge it with the ''Commercial Code''.\n\n=== Partial reforms ===\nThe changes in these laws were made by the court system or by legislative reform, and the ones listed here are only the most influential.\n*[[Civil marriage]] law: The original civil code denied non-[[Catholic Church|Catholic]]s the right to [[Religious aspects of marriage|marry]]. On November 12, 1888, law number 2,393 provided the right of civil marriage, effective immediately.\n*Women's civil right's law. On September 14, 1924 law number 11,357 provided more legal rights for married women.\n*Name: The regulation of people's names was addressed as usually by the codifier, as the decrees 11,609/1943 and 410/1946 regulated this institution.\n*[[Adoption]] law: The original civil code did not regulate adoption. On September 23, 1948, law number 13,252 created regulations.\n*Law of horizontal property: V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield had forbidden the horizontal subdivision of property, which was overruled by law 13,512 made on September 30, 1948.\n*Sales of real estate by installments or sales of fractioned real estate: The Law No. 14,005 regulated the sale by installments of sets of estates, in order to guide the buyers.  It was later modified by the Law No. 23,266.\n*Land registry and prescription: On October 3 the Law No. 14,159 was sanctioned, establishing rules about the cadastre and the acquisition of real estate by prescription.\n*Law about children born inside and outside marriage: Law number 14,367, approved on October 11, 1954, partially removed distinctions between children born inside and outside marriage.\n*Regime about minors and family: Law 14,394 of December 30, 1954 modifies the penal regime of the minors, the minimum age to marry, the simple absence and the decease presumption, and incorporated the ''family good'', which cannot been executed by a debt subsequent to the constitution as such. Another special feature of this law is that in its article 31 implements for the first time in the Argentine legislation the divorce, as part of the fight between [[Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n]]'s government and the [[Catholic Church]]. After the [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]] that overthrew Per\u00f3n, this reform was suspended by the order in council 4070/1956, and later substituted by the law 23,515 in 1987.\n*Registry of motor vehicles: The order in council 6582/1958 created the ''National Registry of Motor Vehicles Property'' and made compulsory the registry of the legal businesses which transmitted their property.\n*Name of physical persons: The existent regulations about the name were replaced by Law No. 18,248, promulgated on October 28, 1968.\n*Adoption: The old law was replaced by law number 19,134 on June 3, 1971.\n*Foundations: Foundations had a void in the code, until Law No. 19,386, which came into effect on September 25, 1972, regulated the regime.\n*Right of private life: On September 30, 1975, Law No. 21,173 was sanctioned, which included the article 1071 bis on the code regulating said right.\n*Transplants: The national regime on [[organ transplant]]s was determined by Law number 21,541, approved on March 18, 1977.\n*Marks and brands: This regime, used for livestock identification, was incorporated to the legislation by means of Law No. 22,939 of October 6, 1983. Previously it was regulated by the rural codes.\n*Law of blood: Law No. 22,990 of November 20, 1983 regulates the uses of human blood.\n*Filiation and paternity authority: Law No. 23,264 of September 25, 1985 compares the children born outside marriage at the same level to those born within, and establishes that [[parental responsibility (access and custody)|parental responsibility]] can be exercised by both parents.\n*Civil marriage: Law No. 23,515 modifies the matrimony regime, and reestablishes the divorce, which had been suspended since 1956.\n*Pact of San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica: Law No. 23,504 ratified the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] which sought to consolidate human rights.\n*Elimination of all kind of woman discrimination: The ratification of the ''Convention about the Elimination of all kinds of Discrimination against Women'' was product of Law No. 23,179.\n*Convertibility Law: The so-called ''[[Convertibility Law]]'' fixed the exchange-rate between australs and dollars, and introduced some reforms to the Civil Code's regime. This law, No. 23,928, allowed to convene that the pacted obligations in a foreign currency were to be resolved only in the stipulated currency. This reforms survived the abandoning of the convertibility regime by the Law No. 25,561.\n*Law of escrow and leasing: Law No. 24,441 incorporated the contract of [[escrow]] and [[leasing]], which meant a great advance for the Argentine legislation.\n\n==== Law No. 17,711 ====\nIn 1966 the State Secretary Office of Justice designated a commission to evaluate a reform to the Civil Code, without determining whether it should be total or partial. In the beginning the commission was made up of Roberto Mart\u00ednez Ruiz, Jos\u00e9 Bidau, [[Guillermo Borda]], Abel Fleitas, Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Olaciregui, Dalmiro Alsina Atienza and Alberto Spota; although after the resignation of the last three, only the doctors Bidau, Fleitas and Mart\u00ednez Ruiz formed the project. Borda occupied at that moment the position of Interior minister, but that didn't stop him from contributing to the project, as the elevation note established, giving \"''evidence of the valuable and effective collaboration made by the minister of Interior, the doctor Guillermo A. Borda, who dedicated long hours to the deliberations (of the Commission), in spite of the multiple tasks due to the official duties of the position he currently occupies''\"<ref>Llamb\u00edas (2003), p. 184.</ref>\n\nLaw No. 17,711 was sanctioned on April 22, 1968, and came into force on July 1 that same year. This law affects approximately 5% of the Civil Code articles (200 articles in whole), but its importance trascends numbers, as it changes some of the backbone criteria of the established regime.\n\nAmong the most important changes, this reform included the theory of [[abuse of rights]], the [[lesion]] vice, the [[good faith]] principle as the rule for interpretation in contracts, the [[theory of unforeseenness]], the limitation of the absolute character of the property, the generous repairing of moral damage in the contractual and extra-contractual civil responsibility, the possibility of reducing the compensation in the forced crimes, the solidarity of the co-authors of forced crimes, the automatic delay as a rule in obligations with deadlines, the implicit resolutory condition in contracts, the registry inscription as publicity for the transmission of [[property law|property rights]] on real estate, the protection of third parties with good faith sub-acquirants of property or personal rights in case of nullity, the acquisition of age at 21, the [[emancipation]] by age abilitation{{typo help inline|reason=similar to habilitation|date=November 2019}}, the extension of the capacity of the working minor, the personal separation by joint proposal and modification of the succession order.\n\nAlthough not all the doctrine agreed then with the changes made by the law, which gave it many criticisms, time proved that the reform was an important advance in the Argentine civil legislation.\n\n=== Integral Reform Projects ===\n\n==== Bibiloni Draft ====\nThis was the first project for integral reform of the Civil Code, which took place in 1926. This project was begun by the Law No. 12,542 and then expanded by 13,156, which established a committee formed by a member designated by the [[Supreme Court of Argentina]], another member by the National Academy of Legal Science (''Academia Nacional de Ciencias Jur\u00eddicas''), designated by each of the Civil Courts (''C\u00e1maras Civiles'') of the [[Buenos Aires|Nation's Capital]], another member by the [[Bar Association]] and another by the department of Right (''facultades de Derecho'') of the national universities of [[University of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]], [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[University of La Plata|La Plata]], and [[National University of the Littoral|del Litoral]].\n\nThe resulting committee was formed by Roberto Repetto, Juli\u00e1n Pera, Raymundo Salvat, Juan Bibiloni, H\u00e9ctor Lafaille, Enrique Mart\u00ednez Paz, Juan Carlos R\u00e9bora, Jos\u00e9 Gervasoni and Rodolfo Rivarola. This committee suffered a few changes, as Salvat resigned and was replaced by C\u00e9sar de Tezanos Pinto, while Pera, who ascended to the position of minister of the Supreme Court, was replaced at first by Mariano de Vedia y Mitre and then by Gast\u00f3n Tobal.\n\nDoctor Bibiloni was commissioned the writing of the draft, which would serve as an orientation for debates. Bibiloni finished in six years, but while he was working different books with the same purpose were being published, similar to [[Dalmacio V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield]]'s bill. Because of this, the committee had started to have debates since 1926 and not 1932.\n\nThis draft has a great influence in German judicial science, not only directly in the [[German Civil Code]], but also through its commentaries. The code also used the same doctoring tool as V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield, the inclusion of footnotes to establish resolutions.\n\n==== Draft of 1936 ====\nThe commission utilized the first draft edited by Bibiloni, but expanded it into a draft law which had great differences with Bibiloni's. Once finished with the first draft, the commission designated Lafaille and Tobal as editors, who sometimes disagreed with what was decided by the commission, and they managed to finish the draft in 1936. In spite of the changes made, the draft was signed by the editors and by Repetto, Rivarola and Mart\u00ednez Paz.\n\nAs far as its methodology, the draft contained a ''General Section'', in which it deals with people, the facts, the things, the practising of the rights and the prescription; and four books in which it deals with the family, the obligations and their sources, the real rights and the succession, and finally it features a law of registries.\n\nThe whole of the articles of the project is relatively brief; it had 2,144 articles. Each article grouped in several paragraphs the solution to the issues related with the subject that was dealt with in the article, which made them dense but facilitated their study.\n\nAfter the conclusion of editing in 1936, the draft was sent to the National Executive Power on October 10 of that year. The Executive Power sent the draft to [[Congreso de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina|Congress]], but it was never ratified.\n\n==== 1954 Draft====\nThe draft for the Civil Code was written in 1954 by the \"Institute of Civil Right\" (''Instituto de Derecho Civil''), dependent on the Ministry of Justice. [[Jorge Joaqu\u00edn Llamb\u00edas]] was the head of the project, with Roberto Ponssa, Jorge Mazzinghi, Jorge Bargall\u00f3 Cirio and Ricardo Alberdi as collaborators.\n\nThe draft contained 1,839 articles, a very small number in comparison with the present Civil Code and other previous projects. Such synthesis was achieved by omitting the repetition of general principles, and defining only the differences to those general principles in the description of the code for particular institutions.\n\nThe used method contains a Preliminary Title, which consists of three chapters with the general resolution, norm on private international law, and the computation of time periods. Divided in five books, Book I deals with the general principles, the persons, property, facts and juridical acts; Book II with the family, Book III deals with inheritance; Book IV with the obligations and Book V regulates the real and intellectual rights.\n\nBecause of the ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'' coup d'\u00e9tat, the project never reached legislative treatment, and remained inedited until 1968, when it was edited by the [[Universidad Nacional de Tucum\u00e1n]].\n\n==== Project of legislative unification ====\nArticle 75 of the [[Constitution of Argentina|Argentine Constitution]], at section 12, empowers the [[Argentine National Congress]] to dictate the Civil, Commercial, Penal, Mining and Work, and Social Security codes. Because of this, part of the doctrine sustained that the Constitution obstructed the legislative unification. Nevertheless, the authors argued that it is not written in which way it should be done, be it by one single body or more.\n\nIn 1986, the General Legislative Commission of the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] created a committee for the \"unification of the civil and commercial legislation\", designing H\u00e9ctor Alegr\u00eda, Atilio Alterini, Jorge Alterini, Miguel Araya, Francisco de la Vega, Sergio Le Pera and Ana Piaggi as advisors, to whom would later join Horacio Fargosi.\n\nOn April 22, 1987, the project was raised, and on July 15 sanctioned by the Chamber of Deputies. The project moved on to the [[Argentine Senate|Senate]], where a temporary commission was formed, which made several reforms, but didn't arrive to a conclusive judgement since its duration was not renovated after the originally intended six months.\n\nAt the end of 1991 the law was sanctioned with no modifications by the Senate, but later the Executive Power, considering it inadequate to the new political and economical situation, decided to veto it.\n\n====C\u00f3digo Civil y Comercial de la Naci\u00f3n====\nAfter decades of deliberations, a new  code - ''C\u00f3digo Civil y Comercial de la Naci\u00f3n'' - was approved in 2014 and entered into force in 2015, replacing the old code.<ref>http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/235000-239999/235975/norma.htm</ref><ref>http://jornadaonline.com/Pol%C3%ADtica/139234-Comienza-a-regir-el-nuevo-C%C3%B3digo-Civil-y-Comercial</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{SPATRAcite|:es:C\u00f3digo Civil de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina|February 2, 2007}}\n\n=== Notes ===\n<div style=\"font-size: 90%;\">\n<references/>\n</div>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050907105943/http://www.redetel.gov.ar/Normativa/Archivos%20de%20Normas/CodigoCivil.htm C\u00f3digo Civil Argentino] (Spanish)\n*[http://www.monografias.com/trabajos6/dear/dear.shtml History of the Argentine Law] (Spanish)\n*[http://www.alterini.org/tonline/to_rh1.htm Civil code, history and reforms] (Spanish)\n\n{{Civil codes by country|South America}}\n{{Argentina topics}}\n\n[[Category:Argentine law]]\n[[Category:Civil codes|Argentine Civil Code]]\n", "name_user": "Onwa", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192Civil (1871-2015)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Code_of_Argentina"}

The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The Commune elections were held on 26 March. They elected a Commune council of 92 members, one member for each 20,000 residents.<ref>Rougerie, Jacques, ''La Commune de Paris''. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France. {{ISBN|978-2-13-062078-5}}.</ref> Despite internal differences, the council began to organise public services. It reached a consensus on certain policies that tended towards a progressive, secular and highly democratic [[social democracy]].\n\nBecause the Commune was able to meet on fewer than 60 days in total, only a few decrees were actually implemented. These included the [[separation of church and state]]; the remission of rents owed for the period of the siege (during which payment had been suspended); the abolition of [[Shift work|night work]] in the hundreds of Paris [[bakeries]]; the granting of pensions to the unmarried companions and children of National Guards killed on active service; and the free return of all workmen's tools and household items valued up to 20 francs that had been pledged during the siege.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre, La Commune\">Milza, Pierre, ''La Commune''.</ref> The Commune was concerned that skilled workers had been forced to pawn their tools during the war; the postponement of commercial [[debt]] obligations and the abolition of interest on the debts; and the [[workers' self-management|right of employees to take over and run an enterprise]] if it were deserted by its owner.

In 1865 and 1866, it held a preliminary conference and had its first congress in [[Geneva]], respectively. Due to their wide variety of philosophies, conflict immediately erupted. The first objections to Marx came from the mutualists who opposed [[state socialism]]. Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into camps headed by Marx and Bakunin.<ref>\"It is unnecessary to repeat the accounts of the Geneva and Hague Congresses of the International in which the issues between Marx and Bakunin were fought out and the organisation itself split apart into the dying Marxist rump centered around the New York General Council and the anti-authoritarian majority centred around the Bakuninist Jura Federation.

Like Proudhonists, they asserted the right of each individual to the product of his labour and to be remunerated for his particular contribution to production. By contrast, [[anarcho-communists]] sought collective ownership of both the means and the products of labour. [[Errico Malatesta]] put it: \"[I]nstead of running the risk of making a confusion in trying to distinguish what you and I each do, let us all work and put everything in common.

Revolutionary socialists quickly targeted reformism: [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay ''[[Social Reform or Revolution]]?'' [[Revolutionary socialism]] encompasses multiple social and political movements that may define \"revolution\" differently. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) in Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe, despite working illegally until the anti-socialist laws were dropped in 1890. In the 1893 elections, it gained 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast, according to Engels.

He observed that as capitalism had further developed in Europe and America, the workers remained unable to gain [[class consciousness]] so long as they were too busy working to pay their expenses. He therefore proposed that the social revolution would require the leadership of a [[vanguard party]] of class-conscious revolutionaries from the educated and politically active part of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ess_leninscritique.html |title=Commanding Heights: Lenin's Critique of Global Capitalism |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nUpon arriving in [[Petrograd]], Lenin declared that the revolution in Russia had only begun, and that the next step was for the workers' [[soviet (council)|soviet]]s to take full authority.

The Labour Party ruled that Militant was ineligible for affiliation with the Labour Party, and the party gradually expelled Militant supporters. The Kinnock leadership had refused to support the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|1984\u20131985 miner's strike]] over pit closures, a decision that the party's left wing and the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] blamed for the strike's eventual defeat. In 1989 at Stockholm, the 18th Congress of the Socialist International adopted a new Declaration of Principles, saying: <blockquote>Democratic socialism is an international movement for freedom, social justice, and solidarity. Its goal is to achieve a peaceful world where these basic values can be enhanced and where each individual can live a meaningful life with the full development of his or her personality and talents, and with the guarantee of human and civil rights in a democratic framework of society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222070726/http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html|url-status=dead|title=Socialist International \u2013 Progressive Politics for a Fairer World|archive-date=22 February 2008}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the 1990s, the British Labour Party under [[Tony Blair]] enacted policies based on the free market economy to deliver public services via the [[private finance initiative]].

It believes that, by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create, for each of us, the means to realise our true potential, and, for all of us, a community in which power, wealth, and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |title=Labour Party Clause Four |publisher=Labour.org.uk |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711081023/http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |archivedate=11 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Contemporary socialist politics ==\n[[File:1989 CPA 6101.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kwame Nkrumah]], the first [[president of Ghana]] and theorist of [[African socialism]], on a [[Soviet Union]] commemorative postage stamp]]\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{main|African socialism}}\nAfrican socialism has been and continues to be a major ideology around the continent.

Essentially he believed Africans were already socialists. Other African socialists include [[Jomo Kenyatta]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. [[Fela Kuti]] was inspired by socialism and called for a democratic African republic. In South Africa the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) abandoned its partial socialist allegiances after taking power and followed a standard neoliberal route. From 2005 through to 2007, the country was wracked by many thousands of protests from poor communities.

There are two major types of planning: decentralised-planning and centralised-planning. [[Enrico Barone]] provided a comprehensive theoretical framework for a planned socialist economy. In his model, assuming perfect computation techniques, simultaneous equations relating inputs and outputs to ratios of equivalence would provide appropriate valuations in order to balance supply and demand.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gregory and Stuart |first=Paul and Robert |title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century, Seventh Edition |publisher=George Hoffman |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-618-26181-9 |pages=120\u201321}}</ref>\n\nThe most prominent example of a planned economy was the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economic system of the Soviet Union]] and as such the centralised-planned economic model is usually associated with the [[communist state]]s of the 20th century, where it was combined with a single-party political system. In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency (see also the [[analysis of Soviet-type economic planning]]). The economic systems of the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]] are further classified as \"command economies\", which are defined as systems where economic coordination is undertaken by commands, directives and production targets.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ericson |first=Richard E. |title=Command Economy |url=http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf |website= |access-date=9 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125010605/http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf |archive-date=25 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Studies by economists of various political persuasions on the actual functioning of the Soviet economy indicate that it was not actually a planned economy. Instead of conscious planning, the Soviet economy was based on a process whereby the plan was modified by localised agents and the original plans went largely unfulfilled. Planning agencies, ministries and enterprises all adapted and bargained with each other during the formulation of the plan as opposed to following a plan passed down from a higher authority, leading some economists to suggest that planning did not actually take place within the Soviet economy and that a better description would be an \"administered\" or \"managed\" economy.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nove |first=Alec |title=The Economics of Feasible Socialism, Revisited |publisher=Routledge |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-04-335049-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsoffeasi00nove/page/78 78] |quote=Several authors of the most diverse political views have stated that there is in fact no planning in the Soviet Union: Eugene Zaleski, J.

Leon Trotsky rejected central planning in favour of decentralised planning. He argued that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, would be unable to coordinate effectively all economic activity within an economy because they operated without the input and tacit knowledge embodied by the participation of the millions of people in the economy. As a result, central planners would be unable to respond to local economic conditions.<ref>''Writings 1932\u201333, p. 96'', Leon Trotsky.</ref> [[State socialism]] is unfeasible in this view because information cannot be aggregated by a central body and effectively used to formulate a plan for an entire economy, because doing so would result in [[Economic calculation problem|distorted or absent price signals]].<ref name=\"hayek\">F.

These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.\" [[Benjamin Tucker]].

Some democratic socialists support [[social democracy]] as a temporary measure to reform the current system while others reject reformism in favour of more revolutionary methods. Modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative modification of capitalism in order to make it more equitable and humane, while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is either completely forgotten or redefined in a pro-capitalist way. The two movements are widely similar both in terminology and in ideology, although there are a few key differences.\n\nThe major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics: contemporary social democrats support a [[welfare state]] and unemployment insurance as a means to \"humanise\" capitalism, whereas democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system, arguing that any attempt to \"humanise\" capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Democratic Socialism |website=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice |year=2006 |url=http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617235335/http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |archivedate=17 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} \"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state\u2014pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labour movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanised, and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere. (E.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labour discipline breaks down; etc.)\"</ref>\n\nDemocratic socialism generally refers to any political movement that seeks to establish an economy based on [[economic democracy]] by and for the working class. Democratic socialism is difficult to define and groups of scholars have radically different definitions for the term. Some definitions simply refer to all forms of socialism that follow an electoral, [[Reformism|reformist]] or evolutionary path to socialism rather than a revolutionary one.<ref>This definition is captured in this statement by [[Anthony Crosland]], who \"argued that the socialisms of the pre-war world (not just that of the [[Marxist]]s, but of the democratic socialists too) were now increasingly irrelevant\". {{cite journal |first=Chris |last=Pierson |title=Lost property: What the Third Way lacks |journal=Journal of Political Ideologies |date=June 2005 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=145\u201363 |doi=10.1080/13569310500097265}} Other texts which use the terms \"democratic socialism\" in this way include Malcolm Hamilton ''Democratic Socialism in Britain and Sweden'' (St Martin's Press 1989).</ref>\n\n{{quotation|You can't talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums.

The people were expected to play their part only at the moment of revolution. Preparation for the revolution concerned only the little group of revolutionists armed for the coup.

He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused and that \"affirming one's difference\" can actually enhance social integration.<ref>[[Charles Fourier]], ''Le Nouveau Monde amoureux'' (written 1816\u201318, not published widely until 1967: Paris: \u00c9ditions Anthropos). pp. 389, 391, 429, 458, 459, 462, and 463.</ref> In [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Soul of Man Under Socialism]]'', he passionately advocates for an [[egalitarian]] society where wealth is shared by all, while warning of the dangers of social systems that crush individuality. Wilde's [[libertarian socialist]] politics were shared by other figures who actively campaigned for homosexual emancipation in the late 19th century such as [[Edward Carpenter]].<ref>According to his biographer Neil McKenna, Wilde was part of a secret organisation that aimed to legalise homosexuality, and was known among the group as a leader of \"the Cause\".

An important early influence was the thought of the American [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] and his book ''[[Walden]]''<ref name=\"Thoreau\">\"Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html \"La Insumisi\u00f3n voluntaria.

[[Eduard Bernstein]] was a leading [[social democrat]] in Germany who proposed the concept of [[evolutionary socialism]]. Revolutionary socialists quickly targeted reformism: [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay ''[[Social Reform or Revolution]]?'' [[Revolutionary socialism]] encompasses multiple social and political movements that may define \"revolution\" differently. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) in Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe, despite working illegally until the anti-socialist laws were dropped in 1890. In the 1893 elections, it gained 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast, according to Engels.

In April of that year, [[Vladimir Lenin]], leader of the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|socialists in Russia]] and known for his [[Leninism|profound and controversial expansions]] of [[Marxism]], was allowed to cross Germany to return from exile in Switzerland.\n\nLenin had published [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|essays]] on his analysis of [[Leninism#Imperialism|imperialism]], the monopoly and [[globalisation]] phase of capitalism, as well as analyses on social conditions. He observed that as capitalism had further developed in Europe and America, the workers remained unable to gain [[class consciousness]] so long as they were too busy working to pay their expenses. He therefore proposed that the social revolution would require the leadership of a [[vanguard party]] of class-conscious revolutionaries from the educated and politically active part of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ess_leninscritique.html |title=Commanding Heights: Lenin's Critique of Global Capitalism |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nUpon arriving in [[Petrograd]], Lenin declared that the revolution in Russia had only begun, and that the next step was for the workers' [[soviet (council)|soviet]]s to take full authority. He issued a [[April Thesis|thesis]] outlining the Bolshevik programme, including rejection of any legitimacy in the provisional government and advocacy for state power to be administered through the soviets. The Bolsheviks became the most influential force. On 7 November, the [[Winter Palace|capitol of the provisional government]] was stormed by [[Red Guards (Russia)|Bolshevik Red Guards]] in what afterwards became known as the [[Great October Socialist Revolution]]. The provisional government ended and the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]]\u2014the world's first constitutionally socialist state\u2014was established.

Influential in these policies was the idea of a \"[[Third Way]]\" which called for a re-evaluation of welfare state policies.<ref>Jane Lewis, Rebecca Surender. ''Welfare State Change: Towards a Third Way?''. Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 3\u20134, 16.</ref> In 1995, the Labour Party re-defined its stance on socialism by re-wording [[Clause IV]] of its constitution, effectively rejecting socialism by removing all references to public, direct worker or municipal ownership of the means of production. The Labour Party stated: \"The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that, by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create, for each of us, the means to realise our true potential, and, for all of us, a community in which power, wealth, and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |title=Labour Party Clause Four |publisher=Labour.org.uk |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711081023/http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |archivedate=11 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Contemporary socialist politics ==\n[[File:1989 CPA 6101.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kwame Nkrumah]], the first [[president of Ghana]] and theorist of [[African socialism]], on a [[Soviet Union]] commemorative postage stamp]]\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{main|African socialism}}\nAfrican socialism has been and continues to be a major ideology around the continent.

Essentially he believed Africans were already socialists. Other African socialists include [[Jomo Kenyatta]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. [[Fela Kuti]] was inspired by socialism and called for a democratic African republic. In South Africa the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) abandoned its partial socialist allegiances after taking power and followed a standard neoliberal route. From 2005 through to 2007, the country was wracked by many thousands of protests from poor communities. One of these gave rise to a mass movement of shack dwellers, [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] that despite major police suppression continues to work for popular people's planning and against the creation of a market economy in land and housing.\n\n=== Asia ===\n{{main|Arab socialism|History of the People's Republic of China|Socialist market economy|Socialist-oriented market economy}}\nIn Asia, states with socialist economies\u2014such as the People's Republic of China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam\u2014have largely moved away from centralised economic planning in the 21st century, placing a greater emphasis on markets.

In contrast to Marx, Lassalle rejected the concept of the state as a class-based power structure whose main function was to preserve existing class structures. Lassalle also rejected the Marxist view that the state would \"wither away\". Lassalle considered the state to be an entity independent of class allegiances and an instrument of justice that was essential for achieving socialism.{{Sfn | Berlau | 1949 | p = 21}}\n\nPreceding the Russian revolution, socialists including [[Reformism|reformists]], [[orthodox Marxist]] currents such as [[council communism]], anarchists and [[libertarian socialists]] criticised the idea of using the state to conduct central planning and own the means of production as a way to establish socialism. The idea of [[state socialism]] spread rapidly throughout the socialist movement and eventually came to be identified with the [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet economic model]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Screpanti and Zamagni|title=An Outline on the History of Economic Thought |edition=2nd |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford|quote=It should not be forgotten, however, that in the period of the Second International, some of the reformist currents of Marxism, as well as some of the extreme left-wing ones, not to speak of the anarchist groups, had already criticised the view that State ownership and central planning is the best road to socialism. But with the victory of Leninism in Russia, all dissent was silenced, and socialism became identified with 'democratic centralism', 'central planning', and State ownership of the means of production. |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/0199279144.001.0001|isbn=978-0-19-927914-2|p=295|ref=p. 295}}</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Schumpeter]] rejected the association of socialism with state ownership because the state is a product of capitalist society and cannot be transplanted to a different institutional framework.

The state, along with concepts like [[Private property|property]] and [[taxation]], were concepts exclusive to capitalism.

A socialist form of organisation would eliminate controlling hierarchies so that only a hierarchy based on technical knowledge in the workplace remains.

There are two major types of planning: decentralised-planning and centralised-planning. [[Enrico Barone]] provided a comprehensive theoretical framework for a planned socialist economy. In his model, assuming perfect computation techniques, simultaneous equations relating inputs and outputs to ratios of equivalence would provide appropriate valuations in order to balance supply and demand.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gregory and Stuart |first=Paul and Robert |title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century, Seventh Edition |publisher=George Hoffman |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-618-26181-9 |pages=120\u201321}}</ref>\n\nThe most prominent example of a planned economy was the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economic system of the Soviet Union]] and as such the centralised-planned economic model is usually associated with the [[communist state]]s of the 20th century, where it was combined with a single-party political system. In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency (see also the [[analysis of Soviet-type economic planning]]). The economic systems of the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]] are further classified as \"command economies\", which are defined as systems where economic coordination is undertaken by commands, directives and production targets.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ericson |first=Richard E. |title=Command Economy |url=http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf |website= |access-date=9 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125010605/http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf |archive-date=25 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Studies by economists of various political persuasions on the actual functioning of the Soviet economy indicate that it was not actually a planned economy.

It is a system that uses the market and [[Price system|monetary prices]] for the allocation and accounting of the [[means of production]], thereby retaining the process of [[capital accumulation]]. The profit generated would be used to directly remunerate employees, collectively sustain the enterprise or finance public institutions.<ref>''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}. p. 142: \"It is an economic system that combines social ownership of capital with market allocation of capital...The state owns the means of production, and returns accrue to society at large.\"</ref> In state-oriented forms of market socialism, in which state enterprises attempt to maximise profit, the profits can be used to fund government programs and services through a [[social dividend]], eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems. [[Neoclassical economist]] [[L\u00e9on Walras]] believed that a socialist economy based on state ownership of land and natural resources would provide a means of public finance to make income taxes unnecessary.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bockman |first=Johanna |title=Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-8047-7566-3 |page=21 |quote=For Walras, socialism would provide the necessary institutions for free competition and social justice. Socialism, in Walras's view, entailed state ownership of land and natural resources and the abolition of income taxes. As owner of land and natural resources, the state could then lease these resources to many individuals and groups, which would eliminate monopolies and thus enable free competition. The leasing of land and natural resources would also provide enough state revenue to make income taxes unnecessary, allowing a worker to invest his savings and become 'an owner or capitalist at the same time that he remains a worker.}}</ref> Yugoslavia implemented a market socialist economy based on cooperatives and worker self-management.\n\n[[File:Proudhon-children.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], main theorist of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and influential French socialist thinker]]\n[[Mutualism (economy)|Mutualism]] is an [[Economics|economic theory]] and [[anarchist school of thought]] that advocates a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labour in the [[free market]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mutualist.org/ |title=Introduction |publisher=Mutualist.org |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration.<ref>Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought.

These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity.

Some democratic socialists support [[social democracy]] as a temporary measure to reform the current system while others reject reformism in favour of more revolutionary methods. Modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative modification of capitalism in order to make it more equitable and humane, while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is either completely forgotten or redefined in a pro-capitalist way. The two movements are widely similar both in terminology and in ideology, although there are a few key differences.\n\nThe major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics: contemporary social democrats support a [[welfare state]] and unemployment insurance as a means to \"humanise\" capitalism, whereas democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system, arguing that any attempt to \"humanise\" capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Democratic Socialism |website=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice |year=2006 |url=http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617235335/http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |archivedate=17 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} \"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state\u2014pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance.

Democratic socialism is difficult to define and groups of scholars have radically different definitions for the term. Some definitions simply refer to all forms of socialism that follow an electoral, [[Reformism|reformist]] or evolutionary path to socialism rather than a revolutionary one.<ref>This definition is captured in this statement by [[Anthony Crosland]], who \"argued that the socialisms of the pre-war world (not just that of the [[Marxist]]s, but of the democratic socialists too) were now increasingly irrelevant\". {{cite journal |first=Chris |last=Pierson |title=Lost property: What the Third Way lacks |journal=Journal of Political Ideologies |date=June 2005 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=145\u201363 |doi=10.1080/13569310500097265}} Other texts which use the terms \"democratic socialism\" in this way include Malcolm Hamilton ''Democratic Socialism in Britain and Sweden'' (St Martin's Press 1989).</ref>\n\n{{quotation|You can't talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums.

De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural.

Williams set multiple national and regional swimming records in her late teens as part of the [[Los Angeles Athletic Club]] swim team. Unable to compete in the [[1940 Summer Olympics]] because of the outbreak of World War II, she joined [[Billy Rose's Aquacade]], where she took on the role vacated by [[Eleanor Holm]] after the show's move from New York City to San Francisco. While in the city, she spent five months swimming alongside Olympic gold medal winner and ''Tarzan'' star [[Johnny Weissmuller]].<ref name=\"LAtimes1940-05-13\"/> Williams caught the attention of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] scouts at the Aquacade. After appearing in several small roles, alongside [[Mickey Rooney]] in an [[Andy Hardy]] film, and future five-time co-star [[Van Johnson]] in ''[[A Guy Named Joe]]'', Williams made a series of films in the 1940s and early 1950s known as \"aquamusicals,\" which featured elaborate performances with [[synchronised swimming]] and diving. She was one of most beautiful Hollywood stars of the all time.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1949, Williams had at least one film listed among the 20 highest-grossing films of the year.<ref name=\"BOR1945\"/><ref name=\"BOR1946\"/><ref name=\"BOR1947\"/><ref name=\"BOR1948\"/><ref name=\"BOR1949\"/> In 1952, Williams appeared in her only biographical role, as Australian swimming star [[Annette Kellermann|Annette Kellerman]] in ''[[Million Dollar Mermaid]]'', which went on to become her nickname while at MGM.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=285}} Williams left MGM in 1956 and appeared in a handful of unsuccessful feature films, followed by several extremely popular water-themed network television specials, including one from [[Cypress Gardens, Florida]].\n\nWilliams was also a successful businesswoman. Even before retiring as an actress, she invested in a \"service station, a metal products plant, a manufacturer of bathing suits, various properties and a successful restaurant chain known as Trails.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Esther Williams|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=June 6, 2013|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10104714/Esther-Williams.html|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref> She lent her name to a line of swimming pools and retro [[swimwear]], instructional swimming videos for children, and served as a commentator for [[Synchronized swimming at the 1984 Summer Olympics|synchronized swimming]] at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles.\n\n==Early years==\nWilliams was born on August 8, 1921, in [[Inglewood, California]].<ref name=\"AP2006-10-25-ABC\"/><ref name=\"CABI\"/> She was the fifth and youngest child of Louis Stanton Williams (January 19, 1886 &nbsp;\u2013 June 10, 1968) and Bula Myrtle (n\u00e9e Gilpin; October 8, 1885&nbsp;\u2013 December 29, 1971).{{sfn|L.A. Times|01/02/72|pp=A6}} Louis was a sign painter and Bula was a psychologist. The two lived on neighboring farms in Kansas and carried on a nine-year courtship until June 1, 1908, when they eloped and set off for California. However, they ran out of money in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], and settled there. Esther's brother, Stanton (September 4, 1912&nbsp;\u2013 March 3, 1929) was discovered by actress [[Marjorie Rambeau]], which led to the family (including sisters Maurine and June and brother David) moving to the Los Angeles area to be near the studios. Louis Williams purchased a small piece of land in the southwest area of town, and had a small house built there. Esther was born in the living room, which was also where the family slept, until Louis Williams was able to add bedrooms. In 1929, Stanton Williams died after his colon burst.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=22}}\n\nIn 1935, Bula Myrtle Williams invited 16-year-old Buddy McClure to live with her family. McClure had recently lost his mother and Bula was still grieving over the death of her son. Esther recounted in her autobiography that one night, when the rest of the family was visiting relatives in [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]], McClure raped her. She was terrified to tell anyone about the incident and waited two years before finally revealing the truth to her parents. Williams' mother seemed unsure about her story, claiming McClure was \"sensitive\" and was sympathetic towards him when he admitted his guilt. Bula Williams then banished him from her home, McClure joined the [[United States Coast Guard]], and Williams never saw him again.{{sfn|Williams|1999|pp=24\u201328}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Competitive swimming===\n[[File:Esther Williams, posing in a swim suit in Los Angeles, Calif, 1939.jpg|thumb|upright|Williams at the [[Los Angeles Athletic Club|L.A.

At this point, Williams had achieved pin-up status because of the number of photographs of her in bathing suits.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=101}} To prepare, Williams and her publicity assistant would listen to [[Bob Hope]] and [[Jack Benny]]'s radio programs, retelling the funniest jokes while at the hospitals. Williams also invited GIs to dance with her on stage and take part in mock screen tests. The men would receive a card telling them their lines, and they would act out the scene in front of the other soldiers. These tests were always romantic scenes to which the men were required to refuse multiple times. When the men said the final, \"No\", Williams would pull at her tear-away skirt and sweater leaving nothing but a gold lam\u00e9 swimsuit. The scenes would always end with the men giving in and kissing her after that stunt.{{sfn|Wayne|2003|p=103}} Her hospital tours continued into the 1950s.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=102}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Unexpected Pleasure|first=Hedda|last=Hopper|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 18, 1951|page=2|id={{ProQuest|166244192}}}} Staff Sgt.

This was her first Technicolor musical. The studio changed the title of the film to showcase Williams. Almost all of the film's posters featured Williams in a bathing suit, though the swimming sequences make up a small portion of the film. Her date to the premiere at the Astor Theater in New York City was future husband [[Ben Gage]]. For the event, MGM publicity set up a six-story-tall billboard of Williams diving into Times Square with a large sign that said \"Come on in!

The studio's publicity department tried to put the two together in public as much as possible in the hopes of encouraging a romance, even though Williams was involved with Gage at the time.

Audiences, and Williams, thought the film was silly, as Williams and Montalb\u00e1n had vastly different accents. Montalb\u00e1n was born in Mexico and was a native Spanish speaker while Williams had a mid-western accent picked up from her Kansas-born parents. Production was difficult with a multitude of problems. By 1947, Gage and Williams were married. Gage had traveled to Mexico for the making of the film. He got into a fight with an employee of the cast's hotel, was arrested, and subsequently thrown out of the country.{{sfn|Wayne|2003|p=381}}The director of photography, Sidney Wagner, and one other crew member died of [[cholera]] from eating contaminated street food. Many of the film's stuntmen were sent to the hospital after being gored by bulls.

In 1948, Williams signed a contract with swimwear company Cole of California to appear as their spokesperson, and Williams and the other swimmers in her films wore Cole swimsuits. Since the aqua-musicals were an entirely new genre, the studio's costume designers had little experience creating practical swimsuits.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=104}} William's plaid flannel swimsuit for ''This Time for Keeps'' was so heavy that she was dragged to the bottom of the pool, and had to unzip the suit, swimming naked to the edge of the pool to avoid drowning. Cole swimsuits used latex, which meant zippers were no longer necessary. While filming ''Skirts Ahoy'' (1952), Williams discovered that members of the [[WAVES]] program received thin, cotton, shapeless swimsuits as part of their uniforms. Williams modeled a Cole swimsuit for the [[Secretary of the Navy]] and explained that the new swimsuits helped support women's figures. The United States Navy ordered 50,000 suits immediately.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=205}}\n\nFilming ''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game (film)|Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]'' (1949)  was, according to Williams in her autobiography, an experience of \"pure misery\". A period musical starring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], the two male leads' characters were players in a baseball team owned by K.C. Higgins, Williams's role. She claimed that Kelly and co-writer [[Stanley Donen]] treated her with contempt and went out of their way to make jokes at her expense. The film was well-received critically and became a major commercial success, raking in $3.4 million in rentals and becoming the 11th highest earning film of the year.<ref name=\"BOR1949\" /> Williams made ''[[Neptune's Daughter (1949 film)|Neptune's Daughter]]'' (also 1949) around the same time with co-stars Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n, Red Skelton and [[Betty Garrett]], who had also been in ''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]].'' {{sfn|Williams|1999|p=152}} In the film, Williams sings \"[[Baby, It's Cold Outside]]\" with Montalb\u00e1n. The song won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] at the [[22nd Academy Awards]]. Williams and Montalb\u00e1n were originally slated to sing \"[[(I'd Like to Get You on a) Slow Boat to China]]\", but studio censors thought the song was too sexual (interpreting the word \"get\" as \"have\") and instead gave them \"Baby, It's Cold Outside.\"<ref name=\"1999 NYT Interview\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/02/garden/at-home-with-esther-williams-swimming-upstream.html?scp=16&sq=esther%20williams&st=cse&pagewanted=2 1999 New York Times Interview].</ref> ''Neptune's Daughter'' became the 10th highest-grossing film of 1949.<ref name=\"BOR1949\"/>\n\n===1950s===\n[[File:Esther Williams in Million Dollar Mermaid trailer.jpg|thumb|left|Williams as [[Annette Kellermann]] in ''[[Million Dollar Mermaid]]'']]\nWilliams made ''[[Duchess of Idaho]]'' (1950), shot on location in [[Sun Valley, Idaho]], co-starring [[Van Johnson]].<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=654&category=Notes TCM Database listing for ''Duchess of Idaho''].</ref> MGM paired her with [[Howard Keel]] for three films, ''[[Pagan Love Song]]'' (also 1950), ''Texas Carnival (1951'') and later ''[[Jupiter's Darling (film)|Jupiter's Darling]]'' (1955).

She subsequently recovered, although she continued to suffer headaches as a result of the accident. Her many hours spent submerged in a studio tank resulted in ruptured [[eardrum]]s numerous times. She also nearly drowned after not being able to find the trapdoor in the ceiling of a tank. The walls and ceiling were painted black and the trapdoor blended in. Williams was pulled out only because a member of the crew realized the door was not opening.\n\n===After MGM===\nAfter 15 years of appearing in films, Williams was threatened with contract suspension from MGM after refusing the lead role in ''[[The Opposite Sex]]'' (eventually released in 1956), a musical remake of 1939's ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]''. The role of Mary would have been rewritten to be an aquacade star (and was eventually filled by [[June Allyson]] as \"Kay\", a nightclub singer). Williams redecorated her dressing room to accommodate returning star [[Grace Kelly]], packed her terry cloth robes and swimsuits and drove off the studio lot. As a result of leaving her contract, Williams lost almost $3 million in deferred contract payments, which had been taken from her paychecks over the previous 14 years and put aside as both a nest egg and a [[tax deferral]]. She was, however, still able to collect on the $50,000 signing bonus from when she first signed her contract.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=349}}\n\nIn 1956, she moved to [[Universal International]] and appeared in a non-musical dramatic film, ''[[The Unguarded Moment (film)|The Unguarded Moment]]'' (1956). After that, her film career slowly wound down. She later admitted that husband [[Fernando Lamas]] preferred her not to continue in films. She would, however, make occasional appearances on television, including mystery guest appearances for ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', and two aqua-specials, ''The Esther Williams Aqua Spectacle'' (1956) and ''Esther Williams at Cypress Gardens'' which was telecast on August 8, 1960.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o38TAAAAIBAJ&sjid=p4oDAAAAIBAJ&dq=esther%20williams&pg=2391%2C3728220 ([[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]) ''Free-Lane Star'', August 9, 1960].</ref> More than half of all television sets in use in the United States were tuned in to watch the ''Cypress Gardens'' special.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=324}} She starred in an aqua-special at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in London.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=285}} In 1966, Williams was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame.{{sfn|Sherrow|1996|p=333}}\n\n==Later years==\nWilliams retired from acting in the early 1960s and later turned down the role of Belle Rosen, a character with a crucial swimming scene, in ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]].'' (The role eventually went to [[Shelley Winters]].) She continued to lend her name to a line of retro women's [[swimwear]]. \"Women worldwide are fighting a thing called gravity,\" said Williams. \"I say to women when I talk to them, 'You girls of 18 have until about 25, 30 at the most, and then you have to report to me. My suits are quality fabric.'\"<ref name=\"1999 NYT Interview\"/> She went on: \"I put you in a suit that contains you and you will swim in.

Grant said that, with the help of LSD, he had \"found that [he] had a tough inner core of strength\", and that when he was young, he \"was very dependent upon older men and women. Now, people [came] to [him] for help.\" Williams stated that she wanted to be one of those people. As she said in ''Million Dollar Mermaid'', \"At that point, I really didn't know who I was. Was I that glamorous femme fatale?... Was I just another broken-down divorc\u00e9e whose husband left her with all the bills and three kids?\" Shortly after reading the article, she contacted Grant.

2013) was an American competitive swimmer and actress. Williams set multiple national and regional swimming records in her late teens as part of the [[Los Angeles Athletic Club]] swim team. Unable to compete in the [[1940 Summer Olympics]] because of the outbreak of World War II, she joined [[Billy Rose's Aquacade]], where she took on the role vacated by [[Eleanor Holm]] after the show's move from New York City to San Francisco. While in the city, she spent five months swimming alongside Olympic gold medal winner and ''Tarzan'' star [[Johnny Weissmuller]].<ref name=\"LAtimes1940-05-13\"/> Williams caught the attention of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] scouts at the Aquacade. After appearing in several small roles, alongside [[Mickey Rooney]] in an [[Andy Hardy]] film, and future five-time co-star [[Van Johnson]] in ''[[A Guy Named Joe]]'', Williams made a series of films in the 1940s and early 1950s known as \"aquamusicals,\" which featured elaborate performances with [[synchronised swimming]] and diving.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1949, Williams had at least one film listed among the 20 highest-grossing films of the year.<ref name=\"BOR1945\"/><ref name=\"BOR1946\"/><ref name=\"BOR1947\"/><ref name=\"BOR1948\"/><ref name=\"BOR1949\"/> In 1952, Williams appeared in her only biographical role, as Australian swimming star [[Annette Kellermann|Annette Kellerman]] in ''[[Million Dollar Mermaid]]'', which went on to become her nickname while at MGM.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=285}} Williams left MGM in 1956 and appeared in a handful of unsuccessful feature films, followed by several extremely popular water-themed network television specials, including one from [[Cypress Gardens, Florida]].\n\nWilliams was also a successful businesswoman. Even before retiring as an actress, she invested in a \"service station, a metal products plant, a manufacturer of bathing suits, various properties and a successful restaurant chain known as Trails.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Esther Williams|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=June 6, 2013|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10104714/Esther-Williams.html|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref> She lent her name to a line of swimming pools and retro [[swimwear]], instructional swimming videos for children, and served as a commentator for [[Synchronized swimming at the 1984 Summer Olympics|synchronized swimming]] at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles.\n\n==Early years==\nWilliams was born on August 8, 1921, in [[Inglewood, California]].<ref name=\"AP2006-10-25-ABC\"/><ref name=\"CABI\"/> She was the fifth and youngest child of Louis Stanton Williams (January 19, 1886 &nbsp;\u2013 June 10, 1968) and Bula Myrtle (n\u00e9e Gilpin; October 8, 1885&nbsp;\u2013 December 29, 1971).{{sfn|L.A. Times|01/02/72|pp=A6}} Louis was a sign painter and Bula was a psychologist. The two lived on neighboring farms in Kansas and carried on a nine-year courtship until June 1, 1908, when they eloped and set off for California. However, they ran out of money in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], and settled there. Esther's brother, Stanton (September 4, 1912&nbsp;\u2013 March 3, 1929) was discovered by actress [[Marjorie Rambeau]], which led to the family (including sisters Maurine and June and brother David) moving to the Los Angeles area to be near the studios. Louis Williams purchased a small piece of land in the southwest area of town, and had a small house built there. Esther was born in the living room, which was also where the family slept, until Louis Williams was able to add bedrooms. In 1929, Stanton Williams died after his colon burst.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=22}}\n\nIn 1935, Bula Myrtle Williams invited 16-year-old Buddy McClure to live with her family. McClure had recently lost his mother and Bula was still grieving over the death of her son. Esther recounted in her autobiography that one night, when the rest of the family was visiting relatives in [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]], McClure raped her. She was terrified to tell anyone about the incident and waited two years before finally revealing the truth to her parents. Williams' mother seemed unsure about her story, claiming McClure was \"sensitive\" and was sympathetic towards him when he admitted his guilt. Bula Williams then banished him from her home, McClure joined the [[United States Coast Guard]], and Williams never saw him again.{{sfn|Williams|1999|pp=24\u201328}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Competitive swimming===\n[[File:Esther Williams, posing in a swim suit in Los Angeles, Calif, 1939.jpg|thumb|upright|Williams at the [[Los Angeles Athletic Club|L.A.

MGM's head, [[Louis B. Mayer]], had been looking for a female sports star for the studio to compete with [[20th Century Fox|Fox]]'s figure skating star, [[Sonja Henie]].{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=57}} Williams signed her contract with MGM in 1941. {{sfn|Wayne|2003|p=380}}\n\nIn her contract were two clauses: the first being that she receive a guest pass to [[The Beverly Hills Hotel]] where she could swim in the pool every day, and the second that she would not appear on camera for nine months to allow for acting, singing, dancing, and diction lessons. Williams wrote in her autobiography, \"If it took nine months for a baby to be born, I figured my 'birth' from Esther Williams the swimmer to Esther Williams the movie actress would not be much different.\"{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=73}}\n\n[[File:Esther Williams 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[pin-up]] of Williams from a 1945 issue of ''[[Yank, the Army Weekly]]'']]\n\nWhile top stars at the studios such as [[Judy Garland]], [[Betty Grable]], and [[Shirley Temple]] took part in [[War bond|bond tours]] during the war, Williams was asked to take in hospital tours. At this point, Williams had achieved pin-up status because of the number of photographs of her in bathing suits.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=101}} To prepare, Williams and her publicity assistant would listen to [[Bob Hope]] and [[Jack Benny]]'s radio programs, retelling the funniest jokes while at the hospitals. Williams also invited GIs to dance with her on stage and take part in mock screen tests. The men would receive a card telling them their lines, and they would act out the scene in front of the other soldiers. These tests were always romantic scenes to which the men were required to refuse multiple times. When the men said the final, \"No\", Williams would pull at her tear-away skirt and sweater leaving nothing but a gold lam\u00e9 swimsuit. The scenes would always end with the men giving in and kissing her after that stunt.{{sfn|Wayne|2003|p=103}} Her hospital tours continued into the 1950s.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=102}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Unexpected Pleasure|first=Hedda|last=Hopper|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 18, 1951|page=2|id={{ProQuest|166244192}}}} Staff Sgt.

According to Williams's autobiography, the studio used this test to get Lana Turner back in line with the terms of her contract and as a punishment for when [[Lana Turner]] eloped with [[Artie Shaw|Artie]] Shaw\ufffc\ufffc. Williams screen tested with the leading man, [[Clark Gable]], for the film ''[[Somewhere I'll Find You]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hedda Hopper's Hollywood|first=Hedda|last=Hopper|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 15, 1942|page=C3}}</ref> However, when Turner divorced Shaw after four months of marriage, she rejoined the film.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=94}} Following several short subject films, Williams appeared as Sheila Brooks in ''[[Andy Hardy's Double Life]]''.

It was here she first worked with [[Van Johnson]], with whom she would partner in five films.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=120}}\n\n''[[Bathing Beauty]]'', previously titled ''Mr. Coed'', starred [[Red Skelton]] as a man who enrolls in a women's college to win back his swimming instructor fianc\u00e9e, played by Williams. This was her first Technicolor musical. The studio changed the title of the film to showcase Williams. Almost all of the film's posters featured Williams in a bathing suit, though the swimming sequences make up a small portion of the film. Her date to the premiere at the Astor Theater in New York City was future husband [[Ben Gage]]. For the event, MGM publicity set up a six-story-tall billboard of Williams diving into Times Square with a large sign that said \"Come on in! The story's fine!\"{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=116}}\n\n[[File:Thrillofaromance-esthervancharleton.jpg|thumb|left| Williams, [[Van Johnson]] and [[Carleton G.

''Thrill of a Romance'' was the 8th highest-grossing film of 1945.<ref name=\"BOR1945\"/> Williams had to help Johnson swim, and she placed her hand under his back to keep him afloat. The studio's publicity department tried to put the two together in public as much as possible in the hopes of encouraging a romance, even though Williams was involved with Gage at the time.

Audiences, and Williams, thought the film was silly, as Williams and Montalb\u00e1n had vastly different accents. Montalb\u00e1n was born in Mexico and was a native Spanish speaker while Williams had a mid-western accent picked up from her Kansas-born parents. Production was difficult with a multitude of problems. By 1947, Gage and Williams were married. Gage had traveled to Mexico for the making of the film. He got into a fight with an employee of the cast's hotel, was arrested, and subsequently thrown out of the country.{{sfn|Wayne|2003|p=381}}The director of photography, Sidney Wagner, and one other crew member died of [[cholera]] from eating contaminated street food. Many of the film's stuntmen were sent to the hospital after being gored by bulls. Director [[Richard Thorpe|Dick Thorpe]] hadn't wanted the bulls killed (as they usually were at the end of a bullfight) because he believed them to be too expensive to replace.{{sfn|Williams|1999|pp=137\u2013146}}\n\nAfter filming was completed on ''Fiesta'', Williams appeared in the romance ''[[This Time for Keeps]]'' (1947) with singer [[Johnnie Johnston]]. In 1948, Williams signed a contract with swimwear company Cole of California to appear as their spokesperson, and Williams and the other swimmers in her films wore Cole swimsuits. Since the aqua-musicals were an entirely new genre, the studio's costume designers had little experience creating practical swimsuits.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=104}} William's plaid flannel swimsuit for ''This Time for Keeps'' was so heavy that she was dragged to the bottom of the pool, and had to unzip the suit, swimming naked to the edge of the pool to avoid drowning. Cole swimsuits used latex, which meant zippers were no longer necessary. While filming ''Skirts Ahoy'' (1952), Williams discovered that members of the [[WAVES]] program received thin, cotton, shapeless swimsuits as part of their uniforms. Williams modeled a Cole swimsuit for the [[Secretary of the Navy]] and explained that the new swimsuits helped support women's figures. The United States Navy ordered 50,000 suits immediately.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=205}}\n\nFilming ''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game (film)|Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]'' (1949)  was, according to Williams in her autobiography, an experience of \"pure misery\". A period musical starring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], the two male leads' characters were players in a baseball team owned by K.C. Higgins, Williams's role. She claimed that Kelly and co-writer [[Stanley Donen]] treated her with contempt and went out of their way to make jokes at her expense. The film was well-received critically and became a major commercial success, raking in $3.4 million in rentals and becoming the 11th highest earning film of the year.<ref name=\"BOR1949\" /> Williams made ''[[Neptune's Daughter (1949 film)|Neptune's Daughter]]'' (also 1949) around the same time with co-stars Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n, Red Skelton and [[Betty Garrett]], who had also been in ''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]].'' {{sfn|Williams|1999|p=152}} In the film, Williams sings \"[[Baby, It's Cold Outside]]\" with Montalb\u00e1n.

Williams and Montalb\u00e1n were originally slated to sing \"[[(I'd Like to Get You on a) Slow Boat to China]]\", but studio censors thought the song was too sexual (interpreting the word \"get\" as \"have\") and instead gave them \"Baby, It's Cold Outside.\"<ref name=\"1999 NYT Interview\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/02/garden/at-home-with-esther-williams-swimming-upstream.html?scp=16&sq=esther%20williams&st=cse&pagewanted=2 1999 New York Times Interview].</ref> ''Neptune's Daughter'' became the 10th highest-grossing film of 1949.<ref name=\"BOR1949\"/>\n\n===1950s===\n[[File:Esther Williams in Million Dollar Mermaid trailer.jpg|thumb|left|Williams as [[Annette Kellermann]] in ''[[Million Dollar Mermaid]]'']]\nWilliams made ''[[Duchess of Idaho]]'' (1950), shot on location in [[Sun Valley, Idaho]], co-starring [[Van Johnson]].<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=654&category=Notes TCM Database listing for ''Duchess of Idaho''].</ref> MGM paired her with [[Howard Keel]] for three films, ''[[Pagan Love Song]]'' (also 1950), ''Texas Carnival (1951'') and later ''[[Jupiter's Darling (film)|Jupiter's Darling]]'' (1955).

Williams often called this her favorite film, and named her autobiography after it.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=1}} Williams also won the ''Henrietta Award'' at the 1952 [[Golden Globes]], for World Film Favorite&nbsp;\u2013 Female.<ref>{{cite news |title=Esther Williams, Alan Ladd Get Movie Henriettas |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=January 27, 1952 |page=B1}}</ref> ''[[Easy to Love (1953 film)|Easy to Love]]'' (1953), also with Van Johnson, was filmed on location in [[Cypress Gardens]], where a swimming pool in the shape of the state of [[Florida]] had been built specifically for the film.

During casting, Lamas told Williams he did not want to star in the film with her because he only wanted to be involved in \"important pictures\". His part had to be rewritten to persuade him to take part in the film. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nIn 1953, Williams had been on maternity leave for three months while pregnant with daughter Susan, and assumed she would go straight to work on the film ''[[Athena (film)|Athena]]'' when she returned.<ref>{{cite news|title='Athena' Announced for Esther Williams|first=Hedda|last=Hopper|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 7, 1953|page=8}}</ref> However, production started without her, and the studio cast [[Jane Powell]] in the lead role,<ref>{{cite news|title=Drama|first=Edwin|last=Schallert|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 6, 1954|page=B7}}</ref> rewriting much of the premise that Williams and writers Leo Pogostin and [[Charles Walters|Chuck Walters]] had come up with.

Two more films were planned, ''Bermuda Encounter'' and ''Olympic Venus'', about the first Olympic swimmers; however, these were never made.<ref>{{cite news|title=Danny Thomas Set in 2D Jolson Role|date=November 29, 1952|newspaper=\"Los Angeles Times|page=12|id={{ProQuest|112236127}}}}</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DjITAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dgAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4302,1941143&dq=esther+williams&hl=en ''The Toledo Blade'', May 19, 1953].</ref><ref>[http://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_111547b/99 ''Box Office Barometer'', November 15, 1947] \"This states ''Olympic Venus'' as incomplete.\"</ref>\n\nMany of her MGM films, such as ''Million Dollar Mermaid'' and ''Jupiter's Darling'', contained elaborately staged synchronized swimming scenes, with considerable risk to Williams. She broke her neck filming a 115&nbsp;ft dive off a tower during a climactic musical number for the film ''Million Dollar Mermaid'' and was in a body cast for seven months. She subsequently recovered, although she continued to suffer headaches as a result of the accident. Her many hours spent submerged in a studio tank resulted in ruptured [[eardrum]]s numerous times. She also nearly drowned after not being able to find the trapdoor in the ceiling of a tank. The walls and ceiling were painted black and the trapdoor blended in. Williams was pulled out only because a member of the crew realized the door was not opening.\n\n===After MGM===\nAfter 15 years of appearing in films, Williams was threatened with contract suspension from MGM after refusing the lead role in ''[[The Opposite Sex]]'' (eventually released in 1956), a musical remake of 1939's ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]''. The role of Mary would have been rewritten to be an aquacade star (and was eventually filled by [[June Allyson]] as \"Kay\", a nightclub singer). Williams redecorated her dressing room to accommodate returning star [[Grace Kelly]], packed her terry cloth robes and swimsuits and drove off the studio lot. As a result of leaving her contract, Williams lost almost $3 million in deferred contract payments, which had been taken from her paychecks over the previous 14 years and put aside as both a nest egg and a [[tax deferral]]. She was, however, still able to collect on the $50,000 signing bonus from when she first signed her contract.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=349}}\n\nIn 1956, she moved to [[Universal International]] and appeared in a non-musical dramatic film, ''[[The Unguarded Moment (film)|The Unguarded Moment]]'' (1956). After that, her film career slowly wound down. She later admitted that husband [[Fernando Lamas]] preferred her not to continue in films. She would, however, make occasional appearances on television, including mystery guest appearances for ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', and two aqua-specials, ''The Esther Williams Aqua Spectacle'' (1956) and ''Esther Williams at Cypress Gardens'' which was telecast on August 8, 1960.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o38TAAAAIBAJ&sjid=p4oDAAAAIBAJ&dq=esther%20williams&pg=2391%2C3728220 ([[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]) ''Free-Lane Star'', August 9, 1960].</ref> More than half of all television sets in use in the United States were tuned in to watch the ''Cypress Gardens'' special.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=324}} She starred in an aqua-special at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in London.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=285}} In 1966, Williams was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame.{{sfn|Sherrow|1996|p=333}}\n\n==Later years==\nWilliams retired from acting in the early 1960s and later turned down the role of Belle Rosen, a character with a crucial swimming scene, in ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]].'' (The role eventually went to [[Shelley Winters]].) She continued to lend her name to a line of retro women's [[swimwear]]. \"Women worldwide are fighting a thing called gravity,\" said Williams. \"I say to women when I talk to them, 'You girls of 18 have until about 25, 30 at the most, and then you have to report to me. My suits are quality fabric.'\"<ref name=\"1999 NYT Interview\"/> She went on: \"I put you in a suit that contains you and you will swim in.
