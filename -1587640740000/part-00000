[[Schuylkill River]] approximately {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the [[Philadelphia]] city limits, Norristown has a population of 34,324 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. It is the fourth most populous municipality in the county and second most populous borough in Pennsylvania.<ref>Demographic and Information Packet, Montgomery County Planning Commission (MCPC),\nhttp://webapp.montcopa.org/planning/dataportal/pdfs/2012demogentiredocument.pdf, page 8.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe area where Norristown sits was originally owned by the family of [[Isaac Norris (statesman)|Isaac Norris]], who purchased the land from [[William Penn]] in 1704.\n[[File:Montgomery County Courthouse 2.JPG|thumb|left|Montgomery County Courthouse]]\nNamed the county seat in 1784 when Montgomery County was formed, Norristown was incorporated as a borough in 1812 and subsequently enlarged in 1853.  About 500 people lived there at the time of its incorporation.  Growing rapidly after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], it swelled to 22,265 people by 1900 and by 1940 it was home to 38,181 Norristonians, making it the most populous borough in Pennsylvania before declining in the decades after World War II.\n\nAt its height, Norristown was an industrial, retail, banking, and government center.  Breweries, cigar factories, textile mills, icehouses, foundries, rolling mills, and lumber yards provided ample employment for skilled laborers and artisans.<ref>Montgomery County Federation of Historical Societies, Montgomery County: The Second Hundred Years; Toll, Jean Barth and Michael J. Schwager, ed.;1983, pg. 464</ref>  The downtown featured two department stores, several theaters, and enough goods and services that residents never had to leave town to find anything they needed.<ref>Barth and Schwager, pg.463</ref>  Although primarily settled by the English and a handful of Germans, Scots, Dutch, and Swedes, in the mid-1800s the Irish began arriving in large numbers, followed by waves of Italians at the turn of the century.<ref>Barth and Schwager, pg. 469</ref>\n\nWith the opening of new malls in nearby [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania|King of Prussia]] and [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Meeting]], the downtown declined in the decades after [[World War II]].  Industry soon followed, as many companies closed or relocated into new industrial parks throughout Montgomery County.<ref>Barth and Schwager, pg. 465</ref>  Efforts to revitalize and reshape itself as a 21st-century community have produced minimal results.\n\n==Geography==\nNorristown is located in southeastern Pennsylvania, approximately {{convert|6|mi|0|abbr=on}}) northwest of Philadelphia. Totaling 3.519 square miles in land area, the municipality sits along the Schuylkill River.  Two major tributaries, the Stony Creek and the Saw Mill Run, bisect the town into thirds and empty directly into the Schuylkill.  The town\u2019s terrain is generally hilly, especially in the areas closest to downtown, which itself sits on a plateau surrounded by all three major waterways.\n\nNorristown has four distinct neighborhoods: the West End, the East End, the North End, and the downtown.\n\nIt is bounded by [[West Norriton Township, Pennsylvania|West Norriton]], [[East Norriton Township, Pennsylvania|East Norriton]], and [[Plymouth Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Plymouth]] townships, as well as the borough of [[Bridgeport, Pennsylvania|Bridgeport]].\n\nThe borough has a hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'') bordering closely upon a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''). The [[hardiness zone]] is 7a. Average monthly temperatures downtown range from 31.8\u00b0 F in January to 76.5\u00b0 F in July.

approximately {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the [[Philadelphia]] city limits, Norristown has a population of 34,324 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. It is the fourth most populous municipality in the county and second most populous borough in Pennsylvania.<ref>Demographic and Information Packet, Montgomery County Planning Commission (MCPC),\nhttp://webapp.montcopa.org/planning/dataportal/pdfs/2012demogentiredocument.pdf, page 8.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe area where Norristown sits was originally owned by the family of [[Isaac Norris (statesman)|Isaac Norris]], who purchased the land from [[William Penn]] in 1704.\n[[File:Montgomery County Courthouse 2.JPG|thumb|left|Montgomery County Courthouse]]\nNamed the county seat in 1784 when Montgomery County was formed, Norristown was incorporated as a borough in 1812 and subsequently enlarged in 1853.  About 500 people lived there at the time of its incorporation.  Growing rapidly after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], it swelled to 22,265 people by 1900 and by 1940 it was home to 38,181 Norristonians, making it the most populous borough in Pennsylvania before declining in the decades after World War II.\n\nAt its height, Norristown was an industrial, retail, banking, and government center.  Breweries, cigar factories, textile mills, icehouses, foundries, rolling mills, and lumber yards provided ample employment for skilled laborers and artisans.<ref>Montgomery County Federation of Historical Societies, Montgomery County: The Second Hundred Years; Toll, Jean Barth and Michael J. Schwager, ed.;1983, pg. 464</ref>  The downtown featured two department stores, several theaters, and enough goods and services that residents never had to leave town to find anything they needed.<ref>Barth and Schwager, pg.463</ref>  Although primarily settled by the English and a handful of Germans, Scots, Dutch, and Swedes, in the mid-1800s the Irish began arriving in large numbers, followed by waves of Italians at the turn of the century.<ref>Barth and Schwager, pg. 469</ref>\n\nWith the opening of new malls in nearby [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania|King of Prussia]] and [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Meeting]], the downtown declined in the decades after [[World War II]].  Industry soon followed, as many companies closed or relocated into new industrial parks throughout Montgomery County.<ref>Barth and Schwager, pg. 465</ref>  Efforts to revitalize and reshape itself as a 21st-century community have produced minimal results.\n\n==Geography==\nNorristown is located in southeastern Pennsylvania, approximately {{convert|6|mi|0|abbr=on}}) northwest of Philadelphia. Totaling 3.519 square miles in land area, the municipality sits along the Schuylkill River.  Two major tributaries, the Stony Creek and the Saw Mill Run, bisect the town into thirds and empty directly into the Schuylkill.  The town\u2019s terrain is generally hilly, especially in the areas closest to downtown, which itself sits on a plateau surrounded by all three major waterways.\n\nNorristown has four distinct neighborhoods: the West End, the East End, the North End, and the downtown.\n\nIt is bounded by [[West Norriton Township, Pennsylvania|West Norriton]], [[East Norriton Township, Pennsylvania|East Norriton]], and [[Plymouth Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Plymouth]] townships, as well as the borough of [[Bridgeport, Pennsylvania|Bridgeport]].\n\nThe borough has a hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'') bordering closely upon a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''). The [[hardiness zone]] is 7a. Average monthly temperatures downtown range from 31.8\u00b0 F in January to 76.5\u00b0 F in July.

The office of mayor was abolished in July 2004 after a public referendum amended the municipal charter. Executive and administrative authority is now delegated to a council appointed Municipal Manager.\n\nThe municipality is part of the [[Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district|Fourth Congressional District]] (represented by Rep.

Main Street (also known as [[Ridge Pike]] outside of the municipality) and Airy Street run east\u2013west through the downtown, eventually leading to interchanges for [[Interstate 476|I-476]] (the Blue Route) and the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 276|I-276]]), respectively, in [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Meeting]].  [[U.S. Route 202 in Pennsylvania|U.S. 202]] is the major north\u2013south route through the town, connecting it with other nearby county seats such as [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]] and [[West Chester, Pennsylvania|West Chester]].  U.S. 202 is split into a [[one-way pair]] through the municipality, as DeKalb St. is designated \u201cU.S. 202 North\u201d while Markley St. is signed \u201cU.S. 202 South.\u201d<ref name=adcmontgomery>{{cite map|publisher=[[ADC Map]]|title=Montgomery County, Pennsylvania |year=2006|edition=18th|scale= 1\"=2000'|isbn=0-87530-775-2}}</ref><ref name=gm>{{google maps|url=http://goo.gl/maps/sxSFr|title=overview of Norristown, Pennsylvania|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Norristown Transportation Center 10929518073.jpg|thumb|Norristown Transportation Center]]\nNorristown is the largest multi-modal transportation hub in Montgomery County.

[[SEPTA]] operates eight [[SEPTA Suburban Division bus routes|Suburban Division bus routes]] ({{SEPTA bus link|90|91|93|96|97|98|99}}, and {{SEPTA bus link|131}}), one interurban rapid transit route (the [[Norristown High Speed Line]] to [[69th Street Transportation Center]]), and a [[SEPTA Regional Rail|Regional Rail]] line (the [[Manayunk/Norristown Line]] to [[Center City Philadelphia]]) out of the NTC complex.\n\nThe regional rail station at the Norristown Transportation Center is one of three on the Manayunk/Norristown Line in Norristown.  The other two are [[Main Street, Norristown (SEPTA station)|Main Street]] and [[Elm Street, Norristown (SEPTA station)|Elm Street]], the latter of which serves as the terminus of the line.\n\nThe NTC contains a 522-space SEPTA commuter parking garage that also contains an intercity bus terminal that was formerly used by [[Bieber Transportation Group]], [[Greyhound Lines]], and [[Martz Trailways]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Philadelphia Schedule Update|publisher=Martz Group|date=May 29, 2018|url=https://martztrailways.com/philadelphia-schedule-update/|accessdate=September 11, 2019}}</ref> Several taxi companies and private bus shuttles have a presence at the Transportation Center.

In 2009, the historic former Bell Telephone building was completely renovated for offices, and that same year the U.S. Roofing Corporation rehabbed the former Conte Luna pasta factory on East Main Street to house their operations.  The former Sears building at the Studio Centre shopping center in the North End was renovated as a modern office center.\n\nSince the early 2000s, the Regatta Apartments, the Rittenhouse condominium building, and dozens of new townhouses have contributed to a residential boom in the East End.\n\nTwo new downtown parking garages were built in the late 2000s, one at Main and Cherry Streets for visitors and another at [[SEPTA]]\u2019s [[Norristown Transportation Center]] on Lafayette Street.  Several large downtown and neighborhood streetscape projects were completed by the municipal government to install new street lighting, trees, curbing, and sidewalks along Main Street, DeKalb Street, and Powell Street.\n\nThe Lafayette Street Extension Project, a $60 million effort now underway by Montgomery County, [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|PennDOT]], and the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA), will improve highway access and mobility into downtown Norristown by widening Lafayette Street and extending it eastward toward Ridge Pike and [[Conshohocken]], with eventual connections to the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] (I-276) and the [[US 202]] Dannehower Bridge.<ref>Montgomery County Planning Commission, Lafayette Street Extension Project website, http://www.lafayettestreetproject.com.</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[Norristown Area School District]] is the local school district.\n\nArea Catholic schools include Holy Rosary Regional Catholic School in [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Meeting]] and [[Plymouth Township, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Township]], and [[Mother Teresa]] Regional Catholic School in [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania|King of Prussia]].

This includes both crewed and robotic missions. The first human-made object to touch the Moon was the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Luna&nbsp;2]], on 13 September 1959.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1959-014A | title = Luna 2 | publisher = NASA\u2013NSSDC}}</ref>\n\nThe United States' [[Apollo 11]] was the first crewed mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/apollo11_40th.html NASA Apollo 11 40th anniversary].</ref> There were [[List of Apollo missions#Manned Apollo missions|six crewed U.S. landings]] between 1969 and 1972, and numerous uncrewed landings, with no [[Soft landing (aeronautics)|soft landings]] happening between 22 August 1976 and 14 December 2013.\n\nThe [[United States]] is the only country to have successfully conducted crewed missions to the Moon, with the last departing the lunar surface in December 1972. All [[Soft landing (aeronautics)|soft landings]] took place on the [[near side of the Moon]] until 3 January 2019, when the Chinese [[Chang'e 4]] spacecraft made the first landing on the [[far side of the Moon]].<ref name =\"far side of the moon\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/c4dc6858a32b4b61bdbc6aebf5459a91|title=Chinese spacecraft makes first landing on moon's far side|date=2019-01-03|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>\n\n== Uncrewed landings ==\nAfter the unsuccessful attempt by [[Luna 1]] to land on the Moon in 1959, the [[Soviet Union]] performed the first hard Moon landing \u2013 \"hard\" meaning the spacecraft intentionally crashes into the Moon \u2013 later that same year with the [[Luna 2]] spacecraft, a feat the U.S. duplicated in 1962 with [[Ranger 4]]. Since then, twelve Soviet and U.S. spacecraft have used braking rockets ([[retrorocket]]s) to make [[Soft landing (aeronautics)|soft landings]] and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface, between 1966 and 1976. In 1966 the USSR accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the [[Luna 9]] and [[Luna 13]] missions. The U.S. followed with five uncrewed [[Surveyor Program|Surveyor]] soft landings.\n\nThe Soviet Union achieved the first uncrewed lunar soil [[sample return mission|sample return]] with the [[Luna 16]] probe on 24 September 197O. This was followed by [[Luna 20]] and [[Luna 24]] in 1972 and 1976, respectively. Following the failure at launch in 1969 of the first [[Lunokhod]], [[Luna E-8 No.201]], the [[Luna 17]] and [[Luna 21]] were successful uncrewed [[lunar rover]] missions in 197O and 1973.\n\nMany missions were failures at launch. In addition, several uncrewed landing missions achieved the Lunar surface but were unsuccessful, including: [[Luna 15]], [[Luna 18]], and [[Luna 23]] all crashed on landing; and the U.S. [[Surveyor 4]] lost all radio contact only moments before its landing.\n\nMore recently, other nations have crashed spacecraft on the surface of the Moon at speeds of around {{convert|8000|km/h}}, often at precise, planned locations. These have generally been end-of-life lunar orbiters that, because of system degradations, could no longer overcome [[lunar orbit#Perturbation effects|perturbations]] from lunar [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentrations]] (\"masscons\") to maintain their orbit. Japan's lunar orbiter [[Hiten]] impacted the Moon's surface on 10 April 1993. The [[European Space Agency]] performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter [[SMART-1]] on 3 September 2006.\n\n[[Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) performed a controlled crash impact with its [[Moon Impact Probe]] (MIP) on 14 November 2008. The MIP was an ejected probe from the Indianapolis [[Chandrayaan-1]] lunar orbiter and performed [[remote sensing]] experiments during its descent to the lunar surface.\n\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter [[Chang'e 1]] executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009. The rover mission [[Chang'e 3]] soft-landed on 14 December 2013, as did its successor, [[Chang'e 4]], on 3 January 2019. All crewed and uncrewed [[Soft landing (rocketry)|soft landings]] had taken place on the [[near side of the Moon]], until 3 January 2019 when the Chinese [[Chang'e 4]] spacecraft made the first landing on the [[far side of the Moon]].<ref name =\"far side of the moon\"/>\n\nOn 22 February 2019, Israeli private space agency [[SpaceIL]] launched spacecraft [[Beresheet]] on board a Falcon 9 from Cape Canaveral, Florida with the intention of achieving a soft landing.

This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a [[Lunar Module]] on each of six [[NASA]] missions across a 41-month period starting 20 July 1969, with [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] on [[Apollo 11]], and ending on 14 December 1972 with [[Gene Cernan]] and [[Jack Schmitt]] on [[Apollo 17]]. Cernan was the last man to step off the lunar surface.\n\nAll Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the [[Apollo command module|command module]]. The last three missions included a drivable lunar rover, the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]], for increased mobility.\n\n== Scientific background ==\nTo get to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave Earth's [[gravity well]]; currently, the only practical means is a [[rocket]]. Unlike airborne vehicles such as [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloons]] and [[jet aircraft|jets]], a rocket can continue [[acceleration|accelerating]] in the [[vacuum]] outside the [[atmosphere]].\n\nUpon approach of the target moon, a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity. In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about {{convert|160|km/h}} and be ruggedized to withstand a \"hard landing\" impact, or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a \"soft landing\" (the only option for humans). The first three attempts by the U.S. to perform a successful hard Moon landing with a ruggedized [[seismometer]] package in 1962 all failed.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger3\">{{cite web| url= https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1962-012A|title=NASA \u2013 NSSDC \u2013 Spacecraft \u2013 Ranger 3 Details| accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966, followed only months later by the first uncrewed soft lunar landing by the U.S.\n\nThe speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between 70 and 100% of the [[escape velocity]] of the target moon, and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon's gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur. For Earth's Moon, the escape velocity is {{convert| 2.38|km/s}}.<ref name=\"GgLunarXPrize-MoonInfo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/lunar/education/learning-guides/escape-from-the-moon|title=Escape from the Moon!|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> The change in velocity (referred to as a [[delta-v]]) is usually provided by a landing rocket, which must be carried into space by the original [[launch vehicle]] as part of the overall spacecraft. An exception is the soft moon landing on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] carried out by the [[Huygens (spacecraft)|''Huygens'' probe]] in 2005. As the moon with the thickest atmosphere, landings on Titan may be accomplished by using [[atmospheric entry]] techniques that are generally lighter in weight than a rocket with equivalent capability.\n\nThe Soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the Moon in 1959.<ref name=\"nasa-luna2\">{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1959-014A|title=NASA \u2013 NSSDC \u2013 Spacecraft \u2013 Lun 2 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> Crash landings<ref name=\"hard-landing\">{{cite web| url= http://www.aai.ee/~vladislav/program_yft0060.html| title= Homepage of V.V Pustynski for students of YFT0060| publisher= [[Tartu Observatory]]| location= Estonia| accessdate= 17 February 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl= https://archive.today/20121218012317/http://www.aai.ee/~vladislav/program_yft0060.html| archivedate= 18 December 2012| df= dmy-all}}</ref> may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft, or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket. There have been [[list of artificial objects on the Moon|many such Moon crashes]], often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface. For example, during the Apollo program the [[S-IVB]] third stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a [[Quake (natural phenomenon)#Moonquake|moonquake]] on [[seismometer]]s that had been left on the lunar surface. Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the [[internal structure of the Moon]].\n\nTo return to Earth, the escape velocity of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the [[gravity well]] of the Moon. Rockets must be used to leave the Moon and return to space. Upon reaching Earth, atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the [[kinetic energy]] of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations. Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a moon landing rocket, increasing the latter's required size. The Moon departure rocket, larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and [[parachute]]s must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.\n\n== Political background ==\n{{Main|Space Race}}\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Tone|section|date=January 2016}}\n{{Importance section|date=January 2016}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2013}}}}\nThe intense efforts devoted in the 1960s to achieving first an uncrewed and then ultimately a human Moon landing become easier to understand in the political context of its historical era. [[World War II]] had introduced many new and deadly innovations including [[blitzkrieg]]-style surprise attacks used in the [[invasion of Poland]] and in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]; the [[V-2 rocket]], a [[ballistic missile]] which killed thousands in attacks on London and [[Antwerp]]; and the [[atom bomb]], which killed hundreds of thousands in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. In the 1950s, tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] that had emerged as victors in the conflict, particularly after the development by both countries of the [[hydrogen bomb]].\n[[File:Luna 3 moon.jpg|left|thumb|The first image of another world from space, returned by Luna 3, showed the far side of the Moon in October 1959.]]\n[[Willy Ley]] wrote in 1957 that a rocket to the Moon \"could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers\".<ref name=\"ley195707\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1957-07/Galaxy_1957_07#page/n61/mode/2up | title=For Your Information | work=Galaxy Science Fiction | date=July 1957 | accessdate=11 June 2014 | author=Ley, Willy | number=61\u201371|p=69}}</ref> On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union [[Rocket launch|launched]] ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' as the first [[artificial satellite]] to orbit the Earth and so initiated the [[Space Race]]. This unexpected event was a source of pride to the Soviets and shock to the U.S., who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear-tipped Soviet rockets in under 30 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Also, the steady beeping of the [[radio beacon]] aboard ''Sputnik 1'' as it passed overhead every 96 minutes was widely viewed on both sides{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} as effective propaganda to [[Third World]] countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the Soviet [[political system]] compared to that of the U.S. This perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid-fire Soviet space achievements. In 1959, the R-7 rocket was used to launch the first escape from Earth's gravity into a [[solar orbit]], the first crash impact onto the surface of the Moon, and the first photography of the never-before-seen [[far side of the Moon]]. These were the [[Luna 1]], [[Luna 2]], and [[Luna 3]] spacecraft.\n\n[[File:Lunar Lander Model.jpg|right|thumb|A 1963 conceptual model of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Apollo Lunar Excursion Module]]]]\nThe U.S. response to these Soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency, [[NASA]]. Military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles ([[ICBMs]]) that would bridge the so-called [[missile gap]] and enable a policy of [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] to [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] with the Soviets known as [[mutual assured destruction]] or MAD. These newly developed [[missile]]s were made available to civilians of NASA for various projects (which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload, guidance accuracy and reliabilities of U.S. ICBMs to the Soviets).\n\nWhile NASA stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets, their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic, goal-oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} just as the Soviets were doing with their R-7.\n\n== Early Soviet uncrewed lunar missions (1958\u20131965) ==\n\nAfter the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, historical records were released to allow the true accounting of Soviet lunar efforts. Unlike the U.S. tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch, the Soviets assigned a public \"[[Luna programme|Luna]]\" mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond Earth orbit. The policy had the effect of hiding Soviet Moon mission failures from public view.

The first, a mission managed by the [[United States Air Force]], exploded during launch; all subsequent Pioneer lunar flights had NASA as the lead management organization. The next two returned to Earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around {{convert|110,000|km|mi}} and {{convert|1450|km|mi|}}, far short of the roughly {{convert|400000|km|mi}} required to reach the vicinity of the Moon.\n\nNASA then collaborated with the [[United States Army]]'s [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency|Ballistic Missile Agency]] to fly two extremely small cone-shaped probes on the [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]] ICBM, carrying only [[photocells]] which would be triggered by the light of the Moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a [[Geiger-M\u00fcller tube]] detector. The first of these reached an altitude of only around {{convert| 100000|km|mi}}, serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the [[Van Allen radiation belts]] before reentering Earth's atmosphere. The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than {{convert|60000|km|mi}}, twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on-board scientific instruments, yet still becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to reach a [[solar orbit]].\n\nThe final Pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four \"[[paddlewheel]]\" [[Photovoltaic module|solar panels]] extending from a one-meter diameter spherical [[Spin-stabilized satellite|spin-stabilized]] spacecraft body equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the [[Peak of Eternal Light|poles]], record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, study radiation, measure [[Magnetic field of celestial bodies|magnetic fields]], detect [[Alfv\u00e9n wave|low frequency electromagnetic waves]] in space and use a sophisticated integrated [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well. None of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its [[Atlas (missile)|Atlas]] ICBM outfitted with an Able upper stage.\n\nFollowing the unsuccessful Atlas-Able Pioneer probes, NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] embarked upon an uncrewed spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions. The interplanetary versions were known as [[Mariner program|Mariners]]; lunar versions were [[Ranger program|Rangers]]. JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes: Block I prototypes, which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon; Block II, which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package; and Block III, which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide-area photographs of the Moon during their descent.\n\n=== Ranger missions ===\n{{See also|Ranger program}}\nThe Ranger 1 and 2 Block I missions were virtually identical.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger1\">{{cite web| url= https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1961-021A|title=NASA \u2013 NSSDC \u2013 Spacecraft \u2013 Ranger 1 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"nasa-ranger2\">{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1961-032A|title=NASA \u2013 NSSDC \u2013 Spacecraft \u2013 Ranger 2 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> Spacecraft experiments included a [[H-alpha|Lyman-alpha]] telescope, a [[rubidium|rubidium-vapor]] [[magnetometer]], electrostatic analyzers, medium-energy-range [[particle detector]]s, two triple coincidence telescopes, a cosmic-ray integrating [[ionization chamber]], [[cosmic dust]] detectors, and [[scintillation counter]]s. The goal was to place these Block I spacecraft in a very high Earth orbit with an apogee of {{convert|110000|km|mi}} and a [[perigee]] of {{convert|60000|km|mi}}.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger1\"/>\n\nFrom that vantage point, scientists could make direct measurements of the [[magnetosphere]] over a period of many months while engineers perfected new methods to routinely track and communicate with spacecraft over such large distances. Such practice was deemed vital to be assured of capturing high-bandwidth television transmissions from the Moon during a one-shot fifteen-minute time window in subsequent Block II and Block III lunar descents. Both Block I missions suffered failures of the new Agena upper stage and never left low Earth [[parking orbit]] after launch; both burned up upon reentry after only a few days.\n\nThe first attempts to perform a Moon landing took place in 1962 during the Rangers 3, 4 and 5 missions flown by the United States.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger3\"/><ref name=\"nasa-ranger4\"/><ref name=\"nasa-ranger5\"/> All three Block II missions basic vehicles were 3.1&nbsp;m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact-limiter, 650&nbsp;mm in diameter, a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of {{convert|5050|lbf|kN}},<ref name=\"nasa-ranger4\"/> and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base 1.5&nbsp;m in diameter. This lander (code-named ''Tonto'') was designed to provide impact cushioning using an exterior blanket of crushable balsa wood and an interior filled with incompressible liquid [[freon]]. A 42&nbsp;kg (56 pounds) {{convert|30|cm|ft|adj=mid|-diameter}} metal payload sphere floated and was free to rotate in a liquid freon reservoir contained in the landing sphere.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote=\"Everything that we do ought to really be tied-in to getting onto the Moon ahead of the Russians. ...We're ready to spend reasonable amounts of money, but we're talking about fantastic expenditures which wreck our budget and all these other domestic programs, and the only justification for it, in my opinion, to do it is because we hope to beat them and demonstrate that starting behind, as we did by a couple of years, by God, we passed them.\"|source=\u2014 [[John F.

Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere. After landing, plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere. The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere. Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator, which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch.\n\nNo cameras were carried by the Ranger landers, and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission. Instead, the {{convert|3.1|m|ft}} Ranger Block II mother ship carried a 200-scan-line television camera which was to capture images during the free-fall descent to the lunar surface. The camera was designed to transmit a picture every 10 seconds.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger4\"/> Seconds before impact, at {{convert|5|and|0.6|km|mi}} above the lunar surface, the Ranger mother ships took picture (which may be viewed [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/ranger.html here]).\n\nOther instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter. The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid-fueled braking rocket overboard from the Block II mother ship. The braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at {{convert|330|m|ft}} above the surface and separate, allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nOn Ranger 3, failure of the Atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the Agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the Moon. Attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the Moon were thwarted by in-flight failure of the onboard flight computer. This was probably because of prior [[sterilization (microbiology)|heat sterilization]] of the spacecraft by keeping it above the [[boiling]] point of water for 24 hours on the ground, to protect the Moon from being contaminated by Earth organisms. Heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in-flight failures of the spacecraft computer on Ranger 4 and the power subsystem on Ranger 5. Only Ranger 4 reached the Moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the Moon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nHeat sterilization was discontinued for the final four Block III Ranger probes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These replaced the Block II landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier, more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming Apollo crewed Moon landing missions. Six cameras were designed to take thousands of high-altitude photographs in the final twenty-minute period before crashing on the lunar surface. Camera resolution was 1,132 scan lines, far higher than the 525 lines found in a typical U.S. 1964 home television. While [[Ranger 6]] suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight, the subsequent [[Ranger 7]] mission to Mare Cognitum was a complete success.\n\nBreaking the six-year string of failures in U.S. attempts to photograph the Moon at close range, the [[Ranger 7]] mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key 1965 NASA budget appropriation to pass through the [[United States Congress]] intact without a reduction in funds for the Apollo crewed Moon landing program. Subsequent successes with [[Ranger 8]] and [[Ranger 9]] further buoyed U.S. hopes.\n\n== Soviet uncrewed soft landings (1966\u20131976) ==\n[[File:\u041b\u0443\u043d\u0430-16.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Model of Luna 16 Moon soil sample return lander]]\n[[File:Soviet moonrover.JPG|thumb|right|Model of Soviet Lunokhod automatic Moon rover]]\nThe [[Luna 9]] spacecraft, launched by the [[Soviet Union]], performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February 1966.

To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming crewed landers with their much greater weight.\n\nHowever, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a {{convert|50|kph|adj=on}} ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned {{convert|160|kph|adj=on}} impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a crewed flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.\n\n[[File:Space Race 1957-1975 black text.png|thumb|450px|A timeline of the space race between 1957 and 1975, with missions from the US and USSR.]]\n\nAdvances in other areas were necessary before crewed spacecraft could follow uncrewed ones to the surface of the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all flew directly to the surface without a lunar orbit. Such [[direct ascent]]s use a minimum amount of fuel for uncrewed spacecraft on a one-way trip.\n\nIn contrast, crewed vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to Earth for the crew. Leaving this massive amount of required Earth-return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a Moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again, working against lunar gravity both ways. Such considerations lead logically to a [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] mission profile for a crewed Moon landing.\n\nAccordingly, beginning in mid-1966 both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. naturally progressed into missions featuring lunar orbit as a prerequisite to a crewed Moon landing. The primary goals of these initial uncrewed orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of crewed landing sites and, for the Soviets, the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings.\n\nAn unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the Moon's [[lunar maria|maria]]. Such mass concentrations (\"[[mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]]\") can send a crewed mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe. Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low-altitude satellites around the Moon, making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years.\n\nControlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value. For example, in 1999 the NASA [[Lunar Prospector]] orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of Shoemaker Crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume detectable from Earth. No such plume was observed. However, a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist [[Eugene Shoemaker]] was delivered by the Lunar Prospector to the crater named in his honor \u2013 currently{{when|date=September 2019}} the only human remains on the Moon.\n\n== Soviet lunar orbit satellites (1966\u20131974) ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n\n! align=center | U.S.S.R. mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Booster\n! align=center | Launched\n! align=center | Mission goal\n! align=center | Mission result\n|-\n| Cosmos \u2013 111\n|\n| [[Molniya-M]]\n| align=\"right\" | 1 March 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 stranded in low Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Luna 10|Luna-10]]\n| 1,582\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 31 March 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 2,738&nbsp;km x 2,088&nbsp;km x 72 deg orbit, 178&nbsp;m period, 60-day science mission\n|-\n| [[Luna 11|Luna-11]]\n| 1,640\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 24 August 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 2,931&nbsp;km x 1,898&nbsp;km x 27 deg orbit, 178&nbsp;m period, 38-day science mission\n|-\n| [[Luna 12|Luna-12]]\n| 1,620\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 22 October 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 2,938&nbsp;km x 1,871&nbsp;km x 10 deg orbit, 205&nbsp;m period, 89-day science mission\n|-\n| Cosmos-159\n| 1,700\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 17 May 1967\n| Prototype test\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 high Earth orbit crewed landing communications gear radio calibration test\n|-\n|\n|\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 7 February 1968\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit \u2013 attempted radio calibration test?\n|-\n| [[Luna 14|Luna-14]]\n| 1,700\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 7 April 1968\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 870&nbsp;km x 160&nbsp;km x 42 deg orbit, 160&nbsp;m period, unstable orbit, radio calibration test?\n|-\n| [[Luna 19|Luna-19]]\n| 5,700\n| [[Proton rocket|Proton]]\n| align=\"right\" | 28 September 1971\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 140&nbsp;km x 140&nbsp;km x 41 deg orbit, 121&nbsp;m period, 388-day science mission\n|-\n| [[Luna 22|Luna-22]]\n| 5,700\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 29 May 1974\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 222&nbsp;km x 219&nbsp;km x 19 deg orbit, 130&nbsp;m period, 521-day science mission\n|-\n|}\n\n[[Luna 10]] became the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon on 3 April 1966.\n\n== U.S. lunar orbit satellites (1966\u20131967) ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n! align=left | U.S. mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Booster\n! align=center | Launched\n! align=center | Mission goal\n! align=center | Mission result\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 1]]\n| 386\n| [[Atlas (missile)|Atlas]] \u2013 [[RM-81 Agena|Agena]]\n| align=\"right\" | 10 August 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 1,160&nbsp;km X 189&nbsp;km x 12 deg orbit, 208&nbsp;m period, 80-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 2]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 6 November 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 1,860&nbsp;km X 52&nbsp;km x 12 deg orbit, 208&nbsp;m period, 339-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 3]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 5 February 1967\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 1,860&nbsp;km X 52&nbsp;km x 21 deg orbit, 208&nbsp;m period, 246-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 4]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 4 May 1967\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 6,111&nbsp;km X 2,706&nbsp;km x 86 deg orbit, 721&nbsp;m period, 180-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 5]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 1 August 1967\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 6,023&nbsp;km X 195&nbsp;km x 85 deg orbit, 510&nbsp;m period, 183-day photography mission\n|-\n|}\n\n== Soviet circumlunar loop flights (1967\u20131970) ==\n{{Main|Soviet crewed lunar programs}}\n[[File:Zond Assembly.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Zond program|Zond]] mounted on top stage of Proton booster in assembly hangar]]\nIt is possible to aim a spacecraft from Earth so it will loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, following the so-called [[free return trajectory]]. Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required. However, a crewed circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges beyond those found in a crewed low-Earth-orbit mission, offering valuable lessons in preparation for a crewed Moon landing. Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere upon returning from the Moon.\n\nInhabited Earth-orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle return to Earth from speeds of around {{convert|27000|km/h|m/s|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Due to the effects of gravity, a vehicle returning from the Moon hits Earth's atmosphere at a much higher speed of around {{convert|40000|km/h|m/s|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The [[g-force|g-loading]] on astronauts during the resulting [[acceleration|deceleration]] can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry. Slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the Moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force.\n\nAchieving a crewed circumlunar loop flight prior to a crewed lunar landing became a primary goal of the Soviets with their [[Zond program|Zond]] spacecraft program. The first three Zonds were robotic planetary probes; after that, the Zond name was transferred to a completely separate human spaceflight program. The initial focus of these later Zonds was extensive testing of required high-speed reentry techniques. This focus was not shared by the U.S., who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a crewed circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose.\n\nInitial crewed spaceflights in the early 1960s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet [[Vostok programme|Vostok]] and U.S. [[Mercury program|Mercury]] programs. A two-flight extension of the Vostok program known as [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965. These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U.S. in ten [[Gemini program|Gemini]] low Earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966, using a totally new second-generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier Mercury. These Gemini missions went on to prove techniques for orbital [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous and docking]] crucial to a crewed lunar landing mission profile.\n\nAfter the end of the Gemini program, the Soviet Union began flying their second-generation Zond crewed spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him or her immediately to Earth. The [[Zond program|Zond]] spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational [[Proton rocket|Proton]] launch rocket, unlike the parallel Soviet human Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third-generation [[Soyuz spacecraft]] requiring development of the advanced [[N-1 rocket|N-1]] booster. The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a crewed Zond circumlunar flight years before a U.S. human lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory. However, significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U.S. Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort.\n\nLike Zond, Apollo flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to Earth via a circumlunar loop if a [[Apollo service module|service module]] malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit. This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the [[Apollo 13]] mission in 1970, which is the only crewed circumlunar loop mission flown to date.{{when|date=September 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse; \"\n|-\n! align=left | U.S.S.R mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Booster\n! align=center | Launched\n! align=center | Mission goal\n! align=center | Payload\n! align=center | Mission result\n|-\n| [[Cosmos-146]]\n| 5,400\n| [[Proton rocket|Proton]]\n| align=\"right\" | 10 March 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 Successfully reached high Earth orbit, but became stranded and was unable to initiate controlled high speed atmospheric reentry test\n|-\n| [[Cosmos-154]]\n| 5,400\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 8 April 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 Successfully reached high Earth orbit, but became stranded and was unable to initiate controlled high speed atmospheric reentry test\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 28 September 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 22 November 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Zond 4|Zond-4]]\n| 5,140\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 2 March 1968\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 launched successfully to 300,000&nbsp;km high Earth orbit, high speed reentry test guidance malfunction, intentional self-destruct to prevent landfall outside Soviet Union\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 23 April 1968\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit; launch preparation tank explosion kills three in pad crew\n|-\n| [[Zond 5|Zond-5]]\n| 5,375\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 15 September 1968\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 looped around Moon with Earth's first near-lunar life forms, two tortoises and other live biological specimens, and the capsule and payload safely to Earth despite landing off-target outside the Soviet Union in the Indian Ocean\n|-\n| [[Zond 6|Zond-6]]\n| 5,375\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 10 November 1968\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 looped around Moon, successful reentry, but loss of cabin air pressure caused biological payload death, parachute system malfunction and severe vehicle damage upon landing\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 20 January 1969\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Zond 7|Zond-7]]\n| 5,979\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 8 August 1969\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 looped around Moon, returned biological payload safely to Earth and landed on-target inside Soviet Union.

Despite the failure suffered in its final moments, the Zond 6 mission was reported by Soviet media as being a success as well. Although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements, both these Zond missions flew off-nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to humans.\n\nAs a result, the Soviets secretly planned to continue uncrewed Zond tests until their reliability to support human flight had been demonstrated. However, due to NASA's continuing problems with the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]], and because of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] reports of a potential Soviet crewed circumlunar flight in late 1968, NASA fatefully changed the flight plan of [[Apollo 8]] from an Earth-orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late December 1968.\n\nIn early December 1968 the launch window to the Moon opened for the Soviet launch site in [[Baikonur]], giving the USSR their final chance to beat the US to the Moon. [[Cosmonauts]] went on alert and asked to fly the Zond spacecraft then in final countdown at Baikonur on the first human trip to the Moon. Ultimately, however, the Soviet [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of Zond/Proton and so scrubbed the launch of a crewed Soviet lunar mission. Their decision proved to be a wise one, since this unnumbered Zond mission was destroyed in another uncrewed test when it was finally launched several weeks later.\n\nBy this time flights of the third generation U.S. [[Apollo spacecraft]] had begun. Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The [[Apollo 8]] mission carried out the first human trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the [[Saturn V]] booster for crewed use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. [[Apollo 10]] then performed a full dress rehearsal of a crewed Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within {{convert|47,400|ft|km}} of the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module too heavy to land. With the failure of the robotic Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt [[Luna 15]] in July 1969, the stage was set for [[Apollo 11]].\n\n== Human Moon landings (1969\u20131972) ==\n[[File:N1%2BSaturn5.jpg|thumb|250px|The U.S. [[Saturn V]] and the Soviet [[N1 (rocket)|N1]].]]\n\n=== US strategy ===\n{{Main|Apollo program#Political pressure builds}}\nPlans for human Moon exploration began during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration. In a series of mid-1950s articles in ''[[Collier's]]'' magazine, [[Wernher von Braun]] had popularized the idea of a crewed expedition to establish a lunar base. A human Moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the US and USSR. Besides guidance and weight management, [[atmospheric re-entry]] without [[Ablation|ablative]] overheating was a major hurdle. After the Soviets launched [[Sputnik]], von Braun promoted a plan for the US Army to establish a military lunar outpost by 1965.\n\nAfter the [[Space race#Humans in space|early Soviet successes]], especially [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s flight, US President [[John F. Kennedy]] looked for a project that would capture the public imagination. He asked Vice President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove US world leadership. The proposals included non-space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the [[Third World]]. The Soviets, at the time, had more powerful rockets than the US, which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission.\n\nAdvances in US nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller, lighter warheads; the Soviets' were much heavier, and the powerful [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] rocket was developed to carry them. More modest missions such as flying around the Moon, or a space lab in lunar orbit (both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun), offered too much advantage to the Soviets; ''landing'', however, would capture the world's imagination.\n\n[[File:Apollo Landings by Nasa.jpg|thumb|350px|Apollo landing sites]]\nJohnson had championed the US human spaceflight program ever since Sputnik, sponsoring legislation to create NASA while he was still a senator. When Kennedy asked him in 1961 to research the best achievement to counter the Soviets' lead, Johnson responded that the US had an even chance of beating them to a crewed lunar landing, but not for anything less. Kennedy seized on Apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space. He ensured continuing funding, shielding space spending from the 1963 tax cut, but diverting money from other NASA scientific projects. These diversions dismayed NASA's leader, [[James E. Webb]], who perceived the need for NASA's support from the scientific community.\n\nThe Moon landing required development of the large Saturn V [[launch vehicle]], which achieved a perfect record: zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle-caused mission failures in thirteen launches.\n\nFor the program to succeed, its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians both on the left (more money for social programs) and on the right (more money for the military). By emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of Soviet space dominance, Kennedy and Johnson managed to swing public opinion: by 1965, 58 percent of Americans favored Apollo, up from 33 percent two years earlier. After Johnson [[Assassination of President John F. Kennedy|became President in 1963]], his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in 1969, as Kennedy had planned.\n\n=== Soviet strategy ===\n{{Main|Soviet crewed lunar programs{{!}}Soviet Moonshot}}\n\nSoviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] said in October 1963 the USSR was \"not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the Moon,\" while insisting that the Soviets had not dropped out of the race. Only after another year would the USSR fully commit itself to a Moon-landing attempt, which ultimately failed.\n\nAt the same time, Kennedy had suggested various joint programs, including a possible Moon landing by Soviet and U.S. astronauts and the development of better weather-monitoring satellites. Khrushchev, sensing an attempt by Kennedy to steal Russian space technology, rejected the idea: if the USSR went to the Moon, it would go alone. [[Sergey Korolev]], the [[Soviet space program]]'s chief designer, had started promoting his [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] craft and the [[N1 (rocket)|N1]] launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a human Moon landing.\n\nKhrushchev directed Korolev's design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing Vostok technology, while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft, the Proton booster and the Zond, for a human cislunar flight in 1966. In 1964 the new Soviet leadership gave Korolev the backing for a Moon landing effort and brought all crewed projects under his direction.\n\nWith Korolev's death and the failure of the first Soyuz flight in 1967, coordination of the Soviet Moon landing program quickly unraveled. The Soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for a mission that would have placed [[Alexei Leonov]] on the Moon's surface, but with the successive launch failures of the N1 booster in 1969, plans for a crewed landing suffered first delay and then cancellation.\n\nA program of automated return vehicles was begun, in the hope of being the first to return lunar rocks. This had several failures. It eventually succeeded with [[Luna 16]].<ref>[http://www.zarya.info/Diaries/Luna/Luna16.php The Mission of Luna 16]</ref> But this had little impact, because the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 lunar landings and rock returns had already taken place by then.\n\n=== Apollo missions ===\n[[File:Buzz salutes the U.S. Flag.jpg|thumb|right|Astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]], Lunar Module pilot of the first lunar landing mission, poses for a photograph beside the deployed [[Flag of the United States|United States flag]] during an Apollo 11 Extravehicular Activity (EVA) on the lunar surface.]]\n\nIn total, twenty-four U.S. astronauts have traveled to the Moon. Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of [[free return trajectory]]; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of crewed Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut [[Alan Bean]] is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=In the Shadow of the Moon|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=37065|publisher=comingsoon.net|accessdate=7 February 2008}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Human Moon landings ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!Mission name\n!Lunar lander\n! width=\"11%\" |Lunar landing date\n! width=\"11%\" |Lunar liftoff date\n! width=\"12%\" |Lunar landing site\n!Duration on lunar surface (DD:HH:MM)\n! width=\"25%\" |Crew\n!Number of [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]]\n!Total EVA Time (HH:MM)\n|-\n||[[Apollo 11]]\n||''Eagle''\n| align=\"right\" |20 July 1969\n| align=\"right\" |21 July 1969\n||[[Mare Tranquillitatis|Sea of Tranquility]]\n||0:21:31\n||[[Neil Armstrong]], [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin]]\n||1\n||2:31\n|-\n||[[Apollo 12]]\n||''Intrepid''\n| align=\"right\" |19 November 1969\n| align=\"right\" |21 November 1969\n||[[Oceanus Procellarum|Ocean of Storms]]\n||1:07:31\n||[[Pete Conrad|Charles \"Pete\" Conrad]], [[Alan Bean]]\n||2\n||7:45\n|-\n||[[Apollo 14]]\n||''Antares''\n| align=\"right\" |5 February 1971\n| align=\"right\" |6 February 1971\n||[[Fra Mauro formation|Fra Mauro]]\n||1:09:30\n||[[Alan Shepard|Alan B.

Launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on a Falcon 9 booster, with the lander being one of three payloads on the rocket. Beresheet arrived near the Moon using a slow but fuel-efficient trajectory. Taking six weeks and several increasingly large orbits around the Earth, it first achieved a large elliptical orbit around Earth with an apogee near {{convert|400000|km|sp=us}}. At that point, with a short deceleration burn, it was caught by the Moon's gravity in a highly elliptical lunar orbit, an orbit which was circularized and reduced in diameter over a week's time, before attempting a landing on the Moon's surface on 11 April 2019. The mission was the first Israeli, and the first privately funded, lunar landing attempt.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/israeli-start-aims-put-first-private-space-probe-moon-ncna971556 |title=First privately funded lunar landing |publisher=NBC News}}</ref> SpaceIL was originally conceived in 2011 as a venture to pursue the [[Google Lunar X Prize]]. On 11 April 2019 ''Beresheet'' crashed on the surface of the Moon, as a result of a main engine failure in the final descent. The ''Beresheet'' lunar lander's target landing destination was within Mare Serenitatis, a vast volcanic basin on the Moon's northern near side. Despite the failure, the mission represents the closest a private entity has come to a soft lunar landing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/04/spaceil-beresheet-first-privately-funded-israeli-spacecraft-crash-lands-on-moon/|title=First privately funded moon lander crash-lands|date=2019-04-11|website=Science & Innovation|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Chandrayaan 2 (India) ===\n[[ISRO]], the Indian National Space agency, launched [[Chandrayaan 2]] on 22 July 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48919572|title=India announces new date for space launch|publisher=BBC News|date=2019-07-18|access-date=2019-07-21|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-moon-mission-set-to-launch-a-week-after-it-was-aborted/2019/07/22/d599087e-ac45-11e9-9411-a608f9d0c2d3_story.html |title=India moon mission set to launch a week after it was aborted |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2019-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722073652/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-moon-mission-set-to-launch-a-week-after-it-was-aborted/2019/07/22/d599087e-ac45-11e9-9411-a608f9d0c2d3_story.html |archive-date=2019-07-22}}</ref> It has 3 major modules: Orbiter, Lander and Rover.

All [[Soft landing (aeronautics)|soft landings]] took place on the [[near side of the Moon]] until 3 January 2019, when the Chinese [[Chang'e 4]] spacecraft made the first landing on the [[far side of the Moon]].<ref name =\"far side of the moon\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/c4dc6858a32b4b61bdbc6aebf5459a91|title=Chinese spacecraft makes first landing on moon's far side|date=2019-01-03|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>\n\n== Uncrewed landings ==\nAfter the unsuccessful attempt by [[Luna 1]] to land on the Moon in 1959, the [[Soviet Union]] performed the first hard Moon landing \u2013 \"hard\" meaning the spacecraft intentionally crashes into the Moon \u2013 later that same year with the [[Luna 2]] spacecraft, a feat the U.S. duplicated in 1962 with [[Ranger 4]]. Since then, twelve Soviet and U.S. spacecraft have used braking rockets ([[retrorocket]]s) to make [[Soft landing (aeronautics)|soft landings]] and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface, between 1966 and 1976. In 1966 the USSR accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the [[Luna 9]] and [[Luna 13]] missions. The U.S. followed with five uncrewed [[Surveyor Program|Surveyor]] soft landings.\n\nThe Soviet Union achieved the first uncrewed lunar soil [[sample return mission|sample return]] with the [[Luna 16]] probe on 24 September 1970. This was followed by [[Luna 20]] and [[Luna 24]] in 1972 and 1976, respectively. Following the failure at launch in 1969 of the first [[Lunokhod]], [[Luna E-8 No.201]], the [[Luna 17]] and [[Luna 21]] were successful uncrewed [[lunar rover]] missions in 1970 and 1973.\n\nMany missions were failures at launch. In addition, several uncrewed landing missions achieved the Lunar surface but were unsuccessful, including: [[Luna 15]], [[Luna 18]], and [[Luna 23]] all crashed on landing; and the U.S. [[Surveyor 4]] lost all radio contact only moments before its landing.\n\nMore recently, other nations have crashed spacecraft on the surface of the Moon at speeds of around {{convert|8000|km/h}}, often at precise, planned locations. These have generally been end-of-life lunar orbiters that, because of system degradations, could no longer overcome [[lunar orbit#Perturbation effects|perturbations]] from lunar [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentrations]] (\"masscons\") to maintain their orbit. Japan's lunar orbiter [[Hiten]] impacted the Moon's surface on 10 April 1993. The [[European Space Agency]] performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter [[SMART-1]] on 3 September 2006.\n\n[[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) performed a controlled crash impact with its [[Moon Impact Probe]] (MIP) on 14 November 2008. The MIP was an ejected probe from the Indian [[Chandrayaan-1]] lunar orbiter and performed [[remote sensing]] experiments during its descent to the lunar surface.\n\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter [[Chang'e 1]] executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009. The rover mission [[Chang'e 3]] soft-landed on 14 December 2013, as did its successor, [[Chang'e 4]], on 3 January 2019. All crewed and uncrewed [[Soft landing (rocketry)|soft landings]] had taken place on the [[near side of the Moon]], until 3 January 2019 when the Chinese [[Chang'e 4]] spacecraft made the first landing on the [[far side of the Moon]].<ref name =\"far side of the moon\"/>\n\nOn 22 February 2019, Israeli private space agency [[SpaceIL]] launched spacecraft [[Beresheet]] on board a Falcon 9 from Cape Canaveral, Florida with the intention of achieving a soft landing.

This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a [[Lunar Module]] on each of six [[NASA]] missions across a 41-month period starting 20 July 1969, with [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] on [[Apollo 11]], and ending on 14 December 1972 with [[Gene Cernan]] and [[Jack Schmitt]] on [[Apollo 17]]. Cernan was the last man to step off the lunar surface.\n\nAll Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the [[Apollo command module|command module]]. The last three missions included a drivable lunar rover, the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]], for increased mobility.\n\n== Scientific background ==\nTo get to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave Earth's [[gravity well]]; currently, the only practical means is a [[rocket]]. Unlike airborne vehicles such as [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloons]] and [[jet aircraft|jets]], a rocket can continue [[acceleration|accelerating]] in the [[vacuum]] outside the [[atmosphere]].\n\nUpon approach of the target moon, a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity. In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about {{convert|160|km/h}} and be ruggedized to withstand a \"hard landing\" impact, or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a \"soft landing\" (the only option for humans). The first three attempts by the U.S. to perform a successful hard Moon landing with a ruggedized [[seismometer]] package in 1962 all failed.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger3\">{{cite web| url= https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1962-012A|title=NASA \u2013 NSSDC \u2013 Spacecraft \u2013 Ranger 3 Details| accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966, followed only months later by the first uncrewed soft lunar landing by the U.S.\n\nThe speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between 70 and 100% of the [[escape velocity]] of the target moon, and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon's gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur. For Earth's Moon, the escape velocity is {{convert| 2.38|km/s}}.<ref name=\"GgLunarXPrize-MoonInfo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/lunar/education/learning-guides/escape-from-the-moon|title=Escape from the Moon!|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> The change in velocity (referred to as a [[delta-v]]) is usually provided by a landing rocket, which must be carried into space by the original [[launch vehicle]] as part of the overall spacecraft. An exception is the soft moon landing on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] carried out by the [[Huygens (spacecraft)|''Huygens'' probe]] in 2005. As the moon with the thickest atmosphere, landings on Titan may be accomplished by using [[atmospheric entry]] techniques that are generally lighter in weight than a rocket with equivalent capability.\n\nThe Soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the Moon in 1959.<ref name=\"nasa-luna2\">{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1959-014A|title=NASA \u2013 NSSDC \u2013 Spacecraft \u2013 Lun 2 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> Crash landings<ref name=\"hard-landing\">{{cite web| url= http://www.aai.ee/~vladislav/program_yft0060.html| title= Homepage of V.V Pustynski for students of YFT0060| publisher= [[Tartu Observatory]]| location= Estonia| accessdate= 17 February 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl= https://archive.today/20121218012317/http://www.aai.ee/~vladislav/program_yft0060.html| archivedate= 18 December 2012| df= dmy-all}}</ref> may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft, or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket. There have been [[list of artificial objects on the Moon|many such Moon crashes]], often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface. For example, during the Apollo program the [[S-IVB]] third stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a [[Quake (natural phenomenon)#Moonquake|moonquake]] on [[seismometer]]s that had been left on the lunar surface. Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the [[internal structure of the Moon]].\n\nTo return to Earth, the escape velocity of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the [[gravity well]] of the Moon. Rockets must be used to leave the Moon and return to space. Upon reaching Earth, atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the [[kinetic energy]] of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations. Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a moon landing rocket, increasing the latter's required size. The Moon departure rocket, larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and [[parachute]]s must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.\n\n== Political background ==\n{{Main|Space Race}}\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Tone|section|date=January 2016}}\n{{Importance section|date=January 2016}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2013}}}}\nThe intense efforts devoted in the 1960s to achieving first an uncrewed and then ultimately a human Moon landing become easier to understand in the political context of its historical era. [[World War II]] had introduced many new and deadly innovations including [[blitzkrieg]]-style surprise attacks used in the [[invasion of Poland]] and in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]; the [[V-2 rocket]], a [[ballistic missile]] which killed thousands in attacks on London and [[Antwerp]]; and the [[atom bomb]], which killed hundreds of thousands in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. In the 1950s, tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] that had emerged as victors in the conflict, particularly after the development by both countries of the [[hydrogen bomb]].\n[[File:Luna 3 moon.jpg|left|thumb|The first image of another world from space, returned by Luna 3, showed the far side of the Moon in October 1959.]]\n[[Willy Ley]] wrote in 1957 that a rocket to the Moon \"could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers\".<ref name=\"ley195707\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1957-07/Galaxy_1957_07#page/n61/mode/2up | title=For Your Information | work=Galaxy Science Fiction | date=July 1957 | accessdate=11 June 2014 | author=Ley, Willy | number=61\u201371|p=69}}</ref> On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union [[Rocket launch|launched]] ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' as the first [[artificial satellite]] to orbit the Earth and so initiated the [[Space Race]]. This unexpected event was a source of pride to the Soviets and shock to the U.S., who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear-tipped Soviet rockets in under 30 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Also, the steady beeping of the [[radio beacon]] aboard ''Sputnik 1'' as it passed overhead every 96 minutes was widely viewed on both sides{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} as effective propaganda to [[Third World]] countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the Soviet [[political system]] compared to that of the U.S. This perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid-fire Soviet space achievements. In 1959, the R-7 rocket was used to launch the first escape from Earth's gravity into a [[solar orbit]], the first crash impact onto the surface of the Moon, and the first photography of the never-before-seen [[far side of the Moon]]. These were the [[Luna 1]], [[Luna 2]], and [[Luna 3]] spacecraft.\n\n[[File:Lunar Lander Model.jpg|right|thumb|A 1963 conceptual model of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Apollo Lunar Excursion Module]]]]\nThe U.S. response to these Soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency, [[NASA]]. Military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles ([[ICBMs]]) that would bridge the so-called [[missile gap]] and enable a policy of [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] to [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] with the Soviets known as [[mutual assured destruction]] or MAD. These newly developed [[missile]]s were made available to civilians of NASA for various projects (which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload, guidance accuracy and reliabilities of U.S. ICBMs to the Soviets).\n\nWhile NASA stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets, their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic, goal-oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} just as the Soviets were doing with their R-7.\n\n== Early Soviet uncrewed lunar missions (1958\u20131965) ==\n\nAfter the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, historical records were released to allow the true accounting of Soviet lunar efforts. Unlike the U.S. tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch, the Soviets assigned a public \"[[Luna programme|Luna]]\" mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond Earth orbit. The policy had the effect of hiding Soviet Moon mission failures from public view. If the attempt failed in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon, it was frequently (but not always) given a \"[[Sputnik programme|Sputnik]]\" or \"[[Cosmos (satellite)|Cosmos]]\" Earth-orbit mission number to hide its purpose. Launch explosions were not acknowledged at all.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n! align=left | Mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Launch vehicle\n! align=center | Launch date\n! align=center | Goal\n! align=center | Result\n|-\n|\n|\n| [[Semyorka]] \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 23 September 1958\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 93 s\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 12 October 1958\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 104 s\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 4 December 1958\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 254 s\n|-\n| [[Luna 1|Luna-1]]\n| 361\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 2 January 1959\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 first spacecraft to reach escape velocity, lunar flyby, solar orbit; missed the Moon\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 18 June 1959\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 153 s\n|-\n| [[Luna 2|Luna-2]]\n| 390\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 12 September 1959\n| Impact\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 first lunar impact\n|-\n| [[Luna 3|Luna-3]]\n| 270\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 4 October 1959\n| Flyby\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 first photos of lunar far side\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 15 April 1960\n| Flyby\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K72\n| align=\"right\" | 16 April 1960\n| Flyby\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 1 s\n|-\n| [[Sputnik]]-25\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 4 January 1963\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 stranded in low Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 3 February 1963\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction at T+ 105 s\n|-\n| [[Luna 4|Luna-4]]\n| 1422\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 2 April 1963\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 lunar flyby at {{convert|8000|km|mi}}\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 21 March 1964\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 20 April 1964\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Cosmos (satellite)|Cosmos]]-60\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 12 March 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 stranded in low Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 10 April 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Luna 5|Luna-5]]\n| 1475\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 9 May 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 lunar impact\n|-\n| [[Luna 6|Luna-6]]\n| 1440\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 8 June 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 lunar flyby at {{convert|160000|km|mi}}\n|-\n| [[Luna 7|Luna-7]]\n| 1504\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 4 October 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 lunar impact\n|-\n| [[Luna 8|Luna-8]]\n| 1550\n| Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n| align=\"right\" | 3 December 1965\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 lunar impact during landing attempt\n|-\n|}\n\n== Early U.S. uncrewed lunar missions (1958\u20131965) ==\n{{essay-like|section|date=September 2019}}\n[[File:Ranger 9 sudden impact.gif|thumb|right|Artist's portrayal of a Ranger spacecraft right before impact]]\n[[File:Ranger8-moon.jpg|thumb|right|One of the last photos of the Moon transmitted by Ranger 8 right before impact]]\n\nIn contrast to Soviet lunar exploration triumphs in 1959, success eluded initial U.S. efforts to reach the Moon with the [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] and [[Ranger program]]s.

The first, a mission managed by the [[United States Air Force]], exploded during launch; all subsequent Pioneer lunar flights had NASA as the lead management organization. The next two returned to Earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around {{convert|110,000|km|mi}} and {{convert|1450|km|mi|}}, far short of the roughly {{convert|400000|km|mi}} required to reach the vicinity of the Moon.\n\nNASA then collaborated with the [[United States Army]]'s [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency|Ballistic Missile Agency]] to fly two extremely small cone-shaped probes on the [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]] ICBM, carrying only [[photocells]] which would be triggered by the light of the Moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a [[Geiger-M\u00fcller tube]] detector. The first of these reached an altitude of only around {{convert| 100000|km|mi}}, serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the [[Van Allen radiation belts]] before reentering Earth's atmosphere. The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than {{convert|60000|km|mi}}, twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on-board scientific instruments, yet still becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to reach a [[solar orbit]].\n\nThe final Pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four \"[[paddlewheel]]\" [[Photovoltaic module|solar panels]] extending from a one-meter diameter spherical [[Spin-stabilized satellite|spin-stabilized]] spacecraft body equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the [[Peak of Eternal Light|poles]], record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, study radiation, measure [[Magnetic field of celestial bodies|magnetic fields]], detect [[Alfv\u00e9n wave|low frequency electromagnetic waves]] in space and use a sophisticated integrated [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well. None of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its [[Atlas (missile)|Atlas]] ICBM outfitted with an Able upper stage.\n\nFollowing the unsuccessful Atlas-Able Pioneer probes, NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] embarked upon an uncrewed spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions. The interplanetary versions were known as [[Mariner program|Mariners]]; lunar versions were [[Ranger program|Rangers]]. JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes: Block I prototypes, which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon; Block II, which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package; and Block III, which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide-area photographs of the Moon during their descent.\n\n=== Ranger missions ===\n{{See also|Ranger program}}\nThe Ranger 1 and 2 Block I missions were virtually identical.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger1\">{{cite web| url= https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1961-021A|title=NASA \u2013 NSSDC \u2013 Spacecraft \u2013 Ranger 1 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"nasa-ranger2\">{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1961-032A|title=NASA \u2013 NSSDC \u2013 Spacecraft \u2013 Ranger 2 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> Spacecraft experiments included a [[H-alpha|Lyman-alpha]] telescope, a [[rubidium|rubidium-vapor]] [[magnetometer]], electrostatic analyzers, medium-energy-range [[particle detector]]s, two triple coincidence telescopes, a cosmic-ray integrating [[ionization chamber]], [[cosmic dust]] detectors, and [[scintillation counter]]s. The goal was to place these Block I spacecraft in a very high Earth orbit with an apogee of {{convert|110000|km|mi}} and a [[perigee]] of {{convert|60000|km|mi}}.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger1\"/>\n\nFrom that vantage point, scientists could make direct measurements of the [[magnetosphere]] over a period of many months while engineers perfected new methods to routinely track and communicate with spacecraft over such large distances. Such practice was deemed vital to be assured of capturing high-bandwidth television transmissions from the Moon during a one-shot fifteen-minute time window in subsequent Block II and Block III lunar descents. Both Block I missions suffered failures of the new Agena upper stage and never left low Earth [[parking orbit]] after launch; both burned up upon reentry after only a few days.\n\nThe first attempts to perform a Moon landing took place in 1962 during the Rangers 3, 4 and 5 missions flown by the United States.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger3\"/><ref name=\"nasa-ranger4\"/><ref name=\"nasa-ranger5\"/> All three Block II missions basic vehicles were 3.1&nbsp;m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact-limiter, 650&nbsp;mm in diameter, a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of {{convert|5050|lbf|kN}},<ref name=\"nasa-ranger4\"/> and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base 1.5&nbsp;m in diameter. This lander (code-named ''Tonto'') was designed to provide impact cushioning using an exterior blanket of crushable balsa wood and an interior filled with incompressible liquid [[freon]]. A 42&nbsp;kg (56 pounds) {{convert|30|cm|ft|adj=mid|-diameter}} metal payload sphere floated and was free to rotate in a liquid freon reservoir contained in the landing sphere.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote=\"Everything that we do ought to really be tied-in to getting onto the Moon ahead of the Russians. ...We're ready to spend reasonable amounts of money, but we're talking about fantastic expenditures which wreck our budget and all these other domestic programs, and the only justification for it, in my opinion, to do it is because we hope to beat them and demonstrate that starting behind, as we did by a couple of years, by God, we passed them.\"|source=\u2014 [[John F.

Webb|James Webb]], NASA Deputy Administrator [[Robert Seamans]], and Special Assistant to the President [[Jerome Wiesner]] / Nov 1962, minutes 2:58\u2013ff.</ref>}}\nThis payload sphere contained six silver-[[cadmium]] batteries to power a fifty-milliwatt radio transmitter, a temperature sensitive voltage controlled oscillator to measure lunar surface temperatures, and a seismometer designed with sensitivity high enough to detect the impact of a {{convert|5|lb|kg|abbr=on}} meteorite on the opposite side of the Moon. Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere. After landing, plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere. The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere. Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator, which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch.\n\nNo cameras were carried by the Ranger landers, and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission. Instead, the {{convert|3.1|m|ft}} Ranger Block II mother ship carried a 200-scan-line television camera which was to capture images during the free-fall descent to the lunar surface. The camera was designed to transmit a picture every 10 seconds.<ref name=\"nasa-ranger4\"/> Seconds before impact, at {{convert|5|and|0.6|km|mi}} above the lunar surface, the Ranger mother ships took picture (which may be viewed [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/ranger.html here]).\n\nOther instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter. The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid-fueled braking rocket overboard from the Block II mother ship. The braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at {{convert|330|m|ft}} above the surface and separate, allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nOn Ranger 3, failure of the Atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the Agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the Moon. Attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the Moon were thwarted by in-flight failure of the onboard flight computer. This was probably because of prior [[sterilization (microbiology)|heat sterilization]] of the spacecraft by keeping it above the [[boiling]] point of water for 24 hours on the ground, to protect the Moon from being contaminated by Earth organisms. Heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in-flight failures of the spacecraft computer on Ranger 4 and the power subsystem on Ranger 5. Only Ranger 4 reached the Moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the Moon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nHeat sterilization was discontinued for the final four Block III Ranger probes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These replaced the Block II landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier, more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming Apollo crewed Moon landing missions. Six cameras were designed to take thousands of high-altitude photographs in the final twenty-minute period before crashing on the lunar surface. Camera resolution was 1,132 scan lines, far higher than the 525 lines found in a typical U.S. 1964 home television. While [[Ranger 6]] suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight, the subsequent [[Ranger 7]] mission to Mare Cognitum was a complete success.\n\nBreaking the six-year string of failures in U.S. attempts to photograph the Moon at close range, the [[Ranger 7]] mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key 1965 NASA budget appropriation to pass through the [[United States Congress]] intact without a reduction in funds for the Apollo crewed Moon landing program. Subsequent successes with [[Ranger 8]] and [[Ranger 9]] further buoyed U.S. hopes.\n\n== Soviet uncrewed soft landings (1966\u20131976) ==\n[[File:\u041b\u0443\u043d\u0430-16.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Model of Luna 16 Moon soil sample return lander]]\n[[File:Soviet moonrover.JPG|thumb|right|Model of Soviet Lunokhod automatic Moon rover]]\nThe [[Luna 9]] spacecraft, launched by the [[Soviet Union]], performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February 1966.

They removed parts of it for examination back on Earth to determine the effects of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse; \"\n|-\n! align=left | Mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Booster\n! align=center | Launch date\n! align=center | Goal\n! align=center | Result\n! align=center | Landing zone\n! align=center | [[Latitude|Lat]]/[[Longitude|Lon]]\n|-\n| [[Surveyor 1]]\n| 292\n| [[Atlas (rocket)|Atlas]] \u2013 [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]]\n| 30 May 1966\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 11,000 pictures returned, first U.S. Moon landing\n| [[Oceanus Procellarum]]\n| 002.45S 043.22W\n|-\n| [[Surveyor 2]]\n| 292\n| Atlas \u2013 Centaur\n| 20 September 1966\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 midcourse engine malfunction, placing vehicle in unrecoverable tumble; crashed southeast of Copernicus Crater\n| [[Sinus Medii]]\n| 004.00S 011.00W\n|-\n| [[Surveyor 3]]\n| 302\n| Atlas \u2013 Centaur\n| 20 April 1967\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 6,000 pictures returned; trench dug to 17.5&nbsp;cm depth after 18&nbsp;hr of robot arm use\n| Oceanus Procellarum\n| 002.94S 336.66E\n|-\n| [[Surveyor 4]]\n| 282\n| Atlas \u2013 Centaur\n| 14 July 1967\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 radio contact lost 2.5 minutes before touchdown; perfect automated Moon landing possible but outcome unknown\n| Sinus Medii\n| unknown\n|-\n| [[Surveyor 5]]\n| 303\n| Atlas \u2013 Centaur\n| 8 September 1967\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 19,000 photos returned, first use of alpha scatter soil composition monitor\n| [[Mare Tranquillitatis]]\n| 001.41N 023.18E\n|-\n| [[Surveyor 6]]\n| 300\n| Atlas \u2013 Centaur\n| 7 November 1967\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 30,000 photos returned, robot arm and alpha scatter science, engine restart, second landing 2.5&nbsp;m away from first\n| Sinus Medii\n| 000.46N 358.63E\n|-\n| [[Surveyor 7]]\n| 306\n| Atlas \u2013 Centaur\n| 7 January 1968\n| Landing\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 21,000 photos returned; robot arm and alpha scatter science; laser beams from Earth detected\n| [[Tycho (crater)|Tycho Crater]]\n| 041.01S 348.59E\n|-\n|}\n\n== Transition from direct ascent landings to lunar orbit operations ==\nWithin four months of each other in early 1966 the Soviet Union and the United States had accomplished successful Moon landings with uncrewed spacecraft. To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming crewed landers with their much greater weight.\n\nHowever, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a {{convert|50|kph|adj=on}} ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned {{convert|160|kph|adj=on}} impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a crewed flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.\n\n[[File:Space Race 1957-1975 black text.png|thumb|450px|A timeline of the space race between 1957 and 1975, with missions from the US and USSR.]]\n\nAdvances in other areas were necessary before crewed spacecraft could follow uncrewed ones to the surface of the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all flew directly to the surface without a lunar orbit. Such [[direct ascent]]s use a minimum amount of fuel for uncrewed spacecraft on a one-way trip.\n\nIn contrast, crewed vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to Earth for the crew. Leaving this massive amount of required Earth-return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a Moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again, working against lunar gravity both ways. Such considerations lead logically to a [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] mission profile for a crewed Moon landing.\n\nAccordingly, beginning in mid-1966 both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. naturally progressed into missions featuring lunar orbit as a prerequisite to a crewed Moon landing. The primary goals of these initial uncrewed orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of crewed landing sites and, for the Soviets, the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings.\n\nAn unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the Moon's [[lunar maria|maria]]. Such mass concentrations (\"[[mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]]\") can send a crewed mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe. Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low-altitude satellites around the Moon, making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years.\n\nControlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value. For example, in 1999 the NASA [[Lunar Prospector]] orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of Shoemaker Crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume detectable from Earth. No such plume was observed. However, a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist [[Eugene Shoemaker]] was delivered by the Lunar Prospector to the crater named in his honor \u2013 currently{{when|date=September 2019}} the only human remains on the Moon.\n\n== Soviet lunar orbit satellites (1966\u20131974) ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n\n! align=center | U.S.S.R. mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Booster\n! align=center | Launched\n! align=center | Mission goal\n! align=center | Mission result\n|-\n| Cosmos \u2013 111\n|\n| [[Molniya-M]]\n| align=\"right\" | 1 March 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 stranded in low Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Luna 10|Luna-10]]\n| 1,582\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 31 March 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 2,738&nbsp;km x 2,088&nbsp;km x 72 deg orbit, 178&nbsp;m period, 60-day science mission\n|-\n| [[Luna 11|Luna-11]]\n| 1,640\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 24 August 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 2,931&nbsp;km x 1,898&nbsp;km x 27 deg orbit, 178&nbsp;m period, 38-day science mission\n|-\n| [[Luna 12|Luna-12]]\n| 1,620\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 22 October 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 2,938&nbsp;km x 1,871&nbsp;km x 10 deg orbit, 205&nbsp;m period, 89-day science mission\n|-\n| Cosmos-159\n| 1,700\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 17 May 1967\n| Prototype test\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 high Earth orbit crewed landing communications gear radio calibration test\n|-\n|\n|\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 7 February 1968\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit \u2013 attempted radio calibration test?\n|-\n| [[Luna 14|Luna-14]]\n| 1,700\n| Molniya-M\n| align=\"right\" | 7 April 1968\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 870&nbsp;km x 160&nbsp;km x 42 deg orbit, 160&nbsp;m period, unstable orbit, radio calibration test?\n|-\n| [[Luna 19|Luna-19]]\n| 5,700\n| [[Proton rocket|Proton]]\n| align=\"right\" | 28 September 1971\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 140&nbsp;km x 140&nbsp;km x 41 deg orbit, 121&nbsp;m period, 388-day science mission\n|-\n| [[Luna 22|Luna-22]]\n| 5,700\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 29 May 1974\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 222&nbsp;km x 219&nbsp;km x 19 deg orbit, 130&nbsp;m period, 521-day science mission\n|-\n|}\n\n[[Luna 10]] became the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon on 3 April 1966.\n\n== U.S. lunar orbit satellites (1966\u20131967) ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n! align=left | U.S. mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Booster\n! align=center | Launched\n! align=center | Mission goal\n! align=center | Mission result\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 1]]\n| 386\n| [[Atlas (missile)|Atlas]] \u2013 [[RM-81 Agena|Agena]]\n| align=\"right\" | 10 August 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 1,160&nbsp;km X 189&nbsp;km x 12 deg orbit, 208&nbsp;m period, 80-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 2]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 6 November 1966\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 1,860&nbsp;km X 52&nbsp;km x 12 deg orbit, 208&nbsp;m period, 339-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 3]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 5 February 1967\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 1,860&nbsp;km X 52&nbsp;km x 21 deg orbit, 208&nbsp;m period, 246-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 4]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 4 May 1967\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 6,111&nbsp;km X 2,706&nbsp;km x 86 deg orbit, 721&nbsp;m period, 180-day photography mission\n|-\n| [[Lunar Orbiter 5]]\n| 386\n| Atlas \u2013 Agena\n| align=\"right\" | 1 August 1967\n| Lunar orbiter\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 6,023&nbsp;km X 195&nbsp;km x 85 deg orbit, 510&nbsp;m period, 183-day photography mission\n|-\n|}\n\n== Soviet circumlunar loop flights (1967\u20131970) ==\n{{Main|Soviet crewed lunar programs}}\n[[File:Zond Assembly.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Zond program|Zond]] mounted on top stage of Proton booster in assembly hangar]]\nIt is possible to aim a spacecraft from Earth so it will loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, following the so-called [[free return trajectory]]. Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required. However, a crewed circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges beyond those found in a crewed low-Earth-orbit mission, offering valuable lessons in preparation for a crewed Moon landing. Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere upon returning from the Moon.\n\nInhabited Earth-orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle return to Earth from speeds of around {{convert|27000|km/h|m/s|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Due to the effects of gravity, a vehicle returning from the Moon hits Earth's atmosphere at a much higher speed of around {{convert|40000|km/h|m/s|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The [[g-force|g-loading]] on astronauts during the resulting [[acceleration|deceleration]] can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry. Slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the Moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force.\n\nAchieving a crewed circumlunar loop flight prior to a crewed lunar landing became a primary goal of the Soviets with their [[Zond program|Zond]] spacecraft program. The first three Zonds were robotic planetary probes; after that, the Zond name was transferred to a completely separate human spaceflight program. The initial focus of these later Zonds was extensive testing of required high-speed reentry techniques. This focus was not shared by the U.S., who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a crewed circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose.\n\nInitial crewed spaceflights in the early 1960s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet [[Vostok programme|Vostok]] and U.S. [[Mercury program|Mercury]] programs. A two-flight extension of the Vostok program known as [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965. These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U.S. in ten [[Gemini program|Gemini]] low Earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966, using a totally new second-generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier Mercury. These Gemini missions went on to prove techniques for orbital [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous and docking]] crucial to a crewed lunar landing mission profile.\n\nAfter the end of the Gemini program, the Soviet Union began flying their second-generation Zond crewed spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him or her immediately to Earth. The [[Zond program|Zond]] spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational [[Proton rocket|Proton]] launch rocket, unlike the parallel Soviet human Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third-generation [[Soyuz spacecraft]] requiring development of the advanced [[N-1 rocket|N-1]] booster. The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a crewed Zond circumlunar flight years before a U.S. human lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory. However, significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U.S. Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort.\n\nLike Zond, Apollo flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to Earth via a circumlunar loop if a [[Apollo service module|service module]] malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit. This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the [[Apollo 13]] mission in 1970, which is the only crewed circumlunar loop mission flown to date.{{when|date=September 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse; \"\n|-\n! align=left | U.S.S.R mission\n! align=center | Mass (kg)\n! align=center | Booster\n! align=center | Launched\n! align=center | Mission goal\n! align=center | Payload\n! align=center | Mission result\n|-\n| [[Cosmos-146]]\n| 5,400\n| [[Proton rocket|Proton]]\n| align=\"right\" | 10 March 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 Successfully reached high Earth orbit, but became stranded and was unable to initiate controlled high speed atmospheric reentry test\n|-\n| [[Cosmos-154]]\n| 5,400\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 8 April 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 Successfully reached high Earth orbit, but became stranded and was unable to initiate controlled high speed atmospheric reentry test\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 28 September 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 22 November 1967\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Zond 4|Zond-4]]\n| 5,140\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 2 March 1968\n| High Earth Orbit\n| uncrewed\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 launched successfully to 300,000&nbsp;km high Earth orbit, high speed reentry test guidance malfunction, intentional self-destruct to prevent landfall outside Soviet Union\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 23 April 1968\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit; launch preparation tank explosion kills three in pad crew\n|-\n| [[Zond 5|Zond-5]]\n| 5,375\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 15 September 1968\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 looped around Moon with Earth's first near-lunar life forms, two tortoises and other live biological specimens, and the capsule and payload safely to Earth despite landing off-target outside the Soviet Union in the Indian Ocean\n|-\n| [[Zond 6|Zond-6]]\n| 5,375\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 10 November 1968\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:orange;\">Partial success</span> \u2013 looped around Moon, successful reentry, but loss of cabin air pressure caused biological payload death, parachute system malfunction and severe vehicle damage upon landing\n|-\n|\n|\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 20 January 1969\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:red;\">Failure</span> \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n|-\n| [[Zond 7|Zond-7]]\n| 5,979\n| Proton\n| align=\"right\" | 8 August 1969\n| Circumlunar Loop\n| non-human biological payload\n| <span style=\"color:green;\">Success</span> \u2013 looped around Moon, returned biological payload safely to Earth and landed on-target inside Soviet Union.

Despite the failure suffered in its final moments, the Zond 6 mission was reported by Soviet media as being a success as well. Although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements, both these Zond missions flew off-nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to humans.\n\nAs a result, the Soviets secretly planned to continue uncrewed Zond tests until their reliability to support human flight had been demonstrated. However, due to NASA's continuing problems with the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]], and because of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] reports of a potential Soviet crewed circumlunar flight in late 1968, NASA fatefully changed the flight plan of [[Apollo 8]] from an Earth-orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late December 1968.\n\nIn early December 1968 the launch window to the Moon opened for the Soviet launch site in [[Baikonur]], giving the USSR their final chance to beat the US to the Moon. [[Cosmonauts]] went on alert and asked to fly the Zond spacecraft then in final countdown at Baikonur on the first human trip to the Moon. Ultimately, however, the Soviet [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of Zond/Proton and so scrubbed the launch of a crewed Soviet lunar mission. Their decision proved to be a wise one, since this unnumbered Zond mission was destroyed in another uncrewed test when it was finally launched several weeks later.\n\nBy this time flights of the third generation U.S. [[Apollo spacecraft]] had begun. Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The [[Apollo 8]] mission carried out the first human trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the [[Saturn V]] booster for crewed use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. [[Apollo 10]] then performed a full dress rehearsal of a crewed Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within {{convert|47,400|ft|km}} of the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module too heavy to land. With the failure of the robotic Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt [[Luna 15]] in July 1969, the stage was set for [[Apollo 11]].\n\n== Human Moon landings (1969\u20131972) ==\n[[File:N1%2BSaturn5.jpg|thumb|250px|The U.S. [[Saturn V]] and the Soviet [[N1 (rocket)|N1]].]]\n\n=== US strategy ===\n{{Main|Apollo program#Political pressure builds}}\nPlans for human Moon exploration began during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration. In a series of mid-1950s articles in ''[[Collier's]]'' magazine, [[Wernher von Braun]] had popularized the idea of a crewed expedition to establish a lunar base. A human Moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the US and USSR. Besides guidance and weight management, [[atmospheric re-entry]] without [[Ablation|ablative]] overheating was a major hurdle. After the Soviets launched [[Sputnik]], von Braun promoted a plan for the US Army to establish a military lunar outpost by 1965.\n\nAfter the [[Space race#Humans in space|early Soviet successes]], especially [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s flight, US President [[John F. Kennedy]] looked for a project that would capture the public imagination. He asked Vice President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove US world leadership. The proposals included non-space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the [[Third World]]. The Soviets, at the time, had more powerful rockets than the US, which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission.\n\nAdvances in US nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller, lighter warheads; the Soviets' were much heavier, and the powerful [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] rocket was developed to carry them. More modest missions such as flying around the Moon, or a space lab in lunar orbit (both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun), offered too much advantage to the Soviets; ''landing'', however, would capture the world's imagination.\n\n[[File:Apollo Landings by Nasa.jpg|thumb|350px|Apollo landing sites]]\nJohnson had championed the US human spaceflight program ever since Sputnik, sponsoring legislation to create NASA while he was still a senator. When Kennedy asked him in 1961 to research the best achievement to counter the Soviets' lead, Johnson responded that the US had an even chance of beating them to a crewed lunar landing, but not for anything less. Kennedy seized on Apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space. He ensured continuing funding, shielding space spending from the 1963 tax cut, but diverting money from other NASA scientific projects. These diversions dismayed NASA's leader, [[James E. Webb]], who perceived the need for NASA's support from the scientific community.\n\nThe Moon landing required development of the large Saturn V [[launch vehicle]], which achieved a perfect record: zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle-caused mission failures in thirteen launches.\n\nFor the program to succeed, its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians both on the left (more money for social programs) and on the right (more money for the military). By emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of Soviet space dominance, Kennedy and Johnson managed to swing public opinion: by 1965, 58 percent of Americans favored Apollo, up from 33 percent two years earlier. After Johnson [[Assassination of President John F. Kennedy|became President in 1963]], his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in 1969, as Kennedy had planned.\n\n=== Soviet strategy ===\n{{Main|Soviet crewed lunar programs{{!}}Soviet Moonshot}}\n\nSoviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] said in October 1963 the USSR was \"not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the Moon,\" while insisting that the Soviets had not dropped out of the race. Only after another year would the USSR fully commit itself to a Moon-landing attempt, which ultimately failed.\n\nAt the same time, Kennedy had suggested various joint programs, including a possible Moon landing by Soviet and U.S. astronauts and the development of better weather-monitoring satellites. Khrushchev, sensing an attempt by Kennedy to steal Russian space technology, rejected the idea: if the USSR went to the Moon, it would go alone. [[Sergey Korolev]], the [[Soviet space program]]'s chief designer, had started promoting his [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] craft and the [[N1 (rocket)|N1]] launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a human Moon landing.\n\nKhrushchev directed Korolev's design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing Vostok technology, while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft, the Proton booster and the Zond, for a human cislunar flight in 1966. In 1964 the new Soviet leadership gave Korolev the backing for a Moon landing effort and brought all crewed projects under his direction.\n\nWith Korolev's death and the failure of the first Soyuz flight in 1967, coordination of the Soviet Moon landing program quickly unraveled. The Soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for a mission that would have placed [[Alexei Leonov]] on the Moon's surface, but with the successive launch failures of the N1 booster in 1969, plans for a crewed landing suffered first delay and then cancellation.\n\nA program of automated return vehicles was begun, in the hope of being the first to return lunar rocks. This had several failures.

Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of [[free return trajectory]]; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of crewed Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut [[Alan Bean]] is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=In the Shadow of the Moon|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=37065|publisher=comingsoon.net|accessdate=7 February 2008}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Human Moon landings ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" background: #f9f9f9; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!Mission name\n!Lunar lander\n! width=\"11%\" |Lunar landing date\n! width=\"11%\" |Lunar liftoff date\n! width=\"12%\" |Lunar landing site\n!Duration on lunar surface (DD:HH:MM)\n! width=\"25%\" |Crew\n!Number of [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]]\n!Total EVA Time (HH:MM)\n|-\n||[[Apollo 11]]\n||''Eagle''\n| align=\"right\" |20 July 1969\n| align=\"right\" |21 July 1969\n||[[Mare Tranquillitatis|Sea of Tranquility]]\n||0:21:31\n||[[Neil Armstrong]], [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin]]\n||1\n||2:31\n|-\n||[[Apollo 12]]\n||''Intrepid''\n| align=\"right\" |19 November 1969\n| align=\"right\" |21 November 1969\n||[[Oceanus Procellarum|Ocean of Storms]]\n||1:07:31\n||[[Pete Conrad|Charles \"Pete\" Conrad]], [[Alan Bean]]\n||2\n||7:45\n|-\n||[[Apollo 14]]\n||''Antares''\n| align=\"right\" |5 February 1971\n| align=\"right\" |6 February 1971\n||[[Fra Mauro formation|Fra Mauro]]\n||1:09:30\n||[[Alan Shepard|Alan B.

He is a recently divorced man who does not see his sons very often. Unbeknownst to him, he constantly crosses paths with Adrian Towers, a career woman working as a writer for the news. She is married to Steven, a man who had an abusive childhood and therefore has no desire of having children. When she announces that she is pregnant, he forces her to have an [[abortion]]. She reluctantly agrees with him, but is unable to go forward with the termination. When Steven finds out, he leaves her, and threatens to file for divorce if she decides to keep the baby.\n\nAdrian has trouble accepting that Steven leaves her and refuses to talk about it to anyone. She soon becomes acquainted with Bill. Although she likes him a lot, she is still very upset over the divorce, which will be finalized only two weeks before she goes into delivery. She accompanies Bill on a camping trip with his two sons and soon notices how much she likes kids. Although she fails to tell him about her pregnancy, they get to know each other even more. He tells her that he once was afraid to become a father, but that it changed when he first held his sons. After admitting to her that he probably never could marry again, he tries to kiss her, but she rejects him, claiming it is too soon for her.\n\nThe next morning, Tommy, one of Bill's sons, is almost hit by a car. Adrian tries to save him and pushes him away, only to be hit herself. She is injured and hospitalized, and risks to suffer a [[miscarriage]]. Bill soon learns about her pregnancy and she immediately informs him about everything concerning what has happened. He is scared by this news, but continues to support her. However, he admits that he is afraid he will fall in love with her and that she will return to Steven. Later, her lawyer informs her that Steven has no desire of ever seeing his baby and wants her to sign a contract, in which he promises to support her financially, on condition that he won't be responsible for the baby. Adrian refuses to sign it, claiming that he has to see his baby before making that decision. Crushed, she finds comfort with Bill and they end up becoming a romantic couple.\n\nA few months pass by. Adrian notices Steven in a restaurant and decides to confront him, but he refuses to speak to her. Bill advises her to accept that there is no future with Steven. The next day, she is hospitalized for having [[Contraction (childbirth)|contractions]] too early. A short time later, she decides to give in to the divorce and is proposed to by Bill. She accepts his proposal, but makes it clear that she is still not over her marriage with Steven. On [[Christmas Eve]], Adrian gives birth to a boy, who she names Sam. Steven agrees to see him and admits that he wants to renew their relationship for their child's sake. Adrian, however, rejects him. Bill, having seen Steven with her, keeps his distance.

In the age of [[digital image]]s, visual [[search engine]]s and image-organizing programs normally use thumbnails, as do most modern operating systems or desktop environments, such as [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[KDE]] ([[Linux]]) and [[GNOME]] ([[Linux]]). On web pages, they also avoid the need to download larger files unnecessarily.\n\n==Implementation==\n\nThumbnails are ideally implemented on web pages as separate, smaller copies of the original image, in part because one purpose of a thumbnail image on a web page is to reduce [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and download time. Some web designers produce thumbnails with [[HTML element|HTML]] or client-side scripting that makes the user's browser shrink the picture, rather than use a smaller copy of the image. This results in no saved bandwidth, and the visual quality of browser resizing is usually less than ideal.\nDisplaying a significant part of the picture instead of the full frame can allow the use of a smaller thumbnail while maintaining recognizability. For example, when thumbnailing a full-body [[portrait]] of a person, it may be better to show the face slightly reduced than an indistinct figure.

In the age of [[digital image]]s, visual [[search engine]]s and image-organizing programs normally use thumbnails, as do most modern operating systems or desktop environments, such as [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[KDE]] ([[Linux]]) and [[GNOME]] ([[Linux]]). On web pages, they also avoid the need to download larger files unnecessarily.\n\n==Implementation==\n\nThumbnails are ideally implemented on web pages as separate, smaller copies of the original image, in part because one purpose of a thumbnail image on a web page is to reduce [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and download time. Some web designers produce thumbnails with [[HTML element|HTML]] or client-side scripting that makes the user's browser shrink the picture, rather than use a smaller copy of the image. This results in no saved bandwidth, and the visual quality of browser resizing is usually less than ideal.\nDisplaying a significant part of the picture instead of the full frame can allow the use of a smaller thumbnail while maintaining recognizability. For example, when thumbnailing a full-body [[portrait]] of a person, it may be better to show the face slightly reduced than an indistinct figure. However, this may mislead the viewer about what the image contains, so is more suited to artistic presentations than searching or catalogue browsing.\n\nIn 2002, the court in the US case ''[[Kelly v.

{"title_page": "Wake turbulence", "text_new": "[[File:Airplane vortex edit.jpg|thumb|250px|This picture from a [[NASA]] study on wingtip vortices qualitatively illustrates the wake turbulence.]]\n'''Wake turbulence''' is a disturbance in the atmosphere that forms behind an [[aircraft]] as it passes through the air. It includes various components, the most important of which are [[wingtip vortices]] and jetwash. Jetwash refers simply to the rapidly moving gases expelled from a jet engine; it is extremely turbulent, but of short duration. Wingtip vortices, on the other hand, are much more stable and can remain in the air for up to three minutes after the passage of an aircraft. It is therefore not true [[turbulence]] in the aerodynamic sense, as true turbulence would be chaotic. Instead, it refers to the similarity to atmospheric turbulence as experienced by an aircraft flying through this region of disturbed air.\n\nWingtip vortices occur when a wing is generating lift. Air from below the wing is drawn around the wingtip into the region above the wing by the lower pressure above the wing, causing a vortex to trail from each wingtip. The strength of wingtip vortices is determined primarily by the weight and airspeed of the aircraft.<ref>https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/training/media/wake/04SEC2.PDF</ref> Wingtip vortices make up the primary and most dangerous component of wake turbulence.\n\nWake turbulence is especially hazardous in the region behind an aircraft in the [[takeoff]] or [[landing]] phases of flight. During take-off and landing, aircraft operate at high [[angle of attack]]. This flight attitude maximizes the formation of strong vortices. In the vicinity of an airport there can be multiple aircraft, all operating at low speed and low altitude, and this provides extra risk of wake turbulence with reduced height from which to recover from any upset.\n\n==Fixed wing \u2013 level flight==\nAt altitude, vortices sink at a rate of 90 to 150 [[metre]]s per minute and stabilize about 150 to 270 metres below the [[flight level]] of the generating aircraft. For this reason, aircraft operating greater than 600 metres above the terrain are considered to be at less risk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingmag.com/pilots-places/pilots-adventures-more/jumpseat-assaulted-a380|title=Jumpseat: Assaulted by an A380|author=|date=|website=flyingmag.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Helicopters==\n[[Helicopter]]s also produce wake turbulence. Helicopter wakes may be of significantly greater strength than those from a fixed wing aircraft of the same weight. The strongest wake can occur when the helicopter is operating at lower speeds (20 to 50 [[knot (unit)|knots]]). Some mid-size or executive class helicopters produce wake as strong as that of heavier helicopters. This is because two-blade main rotor systems, typical of lighter helicopters, produce a stronger wake than rotor systems with more blades. The strong rotor wake of the [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey]] [[tiltrotor]] can extend beyond the description in the manual, which [[Accidents and incidents involving the V-22 Osprey#June 2012|contributed to a crash]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://defense.aol.com/2012/08/30/afsoc-crash-report-faults-understanding-of-osprey-wake-effects/|title= AFSOC Crash Report Faults Understanding Of Osprey Rotor Wake|work= AOL Defense|date= 30 August 2012|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120923033201/http://defense.aol.com/2012/08/30/afsoc-crash-report-faults-understanding-of-osprey-wake-effects|archivedate= 23 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Parallel or crossing runways==\nDuring takeoff and landing, an aircraft's wake sinks toward the ground and moves laterally away from the runway when the wind is calm. A {{convert|3|to(-)|5|knot|mph km/h|spell=in|adj=on|0}} crosswind will tend to keep the upwind side of the wake in the runway area and may cause the downwind side to drift toward another [[runway]]. Since the wingtip vortices exist at the outer edge of an airplane's wake, this can be dangerous.\n\n==Hazard avoidance==\n\n===Wake turbulence category===\n[[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] mandates the Wake turbulence categories based upon the [[Maximum Takeoff Weight]] (MTOW) of the aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/ICAO_Wake_Turbulence_Category|title=ICAO Wake Turbulence Category - SKYbrary Aviation Safety|author=|date=|website=skybrary.aero|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref> The [[FAA]] uses a similar system, though with different weights:<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1036234|title=FAA ORDER JO 7110.65W|date=20 June 2019|accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Air Traffic Controller]]s will sequence aircraft making [[instrument approach]]es with regard to these minima. Aircraft making a visual approach are advised of the relevant recommended spacing and are expected to maintain their own separation.\n\nNotably, the [[Boeing 757]], which by its MTOW falls into Large category, is considered Heavy for purposes of separation because of a number of incidents where smaller aircraft lost control (with some crashing) while following too closely behind a 757.<ref name=B757>{{citation|url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/215246|title=FAA Order N JO 7110.525|date=8 April 2010|accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nCommon minima are:\n\n;Take-off\nAn aircraft of a lower wake vortex category must not be allowed to take off less than two minutes behind an aircraft of a higher wake vortex category. If the following aircraft does not start its take off roll from the same point as the preceding aircraft, this is increased to three minutes. To put this more generally, an aircraft is usually safer if it is airborne before the rotation point of the airplane that took off before it. However, care must be taken to stay upwind (or otherwise away) from any vortices that were generated by the previous aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boldmethod.com/learn-to-fly/aerodynamics/avoid-wake-turbulence-during-takeoff-and-landing/|title=How A Single-Engine Aircraft Created A Wake Turbulence Accident During Takeoff|author=|date=|website=boldmethod.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n;Landing<ref name=\"FG_2008_sep_distances\">{{Cite news|title=New guidelines show shorter A380&nbsp;separation distances|publisher=Flight International|date=22 August 2008|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/08/22/315062/new-guidelines-show-shorter-a380-separation-distances.html|accessdate=6 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905163252/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/08/22/315062/new-guidelines-show-shorter-a380-separation-distances.html|archivedate=5 September 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=The cited article does not list separation minimums; such information is found in AC 90-23G published by the FAA|date=July 2014}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The FAA's overall plan is to slowly phase in more complex factors to allow reduced wake separation, in order to increase capacity. RECAT Phase I (first demonstrated in Memphis), introduces 6 static wake turbulence categories to replace the traditional weight classes. The FAA used [[maximum takeoff weight]], [[maximum landing weight]], wingspan, and approach speed in Phase I in order to more accurately represent the wake severity of a generating aircraft, as well as the vulnerability of trailing aircraft to a potential wake encounter. This analysis enables the development of more efficient wake turbulence separation minima than those specified in the baseline operational rules specified in [https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Order/ATC.pdf FAA Order JO 7110.65]. As of April 2016, RECAT Phase I has been implemented at 10 [[TRACON]] and 17 airport locations.\n\nRECAT Phase II is a continuation of the RECAT program that focuses on a larger variety of aircraft (123 ICAO type designators that make up more than 99% of US air traffic movements based on 32 US airports), as opposed to the 61 aircraft comprising 85% of operations from 5 US and 3 European airports that were used in RECAT Phase I. The fundamental underlying wake separations in RECAT Phase II are not defined per wake turbulence category, but actual individual pairs of make-model-series aircraft types (e.g. [[Boeing 747-400|Boeing B747-400]] leading [[Airbus A321]]). In the US, automation does not yet exist to allow air traffic controllers to utilize this pairwise separation matrix. Instead, RECAT Phase II takes advantage of the underlying matrix to redefine the RECAT Phase I-type categories (i.e. Categories A \u2013 F, with an additional Category G) for individual TRACONs. This allows further efficiency gains over RECAT I because it takes the fleet mix \u2013 which aircraft fly most often \u2013 into account for each site, rather than doing a global optimization for the US national airspace system as a whole.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Jillian|year=2016|title=The Development of Wake Turbulence Recategorization in the United States|url=https://ntl.bts.gov/lib/59000/59300/59389/AIAA_2016_3434.pdf|journal=AIAA Aviation|volume=2016\u20133434|pages=1\u201312|via=}}</ref> RECAT Phase II went operational on August 3, 2016 at Southern California TRACON and associated towers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1029781|title=Order JO 7110.123|date=August 2, 2016|website=FAA|access-date=October 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the largest global wake database,<ref>{{cite web|title=RECAT-EU - European Wake Turbulence Categorisation and Separation Minima on Approach and Departure, Edition: 1.1, Edition date: 15/07/2015, Appendix A - Rationale of RECAT-EU design methodology, Par 4 |url=https://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/content/documents/sesar/recat-eu-released-september-2015.pdf|website=EUROCONTROL}}</ref> [[Eurocontrol|EUROCONTROL]] has developed advanced wake metrics to set up the European six category wake turbulence separation minima, RECAT-EU, as an alternative to the long established [[ICAO]] PANS-ATM categories, in order to safely support an increase in runway throughput at airports in Europe.

Light aircraft pilots must use extreme caution and intercept their final approach path above or well behind the heavier aircraft's path. When a visual approach following a preceding aircraft is issued and accepted, the pilot is required to establish a safe landing interval behind the aircraft he was instructed to follow. The pilot is responsible for wake turbulence separation. Pilots must not decrease the separation that existed when the visual approach was issued unless they can remain on or above the flight path of the preceding aircraft. Having a higher approach path and touching down further along the runway than the previous aircraft will help avoid wake turbulence.\n\n[[Glider (sailplane)|Glider]] pilots routinely practice flying in wingtip vortices when they do a maneuver called \"boxing the wake.\" This involves descending from the higher to lower position behind a tow plane. This is followed by making a rectangular figure by holding the glider at high and low points away from the towing plane before coming back up through the vortices. (For safety this is not done below {{convert|1500|ft|disp=or|}} above the ground, and usually with an instructor present.) Given the relatively slow speeds and lightness of both aircraft the procedure is safe but does instill a sense of how strong and where the turbulence is located.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soaringsafety.org/learning/towpilot/tpc5.htm|title=TOW PILOT TRAINING COURSE Page 5|author=|date=|website=soaringsafety.org|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Warning signs===\nAny uncommanded aircraft movements (such as wing rocking) may be caused by wake. This is why maintaining situational awareness is critical. Ordinary turbulence is not unusual, particularly in the approach phase. A pilot who suspects wake turbulence is affecting his or her aircraft should get away from the wake, execute a [[missed approach]] or go-around and be prepared for a stronger wake encounter. The onset of wake can be insidious and even surprisingly gentle. There have been serious accidents (see the next section) where pilots have attempted to salvage a landing after encountering moderate wake only to encounter severe wake turbulence that they were unable to overcome. Pilots should not depend on any aerodynamic warning, but if the onset of wake is occurring, immediate evasive action is vital.\n\n==Incidents involving wake turbulence==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}\n[[File:North American XB-70A Valkyrie just after collision 061122-F-1234P-037.jpg|thumb|right|XB-70 ''62-0207'' following the [[Mid-air collision|midair collision]] on 8 June 1966.]]\n\n*8 June 1966 \u2013 an [[XB-70]] collided with an [[F-104]].

This is the strong core of the vortex. If the aircraft produces a weaker vortex, the breakup will sound like tearing a piece of paper. Often, it is first noticed some seconds after the direct noise of the passing aircraft has diminished. The sound then gets louder. Nevertheless, being highly directional, wake turbulence sound is easily perceived as originating a considerable distance behind the aircraft, its apparent source moving across the sky just as the aircraft did. It can persist for 30 seconds or more, continually changing timbre, sometimes with swishing and cracking notes, until it finally dies away.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Original research|Section|date=September 2010}}\nIn the 1986 film ''[[Top Gun]]'', Lieutenant Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, played by [[Tom Cruise]], suffers two [[flameout]]s caused by passing through the jetwash of another aircraft, piloted by fellow aviator Tom \"Ice Man\" Kazansky (played by [[Val Kilmer]]). As a result, he is put into an unrecoverable spin and is forced to eject, killing his RIO Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw. In a subsequent incident, he is caught in an enemy fighter's jetwash, but manages to recover safely.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Pushing Tin]]'', air traffic controllers stand just off the threshold of a runway while an aircraft lands in order to experience wake turbulence firsthand. However, the film dramatically exaggerates the effect of turbulence on persons standing on the ground, showing the protagonists being blown about by the passing aircraft. In reality, the turbulence behind and below a landing aircraft is too gentle to knock over a person standing on the ground. (In contrast, [[jet blast]] from an aircraft ''taking off'' can be extremely dangerous to people standing behind the aircraft.)\n\n==See also==\n<!-- alphabetical order -->\n*[[Batchelor vortex]]\n*[[Eddy (fluid dynamics)]]\n*[[Wake]] (of boats)\n*[[Wingtip device]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.usatoday.com/travel/columnist/getline/2005-06-01-column_x.htm Captain Meryl Getline explains \"Heavy\"]\n* [https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_3.html U.S. FAA, The Aeronautical Information Manual on Wake Turbulence]\n* [https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/pcg_8-15-19.pdf U.S. FAA, Pilot Controller Glossary, see ''Aircraft Classes'']\n* [http://www.avweb.com/news/airman/183095-1.html Wake Turbulence, An Invisible Enemy]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/birdlike/sets/72157606837430429/ Photographs of Wake turbulence]\n* [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/about/Organizations/Technology/Facts/TF-2004-14-DFRC.html NASA Dryden \u2013 Wake Vortex Research]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wake Turbulence}}\n[[Category:Aviation risks]]\n[[Category:Air traffic control]]\n[[Category:Turbulence]]\n[[Category:Aircraft wing design]]\n\n[[ca:Estela]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Airplane vortex edit.jpg|thumb|250px|This picture from a [[NASA]] study on wingtip vortices qualitatively illustrates the wake turbulence.]]\n'''Wake turbulence''' is a disturbance in the atmosphere that forms behind an [[aircraft]] as it passes through the air. It includes various components, the most important of which are [[wingtip vortices]] and jetwash. Jetwash refers simply to the rapidly moving gases expelled from a jet engine; it is extremely turbulent, but of short duration. Wingtip vortices, on the other hand, are much more stable and can remain in the air for up to three minutes after the passage of an aircraft. It is therefore not true [[turbulence]] in the aerodynamic sense, as true turbulence would be chaotic. Instead, it refers to the similarity to atmospheric turbulence as experienced by an aircraft flying through this region of disturbed air.\n\nWingtip vortices occur when a wing is generating lift. Air from below the wing is drawn around the wingtip into the region above the wing by the lower pressure above the wing, causing a vortex to trail from each wingtip. The strength of wingtip vortices is determined primarily by the weight and airspeed of the aircraft.<ref>https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/training/media/wake/04SEC2.PDF</ref> Wingtip vortices make up the primary and most dangerous component of wake turbulence.\n\nWake turbulence is especially hazardous in the region behind an aircraft in the [[takeoff]] or [[landing]] phases of flight. During take-off and landing, aircraft operate at high [[angle of attack]]. This flight attitude maximizes the formation of strong vortices. In the vicinity of an airport there can be multiple aircraft, all operating at low speed and low altitude, and this provides extra risk of wake turbulence with reduced height from which to recover from any upset.\n\n==Fixed wing \u2013 level flight==\nAt altitude, vortices sink at a rate of 90 to 150 [[metre]]s per minute and stabilize about 150 to 270 metres below the [[flight level]] of the generating aircraft. For this reason, aircraft operating greater than 600 metres above the terrain are considered to be at less risk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingmag.com/pilots-places/pilots-adventures-more/jumpseat-assaulted-a380|title=Jumpseat: Assaulted by an A380|author=|date=|website=flyingmag.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Helicopters==\n[[Helicopter]]s also produce wake turbulence. Helicopter wakes may be of significantly greater strength than those from a fixed wing aircraft of the same weight. The strongest wake can occur when the helicopter is operating at lower speeds (20 to 50 [[knot (unit)|knots]]). Some mid-size or executive class helicopters produce wake as strong as that of heavier helicopters. This is because two-blade main rotor systems, typical of lighter helicopters, produce a stronger wake than rotor systems with more blades. The strong rotor wake of the [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey]] [[tiltrotor]] can extend beyond the description in the manual, which [[Accidents and incidents involving the V-22 Osprey#June 2012|contributed to a crash]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://defense.aol.com/2012/08/30/afsoc-crash-report-faults-understanding-of-osprey-wake-effects/|title= AFSOC Crash Report Faults Understanding Of Osprey Rotor Wake|work= AOL Defense|date= 30 August 2012|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120923033201/http://defense.aol.com/2012/08/30/afsoc-crash-report-faults-understanding-of-osprey-wake-effects|archivedate= 23 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Parallel or crossing runways==\nDuring takeoff and landing, an aircraft's wake sinks toward the ground and moves laterally away from the runway when the wind is calm. A {{convert|3|to(-)|5|knot|mph km/h|spell=in|adj=on|0}} crosswind will tend to keep the upwind side of the wake in the runway area and may cause the downwind side to drift toward another [[runway]]. Since the wingtip vortices exist at the outer edge of an airplane's wake, this can be dangerous.\n\n==Hazard avoidance==\n\n===Wake turbulence category===\n[[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] mandates the Wake turbulence categories based upon the [[Maximum Takeoff Weight]] (MTOW) of the aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/ICAO_Wake_Turbulence_Category|title=ICAO Wake Turbulence Category - SKYbrary Aviation Safety|author=|date=|website=skybrary.aero|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref> The [[FAA]] uses a similar system, though with different weights:<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1036234|title=FAA ORDER JO 7110.65W|date=20 June 2019|accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Air Traffic Controller]]s will sequence aircraft making [[instrument approach]]es with regard to these minima. Aircraft making a visual approach are advised of the relevant recommended spacing and are expected to maintain their own separation.\n\nNotably, the [[Boeing 757]], which by its MTOW falls into Large category, is considered Heavy for purposes of separation because of a number of incidents where smaller aircraft lost control (with some crashing) while following too closely behind a 757.<ref name=B757>{{citation|url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/215246|title=FAA Order N JO 7110.525|date=8 April 2010|accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nCommon minima are:\n\n;Take-off\nAn aircraft of a lower wake vortex category must not be allowed to take off less than two minutes behind an aircraft of a higher wake vortex category.

However, care must be taken to stay upwind (or otherwise away) from any vortices that were generated by the previous aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boldmethod.com/learn-to-fly/aerodynamics/avoid-wake-turbulence-during-takeoff-and-landing/|title=How A Single-Engine Aircraft Created A Wake Turbulence Accident During Takeoff|author=|date=|website=boldmethod.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n;Landing<ref name=\"FG_2008_sep_distances\">{{Cite news|title=New guidelines show shorter A380&nbsp;separation distances|publisher=Flight International|date=22 August 2008|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/08/22/315062/new-guidelines-show-shorter-a380-separation-distances.html|accessdate=6 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905163252/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/08/22/315062/new-guidelines-show-shorter-a380-separation-distances.html|archivedate=5 September 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=The cited article does not list separation minimums; such information is found in AC 90-23G published by the FAA|date=July 2014}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The FAA's overall plan is to slowly phase in more complex factors to allow reduced wake separation, in order to increase capacity. RECAT Phase I (first demonstrated in Memphis), introduces 6 static wake turbulence categories to replace the traditional weight classes. The FAA used [[maximum takeoff weight]], [[maximum landing weight]], wingspan, and approach speed in Phase I in order to more accurately represent the wake severity of a generating aircraft, as well as the vulnerability of trailing aircraft to a potential wake encounter. This analysis enables the development of more efficient wake turbulence separation minima than those specified in the baseline operational rules specified in [https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Order/ATC.pdf FAA Order JO 7110.65]. As of April 2016, RECAT Phase I has been implemented at 10 [[TRACON]] and 17 airport locations.\n\nRECAT Phase II is a continuation of the RECAT program that focuses on a larger variety of aircraft (123 ICAO type designators that make up more than 99% of US air traffic movements based on 32 US airports), as opposed to the 61 aircraft comprising 85% of operations from 5 US and 3 European airports that were used in RECAT Phase I. The fundamental underlying wake separations in RECAT Phase II are not defined per wake turbulence category, but actual individual pairs of make-model-series aircraft types (e.g. [[Boeing 747-400|Boeing B747-400]] leading [[Airbus A321]]). In the US, automation does not yet exist to allow air traffic controllers to utilize this pairwise separation matrix. Instead, RECAT Phase II takes advantage of the underlying matrix to redefine the RECAT Phase I-type categories (i.e. Categories A \u2013 F, with an additional Category G) for individual TRACONs. This allows further efficiency gains over RECAT I because it takes the fleet mix \u2013 which aircraft fly most often \u2013 into account for each site, rather than doing a global optimization for the US national airspace system as a whole.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Jillian|year=2016|title=The Development of Wake Turbulence Recategorization in the United States|url=https://ntl.bts.gov/lib/59000/59300/59389/AIAA_2016_3434.pdf|journal=AIAA Aviation|volume=2016\u20133434|pages=1\u201312|via=}}</ref> RECAT Phase II went operational on August 3, 2016 at Southern California TRACON and associated towers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1029781|title=Order JO 7110.123|date=August 2, 2016|website=FAA|access-date=October 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the largest global wake database,<ref>{{cite web|title=RECAT-EU - European Wake Turbulence Categorisation and Separation Minima on Approach and Departure, Edition: 1.1, Edition date: 15/07/2015, Appendix A - Rationale of RECAT-EU design methodology, Par 4 |url=https://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/content/documents/sesar/recat-eu-released-september-2015.pdf|website=EUROCONTROL}}</ref> [[Eurocontrol|EUROCONTROL]] has developed advanced wake metrics to set up the European six category wake turbulence separation minima, RECAT-EU, as an alternative to the long established [[ICAO]] PANS-ATM categories, in order to safely support an increase in runway throughput at airports in Europe.

Light aircraft pilots must use extreme caution and intercept their final approach path above or well behind the heavier aircraft's path. When a visual approach following a preceding aircraft is issued and accepted, the pilot is required to establish a safe landing interval behind the aircraft he was instructed to follow. The pilot is responsible for wake turbulence separation. Pilots must not decrease the separation that existed when the visual approach was issued unless they can remain on or above the flight path of the preceding aircraft. Having a higher approach path and touching down further along the runway than the previous aircraft will help avoid wake turbulence.\n\n[[Glider (sailplane)|Glider]] pilots routinely practice flying in wingtip vortices when they do a maneuver called \"boxing the wake.\" This involves descending from the higher to lower position behind a tow plane. This is followed by making a rectangular figure by holding the glider at high and low points away from the towing plane before coming back up through the vortices. (For safety this is not done below {{convert|1500|ft|disp=or|}} above the ground, and usually with an instructor present.) Given the relatively slow speeds and lightness of both aircraft the procedure is safe but does instill a sense of how strong and where the turbulence is located.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soaringsafety.org/learning/towpilot/tpc5.htm|title=TOW PILOT TRAINING COURSE Page 5|author=|date=|website=soaringsafety.org|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Warning signs===\nAny uncommanded aircraft movements (such as wing rocking) may be caused by wake. This is why maintaining situational awareness is critical. Ordinary turbulence is not unusual, particularly in the approach phase. A pilot who suspects wake turbulence is affecting his or her aircraft should get away from the wake, execute a [[missed approach]] or go-around and be prepared for a stronger wake encounter. The onset of wake can be insidious and even surprisingly gentle. There have been serious accidents (see the next section) where pilots have attempted to salvage a landing after encountering moderate wake only to encounter severe wake turbulence that they were unable to overcome. Pilots should not depend on any aerodynamic warning, but if the onset of wake is occurring, immediate evasive action is vital.\n\n==Incidents involving wake turbulence==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}\n[[File:North American XB-70A Valkyrie just after collision 061122-F-1234P-037.jpg|thumb|right|XB-70 ''62-0207'' following the [[Mid-air collision|midair collision]] on 8 June 1966.]]\n\n*8 June 1966 \u2013 an [[XB-70]] collided with an [[F-104]].

Currently, ICAO recognizes two methods of measurement, sound tomography, and a high-resolution technique is [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] [[lidar]], a solution now commercially available. Techniques using [[optics]] can use the effect of turbulence on [[refractive index]] ([[optical turbulence]]) to measure the distortion of light that passes through the turbulent area and indicate the strength of that turbulence.\n\n==Audibility==\n{{listen|\nfilename=2011-06-05_19-32_Berlin_TXL_Airplane_Flyover_plus_Wingtip_Vortex.ogg|\ntitle=Airplane flyover followed by wake turbulence|\ndescription=A subtle rustling and cracking sound caused by the wake vortices after airplane flyover.

This is the strong core of the vortex. If the aircraft produces a weaker vortex, the breakup will sound like tearing a piece of paper. Often, it is first noticed some seconds after the direct noise of the passing aircraft has diminished. The sound then gets louder. Nevertheless, being highly directional, wake turbulence sound is easily perceived as originating a considerable distance behind the aircraft, its apparent source moving across the sky just as the aircraft did. It can persist for 30 seconds or more, continually changing timbre, sometimes with swishing and cracking notes, until it finally dies away.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Original research|Section|date=September 2010}}\nIn the 1986 film ''[[Top Gun]]'', Lieutenant Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, played by [[Tom Cruise]], suffers two [[flameout]]s caused by passing through the jetwash of another aircraft, piloted by fellow aviator Tom \"Ice Man\" Kazansky (played by [[Val Kilmer]]). As a result, he is put into an unrecoverable spin and is forced to eject, killing his RIO Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw. In a subsequent incident, he is caught in an enemy fighter's jetwash, but manages to recover safely.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Pushing Tin]]'', air traffic controllers stand just off the threshold of a runway while an aircraft lands in order to experience wake turbulence firsthand. However, the film dramatically exaggerates the effect of turbulence on persons standing on the ground, showing the protagonists being blown about by the passing aircraft. In reality, the turbulence behind and below a landing aircraft is too gentle to knock over a person standing on the ground. (In contrast, [[jet blast]] from an aircraft ''taking off'' can be extremely dangerous to people standing behind the aircraft.)\n\n==See also==\n<!-- alphabetical order -->\n*[[Batchelor vortex]]\n*[[Eddy (fluid dynamics)]]\n*[[Wake]] (of boats)\n*[[Wingtip device]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.usatoday.com/travel/columnist/getline/2005-06-01-column_x.htm Captain Meryl Getline explains \"Heavy\"]\n* [https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_3.html U.S. FAA, The Aeronautical Information Manual on Wake Turbulence]\n* [https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/pcg_8-15-19.pdf U.S. FAA, Pilot Controller Glossary, see ''Aircraft Classes'']\n* [http://www.avweb.com/news/airman/183095-1.html Wake Turbulence, An Invisible Enemy]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/birdlike/sets/72157606837430429/ Photographs of Wake turbulence]\n* [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/about/Organizations/Technology/Facts/TF-2004-14-DFRC.html NASA Dryden \u2013 Wake Vortex Research]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wake Turbulence}}\n[[Category:Aviation risks]]\n[[Category:Air traffic control]]\n[[Category:Turbulence]]\n[[Category:Aircraft wing design]]\n\n[[ca:Estela]]\n", "name_user": "Missing975", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWake Turbulence Recategorization Separation Standards", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_turbulence"}

In 2010, he and his friend and fellow actor Silambarasan released the song \"Evan Di Unna Pethan\" from the film ''Vaanam'' (2011) as a single, which generated the trend of releasing single tracks from film soundtracks in Tamil cinema several months prior to the actual release,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/article2701259.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Showbitz&nbsp;\u2013 Moving to direction | date=9 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/74555.html |title=Hit mantra of soup boys |publisher=IndiaGlitz |date=25 November 2011 |accessdate=13 July 2012}}</ref> although the first single in Tamil cinema had been released in 2001 already.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2002/10/25/stories/2002102501150300.htm |title=The Hindu : Fame on a platter |newspaper=The Hindu |date=25 October 2002 |accessdate=13 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nYuvan Shankar Raja married his girlfriend Sujaya Chandran on 21 March 2005, at the Mayor Sri Ramanathan Chettiyar Hall in [[Chennai]], India.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/lf/2005/03/22/stories/2005032211030200.htm|title=Yuvanshankar Raja weds Sujaya Chandran|work=The Hindu |accessdate=15 August 2009|location=Chennai, India|date=22 March 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilweek.com/Illaiyarajah_Son_Yuvan_Weds_Grand_Daughter_of_Jaffna.html|title=Illaiyarajah's son Yuvan Weds Grand Daughter of Jaffna|publisher=tamilweek.com|accessdate=15 August 2009}}</ref> Yuvan had met her in 2002 as a fan at a music cultural program in London and both fell in love later.<ref name=\"DivorceOneindia\">{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/tamil/exclusive/yuvan-sujaya-file-divorce-papers-090807.html|title=Yuvan submits divorce papers!|publisher=[[Oneindia]]|accessdate=15 August 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218033520/http://entertainment.oneindia.in/tamil/exclusive/yuvan-sujaya-file-divorce-papers-090807.html|archivedate=18 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Sujaya was a London-based singer and the daughter of Dr. C.

The biggest movement of domestic tourists is during the annual [[Eid ul-Fitr]], locally known as ''[[lebaran]]''. During this period, which is a two-week holiday after the month of [[fasting during Ramadan]], many city-dwelling [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim Indonesians]] visit relatives in their home towns. Intercity traffic is at its peak and often an additional surcharge is applied during this time.\n\nOver the five years up to 2006, attention has been focused on generating more domestic tourism. Competition amongst [[budget airlines]] has increased the number of domestic air travellers throughout the country. Recently, the Ministry of Labour legislated to create long weekends by combining [[Public holidays in Indonesia|public holidays]] that fall close to weekends, except in the case of important religious holidays. During these long weekends, most hotels in popular destinations are fully booked.\n\nSince 2000, on average, there have been five million foreign tourists each year (see table), who spend an average of {{USD|100}} per day.

The 15th-century travelogue of [[Bujangga Manik]], a travelling Hindu scholar-priest from [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], reported about his travel around Java and Bali. Although his travel was a pilgrimage one; visiting temples and sacred places in Java and Bali, sometimes he behaves like a modern-day tourist, such as sitting around fanning his body while enjoying beautiful mountain scenery in [[Puncak]] area, looking at [[Mount Gede|Gede volcano]] that he describes as the highest point around Pakuan Pajajaran (capital of [[Sunda kingdom]]).<ref>{{cite book\n| last =Noorduyn\n| first =J.\n| publisher= KITLV Press\n| title = Three Old Sundanese poems\n| year =2006\n| page =\n}}</ref>\n[[File:Hotel Savoy Homann (27166453832).jpg|thumb|right|[[Savoy Homann Bidakara Hotel|Hotel Savoy Homann]] (completed 1939) in [[Bandung]], an example of [[Art Deco]] buildings in Indonesia]]\nInitially the tourism, service and hospitality sector in [[Dutch East Indies]] were developed to cater the lodging, entertainment and leisure needs of domestic visitors, especially the wealthy Dutch plantation owners and merchants during their stay in the city. In the 19th century, colonial heritage hotels equipped with dance halls, live music and fine dining restaurants were established in Dutch East Indies urban areas, such as [[Hotel des Indes (Batavia)|Hotel des Indes]] (est. 1829) in Batavia (now Jakarta), [[Savoy Homann Bidakara Hotel|Savoy Homann Hotel]] (est. 1871) in Bandung, [[Hotel Majapahit|Hotel Oranje]] (est. 1910) in Surabaya, and Hotel De Boer in Medan.

The 1930s did see a modest but significant influx of mainly European tourists and longer term stayers to Bali. Many came for the blossoming arts scene in the [[Ubud]] area, which was as much a two-way exchange between the Balinese and outsiders as it was an internal phenomenon.<ref>Robert Cribb, 'International tourism in Java, 1900\u20131930, ''South East Asian Research'' 3 no 2 (1995), pp. 193-204. {{ISSN|0967-828X}}</ref>\n[[File:Hotel Indonesia, photographed at dusk; December 2014.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hotel Indonesia]] (est. 1962), one of the earliest high-rise buildings in Jakarta]]\n\nTourism more or less disappeared during [[World War II]], [[Indonesian National Revolution]] and in the early years of the [[Sukarno]] era.

Although Indonesia has many world-class surfing spots, the majority of surfers come from abroad, especially Australia and United States. However, enthusiasm for local surfing began in Bali and West Java's [[Pelabuhan Ratu]] and [[Pangandaran]] beach, with most surfers arriving from nearby cities of Jakarta and Bandung.\n\nIn 2018, [[World Surf League]] has had 8 surfing events in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2018/11/21/tourism-ministry-to-hold-11-surfing-competitions-in-2019.html |title=Tourism Ministry to hold 11 surfing competitions in 2019 |date=November 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn Bali, there are about 33 surf locations, from West Bali to East Bali including four on the offshore island of [[Nusa Lembongan]].

High season for surfing is around May to September with the trade winds blowing from east to south-east. From October to April, winds tend to come from the west to north-west, so the east coast breaks get the offshore winds.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nTwo well-known surf breaks in Indonesia are the [[G-Land]] in the Bay of Grajagan, [[East Java]], and [[Lagundri Bay]] at the southern end of [[Nias]] island. G-Land was first identified in 1972, when a surfer saw the break from the window of a plane. Since 6 to 8-foot ([[Hawaiian scale]]) waves were discovered by surfers at Lagundri Bay in 1975, the island has become famous for surfing worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n=== National parks ===\n{{Main|List of national parks of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Komodo dragon at Komodo National Park Indonesia.jpg|thumb|[[Komodo dragon]] at [[Komodo National Park]]]]\n[[Bogor Botanical Gardens]] established in 1817, and [[Cibodas Botanical Gardens]] established in 1862, are two among the oldest botanical gardens in Asia. With rich collections of tropical plants, these gardens is the centre of botanical research as well as tourism attraction since colonial era.\n\nThere are 50 national parks in Indonesia, of which six are [[UNESCO World Heritage|World Heritage]] listed.

Other national parks on the list are [[Lorentz National Park]] in [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]], [[Komodo National Park]] in the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], and [[Ujung Kulon National Park]] in the west of [[Java]].\n\nTo be noticed, different national parks offer different biodiversity, as the natural habitat in Indonesia is divided into two areas by the [[Wallace line]]. The [[Wallacea]] [[biogeographical]] distinction means the western part of Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan) have the same flora and fauna characteristics as the Asian continent, whilst the remaining eastern part of Indonesia has similarity with the Australian continent.<ref name=\"nytimes1\" />\n\nMany native species such as [[Sumatran elephant]]s, [[Sumatran tiger]]s, [[Sumatran rhinoceros]], [[Javan rhinoceros]] and [[orangutans]] are listed as [[endangered species|endangered]] or [[critically endangered]], and the remaining populations are found in [[List of national parks of Indonesia|national parks]] and other conservation areas. [[Sumatran orangutan]] can be visited in the [[Bukit Lawang]] conservation area, while the [[Bornean orangutan]] can be visited in [[Tanjung Puting]] national park, Central Kalimantan.

The indigenous ethnic group of [[Toraja]] in [[South Sulawesi]], still has a strong tradition that descends from [[animism|animistic]] beliefs even though most Toraja are [[Christians|Christian]] now. One of the most famous Toraja tradition is their funeral rites, [[Rambu Solo]].

Along the Indonesian classical history of Hindu-Buddhist era, they produced some temples and monuments called ''candi''. The best-preserved Buddhist shrine, which was built during the [[Sailendra]] dynasty in the 8th century, is [[Borobudur]] temple in [[Central Java]]. A giant stone [[mandala]] stepped pyramid adorned with bell-shaped [[stupa]]s, richly adorned with bas-reliefs telling the stories and teachings of Buddha.\n[[File:Candi Sewu viewed from the south, 23 November 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Sewu]] Mahayana Buddhist temple near Prambanan, Central Java]]\nA few kilometers to the southeast is the [[Prambanan]] complex, the largest Hindu temple in Indonesia built during the second [[Mataram Kingdom|Mataram]] dynasty.<ref name=\"nytimes1\" /> The Prambanan temple is dedicated to [[Trimurti]]; [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Brahma]], three highest gods in Hinduism. Both the [[Borobudur]] and the [[Prambanan]] temple compounds have been listed in the UNESCO [[World Heritage]] list since 1991.

The tourism industry in Indonesia has also faced setbacks due to problems related to security. Since 2002, warnings have been issued by some countries over terrorist threats and ethnic as well as religious conflicts in some areas, significantly reducing the number of foreign visitors for a few years.

The biggest movement of domestic tourists is during the annual [[Eid ul-Fitr]], locally known as ''[[lebaran]]''. During this period, which is a two-week holiday after the month of [[fasting during Ramadan]], many city-dwelling [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim Indonesians]] visit relatives in their home towns. Intercity traffic is at its peak and often an additional surcharge is applied during this time.\n\nOver the five years up to 2006, attention has been focused on generating more domestic tourism. Competition amongst [[budget airlines]] has increased the number of domestic air travellers throughout the country. Recently, the Ministry of Labour legislated to create long weekends by combining [[Public holidays in Indonesia|public holidays]] that fall close to weekends, except in the case of important religious holidays.

The 15th-century travelogue of [[Bujangga Manik]], a travelling Hindu scholar-priest from [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], reported about his travel around Java and Bali.

Many other guide books have been produced in English and other languages.\n\nMajor international newspapers regularly have travel sections and stories about Indonesia.<ref name=\"nytimes1\" /> The journalists of tourism in Indonesia joined in the [[Indonesian Tourism Journalist Association]] (ITJA),<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://pelitajabaronline.com/?page=view&id=20170119205454|title=ITJA, Wadah Wartawan Pariwisata|website=Pelitajabaronline.com|access-date=15 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818090507/http://pelitajabaronline.com/?page=view&id=20170119205454|archive-date=18 August 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Indonesian journalists active enough to write a variety of tourism information about the uniqueness found in this country.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:KA Padang Panjang (train).jpg|[[Lake Singkarak]], West Sumatera\nFile:New Pagaruyung Palace.JPG|[[Pagaruyung Palace]], West Sumatera\nFile:Kelimutu 2007-07-21.jpg|Mount [[Kelimutu]] crater lakes, East Nusa Tenggara\nFile:Kawah Putih Lake from the viewing platform, Bandung Regency, 2014-08-21.jpg|[[Kawah Putih]], West Java\nFile:Sunrise at Eastern Pangandaran Beach.jpg|[[Pangandaran]] Beach, West Java\nFile:A beautiful sunset HDR (7120762005).jpg|[[Parangtritis]] Beach, [[Yogyakarta]]\nFile:Gili Meno West Coast.jpg|The beach at [[Gili Meno]] with [[Lombok]] in the distant background\nFile:FishingKarimun.jpg|Fishing boats in the main harbour [[Karimunjawa]]\nFile:Ternate Volcano view from Dodoku Ali.jpg|[[Ternate]], North Maluku\nFile:Gedong songo.jpg|[[Gedong Songo]] Temples, Ungaran, Central Java\nFile:Ambarawa locomotief.jpg|[[Ambarawa Railway Museum]], Central Java\nFile:Bajang Ratu Gate Trowulan.jpg|[[Trowulan]] archaeological site, East Java\nFile:The Equatorial Monument in Pontianak.jpg|[[Equator monument]] in Pontianak.\nFile:Saronde Island 1.jpg|[[Saronde Island]], Gorontalo\nFile:Sea Garden of BUNAKEN.jpg|[[Bunaken]] marine park, North Sulawesi\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n* [[Alcohol in Indonesia]]\n* [[Transport in Indonesia]]\n* [[Visa policy of Indonesia]]\n* [[:Category:World Heritage Sites in Indonesia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book|last=_|title=Come to Java 1922\u201323|publisher=Weltevreden : Official Tourist Bureau|year=1922}}\n* {{Cite book|author=Adams, Kathleen M.| title=Art as Politics: Re-crafting Identities, Tourism and Power in Tana Toraja, Indonesia. |location=Honolulu| publisher=University of Hawaii Press| year=2006|isbn= 978-0-8248-3072-4}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Buckles|first=Guy|title=The Dive Sites of Indonesia|publisher=New Holland|year=1996|isbn=1-85368-598-4}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Indonesia|last=Elliot|first=Mark|publisher=Lonely Planet|date=November 2003|isbn=1-74059-154-2}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Java: A Travellers' Anthology|last=Rush|first=James R.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|isbn=967-65-3082-4}}\n* {{Cite book|last=McCarthy|first=John|title=Are sweet dreams made of this? : Tourism in Bali and Eastern Indonesia|publisher=Indonesia Resources and Information Program|year=1994|isbn=0-646-18791-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/aresweetdreamsma0000mcca}}\n* {{Cite book|last=McPhee|first=Colin|title=A House in Bali|publisher=Victor Gollancz Ltd.|year=2000|isbn=962-593-629-7}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Miller|first=George|title=To The Spice Islands And Beyond: Travels in Eastern Indonesia|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|isbn=967-65-3099-9}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Scidmore|first=E.R.|title=Java: The Garden of the East|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1986|isbn=0-19-582596-9}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Severin|first=Tim|title=The Spice Island Voyage: In Search of Wallace|publisher=Abacus|year=1997|isbn=0-349-11040-9}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Shavit|first=David|title=Bali and the tourist industry : a history, 1906\u20131942|publisher=Jefferson, N.C. : McFarland & Co.|year=2003|isbn=0-7864-1572-X}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Vickers|first=Adrian|title=Travelling to Bali: Four Hundred Years of Journeys|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|isbn=967-65-3081-6}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikivoyage|Indonesia}}\n* [http://www.indonesia.travel/en Indonesia's official tourism website]\n* [https://www.wonderfullindonesia.com Wonderful Indonesia online travel guide]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7AArQOS1gDZzaTGUQ2ZcQw Indonesia Travel] Wonderful Indonesia YouTube channel\n* [https://www.wisataidn.com/ Indonesian Tourism Journalist]\n\n{{Tourist attractions in Indonesia}}\n{{Indonesia topics}}\n{{Life in Indonesia}}\n{{Southeast Asia topic|Tourism in}}\n{{Tourism in Asia}}\n\n[[Category:Tourism in Indonesia| ]]\n", "name_user": "El C", "label": "safe", "comment": "{{pp-protected|small=yes}}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_Indonesia"}

Club Barcelona \"C\"''' was a [[List of football clubs in Spain|Spanish football team]] that folded on 2 July 2007. The [[youth team]] of [[FC Barcelona]], it played its home games at the [[Mini Estadi]].\n\nFounded in 1967 as ''Barcelona Amateur'', it adopted the name ''FC Barcelona C'' in 1993. Unlike the [[English football league system|English League]], youth teams in [[Spanish football league system|Spain]] play in the same football pyramid as their senior team rather than a separate league. However youth and [[reserve team]]s cannot play in the same division as their senior teams.\n\nFC Barcelona C last played in the [[Tercera Divisi\u00f3n|fourth division]]. They were ineligible for promotion to the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B|third level]], as [[FC Barcelona B]] were playing in that category. Club president [[Joan Laporta]] chose not inscribe the team in ''[[Primera Catalana]]'' for 2007\u201308, after the B team dropped to the fourth level.<ref>{{cite
