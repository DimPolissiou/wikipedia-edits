Minnie was the second of the couple's three children; her elder brother died as an infant.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nWhen Minnie was six years old, her mother died of unrecorded causes. After this, Minnie was sent to several different foster homes. Three years later, the courts permitted her to return home to her father, where she assumed many household chores and excelled in school. Her teacher, commending Vautrin's work at school, later said that \"Minnie was a born student...She could excel in most anything she tried, and was a genuinely Christian girl.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Hu, Hua-ling.

She enrolled in [[Columbia University]] in New York City to pursue a master's degree in education, which she received in 1919. While at Columbia University, Vautrin was approached by a teacher from [[Ginling College]], and was asked to serve as president of the institution for one year.<ref name=\"depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu\"/> The College was the third institution founded by a group of American missionaries who sought to \"establish four woman's colleges in China \u2013 one each in north, central, west, and south.\"<ref name=\"Feng, Jin 2009\">Feng, Jin.

She created courses on education administration and management, an innovative student-teaching program, and handled the planning and funding of the new campus by the West Gate of Nanking. During the fall semester of 1922, Vautrin hosted a fundraiser to build an elementary school for 150 local, mostly illiterate children who lived in the homes near Ginling College's campus. The biographer Hua-ling Hu writes that, while at Ginling College, Minnie \"attempted to lead the students to fulfill the spirit of Ginling's motto, 'abundant life,' by making them walk out of the 'ivory tower' to see and understand the suffering of the poor and by encouraging them to devote their lives for the betterment of the society.\"<ref name=\"Hua-Ling 2000\"/> However, some of the College's staff members and students did not support Vautrin's method, who found her overbearing, conservative, and self-righteous.<ref name=\"Feng, Jin 2009\"/> This may be due to her \"watchful and interfering administrative style.\"<ref name=\"Feng, Jin 2009\"/>\n\nIn 1926, after Vautrin returned from a brief visit to her family in America, the Nationalist government's Northern Expedition troops under General Chiang Kai-Shek captured Nanking.<ref name=\"Hua-Ling 2000\"/> While in Nanking, the army perpetrated the [[Nanking incident of 1927|Nanking Incident]], which involved the destruction and looting of the city and the slaughter of native citizens as well as foreigners. Ginling College was not harmed during the looting, and Vautrin hid in the College's attic with a few others while [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s troops were on Ginling's campus. The Nanking Incident deterred many American missionaries from serving in China, and many left the country.<ref name=\"Hua-Ling 2000\"/>\n\nHowever, Vautrin remained at Ginling College, and served as its president until the Chinese Nationalist government mandated that all colleges in China have native-born presidents. She was replaced by a Ginling graduate, Dr. Wu Yi-fang, in September 1928. In 1931, Vautrin returned to the United States on furlough and in order to care for her aging father. She returned to Ginling in 1932. On June 21, 1937, Vautrin received word that her father, Edmond, had died at the age of 83.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nUpon hearing of the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] in 1937, Vautrin cancelled her planned furlough, scheduled for 1938, and immediately returned to Nanking from Tokyo in order to protect Ginling College and its students.<ref name=\"depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu\"/> Vautrin prepared intensely for the approaching Japanese army. She made arrangements to prepare the campus by sending records to Shanghai, purchased supplies, instructed students and faculty on emergency precautions, cleaned out and converting rooms in campus buildings for storage and refuge, and ordered the building of trenches. The first Japanese air raid on Nanking took place on April 14, 1937. As a result of the raid, the American embassy arranged for the evacuation of Americans from the city. In her diary, Vautrin wrote that she felt compelled to stay in Nanking:\n\n<blockquote>I personally feel that I cannot leave... Men are not asked to leave their ships when they are in danger and women are not asked to leave their children.</blockquote>\n\nBy September, only three Ginling students remained on campus. Due to financial strains, the salaries of the fifteen remaining faculty members at Ginling College were halved. Anticipating a direct Japanese assault on the city, the foreigners who chose to stay in Nanking organized the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone (ICNSZ) on November 15, 1937. The committee requested that the Japanese and Chinese governments treat a refugee zone of Nanking as neutral, and both nations agreed and granted the ICNSZ neutrality. The Japanese placed one condition on the neutrality, requiring that the neutral zone would be made void if Chinese military personnel were found hiding within it.<ref name=\"depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu\"/>\n\nIn the first few nights of the Japanese attack on the city, 850 refugees came to Ginling College, which was designated as one of the twenty-five refugee camps in Nanking.<ref name=\"depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu\"/> When the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] [[Battle of Nanjing|took complete control of Nanking]] in December 1937, she and other foreign nationals, including [[John Rabe]], worked to protect civilians in the [[Nanking Safety Zone]]. Ginling College took up its full role as a refugee haven, at times harboring up to 10,000 women in buildings designed to support between 200 and 300.<ref name=\"depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu\"/> During this period, Vautrin wrote fairly frequently in her diary.<ref name=\"depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu\"/> One of her entries was a prayer:\n\n<blockquote>Oh, God, control the cruel beastliness of the soldiers in Nanking tonight, comfort the heartbroken mothers and fathers whose innocent sons have been shot today, and guard the young women and girls through the long agonizing hours of this night. Speed the day when wars shall be no more. When thy Kingdom will come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</blockquote>\n\nWhen all other refugee camps closed on February 4, 1938, a large number of women and children again sought refuge at the College and a census in mid-March showed 3,310 refugees were resident there.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Vautrin would patrol the campus grounds and repel incursions of Japanese soldiers into the College and rescue and care for refugees. She saw to the burial of the dead and the reception of newborn babies and was successful in tracing missing husbands and sons. Industrial or crafts classes were provided for women who had lost their husbands, so that they might support themselves.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Undaunted Women of Nanking: The Wartime Diaries of Minnie Vautrin and Tsen Shui-fang.|last=Vautrin|first=Minnie|last2=Shui-fang|first2=Tsen|last3=Hualing|first3=Hu|last4=Lian-hong|first4=Zhang|publisher=Carbondale: Southern Illinois|year=1937|isbn=|location=|pages=146}}</ref> One hundred women graduated under this program.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVautrin recounted the war in her diary in 1937:\n\n<blockquote>There probably is no crime that has not been committed in this city today.

How ashamed women of Japan would be if they knew these tales of horror.<ref name=\"Hua-Ling 2000\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn 1938, she wrote in her diary that she had to go to the Japanese embassy repeatedly from December 18 to January 13 to get proclamations to prohibit Japanese soldiers from committing crimes at Ginling because the soldiers tore the documents up before taking women away.<ref name=\"Hua-Ling 2000\"/>\nNear the end of her service at Ginling College, Vautrin wrote several entries that lacked her previous determination and optimism. Among these was April 14, 1940:\n\n<blockquote>I'm about at the end of my energy. Can no longer forge ahead and make plans for the work, for on every hand there seems to be obstacles of some kind.</blockquote>\n\nIn the spring of 1940, suffering from severe stress probably due to worry about the fate of Ginling College and its students,<ref name=\"depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu\"/> Vautrin was accompanied back to the United States by a colleague. After attempting to commit suicide using sleeping pills, Vautrin appeared to recover for a short while. However, she later committed suicide by turning on the [[Coal gas|stove gas]] in her apartment in [[Indianapolis]].

After this, Minnie was sent to several different foster homes. Three years later, the courts permitted her to return home to her father, where she assumed many household chores and excelled in school. Her teacher, commending Vautrin's work at school, later said that \"Minnie was a born student...She could excel in most anything she tried, and was a genuinely Christian girl.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Hu, Hua-ling.

She enrolled in [[Columbia University]] in New York City to pursue a master's degree in education, which she received in 1919. While at Columbia University, Vautrin was approached by a teacher from [[Ginling College]], and was asked to serve as president of the institution for one year.<ref name=\"depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu\"/> The College was the third institution founded by a group of American missionaries who sought to \"establish four woman's colleges in China \u2013 one each in north, central, west, and south.\"<ref name=\"Feng, Jin 2009\">Feng, Jin.

She created courses on education administration and management, an innovative student-teaching program, and handled the planning and funding of the new campus by the West Gate of Nanking. During the fall semester of 1922, Vautrin hosted a fundraiser to build an elementary school for 150 local, mostly illiterate children who lived in the homes near Ginling College's campus. The biographer Hua-ling Hu writes that, while at Ginling College, Minnie \"attempted to lead the students to fulfill the spirit of Ginling's motto, 'abundant life,' by making them walk out of the 'ivory tower' to see and understand the suffering of the poor and by encouraging them to devote their lives for the betterment of the society.\"<ref name=\"Hua-Ling 2000\"/> However, some of the College's staff members and students did not support Vautrin's method, who found her overbearing, conservative, and self-righteous.<ref name=\"Feng, Jin 2009\"/> This may be due to her \"watchful and interfering administrative style.\"<ref name=\"Feng, Jin 2009\"/>\n\nIn 1926, after Vautrin returned from a brief visit to her family in America, the Nationalist government's Northern Expedition troops under General Chiang Kai-Shek captured Nanking.<ref name=\"Hua-Ling 2000\"/> While in Nanking, the army perpetrated the [[Nanking incident of 1927|Nanking Incident]], which involved the destruction and looting of the city and the slaughter of native citizens as well as foreigners. Ginling College was not harmed during the looting, and Vautrin hid in the College's attic with a few others while [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s troops were on Ginling's campus. The Nanking Incident deterred many American missionaries from serving in China, and many left the country.<ref name=\"Hua-Ling 2000\"/>\n\nHowever, Vautrin remained at Ginling College, and served as its president until the Chinese Nationalist government mandated that all colleges in China have native-born presidents. She was replaced by a Ginling graduate, Dr. Wu Yi-fang, in September 1928. In 1931, Vautrin returned to the United States on furlough and in order to care for her aging father. She returned to Ginling in 1932. On June 21, 1937, Vautrin received word that her father, Edmond, had died at the age of 83.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nUpon hearing of the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] in 1937, Vautrin cancelled her planned furlough, scheduled for 1938, and immediately returned to Nanking from Tokyo in order to protect Ginling College and its students.<ref name=\"depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu\"/> Vautrin prepared intensely for the approaching Japanese army. She made arrangements to prepare the campus by sending records to Shanghai, purchased supplies, instructed students and faculty on emergency precautions, cleaned out and converting rooms in campus buildings for storage and refuge, and ordered the building of trenches. The first Japanese air raid on Nanking took place on April 14, 1937. As a result of the raid, the American embassy arranged for the evacuation of Americans from the city. In her diary, Vautrin wrote that she felt compelled to stay in Nanking:\n\n<blockquote>I personally feel that I cannot leave... Men are not asked to leave their ships when they are in danger and women are not asked to leave their children.</blockquote>\n\nBy September, only three Ginling students remained on campus. Due to financial strains, the salaries of the fifteen remaining faculty members at Ginling College were halved. Anticipating a direct Japanese assault on the city, the foreigners who chose to stay in Nanking organized the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone (ICNSZ) on November 15, 1937. The committee requested that the Japanese and Chinese governments treat a refugee zone of Nanking as neutral, and both nations agreed and granted the ICNSZ neutrality. The Japanese placed one condition on the neutrality, requiring that the neutral zone would be made void if Chinese military personnel were found hiding within it.<ref name=\"depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu\"/>\n\nIn the first few nights of the Japanese attack on the city, 850 refugees came to Ginling College, which was designated as one of the twenty-five refugee camps in Nanking.<ref name=\"depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu\"/> When the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] [[Battle of Nanjing|took complete control of Nanking]] in December 1937, she and other foreign nationals, including [[John Rabe]], worked to protect civilians in the [[Nanking Safety Zone]]. Ginling College took up its full role as a refugee haven, at times harboring up to 10,000 women in buildings designed to support between 200 and 300.<ref name=\"depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu\"/> During this period, Vautrin wrote fairly frequently in her diary.<ref name=\"depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu\"/> One of her entries was a prayer:\n\n<blockquote>Oh, God, control the cruel beastliness of the soldiers in Nanking tonight, comfort the heartbroken mothers and fathers whose innocent sons have been shot today, and guard the young women and girls through the long agonizing hours of this night. Speed the day when wars shall be no more. When thy Kingdom will come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</blockquote>\n\nWhen all other refugee camps closed on February 4, 1938, a large number of women and children again sought refuge at the College and a census in mid-March showed 3,310 refugees were resident there.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Vautrin would patrol the campus grounds and repel incursions of Japanese soldiers into the College and rescue and care for refugees. She saw to the burial of the dead and the reception of newborn babies and was successful in tracing missing husbands and sons. Industrial or crafts classes were provided for women who had lost their husbands, so that they might support themselves.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Undaunted Women of Nanking: The Wartime Diaries of Minnie Vautrin and Tsen Shui-fang.|last=Vautrin|first=Minnie|last2=Shui-fang|first2=Tsen|last3=Hualing|first3=Hu|last4=Lian-hong|first4=Zhang|publisher=Carbondale: Southern Illinois|year=1937|isbn=|location=|pages=146}}</ref> One hundred women graduated under this program.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVautrin recounted the war in her diary in 1937:\n\n<blockquote>There probably is no crime that has not been committed in this city today.

Among these was April 14, 1940:\n\n<blockquote>I'm about at the end of my energy. Can no longer forge ahead and make plans for the work, for on every hand there seems to be obstacles of some kind.</blockquote>\n\nIn the spring of 1940, suffering from severe stress probably due to worry about the fate of Ginling College and its students,<ref name=\"depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu\"/> Vautrin was accompanied back to the United States by a colleague.

The fragments can come from a reworking of [[Triassic]] basalt flows, with most of the products homogeneous, probably of trachyandesitic nature. The deposits are young, probably related to the magmatism of the [[Middle Jurassic]], with inflows probably contemporary with and related to eruptions, as in the case of many current volcanoes, in the form of dense flows. The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally. There is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]]. The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Montenat|first=Christian|last2=Monbaron|first2=Michel|last3=Allain|first3=Ronan|last4=Aquesbi|first4=Najat|last5=Dejax|first5=Jean|last6=Hernandez|first6=Jean|last7=Russell|first7=Dale|last8=Taquet|first8=Philippe|date=August 2005|title=Stratigraphie et pal\u00e9oenvironnement des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts volcano-d\u00e9tritiques \u00e0 dinosauriens du Jurassique inf\u00e9rieur de Toundoute (Province de Ouarzazate, Haut-Atlas \u2013 Maroc)|journal=Eclogae Geologicae Helvetiae|language=fr|volume=98|issue=2|pages=261\u2013270|doi=10.1007/s00015-005-1161-x|issn=0012-9402}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.

The predominantly terrigenous deposits of this formation suggest they were  deposited in continental setting, influenced by at least 6 different river channels, that trace it's path to the Atlas Gulf. On the [[Toarcian]]-[[Aalenian]] transgression, the High Atlas domain experienced a long process of extension and rifting, recorded by the presence of marine carbonates and shales, found on the Wazzant Formation Beds. It is related to the formation of the [[Atlantic Rifting]] to the west and of the formation of the [[Tethys]] to the north.<ref>El Harfi, A., Guiraud, M., & Lang, J. (2006).

The Toundoute sector recovers only the Middle to Late [[Toarcian]], with an atypical paleogeographic element, located on the route of the South Atlas Accident, with several changes on the structure leading to show the instability of the deposit area. The formation shows the transition from carbonates to a series of continental detrital sediments, with Palynomorphs and Fossils.

Journal of African Earth Sciences, 135, 54-71.</ref> The presence of volcanic sedimentation is one of the most important aspects on the Toundoute strata. The fragments can come from a reworking of [[Triassic]] basalt flows, with most of the products homogeneous, probably of trachyandesitic nature. The deposits are young, probably related to the magmatism of the [[Middle Jurassic]], with inflows probably contemporary with and related to eruptions, as in the case of many current volcanoes, in the form of dense flows. The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally. There is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]]. The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Montenat|first=Christian|last2=Monbaron|first2=Michel|last3=Allain|first3=Ronan|last4=Aquesbi|first4=Najat|last5=Dejax|first5=Jean|last6=Hernandez|first6=Jean|last7=Russell|first7=Dale|last8=Taquet|first8=Philippe|date=August 2005|title=Stratigraphie et pal\u00e9oenvironnement des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts volcano-d\u00e9tritiques \u00e0 dinosauriens du Jurassique inf\u00e9rieur de Toundoute (Province de Ouarzazate, Haut-Atlas \u2013 Maroc)|journal=Eclogae Geologicae Helvetiae|language=fr|volume=98|issue=2|pages=261\u2013270|doi=10.1007/s00015-005-1161-x|issn=0012-9402}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.

After he waited for three cement trucks to pass, a fourth truck, previously blocked by opposing traffic, struck him. He went under the first two wheels of the 42-ton truck and slid 500 feet. He was knocked unconscious, suffered [[acute shock]], and fell into a coma. He was rushed to [[intensive care]], where he woke up two weeks later. He had broken all the bones in both of his legs, had a [[collapsed lung]], developed multiple infections, and it was unknown whether he would ever walk again. Over several years, he had 26 surgeries and spent much of the time using a wheelchair. Due to the extent of his injuries, DeVine was at very high risk of having to have his legs amputated, and having [[multiple organ failure]]. It was later discovered that the reason he was not killed was because his bike took the full force of the truck.<ref name=\"ketv.com\"/>\n\nDeVine regained full mobility but still has extensive scarring on his legs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/adam-devine/bio/324819|title=Adam DeVine Biography|work=[[TV Guide]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115183122/http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/adam-devine/bio/324819|archivedate=January 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://ew.com/article/2016/07/08/adam-devine-origin-story-getting-hit-cement-truck/|title= Adam Devine's origin story: Getting hit by a cement truck|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Franich|first=Darren|date=July 8, 2016|access-date=March 4, 2020}}</ref> He said of the accident, \"It was really tough because I had to relearn how to walk, stand up, sit up and everything.

Upon returning to school, he experienced bullying, but told jokes as a way to deflect attention away from his injuries.
