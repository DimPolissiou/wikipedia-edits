It is bordered by [[Back Bay]], [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]], and [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]]. It is distinguished from other neighborhoods by its [[Victorian architecture|Victorian style]] houses and the many parks in and around the area.

In 1973, the South End was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> The construction of the South End began in 1849 when the neighborhood was built on tidal marshes.\n\nIt is home to many diverse groups, including immigrants, young families, and professionals, and it is very popular with the gay and lesbian community of Boston.<ref name=\"South End at a Glance\">{{cite web |title=At a Glance \u2013 South End |url=http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org/neighborhoods/south-end/at-a-glance |publisher=Boston Redevelopment Authority |accessdate=2015-05-09}}</ref> Since the 1880s the South End has been characterized by its diversity, with substantial Irish, Jewish, African-American, Puerto Rican (in the San Juan Street area), Chinese, and Greek populations. In 2010, the population was 55.2% white, 13.3% Hispanic, 12.5% Black or African American, 16.2% Asian, and 2.7% other; 55.2% of its residents had a bachelor's degree or higher; the median household income was $57,699; the median age was 36; 65.6% were primarily English speakers; and 12.9% were primarily Spanish speakers.<ref name=Demographics />\n\nThe South End has five primary and secondary schools that offer education from kindergarten to grade 12.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[File:2011 BostonMA 6367624621.jpg|thumbnail|right|Aerial view of the South End]]\n\n==Geographical history==\n[[File:BostonNeck.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The [[Boston Neck]] was the trajectory of today's Washington Street, which was formerly flanked by tidal marshes that were filled in over the years.]]\nThe South End lies south of the [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]], northwest of [[South Boston]], northeast of [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], north of [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]], and southwest of [[Bay Village, Boston|Bay Village]]. Despite the name, it is not directly south of the center of downtown Boston.\n\nThe land belonging to the South End has been part of the city of Boston since its creation, though at the time of first settlement it was much smaller and surrounded by large tidal flats.  The neighborhood was expanded and developed by filling in the marshlands, part of a larger project of the filling of Boston's Back Bay (north and west of Washington Street) and [[South Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|South Bay]] (south and east of Washington Street), from the 1830s to the 1870s. Fill was brought in by trains from large trenches of gravel excavated in [[Needham, Massachusetts]]. The South End was filled and developed before the neighborhood now known as Back Bay, which was mostly built after the [[American Civil War]]. Nineteenth-century technology did not allow for driving steel [[Deep foundation|piles]] into [[bedrock]], and instead a system of submerged timbers provided an understructure for most South End buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostongeology.com/boston/casestudies/southend/southend.htm|title=Creating Land in Boston's South End|website=Boston Rocks}}</ref> Recent{{when|date=August 2018}} decreases in underground water levels have caused damage to some wood pilings by exposing them to air. A series of [[monitoring well]]s have been drilled and the water level is now checked by the Boston Groundwater Trust,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostongroundwater.org/the-issue.html|title=The Issue|website=Boston Groundwater Trust}}</ref> and can be adjusted by the introduction of water.\n\nThe South End was once bordered to the north and west by the [[Boston and Providence Railroad]], which terminated at the B&P RR Station bordering the Public Garden. The railroad line is now covered by the Southwest Corridor Park and terminates at [[Back Bay Station]]. Most of the cross streets in the neighborhood are named after cities and towns served by it or by the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]]:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]], [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland]], [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Camden, Maine]], [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], [[Sharon, Massachusetts|Sharon]], [[Randolph, Massachusetts|Randolph]], [[Plympton, Massachusetts|Plympton]], [[Stoughton, Massachusetts|Stoughton]], [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], [[Dover, Massachusetts|Dover]], [[Chatham, Massachusetts|Chatham]], and [[Wareham, Massachusetts|Wareham]].\n\nThe primary business thoroughfares of the South End are [[Columbus Avenue (Boston)|Columbus Avenue]], [[Tremont Street]], and [[Washington Street (Boston)|Washington Street]], all between West Newton Street and Berkeley Street. Washington Street, the original causeway that connected Roxbury to Boston, experienced considerable reinvestment in the 1990s. The street was once defined by the [[Washington Street Elevated]], an elevated train that was moved to below Southwest Corridor Park in the 1980s. Currently, two branches of the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]], Boston's first [[bus rapid transit]] line, run along Washington Street. Columbus Avenue, the third main street of the South End, also has numerous restaurants and provides a remarkable straight-line view to the steeple of [[Park Street Church]]. Today the modern [[MBTA]] [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] rapid transit train runs along the partially covered [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]], with neighborhood stops at [[Back Bay (MBTA station)|Back Bay]] (also an [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] stop due to its proximity to the [[Copley Square]] employment center) and [[Massachusetts Avenue (MBTA Orange Line station)|Massachusetts Avenue]].\n\n===Subdistricts===\n\nThe [[Boston Redevelopment Authority]] identifies several subdistricts covering the southeast portion of the neighborhood:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/south_end/2012/09/hotel_residential_towers_okd_f.html|title=Hotel, residential towers OK'd for South End's New York Streets area|last1=Kaiser|first1=Johanna|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=September 17, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[SoWa|SOWA]] (South of Washington Area), roughly between Albany to Washington and East Berkeley to Mass Ave.\n* New York Streets, between Herald, East Berkeley, Albany, and Tremont Streets\n* Back Streets, roughly between I-93, Harrison, East Brookline, and East Berkeley Streets\n* Medical area, roughly between the highway, [[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]], Franklin Square, and East Brookline Street\n\n==Parks==\nA series of eleven residential parks are located across the South End, most are elliptical in shape with passive-use green space located in the middle. These residential squares vary in size, and take inspiration from English-inspired residential squares first laid out by Charles Bulfinch downtown. Many of the parks have a central fountain and are bordered with cast iron fencing. Complementing the nineteenth century residential parks are several newer parks including [[Peters Park (Boston)|Peters Park]], and a series of sixteen community gardens and pocket parks operated by the [[South End Lower Roxbury Open Space Land Trust]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Alexandra Hotel, Boston, MA, 1899.jpg|thumb|left|Alexandra Hotel in 1899]]\n\n===Residential history===\n\nAs the South End geographically grew from filling in land north and west of \"the Neck\" (today's Washington Street) the city of Boston envisioned a large inner city residential neighborhood to relieve the crowded downtown and Beacon Hill neighborhoods. The city also hoped for a large and stable tax base. Architect [[Charles Bulfinch]] laid out some of the first filled land. He designed a large residential park called Columbia Square located at the present [[Franklin and Blackstone Squares]]. Bulfinch's plan was to route traffic around the square, not through it. Eventually his plan was abandoned and Washington street was allowed to once more divide the square creating today's separate squares.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nMany rooming houses on the Back Bay side of the South End had no bathing facilities; roomers went to public showers to bathe. Filled land in the South End was originally eight feet above sea level, but is now four feet, as fill settles. The original shore line of Boston Neck crosses in front of 40 St. George Street, (formerly 11 James Street), and tapers to the narrowest point on the Neck at Dover Street. Blackstone and Franklin Square are solid land on the original neck, but clam and snail shells are just beneath its surface, as high seas would occasionally overrun the Neck. Massive granite blocks of original sea wall can be seen on the Harrison Avenue side of the Joshua Bates School.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nA burgeoning middle class moved to the South End including business owners, two mayors, bankers, and industrialists. Though the neighborhood's status as a wealthy neighborhood was relatively short-lived, myths of a dramatic [[white flight]] in the 1880s are not entirely true. A series of national [[financial panic]]s (see e.g., [[Panic of 1884]], [[Economic history of the United States]]), combined with the emergence of new residential housing in Back Bay and [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]] fed a steady decline of whites of [[English Protestant]] ancestry. Whites remained in the neighborhood, but increasingly they were [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Catholic]] and recent immigrants.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nBy the close of the nineteenth century the South End was becoming a [[tenement]] district, first attracting new immigrants and, in the 1940s, single [[gay]] men. The South End also became a center of [[Black people|black]] middle class Boston life and culture. The largest concentration of [[Pullman Porter]]s in the country lived in the South End, mostly between Columbus Avenue and the railroad bed. As the decades progressed, more buildings became [[tenement]]s and by the 1960s absentee landlordism was rampant and the neighborhood was one of the poorest of the city.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nThe first [[settlement house]]s in Boston were in the South End: the South End House, Haley House, Lincoln House, the Harriet Tubman House, and the Children's Art Centre. In 1960 these settlement houses merged to form [[United South End Settlements]].<ref>[http://www.library.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m126find.htm Finding aid for the United South End Settlements Records<!-- Bot generated title -->], Northeastern University Libraries, Boston, MA</ref>\n\n===Urban renewal===\n[[Image:UnionPark Shawmut.jpg|thumb|220px|Union Park Street and Shawmut Avenue]]\n[[File:2010 ColumbusAve Boston.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Columbus Avenue (Boston)|Columbus Avenue]] in the South End]]\nThe South End was one of many large-scale landfill projects in Boston to create new residential districts.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> Construction started in 1849, it was built on tidal marshes that surrounded Boston Neck.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> The street plan for the South End was to pattern the 18th-century English models, it would have blocks of townhouses overlook small parks in the centers of the residential streets.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> The parks were built to make the South End more beautiful and make it feel like a community.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> These townhouses quickly became the predominant form of housing, builders produced blocks of houses for the middle-class families.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> From 1850 to 1880, these townhouses started to get built, with the typical townhouse having a mix of architectural styles.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> The South End also became a popular hospital district with the first being the [[Boston City Hospital]] which attracted other hospitals to the area.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> One of the hospitals that came into the South End was the [[Massachusetts Homeopathic Hospital]] that was built in 1875.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> It used fresh air cures and home remedies to heal their patients but if one of the patients needed surgery they were sent to the [[Boston University School of Medicine]].<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> The Boston University School of Medicine first came into the South End in 1874 accompanied by the New England Female College, which was the first college in the region that accepted women.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> By the late 19th century the South End was becoming increasingly populated by African Americans who were coming from the South.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> Even though City Hospital admitted black patients, they didn't allow them into their training programs or hire black professionals.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> By 1908 a black physician from Alabama named Dr. Cornelius Garland opened his own hospital called Plymouth Hospital and the Nurse's Training School.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> By 1929, Plymouth Hospital closed down because City Hospital started to accept people of color into their medical and nursing programs.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" />\n\nThe connection of Boston and [[Albany, New York]] by railroad (by some of the various companies that would later merge into the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]]) was celebrated in 1841 as a way to keep Boston competitive with New York City as an Atlantic port.  Just south of the Boston and Worcester Railroad (where the Massachusetts Turnpike is now) in the next decade arose the New York Streets district, a residential area of the South End where the streets were named after cities on the route to Albany.  Albany Street still exists (though it now ends at the Turnpike rather than Kneeland); connecting Albany Street with Harrison Street from north to south were Seneca, Oneida, Oswego, Genesee, Rochester and Troy Streets (Troy became the modern Traveler Street).<ref name=\"Marstall\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/08/18/boston-vanished-new-york-streets/EVxSqBnv9ups9yO5Q6MhTP/story.html|date=2012-08-19|title=Boston's vanished New York Streets|agency=Boston Globe|first=Christopher|last=Marstall}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L7GdFKiJvs0/TZFC9TN0M-I/AAAAAAAAC9g/48Uxsc-XaQ4/s1600/new%2Byork%2Bsts%2B1938.jpg|title=Detailed 1938 map|website=bp.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bostonhistory.typepad.com/notes_on_the_urban_condit/2006/03/new_york_street_1.html|title=New York Streets, Part Two|accessdate=2012-10-01|date=2006-03-23}} \u2013 detailed street history</ref>\n\nStarting in 1955, nearly all of the buildings in the New York Streets district were bulldozed as part of an [[urban renewal]] project to clear \"slums\" and make room for industrial activity in a period marked by urban decline.

Since it is located where there was access to railroads and port facilities it attracted a lot of manufacturers.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> Albany Street, which is along the Roxbury Canal, became occupied by warehouses and factories.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> By the 19th century, it became the center of Boston's furniture and piano-making industry.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> Today, the South End has many new developments that will add not only residential space, but also commercial space. According to the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) there is a new project being constructed that will be built on Albany Street. According to the Expanded Project Notification Form this new development will \"include two hotels: a 16-story select service hotel, which will have a restaurant on its first floor; and a 9-story extended-stay hotel. The hotels together will have approximately 408 rooms. While the split between the two types of hotels has not been finally determined, current plans anticipate approximately 210 rooms in the select service hotel and approximately 198 rooms in the extended-stay hotel. The select-service hotel will include an approximately 4,000 square-foot (approximately 267-seat) restaurant on its first floor.

Wally's is the only venue to have survived to the present day.\n\nFrom 1915 to 1970 the [[American Federation of Musicians]] Local 535 was the top black musicians' union in the country, with local and national musicians such as [[Duke Ellington]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Chick Webb]], [[Earl Hines]], and [[Jimmie Lunceford]]. Its offices were originally above [[Charlie's Sandwich Shoppe]] (whose walls are lined with photographs of the jazz stars who ate there), but moved to 409 Massachusetts Avenue around 1930. In 1970 it and the white union (Local 9) were ordered to merge by the courts (Boston Musicians Association Local 9-535) and most of the black musicians left.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nejazz.org/Community/JazzNotes/moonoogian1985.php|title=New England Jazz Alliance - New England Jazz Notes<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=nejazz.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822175951/http://www.nejazz.org/Community/JazzNotes/moonoogian1985.php|archivedate=2007-08-22}}</ref>\n\n====Education====\n[[File:Boston University Medical Center 01.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Boston University Medical Campus]]]]\nThe South End has 5 primary and secondary schools, providing education from Kindergarten through grade 12.

The Animal Rescue League of Boston features an animal shelter, an animal cruelty investigation and prosecution law enforcement department, a rescue department, an animal behavior department and an outpatient veterinary facility, Boston Veterinary Care.\n\n===Diversity===\n\n[[Image:CCHolyCross.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Holy Cross Cathedral]]\nThe South End's population has been diverse since the 1880s when [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Demographics of Lebanon|Lebanese]],  [[Jew]]ish, [[African-American]], and [[Greeks|Greek]] populations began to settle in the neighborhood. In the 1930s a substantial immigration from [[Canada]]'s [[maritime provinces]] found economic opportunity in Boston, and homes in the South End neighborhood.\n\nBeginning in the 1940s, particularly after the end of WWII the South End's rooming houses became home to growing numbers of gays and lesbians. The environment of single sex rooming houses provided homes and social cover for unmarried GLBT people. In the late 1940s a growing population of Hispanic people began settlement. At first much of this settlement was centered around the [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross (Boston)|Cathedral of the Holy Cross]].\n\nToday the neighborhood remains diverse, integrating people of nearly every race, religion, and sexual orientation.\n\nIncome levels are anecdotally reported as stratified: a concentration of the wealthy and the poor. However, neither the U.S. Census or City of Boston reports on income of this specific neighborhood. Though [[gentrification]] is sometimes cited as a reason for flight of poorer and non-white residents, the neighborhood has maintained racial and income diversity due to a large number of subsidized, publicly owned, or otherwise low-income housing units and a homeless shelter. Subsidized below market rate housing developments such as Methunion Manor, Cathedral Housing ([[public housing]] project), Villa Victoria, Tent City, Lenox St Apartments, Camden, Camfield Gardens, 1850 Washington St, and Mandela Homes vary considerably and represent evolving attitudes in public housing design and governance.\n\nAlthough all neighborhoods in Boston suffer from crime, the city has a comparatively low incidence of [[street crime]]. The South End is large enough that some parts can be known for street crime while others are [[family friendly]].  Those parts include the Villa Victoria Affordable Housing, the Cathedral Housing Projects, and some areas west of Mass. Ave. The South End has more public [[playgrounds]] per square foot than other Boston neighborhoods. The South End is known as an increasingly [[upper middle class]] neighborhood, although is still home to many lower income residents. Some long-time residents are being pushed out by rising rents and property taxes. Because of a strong low-income agenda from the city, its recent (until the 1970s) history of impoverishment, and the presence of several low income housing projects, the South End will likely remain economically and racially diverse.\n\nThe South End used to be known as a [[gay]], artistic, and cultural neighborhood, although rising costs in the neighborhood threaten this character.

Despite the name, it is not directly south of the center of downtown Boston.\n\nThe land belonging to the South End has been part of the city of Boston since its creation, though at the time of first settlement it was much smaller and surrounded by large tidal flats.  The neighborhood was expanded and developed by filling in the marshlands, part of a larger project of the filling of Boston's Back Bay (north and west of Washington Street) and [[South Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|South Bay]] (south and east of Washington Street), from the 1830s to the 1870s. Fill was brought in by trains from large trenches of gravel excavated in [[Needham, Massachusetts]]. The South End was filled and developed before the neighborhood now known as Back Bay, which was mostly built after the [[American Civil War]]. Nineteenth-century technology did not allow for driving steel [[Deep foundation|piles]] into [[bedrock]], and instead a system of submerged timbers provided an understructure for most South End buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostongeology.com/boston/casestudies/southend/southend.htm|title=Creating Land in Boston's South End|website=Boston Rocks}}</ref> Recent{{when|date=August 2018}} decreases in underground water levels have caused damage to some wood pilings by exposing them to air.

The railroad line is now covered by the Southwest Corridor Park and terminates at [[Back Bay Station]]. Most of the cross streets in the neighborhood are named after cities and towns served by it or by the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]]:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]], [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland]], [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Camden, Maine]], [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], [[Sharon, Massachusetts|Sharon]], [[Randolph, Massachusetts|Randolph]], [[Plympton, Massachusetts|Plympton]], [[Stoughton, Massachusetts|Stoughton]], [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], [[Dover, Massachusetts|Dover]], [[Chatham, Massachusetts|Chatham]], and [[Wareham, Massachusetts|Wareham]].\n\nThe primary business thoroughfares of the South End are [[Columbus Avenue (Boston)|Columbus Avenue]], [[Tremont Street]], and [[Washington Street (Boston)|Washington Street]], all between West Newton Street and Berkeley Street. Washington Street, the original causeway that connected Roxbury to Boston, experienced considerable reinvestment in the 1990s. The street was once defined by the [[Washington Street Elevated]], an elevated train that was moved to below Southwest Corridor Park in the 1980s. Currently, two branches of the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]], Boston's first [[bus rapid transit]] line, run along Washington Street. Columbus Avenue, the third main street of the South End, also has numerous restaurants and provides a remarkable straight-line view to the steeple of [[Park Street Church]]. Today the modern [[MBTA]] [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] rapid transit train runs along the partially covered [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]], with neighborhood stops at [[Back Bay (MBTA station)|Back Bay]] (also an [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] stop due to its proximity to the [[Copley Square]] employment center) and [[Massachusetts Avenue (MBTA Orange Line station)|Massachusetts Avenue]].\n\n===Subdistricts===\n\nThe [[Boston Redevelopment Authority]] identifies several subdistricts covering the southeast portion of the neighborhood:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/south_end/2012/09/hotel_residential_towers_okd_f.html|title=Hotel, residential towers OK'd for South End's New York Streets area|last1=Kaiser|first1=Johanna|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=September 17, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[SoWa|SOWA]] (South of Washington Area), roughly between Albany to Washington and East Berkeley to Mass Ave.\n* New York Streets, between Herald, East Berkeley, Albany, and Tremont Streets\n* Back Streets, roughly between I-93, Harrison, East Brookline, and East Berkeley Streets\n* Medical area, roughly between the highway, [[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]], Franklin Square, and East Brookline Street\n\n==Parks==\nA series of eleven residential parks are located across the South End, most are elliptical in shape with passive-use green space located in the middle. These residential squares vary in size, and take inspiration from English-inspired residential squares first laid out by Charles Bulfinch downtown. Many of the parks have a central fountain and are bordered with cast iron fencing. Complementing the nineteenth century residential parks are several newer parks including [[Peters Park (Boston)|Peters Park]], and a series of sixteen community gardens and pocket parks operated by the [[South End Lower Roxbury Open Space Land Trust]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Alexandra Hotel, Boston, MA, 1899.jpg|thumb|left|Alexandra Hotel in 1899]]\n\n===Residential history===\n\nAs the South End geographically grew from filling in land north and west of \"the Neck\" (today's Washington Street) the city of Boston envisioned a large inner city residential neighborhood to relieve the crowded downtown and Beacon Hill neighborhoods. The city also hoped for a large and stable tax base. Architect [[Charles Bulfinch]] laid out some of the first filled land. He designed a large residential park called Columbia Square located at the present [[Franklin and Blackstone Squares]]. Bulfinch's plan was to route traffic around the square, not through it. Eventually his plan was abandoned and Washington street was allowed to once more divide the square creating today's separate squares.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nMany rooming houses on the Back Bay side of the South End had no bathing facilities; roomers went to public showers to bathe. Filled land in the South End was originally eight feet above sea level, but is now four feet, as fill settles. The original shore line of Boston Neck crosses in front of 40 St. George Street, (formerly 11 James Street), and tapers to the narrowest point on the Neck at Dover Street. Blackstone and Franklin Square are solid land on the original neck, but clam and snail shells are just beneath its surface, as high seas would occasionally overrun the Neck. Massive granite blocks of original sea wall can be seen on the Harrison Avenue side of the Joshua Bates School.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nA burgeoning middle class moved to the South End including business owners, two mayors, bankers, and industrialists. Though the neighborhood's status as a wealthy neighborhood was relatively short-lived, myths of a dramatic [[white flight]] in the 1880s are not entirely true. A series of national [[financial panic]]s (see e.g., [[Panic of 1884]], [[Economic history of the United States]]), combined with the emergence of new residential housing in Back Bay and [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]] fed a steady decline of whites of [[English Protestant]] ancestry. Whites remained in the neighborhood, but increasingly they were [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Catholic]] and recent immigrants.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nBy the close of the nineteenth century the South End was becoming a [[tenement]] district, first attracting new immigrants and, in the 1940s, single [[gay]] men. The South End also became a center of [[Black people|black]] middle class Boston life and culture. The largest concentration of [[Pullman Porter]]s in the country lived in the South End, mostly between Columbus Avenue and the railroad bed. As the decades progressed, more buildings became [[tenement]]s and by the 1960s absentee landlordism was rampant and the neighborhood was one of the poorest of the city.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nThe first [[settlement house]]s in Boston were in the South End: the South End House, Haley House, Lincoln House, the Harriet Tubman House, and the Children's Art Centre.

Just south of the Boston and Worcester Railroad (where the Massachusetts Turnpike is now) in the next decade arose the New York Streets district, a residential area of the South End where the streets were named after cities on the route to Albany.  Albany Street still exists (though it now ends at the Turnpike rather than Kneeland); connecting Albany Street with Harrison Street from north to south were Seneca, Oneida, Oswego, Genesee, Rochester and Troy Streets (Troy became the modern Traveler Street).<ref name=\"Marstall\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/08/18/boston-vanished-new-york-streets/EVxSqBnv9ups9yO5Q6MhTP/story.html|date=2012-08-19|title=Boston's vanished New York Streets|agency=Boston Globe|first=Christopher|last=Marstall}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L7GdFKiJvs0/TZFC9TN0M-I/AAAAAAAAC9g/48Uxsc-XaQ4/s1600/new%2Byork%2Bsts%2B1938.jpg|title=Detailed 1938 map|website=bp.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bostonhistory.typepad.com/notes_on_the_urban_condit/2006/03/new_york_street_1.html|title=New York Streets, Part Two|accessdate=2012-10-01|date=2006-03-23}} \u2013 detailed street history</ref>\n\nStarting in 1955, nearly all of the buildings in the New York Streets district were bulldozed as part of an [[urban renewal]] project to clear \"slums\" and make room for industrial activity in a period marked by urban decline.

Since it is located where there was access to railroads and port facilities it attracted a lot of manufacturers.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> Albany Street, which is along the Roxbury Canal, became occupied by warehouses and factories.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> By the 19th century, it became the center of Boston's furniture and piano-making industry.<ref name=\"St. Botolph\" /> Today, the South End has many new developments that will add not only residential space, but also commercial space. According to the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) there is a new project being constructed that will be built on Albany Street. According to the Expanded Project Notification Form this new development will \"include two hotels: a 16-story select service hotel, which will have a restaurant on its first floor; and a 9-story extended-stay hotel. The hotels together will have approximately 408 rooms. While the split between the two types of hotels has not been finally determined, current plans anticipate approximately 210 rooms in the select service hotel and approximately 198 rooms in the extended-stay hotel. The select-service hotel will include an approximately 4,000 square-foot (approximately 267-seat) restaurant on its first floor.

Wally's is the only venue to have survived to the present day.\n\nFrom 1915 to 1970 the [[American Federation of Musicians]] Local 535 was the top black musicians' union in the country, with local and national musicians such as [[Duke Ellington]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Chick Webb]], [[Earl Hines]], and [[Jimmie Lunceford]]. Its offices were originally above [[Charlie's Sandwich Shoppe]] (whose walls are lined with photographs of the jazz stars who ate there), but moved to 409 Massachusetts Avenue around 1930. In 1970 it and the white union (Local 9) were ordered to merge by the courts (Boston Musicians Association Local 9-535) and most of the black musicians left.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nejazz.org/Community/JazzNotes/moonoogian1985.php|title=New England Jazz Alliance - New England Jazz Notes<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=nejazz.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822175951/http://www.nejazz.org/Community/JazzNotes/moonoogian1985.php|archivedate=2007-08-22}}</ref>\n\n====Education====\n[[File:Boston University Medical Center 01.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Boston University Medical Campus]]]]\nThe South End has 5 primary and secondary schools, providing education from Kindergarten through grade 12.

It is also home to Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology; established in 1908, BFIT is one of New England's oldest colleges of technology, started with a bequest from Benjamin Franklin and a gift from Andrew Carnegie.\n\n==Community resources==\nThe South End is conveniently located within the radius of three public libraries. The closest to this neighborhood is the South End Branch of the [[Boston Public Library]].<ref name=\"The South End Branch\">{{cite web|title=The South End Branch|url=http://www.bpl.org/branches/southend.htm|website=Boston Public Library|accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref> It has different hours of operation,{{clarify|reason=Different from what?|date=December 2015}} so plan accordingly if interested in visiting this location.

The Animal Rescue League of Boston features an animal shelter, an animal cruelty investigation and prosecution law enforcement department, a rescue department, an animal behavior department and an outpatient veterinary facility, Boston Veterinary Care.\n\n===Diversity===\n\n[[Image:CCHolyCross.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Holy Cross Cathedral]]\nThe South End's population has been diverse since the 1880s when [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Demographics of Lebanon|Lebanese]],  [[Jew]]ish, [[African-American]], and [[Greeks|Greek]] populations began to settle in the neighborhood. In the 1930s a substantial immigration from [[Canada]]'s [[maritime provinces]] found economic opportunity in Boston, and homes in the South End neighborhood.\n\nBeginning in the 1940s, particularly after the end of WWII the South End's rooming houses became home to growing numbers of gays and lesbians. The environment of single sex rooming houses provided homes and social cover for unmarried GLBT people. In the late 1940s a growing population of Hispanic people began settlement. At first much of this settlement was centered around the [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross (Boston)|Cathedral of the Holy Cross]].\n\nToday the neighborhood remains diverse, integrating people of nearly every race, religion, and sexual orientation.\n\nIncome levels are anecdotally reported as stratified: a concentration of the wealthy and the poor. However, neither the U.S. Census or City of Boston reports on income of this specific neighborhood. Though [[gentrification]] is sometimes cited as a reason for flight of poorer and non-white residents, the neighborhood has maintained racial and income diversity due to a large number of subsidized, publicly owned, or otherwise low-income housing units and a homeless shelter. Subsidized below market rate housing developments such as Methunion Manor, Cathedral Housing ([[public housing]] project), Villa Victoria, Tent City, Lenox St Apartments, Camden, Camfield Gardens, 1850 Washington St, and Mandela Homes vary considerably and represent evolving attitudes in public housing design and governance.\n\nAlthough all neighborhoods in Boston suffer from crime, the city has a comparatively low incidence of [[street crime]]. The South End is large enough that some parts can be known for street crime while others are [[family friendly]].  Those parts include the Villa Victoria Affordable Housing, the Cathedral Housing Projects, and some areas west of Mass. Ave. The South End has more public [[playgrounds]] per square foot than other Boston neighborhoods. The South End is known as an increasingly [[upper middle class]] neighborhood, although is still home to many lower income residents. Some long-time residents are being pushed out by rising rents and property taxes. Because of a strong low-income agenda from the city, its recent (until the 1970s) history of impoverishment, and the presence of several low income housing projects, the South End will likely remain economically and racially diverse.\n\nThe South End used to be known as a [[gay]], artistic, and cultural neighborhood, although rising costs in the neighborhood threaten this character. Unlike in cities such as [[New York City]], there are no city policies to help artists keep their long-term studios. Art galleries, however, are flourishing even though there are not many. GardenMoms, now one of Boston's most popular online parent groups with over 2500 members citywide, was started by several South End moms in 2002, and helped confirm the role of families as a growing and important facet of this community.  (It is named after the South End cafe it started in, The Garden of Eden.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gardenmoms.findsmithgroups.com/|title=Findsmith Groups|website=gardenmoms.findsmithgroups.com}}</ref>\n\nThough housing in the South End is very expensive by U.S. and [[Greater Boston]] standards\u2014it is rare to find a one bedroom condo for less than $400,000\u2014the South End remains less expensive than the wealthiest central Boston neighborhoods (Beacon Hill and the Back Bay).\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the 2010 Census, the total population of the South End is approximately 24,577, which is a 12.2% increase from 2000.<ref name=Demographics>{{cite web|title=Boston In Context: Neighborhood|url=http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org/getattachment/e50e791c-caa4-41b0-9d14-35f88cff77af|website=Boston Redevelopment Authority|accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref> The South End is made up of 55.2% White, 13.3% Hispanic/Latino, 12.5% Black or African American, 16.2% Asian, and 2.7% Other.<ref name=Demographics /> Within the South End 33.8% of the population is between the ages of 20 through 34 years old, 8% are under 9 years old.<ref name=Demographics /> 5.9% of South End residents are 10\u201319 years old, 31.2% are 35-54, 10.5% are 55-64, and 10.6% are 65 and older.<ref name=Demographics /> The median age for the South End is 36 years old.<ref name=Demographics /> About 55.2% of the population holds a college degree in the South End, with 29.2% having a bachelor's degree and 26% holding a graduate degree.<ref name=Demographics /> The primary language that is spoken in this neighborhood is English with it being at 65.6%, followed by Spanish at 12.9%, Chinese 10.4%, French 2.7%, Portuguese 1%, and other languages 7.4%.<ref name=Demographics /> The median income of the South End is $57,699, with 10.9% of the population making between $50,000 and $74,000 each year.<ref name=Demographics /> There are 12,831 households in the South End, with 23.3% of the residents living in a family that includes a wife and a husband, and 47.4% are living alone without a family.<ref name=Demographics /> As of 2010, 45.2% of the residents are without vehicles but on the other hand 45.2% do own vehicle.<ref name=Demographics /> Approximately, 34% of the South Ends uses public transportation which doesn't include using a taxi.<ref name=Demographics /> The South End has about 58.1% of its population working in the Management, Business, Science, and Arts field with 79.1% of the labor force being between the ages of 20 to 34 years old.<ref name=Demographics /> The 2010 Census states that 72.6% of the South End population has lived in the same place for the past year while 12.8% have moved to a different location but the same county, 7.5% moved from a different county to the South End, and 5.9% moved from a different state to this location.<ref name=Demographics />\n\n[[File:South End Boston - panoramio.jpg|thumbnail|right|South End, Boston]]\n\n==Public transportation==\nWhile no Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ([[MBTA]]) trains run directly through the South End, the neighborhood is close to subway stops, including [[Copley (MBTA station)|Copley]], [[Symphony station|Symphony]], and [[Prudential (MBTA station)|Prudential]] stations on the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] and [[Ruggles_station|Ruggles]], [[Massachusetts Avenue station|Massachusetts Avenue]], and [[Back Bay station|Back Bay]] stations on the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]].<ref name=Entertainment>{{cite web|last1=BU Today staff|title=Getting to Know Your Neighborhood: The South End|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2015/getting-to-know-your-neighborhood-the-south-end/|website=BU Today|accessdate=15 April 2015}}</ref> [[Commuter rail]] service on the [[Franklin Line|Franklin]], [[Needham Line|Needham]], and [[Providence/Stoughton Line|Providence/Stoughton]] lines is available at Ruggles and Back Bay stations.

In the eastern part of the reef there are some sandy cays, {{convert|1|to|3|m|0|abbr=on}} in height covered with grass and small bushes. The entrance into the central lagoon is possible from a south-southeastern direction. There is an abundance of [[sea bird]]s, and the [[cay]]s are covered in tons of [[guano]].\n\nAbout {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest of Geysir is [[Z\u00e9l\u00e9e Bank]], a deep submarine feature.\n\n==History==\nThe Geysir Reef was first known by [[Arab]] sailors around the year 700, and was shown on some navigation-charts dated around 800. Around 1650 the reef was shown on Spanish maps as ''Arecife de Santo Antonio''.

The rocks are generally {{convert|1.5|to|3|m|1|abbr=on}} in height; the largest is South Rock, with a height of {{convert|8|m|0|abbr=on}}, similar to a boat under sail. In the eastern part of the reef there are some sandy cays, {{convert|1|to|3|m|0|abbr=on}} in height covered with grass and small bushes. The entrance into the central lagoon is possible from a south-southeastern direction. There is an abundance of [[sea bird]]s, and the [[cay]]s are covered in tons of [[guano]].\n\nAbout {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest of Geysir is [[Z\u00e9l\u00e9e Bank]], a deep submarine feature.\n\n==History==\nThe Geysir Reef was first known by [[Arab]] sailors around the year 700, and was shown on some navigation-charts dated around 800. Around 1650 the reef was shown on Spanish maps as ''Arecife de Santo Antonio''. The current name was given on 23 December 1678, when the British vessel [[Geysir (ship)|Geysir]] ran on the reef.\n\nFrance and the [[Comoros]] claim the Banc du Geyser as part of their [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ).
