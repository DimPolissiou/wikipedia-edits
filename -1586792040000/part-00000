After two months, Local 15 members voted on August 31 to return to their jobs. The union made an unconditional offer to return to work while still negotiating an agreement.\n\"Some of the guys were hurting financially, that's why we voted to go back to work,\" said Tom O'Reilly, Ass't Business Manager for Local 15. \"We have no intention of agreeing with the company's current proposal.\" Midwest rejected that offer and locked out all of its workers who honored the picket line at the time IBEW Local 15 made the offer to return. Faced with a lockout, the union accepted Midwest Generation's contract offer and the locked-out employees returned to work nearly seven weeks later under the terms of a new agreement which was less favorable to employees.\n\nImmediately after the company instituted the lockout, IBEW Local 15 filed an unfair labor practice charge with Region 13 claiming that the lockout was unlawful. The case was submitted to the NLRB's Division of Advice and in March 2002, the Regional Director for Region 13 issued a complaint against Midwest Generation. The complaint alleged that the lockout unlawfully targeted employees based on their union activity because the company permitted employees to continue to work during the lockout if they had not struck, or if they had ceased to participate in the strike prior to the union's unconditional offer to return.\n\nThe case was transferred to the NLRB in May 2002 and in September 2004, by a 2\u20131 panel vote, the George Bush-appointed Board[9] found that Midwest Generation had not violated the NLRA. In October 2005, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the Board's decision and remanded the case back to the Board with instructions to find that the lockout violated Section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act because it unlawfully targeted employees based on their union activity. With respect to the remedy, the Seventh Circuit directed the Board to consider whether the lockout coerced the employees into accepting the contract offer, thereby voiding the agreement. In 2006, the Supreme Court declined to hear Midwest Generation's appeal.\n\nIn March 2008, the Board accepted the Seventh Circuit's remand and ordered that the employees who were locked out be made whole for the period of the lockout. In addition, the Board remanded the case to an administrative law judge to consider voiding the contract. In the meantime, Midwest Generation and IBEW Local 15 had successfully negotiated a successor collective bargaining agreement that replaced the contract from the 2001 negotiations.\n\nChief Judge Giannasi oversaw extensive settlement talks that resulted in a global settlement of all issues related to the lockout, including the potential contract voiding issue. The parties worked cooperatively to calculate the losses that employees suffered as a direct result of the lockout. In November 2008, the parties agreed upon approximately $16 million in backpay and other damages, including 401(k)and other reimbursable losses.\n\nDemolition of the plant began in 2019.<ref name=\"Pe\u00f1a22719\"/><ref name=\"Pe\u00f1a123119\"/> On December 30, 2019, a worker fell to his death, and demolition was halted.<ref name=\"Pe\u00f1a123119\"/><ref>Pe\u00f1a, Mauricio. \"[https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/01/06/demolition-of-crawford-coal-plant-suspended-after-worker-falls-to-his-death/ Demolition Of Crawford Coal Plant Suspended After Worker Falls To His Death]\", ''Book Club Chicago''.

It mostly focused on ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on A&E between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. The novel was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as tourist attractions and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, a [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\nConvicted killer [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]], vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed.\n\nNorman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]).\n\nOne of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel.\n\nNorman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in.\n\nBelieving the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police.\n\nMary eventually finds Norman in the attic. The sheriff questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder.\n\nMary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother.\n\nMary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar.\n\nWhile removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar. Meanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk.\n\nRealizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house.\n\nA stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police.\n\nThe sheriff inaccurately believes Mary committed all the murders. That evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner.\n\nNorman gives her a cup of tea. Ms. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Ms. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel.\n\nNorman is now completely insane again. He carries Ms. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nThe film begins with Maureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his \"true\" mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician in his 20s desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles Marion Crane ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase Norman freaks out and leaves the diner.\n\nAfter the conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red (''[[Friday the 13th: A New Beginning]]'''s [[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship.\n\nThe same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the [[Psycho (1960 film)|original]]) gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\". At that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\"\n\nShe discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nIn 1987, [[NBC]] released a [[television film]] spin-off entitled ''Bates Motel''. The film follows Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]), a man who roomed with [[Norman Bates]] at the state lunatic asylum for nearly 20 years. After the death of Bates, Alex finds that he is in Norman's will as the inheritor of the Bates Motel, which has been vacant since the time of Norman's arrest. Alex travels to Fairville, California and with a little help from a teenage runaway named Willie ([[Lori Petty]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, only to have strange things happen. Is someone trying to drive him away, or is the motel really haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother?\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950 Norman's mother, Norma Bates ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to stab her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original. He describes it as a \"Slow, stilted, completely pointless scene-for-scene remake of the Hitchcock classic (with a few awkward new touches to taint its claim as an exact replica.)\" He ultimately calls it \"an insult, rather than a tribute to a landmark film.\"{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Continuity===\nWhile ''Bates Motel'' (1987) was a partial continuation of the series as it continued from where ''Psycho'' left off, it ignored the continuity of ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'', and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' due to the death of Norman Bates in the film and the fact that Bates is deemed sane and returns to the Bates Motel in ''Psycho II''. ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

All three sequels have been nominated for Saturn Awards. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at Universal City Studios in 1959 for the production of ''Psycho''. It has been said that the house, designed by art director's Joseph Hurley and Robert Clathworthy, was loosely based on an Edward Hopper painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''The Virginian'' and ''Boris Karloff's Mystery Theater''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented Studio Tram Tour. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' from the early 1990s featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular Angela Lansbury series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built Universal Studios Florida. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a direct-to-DVD documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director Alfred Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===2017 documentary: \"78/52\"===\n\nA documentary on the production of ''Psycho'' was released on Oct 13, 2017 by director Alexandre O. Philippe running 91 minutes.

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]]. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on A&E between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. The novel was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as tourist attractions and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, a [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\nConvicted killer [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]], vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed.\n\nNorman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]).\n\nOne of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel.\n\nNorman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in.\n\nBelieving the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police.\n\nMary eventually finds Norman in the attic. The sheriff questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder.\n\nMary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother.\n\nMary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar.\n\nWhile removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar. Meanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk.\n\nRealizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house.\n\nA stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police.\n\nThe sheriff inaccurately believes Mary committed all the murders. That evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner.\n\nNorman gives her a cup of tea. Ms. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Ms. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel.\n\nNorman is now completely insane again. He carries Ms. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nThe film begins with Maureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his \"true\" mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician in his 20s desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles Marion Crane ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase Norman freaks out and leaves the diner.\n\nAfter the conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red (''[[Friday the 13th: A New Beginning]]'''s [[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship.\n\nThe same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the [[Psycho (1960 film)|original]]) gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\". At that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\"\n\nShe discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nIn 1987, [[NBC]] released a [[television film]] spin-off entitled ''Bates Motel''. The film follows Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]), a man who roomed with [[Norman Bates]] at the state lunatic asylum for nearly 20 years. After the death of Bates, Alex finds that he is in Norman's will as the inheritor of the Bates Motel, which has been vacant since the time of Norman's arrest. Alex travels to Fairville, California and with a little help from a teenage runaway named Willie ([[Lori Petty]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, only to have strange things happen. Is someone trying to drive him away, or is the motel really haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother?\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950 Norman's mother, Norma Bates ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to stab her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

All three sequels have been nominated for Saturn Awards. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at Universal City Studios in 1959 for the production of ''Psycho''. It has been said that the house, designed by art director's Joseph Hurley and Robert Clathworthy, was loosely based on an Edward Hopper painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''The Virginian'' and ''Boris Karloff's Mystery Theater''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented Studio Tram Tour. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' from the early 1990s featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular Angela Lansbury series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built Universal Studios Florida. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a direct-to-DVD documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director Alfred Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===2017 documentary: \"78/52\"===\n\nA documentary on the production of ''Psycho'' was released on Oct 13, 2017 by director Alexandre O. Philippe running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included Guillermo del Toro, Peter Bogdanovich, Bret Easton Ellis, Jamie Lee Curtis, Karyn Kusama, Eli Roth, Oz Perkins, Leigh Whannell, Walter Murch, Danny Elfman, Elijah Wood, Richard Stanley, and Neil Marshall.<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

By the treaty of St. Mary's in 1818 considerably more territory became property of the government and this included Brown County Land.  No settler was allowed in the area until the government survey was completed in 1820.  The first white man known to arrive was a German, Johann Schoonover, who lived for a short time on the creek later named for him to trade with the Native Americans, about 1820.  In that same year William Elkins, the first pioneer, built a log cabin and cleared land in what became Johnson Township.<ref name=\"Blanchard\">{{cite book |last = Blanchard |first = Charles |title = Counties of Morgan, Monroe and Brown, Indiana: Historical and Biographical |url= https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_vyqC5iVmYtYC |page = [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_vyqC5iVmYtYC/page/n295 3] |publisher = F.A. Battey & Co |location= Chicago |year = 1884}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest pioneers came from Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and the Carolinas.  They crossed the Ohio River and traveled north on narrow Indian trails through dense hardwood forest with wagons drawn by oxen.  Many made their way to Bloomington, then east to hilly country, or they reached Jackson County and came north into future Brown County on the Sparks Ferry Road, or west from Columbus in Bartholomew County.  Pioneers who had settled on lowland near Columbus came to the hills to escape malaria.  Others deliberately chose the hills having lived in mountains before they made the trip to Indiana in search of new land.  By 1830 an estimated 150 settlers had arrived; the United States census of 1840 reported 2,364 people. [[File:Brown-County-Szmurlo.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Covered bridge in Brown County, Indiana]]\n\nBy 1828 the Indiana State Legislature had divided the land of present-day Brown County between Monroe, Jackson, and Bartholomew counties.  In 1835 settlers presented a petition to the Legislature requesting a new county.  On February 4, 1836, both the House and Senate passed a bill providing for the formation from western Bartholomew, eastern Monroe, and northern Jackson counties of a county to be named for [[Jacob Brown|Gen. Jacob Brown]], who defeated the British at the [[Battle of Sackett's Harbor]] in the [[War of 1812]].<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R. S.

Nashville, then known as Jacksonburg, was chosen as the county seat.  Banner C. Brummett was appointed County Agent to lay out Nashville in lots to be sold at auction.<ref name=\"Blanchard\"/>  It was expected that money from the sale would help pay expenses of the county government.  The lots sold very slowly, for pioneers had little money, and funds were very short for a number of years.  In 1837 a log court house was built, and the first log jail.  They were built on the same lots on which the present court house and log jail stand.  Nashville, at that time, consisted of a cluster of log cabins and 75 people.\n\nThe country was very wild in 1836.  Bears, panthers, and wolves were plentiful.  The wolves were so numerous and destructive to livestock that the Commissioners paid $1 for every wolf pelt brought to them.<ref name=\"Blanchard\"/>  Settlers lived a rugged pioneer type of life for many years.  Their cabins and small settlements were mere niches in the great forest that covered hills and valleys.  The men hunted deer, rabbits, squirrels, wild turkeys and pigeons for food.  As soon as enough land was cleared they planted corn, potatoes, wheat, hops for yeast, flax, and tobacco.  Women made quilts, wove wool and flax into cloth, made the family clothes, carried water from a well or stream, cooked food in open fireplaces, raised the children, and nursed them when they were sick.\n\nBy the time Nashville was incorporated in 1872, water powered grist mills and sawmills were scattered over the county.  Each village served its own locality with at least one general store, a blacksmith shop, a church and a post office.  A doctor, sometimes more than one, lived in almost every village.  In 1881 there were 20 doctors in the county, and 37 churches - Methodist, United Brethren, Baptist, Christian, Presbyterian, and New Light.  There were many immigrants in Brown County at this time, including immigrants from England, Wales, Germany and elsewhere.  Two of the Presbyterian churches in the county had congregations that consisted entirely of Presybterians of Scottish descent who came to America from [[County Down]] and [[County Antrim]] in the northeastern part of [[Ireland]], in what has since become [[Northern Ireland]].  These immigrants were referred to by the rest of the community as being [[Scotch-Irish Americans|\"Scots-Irish\"]], however they referred to themselves as \"Ulstermen\" and \"Irish Presbyterians\".<ref>Brown County, Indiana: History and Families, 1836-1990, Volume 1 by Dorothy Birney Bailey, pg. 92; Brown County Historical Society - Turner Publishing Company, 1991. {{ISBN|9781563110252}}</ref>  Money continued to be scarce and much business was conducted by the barter system.  The first schools were built of logs, but by 1872 one-room frame school houses dotted the county; in 1900 there were 73.\n\nPeople farmed but they depended on forest products for cash.  Lumber was taken to Indianapolis, also tan bark, cross ties, hoop poles, and barrel staves.  The trees were cut recklessly and this led to deep trouble.  Since there was not enough farm land on the ridge tops and in the creek bottoms, trees were eliminated on the sides of hills.  Wheat and other crops were planted, and erosion began in earnest.  By 1900, soil was so completely washed from hillsides and creek bottoms that crops could not be grown.  Poverty was widespread and people began to leave the county in droves.  Cabins all over the hills and valleys stood empty.  In 1890, 10,308 people lived in Brown County.  By 1930 only 5,168 remained.  Not until 1980 did the population exceed the 1890 figure.\n\nIn 1900, villages were still the centers of Brown County life.  Travel by horseback, wagon, or carriage was exceedingly limited due to deeply rutted, rocky roads.  There were people in remote areas who never made a trip to Nashville their entire lives.  Many a family's only contact with the outside world was the huckster's weekly visit with his horse and wagon.  As a result, the pioneer way of life continued long after other counties had adopted a new pattern of living.\n\nIn 1905 the Illinois Central Railroad built a line from Indianapolis to [[Effingham, Illinois]]. The line ran from Morgantown across the southwest corner of Jackson Township.  Helmsburg was the main station.  Two trains a day from Indianapolis, and two from Effingham, brought freight, mail, and passengers.  Horse drawn hacks took people and wagons transported mail and freight from the station to Nashville.\n\nThe first cars appeared in Nashville in 1913.  Their use was strictly limited because of the very bad roads and because of the widespread belief, peculiar to Brown County, that cars were both autonomous and maleficent.  By necessity as the number of cars increased county roads were gradually improved.  By 1934 State Road 135 north from Nashville to Morgantown had been built and in that year was hardsurfaced.  State Road 46 between Bloomington and Nashville was worked on extensively until it was considered one of the best gravel roads in the state.  Some years later it was hard surfaced.\n\nIn 1907, artist [[T. C. Steele]] built a studio near Belmont in rural Brown County and Adolph Shulz came to Nashville and thus began the [[Brown County Art Colony]]. [[Will Vawter]], V.J. Cariani, [[Marie Goth]], C. Curry Bohn, Dale Bessire and others moved to Nashville.  The Brown County Art Gallery was opened in 1926.  In 1954 a larger gallery was built on East Main Street, and an Art Guild established a gallery in the old Minor House on Van Buren Street.  Nashville continues to be an art center and tourist attraction.\n\n[[Brown County State Park]] opened in 1931 offering many advantages: a lodge, cabins for rent, picnic areas, a swimming pool, and miles of trails.  And at present there is Yellowwood State Forest, the [[Hoosier National Forest]], [[Lake Monroe (Indiana)|Lake Monroe]] and [[Lake Lemon]].\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of {{convert|316.63|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|311.98|sqmi}} (or 98.53%) is land and {{convert|4.65|sqmi}} (or 1.47%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/> Brown County is tied with [[Benton County, Indiana|Benton County]] as the least densely populated county in Indiana.

By the treaty of St. Mary's in 1818 considerably more territory became property of the government and this included Brown County Land.  No settler was allowed in the area until the government survey was completed in 1820.  The first white man known to arrive was a German, Johann Schoonover, who lived for a short time on the creek later named for him to trade with the Native Americans, about 1820.  In that same year William Elkins, the first pioneer, built a log cabin and cleared land in what became Johnson Township.<ref name=\"Blanchard\">{{cite book |last = Blanchard |first = Charles |title = Counties of Morgan, Monroe and Brown, Indiana: Historical and Biographical |url= https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_vyqC5iVmYtYC |page = [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_vyqC5iVmYtYC/page/n295 3] |publisher = F.A. Battey & Co |location= Chicago |year = 1884}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest pioneers came from Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and the Carolinas.  They crossed the Ohio River and traveled north on narrow Indian trails through dense hardwood forest with wagons drawn by oxen.  Many made their way to Bloomington, then east to hilly country, or they reached Jackson County and came north into future Brown County on the Sparks Ferry Road, or west from Columbus in Bartholomew County.  Pioneers who had settled on lowland near Columbus came to the hills to escape malaria.  Others deliberately chose the hills having lived in mountains before they made the trip to Indiana in search of new land.  By 1830 an estimated 150 settlers had arrived; the United States census of 1840 reported 2,364 people. [[File:Brown-County-Szmurlo.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Covered bridge in Brown County, Indiana]]\n\nBy 1828 the Indiana State Legislature had divided the land of present-day Brown County between Monroe, Jackson, and Bartholomew counties.  In 1835 settlers presented a petition to the Legislature requesting a new county.  On February 4, 1836, both the House and Senate passed a bill providing for the formation from western Bartholomew, eastern Monroe, and northern Jackson counties of a county to be named for [[Jacob Brown|Gen. Jacob Brown]], who defeated the British at the [[Battle of Sackett's Harbor]] in the [[War of 1812]].<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R. S.

Nashville, then known as Jacksonburg, was chosen as the county seat.  Banner C. Brummett was appointed County Agent to lay out Nashville in lots to be sold at auction.<ref name=\"Blanchard\"/>  It was expected that money from the sale would help pay expenses of the county government.  The lots sold very slowly, for pioneers had little money, and funds were very short for a number of years.  In 1837 a log court house was built, and the first log jail.  They were built on the same lots on which the present court house and log jail stand.  Nashville, at that time, consisted of a cluster of log cabins and 75 people.\n\nThe country was very wild in 1836.  Bears, panthers, and wolves were plentiful.  The wolves were so numerous and destructive to livestock that the Commissioners paid $1 for every wolf pelt brought to them.<ref name=\"Blanchard\"/>  Settlers lived a rugged pioneer type of life for many years.  Their cabins and small settlements were mere niches in the great forest that covered hills and valleys.  The men hunted deer, rabbits, squirrels, wild turkeys and pigeons for food.  As soon as enough land was cleared they planted corn, potatoes, wheat, hops for yeast, flax, and tobacco.  Women made quilts, wove wool and flax into cloth, made the family clothes, carried water from a well or stream, cooked food in open fireplaces, raised the children, and nursed them when they were sick.\n\nBy the time Nashville was incorporated in 1872, water powered grist mills and sawmills were scattered over the county.  Each village served its own locality with at least one general store, a blacksmith shop, a church and a post office.  A doctor, sometimes more than one, lived in almost every village.  In 1881 there were 20 doctors in the county, and 37 churches - Methodist, United Brethren, Baptist, Christian, Presbyterian, and New Light.  There were many immigrants in Brown County at this time, including immigrants from England, Wales, Germany and elsewhere.  Two of the Presbyterian churches in the county had congregations that consisted entirely of Presybterians of Scottish descent who came to America from [[County Down]] and [[County Antrim]] in the northeastern part of [[Ireland]], in what has since become [[Northern Ireland]].  These immigrants were referred to by the rest of the community as being [[Scotch-Irish Americans|\"Scots-Irish\"]], however they referred to themselves as \"Ulstermen\" and \"Irish Presbyterians\".<ref>Brown County, Indiana: History and Families, 1836-1990, Volume 1 by Dorothy Birney Bailey, pg. 92; Brown County Historical Society - Turner Publishing Company, 1991. {{ISBN|9781563110252}}</ref>  Money continued to be scarce and much business was conducted by the barter system.  The first schools were built of logs, but by 1872 one-room frame school houses dotted the county; in 1900 there were 73.\n\nPeople farmed but they depended on forest products for cash.  Lumber was taken to Indianapolis, also tan bark, cross ties, hoop poles, and barrel staves.  The trees were cut recklessly and this led to deep trouble.  Since there was not enough farm land on the ridge tops and in the creek bottoms, trees were eliminated on the sides of hills.  Wheat and other crops were planted, and erosion began in earnest.  By 1900, soil was so completely washed from hillsides and creek bottoms that crops could not be grown.  Poverty was widespread and people began to leave the county in droves.  Cabins all over the hills and valleys stood empty.  In 1890, 10,308 people lived in Brown County.  By 1930 only 5,168 remained.  Not until 1980 did the population exceed the 1890 figure.\n\nIn 1900, villages were still the centers of Brown County life.  Travel by horseback, wagon, or carriage was exceedingly limited due to deeply rutted, rocky roads.  There were people in remote areas who never made a trip to Nashville their entire lives.  Many a family's only contact with the outside world was the huckster's weekly visit with his horse and wagon.  As a result, the pioneer way of life continued long after other counties had adopted a new pattern of living.\n\nIn 1905 the Illinois Central Railroad built a line from Indianapolis to [[Effingham, Illinois]]. The line ran from Morgantown across the southwest corner of Jackson Township.  Helmsburg was the main station.  Two trains a day from Indianapolis, and two from Effingham, brought freight, mail, and passengers.  Horse drawn hacks took people and wagons transported mail and freight from the station to Nashville.\n\nThe first cars appeared in Nashville in 1913.  Their use was strictly limited because of the very bad roads and because of the widespread belief, peculiar to Brown County, that cars were both autonomous and maleficent.  By necessity as the number of cars increased county roads were gradually improved.  By 1934 State Road 135 north from Nashville to Morgantown had been built and in that year was hardsurfaced.  State Road 46 between Bloomington and Nashville was worked on extensively until it was considered one of the best gravel roads in the state.  Some years later it was hard surfaced.\n\nIn 1907, artist [[T. C. Steele]] built a studio near Belmont in rural Brown County and Adolph Shulz came to Nashville and thus began the [[Brown County Art Colony]]. [[Will Vawter]], V.J. Cariani, [[Marie Goth]], C. Curry Bohn, Dale Bessire and others moved to Nashville.  The Brown County Art Gallery was opened in 1926.  In 1954 a larger gallery was built on East Main Street, and an Art Guild established a gallery in the old Minor House on Van Buren Street.  Nashville continues to be an art center and tourist attraction.\n\n[[Brown County State Park]] opened in 1931 offering many advantages: a lodge, cabins for rent, picnic areas, a swimming pool, and miles of trails.

He is remembered for strongly defending [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and for advancing the concept of minority rights in politics, which he did in the context of protecting the interests of the white [[Southern United States|South]] when it was outnumbered by [[Northern United States|Northerners]]. He began his political career as a nationalist, [[Modernization theory|modernizer]], and proponent of a strong national government and [[protectionism|protective tariffs]]. In the late 1820s, his views changed radically, and he became a leading proponent of [[states' rights]], [[limited government]], [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]], and [[free trade|opposition to high tariffs]]\u2014he saw Northern acceptance of these policies as a condition of the South remaining in the Union. His beliefs and warnings heavily influenced the South's [[Secession in the United States#Confederate States of America|secession from the Union in 1860\u20131861]].\n\nCalhoun began his political career with election to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1810. As a prominent leader of the [[war hawk]] faction, Calhoun strongly supported the [[War of 1812]] to defend American honor against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] infractions of American independence and neutrality during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He then served as [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] under President [[James Monroe]], and in this position reorganized and modernized the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]. Calhoun was a candidate for the presidency in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 election]]. After failing to gain support, he let his name be put forth as a candidate for vice president. The [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] elected Calhoun for vice president by an overwhelming majority. He served under [[John Quincy Adams]] and continued under [[Andrew Jackson]], who defeated Adams in the [[1828 United States presidential election|election of 1828]].\n\nCalhoun had a difficult relationship with Jackson primarily due to the [[Nullification Crisis]] and the [[Petticoat affair]]. In contrast with his previous nationalism, Calhoun vigorously supported South Carolina's right to nullify federal tariff legislation he believed unfairly favored the North, putting him into conflict with unionists such as Jackson. In 1832, with only a few months remaining in his second term, he resigned as vice president and entered the [[United States Senate|Senate]], making him the first former vice president to do so.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} He sought the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] nomination for the presidency in [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]], but lost to surprise nominee [[James K. Polk]], who went on to become president. Calhoun served as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under [[John Tyler]] from 1844 to 1845. As Secretary of State, he supported the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] as a means to extend the [[slave power]], and helped settle the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] with Britain. He then returned to the Senate, where he opposed the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the [[Wilmot Proviso]], and the [[Compromise of 1850]] before his death in 1850. Calhoun often served as a virtual party-independent who variously aligned as needed with Democrats and [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]].\n\nLater in life, Calhoun became known as the \"cast-iron man\" for his rigid defense of white Southern beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Coit|1950|pp=70\u201371}}{{sfn|Miller|1996|pp=115\u2013116}} His concept of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] emphasized approval of slavery and minority rights, as particularly embodied by the Southern states. His concept of minority rights did not extend to slaves; he owned dozens of slaves in [[Fort Hill (Clemson, South Carolina)|Fort Hill]], South Carolina. Calhoun asserted that slavery, rather than being a \"[[necessary evil]],\" was a \"[[Slavery as a positive good in the United States|positive good]],\" benefiting both slaves and slave owners.<ref name=\"whathesaid\">{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Clyde N. |url=http://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/clyde-wilson-library/john-c-calhoun-and-slavery-as-a-positive-good-what-he-said |title=John C. Calhoun and Slavery as a 'Positive Good': What He Said |publisher=The Abbeville Institute |date=June 26, 2014 |access-date=June 6, 2016}}</ref> To protect minority rights against majority rule, he called for a [[concurrent majority]] whereby the minority could sometimes block proposals that it felt infringed on their liberties. To this end, Calhoun supported states' rights and nullification, through which states could declare null and void federal laws that they viewed as unconstitutional. Calhoun was one of the \"[[Great Triumvirate]]\" or the \"Immortal Trio\" of [[United States Congress|Congressional]] leaders, along with his Congressional colleagues [[Daniel Webster]] and [[Henry Clay]]. In 1957, a Senate Committee headed by Senator [[John F.

Calhoun.svg|thumb|upright|Coat of Arms of John C. Calhoun]]\nJohn Caldwell Calhoun was born in [[Abbeville County, South Carolina|Abbeville District, South Carolina]] on March 18, 1782, the fourth child of [[Patrick Calhoun (immigrant)|Patrick Calhoun]] (1727\u20131796) and his wife Martha Caldwell. Patrick's father, also named Patrick Calhoun, had joined the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] immigration movement from [[County Donegal]] to southwestern [[Pennsylvania]]. After the death of the elder Patrick in 1741, the family moved to southwestern [[Virginia]]. Following the defeat of British General [[Edward Braddock]] at the [[Battle of the Monongahela]] in 1755, the family, fearing Indian attacks, moved to South Carolina in 1756.{{sfn|Coit |1950|p=3}}{{sfn|Niven|1988|pp=6\u20138}} Patrick Calhoun belonged to the Calhoun clan in the tight-knit Scotch-Irish community on the Southern frontier. He was known as an [[American Indian Wars|Indian fighter]] and an ambitious surveyor, farmer, planter and politician, being a member of the [[South Carolina General Assembly|South Carolina Legislature]]. As a Presbyterian, he stood opposed to the Anglican elite based in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. He was a Patriot in the [[American Revolution]], and opposed [[History of the United States Constitution#Ratification of the Constitution|ratification of the federal Constitution]] on grounds of states' rights and personal liberties. Calhoun would eventually adopt his father's states' rights beliefs.{{sfn|Wiltse|1944|pp=15\u201324}}{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=10}}\n\nYoung Calhoun showed scholastic talent, and although schools were scarce on the Carolina frontier, he was enrolled briefly in an academy in [[Appling, Georgia]], which soon closed. He continued his studies privately. When his father died, his brothers were away starting business careers, and so the 14-year-old Calhoun took over management of the family farm and five other farms. For four years he simultaneously kept up his reading and his hunting and fishing. The family decided he should continue his education, and so he resumed studies at the Academy after it reopened.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\">{{cite web |url= https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_John_Calhoun.htm |title= John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832) |publisher= United States Senate |access-date= May 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith financing from his brothers, he went to [[Yale University|Yale College]] in Connecticut in 1802. For the first time in his life, Calhoun encountered serious, advanced, well-organized intellectual dialogue that could shape his mind. Yale was dominated by President [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], a [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] who became his mentor. Dwight's brilliance entranced (and sometimes repelled) Calhoun. Biographer John Niven says:\n\n{{quote|quote=Calhoun admired Dwight's extemporaneous sermons, his seemingly encyclopedic knowledge, and his awesome mastery of the classics, of the tenets of [[Calvinism]], and of [[metaphysics]]. No one, he thought, could explicate the language of [[John Locke]] with such clarity.{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=18}}}}\n\nDwight repeatedly denounced [[Jeffersonian democracy]], and Calhoun challenged him in class. Dwight could not shake Calhoun's commitment to republicanism. \"Young man,\" retorted Dwight, \"your talents are of a high order and might justify you for any station, but I deeply regret that you do not love sound principles better than [[Sophist#Modern usage|sophistry]]\u2014you seem to possess a most unfortunate bias for error.\"{{sfn|Capers|1960|pp=1\u20132}} Dwight also expounded on the strategy of secession from the Union as a legitimate solution for [[New England]]'s disagreements with the national government.{{sfn|Calhoun|Post|1995|p=xii}}{{sfn|Douglas|2009|p= 368}}\n\nCalhoun made friends easily, read widely, and was a noted member of the debating society of [[Brothers in Unity]].

He was raised Calvinist but was attracted to Southern varieties of [[Unitarianism]] of the sort that attracted Jefferson.

He immediately became a leader of the [[War Hawk]]s, along with Speaker [[Henry Clay]] of Kentucky and South Carolina congressmen [[William Lowndes (congressman)|William Lowndes]] and [[Langdon Cheves]]. Brushing aside the vehement objections of both anti-war New Englanders and arch-conservative [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonians]] led by [[John Randolph of Roanoke]], they demanded war against Britain to preserve American honor and republican values, which had been violated by the British refusal to recognize American shipping rights.<ref name=\"John C.

Drawing on the linguistic tradition of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], Calhoun's committee called for a declaration of war in ringing phrases, denouncing Britain's \"lust for power\", \"unbounded tyranny\", and \"mad ambition\".<ref>\"War Report of 1812,\" ''Papers of John C.

The opening phase involved multiple disasters for American arms, as well as a financial crisis when the Treasury could barely pay the bills. The conflict caused economic hardship for the Americans, as the [[Royal Navy]] blockaded the ports and cut off imports, exports and the coastal trade. Several attempted invasions of [[Canada]] were fiascos, but the U.S. in 1813 seized control of [[Southwestern Ontario|Lake Erie]] and broke the power of hostile Indians in battles such as the [[Battle of the Thames]] in Canada in 1813 and the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] in Alabama in 1814. These Indians had, in many cases, cooperated with the British or [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in opposing American interests.{{sfn|Stagg|2012|pp=117, 161}}\n\nCalhoun labored to raise troops, provide funds, speed logistics, rescue the currency, and regulate commerce to aid the war effort. One colleague hailed him as \"the young Hercules who carried the war on his shoulders.\"<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" /> Disasters on the battlefield made him double his legislative efforts to overcome the obstructionism of John Randolph, [[Daniel Webster]], and other opponents of the war. In December 1814, with the armies of [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] apparently defeated, and the British [[Battle of Plattsburgh|invasions of New York]] and [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]] thwarted, British and American diplomats signed the [[Treaty of Ghent]]. It called for a return to the borders of 1812 with no gains or losses. Before the treaty reached the Senate for ratification, and even before news of its signing reached New Orleans, a massive British invasion force was utterly defeated in January 1815 at the [[Battle of New Orleans]], making a national hero of General [[Andrew Jackson]]. Americans celebrated what they called a \"second war of independence\" against Britain. This led to the beginning of the \"[[Era of Good Feelings]]\", an era marked by the formal demise of the Federalist Party and increased nationalism.{{sfn|Langguth|2006|pp=375, 387}}\n\n===Postwar planning===\nDespite American successes, the mismanagement of the Army during the war distressed Calhoun, and he resolved to strengthen and centralize the War Department.{{sfn|Wiltse|1944|pp=103\u2013105}} The militia had proven itself quite unreliable during the war and Calhoun saw the need for a permanent and professional military force. In 1816 he called for building an effective navy, including steam frigates, as well as a standing army of adequate size. The British blockade of the coast had underscored the necessity of rapid means of internal transportation; Calhoun proposed a system of \"great permanent roads\". The blockade had cut off the import of manufactured items, so he emphasized the need to encourage more domestic manufacture, fully realizing that industry was based in the Northeast. The dependence of the old financial system on import duties was devastated when the blockade cut off imports. Calhoun called for a system of internal taxation that would not collapse from a war-time shrinkage of maritime trade, as the tariffs had done. The expiration of the charter of the [[First Bank of the United States]] had also distressed the Treasury, so to reinvigorate and modernize the economy Calhoun called for a new national bank. A new bank was chartered as the [[Second Bank of the United States]] by Congress and approved by President [[James Madison]] in 1816. Through his proposals, Calhoun emphasized a national footing and downplayed sectionalism and states rights. Historian [[Ulrich Bonnell Phillips|Ulrich B. Phillips]] says that at this stage of Calhoun's career, \"The word ''nation'' was often on his lips, and his conviction was to enhance national unity which he identified with national power.\"{{sfn|Phillips|1929|loc=3:412\u2013414}}\n\n===Rhetorical style===\nRegarding his career in the House of Representatives, an observer commented that Calhoun was \"the most elegant speaker that sits in the House&nbsp;... His gestures are easy and graceful, his manner forcible, and language elegant; but above all, he confines himself closely to the subject, which he always understands, and enlightens everyone within hearing.\"{{sfn|Jewett|1908|p=143}}\n\nHis talent for public speaking required systematic self-discipline and practice. A later critic noted the sharp contrast between his hesitant conversations and his fluent speaking styles, adding that Calhoun \"had so carefully cultivated his naturally poor voice as to make his utterance clear, full, and distinct in speaking and while not at all musical it yet fell pleasantly on the ear\".{{sfn|Meigs|1917|loc=Vol. 1, p. 221}} Calhoun was \"a high-strung man of ultra intellectual cast\".{{sfn|Meigs|1917|loc=Vol. 2, p. 8}} As such, Calhoun was not known for charisma. He was often seen as harsh and aggressive with other representatives.{{sfn|Peterson|1988| pp= 280, 408}}{{sfn|Hofstadter|2011|p=96}} But he was a brilliant intellectual orator and strong organizer. Historian [[Russell Kirk]] says, \"That zeal which flared like Greek fire in Randolph burned in Calhoun, too; but it was contained in the Cast-iron Man as in a furnace, and Calhoun's passion glowed out only through his eyes. No man was more stately, more reserved.\"{{sfn|Kirk|2001|p=168}}\n\nJohn Quincy Adams concluded in 1821 that \"Calhoun is a man of fair and candid mind, of honorable principles, of clear and quick understanding, of cool self-possession, of enlarged philosophical views, and of ardent patriotism. He is above all sectional and factious prejudices more than any other statesman of this Union with whom I have ever acted.\"{{sfn|von Holst|1883|p=54}} Historian Charles Wiltse noted Calhoun's evolution, \"Though he is known today primarily for his sectionalism, Calhoun was the last of the great political leaders of his time to take a sectional position\u2014later than Daniel Webster, later than Henry Clay, later than Adams himself.\"{{sfn|Wiltse|1944|p=234}}\n\n==Secretary of War and postwar nationalism==\n[[File:JCCalhoun-1822.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1822 portrait of Calhoun at the age of 40|alt=oil painting, 3/4 left side profile, with tied white bow tie scarf and dark blazer with gold buttons.

Calhoun took office on December 8 and served until 1825.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" /> He continued his role as a leading nationalist during the Era of Good Feelings. He proposed an elaborate program of national reforms to the infrastructure that he believed would speed economic modernization. His first priority was an effective navy, including steam frigates, and in the second place a standing army of adequate size\u2014and as further preparation for emergency, \"great permanent roads\", \"a certain encouragement\" to manufactures, and a system of internal taxation that would not collapse from a war-time shrinkage of maritime trade, like customs duties.{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=54}}\n\nA reform-minded modernizer, Calhoun attempted to institute centralization and efficiency in the Indian Department and in the Army by establishing new coastal and frontier fortifications and building military roads, but Congress either failed to respond to his reforms or responded with hostility. Calhoun's frustration with congressional inaction, political rivalries, and ideological differences spurred him to create the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] in 1824.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" />{{sfn|Belko|2004|pp=170\u2013197}} The responsibilities of the bureau were to manage treaty negotiations, schools, and trade with Indians, in addition to handling all expenditures and correspondence concerning Indian affairs.

He promoted a plan, adopted by Monroe in 1825, to preserve the sovereignty of eastern Indians by [[Indian removal|relocating]] them to western reservations they could control without interference from state governments.{{sfn|Satz|1974|pp=2\u20137}} In over seven years Calhoun supervised the negotiation and ratification of 40 treaties with Indian tribes.{{sfn|Prucha|1997|p=155}} Calhoun opposed the invasion of [[Spanish Florida]] launched in 1818 by General Jackson during the [[First Seminole War]], which was done without direct authorization from Calhoun or President Monroe, and in private with other cabinet members, advocated censuing of Jackson as punishment. Calhoun claimed that Jackson had begun a war against Spain in violation of the Constitution and, falsely, that he had contradicted Calhoun's explicit orders in doing so. No official instructions not to invade Florida or attack the Spanish were ever issued by the administration.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=366}} However, Calhoun supported the [[Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident|execution of Alexander Arbuthnot and Robert Ambrister]], two British soldiers living in Florida who were accused of inciting the Seminole to make war against the United States. Calhoun accused the British of being involved in \"wickedness, corruption, and barbarity at which the heart sickens and which in this enlightened age it ought not scarcely to be believed that a christian nation would have participated.\" He added that he hoped the executions of Arbuthnot and Ambrister would deter the British and any other nations \"who by false promises delude and excite an Indian tribe to all the deeds of savage war.\"{{sfn|Remini|1977|pp=358\u2013359}} The United States annexed Florida from Spain in 1819 through the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]].<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" />\n\nCalhoun's tenure as Secretary of War witnessed the outbreak of the [[Missouri Compromise|Missouri crisis]] in December 1818, when a petition arrived from Missouri settlers seeking admission into the Union as a slave state. In response, Representative [[James Tallmadge Jr.]] of New York proposed two amendments to the bill designed to restrict the spread of slavery into what would become the new state. This amendments touched off an intense debate between North and South that had some talking openly of disunion. In February 1820, Calhoun predicted to Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]], a New Englander, that the Missouri issue \"would not produce a dissolution\" of the Union. \"But if it should,\" Calhoun went on, \"the South would of necessity be compelled to form an alliance with...Great Britain.\" \"I said that would be returning to the colonial state,\" Adams recalled saying afterwards. According to Adams, \"He said, yes, pretty much, but it would be forced upon them.\"{{sfn|Baptist|2014|pp=154\u2013156}}\n\nAfter the war ended in 1815 the \"[[Old Republicans]]\" in Congress, with their Jeffersonian ideology for economy in the federal government, sought to reduce the operations and finances of the War Department. Calhoun's political rivalry with [[William H. Crawford]], the Secretary of the Treasury, over the pursuit of the presidency in the 1824 election, complicated Calhoun's tenure as War Secretary. The general lack of military action following the war meant that a large army, such as that preferred by Calhoun, was no longer considered necessary. The \"Radicals\", a group of strong states' rights supporters who mostly favored Crawford for president in the coming election, were inherently suspicious of large armies. Some allegedly also wanted to hinder Calhoun's own presidential aspirations for that election.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" /> Thus, on March 2, 1821, Congress passed the Reduction Act, which reduced the number of enlisted men of the army by half, from 11,709 to 5,586, and the number of the officer corps by a fifth, from 680 to 540. Calhoun, though concerned, offered little protest. Later, to provide the army with a more organized command structure, which had been severely lacking during the War of 1812, he appointed Major General [[Jacob Brown]] to a position that would later become known as \"[[Commanding General of the United States Army]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/amh-v1/ch07.htm |title=7: Toward a Professional Army |publisher=United States Army |access-date=August 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Vice Presidency==\n===1824 and 1828 elections and Adams presidency===\n[[File:Fort Hill (Clemson, SC) Historic Marker.JPG|thumb|upright|State historic marker at [[Fort Hill (Clemson, South Carolina)|Fort Hill]], Calhoun's home from 1825 until his death in 1850|alt=Large cast embossed concrete or metal panel atop a metal post.

Calhoun also expressed some concerns, which caused friction between him and Adams.<ref name=\"Roesch, James Rutledge\">{{cite web |url= http://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/review/john-c-calhoun-and-states-rights/ |author= Roesch, James Rutledge. |date= August 25, 2015 |title= John C.

Calhoun became disillusioned with Adams' high tariff policies and increased centralization of government through a network of \"internal improvements\", which he now saw as a threat to the rights of the states. Calhoun wrote to Jackson on June 4, 1826, informing him that he would support Jackson's second campaign for the presidency in [[1828 United States presidential election|1828]]. The two were never particularly close friends. Calhoun never fully trusted Jackson, a frontiersman and popular war hero, but hoped that his election would bring some reprieve from Adams's anti-states' rights policies.<ref name=\"John C.

Hamilton spoke about this prospect with Governor [[John Forsyth (Georgia)|John Forsyth]] of Georgia, who acted as a mediator between the Jackson campaign and Crawford. Forsyth wrote a letter back to Hamilton in which he claimed that Crawford had stated to him that it was Calhoun, not Crawford, who had supported censuring Jackson for his invasion of Florida. Knowing that the letter could destroy the partnership between Jackson and Calhoun, Hamilton and fellow-Jackson aide [[William Berkeley Lewis|William B.

They alleged that John and Peggy Eaton had engaged in an adulterous affair while she was still legally married to her first husband, and that her recent behavior was unladylike. The allegations of scandal created an intolerable situation for Jackson. The Petticoat affair ended friendly relations between Calhoun and Jackson.{{sfn|Marszalek|2000|p=84}}\n\nJackson sided with the Eatons. He and his late wife [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel Donelson]] had undergone similar political attacks stemming from their marriage in 1791. The two had married in 1791 not knowing that Rachel's first husband, Lewis Robards, had failed to finalize the expected divorce. Once the divorce was finalized, they married legally in 1794, but the episode caused a major controversy, and was used against him in the 1828 campaign. Jackson saw attacks on Eaton stemming ultimately from the political opposition of Calhoun, who had failed to silence his wife's criticisms. The Calhouns were widely regarded as the chief instigators.<ref name=\"Floride Bonneau Colhoun Calhoun\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehermitage.com/learn/andrew-jackson/family/rachel/ |title=Rachel Jackson |publisher=The Hermitage |access-date=August 17, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817072639/http://thehermitage.com/learn/andrew-jackson/family/rachel/ |archivedate=August 17, 2016 }}</ref> Jackson, who loved to personalize disputes,{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=14\u201315}} also saw the Petticoat affair as a direct challenge to his authority, because it involved lower-ranking executive officials and their wives seeming to contest his ability to choose whomever he wanted for his cabinet.{{sfn|Bates|2015|p=315}} Secretary of State [[Martin Van Buren]], a widower, took Jackson's side and defended the Eatons.{{sfn|McKellar|1942|p=151}} Van Buren was a northerner and a supporter of the 1828 tariff (which Calhoun bitterly opposed). Calhoun and Van Buren were the main contenders for the vice presidential nomination in the ensuing election, and the nominee would then presumably be the party's choice to succeed Jackson.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=243}} That Van Buren sided with the Eatons, in addition to disagreements between Jackson and Calhoun on other issues, mainly the [[Nullification Crisis]], marked him as Calhoun's likely vice presidential successor.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=337\u2013339}}\n\nSome historians, including Jackson biographers Richard B. Latner and [[Robert V. Remini]], believe that the hostility towards the Eatons was rooted less in questions of proper behavior than in politics. Eaton had been in favor of the Tariff of Abominations. He was also politically close to Van Buren. Calhoun may have wanted to expel Eaton from the cabinet as a way of boosting his anti-tariff agenda and increasing his standing in the Democratic Party. Many cabinet members were Southern and could be expected to sympathize with such concerns, especially Treasury Secretary [[Samuel D. Ingham]], who was allied with Calhoun and believed that he, not Van Buren, should succeed Jackson as president.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=243}}\n\nIn 1830, reports had emerged accurately stating that Calhoun, as Secretary of War, had favored censuring Jackson for his 1818 invasion of Florida. These infuriated Jackson.{{sfn|Cheathem|2008|p=29}} Eventually, Lewis decided to reveal the existence of Forsyth's letter, and on April 30, Crawford wrote a second letter, this time to Forsyth, repeating the charge Forsyth represented him as having previously made. Jackson received the letter on May 12, which confirmed his suspicions. He claimed that Calhoun had \"betrayed\" him.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=242\u2013243}} Eaton took his revenge on Calhoun. For reasons unclear, Calhoun asked Eaton to approach Jackson about the possibility of Calhoun publishing his correspondence with Jackson at the time of the Seminole War. Eaton did nothing, leading Calhoun to believe that Jackson had approved the publication of the letters.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=306\u2013307}} Calhoun published them in the ''United States Telegraph,'' a newspaper edited by a Calhoun prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Duff Green]].<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\"/> This gave the appearance of Calhoun trying to justify himself against a conspiracy to damage him, and further enraged the President.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=306\u2013307}}\n\nFinally in the spring of 1831, at the suggestion of Van Buren, who, like Jackson, supported the Eatons, Jackson replaced all but one of his Cabinet members, thereby limiting Calhoun's influence. Van Buren began the process by resigning as Secretary of State, facilitating Jackson's removal of others. Van Buren thereby grew in favor with Jackson, while the rift between the President and Calhoun was widened.{{sfn|Marszalek|2000|p=121}} Later, in 1832, Calhoun, as vice president, cast a tie-breaking vote against Jackson's nomination of Van Buren as [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Minister to Great Britain]] in a failed attempt to end Van Buren's political career. Missouri Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]], a staunch supporter of Jackson, then stated that Calhoun had \"elected a Vice President\", as Van Buren was able to move past his failed nomination as Minister to Great Britain and instead gain the Democratic Party's vice presidential nomination in the [[1832 United States presidential election|1832 election]], in which he and Jackson were victorious.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" />\n\n===Nullification===\n{{See also|Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|Nullification Crisis}}\nCalhoun had begun to oppose increases in protective tariffs, as they generally benefited Northerners more than Southerners. While he was Vice President in the Adams administration, Jackson's supporters devised a high tariff legislation that placed duties on imports that were also made in New England. Calhoun had been assured that the northeastern interests would reject the [[Tariff of Abominations|Tariff of 1828]], exposing pro-Adams New England congressmen to charges that they selfishly opposed legislation popular among [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian Democrats]] in the west and mid-Atlantic States. The southern legislators miscalculated and the so-called \"Tariff of Abominations\" passed and was signed into law by President Adams. Frustrated, Calhoun returned to his South Carolina plantation, where he anonymously composed ''[[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]]'', an essay rejecting the centralization philosophy and supporting the principle of nullification as a means to prevent tyranny of a central government.{{sfn|Niven|1988|pp=158\u2013161}}\n\nCalhoun supported the idea of nullification through a [[concurrent majority]]. Nullification is a legal theory that a state has the right to nullify, or invalidate, any federal law it deems unconstitutional. In Calhoun's words, it is \"the right of a State to interpose, in the last resort, in order to arrest an unconstitutional act of the General Government, within its limits.\"{{sfn|Crall\u00e9|1888|p=96}} Nullification can be traced back to arguments by Jefferson and Madison in writing the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]] of 1798 against the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]]. Madison expressed the hope that the states would declare the acts unconstitutional, while Jefferson explicitly endorsed nullification.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/primary-source-documents/virginia-and-kentucky-resolutions/ |title = Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions (1798) |publisher = Bill of Rights Institute |access-date = January 6, 2016 }}</ref> Calhoun openly argued for a state's right to secede from the Union, as a last resort to protect its liberty and sovereignty. In his later years, Madison rebuked supporters of nullification, stating that no state had the right to nullify federal law.{{sfn|Rutland|1997|pp=248\u2013249}}\n\nIn \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest\", Calhoun argued that a state could veto any federal law that went beyond the enumerated powers and encroached upon the residual powers of the State.{{sfn|Calhoun|1992|pp=348\u2013349}} President Jackson, meanwhile, generally supported states' rights, but opposed nullification and secession. At the 1830 [[Jefferson\u2013Jackson Day|Jefferson Day]] dinner at Jesse Brown's Indian Queen Hotel, Jackson proposed a toast and proclaimed, \"Our federal Union, it must be preserved.\"{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=173}} Calhoun replied, \"The Union, next to our liberty, the most dear. May we all remember that it can only be preserved by respecting the rights of the states, and distributing equally the benefit and burden of the Union.\"{{sfn|Brands|2005|p=446}} Calhoun's publication of letters from the Seminole War in the ''Telegraph'' caused his relationship with Jackson to deteriorate further, thus contributing to the Nullification crisis. Jackson and Calhoun began an angry correspondence that lasted until Jackson stopped it in July.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" />\n\nOn July 14, 1832, Jackson signed into law the [[Tariff of 1832]]. It was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates, but the nullifiers in South Carolina remained unsatisfied. On November 24, the South Carolina legislature officially nullified both the Tariff of 1832 and the Tariff of 1828, to be null and void as of February 1, 1833.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/24c.asp |title=The South Carolina Nullification Controversy |website= U.S. History.org |access-date=August 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/ordnull.asp |title=South Carolina Ordinance of Nullification, November 24, 1832 |publisher=Yale Law School |access-date=August 22, 2016}}</ref> In response, Jackson sent [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] warships to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] harbor, and threatened to hang Calhoun or any man who worked to support nullification or secession.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=405\u2013406}} After joining the Senate, Calhoun began to work with Clay on a new [[Tariff of 1833|compromise tariff]]. A bill sponsored by the administration had been introduced by Representative [[Gulian C. Verplanck]] of New York, but it lowered rates more sharply than Clay and other protectionists desired. Clay managed to get Calhoun to agree to a bill with higher rates in exchange for Clay's opposition to Jackson's military threats and, perhaps, with the hope that he could win some Southern votes in his next bid for the presidency.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=38}} On the same day, Congress passed the [[Force Bill]], which empowered the President of the United States to use military force to ensure state compliance with federal law. South Carolina accepted the tariff, but in a final show of defiance, nullified the Force Bill.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=406\u2013410}} In Calhoun's speech against the Force Bill, delivered on February 5, 1833, no longer as vice president, he strongly endorsed nullification, at one point saying:\n{{quote|Why, then, confer on the President the extensive and unlimited powers provided in this bill? Why authorize him to use military force to arrest the civil process of the State? But one answer can be given: That, in a contest between the State and the General Government, if the resistance be limited on both sides to the civil process, the State, by its inherent sovereignty, standing upon its reserved powers, will prove too powerful in such a controversy, and must triumph over the Federal Government, sustained by its delegated and limited authority; and in this answer we have an acknowledgment of the truth of those great principles for which the State has so firmly and nobly contended.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umsl.edu/virtualstl/phase2/1850/events/perspectives/documents/calhoun01.html |title=John C Calhoun: Against the Force Bill |last= Calhoun |first= John C. |publisher=University of Missouri |access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nIn his three-volume biography of Jackson, [[James Parton]] summed up Calhoun's role in the Nullification crisis: \"Calhoun began it.

Hayne]] was considered less capable than Calhoun to represent South Carolina in the Senate debates, so in late 1832 Hayne resigned to become governor; the South Carolina legislature elected Calhoun as his replacement. On December 28, Calhoun resigned as vice president to become a senator, with a voice in the debates. Van Buren had already been elected as Jackson's new vice president, meaning that Calhoun had less than three months left on his term anyway.{{sfn|Phillips|1929|pp=411\u2013419}} The South Carolina newspaper ''City Gazette'' commented on the change:\n{{quote|It is admitted that the former gentleman [Hayne] is injudiciously pitted against Clay and Webster and, nullification out of the question, Mr. Calhoun's place should be in front with these formidable politicians.{{sfn|Jervey|1909|p=315}}}}\n\nBiographer John Niven argues \"that these moves were part of a well-thought-out plan whereby Hayne would restrain the hotheads in the state legislature and Calhoun would defend his brainchild, nullification, in Washington against administration stalwarts and the likes of Daniel Webster, the new apostle of northern nationalism.\"{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=192}} Calhoun was the first of two vice presidents to resign, the second being [[Spiro Agnew]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/calhoun-resigns-vice-presidency |title = Calhoun resigns vice presidency |publisher = A&E Television |accessdate = December 26, 2011 }}</ref> During his terms as vice president, he made a record of 31 [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by vice presidents of the United States|tie-breaking votes in the Senate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/VPTies.pdf|title=Senate.gov: VPTies.pdf|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==First term in the U.S. Senate==\n[[File:John C.

Calhoun sometimes affiliated with the Whigs, but chose to remain a virtual independent due to the Whig promotion of federally subsidized \"internal improvements.\"{{sfn|Ashworth|1995|p=203}}\n\nFrom 1833 to 1834, Jackson was engaged in removing federal funds from the [[Second Bank of the United States]] during the [[Bank War]]. Calhoun opposed this action, considering it a dangerous expansion of executive power.{{sfn|Wilentz|2006|p=397}} He called the men of the Jackson administration \"artful, cunning, and corrupt politicians, and not fearless warriors.\" He accused Jackson of being ignorant on financial matters. As evidence, he cited the economic panic caused by [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]] as a means to stop Jackson from destroying the Bank.{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=42}} On March 28, 1834, Calhoun voted with the Whig senators on a successful motion to [[censure]] Jackson for his removal of the funds.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Reverses_A_Presidential_Censure.htm |title=Senate Reverses a Presidential Censure |publisher=United States Senate |access-date=August 20, 2017}}</ref> In 1837, he refused to attend the inauguration of Jackson's chosen successor, Van Buren, even as other powerful senators who opposed the administration, such as Webster and Clay, did witness the inauguration.{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=422}} However, by 1837 Calhoun generally had realigned himself with most of the Democrats' policies.{{sfn|Ashworth|1995|p=203}}\n\nTo restore his national stature, Calhoun cooperated with Van Buren. Democrats were hostile to national banks, and the country's bankers had joined the Whig Party. The Democratic replacement, meant to help combat the [[Panic of 1837]], was the [[Independent Treasury]] system, which Calhoun supported and which went into effect.{{sfn|Niven|1988|pp=62\u201363}} Calhoun, like Jackson and Van Buren, attacked finance capitalism and opposed what he saw as encroachment by government and big business.

Calhoun, U.S. Secretary of State.jpg|thumb|upright|Calhoun, during his tenure as Secretary of State (April 1844 \u2013 March 1845)]]\nUpshur's loss was a severe blow to the Tyler administration. When Calhoun was nominated as Upshur's replacement, the White House was well-advanced towards securing a treaty of annexation with Texas. The State Department's secret negotiations with the Texas republic had proceeded despite explicit threats from a suspicious Mexican government that an unauthorized seizure of its northern district of [[Coahuila y Tejas]] would be equivalent to an act of war.{{sfn|May|2008|p=105}} Both the negotiations with Texas envoys and the garnering of support from the U.S. Senate had been spearheaded aggressively by Secretary Upshur, a strong pro-slavery partisan.{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=677}} Tyler looked to its ratification by the Senate as the ''sine qua non'' to his ambition for another term in office. Tyler \"planned to outflank the Whigs by gaining support from the Democratic Party or possibly creating a new party of [discontented] Northern Democrats and Southern Whigs.\"{{sfn|May|2008|p=100}}\n\nCalhoun, though as avid a proponent for Texas acquisition as Upshur, posed a political liability to Tyler's aims.{{sfn|Holt|2004|p=35}} As secretary of state, Calhoun's political objective was to see that the presidency was placed in the hands of a southern [[Fire-Eaters|extremist]], who would put the expansion of slavery at the center of national policy.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=680\u2013681}}\n\nTyler and his allies had, since 1843, devised and encouraged national propaganda promoting Texas annexation, which understated Southern slaveholders' aspirations regarding the future of Texas.{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=677}} Instead, Tyler chose to portray the annexation of Texas as something that would prove economically beneficial to the nation as a whole. The further introduction of slavery into the vast expanses of Texas and beyond, they argued, would \"diffuse\" rather than concentrate slavery regionally, ultimately weakening white attachment and dependence on slave labor. This theory was yoked to the growing enthusiasm among Americans for [[Manifest Destiny]], a desire to see the social, economic and moral precepts of republicanism spread across the continent.{{sfn|May|2008|pp=99\u2013101}}{{sfn|Varon|2008|p=184}} Moreover, Tyler declared that national security was at stake: If foreign powers\u2014Great Britain in particular\u2014were to gain influence in Texas, it would be reduced to a British cotton-producing reserve and a base to exert geostrategic influence over North America. Texas might be coerced into relinquishing slavery, inducing slave uprisings in adjoining slave states and deepening sectional conflicts between American free-soil and slave-soil interests.{{sfn|May|2008|pp=97\u201398}} The appointment of Calhoun, with his southern states' rights reputation\u2014which some believed was \"synonymous with slavery\"\u2014threatened to cast doubt on Tyler's carefully crafted reputation as a nationalist.{{sfn|May|2008|p=110}} Tyler, though ambivalent, felt obliged to enlist Calhoun as Secretary of State, because Tyler's closest confidantes had, in haste, offered the position to the South Carolinian statesman in the immediate aftermath of the ''Princeton'' disaster. Calhoun would be confirmed by Congress by unanimous vote.{{sfn|May|2008|p=109}}\n\nIn advance of Calhoun's arrival in Washington, D.C., Tyler attempted to quickly finalize the treaty negotiations. [[Sam Houston]], President of the Texas Republic, fearing Mexican retaliation, insisted on a tangible demonstration of U.S. commitments to the security of Texas. When key Texas diplomats failed to appear on schedule, the delay compelled Tyler to bring his new Secretary of State directly into negotiations.{{sfn|May|2008|p=110}} Secretary Calhoun was directed to honor former Secretary Upshur's verbal assurances of protection{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=679}} now offered by Calhoun in writing, to provide for U.S. military intervention in the event that Mexico used force to hold Texas. Tyler deployed U.S. Navy vessels to the Gulf of Mexico and ordered army units mobilized, entirely paid for with $100,000 of executive branch contingency funds. The move side-stepped constitutional requirements that Congress authorize appropriations for war.{{sfn|May|2008|p=110}}\n\nOn April 22, 1844, Secretary Calhoun signed the treaty of annexation and ten days later delivered it to the Senate for consideration in secret session.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=679\u2013680}} The details of the treaty negotiations and supporting documents were leaked to the press by Senator [[Benjamin Tappan]] of Ohio. Tappan, a Democrat, was an opponent of annexation and of slavery.{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=680}} The terms of the Tyler\u2013Texas treaty and the release of Calhoun's letter to British ambassador [[Richard Pakenham]] exposed the annexation campaign as a program to expand and preserve slavery. In the Pakenham letter, Calhoun alleged that the institution of slavery contributed to the physical and mental well-being of Southern slaves. The U.S. Senate was compelled to open its debates on ratification to public scrutiny, and hopes for its passage by the two-thirds majority required by the Constitution were abandoned by administration supporters. In linking Texas annexation to the expansion of slavery, Calhoun had alienated many who might previously have supported the treaty.{{sfn|May|2008|p=113}}\n\nOn June 8, 1844, after fierce partisan struggles, the Senate rejected the Tyler\u2013Texas treaty by a vote of 35\u201316, a margin of more than two-to-one.{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=680}} The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1\u201327), while Democrats split, but voted largely in favor (15\u20138).{{sfn|May|2008|pp=114\u2013115}} Nevertheless, the disclosure of the treaty placed the issue of Texas annexation at the center of the 1844 general election.{{sfn|May|2008|p=115}}{{sfn|Varon|2008|p=167}}\n\n===Election of 1844===\n{{main|United States presidential election, 1844}}\nAt the Democratic Convention in Baltimore, Maryland in May 1844, Calhoun's supporters, with Calhoun in attendance, threatened to bolt the proceedings and shift support to Tyler's third party ticket if the delegates failed to produce a pro-Texas nominee.{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=683}} Calhoun's Pakenham letter, and its identification with proslavery extremism, moved the presumptive Democratic Party nominee, the northerner Martin Van Buren, into denouncing annexation. Therefore, Van Buren, already not widely popular in the South, saw his support from that region crippled. As a result, [[James K. Polk]], a pro-Texas Jacksonian and Tennessee politician, won the nomination. Historian [[Daniel Walker Howe]] says that Calhoun's Pakenham letter was a deliberate attempt to influence the outcome of the 1844 election, writing:\n{{quote|By identifying Texas with slavery, Calhoun made sure that Van Buren, being a northerner, would have to oppose Texas. This, Calhoun correctly foresaw, would hurt the New Yorker's chances for the Democratic nomination. Nor did the Carolinian's ingenious strategy ultimately wreck the cause for Texas annexation. Indeed, in that respect it would turn out a brilliant success.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=681\u2013682}}}}\n\nIn the general election, Calhoun offered his endorsement to Polk on condition that he support the annexation of Texas, oppose the [[Tariff of 1842]], and dissolve the ''Washington Globe,'' the semi-official propaganda organ of the Democratic Party headed by [[Francis Preston Blair]]. He received these assurances and enthusiastically supported Polk's candidacy.{{sfn|Merry|2009|pp=104107}} Polk narrowly defeated Henry Clay, who opposed annexation.{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=497; 507}} Lame-duck President Tyler organized a joint House\u2013Senate vote on the Texas treaty which passed, requiring only a simple majority.

The nearly 68-year old Calhoun had suffered periodic bouts of [[tuberculosis]] throughout his life. In March 1850, the disease reached a critical stage.

He warned that the day \"the balance between the two sections\" was destroyed would be a day not far removed from disunion, anarchy, and civil war. Calhoun queried how the Union might be preserved in light of subjugation by the \"stronger\" party against the \"weaker\" one. He maintained that the responsibility of solving the question lay entirely on the North\u2014as the stronger section, to allow the Southern minority an equal share in governance and to cease the agitation. He added:\n{{quote|If you who represent the stronger portion, cannot agree to settle them on the broad principle of justice and duty, say so; and let the States we both represent agree to separate and part in peace.

Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" />\n\n[[File:G.P.A. Healy's portrait of John C. Calhoun, Charleston City Hall IMG 4589.JPG|thumb|[[George Peter Alexander Healy|George Peter Alexander Healy's]] 1851 painting of Calhoun on exhibit at City Hall in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]]|alt=Full profile, black suit with white ruffled shirt. Hand on chest with fingers spread out, soft look.]]\n\nCalhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, helped shape his son's political views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on a commitment to the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing in a world in which slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult.{{sfn|Bartlett|1994| p= 218}} He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key to the success of the American dream.{{sfn|Bartlett|1994| p= 228}}\n\nWhereas other Southern politicians had excused slavery as a \"necessary evil,\" in a famous [[:s:Slavery a Positive Good|speech on the Senate floor]] on February 6, 1837, Calhoun asserted that slavery was a \"positive good.\"<ref name=\"whathesaid\"/> He rooted this claim on two grounds: white supremacy and paternalism. All societies, Calhoun claimed, are ruled by an elite group that enjoys the fruits of the labor of a less-exceptional group. Senator [[William Cabell Rives]] of Virginia earlier had referred to slavery as an evil that might become a \"lesser evil\" in some circumstances. Calhoun believed that conceded too much to the abolitionists:{{sfn|Bartlett|1994|p=227}}\n\n{{quote|quote=I take higher ground. I hold that in the present state of civilization, where two races of different origin, and distinguished by color, and other physical differences, as well as intellectual, are brought together, the relation now existing in the slaveholding States between the two, is, instead of an evil, a good\u2014a positive good&nbsp;... I may say with truth, that in few countries so much is left to the share of the laborer, and so little exacted from him, or where there is more kind attention paid to him in sickness or infirmities of age. Compare his condition with the tenants of the poor houses in the more civilized portions of Europe\u2014look at the sick, and the old and infirm slave, on one hand, in the midst of his family and friends, under the kind superintending care of his master and mistress, and compare it with the forlorn and wretched condition of the pauper in the poorhouse&nbsp;... I hold then, that there never has yet existed a wealthy and civilized society in which one portion of the community did not, in point of fact, live on the labor of the other.{{sfn|Calhoun|1837|p=34}}}}\n\nCalhoun's treatment of his own slaves includes an incident in 1831, when his slave Alick ran away when threatened with a severe whipping. Calhoun wrote to his second cousin and brother-in-law, asking him to keep a lookout for Alick, and if he was taken, to have him \"severely whipped\" and sent back.<ref>Letter to James Edward Calhoun, August 27, 1831, [https://archive.org/details/correspondenceof00calhrich ''Correspondence of John C. Calhoun''], Historical Manuscripts Commission (1899), p. 301.</ref>  When Alick was captured, Calhoun wrote to the captor:\n{{quote|quote=I am glad to hear that Alick has been apprehended and am much obliged to you for paying the expense of apprehending him . . . . He ran away for no other cause, but to avoid a correction for some misconduct, and as I am desirous to prevent a repetition, I wish you to have him lodged in Jail for one week, to be fed on bread and water and to employ some one for me to give him 30 lashes well laid on, at the end of the time. I hope you will pardon the trouble. I only give it, because I deem it necessary to our proper security to prevent the formation of the habit of running away, and I think it better to punish him before his return home than afterwards.<ref>Letter to Armistead Burt of September 1, 1831, [https://archive.org/details/correspondenceof00calhrich ''Correspondence of John C. Calhoun''], Historical Manuscripts Commission (1899), pp. 301-02.</ref>}}\n\nCalhoun rejected the belief of Southern leaders such as Henry Clay that all Americans could agree on the \"opinion and feeling\" that slavery was wrong, although they might disagree on the most practicable way to respond to that great wrong. Calhoun's constitutional ideas acted as a viable conservative alternative to Northern appeals to democracy, majority rule, and natural rights.{{sfn|Ford|1988|pp=405\u2013424}}\n\nAs well as providing the intellectual justification of slavery, Calhoun played a central role in devising the South's overall political strategy. According to Phillips:\n\n{{quote|quote=Organization and strategy were widely demanded in Southern defense, and Calhoun came to be regarded as the main source of plans, arguments, and inspiration. His devices were manifold: to suppress agitation, to praise the slaveholding system; to promote white Southern prosperity and expansion; to procure a Western alliance; to  frame a fresh plan of government by concurrent majorities; to form a Southern  bloc; to warn the North of the dangers of Southern desperation; to appeal for Northern magnanimity as indispensable for the saving of the Union.{{sfn|Phillips|1929|p=416}}}}\n\nShortly after delivering his speech against the Compromise of 1850, Calhoun predicted the destruction of the Union over the slavery issue. Speaking to Senator Mason, he said:\n\n{{quote|I fix its probable occurrence within twelve years or three presidential terms. You and others of your age will probably live to see it; I shall not. The mode by which it will be done is not so clear; it may be brought about in a manner that no one now foresees. But the probability is, it will explode in a presidential election.{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=1}}}}\n\n===Opposition to the War with Mexico===\n[[File:Fort Hill.jpg|thumb|Calhoun's home, [[Fort Hill (Clemson)|Fort Hill]], on the grounds that became part of [[Clemson University]], in [[Clemson, South Carolina]]|alt=Large, classic style white house surrounded by lots of greenery.]]\nCalhoun was consistently opposed to the War with Mexico, arguing that an enlarged military effort would only feed the alarming and growing lust of the public for empire regardless of its constitutional dangers, bloat executive powers and patronage, and saddle the republic with a soaring debt that would disrupt finances and encourage speculation. Calhoun feared, moreover, that Southern slave owners would be shut out of any conquered Mexican territories, as nearly happened with the Wilmot Proviso. He argued that the war would detrimentally lead to the annexation of all of Mexico, which would bring Mexicans into the country, whom he considered deficient in moral and intellectual terms. He said, in a speech on January 4, 1848:\n\n{{quote|style=overflow:inherit;=|quote=We make a great mistake, sir, when we suppose that all people are capable of self-government. We are anxious to force free government on all; and I see that it has been urged in a very respectable quarter, that it is the mission of this country to spread civil and religious liberty over all the world, and especially over this continent. It is a great mistake. None but people advanced to a very high state of moral and intellectual improvement are capable, in a civilized state, of maintaining free government; and amongst those who are so purified, very few, indeed, have had the good fortune of forming a constitution capable of endurance.{{sfn|Calhoun|1999|p=68}}}}\n\nAnti-slavery Northerners denounced the war as a Southern conspiracy to expand slavery; Calhoun in turn perceived a connivance of Yankees to destroy the South. By 1847 he decided the Union was threatened by a totally corrupt [[Second Party System|party system]]. He believed that in their lust for office, patronage and [[spoils system|spoils]], politicians in the North pandered to the anti-slavery vote, especially during presidential campaigns, and politicians in the slave states sacrificed Southern rights in an effort to placate the Northern wings of their parties. Thus, the essential first step in any successful assertion of Southern rights had to be the jettisoning of all party ties. In 1848\u201349, Calhoun tried to give substance to his call for Southern unity. He was the driving force behind the drafting and publication of the \"Address of the Southern Delegates in Congress, to Their Constituents.\"{{sfn|Durham|2008|p=104}} It alleged Northern violations of the constitutional rights of the South, then warned Southern voters to expect forced emancipation of slaves in the near future, followed by their complete subjugation by an unholy alliance of unprincipled Northerners and blacks. Whites would flee and the South would \"become the permanent abode of disorder, anarchy, poverty, misery, and wretchedness.\"{{sfn|Calhoun|1870|p=311}} Only the immediate and unflinching unity of Southern whites could prevent such a disaster. Such unity would either bring the North to its senses or lay the foundation for an independent South. But the spirit of union was still strong in the region and fewer than 40% of the Southern congressmen signed the address, and only one Whig.{{sfn|Bartlett|1994}}\n\nMany Southerners believed his warnings and read every political news story from the North as further evidence of the planned destruction of the white southern way of life. The climax came a decade after Calhoun's death with the election of Republican [[Abraham Lincoln]] in [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]], which led to the secession of South Carolina, followed by six other Southern states. They formed the new [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]], which, in accordance with Calhoun's theory, did not have any organized political parties.{{sfn|Perman|2012|p=11}}\n\n===Concurrent majority===\n[[File:JohnCCalhoun.jpeg|thumb|upright|Undated photograph of Calhoun|alt=Full profile in oval frame, black scarf under quilted sweater, right arm draped over chair arm holding rim of hat. Austere look.]]\nCalhoun's basic concern for protecting the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science\u2014the idea of a [[concurrent majority]] across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority.{{sfn|Ford|1994|pp=19\u201358}} A concurrent majority is a system in which a minority group is permitted to exercise a sort of veto power over actions of a majority that are believed to infringe upon the minority's rights.{{sfn|Cheek|2004|p=146}}\n\nAccording to the principle of a numerical majority, the will of the more numerous citizens should always rule, regardless of the burdens on the minority. Such a principle tends toward a consolidation of power in which the interests of the absolute majority always prevail over those of the minority. Calhoun believed that the great achievement of the American constitution was in checking the tyranny of a numerical majority through institutional procedures that required a concurrent majority, such that each important interest in the community must consent to the actions of government. To secure a concurrent majority, those interests that have a numerical majority must compromise with the interests that are in the minority. A concurrent majority requires a unanimous consent of all the major interests in a community, which is the only sure way of preventing [[tyranny of the majority]]. This idea supported Calhoun's doctrine of interposition or nullification, in which the state governments could refuse to enforce or comply with a policy of the Federal government that threatened the vital interests of the states.<ref>{{cite web |last = Kirk |first = Russell |url = http://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/review/john-c-calhoun-vindicated |title = John C. Calhoun Vindicated |publisher = The Abbeville Institute |date = March 17, 2015 |accessdate = May 18, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Richard Hofstadter]] (1948) emphasizes that Calhoun's conception of ''minority'' was very different from the minorities of a century later:\n\n{{quote|style=overflow:inherit;=|quote=Not in the slightest was [Calhoun] concerned with minority rights as they are chiefly of interest to the modern liberal mind\u2014the rights of dissenters to express unorthodox opinions, of the individual conscience against the State, least of all of ethnic minorities. At bottom he was not interested in any minority that was not a propertied minority. The concurrent majority itself was a device without relevance to the protection of dissent, designed to protect a vested interest of considerable power&nbsp;... it was minority privileges rather than [minority] rights that he really proposed to protect.{{sfn|Hofstadter|2011|pp=90\u201391}}}}\n\nUnlike Jefferson, Calhoun rejected attempts at economic, social, or political leveling, claiming that true equality could not be achieved if all classes were given equal rights and responsibilities. Rather, to ensure true prosperity, it was necessary for a stronger group to provide protection and care for the weaker one. This meant that the two groups should not be equal before the law. For Calhoun, \"protection\" (order) was more important than freedom. Individual rights were something to be earned, not something bestowed by nature or God.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun: He Started the Civil War\" /> Calhoun was concerned with protecting the interests of the Southern States (which he identified with the interests of their slaveholding elites) as a distinct and beleaguered minority among the members of the federal Union; his idea of a concurrent majority as a protection for minority rights has gained some acceptance in American political thought.{{sfn|Baskin|1969|pp=49\u201365}}{{sfn|Kateb |1969 |pp=583\u2013605}} Political scientist Malcolm Jewell argues, \"The decision-making process in this country resembles John Calhoun's 'concurrent majority': A large number of groups both within and outside the government must, in practice, approve any major policy.\"{{sfn|Jewell|2015|p=2}}\n\nCalhoun's ideas on the concurrent majority are illustrated in ''[[A Disquisition on Government]]''. The ''Disquisition'' is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion.{{sfn|Bartlett|1994| pp= 351\u2013355}} It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy.{{sfn|Freehling|1965|pp=25\u201342}}\n\n===State sovereignty and the \"Calhoun Doctrine\"===\nIn the 1840s three interpretations of the constitutional powers of Congress to deal with slavery in territories emerged: the \"free-soil doctrine,\" the \"[[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]] position,\" and the \"Calhoun doctrine.\" The Free Soilers stated that Congress had the power to outlaw slavery in the territories. The popular sovereignty position argued that the voters living there should decide. The Calhoun doctrine said that Congress and the citizens of the territories could never outlaw slavery in the territories.{{sfn|Fehrenbacher|1981|pp= 64\u201365}}\n\nIn what historian Robert R. Russell calls the \"Calhoun Doctrine,\" Calhoun argued that the Federal Government's role in the territories was only that of the trustee or agent of the several sovereign states: it was obliged not to discriminate among the states and hence was incapable of forbidding the bringing into any territory of anything that was legal property in any state. Calhoun argued that citizens from every state had the right to take their property to any territory. Congress and local voters, he asserted, had no authority to place restrictions on slavery in the territories.{{sfn|Russell|1966|pp=466\u2013486}}  In a February 1847 speech before the Senate, Calhoun declared that \"the enacthment of any law which should directly, or by its effects, deprive the citizens of any of the States of this Union from emigrating, with their property, in to any of the territories of the United States, will make such discrimination and would  therefore be a violation of the Constitution.\" Enslavers therefore had a fundamental right to take their property wherever they wished.{{sfn|Baptist|2014|p=331}} As constitutional historian [[Hermann Eduard von Holst|Hermann von Holst]] noted, \"Calhoun's doctrine made it a solemn constitutional duty of the United States government and of the American people to act as if the existence or non-existence of slavery in the Territories did not concern them in the least.\"{{sfn|von Holst|1883|p=312}} The Calhoun Doctrine was opposed by the Free Soil forces, which merged into the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] around 1854.{{sfn|Foner|1995|p= 178}} Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] based his decision in the 1857 Supreme Court case ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]],'' in which he ruled that the federal government could not prohibit slavery in any of the territories, upon Calhoun's arguments. Moderates rejected these beliefs, and Taney's decision became a major point of partisan attack by the Republican Party.{{sfn|Rosen|2007|pp=78\u201379}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Jcctypo01.jpg|thumb|upright|John C.

On his deathbed, Jackson regretted that he had not had Calhoun executed for treason. \"My country,\" he declared, \"would have sustained me in the act, and his fate would have been a warning to traitors in all time to come.\" Even after his death, Calhoun's reputation among Jacksonians remained poor. They disparaged him by portraying him as a man thirsty for power, who when he failed to attain it, sought to tear down his country with him. According to Parton, writing in 1860:\n{{quote|The old Jackson men of the inner set still speak of Mr. Calhoun in terms which show that they consider him at once the most wicked and the most despicable of American statesmen. He was a coward, conspirator, hypocrite, traitor, and fool, say they. He strove, schemed, dreamed, lived only for the presidency; and when he despaired of reaching that office through honorable means, he sought to rise upon the ruins of his country-thinking it better to reign in South Carolina than to serve in the United States. General Jackson lived and died in this opinion.{{sfn|Parton|1860|p=447}}}}\n\nCalhoun is often remembered for his defense of minority rights, in the context of defending white Southern interests from perceived Northern threats, by use of the \"concurrent majority.\" He is also noted and criticized for his strong defense of slavery. These positions played an enormous role in influencing Southern secessionist leaders by strengthening the trend of sectionalism, thus contributing to the Civil War.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun: He Started the Civil War\" /> During his lifetime and after, Calhoun was seen as one of the Senate's most important figures. In 1957, a Senate committee chaired by [[John F. Kennedy]] selected Calhoun as one of the five greatest United States senators in history.<ref name=\"The Famous Five\"/> Biographer Irving Bartlett wrote:\n{{quote|Posterity decided against Calhoun's argument for the indefinite protection of slavery more than 130 years ago.

He is remembered for strongly defending [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and for advancing the concept of minority rights in politics, which he did in the context of protecting the interests of the white [[Southern United States|South]] when it was outnumbered by [[Northern United States|Northerners]]. He began his political career as a nationalist, [[Modernization theory|modernizer]], and proponent of a strong national government and [[protectionism|protective tariffs]]. In the late 1820s, his views changed radically, and he became a leading proponent of [[states' rights]], [[limited government]], [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]], and [[free trade|opposition to high tariffs]]\u2014he saw Northern acceptance of these policies as a condition of the South remaining in the Union. His beliefs and warnings heavily influenced the South's [[Secession in the United States#Confederate States of America|secession from the Union in 1860\u20131861]].\n\nCalhoun began his political career with election to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1810. As a prominent leader of the [[war hawk]] faction, Calhoun strongly supported the [[War of 1812]] to defend American honor against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] infractions of American independence and neutrality during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He then served as [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] under President [[James Monroe]], and in this position reorganized and modernized the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]. Calhoun was a candidate for the presidency in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 election]]. After failing to gain support, he let his name be put forth as a candidate for vice president. The [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] elected Calhoun for vice president by an overwhelming majority. He served under [[John Quincy Adams]] and continued under [[Andrew Jackson]], who defeated Adams in the [[1828 United States presidential election|election of 1828]].\n\nCalhoun had a difficult relationship with Jackson primarily due to the [[Nullification Crisis]] and the [[Petticoat affair]]. In contrast with his previous nationalism, Calhoun vigorously supported South Carolina's right to nullify federal tariff legislation he believed unfairly favored the North, putting him into conflict with unionists such as Jackson. In 1832, with only a few months remaining in his second term, he resigned as vice president and entered the [[United States Senate|Senate]], making him the first former vice president to do so.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} He sought the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] nomination for the presidency in [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]], but lost to surprise nominee [[James K. Polk]], who went on to become president. Calhoun served as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under [[John Tyler]] from 1844 to 1845. As Secretary of State, he supported the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] as a means to extend the [[slave power]], and helped settle the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] with Britain. He then returned to the Senate, where he opposed the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the [[Wilmot Proviso]], and the [[Compromise of 1850]] before his death in 1850. Calhoun often served as a virtual party-independent who variously aligned as needed with Democrats and [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]].\n\nLater in life, Calhoun became known as the \"cast-iron man\" for his rigid defense of white Southern beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Coit|1950|pp=70\u201371}}{{sfn|Miller|1996|pp=115\u2013116}} His concept of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] emphasized approval of slavery and minority rights, as particularly embodied by the Southern states. His concept of minority rights did not extend to slaves; he owned dozens of slaves in [[Fort Hill (Clemson, South Carolina)|Fort Hill]], South Carolina. Calhoun asserted that slavery, rather than being a \"[[necessary evil]],\" was a \"[[Slavery as a positive good|positive good]],\" benefiting both slaves and slave owners.<ref name=\"whathesaid\">{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Clyde N. |url=http://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/clyde-wilson-library/john-c-calhoun-and-slavery-as-a-positive-good-what-he-said |title=John C. Calhoun and Slavery as a 'Positive Good': What He Said |publisher=The Abbeville Institute |date=June 26, 2014 |access-date=June 6, 2016}}</ref> To protect minority rights against majority rule, he called for a [[concurrent majority]] whereby the minority could sometimes block proposals that it felt infringed on their liberties. To this end, Calhoun supported states' rights and nullification, through which states could declare null and void federal laws that they viewed as unconstitutional. Calhoun was one of the \"[[Great Triumvirate]]\" or the \"Immortal Trio\" of [[United States Congress|Congressional]] leaders, along with his Congressional colleagues [[Daniel Webster]] and [[Henry Clay]]. In 1957, a Senate Committee headed by Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] selected Calhoun as one of the five greatest United States Senators of all time.<ref name=\"The Famous Five\">{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/The_Famous_Five.htm |title=The 'Famous Five' |date=March 12, 1959 |publisher=United States Senate |accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Famous_Five_Seven.htm |title=The \"Famous Five\" Now the \"Famous Nine\" | publisher=United States Senate |accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of John C. Calhoun.svg|thumb|upright|Coat of Arms of John C. Calhoun]]\nJohn Caldwell Calhoun was born in [[Abbeville County, South Carolina|Abbeville District, South Carolina]] on March 18, 1782, the fourth child of [[Patrick Calhoun (immigrant)|Patrick Calhoun]] (1727\u20131796) and his wife Martha Caldwell. Patrick's father, also named Patrick Calhoun, had joined the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] immigration movement from [[County Donegal]] to southwestern [[Pennsylvania]]. After the death of the elder Patrick in 1741, the family moved to southwestern [[Virginia]]. Following the defeat of British General [[Edward Braddock]] at the [[Battle of the Monongahela]] in 1755, the family, fearing Indian attacks, moved to South Carolina in 1756.{{sfn|Coit |1950|p=3}}{{sfn|Niven|1988|pp=6\u20138}} Patrick Calhoun belonged to the Calhoun clan in the tight-knit Scotch-Irish community on the Southern frontier. He was known as an [[American Indian Wars|Indian fighter]] and an ambitious surveyor, farmer, planter and politician, being a member of the [[South Carolina General Assembly|South Carolina Legislature]]. As a Presbyterian, he stood opposed to the Anglican elite based in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. He was a Patriot in the [[American Revolution]], and opposed [[History of the United States Constitution#Ratification of the Constitution|ratification of the federal Constitution]] on grounds of states' rights and personal liberties. Calhoun would eventually adopt his father's states' rights beliefs.{{sfn|Wiltse|1944|pp=15\u201324}}{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=10}}\n\nYoung Calhoun showed scholastic talent, and although schools were scarce on the Carolina frontier, he was enrolled briefly in an academy in [[Appling, Georgia]], which soon closed. He continued his studies privately. When his father died, his brothers were away starting business careers, and so the 14-year-old Calhoun took over management of the family farm and five other farms. For four years he simultaneously kept up his reading and his hunting and fishing. The family decided he should continue his education, and so he resumed studies at the Academy after it reopened.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\">{{cite web |url= https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_John_Calhoun.htm |title= John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832) |publisher= United States Senate |access-date= May 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith financing from his brothers, he went to [[Yale University|Yale College]] in Connecticut in 1802. For the first time in his life, Calhoun encountered serious, advanced, well-organized intellectual dialogue that could shape his mind. Yale was dominated by President [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], a [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] who became his mentor. Dwight's brilliance entranced (and sometimes repelled) Calhoun. Biographer John Niven says:\n\n{{quote|quote=Calhoun admired Dwight's extemporaneous sermons, his seemingly encyclopedic knowledge, and his awesome mastery of the classics, of the tenets of [[Calvinism]], and of [[metaphysics]]. No one, he thought, could explicate the language of [[John Locke]] with such clarity.{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=18}}}}\n\nDwight repeatedly denounced [[Jeffersonian democracy]], and Calhoun challenged him in class. Dwight could not shake Calhoun's commitment to republicanism. \"Young man,\" retorted Dwight, \"your talents are of a high order and might justify you for any station, but I deeply regret that you do not love sound principles better than [[Sophist#Modern usage|sophistry]]\u2014you seem to possess a most unfortunate bias for error.\"{{sfn|Capers|1960|pp=1\u20132}} Dwight also expounded on the strategy of secession from the Union as a legitimate solution for [[New England]]'s disagreements with the national government.{{sfn|Calhoun|Post|1995|p=xii}}{{sfn|Douglas|2009|p= 368}}\n\nCalhoun made friends easily, read widely, and was a noted member of the debating society of [[Brothers in Unity]].

He was raised Calvinist but was attracted to Southern varieties of [[Unitarianism]] of the sort that attracted Jefferson.

He immediately became a leader of the [[War Hawk]]s, along with Speaker [[Henry Clay]] of Kentucky and South Carolina congressmen [[William Lowndes (congressman)|William Lowndes]] and [[Langdon Cheves]]. Brushing aside the vehement objections of both anti-war New Englanders and arch-conservative [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonians]] led by [[John Randolph of Roanoke]], they demanded war against Britain to preserve American honor and republican values, which had been violated by the British refusal to recognize American shipping rights.<ref name=\"John C.

Drawing on the linguistic tradition of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], Calhoun's committee called for a declaration of war in ringing phrases, denouncing Britain's \"lust for power\", \"unbounded tyranny\", and \"mad ambition\".<ref>\"War Report of 1812,\" ''Papers of John C.

The opening phase involved multiple disasters for American arms, as well as a financial crisis when the Treasury could barely pay the bills. The conflict caused economic hardship for the Americans, as the [[Royal Navy]] blockaded the ports and cut off imports, exports and the coastal trade. Several attempted invasions of [[Canada]] were fiascos, but the U.S. in 1813 seized control of [[Southwestern Ontario|Lake Erie]] and broke the power of hostile Indians in battles such as the [[Battle of the Thames]] in Canada in 1813 and the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] in Alabama in 1814. These Indians had, in many cases, cooperated with the British or [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in opposing American interests.{{sfn|Stagg|2012|pp=117, 161}}\n\nCalhoun labored to raise troops, provide funds, speed logistics, rescue the currency, and regulate commerce to aid the war effort. One colleague hailed him as \"the young Hercules who carried the war on his shoulders.\"<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" /> Disasters on the battlefield made him double his legislative efforts to overcome the obstructionism of John Randolph, [[Daniel Webster]], and other opponents of the war. In December 1814, with the armies of [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] apparently defeated, and the British [[Battle of Plattsburgh|invasions of New York]] and [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]] thwarted, British and American diplomats signed the [[Treaty of Ghent]]. It called for a return to the borders of 1812 with no gains or losses. Before the treaty reached the Senate for ratification, and even before news of its signing reached New Orleans, a massive British invasion force was utterly defeated in January 1815 at the [[Battle of New Orleans]], making a national hero of General [[Andrew Jackson]]. Americans celebrated what they called a \"second war of independence\" against Britain. This led to the beginning of the \"[[Era of Good Feelings]]\", an era marked by the formal demise of the Federalist Party and increased nationalism.{{sfn|Langguth|2006|pp=375, 387}}\n\n===Postwar planning===\nDespite American successes, the mismanagement of the Army during the war distressed Calhoun, and he resolved to strengthen and centralize the War Department.{{sfn|Wiltse|1944|pp=103\u2013105}} The militia had proven itself quite unreliable during the war and Calhoun saw the need for a permanent and professional military force. In 1816 he called for building an effective navy, including steam frigates, as well as a standing army of adequate size. The British blockade of the coast had underscored the necessity of rapid means of internal transportation; Calhoun proposed a system of \"great permanent roads\". The blockade had cut off the import of manufactured items, so he emphasized the need to encourage more domestic manufacture, fully realizing that industry was based in the Northeast. The dependence of the old financial system on import duties was devastated when the blockade cut off imports. Calhoun called for a system of internal taxation that would not collapse from a war-time shrinkage of maritime trade, as the tariffs had done. The expiration of the charter of the [[First Bank of the United States]] had also distressed the Treasury, so to reinvigorate and modernize the economy Calhoun called for a new national bank. A new bank was chartered as the [[Second Bank of the United States]] by Congress and approved by President [[James Madison]] in 1816. Through his proposals, Calhoun emphasized a national footing and downplayed sectionalism and states rights. Historian [[Ulrich Bonnell Phillips|Ulrich B. Phillips]] says that at this stage of Calhoun's career, \"The word ''nation'' was often on his lips, and his conviction was to enhance national unity which he identified with national power.\"{{sfn|Phillips|1929|loc=3:412\u2013414}}\n\n===Rhetorical style===\nRegarding his career in the House of Representatives, an observer commented that Calhoun was \"the most elegant speaker that sits in the House&nbsp;... His gestures are easy and graceful, his manner forcible, and language elegant; but above all, he confines himself closely to the subject, which he always understands, and enlightens everyone within hearing.\"{{sfn|Jewett|1908|p=143}}\n\nHis talent for public speaking required systematic self-discipline and practice. A later critic noted the sharp contrast between his hesitant conversations and his fluent speaking styles, adding that Calhoun \"had so carefully cultivated his naturally poor voice as to make his utterance clear, full, and distinct in speaking and while not at all musical it yet fell pleasantly on the ear\".{{sfn|Meigs|1917|loc=Vol. 1, p. 221}} Calhoun was \"a high-strung man of ultra intellectual cast\".{{sfn|Meigs|1917|loc=Vol. 2, p. 8}} As such, Calhoun was not known for charisma. He was often seen as harsh and aggressive with other representatives.{{sfn|Peterson|1988| pp= 280, 408}}{{sfn|Hofstadter|2011|p=96}} But he was a brilliant intellectual orator and strong organizer. Historian [[Russell Kirk]] says, \"That zeal which flared like Greek fire in Randolph burned in Calhoun, too; but it was contained in the Cast-iron Man as in a furnace, and Calhoun's passion glowed out only through his eyes. No man was more stately, more reserved.\"{{sfn|Kirk|2001|p=168}}\n\nJohn Quincy Adams concluded in 1821 that \"Calhoun is a man of fair and candid mind, of honorable principles, of clear and quick understanding, of cool self-possession, of enlarged philosophical views, and of ardent patriotism. He is above all sectional and factious prejudices more than any other statesman of this Union with whom I have ever acted.\"{{sfn|von Holst|1883|p=54}} Historian Charles Wiltse noted Calhoun's evolution, \"Though he is known today primarily for his sectionalism, Calhoun was the last of the great political leaders of his time to take a sectional position\u2014later than Daniel Webster, later than Henry Clay, later than Adams himself.\"{{sfn|Wiltse|1944|p=234}}\n\n==Secretary of War and postwar nationalism==\n[[File:JCCalhoun-1822.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1822 portrait of Calhoun at the age of 40|alt=oil painting, 3/4 left side profile, with tied white bow tie scarf and dark blazer with gold buttons.

Calhoun took office on December 8 and served until 1825.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" /> He continued his role as a leading nationalist during the Era of Good Feelings. He proposed an elaborate program of national reforms to the infrastructure that he believed would speed economic modernization. His first priority was an effective navy, including steam frigates, and in the second place a standing army of adequate size\u2014and as further preparation for emergency, \"great permanent roads\", \"a certain encouragement\" to manufactures, and a system of internal taxation that would not collapse from a war-time shrinkage of maritime trade, like customs duties.{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=54}}\n\nA reform-minded modernizer, Calhoun attempted to institute centralization and efficiency in the Indian Department and in the Army by establishing new coastal and frontier fortifications and building military roads, but Congress either failed to respond to his reforms or responded with hostility. Calhoun's frustration with congressional inaction, political rivalries, and ideological differences spurred him to create the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] in 1824.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" />{{sfn|Belko|2004|pp=170\u2013197}} The responsibilities of the bureau were to manage treaty negotiations, schools, and trade with Indians, in addition to handling all expenditures and correspondence concerning Indian affairs.

He promoted a plan, adopted by Monroe in 1825, to preserve the sovereignty of eastern Indians by [[Indian removal|relocating]] them to western reservations they could control without interference from state governments.{{sfn|Satz|1974|pp=2\u20137}} In over seven years Calhoun supervised the negotiation and ratification of 40 treaties with Indian tribes.{{sfn|Prucha|1997|p=155}} Calhoun opposed the invasion of [[Spanish Florida]] launched in 1818 by General Jackson during the [[First Seminole War]], which was done without direct authorization from Calhoun or President Monroe, and in private with other cabinet members, advocated censuing of Jackson as punishment. Calhoun claimed that Jackson had begun a war against Spain in violation of the Constitution and, falsely, that he had contradicted Calhoun's explicit orders in doing so. No official instructions not to invade Florida or attack the Spanish were ever issued by the administration.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=366}} However, Calhoun supported the [[Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident|execution of Alexander Arbuthnot and Robert Ambrister]], two British soldiers living in Florida who were accused of inciting the Seminole to make war against the United States. Calhoun accused the British of being involved in \"wickedness, corruption, and barbarity at which the heart sickens and which in this enlightened age it ought not scarcely to be believed that a christian nation would have participated.\" He added that he hoped the executions of Arbuthnot and Ambrister would deter the British and any other nations \"who by false promises delude and excite an Indian tribe to all the deeds of savage war.\"{{sfn|Remini|1977|pp=358\u2013359}} The United States annexed Florida from Spain in 1819 through the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]].<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" />\n\nCalhoun's tenure as Secretary of War witnessed the outbreak of the [[Missouri Compromise|Missouri crisis]] in December 1818, when a petition arrived from Missouri settlers seeking admission into the Union as a slave state. In response, Representative [[James Tallmadge Jr.]] of New York proposed two amendments to the bill designed to restrict the spread of slavery into what would become the new state. This amendments touched off an intense debate between North and South that had some talking openly of disunion. In February 1820, Calhoun predicted to Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]], a New Englander, that the Missouri issue \"would not produce a dissolution\" of the Union. \"But if it should,\" Calhoun went on, \"the South would of necessity be compelled to form an alliance with...Great Britain.\" \"I said that would be returning to the colonial state,\" Adams recalled saying afterwards. According to Adams, \"He said, yes, pretty much, but it would be forced upon them.\"{{sfn|Baptist|2014|pp=154\u2013156}}\n\nAfter the war ended in 1815 the \"[[Old Republicans]]\" in Congress, with their Jeffersonian ideology for economy in the federal government, sought to reduce the operations and finances of the War Department. Calhoun's political rivalry with [[William H. Crawford]], the Secretary of the Treasury, over the pursuit of the presidency in the 1824 election, complicated Calhoun's tenure as War Secretary. The general lack of military action following the war meant that a large army, such as that preferred by Calhoun, was no longer considered necessary. The \"Radicals\", a group of strong states' rights supporters who mostly favored Crawford for president in the coming election, were inherently suspicious of large armies. Some allegedly also wanted to hinder Calhoun's own presidential aspirations for that election.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" /> Thus, on March 2, 1821, Congress passed the Reduction Act, which reduced the number of enlisted men of the army by half, from 11,709 to 5,586, and the number of the officer corps by a fifth, from 680 to 540. Calhoun, though concerned, offered little protest. Later, to provide the army with a more organized command structure, which had been severely lacking during the War of 1812, he appointed Major General [[Jacob Brown]] to a position that would later become known as \"[[Commanding General of the United States Army]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/amh-v1/ch07.htm |title=7: Toward a Professional Army |publisher=United States Army |access-date=August 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Vice Presidency==\n===1824 and 1828 elections and Adams presidency===\n[[File:Fort Hill (Clemson, SC) Historic Marker.JPG|thumb|upright|State historic marker at [[Fort Hill (Clemson, South Carolina)|Fort Hill]], Calhoun's home from 1825 until his death in 1850|alt=Large cast embossed concrete or metal panel atop a metal post.

Calhoun also expressed some concerns, which caused friction between him and Adams.<ref name=\"Roesch, James Rutledge\">{{cite web |url= http://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/review/john-c-calhoun-and-states-rights/ |author= Roesch, James Rutledge. |date= August 25, 2015 |title= John C.

Calhoun became disillusioned with Adams' high tariff policies and increased centralization of government through a network of \"internal improvements\", which he now saw as a threat to the rights of the states. Calhoun wrote to Jackson on June 4, 1826, informing him that he would support Jackson's second campaign for the presidency in [[1828 United States presidential election|1828]]. The two were never particularly close friends. Calhoun never fully trusted Jackson, a frontiersman and popular war hero, but hoped that his election would bring some reprieve from Adams's anti-states' rights policies.<ref name=\"John C.

Hamilton spoke about this prospect with Governor [[John Forsyth (Georgia)|John Forsyth]] of Georgia, who acted as a mediator between the Jackson campaign and Crawford. Forsyth wrote a letter back to Hamilton in which he claimed that Crawford had stated to him that it was Calhoun, not Crawford, who had supported censuring Jackson for his invasion of Florida. Knowing that the letter could destroy the partnership between Jackson and Calhoun, Hamilton and fellow-Jackson aide [[William Berkeley Lewis|William B.

They alleged that John and Peggy Eaton had engaged in an adulterous affair while she was still legally married to her first husband, and that her recent behavior was unladylike. The allegations of scandal created an intolerable situation for Jackson. The Petticoat affair ended friendly relations between Calhoun and Jackson.{{sfn|Marszalek|2000|p=84}}\n\nJackson sided with the Eatons. He and his late wife [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel Donelson]] had undergone similar political attacks stemming from their marriage in 1791. The two had married in 1791 not knowing that Rachel's first husband, Lewis Robards, had failed to finalize the expected divorce. Once the divorce was finalized, they married legally in 1794, but the episode caused a major controversy, and was used against him in the 1828 campaign. Jackson saw attacks on Eaton stemming ultimately from the political opposition of Calhoun, who had failed to silence his wife's criticisms. The Calhouns were widely regarded as the chief instigators.<ref name=\"Floride Bonneau Colhoun Calhoun\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehermitage.com/learn/andrew-jackson/family/rachel/ |title=Rachel Jackson |publisher=The Hermitage |access-date=August 17, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817072639/http://thehermitage.com/learn/andrew-jackson/family/rachel/ |archivedate=August 17, 2016 }}</ref> Jackson, who loved to personalize disputes,{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=14\u201315}} also saw the Petticoat affair as a direct challenge to his authority, because it involved lower-ranking executive officials and their wives seeming to contest his ability to choose whomever he wanted for his cabinet.{{sfn|Bates|2015|p=315}} Secretary of State [[Martin Van Buren]], a widower, took Jackson's side and defended the Eatons.{{sfn|McKellar|1942|p=151}} Van Buren was a northerner and a supporter of the 1828 tariff (which Calhoun bitterly opposed). Calhoun and Van Buren were the main contenders for the vice presidential nomination in the ensuing election, and the nominee would then presumably be the party's choice to succeed Jackson.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=243}} That Van Buren sided with the Eatons, in addition to disagreements between Jackson and Calhoun on other issues, mainly the [[Nullification Crisis]], marked him as Calhoun's likely vice presidential successor.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=337\u2013339}}\n\nSome historians, including Jackson biographers Richard B. Latner and [[Robert V. Remini]], believe that the hostility towards the Eatons was rooted less in questions of proper behavior than in politics. Eaton had been in favor of the Tariff of Abominations. He was also politically close to Van Buren. Calhoun may have wanted to expel Eaton from the cabinet as a way of boosting his anti-tariff agenda and increasing his standing in the Democratic Party. Many cabinet members were Southern and could be expected to sympathize with such concerns, especially Treasury Secretary [[Samuel D. Ingham]], who was allied with Calhoun and believed that he, not Van Buren, should succeed Jackson as president.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=243}}\n\nIn 1830, reports had emerged accurately stating that Calhoun, as Secretary of War, had favored censuring Jackson for his 1818 invasion of Florida. These infuriated Jackson.{{sfn|Cheathem|2008|p=29}} Eventually, Lewis decided to reveal the existence of Forsyth's letter, and on April 30, Crawford wrote a second letter, this time to Forsyth, repeating the charge Forsyth represented him as having previously made. Jackson received the letter on May 12, which confirmed his suspicions. He claimed that Calhoun had \"betrayed\" him.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=242\u2013243}} Eaton took his revenge on Calhoun. For reasons unclear, Calhoun asked Eaton to approach Jackson about the possibility of Calhoun publishing his correspondence with Jackson at the time of the Seminole War. Eaton did nothing, leading Calhoun to believe that Jackson had approved the publication of the letters.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=306\u2013307}} Calhoun published them in the ''United States Telegraph,'' a newspaper edited by a Calhoun prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Duff Green]].<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\"/> This gave the appearance of Calhoun trying to justify himself against a conspiracy to damage him, and further enraged the President.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=306\u2013307}}\n\nFinally in the spring of 1831, at the suggestion of Van Buren, who, like Jackson, supported the Eatons, Jackson replaced all but one of his Cabinet members, thereby limiting Calhoun's influence. Van Buren began the process by resigning as Secretary of State, facilitating Jackson's removal of others. Van Buren thereby grew in favor with Jackson, while the rift between the President and Calhoun was widened.{{sfn|Marszalek|2000|p=121}} Later, in 1832, Calhoun, as vice president, cast a tie-breaking vote against Jackson's nomination of Van Buren as [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Minister to Great Britain]] in a failed attempt to end Van Buren's political career. Missouri Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]], a staunch supporter of Jackson, then stated that Calhoun had \"elected a Vice President\", as Van Buren was able to move past his failed nomination as Minister to Great Britain and instead gain the Democratic Party's vice presidential nomination in the [[1832 United States presidential election|1832 election]], in which he and Jackson were victorious.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" />\n\n===Nullification===\n{{See also|Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|Nullification Crisis}}\nCalhoun had begun to oppose increases in protective tariffs, as they generally benefited Northerners more than Southerners. While he was Vice President in the Adams administration, Jackson's supporters devised a high tariff legislation that placed duties on imports that were also made in New England. Calhoun had been assured that the northeastern interests would reject the [[Tariff of Abominations|Tariff of 1828]], exposing pro-Adams New England congressmen to charges that they selfishly opposed legislation popular among [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian Democrats]] in the west and mid-Atlantic States. The southern legislators miscalculated and the so-called \"Tariff of Abominations\" passed and was signed into law by President Adams. Frustrated, Calhoun returned to his South Carolina plantation, where he anonymously composed ''[[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]]'', an essay rejecting the centralization philosophy and supporting the principle of nullification as a means to prevent tyranny of a central government.{{sfn|Niven|1988|pp=158\u2013161}}\n\nCalhoun supported the idea of nullification through a [[concurrent majority]]. Nullification is a legal theory that a state has the right to nullify, or invalidate, any federal law it deems unconstitutional. In Calhoun's words, it is \"the right of a State to interpose, in the last resort, in order to arrest an unconstitutional act of the General Government, within its limits.\"{{sfn|Crall\u00e9|1888|p=96}} Nullification can be traced back to arguments by Jefferson and Madison in writing the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]] of 1798 against the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]]. Madison expressed the hope that the states would declare the acts unconstitutional, while Jefferson explicitly endorsed nullification.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/primary-source-documents/virginia-and-kentucky-resolutions/ |title = Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions (1798) |publisher = Bill of Rights Institute |access-date = January 6, 2016 }}</ref> Calhoun openly argued for a state's right to secede from the Union, as a last resort to protect its liberty and sovereignty. In his later years, Madison rebuked supporters of nullification, stating that no state had the right to nullify federal law.{{sfn|Rutland|1997|pp=248\u2013249}}\n\nIn \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest\", Calhoun argued that a state could veto any federal law that went beyond the enumerated powers and encroached upon the residual powers of the State.{{sfn|Calhoun|1992|pp=348\u2013349}} President Jackson, meanwhile, generally supported states' rights, but opposed nullification and secession. At the 1830 [[Jefferson\u2013Jackson Day|Jefferson Day]] dinner at Jesse Brown's Indian Queen Hotel, Jackson proposed a toast and proclaimed, \"Our federal Union, it must be preserved.\"{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=173}} Calhoun replied, \"The Union, next to our liberty, the most dear. May we all remember that it can only be preserved by respecting the rights of the states, and distributing equally the benefit and burden of the Union.\"{{sfn|Brands|2005|p=446}} Calhoun's publication of letters from the Seminole War in the ''Telegraph'' caused his relationship with Jackson to deteriorate further, thus contributing to the Nullification crisis. Jackson and Calhoun began an angry correspondence that lasted until Jackson stopped it in July.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" />\n\nOn July 14, 1832, Jackson signed into law the [[Tariff of 1832]]. It was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates, but the nullifiers in South Carolina remained unsatisfied. On November 24, the South Carolina legislature officially nullified both the Tariff of 1832 and the Tariff of 1828, to be null and void as of February 1, 1833.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/24c.asp |title=The South Carolina Nullification Controversy |website= U.S. History.org |access-date=August 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/ordnull.asp |title=South Carolina Ordinance of Nullification, November 24, 1832 |publisher=Yale Law School |access-date=August 22, 2016}}</ref> In response, Jackson sent [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] warships to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] harbor, and threatened to hang Calhoun or any man who worked to support nullification or secession.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=405\u2013406}} After joining the Senate, Calhoun began to work with Clay on a new [[Tariff of 1833|compromise tariff]]. A bill sponsored by the administration had been introduced by Representative [[Gulian C. Verplanck]] of New York, but it lowered rates more sharply than Clay and other protectionists desired. Clay managed to get Calhoun to agree to a bill with higher rates in exchange for Clay's opposition to Jackson's military threats and, perhaps, with the hope that he could win some Southern votes in his next bid for the presidency.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=38}} On the same day, Congress passed the [[Force Bill]], which empowered the President of the United States to use military force to ensure state compliance with federal law. South Carolina accepted the tariff, but in a final show of defiance, nullified the Force Bill.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=406\u2013410}} In Calhoun's speech against the Force Bill, delivered on February 5, 1833, no longer as vice president, he strongly endorsed nullification, at one point saying:\n{{quote|Why, then, confer on the President the extensive and unlimited powers provided in this bill? Why authorize him to use military force to arrest the civil process of the State? But one answer can be given: That, in a contest between the State and the General Government, if the resistance be limited on both sides to the civil process, the State, by its inherent sovereignty, standing upon its reserved powers, will prove too powerful in such a controversy, and must triumph over the Federal Government, sustained by its delegated and limited authority; and in this answer we have an acknowledgment of the truth of those great principles for which the State has so firmly and nobly contended.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umsl.edu/virtualstl/phase2/1850/events/perspectives/documents/calhoun01.html |title=John C Calhoun: Against the Force Bill |last= Calhoun |first= John C. |publisher=University of Missouri |access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nIn his three-volume biography of Jackson, [[James Parton]] summed up Calhoun's role in the Nullification crisis: \"Calhoun began it.

Hayne]] was considered less capable than Calhoun to represent South Carolina in the Senate debates, so in late 1832 Hayne resigned to become governor; the South Carolina legislature elected Calhoun as his replacement. On December 28, Calhoun resigned as vice president to become a senator, with a voice in the debates. Van Buren had already been elected as Jackson's new vice president, meaning that Calhoun had less than three months left on his term anyway.{{sfn|Phillips|1929|pp=411\u2013419}} The South Carolina newspaper ''City Gazette'' commented on the change:\n{{quote|It is admitted that the former gentleman [Hayne] is injudiciously pitted against Clay and Webster and, nullification out of the question, Mr. Calhoun's place should be in front with these formidable politicians.{{sfn|Jervey|1909|p=315}}}}\n\nBiographer John Niven argues \"that these moves were part of a well-thought-out plan whereby Hayne would restrain the hotheads in the state legislature and Calhoun would defend his brainchild, nullification, in Washington against administration stalwarts and the likes of Daniel Webster, the new apostle of northern nationalism.\"{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=192}} Calhoun was the first of two vice presidents to resign, the second being [[Spiro Agnew]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/calhoun-resigns-vice-presidency |title = Calhoun resigns vice presidency |publisher = A&E Television |accessdate = December 26, 2011 }}</ref> During his terms as vice president, he made a record of 31 [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by vice presidents of the United States|tie-breaking votes in the Senate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/VPTies.pdf|title=Senate.gov: VPTies.pdf|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==First term in the U.S. Senate==\n[[File:John C.

Calhoun sometimes affiliated with the Whigs, but chose to remain a virtual independent due to the Whig promotion of federally subsidized \"internal improvements.\"{{sfn|Ashworth|1995|p=203}}\n\nFrom 1833 to 1834, Jackson was engaged in removing federal funds from the [[Second Bank of the United States]] during the [[Bank War]]. Calhoun opposed this action, considering it a dangerous expansion of executive power.{{sfn|Wilentz|2006|p=397}} He called the men of the Jackson administration \"artful, cunning, and corrupt politicians, and not fearless warriors.\" He accused Jackson of being ignorant on financial matters. As evidence, he cited the economic panic caused by [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]] as a means to stop Jackson from destroying the Bank.{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=42}} On March 28, 1834, Calhoun voted with the Whig senators on a successful motion to [[censure]] Jackson for his removal of the funds.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Reverses_A_Presidential_Censure.htm |title=Senate Reverses a Presidential Censure |publisher=United States Senate |access-date=August 20, 2017}}</ref> In 1837, he refused to attend the inauguration of Jackson's chosen successor, Van Buren, even as other powerful senators who opposed the administration, such as Webster and Clay, did witness the inauguration.{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=422}} However, by 1837 Calhoun generally had realigned himself with most of the Democrats' policies.{{sfn|Ashworth|1995|p=203}}\n\nTo restore his national stature, Calhoun cooperated with Van Buren. Democrats were hostile to national banks, and the country's bankers had joined the Whig Party. The Democratic replacement, meant to help combat the [[Panic of 1837]], was the [[Independent Treasury]] system, which Calhoun supported and which went into effect.{{sfn|Niven|1988|pp=62\u201363}} Calhoun, like Jackson and Van Buren, attacked finance capitalism and opposed what he saw as encroachment by government and big business.

Calhoun, U.S. Secretary of State.jpg|thumb|upright|Calhoun, during his tenure as Secretary of State (April 1844 \u2013 March 1845)]]\nUpshur's loss was a severe blow to the Tyler administration. When Calhoun was nominated as Upshur's replacement, the White House was well-advanced towards securing a treaty of annexation with Texas. The State Department's secret negotiations with the Texas republic had proceeded despite explicit threats from a suspicious Mexican government that an unauthorized seizure of its northern district of [[Coahuila y Tejas]] would be equivalent to an act of war.{{sfn|May|2008|p=105}} Both the negotiations with Texas envoys and the garnering of support from the U.S. Senate had been spearheaded aggressively by Secretary Upshur, a strong pro-slavery partisan.{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=677}} Tyler looked to its ratification by the Senate as the ''sine qua non'' to his ambition for another term in office. Tyler \"planned to outflank the Whigs by gaining support from the Democratic Party or possibly creating a new party of [discontented] Northern Democrats and Southern Whigs.\"{{sfn|May|2008|p=100}}\n\nCalhoun, though as avid a proponent for Texas acquisition as Upshur, posed a political liability to Tyler's aims.{{sfn|Holt|2004|p=35}} As secretary of state, Calhoun's political objective was to see that the presidency was placed in the hands of a southern [[Fire-Eaters|extremist]], who would put the expansion of slavery at the center of national policy.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=680\u2013681}}\n\nTyler and his allies had, since 1843, devised and encouraged national propaganda promoting Texas annexation, which understated Southern slaveholders' aspirations regarding the future of Texas.{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=677}} Instead, Tyler chose to portray the annexation of Texas as something that would prove economically beneficial to the nation as a whole. The further introduction of slavery into the vast expanses of Texas and beyond, they argued, would \"diffuse\" rather than concentrate slavery regionally, ultimately weakening white attachment and dependence on slave labor. This theory was yoked to the growing enthusiasm among Americans for [[Manifest Destiny]], a desire to see the social, economic and moral precepts of republicanism spread across the continent.{{sfn|May|2008|pp=99\u2013101}}{{sfn|Varon|2008|p=184}} Moreover, Tyler declared that national security was at stake: If foreign powers\u2014Great Britain in particular\u2014were to gain influence in Texas, it would be reduced to a British cotton-producing reserve and a base to exert geostrategic influence over North America. Texas might be coerced into relinquishing slavery, inducing slave uprisings in adjoining slave states and deepening sectional conflicts between American free-soil and slave-soil interests.{{sfn|May|2008|pp=97\u201398}} The appointment of Calhoun, with his southern states' rights reputation\u2014which some believed was \"synonymous with slavery\"\u2014threatened to cast doubt on Tyler's carefully crafted reputation as a nationalist.{{sfn|May|2008|p=110}} Tyler, though ambivalent, felt obliged to enlist Calhoun as Secretary of State, because Tyler's closest confidantes had, in haste, offered the position to the South Carolinian statesman in the immediate aftermath of the ''Princeton'' disaster. Calhoun would be confirmed by Congress by unanimous vote.{{sfn|May|2008|p=109}}\n\nIn advance of Calhoun's arrival in Washington, D.C., Tyler attempted to quickly finalize the treaty negotiations. [[Sam Houston]], President of the Texas Republic, fearing Mexican retaliation, insisted on a tangible demonstration of U.S. commitments to the security of Texas. When key Texas diplomats failed to appear on schedule, the delay compelled Tyler to bring his new Secretary of State directly into negotiations.{{sfn|May|2008|p=110}} Secretary Calhoun was directed to honor former Secretary Upshur's verbal assurances of protection{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=679}} now offered by Calhoun in writing, to provide for U.S. military intervention in the event that Mexico used force to hold Texas. Tyler deployed U.S. Navy vessels to the Gulf of Mexico and ordered army units mobilized, entirely paid for with $100,000 of executive branch contingency funds. The move side-stepped constitutional requirements that Congress authorize appropriations for war.{{sfn|May|2008|p=110}}\n\nOn April 22, 1844, Secretary Calhoun signed the treaty of annexation and ten days later delivered it to the Senate for consideration in secret session.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=679\u2013680}} The details of the treaty negotiations and supporting documents were leaked to the press by Senator [[Benjamin Tappan]] of Ohio. Tappan, a Democrat, was an opponent of annexation and of slavery.{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=680}} The terms of the Tyler\u2013Texas treaty and the release of Calhoun's letter to British ambassador [[Richard Pakenham]] exposed the annexation campaign as a program to expand and preserve slavery. In the Pakenham letter, Calhoun alleged that the institution of slavery contributed to the physical and mental well-being of Southern slaves. The U.S. Senate was compelled to open its debates on ratification to public scrutiny, and hopes for its passage by the two-thirds majority required by the Constitution were abandoned by administration supporters. In linking Texas annexation to the expansion of slavery, Calhoun had alienated many who might previously have supported the treaty.{{sfn|May|2008|p=113}}\n\nOn June 8, 1844, after fierce partisan struggles, the Senate rejected the Tyler\u2013Texas treaty by a vote of 35\u201316, a margin of more than two-to-one.{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=680}} The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1\u201327), while Democrats split, but voted largely in favor (15\u20138).{{sfn|May|2008|pp=114\u2013115}} Nevertheless, the disclosure of the treaty placed the issue of Texas annexation at the center of the 1844 general election.{{sfn|May|2008|p=115}}{{sfn|Varon|2008|p=167}}\n\n===Election of 1844===\n{{main|United States presidential election, 1844}}\nAt the Democratic Convention in Baltimore, Maryland in May 1844, Calhoun's supporters, with Calhoun in attendance, threatened to bolt the proceedings and shift support to Tyler's third party ticket if the delegates failed to produce a pro-Texas nominee.{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=683}} Calhoun's Pakenham letter, and its identification with proslavery extremism, moved the presumptive Democratic Party nominee, the northerner Martin Van Buren, into denouncing annexation. Therefore, Van Buren, already not widely popular in the South, saw his support from that region crippled. As a result, [[James K. Polk]], a pro-Texas Jacksonian and Tennessee politician, won the nomination. Historian [[Daniel Walker Howe]] says that Calhoun's Pakenham letter was a deliberate attempt to influence the outcome of the 1844 election, writing:\n{{quote|By identifying Texas with slavery, Calhoun made sure that Van Buren, being a northerner, would have to oppose Texas. This, Calhoun correctly foresaw, would hurt the New Yorker's chances for the Democratic nomination. Nor did the Carolinian's ingenious strategy ultimately wreck the cause for Texas annexation. Indeed, in that respect it would turn out a brilliant success.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=681\u2013682}}}}\n\nIn the general election, Calhoun offered his endorsement to Polk on condition that he support the annexation of Texas, oppose the [[Tariff of 1842]], and dissolve the ''Washington Globe,'' the semi-official propaganda organ of the Democratic Party headed by [[Francis Preston Blair]]. He received these assurances and enthusiastically supported Polk's candidacy.{{sfn|Merry|2009|pp=104107}} Polk narrowly defeated Henry Clay, who opposed annexation.{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=497; 507}} Lame-duck President Tyler organized a joint House\u2013Senate vote on the Texas treaty which passed, requiring only a simple majority.

The nearly 68-year old Calhoun had suffered periodic bouts of [[tuberculosis]] throughout his life. In March 1850, the disease reached a critical stage.

He warned that the day \"the balance between the two sections\" was destroyed would be a day not far removed from disunion, anarchy, and civil war. Calhoun queried how the Union might be preserved in light of subjugation by the \"stronger\" party against the \"weaker\" one. He maintained that the responsibility of solving the question lay entirely on the North\u2014as the stronger section, to allow the Southern minority an equal share in governance and to cease the agitation. He added:\n{{quote|If you who represent the stronger portion, cannot agree to settle them on the broad principle of justice and duty, say so; and let the States we both represent agree to separate and part in peace.

Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" />\n\n[[File:G.P.A. Healy's portrait of John C. Calhoun, Charleston City Hall IMG 4589.JPG|thumb|[[George Peter Alexander Healy|George Peter Alexander Healy's]] 1851 painting of Calhoun on exhibit at City Hall in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]]|alt=Full profile, black suit with white ruffled shirt. Hand on chest with fingers spread out, soft look.]]\n\nCalhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, helped shape his son's political views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on a commitment to the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing in a world in which slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult.{{sfn|Bartlett|1994| p= 218}} He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key to the success of the American dream.{{sfn|Bartlett|1994| p= 228}}\n\nWhereas other Southern politicians had excused slavery as a \"necessary evil,\" in a famous [[:s:Slavery a Positive Good|speech on the Senate floor]] on February 6, 1837, Calhoun asserted that slavery was a \"positive good.\"<ref name=\"whathesaid\"/> He rooted this claim on two grounds: white supremacy and paternalism. All societies, Calhoun claimed, are ruled by an elite group that enjoys the fruits of the labor of a less-exceptional group. Senator [[William Cabell Rives]] of Virginia earlier had referred to slavery as an evil that might become a \"lesser evil\" in some circumstances. Calhoun believed that conceded too much to the abolitionists:{{sfn|Bartlett|1994|p=227}}\n\n{{quote|quote=I take higher ground. I hold that in the present state of civilization, where two races of different origin, and distinguished by color, and other physical differences, as well as intellectual, are brought together, the relation now existing in the slaveholding States between the two, is, instead of an evil, a good\u2014a positive good&nbsp;... I may say with truth, that in few countries so much is left to the share of the laborer, and so little exacted from him, or where there is more kind attention paid to him in sickness or infirmities of age. Compare his condition with the tenants of the poor houses in the more civilized portions of Europe\u2014look at the sick, and the old and infirm slave, on one hand, in the midst of his family and friends, under the kind superintending care of his master and mistress, and compare it with the forlorn and wretched condition of the pauper in the poorhouse&nbsp;... I hold then, that there never has yet existed a wealthy and civilized society in which one portion of the community did not, in point of fact, live on the labor of the other.{{sfn|Calhoun|1837|p=34}}}}\n\nCalhoun's treatment of his own slaves includes an incident in 1831, when his slave Alick ran away when threatened with a severe whipping. Calhoun wrote to his second cousin and brother-in-law, asking him to keep a lookout for Alick, and if he was taken, to have him \"severely whipped\" and sent back.<ref>Letter to James Edward Calhoun, August 27, 1831, [https://archive.org/details/correspondenceof00calhrich ''Correspondence of John C. Calhoun''], Historical Manuscripts Commission (1899), p. 301.</ref>  When Alick was captured, Calhoun wrote to the captor:\n{{quote|quote=I am glad to hear that Alick has been apprehended and am much obliged to you for paying the expense of apprehending him . . . . He ran away for no other cause, but to avoid a correction for some misconduct, and as I am desirous to prevent a repetition, I wish you to have him lodged in Jail for one week, to be fed on bread and water and to employ some one for me to give him 30 lashes well laid on, at the end of the time. I hope you will pardon the trouble. I only give it, because I deem it necessary to our proper security to prevent the formation of the habit of running away, and I think it better to punish him before his return home than afterwards.<ref>Letter to Armistead Burt of September 1, 1831, [https://archive.org/details/correspondenceof00calhrich ''Correspondence of John C. Calhoun''], Historical Manuscripts Commission (1899), pp. 301-02.</ref>}}\n\nCalhoun rejected the belief of Southern leaders such as Henry Clay that all Americans could agree on the \"opinion and feeling\" that slavery was wrong, although they might disagree on the most practicable way to respond to that great wrong. Calhoun's constitutional ideas acted as a viable conservative alternative to Northern appeals to democracy, majority rule, and natural rights.{{sfn|Ford|1988|pp=405\u2013424}}\n\nAs well as providing the intellectual justification of slavery, Calhoun played a central role in devising the South's overall political strategy. According to Phillips:\n\n{{quote|quote=Organization and strategy were widely demanded in Southern defense, and Calhoun came to be regarded as the main source of plans, arguments, and inspiration. His devices were manifold: to suppress agitation, to praise the slaveholding system; to promote white Southern prosperity and expansion; to procure a Western alliance; to  frame a fresh plan of government by concurrent majorities; to form a Southern  bloc; to warn the North of the dangers of Southern desperation; to appeal for Northern magnanimity as indispensable for the saving of the Union.{{sfn|Phillips|1929|p=416}}}}\n\nShortly after delivering his speech against the Compromise of 1850, Calhoun predicted the destruction of the Union over the slavery issue. Speaking to Senator Mason, he said:\n\n{{quote|I fix its probable occurrence within twelve years or three presidential terms. You and others of your age will probably live to see it; I shall not. The mode by which it will be done is not so clear; it may be brought about in a manner that no one now foresees. But the probability is, it will explode in a presidential election.{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=1}}}}\n\n===Opposition to the War with Mexico===\n[[File:Fort Hill.jpg|thumb|Calhoun's home, [[Fort Hill (Clemson)|Fort Hill]], on the grounds that became part of [[Clemson University]], in [[Clemson, South Carolina]]|alt=Large, classic style white house surrounded by lots of greenery.]]\nCalhoun was consistently opposed to the War with Mexico, arguing that an enlarged military effort would only feed the alarming and growing lust of the public for empire regardless of its constitutional dangers, bloat executive powers and patronage, and saddle the republic with a soaring debt that would disrupt finances and encourage speculation. Calhoun feared, moreover, that Southern slave owners would be shut out of any conquered Mexican territories, as nearly happened with the Wilmot Proviso. He argued that the war would detrimentally lead to the annexation of all of Mexico, which would bring Mexicans into the country, whom he considered deficient in moral and intellectual terms. He said, in a speech on January 4, 1848:\n\n{{quote|style=overflow:inherit;=|quote=We make a great mistake, sir, when we suppose that all people are capable of self-government. We are anxious to force free government on all; and I see that it has been urged in a very respectable quarter, that it is the mission of this country to spread civil and religious liberty over all the world, and especially over this continent. It is a great mistake. None but people advanced to a very high state of moral and intellectual improvement are capable, in a civilized state, of maintaining free government; and amongst those who are so purified, very few, indeed, have had the good fortune of forming a constitution capable of endurance.{{sfn|Calhoun|1999|p=68}}}}\n\nAnti-slavery Northerners denounced the war as a Southern conspiracy to expand slavery; Calhoun in turn perceived a connivance of Yankees to destroy the South. By 1847 he decided the Union was threatened by a totally corrupt [[Second Party System|party system]]. He believed that in their lust for office, patronage and [[spoils system|spoils]], politicians in the North pandered to the anti-slavery vote, especially during presidential campaigns, and politicians in the slave states sacrificed Southern rights in an effort to placate the Northern wings of their parties. Thus, the essential first step in any successful assertion of Southern rights had to be the jettisoning of all party ties. In 1848\u201349, Calhoun tried to give substance to his call for Southern unity. He was the driving force behind the drafting and publication of the \"Address of the Southern Delegates in Congress, to Their Constituents.\"{{sfn|Durham|2008|p=104}} It alleged Northern violations of the constitutional rights of the South, then warned Southern voters to expect forced emancipation of slaves in the near future, followed by their complete subjugation by an unholy alliance of unprincipled Northerners and blacks. Whites would flee and the South would \"become the permanent abode of disorder, anarchy, poverty, misery, and wretchedness.\"{{sfn|Calhoun|1870|p=311}} Only the immediate and unflinching unity of Southern whites could prevent such a disaster. Such unity would either bring the North to its senses or lay the foundation for an independent South. But the spirit of union was still strong in the region and fewer than 40% of the Southern congressmen signed the address, and only one Whig.{{sfn|Bartlett|1994}}\n\nMany Southerners believed his warnings and read every political news story from the North as further evidence of the planned destruction of the white southern way of life. The climax came a decade after Calhoun's death with the election of Republican [[Abraham Lincoln]] in [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]], which led to the secession of South Carolina, followed by six other Southern states. They formed the new [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]], which, in accordance with Calhoun's theory, did not have any organized political parties.{{sfn|Perman|2012|p=11}}\n\n===Concurrent majority===\n[[File:JohnCCalhoun.jpeg|thumb|upright|Undated photograph of Calhoun|alt=Full profile in oval frame, black scarf under quilted sweater, right arm draped over chair arm holding rim of hat. Austere look.]]\nCalhoun's basic concern for protecting the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science\u2014the idea of a [[concurrent majority]] across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority.{{sfn|Ford|1994|pp=19\u201358}} A concurrent majority is a system in which a minority group is permitted to exercise a sort of veto power over actions of a majority that are believed to infringe upon the minority's rights.{{sfn|Cheek|2004|p=146}}\n\nAccording to the principle of a numerical majority, the will of the more numerous citizens should always rule, regardless of the burdens on the minority. Such a principle tends toward a consolidation of power in which the interests of the absolute majority always prevail over those of the minority. Calhoun believed that the great achievement of the American constitution was in checking the tyranny of a numerical majority through institutional procedures that required a concurrent majority, such that each important interest in the community must consent to the actions of government. To secure a concurrent majority, those interests that have a numerical majority must compromise with the interests that are in the minority. A concurrent majority requires a unanimous consent of all the major interests in a community, which is the only sure way of preventing [[tyranny of the majority]]. This idea supported Calhoun's doctrine of interposition or nullification, in which the state governments could refuse to enforce or comply with a policy of the Federal government that threatened the vital interests of the states.<ref>{{cite web |last = Kirk |first = Russell |url = http://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/review/john-c-calhoun-vindicated |title = John C. Calhoun Vindicated |publisher = The Abbeville Institute |date = March 17, 2015 |accessdate = May 18, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Richard Hofstadter]] (1948) emphasizes that Calhoun's conception of ''minority'' was very different from the minorities of a century later:\n\n{{quote|style=overflow:inherit;=|quote=Not in the slightest was [Calhoun] concerned with minority rights as they are chiefly of interest to the modern liberal mind\u2014the rights of dissenters to express unorthodox opinions, of the individual conscience against the State, least of all of ethnic minorities. At bottom he was not interested in any minority that was not a propertied minority. The concurrent majority itself was a device without relevance to the protection of dissent, designed to protect a vested interest of considerable power&nbsp;... it was minority privileges rather than [minority] rights that he really proposed to protect.{{sfn|Hofstadter|2011|pp=90\u201391}}}}\n\nUnlike Jefferson, Calhoun rejected attempts at economic, social, or political leveling, claiming that true equality could not be achieved if all classes were given equal rights and responsibilities. Rather, to ensure true prosperity, it was necessary for a stronger group to provide protection and care for the weaker one. This meant that the two groups should not be equal before the law. For Calhoun, \"protection\" (order) was more important than freedom. Individual rights were something to be earned, not something bestowed by nature or God.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun: He Started the Civil War\" /> Calhoun was concerned with protecting the interests of the Southern States (which he identified with the interests of their slaveholding elites) as a distinct and beleaguered minority among the members of the federal Union; his idea of a concurrent majority as a protection for minority rights has gained some acceptance in American political thought.{{sfn|Baskin|1969|pp=49\u201365}}{{sfn|Kateb |1969 |pp=583\u2013605}} Political scientist Malcolm Jewell argues, \"The decision-making process in this country resembles John Calhoun's 'concurrent majority': A large number of groups both within and outside the government must, in practice, approve any major policy.\"{{sfn|Jewell|2015|p=2}}\n\nCalhoun's ideas on the concurrent majority are illustrated in ''[[A Disquisition on Government]]''. The ''Disquisition'' is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion.{{sfn|Bartlett|1994| pp= 351\u2013355}} It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy.{{sfn|Freehling|1965|pp=25\u201342}}\n\n===State sovereignty and the \"Calhoun Doctrine\"===\nIn the 1840s three interpretations of the constitutional powers of Congress to deal with slavery in territories emerged: the \"free-soil doctrine,\" the \"[[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]] position,\" and the \"Calhoun doctrine.\" The Free Soilers stated that Congress had the power to outlaw slavery in the territories. The popular sovereignty position argued that the voters living there should decide. The Calhoun doctrine said that Congress and the citizens of the territories could never outlaw slavery in the territories.{{sfn|Fehrenbacher|1981|pp= 64\u201365}}\n\nIn what historian Robert R. Russell calls the \"Calhoun Doctrine,\" Calhoun argued that the Federal Government's role in the territories was only that of the trustee or agent of the several sovereign states: it was obliged not to discriminate among the states and hence was incapable of forbidding the bringing into any territory of anything that was legal property in any state. Calhoun argued that citizens from every state had the right to take their property to any territory. Congress and local voters, he asserted, had no authority to place restrictions on slavery in the territories.{{sfn|Russell|1966|pp=466\u2013486}}  In a February 1847 speech before the Senate, Calhoun declared that \"the enacthment of any law which should directly, or by its effects, deprive the citizens of any of the States of this Union from emigrating, with their property, in to any of the territories of the United States, will make such discrimination and would  therefore be a violation of the Constitution.\" Enslavers therefore had a fundamental right to take their property wherever they wished.{{sfn|Baptist|2014|p=331}} As constitutional historian [[Hermann Eduard von Holst|Hermann von Holst]] noted, \"Calhoun's doctrine made it a solemn constitutional duty of the United States government and of the American people to act as if the existence or non-existence of slavery in the Territories did not concern them in the least.\"{{sfn|von Holst|1883|p=312}} The Calhoun Doctrine was opposed by the Free Soil forces, which merged into the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] around 1854.{{sfn|Foner|1995|p= 178}} Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] based his decision in the 1857 Supreme Court case ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]],'' in which he ruled that the federal government could not prohibit slavery in any of the territories, upon Calhoun's arguments. Moderates rejected these beliefs, and Taney's decision became a major point of partisan attack by the Republican Party.{{sfn|Rosen|2007|pp=78\u201379}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Jcctypo01.jpg|thumb|upright|John C.

On his deathbed, Jackson regretted that he had not had Calhoun executed for treason. \"My country,\" he declared, \"would have sustained me in the act, and his fate would have been a warning to traitors in all time to come.\" Even after his death, Calhoun's reputation among Jacksonians remained poor. They disparaged him by portraying him as a man thirsty for power, who when he failed to attain it, sought to tear down his country with him. According to Parton, writing in 1860:\n{{quote|The old Jackson men of the inner set still speak of Mr. Calhoun in terms which show that they consider him at once the most wicked and the most despicable of American statesmen. He was a coward, conspirator, hypocrite, traitor, and fool, say they. He strove, schemed, dreamed, lived only for the presidency; and when he despaired of reaching that office through honorable means, he sought to rise upon the ruins of his country-thinking it better to reign in South Carolina than to serve in the United States. General Jackson lived and died in this opinion.{{sfn|Parton|1860|p=447}}}}\n\nCalhoun is often remembered for his defense of minority rights, in the context of defending white Southern interests from perceived Northern threats, by use of the \"concurrent majority.\" He is also noted and criticized for his strong defense of slavery. These positions played an enormous role in influencing Southern secessionist leaders by strengthening the trend of sectionalism, thus contributing to the Civil War.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun: He Started the Civil War\" /> During his lifetime and after, Calhoun was seen as one of the Senate's most important figures. In 1957, a Senate committee chaired by [[John F. Kennedy]] selected Calhoun as one of the five greatest United States senators in history.<ref name=\"The Famous Five\"/> Biographer Irving Bartlett wrote:\n{{quote|Posterity decided against Calhoun's argument for the indefinite protection of slavery more than 130 years ago.
