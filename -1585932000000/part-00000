I think it was supposed to be with one of the assistants at Clarksons, who professed to know a great deal more than he did, and in particular stated that we used the expression \"Bunga-Bunga\".

As such ''bunga bunga'' (written as ''bunga-bunga)'' is simply the plural form of ''[[flower]].''

It was acquired by [[National Australia Bank]] (NAB) in 1990 and was merged into NAB's other subsidiary, [[Clydesdale Bank]] in 2005, continuing to operate as distinct trading division. In 2016 NAB divested its UK operations as [[CYBG plc]] which went on to acquire [[Virgin Money UK|Virgin Money plc]] in 2018. The Yorkshire Bank name is expected to be phased out in favour of the Virgin Money brand during 2020.\n\n==History==\n===Beginnings===\nThe bank was established on 1 May 1859 by Colonel [[Edward Akroyd]] of Halifax. Based in Leeds in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] it was known as the '''West Riding Penny Savings Bank'''. It had originally been planned as a [[provident society]] but the status of [[savings bank]] was eventually chosen.\n\nThe bank was registered under the [[Friendly Societies Act]] and individual deposits were restricted to \u00a330 per annum, up to a cumulative balance of \u00a3150. Within a year, the bank had opened 24 branches, and a further 104 in the year after. Sub-branches were opened in schools and church halls.\n\n[[File:Yorkshire Penny Bank blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Yorkshire Penny Bank blue plaque]]\n\nThe bank was operated on a non profit making basis and in 1860 it was decided to extend operation to the other [[Riding (division)|Ridings]] of [[Yorkshire]]. To recognise this the name was changed to the '''Yorkshire Penny Bank'''. In 1872, it issued [[Cheque|cheque books]] for the first time, primarily for small tradesmen. At that time the bank became the first to create ''school banks'', to encourage the idea of saving at an early age.\n\nIn 1911 depositors' balances were valued at \u00a318&nbsp;million although reserves were only \u00a3500,000 and that existing guarantees were not enough. The [[Bank of England]] organised a takeover by a consortium of banks ([[National Provincial Bank]], [[Westminster Bank]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland|Williams Deacons Bank]], [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]], [[Barclays Bank]], [[Williams and Glyn's Bank|Glyn Mills]]) and the Yorkshire Penny Bank adopted [[limited liability]]. After this the bank was able to offer overdrafts for the first time.\n\n===Yorkshire Bank Ltd===\nIn its centenary year of 1959, the bank's name changed to '''Yorkshire Bank Limited'''. During the 1970s the bank became one of the first to offer fee free banking whilst in credit, a move that took bigger rivals a decade to follow. In 1982, it adopted [[public limited company]] status.\n\nDuring the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|miners' strike]] from 1984 to 1985, the bank offered [[miner]]s who were mortgage holders a deferment, allowing them to postpone payments for the duration of the dispute. The strike took place in the bank's heartland and many miners were customers, having been encouraged by the [[National Coal Board]] to have their pay mandated to a bank account.\n\n[[File:YorksBank.jpg|thumb|right|A high street branch of the Yorkshire Bank in [[Peterborough]]]]\n\n===Acquisition by National Australia Bank===\nIn 1990, the [[National Australia Bank]] Group acquired the bank from the consortium of owning banks which, after mergers and acquisitions, were the [[National Westminster Bank]], (holders of 40%), [[Barclays Bank]] (32%), [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] (20%), and [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] (8%). The price paid was \u00a31&nbsp;billion and the bank joined National Australia Bank's other European businesses, [[Clydesdale Bank]] (Scotland) and [[Northern Bank]] (which operated in both jurisdictions in Ireland).\n\nIn May 2005, the National Australia Bank announced its intention to merge the Yorkshire Bank with the Clydesdale under one operating licence, in which the former would be a trading name of the latter. Both operate under separate identities although the Clydesdale brand is the one that has been used in further expansion into the south of England ([[Northern Bank]] was sold to [[Danske Bank]] of Denmark along with its operations in the Republic of Ireland, the [[National Irish Bank]]). At the same time 40 branches were closed, a reduction of a fifth of the Yorkshire Bank network.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4534909.stm|title=Bank to shut down 100 UK branches|work=[[BBC Online]]|date=11 May 2005|accessdate=11 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 underlying profit rose 16.7&nbsp;per cent to \u00a3454&nbsp;million compared with a year earlier, while post-tax earnings climbed 12.8&nbsp;per cent to \u00a3229&nbsp;million.

The [[Bank of England]] organised a takeover by a consortium of banks ([[National Provincial Bank]], [[Westminster Bank]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland|Williams Deacons Bank]], [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]], [[Barclays Bank]], [[Williams and Glyn's Bank|Glyn Mills]]) and the Yorkshire Penny Bank adopted [[limited liability]]. After this the bank was able to offer overdrafts for the first time.\n\n===Yorkshire Bank Ltd===\nIn its centenary year of 1959, the bank's name changed to '''Yorkshire Bank Limited'''. During the 1970s the bank became one of the first to offer fee free banking whilst in credit, a move that took bigger rivals a decade to follow. In 1982, it adopted [[public limited company]] status.\n\nDuring the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|miners' strike]] from 1984 to 1985, the bank offered [[miner]]s who were mortgage holders a deferment, allowing them to postpone payments for the duration of the dispute. The strike took place in the bank's heartland and many miners were customers, having been encouraged by the [[National Coal Board]] to have their pay mandated to a bank account.\n\n[[File:YorksBank.jpg|thumb|right|A high street branch of the Yorkshire Bank in [[Peterborough]]]]\n\n===Acquisition by National Australia Bank===\nIn 1990, the [[National Australia Bank]] Group acquired the bank from the consortium of owning banks which, after mergers and acquisitions, were the [[National Westminster Bank]], (holders of 40%), [[Barclays Bank]] (32%), [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] (20%), and [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] (8%). The price paid was \u00a31&nbsp;billion and the bank joined National Australia Bank's other European businesses, [[Clydesdale Bank]] (Scotland) and [[Northern Bank]] (which operated in both jurisdictions in Ireland).\n\nIn May 2005, the National Australia Bank announced its intention to merge the Yorkshire Bank with the Clydesdale under one operating licence, in which the former would be a trading name of the latter. Both operate under separate identities although the Clydesdale brand is the one that has been used in further expansion into the south of England ([[Northern Bank]] was sold to [[Danske Bank]] of Denmark along with its operations in the Republic of Ireland, the [[National Irish Bank]]). At the same time 40 branches were closed, a reduction of a fifth of the Yorkshire Bank network.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4534909.stm|title=Bank to shut down 100 UK branches|work=[[BBC Online]]|date=11 May 2005|accessdate=11 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 underlying profit rose 16.7&nbsp;per cent to \u00a3454&nbsp;million compared with a year earlier, while post-tax earnings climbed 12.8&nbsp;per cent to \u00a3229&nbsp;million.

If proven to be a leech, it would be the oldest in the fossil record.]]\nPrior to the discovery of the Waukesha Biota, very little was known about the soft-bodied animals that were sure to have lived in the Silurian seas. Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were known to be preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the \"anatomical disparity\" of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world \u2013one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \"Brandon Bridge fauna\"\u2013 and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.

If proven to be a leech, it would be the oldest in the fossil record.]]\nPrior to the discovery of the Waukesha Biota, very little was known about the soft-bodied animals that were sure to have lived in the Silurian seas. Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were known to be preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the \"anatomical disparity\" of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world \u2013one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \"Brandon Bridge fauna\"\u2013 and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.

{"title_page": "Voltage reduction", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\nIn a simple [[resistive circuit]], a reduction in the [[voltage]] across the resistance will result in a reduction in the [[Electric power|power]] dissipated by the [[Electrical network|circuit]].\n\n==Electric utilities==\n[[Electric utilities]] have discovered that this basic principle can save utility companies, and their customers, a significant amount of money. Utilities are able to shave the peak of their power demand curves by reducing the voltage across their distribution system. When a utility reaches a point where power demand is expected to exceed supply, utilities only have two options. Either purchase power from another utility, usually at substantial prices, or reduce demand. Often utilities use load management systems to turn off customers' [[air conditioners]], [[water heating|water heaters]], and pool pumps to reduce demand.  Voltage reduction has become another option for utilities to reduce demand&mdash;typically unbeknownst to the customer. However, only the resistive portion of the load responds to the reduction in voltage to reduce aggregate demand. Loads such as [[incandescent lights]] and heater coils will use less power as the voltage is lowered. On the other hand, [[induction motor]] loads are unaffected by the reduction in voltage, because the current simply rises to account for no change or even a slight increase in power consumption. '''Current rise is detrimental to motors, since they run hotter. Also, to accomplish the same work the motors have to run longer, for example, if a refrigerator is running at 35% duty cycle at nominal voltage, at lower voltage its duty cycle may increase to 40%. Running hotter and running longer shortens the service longevity of motors.\n'''\nEven some resistive loads provide only short-term benefits. A phenomenon known as load diversity plays a role in voltage reduction and can counteract its effects on occasion. The concept of load diversity can most easily be explained with an example. In your neighborhood, it is unlikely that all of the homes' water heaters are on at the same time. Particularly during non-hot water usage hours (morning and evening showers), when your hot water heater is on, your neighbor's may be off. Due to the distributed and noncoincident nature of these loads, the aggregate peak can remain relatively constant. However, if the voltage is reduced to all of the resistive elements in the water heaters, the elements will not be able to heat the water as quickly. While an immediate reduction in the power demand will be recognized upon initiating voltage reduction, over time water heaters will need to be on longer to achieve the thermostat-set water temperature. Thus, more water heaters will be on at the same time. This will cause the aggregate peak to increase substantially. Therefore, with respect to thermostat-controlled resistive loads, the benefits of voltage reduction can be short lived, and may occasionally end up increasing the aggregate load demand.\n\nConversely increasing the voltage may increase power demand from the resistive loads. Again, the thermostat-controlled resistive loads will react differently, but it is clear that it will cost a customer more to turn on that incandescent reading lamp with higher voltage than it would at a lower voltage. '''Of course this is assuming that the customer is satisfied with dimmer light, otherwise the customer can replace the light bulbs with ones of higher wattage to provide sufficient lighting. In today's modern world many light fixtures, including the ones with LED type bulbs, are dimmable. Therefore at lower voltage the dimmer will be turned up and at higher voltage it will be turned down, resulting in the same lumens being generated by the light fixture, hence no energy savings will take place. A good comparison of methodology of lowering the voltage to save energy is to draw a parallel with lowering the water pressure to save water. The washing machine will have to fill to the same level, it will just take longer; the toilet tank will fill to the same level, etc. Irrelevant of the pressure the customer will have to use all the necessary water to get the desirable results. There will be short-term savings because the lawn will not get sufficiently watered, but the customer will eventually notice this and will adjust the valves, watering duration or the number of sprinkler heads to compensate for the lower pressure.\n'''\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.ieso.ca/imoweb/siteShared/voltage_reduction.asp?sid=ic\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Voltage Reduction}}\n[[Category:Electric power distribution]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\nIn a simple [[resistive circuit]], a reduction in the [[voltage]] across the resistance will result in a reduction in the [[Electric power|power]] dissipated by the [[Electrical network|circuit]].\n\n==Electric utilities==\n[[Electric utilities]] have discovered that this basic principle can save utility companies, and their customers, a significant amount of money.

Voltage reduction has become another option for utilities to reduce demand&mdash;typically unbeknownst to the customer. However, only the resistive portion of the load responds to the reduction in voltage to reduce aggregate demand. Loads such as [[incandescent lights]] and heater coils will use less power as the voltage is lowered. On the other hand, [[induction motor]] loads are unaffected by the reduction in voltage, because the current simply rises to account for no change or even a slight increase in power consumption. '''Current rise is detrimental to motors, since they run hotter. Also, to accomplish the same work the motors have to run longer, for example, if a refrigerator is running at 35% duty cycle at nominal voltage, at lower voltage its duty cycle may increase to 40%. Running hotter and running longer shortens the service longevity of motors.\n'''\nEven some resistive loads provide only short-term benefits. A phenomenon known as load diversity plays a role in voltage reduction and can counteract its effects on occasion. The concept of load diversity can most easily be explained with an example. In your neighborhood, it is unlikely that all of the homes' water heaters are on at the same time. Particularly during non-hot water usage hours (morning and evening showers), when your hot water heater is on, your neighbor's may be off. Due to the distributed and noncoincident nature of these loads, the aggregate peak can remain relatively constant. However, if the voltage is reduced to all of the resistive elements in the water heaters, the elements will not be able to heat the water as quickly. While an immediate reduction in the power demand will be recognized upon initiating voltage reduction, over time water heaters will need to be on longer to achieve the thermostat-set water temperature. Thus, more water heaters will be on at the same time. This will cause the aggregate peak to increase substantially. Therefore, with respect to thermostat-controlled resistive loads, the benefits of voltage reduction can be short lived, and may occasionally end up increasing the aggregate load demand.\n\nConversely increasing the voltage may increase power demand from the resistive loads. Again, the thermostat-controlled resistive loads will react differently, but it is clear that it will cost a customer more to turn on that incandescent reading lamp with higher voltage than it would at a lower voltage. '''Of course this is assuming that the customer is satisfied with dimmer light, otherwise the customer can replace the light bulbs with ones of higher wattage to provide sufficient lighting. In today's modern world many light fixtures, including the ones with LED type bulbs, are dimmable. Therefore at lower voltage the dimmer will be turned up and at higher voltage it will be turned down, resulting in the same lumens being generated by the light fixture, hence no energy savings will take place. A good comparison of methodology of lowering the voltage to save energy is to draw a parallel with lowering the water pressure to save water. The washing machine will have to fill to the same level, it will just take longer; the toilet tank will fill to the same level, etc. Irrelevant of the pressure the customer will have to use all the necessary water to get the desirable results. There will be short-term savings because the lawn will not get sufficiently watered, but the customer will eventually notice this and will adjust the valves, watering duration or the number of sprinkler heads to compensate for the lower pressure.\n'''\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.ieso.ca/imoweb/siteShared/voltage_reduction.asp?sid=ic\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Voltage Reduction}}\n[[Category:Electric power distribution]]\n", "name_user": "TheAwesomeHwyh", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:water heater\u2192water heating", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_reduction"}

Ventilation is mainly used to control [[indoor air quality]] by diluting and displacing indoor pollutants; it can also be used to control indoor temperature, humidity, and air motion to benefit [[thermal comfort]], satisfaction with other aspects of indoor environment, or other objectives.\n\nThe intentional introduction of outdoor air is usually categorized as either mechanical ventilation, [[natural ventilation]]<ref>Ventilation and Infiltration chapter, Fundamentals volume of the ''ASHRAE Handbook'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, 2005</ref> , or [[mixed-mode ventilation]] (hybrid ventilation).\n\n* Mechanical ventilation is the intentional fan driven flow of outdoor air into a building. Mechanical ventilation systems may include supply fans (which push outdoor air into a building), exhaust fans (which draw air out of building and thereby cause equal ventilation flow into a building), or a combination of both. Mechanical ventilation is often provided by equipment that is also used to heat and cool a space.\n\n* [[Natural ventilation]] is the intentional passive flow of outdoor air into a building through planned openings (such as louvers, doors, and windows). Natural ventilation does not require mechanical systems to move outdoor air. Instead, it relies entirely on passive physical phenomena, such as [[wind pressure]], or the [[stack effect]]. Natural ventilation openings may be fixed, or adjustable.  Adjustable openings may be controlled automatically (automated), controlled by occupants (operable), or a combination of both.\n\n* [[Mixed-mode ventilation]] systems use both mechanical and natural processes. The mechanical and natural components may be used at the same time, or at different times of day, or in different seasons of the year.<ref>de Gids W.F., Jicha M., 2010. \"[http://www.aivc.org/resource/vip-32-hybrid-ventilation Ventilation Information Paper 32: Hybrid Ventilation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117023431/http://www.aivc.org/resource/vip-32-hybrid-ventilation |date=2015-11-17 }}\", Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 2010</ref> Since natural ventilation flow depends on environmental conditions, it may not always provide an appropriate amount of ventilation. In this case, mechanical systems may be used to supplement or regulate the naturally driven flow.\n\nVentilation is typically described as separate from infiltration. \n\n* [[Infiltration (HVAC)|Infiltration]] is the circumstantial flow of air from outdoors to indoors through leaks (unplanned openings) in a [[building envelope]]. When a building design relies on infiltration to maintain indoor air quality, this flow has been referred to as adventitious ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schiavon|first=Stefano|date=2014|title=Adventitious ventilation: a new definition for an old mode?|journal=Indoor Air|language=en|volume=24|issue=6|pages=557\u2013558|doi=10.1111/ina.12155|pmid=25376521|issn=1600-0668}}</ref>\n\nThe design of buildings that promote occupant health and well being requires clear understanding of the ways that ventilation airflow interacts with, dilutes, displaces or introduces pollutants within the occupied space. Although ventilation is an integral component to maintaining good indoor air quality, it may not be satisfactory alone.<ref>''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1, Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA</ref> In scenarios where outdoor pollution would deteriorate indoor air quality, other treatment devices such as filtration may also be necessary. In [[kitchen ventilation]] systems, or for laboratory [[fume hood]]s, the design of effective effluent capture can be more important than the bulk amount of ventilation in a space. More generally, the way that an air distribution system causes ventilation to flow into and out of a space impacts the ability for a particular ventilation rate to remove internally generated pollutants. The ability for a system to reduce pollution in a space is described as its \"ventilation effectiveness\".  However, the overall impacts of ventilation on indoor air quality can depend on more complex factors such as the sources of pollution, and the ways that activities and airflow interact to affect occupant exposure.\n\nAn array of factors related to design and operation of ventilation systems are regulated by various codes and standards.  Standards dealing with the design and operation of ventilation systems for the purpose of achieving acceptable indoor air quality include: ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 62.2, the International Residential Code, the International Mechanical Code, and the [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom#Part F. Ventilation|United Kingdom Building Regulations Part F]].  Other standards focused on energy conservation also impact the design and operation of ventilation systems, including: ASHRAE Standard 90.1, and the International Energy Conservation Code.  \n\nIn many instances, ventilation for indoor air quality is simultaneously beneficial for the control of thermal comfort. At these times, it can be useful to increase the rate of ventilation beyond the minimum required for indoor air quality. Two examples include [[Economizer|air-side economizer]] cooling and [[Ventilative cooling|ventilative]] pre-cooling. In other instances, ventilation for indoor air quality contributes to the need for - and energy use by - mechanical heating and cooling equipment. In hot and humid climates, dehumidification of ventilation air can be a particularly energy intensive process.\n\nVentilation should be considered for its relationship to \"venting\" for appliances and combustion equipment such as [[water heating|water heaters]], furnaces, [[boiler]]s, and wood stoves. Most importantly, the design of building ventilation must be careful to avoid the backdraft of combustion products from \"naturally vented\" appliances into the occupied space. This issue is of greater importance for buildings with more air tight envelopes. To avoid the hazard, many modern combustion appliances utilize \"direct venting\" which draws combustion air directly from outdoors, instead of from the indoor environment.\n\n== Ventilation rates for indoor air quality ==\nThe ventilation rate, for CII buildings, is normally expressed by the volumetric flowrate of outdoor air, introduced to the building.  The typical units used are cubic feet per minute (CFM) or liters per second (L/s).  The ventilation rate can also be expressed on a per person or per unit floor area basis, such as CFM/p or CFM/ft\u00b2, or as ''[[air changes per hour]]'' (ACH).\n\n===Standards for residential buildings===\nFor residential buildings, which mostly rely on [[Infiltration (HVAC)|infiltration]] for meeting their ventilation needs, a common ventilation rate measure is the [[air changes per hour|air change rate]] (or [[air changes per hour]]): the hourly ventilation rate divided by the volume of the space (''I'' or ''ACH''; units of 1/h). During the winter, ACH may range from 0.50 to 0.41 in a tightly air-sealed house to 1.11 to 1.47 in a loosely air-sealed house.<ref>Kavanaugh, Steve. Infiltration and Ventilation In Residential Structures. February 2004</ref>\n\nASHRAE now recommends ventilation rates dependent upon floor area, as a revision to the 62-2001 standard, in which the minimum ACH was 0.35, but no less than 15 CFM/person (7.1 L/s/person). As of 2003, the standard has been changed to 3 CFM/100 sq. ft. (15 l/s/100 sq. m.) plus 7.5 CFM/person (3.5 L/s/person).<ref>{{cite web|title=ASHRAE's First Residential Ventilation Standard|url=http://epb.lbl.gov/Publications/lbnl-54331.pdf|publisher=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]|author=M.H.

It also accounts for potential contaminants that may have no measured limits, or for which no limits are not set (such as formaldehyde offgassing from carpet and furniture).\n\n==Natural ventilation==\n{{Main article|Natural ventilation}}\n[[Natural ventilation]] harnesses naturally available forces to supply and remove air in an enclosed space. There are three types of natural ventilation occurring in buildings: [[wind driven ventilation]], pressure-driven flows, and [[stack ventilation]].<ref>How Natural Ventilation Works by Steven J.

The approach deliver fresh air more directly to the breathing zone and aims to improve air quality of inhaled air. Personalized ventilation provides a much higher ventilation effectiveness than conventional mixing ventilation systems by displacing pollution from the breathing zone far less air volume. Beyond improved air quality benefits, the strategy can also improve occupant's thermal comfort, perceived air quality, and overall satisfaction with the indoor environment. Individual's preferences for temperature and air movement are not equal, and so traditional approaches to homogeneous environmental control have failed to achieve high occupant satisfaction. Techniques such as personalized ventilation facilitate control of a more diverse thermal environment that can improve thermal satisfaction for most occupants.\n\n===Local exhaust ventilation===\nLocal exhaust ventilation addresses the issue of avoiding the contamination of indoor air by specific high-emission sources by capturing airborne contaminants before they are spread into the environment. This can include water vapor control, lavatory bioeffluent control, solvent vapors from industrial processes, and dust from wood- and metal-working machinery. Air can be exhausted through pressurized hoods or through the use of fans and pressurizing a specific area.<ref name=\"osha.gov\">{{cite web |url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10631 |title=Ventilation. - 1926.57 |publisher=Osha.gov |accessdate=2012-11-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202023212/http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10631 |archivedate=2012-12-02 }}</ref><br />A local exhaust system is composed of 5 basic parts\n\n# A hood that captures the contaminant at its source\n# Ducts for transporting the air\n# An air-cleaning device that removes/minimizes the contaminant\n# A fan that moves the air through the system\n# An exhaust stack through which the contaminated air is discharged<ref name=\"osha.gov\" />\n\nIn the UK, the use of LEV systems have regulations set out by the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) which are referred to as the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health ([[COSHH|CoSHH]]). Under CoSHH, legislation is set out to protect users of LEV systems by ensuring that all equipment is tested at least every fourteen months to ensure the LEV systems are performing adequately. All parts of the system must be visually inspected and thoroughly tested and where any parts are found to be defective, the inspector must issue a red label to identify the defective part and the issue.\n\nThe owner of the LEV system must then have the defective parts repaired or replaced before the system can be used.\n\n==Smart Ventilation==\nSmart ventilation is a process to continually adjust the ventilation system in time, and optionally by location, to provide the desired IAQ benefits while minimizing energy consumption, utility bills and other non-IAQ costs (such as thermal discomfort or noise). \nA smart ventilation system adjusts ventilation rates in time or by location in a building to be responsive to one or more of the following: occupancy, outdoor thermal and air quality conditions, electricity grid needs, direct sensing of contaminants, operation of other air moving and air cleaning systems. \nIn addition, smart ventilation systems can provide information to building owners, occupants, and managers on operational energy consumption and indoor air quality as well as signal when systems need maintenance or repair. \nBeing responsive to occupancy means that a smart ventilation system can adjust ventilation depending on demand such as reducing ventilation if the building is unoccupied. \nSmart ventilation can time-shift ventilation to periods when a) indoor-outdoor temperature differences are smaller (and away from peak outdoor temperatures and humidity), b) when indoor-outdoor temperatures are appropriate for ventilative cooling, or c) when outdoor air quality is acceptable. \nBeing responsive to electricity grid needs means providing flexibility to electricity demand (including direct signals from utilities) and integration with electric grid control strategies. \nSmart ventilation systems can have sensors to detect air flow, systems pressures or fan energy use in such a way that systems failures can be detected and repaired, as well as when system components need maintenance, such as filter replacement. <ref>Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC). \"[https://www.aivc.org/resources/faqs/what-smart-ventilation What is smart ventilation?]\", AIVC, 2018</ref>\n\n==Ventilation and combustion==\n\n[[Combustion]] (e.g., [[fireplace]], [[gas heater]], [[candle]], [[oil lamp]], etc.) consumes oxygen while producing carbon dioxide and other unhealthy [[gas]]es and [[smoke]], requiring ventilation air. An open [[chimney]] promotes infiltration (i.e. natural ventilation) because of the negative pressure change induced by the [[buoyant]], warmer air leaving through the chimney. The warm air is typically replaced by heavier, cold air.\n\nVentilation in a structure is also needed for removing [[water vapor]] produced by [[Respiratory system|respiration]], burning, and [[cooking]], and for removing odors. If water vapor is permitted to accumulate, it may damage the structure, [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], or finishes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} When operating, an [[air conditioner]] usually removes excess moisture from the air. A [[dehumidifier]] may also be appropriate for removing airborne moisture.\n\n== Calculation for acceptable ventilation rate ==\nVentilation guidelines are based upon the minimum ventilation rate required to maintain acceptable levels of bioeffluents. Carbon dioxide is used as a reference point, as it is the gas of highest emission at a relatively constant value of 0.005 L/s. The mass balance equation is:\n\nQ = G/(C<sub>i</sub> \u2212 C<sub>a</sub>)\n\n*Q = ventilation rate (L/s)\n*G = CO<sub>2</sub> generation rate\n*C<sub>i</sub> = acceptable indoor CO<sub>2</sub> concentration\n*C<sub>a</sub> = ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wapa.gov/es/pubs/techbrf/co2.htm|title=Home|publisher=Wapa.gov|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726145058/http://www.wapa.gov/es/pubs/techbrf/co2.htm|archivedate=2011-07-26|accessdate=2012-11-10}}</ref>\n\n==Smoking and ventilation==\nASHRAE standard 62 states that air removed from an area with [[environmental tobacco smoke]] shall not be recirculated into ETS-free air.

An early method of ventilation was the use of a ventilating fire near an air vent which would forcibly cause the air in the building to circulate. English engineer [[John Theophilus Desaguliers]] provided an early example of this, when he installed ventilating fires in the air tubes on the roof of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. Starting with the [[Covent Garden Theatre]], gas burning [[chandelier]]s on the ceiling were often specially designed to perform a ventilating role.\n\n===Mechanical systems===\nA more sophisticated system involving the use of mechanical equipment to circulate the air was developed in the mid 19th century. A basic system of [[bellows]] was put in place to ventilate [[Newgate Prison]] and outlying buildings, by the engineer [[Stephen Hales]] in the mid-1700s. The problem with these early devices was that they required constant human labour to operate. [[David Boswell Reid]] was called to testify before a Parliamentary committee on proposed architectural designs for the new [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], after the old one burned down in a fire in 1834.<ref name=\"Porter\">{{cite book |first=Dale H. |last=Porter |title=The Life and Times of Sir Goldsworthy Gurney: Gentleman scientist and inventor, 1793\u20131875 |year=1998|pages=177&ndash;179 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ta3d0qWpPMsC&pg=PA177 |publisher=Associated University Presses, Inc. |isbn=0-934223-50-5}}</ref> In January 1840 Reid was appointed by the committee for the [[House of Lords]] dealing with the construction of the replacement for the Houses of Parliament.

Early hypotheses included excess concentrations of CO2 and [[oxygen depletion]]. However, by the late 1800s, scientists thought biological contamination, not oxygen or CO2, as the primary component of unacceptable indoor air. However, it was noted as early as 1872 that CO2 concentration closely correlates to perceived air quality.\n\nThe first estimate of minimum ventilation rates was developed by Tredgold in 1836.<ref>Tredgold, T. 1836. \"The Principles of Warming and Ventilation - Public Buildings\". London: M. Taylor</ref> This was followed by subsequent studies on the topic by Billings <ref>Billings, J.S. 1886. \"The principles of ventilation and heating and their practical application 2d ed., with corrections\" {{cite book|title=Archived copy|ol = 22096429M}}</ref> in 1886 and Flugge in 1905.  The recommendations of Billings and Flugge were incorporated into numerous building codes from 1900-1920s, and published as an industry standard by ASHVE (the predecessor to [[ASHRAE]]) in 1914.<ref name=\"Janssen\" />\n\nStudy continued into the varied effects of [[thermal comfort]], oxygen, carbon dioxide, and biological contaminants. Research was conducted with humans subjects controlled test chambers. Two studies, published between 1909 and 1911, showed that carbon dioxide was not the offending component. Subjects remained satisfied in chambers with high levels of CO2, so long as the chamber remained cool.<ref name=\"Janssen\" /> (Subsequently, it has been determined that CO2 is, in fact, harmful at concentrations over 50,000ppm<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/124389.html|title=CDC - Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH): Carbon dioxide - NIOSH Publications and Products|date=1 November 2017|website=www.cdc.gov|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420005202/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/124389.html|archivedate=20 April 2018|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>)\n\nASHVE began a robust research effort in 1919. By 1935, ASHVE funded research conducted by Lemberg, Brandt, and Morse - again using human subjects in test chambers - suggested the primary component of \"bad air\" was odor, perceived by the human olfactory nerves.<ref>Lemberg WH, Brandt AD, and Morse, K. 1935. \"A laboratory study of minimum ventilation requirements: ventilation box experiments\". ASHVE Transactions, V. 41</ref> Human response to odor was found to be logarithmic to contaminant concentrations, and related to temperature. At lower, more comfortable temperatures, lower ventilation rates were satisfactory.  A 1936 human test chamber study by Yaglou, Riley, and Coggins culminated much of this effort, considering odor, room volume, occupant age, cooling equipment effects, and recirculated air implications, which provided guidance for ventilation rates.<ref>Yaglou CPE, Riley C, and Coggins DI. 1936. \"Ventilation Requirements\" ASHVE Transactions, v.32</ref> The Yaglou research has been validated, and adopted into industry standards, beginning with the ASA code in 1946. From this research base, [[ASHRAE]] (having replaced ASHVE) developed space by space recommendations, and published them as ASHRAE Standard 62-1975: Ventilation for acceptable indoor air quality.\n\nAs more architecture incorporated mechanical ventilation, the cost of outdoor air ventilation came under some scrutiny. In 1973, in response to the [[1973 oil crisis]] and conservation concerns, ASHRAE Standards 62-73 and 62-81) reduced required ventilation from 10 CFM (4.76 L/S) per person to 5 CFM (2.37 L/S) per person. In cold, warm, humid, or dusty climates, it is preferable to minimize ventilation with outdoor air to conserve energy, cost, or filtration. This critique (e.g. Tiller<ref>Tiller, T.R. 1973. ASHRAE Transactions, v. 79</ref>) led ASHRAE to reduce outdoor ventilation rates in 1981, particularly in non-smoking areas. However subsequent research by Fanger,<ref>Berg-Munch B, Clausen P, Fanger PO. 1984. \"Ventilation requirements for the control of body odor in spaces occupied by women\". Proceedings of the 3rd Int. Conference on Indoor Air Quality, Stockholm, Sweden, V5</ref> W. Cain, and Janssen validated the Yaglou model.

This is compensated in other sections of the standard which require that this minimum amount of air is actually delivered to the breathing zone of the individual occupant at all times. The total outdoor air intake of the ventilation system (in multiple-zone variable air volume (VAV) systems) might therefore be similar to the airflow required by the 1989 standard. <br>\nFrom 1999 to 2010, there was considerable development of the application protocol for ventilation rates. These advancements address occupant- and process-based ventilation rates, room ventilation effectiveness, and system ventilation effectiveness<ref>Stanke, DA. 2007. \"Standard 62.1-2004: Stricter or Not?\" ASHRAE IAQ Applications, Spring 2006. {{cite web|url=http://sspc621.ashraepcs.org/pdf/IAQArticleSpring2006.pdf|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714145759/http://sspc621.ashraepcs.org/pdf/IAQArticleSpring2006.pdf|archivedate=2014-07-14|accessdate=2014-06-12}} accessed 11 June 2014</ref>\n\n== Problems ==\n* In hot, humid climates, unconditioned ventilation air will deliver approximately one pound of water each day for each cfm of outdoor air per day, annual average. This is a great deal of moisture, and it can create serious indoor moisture and mold problems.\n* Ventilation efficiency is determined by design and layout, and is dependent upon placement and proximity of diffusers and return air outlets. If they are located closely together, supply air may mix with stale air, decreasing efficiency of the HVAC system, and creating air quality problems.\n* System imbalances occur when components of the HVAC system are improperly adjusted or installed, and can create pressure differences (too much circulating air creating a draft or too little circulating air creating stagnancy).\n* Cross-contamination occurs when pressure differences arise, forcing potentially contaminated air from one zone to an uncontaminated zone. This often involves undesired odors or VOCs.\n* Re-entry of exhaust air occurs when exhaust outlets and fresh air intakes are either too close, or prevailing winds change exhaust patterns, or by infiltration between intake and exhaust air flows.\n* Entrainment of contaminated outdoor air through intake flows will result in indoor air contamination. There are a variety of contaminated air sources, ranging from industrial effluent to VOCs put off by nearby construction work.<ref>US EPA.

Ventilation is mainly used to control [[indoor air quality]] by diluting and displacing indoor pollutants; it can also be used to control indoor temperature, humidity, and air motion to benefit [[thermal comfort]], satisfaction with other aspects of indoor environment, or other objectives.\n\nThe intentional introduction of outdoor air is usually categorized as either mechanical ventilation, [[natural ventilation]]<ref>Ventilation and Infiltration chapter, Fundamentals volume of the ''ASHRAE Handbook'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, 2005</ref> , or [[mixed-mode ventilation]] (hybrid ventilation).\n\n* Mechanical ventilation is the intentional fan driven flow of outdoor air into a building. Mechanical ventilation systems may include supply fans (which push outdoor air into a building), exhaust fans (which draw air out of building and thereby cause equal ventilation flow into a building), or a combination of both. Mechanical ventilation is often provided by equipment that is also used to heat and cool a space.\n\n* [[Natural ventilation]] is the intentional passive flow of outdoor air into a building through planned openings (such as louvers, doors, and windows). Natural ventilation does not require mechanical systems to move outdoor air. Instead, it relies entirely on passive physical phenomena, such as [[wind pressure]], or the [[stack effect]]. Natural ventilation openings may be fixed, or adjustable.  Adjustable openings may be controlled automatically (automated), controlled by occupants (operable), or a combination of both.\n\n* [[Mixed-mode ventilation]] systems use both mechanical and natural processes. The mechanical and natural components may be used at the same time, or at different times of day, or in different seasons of the year.<ref>de Gids W.F., Jicha M., 2010. \"[http://www.aivc.org/resource/vip-32-hybrid-ventilation Ventilation Information Paper 32: Hybrid Ventilation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117023431/http://www.aivc.org/resource/vip-32-hybrid-ventilation |date=2015-11-17 }}\", Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 2010</ref> Since natural ventilation flow depends on environmental conditions, it may not always provide an appropriate amount of ventilation. In this case, mechanical systems may be used to supplement or regulate the naturally driven flow.\n\nVentilation is typically described as separate from infiltration. \n\n* [[Infiltration (HVAC)|Infiltration]] is the circumstantial flow of air from outdoors to indoors through leaks (unplanned openings) in a [[building envelope]]. When a building design relies on infiltration to maintain indoor air quality, this flow has been referred to as adventitious ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schiavon|first=Stefano|date=2014|title=Adventitious ventilation: a new definition for an old mode?|journal=Indoor Air|language=en|volume=24|issue=6|pages=557\u2013558|doi=10.1111/ina.12155|pmid=25376521|issn=1600-0668}}</ref>\n\nThe design of buildings that promote occupant health and well being requires clear understanding of the ways that ventilation airflow interacts with, dilutes, displaces or introduces pollutants within the occupied space. Although ventilation is an integral component to maintaining good indoor air quality, it may not be satisfactory alone.<ref>''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1, Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA</ref> In scenarios where outdoor pollution would deteriorate indoor air quality, other treatment devices such as filtration may also be necessary. In [[kitchen ventilation]] systems, or for laboratory [[fume hood]]s, the design of effective effluent capture can be more important than the bulk amount of ventilation in a space. More generally, the way that an air distribution system causes ventilation to flow into and out of a space impacts the ability for a particular ventilation rate to remove internally generated pollutants. The ability for a system to reduce pollution in a space is described as its \"ventilation effectiveness\".  However, the overall impacts of ventilation on indoor air quality can depend on more complex factors such as the sources of pollution, and the ways that activities and airflow interact to affect occupant exposure.\n\nAn array of factors related to design and operation of ventilation systems are regulated by various codes and standards.  Standards dealing with the design and operation of ventilation systems for the purpose of achieving acceptable indoor air quality include: ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 62.2, the International Residential Code, the International Mechanical Code, and the [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom#Part F. Ventilation|United Kingdom Building Regulations Part F]].  Other standards focused on energy conservation also impact the design and operation of ventilation systems, including: ASHRAE Standard 90.1, and the International Energy Conservation Code.  \n\nIn many instances, ventilation for indoor air quality is simultaneously beneficial for the control of thermal comfort. At these times, it can be useful to increase the rate of ventilation beyond the minimum required for indoor air quality. Two examples include [[Economizer|air-side economizer]] cooling and [[Ventilative cooling|ventilative]] pre-cooling. In other instances, ventilation for indoor air quality contributes to the need for - and energy use by - mechanical heating and cooling equipment. In hot and humid climates, dehumidification of ventilation air can be a particularly energy intensive process.\n\nVentilation should be considered for its relationship to \"venting\" for appliances and combustion equipment such as [[water heater]]s, furnaces, [[boiler]]s, and wood stoves. Most importantly, the design of building ventilation must be careful to avoid the backdraft of combustion products from \"naturally vented\" appliances into the occupied space. This issue is of greater importance for buildings with more air tight envelopes. To avoid the hazard, many modern combustion appliances utilize \"direct venting\" which draws combustion air directly from outdoors, instead of from the indoor environment.\n\n== Ventilation rates for indoor air quality ==\nThe ventilation rate, for CII buildings, is normally expressed by the volumetric flowrate of outdoor air, introduced to the building.  The typical units used are cubic feet per minute (CFM) or liters per second (L/s).  The ventilation rate can also be expressed on a per person or per unit floor area basis, such as CFM/p or CFM/ft\u00b2, or as ''[[air changes per hour]]'' (ACH).\n\n===Standards for residential buildings===\nFor residential buildings, which mostly rely on [[Infiltration (HVAC)|infiltration]] for meeting their ventilation needs, a common ventilation rate measure is the [[air changes per hour|air change rate]] (or [[air changes per hour]]): the hourly ventilation rate divided by the volume of the space (''I'' or ''ACH''; units of 1/h). During the winter, ACH may range from 0.50 to 0.41 in a tightly air-sealed house to 1.11 to 1.47 in a loosely air-sealed house.<ref>Kavanaugh, Steve. Infiltration and Ventilation In Residential Structures. February 2004</ref>\n\nASHRAE now recommends ventilation rates dependent upon floor area, as a revision to the 62-2001 standard, in which the minimum ACH was 0.35, but no less than 15 CFM/person (7.1 L/s/person). As of 2003, the standard has been changed to 3 CFM/100 sq. ft. (15 l/s/100 sq. m.) plus 7.5 CFM/person (3.5 L/s/person).<ref>{{cite web|title=ASHRAE's First Residential Ventilation Standard|url=http://epb.lbl.gov/Publications/lbnl-54331.pdf|publisher=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]|author=M.H.

It also accounts for potential contaminants that may have no measured limits, or for which no limits are not set (such as formaldehyde offgassing from carpet and furniture).\n\n==Natural ventilation==\n{{Main article|Natural ventilation}}\n[[Natural ventilation]] harnesses naturally available forces to supply and remove air in an enclosed space.

The approach deliver fresh air more directly to the breathing zone and aims to improve air quality of inhaled air. Personalized ventilation provides a much higher ventilation effectiveness than conventional mixing ventilation systems by displacing pollution from the breathing zone far less air volume. Beyond improved air quality benefits, the strategy can also improve occupant's thermal comfort, perceived air quality, and overall satisfaction with the indoor environment. Individual's preferences for temperature and air movement are not equal, and so traditional approaches to homogeneous environmental control have failed to achieve high occupant satisfaction. Techniques such as personalized ventilation facilitate control of a more diverse thermal environment that can improve thermal satisfaction for most occupants.\n\n===Local exhaust ventilation===\nLocal exhaust ventilation addresses the issue of avoiding the contamination of indoor air by specific high-emission sources by capturing airborne contaminants before they are spread into the environment. This can include water vapor control, lavatory bioeffluent control, solvent vapors from industrial processes, and dust from wood- and metal-working machinery. Air can be exhausted through pressurized hoods or through the use of fans and pressurizing a specific area.<ref name=\"osha.gov\">{{cite web |url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10631 |title=Ventilation. - 1926.57 |publisher=Osha.gov |accessdate=2012-11-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202023212/http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10631 |archivedate=2012-12-02 }}</ref><br />A local exhaust system is composed of 5 basic parts\n\n# A hood that captures the contaminant at its source\n# Ducts for transporting the air\n# An air-cleaning device that removes/minimizes the contaminant\n# A fan that moves the air through the system\n# An exhaust stack through which the contaminated air is discharged<ref name=\"osha.gov\" />\n\nIn the UK, the use of LEV systems have regulations set out by the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) which are referred to as the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health ([[COSHH|CoSHH]]). Under CoSHH, legislation is set out to protect users of LEV systems by ensuring that all equipment is tested at least every fourteen months to ensure the LEV systems are performing adequately. All parts of the system must be visually inspected and thoroughly tested and where any parts are found to be defective, the inspector must issue a red label to identify the defective part and the issue.\n\nThe owner of the LEV system must then have the defective parts repaired or replaced before the system can be used.\n\n==Smart Ventilation==\nSmart ventilation is a process to continually adjust the ventilation system in time, and optionally by location, to provide the desired IAQ benefits while minimizing energy consumption, utility bills and other non-IAQ costs (such as thermal discomfort or noise). \nA smart ventilation system adjusts ventilation rates in time or by location in a building to be responsive to one or more of the following: occupancy, outdoor thermal and air quality conditions, electricity grid needs, direct sensing of contaminants, operation of other air moving and air cleaning systems. \nIn addition, smart ventilation systems can provide information to building owners, occupants, and managers on operational energy consumption and indoor air quality as well as signal when systems need maintenance or repair. \nBeing responsive to occupancy means that a smart ventilation system can adjust ventilation depending on demand such as reducing ventilation if the building is unoccupied. \nSmart ventilation can time-shift ventilation to periods when a) indoor-outdoor temperature differences are smaller (and away from peak outdoor temperatures and humidity), b) when indoor-outdoor temperatures are appropriate for ventilative cooling, or c) when outdoor air quality is acceptable. \nBeing responsive to electricity grid needs means providing flexibility to electricity demand (including direct signals from utilities) and integration with electric grid control strategies. \nSmart ventilation systems can have sensors to detect air flow, systems pressures or fan energy use in such a way that systems failures can be detected and repaired, as well as when system components need maintenance, such as filter replacement. <ref>Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC). \"[https://www.aivc.org/resources/faqs/what-smart-ventilation What is smart ventilation?]\", AIVC, 2018</ref>\n\n==Ventilation and combustion==\n\n[[Combustion]] (e.g., [[fireplace]], [[gas heater]], [[candle]], [[oil lamp]], etc.) consumes oxygen while producing carbon dioxide and other unhealthy [[gas]]es and [[smoke]], requiring ventilation air. An open [[chimney]] promotes infiltration (i.e. natural ventilation) because of the negative pressure change induced by the [[buoyant]], warmer air leaving through the chimney. The warm air is typically replaced by heavier, cold air.\n\nVentilation in a structure is also needed for removing [[water vapor]] produced by [[Respiratory system|respiration]], burning, and [[cooking]], and for removing odors. If water vapor is permitted to accumulate, it may damage the structure, [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], or finishes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} When operating, an [[air conditioner]] usually removes excess moisture from the air. A [[dehumidifier]] may also be appropriate for removing airborne moisture.\n\n== Calculation for acceptable ventilation rate ==\nVentilation guidelines are based upon the minimum ventilation rate required to maintain acceptable levels of bioeffluents. Carbon dioxide is used as a reference point, as it is the gas of highest emission at a relatively constant value of 0.005 L/s.

An early method of ventilation was the use of a ventilating fire near an air vent which would forcibly cause the air in the building to circulate. English engineer [[John Theophilus Desaguliers]] provided an early example of this, when he installed ventilating fires in the air tubes on the roof of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. Starting with the [[Covent Garden Theatre]], gas burning [[chandelier]]s on the ceiling were often specially designed to perform a ventilating role.\n\n===Mechanical systems===\nA more sophisticated system involving the use of mechanical equipment to circulate the air was developed in the mid 19th century. A basic system of [[bellows]] was put in place to ventilate [[Newgate Prison]] and outlying buildings, by the engineer [[Stephen Hales]] in the mid-1700s. The problem with these early devices was that they required constant human labour to operate. [[David Boswell Reid]] was called to testify before a Parliamentary committee on proposed architectural designs for the new [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], after the old one burned down in a fire in 1834.<ref name=\"Porter\">{{cite book |first=Dale H. |last=Porter |title=The Life and Times of Sir Goldsworthy Gurney: Gentleman scientist and inventor, 1793\u20131875 |year=1998|pages=177&ndash;179 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ta3d0qWpPMsC&pg=PA177 |publisher=Associated University Presses, Inc. |isbn=0-934223-50-5}}</ref> In January 1840 Reid was appointed by the committee for the [[House of Lords]] dealing with the construction of the replacement for the Houses of Parliament.

Early hypotheses included excess concentrations of CO2 and [[oxygen depletion]]. However, by the late 1800s, scientists thought biological contamination, not oxygen or CO2, as the primary component of unacceptable indoor air. However, it was noted as early as 1872 that CO2 concentration closely correlates to perceived air quality.\n\nThe first estimate of minimum ventilation rates was developed by Tredgold in 1836.<ref>Tredgold, T. 1836. \"The Principles of Warming and Ventilation - Public Buildings\". London: M. Taylor</ref> This was followed by subsequent studies on the topic by Billings <ref>Billings, J.S. 1886. \"The principles of ventilation and heating and their practical application 2d ed., with corrections\" {{cite book|title=Archived copy|ol = 22096429M}}</ref> in 1886 and Flugge in 1905.  The recommendations of Billings and Flugge were incorporated into numerous building codes from 1900-1920s, and published as an industry standard by ASHVE (the predecessor to [[ASHRAE]]) in 1914.<ref name=\"Janssen\" />\n\nStudy continued into the varied effects of [[thermal comfort]], oxygen, carbon dioxide, and biological contaminants. Research was conducted with humans subjects controlled test chambers. Two studies, published between 1909 and 1911, showed that carbon dioxide was not the offending component. Subjects remained satisfied in chambers with high levels of CO2, so long as the chamber remained cool.<ref name=\"Janssen\" /> (Subsequently, it has been determined that CO2 is, in fact, harmful at concentrations over 50,000ppm<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/124389.html|title=CDC - Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH): Carbon dioxide - NIOSH Publications and Products|date=1 November 2017|website=www.cdc.gov|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420005202/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/124389.html|archivedate=20 April 2018|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>)\n\nASHVE began a robust research effort in 1919. By 1935, ASHVE funded research conducted by Lemberg, Brandt, and Morse - again using human subjects in test chambers - suggested the primary component of \"bad air\" was odor, perceived by the human olfactory nerves.<ref>Lemberg WH, Brandt AD, and Morse, K. 1935. \"A laboratory study of minimum ventilation requirements: ventilation box experiments\". ASHVE Transactions, V. 41</ref> Human response to odor was found to be logarithmic to contaminant concentrations, and related to temperature. At lower, more comfortable temperatures, lower ventilation rates were satisfactory.  A 1936 human test chamber study by Yaglou, Riley, and Coggins culminated much of this effort, considering odor, room volume, occupant age, cooling equipment effects, and recirculated air implications, which provided guidance for ventilation rates.<ref>Yaglou CPE, Riley C, and Coggins DI. 1936. \"Ventilation Requirements\" ASHVE Transactions, v.32</ref> The Yaglou research has been validated, and adopted into industry standards, beginning with the ASA code in 1946. From this research base, [[ASHRAE]] (having replaced ASHVE) developed space by space recommendations, and published them as ASHRAE Standard 62-1975: Ventilation for acceptable indoor air quality.\n\nAs more architecture incorporated mechanical ventilation, the cost of outdoor air ventilation came under some scrutiny. In 1973, in response to the [[1973 oil crisis]] and conservation concerns, ASHRAE Standards 62-73 and 62-81) reduced required ventilation from 10 CFM (4.76 L/S) per person to 5 CFM (2.37 L/S) per person. In cold, warm, humid, or dusty climates, it is preferable to minimize ventilation with outdoor air to conserve energy, cost, or filtration. This critique (e.g. Tiller<ref>Tiller, T.R. 1973. ASHRAE Transactions, v. 79</ref>) led ASHRAE to reduce outdoor ventilation rates in 1981, particularly in non-smoking areas. However subsequent research by Fanger,<ref>Berg-Munch B, Clausen P, Fanger PO. 1984. \"Ventilation requirements for the control of body odor in spaces occupied by women\". Proceedings of the 3rd Int. Conference on Indoor Air Quality, Stockholm, Sweden, V5</ref> W. Cain, and Janssen validated the Yaglou model. The reduced ventilation rates was found to be a contributing factor to [[sick building syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Joshi|first1=SM|title=The sick building syndrome|journal=Indian J Occup Environ Med|volume=12|issue=2|pages=61\u20134|doi=10.4103/0019-5278.43262|pmc=2796751|pmid=20040980|year=2008}} in section 3 \"Inadequate ventilation\"</ref>  \n{{anchor |Historical Ventilation Rates|Historical}}\n\nThe 1989 ASHRAE standard (Standard 62-89) states that appropriate ventilation guidelines are 20 CFM (9.2 L/s) per person in an office building, and 15 CFM (7.1 L/s) per person for schools, while the 2004 Standard 62.1-2004 has lower recommendations again (see tables below).

This is a great deal of moisture, and it can create serious indoor moisture and mold problems.\n* Ventilation efficiency is determined by design and layout, and is dependent upon placement and proximity of diffusers and return air outlets. If they are located closely together, supply air may mix with stale air, decreasing efficiency of the HVAC system, and creating air quality problems.\n* System imbalances occur when components of the HVAC system are improperly adjusted or installed, and can create pressure differences (too much circulating air creating a draft or too little circulating air creating stagnancy).\n* Cross-contamination occurs when pressure differences arise, forcing potentially contaminated air from one zone to an uncontaminated zone. This often involves undesired odors or VOCs.\n* Re-entry of exhaust air occurs when exhaust outlets and fresh air intakes are either too close, or prevailing winds change exhaust patterns, or by infiltration between intake and exhaust air flows.\n* Entrainment of contaminated outdoor air through intake flows will result in indoor air contamination.
