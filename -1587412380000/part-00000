Its Trus-Dek roof system, constructed in 1975, uses natural [[wood]] arches to span {{convert|400|ft|0}} at a height of {{convert|150|ft|0}} over the field's hashmarks. Built when Idaho was a member of the [[Big Sky Conference]] in all sports including football, the Kibbie Dome was long the smallest stadium in Division I [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] football.\n\nPreviously on this site was [[Neale Stadium]], which opened in [[1937 Idaho Vandals football team|1937]] as an earthen [[horseshoe]] with wooden sideline grandstands. After 32 seasons, its bleachers were condemned for structural inadequacies due to erosion in the summer of [[1969 Idaho Vandals football team|1969]]. After an idle 1969 football season, it was destroyed (by suspected [[arson]]) on November 22, 1969. After two years away at nearby [[Rogers Field (Washington State)|Rogers Field]] in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]], the new outdoor \"Idaho Stadium\" opened on October 9, [[1971 Idaho Vandals football team|1971]], with [[concrete]] grandstands; the Vandals responded with a victory over [[Idaho State Bengals football|Idaho State]], an 8-3 season, and the [[Big Sky Conference|Big Sky]] title.\n\nTartan Turf, similar to [[AstroTurf]], was installed in [[1972 Idaho Vandals football team|1972]] with the roll-up mechanism; the arched roof and vertical end walls were completed in time for the [[1975 Idaho Vandals football team|1975]] home opener on September 27, enclosing the stadium to become the [[Kibbie Dome]]. The [[seating capacity]] is 16,000 for football games, 7,000 for basketball games (in a configuration known as the \"Cowan Spectrum\" since 2001), and 7,500 for concerts. Its innovative roof won the Outstanding Structural Engineering Achievement award from the [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] in 1976.\n\nThe original Tartan Turf was replaced with AstroTurf in [[1990 Idaho Vandals football team|1990]] and lasted until [[2007 Idaho Vandals football team|2007]], when it was replaced with \"Real Grass Pro,\" an infilled synthetic turf (similar to [[FieldTurf]]).

Its Trus-Dek roof system, constructed in 1975, uses natural [[wood]] arches to span {{convert|400|ft|0}} at a height of {{convert|150|ft|0}} over the field's hashmarks. Built when Idaho was a member of the [[Big Sky Conference]] in all sports including football, the Kibbie Dome was long the smallest stadium in Division I [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] football.\n\nPreviously on this site was [[Neale Stadium]], which opened in [[1937 Idaho Vandals football team|1937]] as an earthen [[horseshoe]] with wooden sideline grandstands. After 32 seasons, its bleachers were condemned for structural inadequacies due to erosion in the summer of [[1969 Idaho Vandals football team|1969]]. After an idle 1969 football season, it was destroyed (by suspected [[arson]]) on November 22, 1969. After two years away at nearby [[Rogers Field (Washington State)|Rogers Field]] in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]], the new outdoor \"Idaho Stadium\" opened on October 9, [[1971 Idaho Vandals football team|1971]], with [[concrete]] grandstands; the Vandals responded with a victory over [[Idaho State Bengals football|Idaho State]], an 8-3 season, and the [[Big Sky Conference|Big Sky]] title.\n\nTartan Turf, similar to [[AstroTurf]], was installed in [[1972 Idaho Vandals football team|1972]] with the roll-up mechanism; the arched roof and vertical end walls were completed in time for the [[1975 Idaho Vandals football team|1975]] home opener on September 27, enclosing the stadium to become the [[Kibbie Dome]]. The [[seating capacity]] is 16,000 for football games, 7,000 for basketball games (in a configuration known as the \"Cowan Spectrum\" since 2001), and 7,500 for concerts. Its innovative roof won the Outstanding Structural Engineering Achievement award from the [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] in 1976.\n\nThe original Tartan Turf was replaced with AstroTurf in [[1990 Idaho Vandals football team|1990]] and lasted until [[2007 Idaho Vandals football team|2007]], when it was replaced with \"Real Grass Pro,\" an infilled synthetic turf (similar to [[FieldTurf]]).

His father, a clothes presser and part-time [[hazzan|cantor]], struggled to make a living and to provide even marginal comfort for his small family. When Garfield was five, his brother Max was born. Their mother never fully recovered from what was described as a \"difficult\" pregnancy and birth. She died two years later, and the young boys were sent to live with various relatives, all poor, scattered across the [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs]] of [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]] and [[The Bronx]]. Several of these relatives lived in tenements in a section of East Brooklyn called [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]], and there, Garfield lived in one house and slept in another. At school, he was judged a poor reader and speller, deficits that were aggravated by irregular attendance.

At this time, people started to notice his ability to mimic well-known performers, both physically and facially. He also began to hang out and eventually spar at a boxing gym on [[Jerome Avenue]]. At some point, he contracted [[scarlet fever]] (it was diagnosed later in adulthood), causing permanent damage to his heart and causing him to miss a lot of school. After he was expelled three times and expressed a wish to quit school altogether, his father and step-mother sent him to P.S. 45, a school for difficult children. It was under the guidance of the school's principal\u2014the educator [[Angelo Patri]]\u2014that he was introduced to acting.<ref name=Beaver/> Noticing Garfield's tendency to stammer, Patri assigned him to a speech therapy class taught by a charismatic teacher named Margaret O'Ryan. She gave him acting exercises and made him memorize and deliver speeches in front of the class and, as he progressed, in front of school assemblies. O'Ryan thought he had natural talent and cast him in school plays. She encouraged him to sign up for a citywide debating competition sponsored by ''[[The New York Times]]''. To his own surprise, he took second prize.\n\nWith Patri and O'Ryan's encouragement, he began to take acting lessons at a drama school that was part of [[The Heckscher Foundation for Children|The Heckscher Foundation]] and began to appear in their productions. At one of the latter, he received back-stage congratulations and an offer of support from the Yiddish actor [[Jacob Ben-Ami]], who recommended him to the [[American Laboratory Theatre]].<ref>{{cite book |last=McGrath |first=Patrick J. |title=John Garfield: The Illustrated Career in Films and on Stage |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtIarL3_y5YC&pg=PA5 |accessdate=May 16, 2016 |date=January 1, 1993 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0899508672 |page=5}}</ref> Funded by the [[Theatre Guild]], \"the Lab\" had contracted with [[Richard Boleslavski]] to stage its experimental productions and with Russian actress and expatriate [[Maria Ouspenskaya]] to supervise classes in acting. Former members of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]], they were the first proponents of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] in the United States, which soon developed into what came to be known as \"[[Method acting|the Method]].\" Garfield took morning classes and began volunteering time at the Lab after hours, auditing rehearsals, building and painting scenery, and doing crew work. He would later view this time as beginning his apprenticeship in the theater. Among the people becoming disenchanted with the Guild and turning to the Lab for a more radical, challenging environment were [[Stella Adler]], [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Franchot Tone]], [[Cheryl Crawford]] and [[Harold Clurman]]. In varying degrees, all would become influential in Garfield's later career.\n\nAfter a stint with [[Eva Le Gallienne]]'s Civic Repertory Theater and a short period of vagrancy, involving hitchhiking, freight hopping, picking fruit, and logging in the Pacific Northwest ([[Preston Sturges]] conceived the film ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'' after hearing Garfield tell of his hobo adventures)<ref name=Swindell/> Garfield made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1932 in a play called ''Lost Boy''. It ran for only two weeks, but gave Garfield something critically important for an actor struggling to break into the theater: a credit.\n\nThere is a claim that he was a patron of [[Polly Adler]]'s [[bordello]] or brothel in New York.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/carnalknowledgeb00baxt| url-access=registration| title=Carnal Knowledge: Baxter's Concise Encyclopedia of Modern Sex| last=Baxter| first=John| date=10 February 2009| publisher=HarperCollins| isbn=978-0-06-087434-6| page=[https://archive.org/details/carnalknowledgeb00baxt/page/3 3]| access-date=28 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==New York theater and the Group==\n[[File:John Garfield WB publicity still.jpg|thumb|Warner Bros. publicity photo, c. late 1930s]]\nGarfield received feature billing in his next role, that of Henry the office boy in [[Elmer Rice]]'s play ''Counsellor-at-Law'', starring [[Paul Muni]]. The play ran for three months, made an eastern tour and returned for an unprecedented second, repeat engagement, only closing when Muni was contractually compelled to go back to Hollywood to make a film for Warners. At this point, Warner's expressed an interest in Garfield and sought a [[screen test]]. He turned them down.\n\nGarfield's former colleagues Crawford, Clurman and Strasberg had begun a new theater collective, calling it simply \"[[Group Theatre (New York)|the Group]],\" and Garfield lobbied his friends hard to get in. After months of rejection, he began frequenting the inside steps of the [[Broadhurst Theater]] where the Group had its offices. Cheryl Crawford noticed him one day and greeted him warmly. Feeling encouraged, he made his request for apprenticeship. Something intangible impressed her, and she recommended him to the other directors. They made no objection.\n\n[[Clifford Odets]] had been a close friend of Garfield from the early days in the Bronx. After Odets' one-act play ''[[Waiting for Lefty]]'' became a surprise hit, the Group announced it would mount a production of his full-length drama ''[[Awake and Sing]]''. At the playwright's insistence, Garfield was cast as Ralph, the sensitive young son who pleads for \"a chance to get to first base.\" The play opened in February 1935, and Garfield was singled out by critic [[Brooks Atkinson]] for having a \"splendid sense of character development.\" Garfield's apprenticeship was officially over; he was voted full membership by the company. Odets was the man of the moment, and he claimed to the press that Garfield was his \"find\" and that he would soon write a play just for him. That play would turn out to be ''[[Golden Boy (play)|Golden Boy]]'', but when [[Luther Adler]] was cast in the lead role instead, a disillusioned Garfield began to take a second look at the overtures being made by [[Hollywood]].<ref name=Nott/>\n\n==Warner Bros.==\nGarfield had been approached by Hollywood studios before\u2014both [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and Warners offering screen tests\u2014but talks had always stalled over a clause he wanted inserted in his contract, one that would allow him time off for stage work. Now Warner Bros. acceded to his demand, and Garfield signed a standard feature-player agreement\u2014seven years with options\u2014in Warner's New York office.<ref>The \"option\" gave the studio the right to drop the performer after every six-month period.</ref> Many in the Group were livid over what they considered his betrayal. [[Elia Kazan]]'s reaction was different, suggesting that the Group did not so much fear that Garfield would fail, but that he would succeed.<ref name=Swindell/> [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]]'s first order of business was a change of name to John Garfield.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:John Garfield - Lost Men - 1940.jpg|thumb|left|240px|in ''Blackwell's Island'' (1940)]] -->\nAfter many false starts, he was finally cast in a supporting, yet crucial role as a tragic young composer in a [[Michael Curtiz]] film titled ''[[Four Daughters]]'' (1938). After the picture's release, he received very positive notices and a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. The studio quickly revised Garfield's contract\u2014designating him a star player rather than a featured one\u2014for seven years without options. They also created a name-above-the-title vehicle for him titled ''[[They Made Me a Criminal]]'' (1939). Before the success of ''Daughters'', Garfield had made a [[B movie]] feature called ''[[Blackwell's Island (film)|Blackwell's Island]]'' (also 1939). Not wanting their new star to appear in a low-budget film, Warners ordered an A movie upgrade by adding $100,000 to its budget and recalling director Michael Curtiz to shoot newly scripted scenes.\n\nGarfield's debut had a cinematic impact difficult to conceive in retrospect. As biographer Lawrence Swindell put it: {{blockquote|Garfield's work was spontaneous, non-actory; it had abandon. He didn't recite dialogue, he attacked it until it lost the quality of talk and took on the nature of speech... Like [[James Cagney|Cagney]], he was an exceptionally mobile performer from the start of his screen career. These traits were orchestrated with his physical appearance to create a screen ''persona'' innately powerful in the sexual sense. What Warners saw immediately was that Garfield's impact was felt by both sexes. This was almost unique.<ref name=Swindell/>}}\n\n[[File:John Garfield in Gentleman's Agreement trailer.jpg|thumb|in ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' (1947)]]\nHis \"honeymoon\" with Warners over, Garfield entered a protracted period of conflict with the studio, with Warners attempting to cast him in crowd-pleasing melodramas like ''[[Dust Be My Destiny]]'' (also 1939) and Garfield insisting on quality scripts that would offer challenges and highlight his versatility. The result was often a series of suspensions, with Garfield refusing an assigned role and Warners refusing to pay him. Garfield's problem was shared by any actor working in the studio system of the 1930s: by contract, the studio had the right to cast him in any project they wanted to. But, as Robert Nott explains: \n{{blockquote|To be fair, most of the studios had a team of producers, directors, and writers who could pinpoint a particular star's strengths and worked to capitalize on those strengths in terms of finding vehicles that would appeal to the public\u2014and hence make the studio money. The forces that prevented him from getting high quality roles were really the result of the combined willpower of the Warner Bros., the studio system in general, and the general public, which also had its own perception of how Garfield (or Cagney or Bogart for that matter) should appear on screen.<ref name=Gould>{{cite web| last=Gould| first=Mark R.| title=John Garfield, Film Noir and the Hollywood Blacklist| url=http://atyourlibrary.org/john-garfield-film-noir-and-hollywood-blacklist| work=He Ran All The Way: The Life of John Garfield| publisher=@yourlibrary| accessdate=September 13, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402111521/http://atyourlibrary.org/john-garfield-film-noir-and-hollywood-blacklist| archive-date=April 2, 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n\nA notable exception to this trend was ''[[Daughters Courageous]]'' (also 1939), a not-quite-sequel (same cast, different story and characters) to his debut film. The film did well critically, but failed to find an audience, the public being dissatisfied that it was not a true sequel (hard to pull off, since the original character Mickey Borden died in the first picture). The director, Curtiz, called the film \"my obscure masterpiece.\"<ref name=Swindell/>\n\nAt the onset of [[World War II]], Garfield immediately attempted to enlist in the armed forces, but was turned down because of his heart condition.<ref name=Nott/>  Frustrated, he turned his energies to supporting the war effort. He and actress [[Bette Davis]] were the driving forces behind the opening of the [[Hollywood Canteen]], a club offering food and entertainment for American [[United States military|servicemen]]. He traveled overseas to help entertain the troops, made several [[War bond#World War II|bond selling tours]] and starred in a string of patriotic box-office successes like ''[[Air Force (film)|Air Force]]'', ''[[Destination Tokyo]]'' (both 1943) and ''[[Pride of the Marines]]'' (1945). He was particularly proud of the last film, based on the life of [[Al Schmid]], a war hero blinded in combat. In preparing for the role, Garfield lived for several weeks with Schmid and his wife in Philadelphia and would blindfold himself for hours at a time.\n\nAfter the war, Garfield starred in a series of successful films such as ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (1946) with [[Lana Turner]], ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (also 1946) with [[Joan Crawford]], and ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' (1947), an Oscar-winning Best Picture. In ''Gentleman's Agreement'', Garfield took a featured, but supporting, part because he believed deeply in the film's expos\u00e9 of [[antisemitism]] in America. He was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his starring role in ''[[Body and Soul (1947 film)|Body and Soul]]'' (1947). That same year, Garfield returned to Broadway in the play ''Skipper Next to God''. Strong-willed and often verbally combative, Garfield did not hesitate to venture out on his own when the opportunity arose. In 1946, when his contract with [[Warner Bros.]] expired, Garfield decided not to renew it and opted to start his own independent production company, one of the first Hollywood stars to take this step.\n\n==The Red Scare==\n{{Quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#ACE1AF |align=right |quote=\"I have nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed of.

He supported the [[Committee for the First Amendment]], which opposed governmental investigation of Communist activity in Hollywood. When called to testify, in 1951, before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], which was empowered to investigate communist infiltration in America, Garfield refused to name communist party members or followers, testifying that, indeed, he knew none in the film industry. Garfield rejected communism, and just prior to his death in hopes of redeeming himself in the eyes of the blacklisters, wrote that he had been duped by communist ideology in an unpublished article called \"I Was a Sucker for a Left Hook\", a reference to Garfield's movies about boxing.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Bernstein| first1=Walter| title=Inside Out: A Memoir of the Blacklist| date=31 July 2013| publisher=Random House| location=New York| isbn=978-0-8041-5048-4| pages=304| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XwBAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT220| accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref> However, his forced testimony before the committee had severely damaged his reputation. He was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] in ''[[Red Channels]]'', and barred from future employment as an actor by Hollywood [[movie studio]] bosses for the remainder of his career.<ref name=Beaver/>\n\nWith film work scarce because of the blacklist, Garfield returned to Broadway and starred in a 1952 revival of ''[[Golden Boy (play)|Golden Boy]]'', finally being cast in the lead role denied him years before.\n\n==Death==\n[[Image:Garfield 800.jpg|thumb|200px|John Garfield's grave in [[Westchester Hills Cemetery]]]]\n[[File:John Garfield Footstone 2007.JPG|thumb|left|John Garfield's footstone]]\nOn May 9, 1952, Garfield moved out of his New York apartment for the last time, indicating to friends that the separation from his wife Roberta was not temporary. He confided to columnist [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] that he would soon be divorced. Close friends speculated that it was his wife's opposition to his planned confession in ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine that triggered the separation. He heard that a HUAC investigator was reviewing his testimony for possible perjury charges. His agent reported that [[20th Century Fox|20th Century-Fox]] wanted him for a film called ''Taxi'', but would not even begin talks unless the investigation concluded in his favor. Three actor friends, [[Canada Lee]], [[Mady Christians]] and [[J. Edward Bromberg]], had all recently died after being listed by the committee.<ref name=Swindell/>\n\nIn the morning of May 20, Garfield, against his doctor's strict orders, played several strenuous sets of tennis with a friend, mentioning the fact that he had not been to bed the night before. He met actress Iris Whitney for dinner, and afterward became suddenly ill complaining that he felt chilled. She took him to her apartment, where he refused to let her call a doctor and instead went to bed. The next morning, she found him dead. Long-term heart problems, allegedly aggravated by the stress of his blacklisting, had led to his death at the age of 39.<ref>{{cite journal| first1=William| last1=Pechter| first2=Abraham| last2=Polonsky| title=Abraham Polonsky and \"Force of Evil\"| url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1210628?seq=1| journal=Film Quarterly| volume=15| number=3| date=Spring 1962| page=53| quote=(Pechter interviewing Polonsky): \"It has been suggested that John Garfield's political difficulties and debarment from Hollywood work was a considerable influence in accelerating his early death.

His father, a clothes presser and part-time [[hazzan|cantor]], struggled to make a living and to provide even marginal comfort for his small family. When Garfield was five, his brother Max was born. Their mother never fully recovered from what was described as a \"difficult\" pregnancy and birth. She died two years later, and the young boys were sent to live with various relatives, all poor, scattered across the [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs]] of [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]] and [[The Bronx]]. Several of these relatives lived in tenements in a section of East Brooklyn called [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]], and there, Garfield lived in one house and slept in another. At school, he was judged a poor reader and speller, deficits that were aggravated by irregular attendance. He would later say of his time on the streets there, that he learned \"all the meanness, all the toughness it's possible for kids to acquire.\"<ref name=Swindell>{{cite book| last=Swindell| first=Larry| title=Body and Soul| year=1975| publisher=William Morrow and Company| location=New York| isbn=978-0688029074| page=6| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdlZAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#ACE1AF |align=right |quote=\"If I hadn't become an actor, I might have become Public Enemy Number One.\"<ref name=\"Swindell\" />|salign=right}}\nHis father remarried and moved to the [[West Bronx]], where Garfield joined a series of gangs. Much later, he would recall: \"Every street had its own gang. That's the way it was in poor sections... the old safety in numbers.\" He soon became a gang leader. At this time, people started to notice his ability to mimic well-known performers, both physically and facially. He also began to hang out and eventually spar at a boxing gym on [[Jerome Avenue]]. At some point, he contracted [[scarlet fever]] (it was diagnosed later in adulthood), causing permanent damage to his heart and causing him to miss a lot of school. After he was expelled three times and expressed a wish to quit school altogether, his father and step-mother sent him to P.S. 45, a school for difficult children. It was under the guidance of the school's principal\u2014the educator [[Angelo Patri]]\u2014that he was introduced to acting.<ref name=Beaver/> Noticing Garfield's tendency to stammer, Patri assigned him to a speech therapy class taught by a charismatic teacher named Margaret O'Ryan. She gave him acting exercises and made him memorize and deliver speeches in front of the class and, as he progressed, in front of school assemblies. O'Ryan thought he had natural talent and cast him in school plays. She encouraged him to sign up for a citywide debating competition sponsored by ''[[The New York Times]]''. To his own surprise, he took second prize.\n\nWith Patri and O'Ryan's encouragement, he began to take acting lessons at a drama school that was part of [[The Heckscher Foundation for Children|The Heckscher Foundation]] and began to appear in their productions. At one of the latter, he received back-stage congratulations and an offer of support from the Yiddish actor [[Jacob Ben-Ami]], who recommended him to the [[American Laboratory Theatre]].<ref>{{cite book |last=McGrath |first=Patrick J. |title=John Garfield: The Illustrated Career in Films and on Stage |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtIarL3_y5YC&pg=PA5 |accessdate=May 16, 2016 |date=January 1, 1993 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0899508672 |page=5}}</ref> Funded by the [[Theatre Guild]], \"the Lab\" had contracted with [[Richard Boleslavski]] to stage its experimental productions and with Russian actress and expatriate [[Maria Ouspenskaya]] to supervise classes in acting. Former members of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]], they were the first proponents of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] in the United States, which soon developed into what came to be known as \"[[Method acting|the Method]].\" Garfield took morning classes and began volunteering time at the Lab after hours, auditing rehearsals, building and painting scenery, and doing crew work. He would later view this time as beginning his apprenticeship in the theater. Among the people becoming disenchanted with the Guild and turning to the Lab for a more radical, challenging environment were [[Stella Adler]], [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Franchot Tone]], [[Cheryl Crawford]] and [[Harold Clurman]]. In varying degrees, all would become influential in Garfield's later career.\n\nAfter a stint with [[Eva Le Gallienne]]'s Civic Repertory Theater and a short period of vagrancy, involving hitchhiking, freight hopping, picking fruit, and logging in the Pacific Northwest ([[Preston Sturges]] conceived the film ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'' after hearing Garfield tell of his hobo adventures)<ref name=Swindell/> Garfield made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1932 in a play called ''Lost Boy''. It ran for only two weeks, but gave Garfield something critically important for an actor struggling to break into the theater: a credit.\n\nThere is a claim that he was a patron of [[Polly Adler]]'s [[bordello]] or brothel in New York.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/carnalknowledgeb00baxt| url-access=registration| title=Carnal Knowledge: Baxter's Concise Encyclopedia of Modern Sex| last=Baxter| first=John| date=10 February 2009| publisher=HarperCollins| isbn=978-0-06-087434-6| page=[https://archive.org/details/carnalknowledgeb00baxt/page/3 3]| access-date=28 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==New York theater and the Group==\n[[File:John Garfield WB publicity still.jpg|thumb|Warner Bros. publicity photo, c. late 1930s]]\nGarfield received feature billing in his next role, that of Henry the office boy in [[Elmer Rice]]'s play ''Counsellor-at-Law'', starring [[Paul Muni]]. The play ran for three months, made an eastern tour and returned for an unprecedented second, repeat engagement, only closing when Muni was contractually compelled to go back to Hollywood to make a film for Warners. At this point, Warner's expressed an interest in Garfield and sought a [[screen test]]. He turned them down.\n\nGarfield's former colleagues Crawford, Clurman and Strasberg had begun a new theater collective, calling it simply \"[[Group Theatre (New York)|the Group]],\" and Garfield lobbied his friends hard to get in. After months of rejection, he began frequenting the inside steps of the [[Broadhurst Theater]] where the Group had its offices. Cheryl Crawford noticed him one day and greeted him warmly. Feeling encouraged, he made his request for apprenticeship. Something intangible impressed her, and she recommended him to the other directors. They made no objection.\n\n[[Clifford Odets]] had been a close friend of Garfield from the early days in the Bronx. After Odets' one-act play ''[[Waiting for Lefty]]'' became a surprise hit, the Group announced it would mount a production of his full-length drama ''[[Awake and Sing]]''. At the playwright's insistence, Garfield was cast as Ralph, the sensitive young son who pleads for \"a chance to get to first base.\" The play opened in February 1935, and Garfield was singled out by critic [[Brooks Atkinson]] for having a \"splendid sense of character development.\" Garfield's apprenticeship was officially over; he was voted full membership by the company. Odets was the man of the moment, and he claimed to the press that Garfield was his \"find\" and that he would soon write a play just for him. That play would turn out to be ''[[Golden Boy (play)|Golden Boy]]'', but when [[Luther Adler]] was cast in the lead role instead, a disillusioned Garfield began to take a second look at the overtures being made by [[Hollywood]].<ref name=Nott/>\n\n==Warner Bros.==\nGarfield had been approached by Hollywood studios before\u2014both [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and Warners offering screen tests\u2014but talks had always stalled over a clause he wanted inserted in his contract, one that would allow him time off for stage work. Now Warner Bros. acceded to his demand, and Garfield signed a standard feature-player agreement\u2014seven years with options\u2014in Warner's New York office.<ref>The \"option\" gave the studio the right to drop the performer after every six-month period.</ref> Many in the Group were livid over what they considered his betrayal. [[Elia Kazan]]'s reaction was different, suggesting that the Group did not so much fear that Garfield would fail, but that he would succeed.<ref name=Swindell/> [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]]'s first order of business was a change of name to John Garfield.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:John Garfield - Lost Men - 1940.jpg|thumb|left|240px|in ''Blackwell's Island'' (1940)]] -->\nAfter many false starts, he was finally cast in a supporting, yet crucial role as a tragic young composer in a [[Michael Curtiz]] film titled ''[[Four Daughters]]'' (1938). After the picture's release, he received very positive notices and a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. The studio quickly revised Garfield's contract\u2014designating him a star player rather than a featured one\u2014for seven years without options. They also created a name-above-the-title vehicle for him titled ''[[They Made Me a Criminal]]'' (1939). Before the success of ''Daughters'', Garfield had made a [[B movie]] feature called ''[[Blackwell's Island (film)|Blackwell's Island]]'' (also 1939). Not wanting their new star to appear in a low-budget film, Warners ordered an A movie upgrade by adding $100,000 to its budget and recalling director Michael Curtiz to shoot newly scripted scenes.\n\nGarfield's debut had a cinematic impact difficult to conceive in retrospect. As biographer Lawrence Swindell put it: {{blockquote|Garfield's work was spontaneous, non-actory; it had abandon. He didn't recite dialogue, he attacked it until it lost the quality of talk and took on the nature of speech... Like [[James Cagney|Cagney]], he was an exceptionally mobile performer from the start of his screen career. These traits were orchestrated with his physical appearance to create a screen ''persona'' innately powerful in the sexual sense. What Warners saw immediately was that Garfield's impact was felt by both sexes. This was almost unique.<ref name=Swindell/>}}\n\n[[File:John Garfield in Gentleman's Agreement trailer.jpg|thumb|in ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' (1947)]]\nHis \"honeymoon\" with Warners over, Garfield entered a protracted period of conflict with the studio, with Warners attempting to cast him in crowd-pleasing melodramas like ''[[Dust Be My Destiny]]'' (also 1939) and Garfield insisting on quality scripts that would offer challenges and highlight his versatility. The result was often a series of suspensions, with Garfield refusing an assigned role and Warners refusing to pay him. Garfield's problem was shared by any actor working in the studio system of the 1930s: by contract, the studio had the right to cast him in any project they wanted to. But, as Robert Nott explains: \n{{blockquote|To be fair, most of the studios had a team of producers, directors, and writers who could pinpoint a particular star's strengths and worked to capitalize on those strengths in terms of finding vehicles that would appeal to the public\u2014and hence make the studio money. The forces that prevented him from getting high quality roles were really the result of the combined willpower of the Warner Bros., the studio system in general, and the general public, which also had its own perception of how Garfield (or Cagney or Bogart for that matter) should appear on screen.<ref name=Gould>{{cite web| last=Gould| first=Mark R.| title=John Garfield, Film Noir and the Hollywood Blacklist| url=http://atyourlibrary.org/john-garfield-film-noir-and-hollywood-blacklist| work=He Ran All The Way: The Life of John Garfield| publisher=@yourlibrary| accessdate=September 13, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402111521/http://atyourlibrary.org/john-garfield-film-noir-and-hollywood-blacklist| archive-date=April 2, 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n\nA notable exception to this trend was ''[[Daughters Courageous]]'' (also 1939), a not-quite-sequel (same cast, different story and characters) to his debut film. The film did well critically, but failed to find an audience, the public being dissatisfied that it was not a true sequel (hard to pull off, since the original character Mickey Borden died in the first picture). The director, Curtiz, called the film \"my obscure masterpiece.\"<ref name=Swindell/>\n\nAt the onset of [[World War II]], Garfield immediately attempted to enlist in the armed forces, but was turned down because of his heart condition.<ref name=Nott/>  Frustrated, he turned his energies to supporting the war effort. He and actress [[Bette Davis]] were the driving forces behind the opening of the [[Hollywood Canteen]], a club offering food and entertainment for American [[United States military|servicemen]]. He traveled overseas to help entertain the troops, made several [[War bond#World War II|bond selling tours]] and starred in a string of patriotic box-office successes like ''[[Air Force (film)|Air Force]]'', ''[[Destination Tokyo]]'' (both 1943) and ''[[Pride of the Marines]]'' (1945). He was particularly proud of the last film, based on the life of [[Al Schmid]], a war hero blinded in combat. In preparing for the role, Garfield lived for several weeks with Schmid and his wife in Philadelphia and would blindfold himself for hours at a time.\n\nAfter the war, Garfield starred in a series of successful films such as ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (1946) with [[Lana Turner]], ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (also 1946) with [[Joan Crawford]], and ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' (1947), an Oscar-winning Best Picture. In ''Gentleman's Agreement'', Garfield took a featured, but supporting, part because he believed deeply in the film's expos\u00e9 of [[antisemitism]] in America. He was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his starring role in ''[[Body and Soul (1947 film)|Body and Soul]]'' (1947). That same year, Garfield returned to Broadway in the play ''Skipper Next to God''. Strong-willed and often verbally combative, Garfield did not hesitate to venture out on his own when the opportunity arose. In 1946, when his contract with [[Warner Bros.]] expired, Garfield decided not to renew it and opted to start his own independent production company, one of the first Hollywood stars to take this step.\n\n==The Red Scare==\n{{Quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#ACE1AF |align=right |quote=\"I have nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed of.

He supported the [[Committee for the First Amendment]], which opposed governmental investigation of Communist activity in Hollywood. When called to testify, in 1951, before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], which was empowered to investigate communist infiltration in America, Garfield refused to name communist party members or followers, testifying that, indeed, he knew none in the film industry. Garfield rejected communism, and just prior to his death in hopes of redeeming himself in the eyes of the blacklisters, wrote that he had been duped by communist ideology in an unpublished article called \"I Was a Sucker for a Left Hook\", a reference to Garfield's movies about boxing.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Bernstein| first1=Walter| title=Inside Out: A Memoir of the Blacklist| date=31 July 2013| publisher=Random House| location=New York| isbn=978-0-8041-5048-4| pages=304| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XwBAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT220| accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref> However, his forced testimony before the committee had severely damaged his reputation. He was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] in ''[[Red Channels]]'', and barred from future employment as an actor by Hollywood [[movie studio]] bosses for the remainder of his career.<ref name=Beaver/>\n\nWith film work scarce because of the blacklist, Garfield returned to Broadway and starred in a 1952 revival of ''[[Golden Boy (play)|Golden Boy]]'', finally being cast in the lead role denied him years before.\n\n==Death==\n[[Image:Garfield 800.jpg|thumb|200px|John Garfield's grave in [[Westchester Hills Cemetery]]]]\n[[File:John Garfield Footstone 2007.JPG|thumb|left|John Garfield's footstone]]\nOn May 9, 1952, Garfield moved out of his New York apartment for the last time, indicating to friends that the separation from his wife Roberta was not temporary. He confided to columnist [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] that he would soon be divorced. Close friends speculated that it was his wife's opposition to his planned confession in ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine that triggered the separation. He heard that a HUAC investigator was reviewing his testimony for possible perjury charges. His agent reported that [[20th Century Fox|20th Century-Fox]] wanted him for a film called ''Taxi'', but would not even begin talks unless the investigation concluded in his favor. Three actor friends, [[Canada Lee]], [[Mady Christians]] and [[J. Edward Bromberg]], had all recently died after being listed by the committee.<ref name=Swindell/>\n\nIn the morning of May 20, Garfield, against his doctor's strict orders, played several strenuous sets of tennis with a friend, mentioning the fact that he had not been to bed the night before. He met actress Iris Whitney for dinner, and afterward became suddenly ill complaining that he felt chilled. She took him to her apartment, where he refused to let her call a doctor and instead went to bed. The next morning, she found him dead. Long-term heart problems, allegedly aggravated by the stress of his blacklisting, had led to his death at the age of 39.<ref>{{cite journal| first1=William| last1=Pechter| first2=Abraham| last2=Polonsky| title=Abraham Polonsky and \"Force of Evil\"| url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1210628?seq=1| journal=Film Quarterly| volume=15| number=3| date=Spring 1962| page=53| quote=(Pechter interviewing Polonsky): \"It has been suggested that John Garfield's political difficulties and debarment from Hollywood work was a considerable influence in accelerating his early death.
