In some cases, a live drummer was hired to play beats between songs to maintain the dance floor.

These parties quickly became profitable for the promoters, who would sell admission, food, and alcohol, leading to fierce competition between DJs for the biggest sound systems and newest records.<ref name=\"Moskowitz2006\">{{cite book|author=David Vlado Moskowitz|title=Caribbean Popular Music: An Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rock Steady, and Dancehall|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDKfGRCq73cC&pg=PA297|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33158-9|pages=297\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==1960s and 1970s==\nIn the mid-1960s, nightclubs and discoth\u00e8ques continued to grow in Europe and the United States.

In 1969, American club DJ [[Francis Grasso]] popularized beatmatching at [[New York City|New York]]'s Sanctuary nightclub. Beatmatching is the technique of creating seamless transitions between records with ''matching'' ''beats'', or tempos. Grasso also developed [[slip-cueing|slip-cuing]], a technique long used in radio, where holding a record still while the turntable is revolving underneath and releasing it at the desired moment created a sudden transition from the previous record.<ref name=\"BrewsterBroughton2014\">{{cite book|author1=Bill Brewster|author2=Frank Broughton|title=Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MxTnBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT126|date=13 May 2014|publisher=Open Road + Grove/Atlantic|isbn=978-0-8021-9436-7|pages=126\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Jr.2017\">{{cite book|author=Joseph C.

Neighborhood block parties that were modelled after Jamaican sound systems gained popularity in Europe and in the [[borough]]s of [[New York City]].\n\nIn 1973, [[Jamaica|Jamaican-born]] [[DJ Kool Herc]], widely regarded as the \"father of [[hip-hop culture]],\" performed at block parties in his [[The Bronx|Bronx]] neighborhood and developed a technique of mixing back and forth between two identical records to extend the rhythmic instrumental segment, or ''[[break (music)|break]]''. Turntablism, the art of using turntables not only to play music but to manipulate sound and create original music, began to develop.<ref>{{cite news|title=Turntable Teaching .Berklee College Offers Course On Scratching.|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1914&dat=20040218&id=lghHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kfMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3334,3014916|accessdate=29 December 2013|newspaper=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)|Sun Journal]]|date=18 February 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] released the first [[Technics SL-1200|SL-1200]] turntable, which evolved into the SL-1200 MK2 in 1979\u2014which, as of the early-2010s, remains an industry standard for DJing. In 1974, German [[electronic music]] band [[Kraftwerk]] released the 22-minute song \"[[Autobahn (song)|Autobahn]],\" which takes up the entire first side of [[Autobahn (album)|the album of the same title]]. Years later, Kraftwerk would become a significant influence on [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] artists such as [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[house music]] pioneer [[Frankie Knuckles]]. During the mid-1970s, [[Hip hop music|Hip-hop music]] and culture began to emerge, originating among urban [[African American]]s and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] in New York City. The four main elements of [[hip hop|Hip Hop culture]] are [[graffiti]], DJing, [[b-boying]], and [[Rapping|MCing (rapping)]].\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the soul-funk blend of dance pop known as disco took off in the mainstream pop charts in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], causing discoth\u00e8ques to experience a rebirth. Unlike many late-1960s clubs, which featured live bands, discoth\u00e8ques used the DJ's selection and mixing of records as the entertainment. In 1975, [[record pool]]s began, providing disc jockeys access to newer music from the industry in an efficient method.\n\nIn 1975,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rane.com/dj/gwtheo.html |title=Rane.com |access-date=2016-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810192126/http://www.rane.com/dj/gwtheo.html |archive-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> hip-hop DJ [[Grand Wizard Theodore]] invented the scratching technique by accident.

In 1979, the [[Sugar Hill Gang]] released \"[[Rapper's Delight]]\", the first hip-hop record to become a hit.\n\nIn 1977, [[Saratoga Springs, NY]] disc jockey Tom L. Lewis introduced the Disco Bible (later renamed Disco Beats), which published hit disco songs listed by beats per minute (tempo), as well as by either artist or song title.

Around the same time, the disco-influenced electronic style of dance music called [[house music]] emerged in Chicago. The name was derived from the [[Warehouse Club]] in [[Chicago]], where resident DJ [[Frankie Knuckles]] mixed old disco classics and Eurosynth pop. House music is essentially disco music with electronic drum machine beats. The common element of most house music is a 4/4 beat generated by a [[drum machine]] or other electronic means (such as a sampler), together with a solid (usually also electronically generated) synth [[bassline]]. In 1983, [[Jesse Saunders]] released what some consider the first house music track, \"On & On.\" The mid-1980s also saw the emergence of [[New York house|New York Garage]], a house music hybrid that was inspired by Levan's style and sometimes eschewed the accentuated high-hats of the [[Chicago house]] sound.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, [[techno music]] emerged from the [[Detroit]] club scene. Being geographically located between Chicago and New York, Detroit techno artists combined elements of Chicago house and New York garage along with European imports. Techno distanced itself from disco's roots by becoming almost purely electronic with synthesized beats. In 1985, the Winter Music Conference started in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] Florida and became the premier electronic music conference for dance music disc jockeys.\n\nIn 1985, TRAX Dance Music Guide was launched by American Record Pool in Beverly Hills. It was the first national DJ-published music magazine, created on the [[Macintosh]] computer using extensive music market research and early desktop publishing tools. In 1986, \"[[Walk This Way]]\", a rap/rock collaboration by [[Run DMC]] and [[Aerosmith]], became the first hip-hop song to reach the Top 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. This song was the first exposure of hip-hop music, as well as the concept of the disc jockey as band member and artist, to many mainstream audiences. In 1988, ''DJ Times'' magazine was first published. It was the first US-based magazine specifically geared toward the professional mobile and club DJ.\n\n==1990s==\nDuring the early 1990s, the rave scene built on the [[acid house]] scene. The rave scene changed dance music, the image of DJs, and the nature of promoting. The innovative marketing surrounding the rave scene created the first [[superstar]] DJs who established marketable \"brands\" around their names and sound. Some of these celebrity DJs toured around the world and were able to branch out into other music-related activities. During the early 1990s, the Compact Disc surpassed the gramophone record in popularity, but gramophone records continued to be made (although in very limited quantities) into the 21st century\u2014particularly for club DJs and for local acts recording on small regional labels.\n\nIn 1991, ''Mobile Beat'' magazine, geared specifically toward mobile DJs, began publishing and in their premier edition featured award-winning club & Mobile DJ Chris Pangalos from Rolling Thunder Productions.   Pangalos was also featured in the April 1993 edition of ''DJ Times'' magazine as well.  \n\nIn 1992, the [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] released the MPEG-1 standard, designed to produce reasonable sound at low bit rates. The lossy compression scheme MPEG-1 Layer-3, popularly known as [[MP3]], later revolutionized the digital music domain. In 1993, the first [[internet]] \"radio station\", Internet Talk Radio, was developed by [[Carl Malamud]]. Because the audio was relayed over the internet, it was possible to access internet radio stations from anywhere in the world. This made it a popular service for both amateur and professional disc jockeys operating from a personal computer.\n\n[[File:DJ performing with Danny Brown 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|DJ performing with [[Danny Brown (rapper)|Danny Brown]] in 2014]]\n\nIn 1998, the first MP3 digital audio player was released, the Eiger Labs MPMan F10. N2IT developed [[Final Scratch]] between 1998 and 2002 and showed a non-functioning prototype at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to allow DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded [[vinyl record]]s or CDs.  The \"Final Scratch\" system developed by N2IT shipped it first working units in early 2002 and DJs were spinning on digital vinyl by mid 2002.  While it would take sometime for this novel concept to catch on with the \"die hard Vinyl DJs\", This would soon become the first step in the new Digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJing pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being Professor Jam (a.k.a. William P. Rader), who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the \"CPS (Computerized Performance System) DJ Summit\", to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.\n\nIn 1998, Nathan Burton (England) started using Computers to Dj instead of vinyls using the popular mpeg3 format at the time.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 1999, [[Shawn Fanning]] released [[Napster]], the first of the massively popular [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] systems. During this period, the AVLA (Audio Video Licensing Agency) of Canada announced an MP3 DJing license, administered by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. This meant that DJs could apply for a license giving them the right to perform publicly using music stored on a hard drive, instead of having to cart their whole CD collections around to their gigs.\n\n==2000s==\nAt the start of the new century, the introduction of advances in technology made it possible for new sounds to be developed. The introduction of the Pioneer SVM-1000 Audio and Video Mixer and other high tech digital sound mixers made a whole new culture of disco DJ integration. In early 2000s, a software company created [[Atomix (software)|Atomix]]; an audio application that allowed its users to blend MP3s from their personal library in real time or record. Internet DJs like [[Chinese Assassin DJs]], [[DJ Spylah]], [[DJ Dubblz]], [[DJ Loudmouth]], [[DJ Rondon]], and many more led the wave of virtual DJs. Mixtapes flooded the online markets where Virtual DJs began to merge and network with classic DJs. The proliferation of Internet technologies have also created a culture of disc jockey enthusiast groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeromagnitude.com/|title=ZeroMagnitude - Professional DJs Extreme Remixes|work=ZeroMagnitude}}</ref> DJ battles imitating the events on the game gave the DJ industry a more competitive phase.

They would usually play 45-rpm records, featuring hit singles on one turntable while talking between songs. In some cases, a live drummer was hired to play beats between songs to maintain the dance floor.

These parties quickly became profitable for the promoters, who would sell admission, food, and alcohol, leading to fierce competition between DJs for the biggest sound systems and newest records.<ref name=\"Moskowitz2006\">{{cite book|author=David Vlado Moskowitz|title=Caribbean Popular Music: An Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rock Steady, and Dancehall|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDKfGRCq73cC&pg=PA297|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33158-9|pages=297\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==1960s and 1970s==\nIn the mid-1960s, nightclubs and discoth\u00e8ques continued to grow in Europe and the United States. Specialized DJ equipment, such as [[Rudy Bozak]]'s classic CMA-10-2DL mixer, began to appear on the market. In 1969, American club DJ [[Francis Grasso]] popularized beatmatching at [[New York City|New York]]'s Sanctuary nightclub. Beatmatching is the technique of creating seamless transitions between records with ''matching'' ''beats'', or tempos. Grasso also developed [[slip-cueing|slip-cuing]], a technique long used in radio, where holding a record still while the turntable is revolving underneath and releasing it at the desired moment created a sudden transition from the previous record.<ref name=\"BrewsterBroughton2014\">{{cite book|author1=Bill Brewster|author2=Frank Broughton|title=Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MxTnBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT126|date=13 May 2014|publisher=Open Road + Grove/Atlantic|isbn=978-0-8021-9436-7|pages=126\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Jr.2017\">{{cite book|author=Joseph C.

Neighborhood block parties that were modelled after Jamaican sound systems gained popularity in Europe and in the [[borough]]s of [[New York City]].\n\nIn 1973, [[Jamaica|Jamaican-born]] [[DJ Kool Herc]], widely regarded as the \"father of [[hip-hop culture]],\" performed at block parties in his [[The Bronx|Bronx]] neighborhood and developed a technique of mixing back and forth between two identical records to extend the rhythmic instrumental segment, or ''[[break (music)|break]]''. Turntablism, the art of using turntables not only to play music but to manipulate sound and create original music, began to develop.<ref>{{cite news|title=Turntable Teaching .Berklee College Offers Course On Scratching.|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1914&dat=20040218&id=lghHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kfMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3334,3014916|accessdate=29 December 2013|newspaper=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)|Sun Journal]]|date=18 February 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] released the first [[Technics SL-1200|SL-1200]] turntable, which evolved into the SL-1200 MK2 in 1979\u2014which, as of the early-2010s, remains an industry standard for DJing. In 1974, German [[electronic music]] band [[Kraftwerk]] released the 22-minute song \"[[Autobahn (song)|Autobahn]],\" which takes up the entire first side of [[Autobahn (album)|the album of the same title]]. Years later, Kraftwerk would become a significant influence on [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] artists such as [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[house music]] pioneer [[Frankie Knuckles]]. During the mid-1970s, [[Hip hop music|Hip-hop music]] and culture began to emerge, originating among urban [[African American]]s and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] in New York City. The four main elements of [[hip hop|Hip Hop culture]] are [[graffiti]], DJing, [[b-boying]], and [[Rapping|MCing (rapping)]].\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the soul-funk blend of dance pop known as disco took off in the mainstream pop charts in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], causing discoth\u00e8ques to experience a rebirth. Unlike many late-1960s clubs, which featured live bands, discoth\u00e8ques used the DJ's selection and mixing of records as the entertainment. In 1975, [[record pool]]s began, providing disc jockeys access to newer music from the industry in an efficient method.\n\nIn 1975,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rane.com/dj/gwtheo.html |title=Rane.com |access-date=2016-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810192126/http://www.rane.com/dj/gwtheo.html |archive-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> hip-hop DJ [[Grand Wizard Theodore]] invented the scratching technique by accident.

In 1979, the [[Sugar Hill Gang]] released \"[[Rapper's Delight]]\", the first hip-hop record to become a hit.\n\nIn 1977, [[Saratoga Springs, NY]] disc jockey Tom L. Lewis introduced the Disco Bible (later renamed Disco Beats), which published hit disco songs listed by beats per minute (tempo), as well as by either artist or song title. Billboard ran an article on the new publication, and it went national relatively quickly. The list made it easier for beginning DJs to learn how to create seamless transitions between songs without dancers having to change their rhythm on the dance floor.<ref name=\"Echols2010\">{{cite book|author=Alice Echols|title=Hot Stuff: Disco and the Remaking of American Culture|url=https://archive.org/details/hotstuffdiscorem00echo|url-access=registration|date=29 March 2010|publisher=W.

Around the same time, the disco-influenced electronic style of dance music called [[house music]] emerged in Chicago. The name was derived from the [[Warehouse Club]] in [[Chicago]], where resident DJ [[Frankie Knuckles]] mixed old disco classics and Eurosynth pop. House music is essentially disco music with electronic drum machine beats. The common element of most house music is a 4/4 beat generated by a [[drum machine]] or other electronic means (such as a sampler), together with a solid (usually also electronically generated) synth [[bassline]]. In 1983, [[Jesse Saunders]] released what some consider the first house music track, \"On & On.\" The mid-1980s also saw the emergence of [[New York house|New York Garage]], a house music hybrid that was inspired by Levan's style and sometimes eschewed the accentuated high-hats of the [[Chicago house]] sound.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, [[techno music]] emerged from the [[Detroit]] club scene. Being geographically located between Chicago and New York, Detroit techno artists combined elements of Chicago house and New York garage along with European imports. Techno distanced itself from disco's roots by becoming almost purely electronic with synthesized beats. In 1985, the Winter Music Conference started in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] Florida and became the premier electronic music conference for dance music disc jockeys.\n\nIn 1985, TRAX Dance Music Guide was launched by American Record Pool in Beverly Hills. It was the first national DJ-published music magazine, created on the [[Macintosh]] computer using extensive music market research and early desktop publishing tools. In 1986, \"[[Walk This Way]]\", a rap/rock collaboration by [[Run DMC]] and [[Aerosmith]], became the first hip-hop song to reach the Top 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. This song was the first exposure of hip-hop music, as well as the concept of the disc jockey as band member and artist, to many mainstream audiences. In 1988, ''DJ Times'' magazine was first published. It was the first US-based magazine specifically geared toward the professional mobile and club DJ.\n\n==1990s==\nDuring the early 1990s, the rave scene built on the [[acid house]] scene. The rave scene changed dance music, the image of DJs, and the nature of promoting. The innovative marketing surrounding the rave scene created the first [[superstar]] DJs who established marketable \"brands\" around their names and sound. Some of these celebrity DJs toured around the world and were able to branch out into other music-related activities. During the early 1990s, the Compact Disc surpassed the gramophone record in popularity, but gramophone records continued to be made (although in very limited quantities) into the 21st century\u2014particularly for club DJs and for local acts recording on small regional labels.\n\nIn 1991, ''Mobile Beat'' magazine, geared specifically toward mobile DJs, began publishing and in their premier edition featured award-winning club & Mobile DJ Chris Pangalos from Rolling Thunder Productions.   Pangalos was also featured in the April 1993 edition of ''DJ Times'' magazine as well.  \n\nIn 1992, the [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] released the MPEG-1 standard, designed to produce reasonable sound at low bit rates. The lossy compression scheme MPEG-1 Layer-3, popularly known as [[MP3]], later revolutionized the digital music domain. In 1993, the first [[internet]] \"radio station\", Internet Talk Radio, was developed by [[Carl Malamud]]. Because the audio was relayed over the internet, it was possible to access internet radio stations from anywhere in the world. This made it a popular service for both amateur and professional disc jockeys operating from a personal computer.\n\n[[File:DJ performing with Danny Brown 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|DJ performing with [[Danny Brown (rapper)|Danny Brown]] in 2014]]\n\nIn 1998, the first MP3 digital audio player was released, the Eiger Labs MPMan F10. N2IT developed [[Final Scratch]] between 1998 and 2002 and showed a non-functioning prototype at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to allow DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded [[vinyl record]]s or CDs.  The \"Final Scratch\" system developed by N2IT shipped it first working units in early 2002 and DJs were spinning on digital vinyl by mid 2002.  While it would take sometime for this novel concept to catch on with the \"die hard Vinyl DJs\", This would soon become the first step in the new Digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJing pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being Professor Jam (a.k.a. William P. Rader), who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the \"CPS (Computerized Performance System) DJ Summit\", to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.\n\nIn 1998, Nathan Burton (England) started using Computers to Dj instead of vinyls using the popular mpeg3 format at the time.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 1999, [[Shawn Fanning]] released [[Napster]], the first of the massively popular [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] systems. During this period, the AVLA (Audio Video Licensing Agency) of Canada announced an MP3 DJing license, administered by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. This meant that DJs could apply for a license giving them the right to perform publicly using music stored on a hard drive, instead of having to cart their whole CD collections around to their gigs.\n\n==2000s==\nAt the start of the new century, the introduction of advances in technology made it possible for new sounds to be developed. The introduction of the Pioneer SVM-1000 Audio and Video Mixer and other high tech digital sound mixers made a whole new culture of disco DJ integration. In early 2000s, a software company created [[Atomix (software)|Atomix]]; an audio application that allowed it's users to blend mp3s from his personal library in real time or record. Internet DJs like [[Chinese Assassin DJs]], [[DJ Spylah]], [[DJ Dubblz]], [[DJ Loudmouth]], [[DJ Rondon]], and many more led the wave of virtual DJs. Mixtapes flooded the online markets where Virtual DJs began to merge and network with classic DJs. The proliferation of Internet technologies have also created a culture of disc jockey enthusiast groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeromagnitude.com/|title=ZeroMagnitude - Professional DJs Extreme Remixes|work=ZeroMagnitude}}</ref> DJ battles imitating the events on the game gave the DJ industry a more competitive phase.
