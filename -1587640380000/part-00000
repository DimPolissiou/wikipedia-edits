While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Brown goods typically require high technical knowledge and skills (which get more complex with time, such as going from a [[soldering iron]] to a hot-air soldering station), while white goods may need more practical skills and force to manipulate the devices and heavy tools required to repair them.\n\n==Definition==\nGiven a broad usage, the domestic application attached to home appliance is tied to the definition of [[Appliance (disambiguation)|appliance]] as \"an instrument or device designed for a particular use or function\".<ref>{{cite dictionary | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/appliance | title=Appliance | dictionary=Merriam Webster | accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> More specifically, [[Collins English Dictionary]] defines \"home appliance\" as: \"devices or machines, usually electrical, that are in your home and which you use to do jobs such as cleaning or cooking\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/household-appliances | title=Definition of household appliances | publisher=Collins Dictionary | accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> The broad usage, afforded to the definition allows for nearly any device intended for domestic use to be a home appliance, including [[consumer electronics]] as well as [[stove]]s,<ref name=\"Bulletin 2014\"/> [[refrigerator]]s, [[toaster]]s<ref name=\"Bulletin 2014\"/> and [[air conditioner]]s.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Toaster, Universal, Model E947, c. 1915, Landers, Frary and Clark, New Britain, Connecticut, Wolfsonian-FIU Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Early 20th century electric [[toaster]]]]\n<!-- The reference structure of this section seems to be \"refs at the end of each paragraph\". Feel free to reference however you like, though-->\nWhile many appliances have existed for centuries, the self-contained electric or gas powered appliances are a uniquely American innovation that emerged in the twentieth century. The development of these appliances is tied to the disappearance of full-time [[domestic servant]]s and the desire to reduce the time-consuming activities in pursuit of more recreational time. In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included [[washing machine]]s, [[water heating|water heaters]], [[refrigerator]]s, [[kettle]]s and [[sewing machine]]s. The invention of Earl Richardson's small electric [[clothes iron]] in 1903 gave a small initial boost to the home appliance industry.<!--For this sentence only   <ref name=\"George2003\"/>  . Also, research \"Hotpoint Iron\". Also, linking to [[Earl Richardson]] will give the wrong person --> In the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion]], the domestic use of [[dishwasher]]s, and [[clothes dryer]]s were part of a shift for convenience.

Throughout this period companies merged and acquired one another to reduce research and production costs and eliminate competitors, resulting in [[antitrust legislation]].\n\nThe [[United States Department of Energy]] reviews compliance with the [[National Appliance Energy Conservation Act]] of 1987, which required manufacturers to reduce the energy consumption of the appliances by 25% every five years.<ref name=\"eai\" />\n\nIn the 1990s, the appliance industry was very consolidated, with over 90% of the products being sold by just five companies.

In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included [[washing machine]]s, [[water heating|water heaters]], [[refrigerator]]s, [[kettle]]s and [[sewing machine]]s.

He is known for his unique voice and [[music style]] that no other singer from Afghanistan has been able to surpass. Sarban's songs are unrivalled for their choice of poetry, originality of composition, and sophisticated orchestration. He is known as the [[Frank Sinatra]] of Afghanistan and was also the first Afghan artist to break away from the prevalent musical forms in Afghanistan at the time, namely the Indian inspired pure classical tradition (epitomized by [[Ustad Sarahang]], [[Rahim Bakhsh]] and others), and the 'Mohali' (regional & folk) musical traditions exemplified by the Pashto music, logari, qataghani, qarsak etc.  In partnership with the legendary composer Salim Sarmast, Sarban's music fused elements, rhythms and orchestration of the western musical traditions of jazz and \"Belle Chanson\" with the prevalent Afghan musical tradition to create a unique and lasting style which became an inspiration for all ensuing artists including the great [[Ahmad Zahir]].\n\nBorn 1930 in Kabul, Afghanistan. Sarban sang predominantly in Dari as well as Pashto, possessing a deep and comprehensive understanding of the Persian poetic tradition (ranging from the poetry of Hafiz, Rumi, Khayyam to Khusro and Bedil).  Apart from his first few songs, Sarban chose the poems (lyrics) to all his songs, based on his own personal knowledge of the Persian literary canon. During the early stages of his career, Sarban worked with many musicians and composers such as Nainawaz and Taranasaz. However, during the middle and late stages of his career, he worked almost exclusively with the composer Salim Sarmast.  Sarban's songs Ahesta Bero, Khorsheede Man<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kZlYFy4zms</ref> Ay Sarban, Dar Damane Sahra, Biya ke Borem ba Mazar, Moshke Taza Mebarad, Ay Shakhe Gul, Biya Ta Gul Beyafshanem, Ya Maula Dilam Tang Amada, Take Nabashi Hamdame Jani, Suraya Chara Am Kun, Tu Aftabi Wo Man, and many others are rank among the highest in the Afghan musical repertoire and are admired for their depth, refinement, and beauty.\n\nSarban's legacy permanently altered the Persian (Dari) musical tradition in Afghanistan. Almost every great artist that came after him including Ahmad Zahir & Farhad Darya considered him their primary source of inspiration and they ranked his musical repertoire as their main model of emulation.  A national icon and celebrity in Afghanistan, Sarban is also widely admired in other Persian-speaking countries like [[Iran]] and [[Tajikistan]], where he gave live performances at the height of his career.\n\nSarban's artistic greatness, due to his eccentric and mysticist temperament, did not translate into financial prosperity for himself.  He was famed for refusing to do home (majlisi) shows for pay, and for giving the proceeds from his highly successful concerts to the beggars and the needy, without regard for his own or his family's financial well-being.  Sarban stopped producing songs in the 1960s. During the 1970s he was mainly involved in concerts & in re-recording his earlier music for audiocassettes (his original recordings at Radio Kabul at the time could not be converted to audio cassette form due to lack of high quality sound equipment in Afghanistan). In 1984, Sarban suffered from a stroke which left him paralyzed and unable to speak.  This effectively ended his musical career.  During the civil war and unrest of 1990s in Kabul, Sarban left Afghanistan and migrated to Peshawar, Pakistan.   He lived in Pakistan until 1994 when he died in abject poverty.  12 years after his death, his remains were taken back to Afghanistan for reburial.<ref name=farhaddarya>[http://www.farhaddarya.info/latest_news_sarban_remains.html Farhad Darya website: Bringing Sarban's remains from Pakistan to Afghanistan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102084131/http://www.farhaddarya.info/latest_news_sarban_remains.html |date=November 2, 2013 }}</ref> to Kabul Afghanistan where he was reburied with pomp and honour as a national hero of Afghanistan for his contributions to furthering the art and culture of the country.\n\n== Career ==\nSarban gained popularity due to his music style, which was highly unconventional for its time, but it went on to become the gold standard of Afghan musical style. The legendary Afghan singer [[Ahmad Zahir]] was a huge fan of Sarban and incorporated his original songs and musical style into Zahir's own collection. Sarban's popularity is mainly with the elite and educated classes in Afghanistan where appreciation of his music is considered the height of sophistication, learning, and elegance.\n\nSarban's path to art and his immortality was purely accidental. Being born in a highly educated and accomplished family, Sarban was the only male family members who had not gone to university.  Sarban's career in art began when the director and \"father\" of the Afghan National Theatre, Ustad Abdul Rashid Latifi overheard him hum a song in a hamaam (communal baths customary in Kabul at the time). Ustad Latifi, however, did not conceive of Sarban as a singer since singing, at that time in Afghanistan, was a profession chosen very early in life and required years of work and training. Instead, Latifi asked Sarban to join his theatre troupe as a lead heroic actor, mainly due to his elegant & erudite elucidation and accent in Dari, which Sarban had naturally learned in his family upbringing. Sarban accepted the offer to work as an actor because, according to him, thing was tough and he had no prospects of employment and of feeding his young family.  While acting in the theatre, Sarban was rediscovered by the composers Nainawaz and Taranasaz for his extraordinary and evocative baritone voice. Thus, without any artistic, musical, or vocal training in voice or singing, Sarban was offered the opportunity to become a singer.  His first recorded song was \"Man Akher Az Ghamat Ay Mahro,\" and \"Tu Aftabi Wo Man.\"  The songs, played in Kabul Radio, generated a great degree of interest and enthusiasm among the public in Sarban's voice.\n\nUnlike any other great Afghan artist, Sarban stands alone in that he had no previous musical training in either playing instruments or using his voice.  He, however, had an acute ear for musical sound, and more importantly, a broad and profound understanding of Persian poetry. It is, perhaps, because of his lack of training and background in the predominant musical traditions in Afghanistan that Sarban became the artist who would free Afghan music from subservience to the Indian, Iranian, and folkloric musical traditions which dominated at the time.  In cooperation with composers, mainly Salim Sarmast, Sarban managed to create a musical language that was unique to Afghanistan.  Although his first few songs \"Tu Aftabi wo man,\" and \"Man akher az ghamat,\" were made strictly in the Indian classical model, his immediately ensuing songs \"Rahm kon ram kon,\" \"Saqi dile ma,\" \"ya maula dilam tang amada,\" \"shod abro para para,\" and the super hit songs, \"az bas ke nazanini,\" \"asare shikanje maujam,\" \"Man nainawaz am,\" and \"Harja ke safer karma,\" [the latter two songs covered by Ahmad Zahir] became models of a new sound that broke away from the traditional musical vocabulary in Afghanistan at the time.  This new sound was made immortal by the creation of a slew of songs in later years (such as Ahesta Bero, Ay Sarban, Dar Damane Sahra, Khorsheede Man, Ay Shakhe Gul, Moshke Taza Mebarad, Dosh Az Masjid, Deshab ba khoda, Nameporsi Naame man, Sobhe Keshaare Maiwar, Take nabashad ham dame jani, Ta ba kai ay mah liqa, Een ghame be haya mara, haal ke deewana shodam merawi, Aye shake gul) which defined Afghan music (especially the Persian musical genre) for decades to come.\n\nUnfortunately, Sarban's personal life, especially his numerous family troubles, constantly hindered his complete devotion to his musical career.  Sarban was never able to fully commit himself to his art because of many family tragedies and difficulties that befell him persistently throughout his life.  He routinely fell into deep clinical depression due to the numerous concerns in his personal and family life such as the loss of his close relatives and family members including his beloved brothers (for their political activities).  Consequently, he took to heavy drinking to deal with his many personal problems. This took a heavy toll on his career, as he failed to produce any original music after the mid 1970s.  Nevertheless, his musical legacy and influence remain unparalleled in Afghanistan.\n\n== Contributions ==\nSarban's greatest contribution to Afghan music was the creation of a unique Afghan sound\u2014distinct from the Indian, Iranian, regional (folkloric), western traditions.  His songs set an example for all pursuing Afghan artists to compose & perform in a style that was distinctly identifiable as Afghan, as opposed to mere imitation of other musical traditions.  His work with the legendary composer Salim Sarmast led to the creation of a rhythm, melody line, harmony, and texture which became the essence of the Dari (Persian) sound.  This sound was a major influence on many later musicians including Nainawaz, Ahmad Zahir, Ustad Zaland, Ahmad Wali, & later Farhad Darya.\n\nBesides a unique and new musical sound, Sarban was the first artist to choose poems & lyrics for his songs which were not primarily about romantic love.  The vast majority of songs in Afghanistan up to that point chose poems/lyrics about romance, love, longing, and the trials and tribulations related to love.  Sarban considered this trend to be frivolous and glib.  He, therefore, made a sharp departure from this tradition, and chose social, political, economic, spiritual, and even religious matters as subject matter for his songs.  An astute student of Dari/Persian literature, he personally picked poems  which were considered by many to be not only unconventional but unsuitable for being turned into songs.  For instance, Een Ghame Be Haya, Ay Sarban, and Dar Damane Sahra, Ay Shakhe Gul, Harja Ke Safar Kardam, Beya Ta Gal Beyafshanem, were considered too erudite, abstract, and gloomy to be composed into songs. Almost all composers declined to consider them for composition.  Salim Sarmast was the only composer who offered to do the task.  Today, these are among the best songs of Afghan musical tradition.  Sometimes, if he did not get his way & was pressured by his employer (Kabul Radio) to sing more conventional love songs, he would pick a completely unrelated verse or two from another poem & insert it in the romantic song composed for him.  For instance, in his song \"Soraya chara Am kon,\" which contains a traditional romantic subject matter, he violently inserted a completely unrelated verse:\n\nAgar Dastam Rasad Ba Charkhe Gardoon\n(If my hands could reach/grab the one who runs the universe)\nAzo Porsam Ke Een Chook Auto Aan Choon\n(I shall demand of him, how is this so?)\nYaki Ra Dadayi Sad Nazo Nehmat\n(One person you lavish with a hundred gifts & prides)\nYaki Ra Qorse Jawr alooda Bar Khoon\n(But another you torture with the yoke of blood & misery)\n\nSarban was the first person to put lyrics to the iconic \"[[Ahesta Boro]]\" (Step softly) anthem played for all brides on their wedding day. These lyrics, along with the composition, have become an expected and celebrated feature of Afghan weddings, with the composition also having been sung by many popular Afghan artists. Muslim singer [[Sami Yusuf]] used the tune of a Sarban composition, \"Beyake Berem Ba Mazaar\" (Come, Lets Go to Mazaar), in his song \"Hasbi Rasbi\". Many others have covered the song and composition as well, both within Afghanistan and in other Persian cultures.\n\nSarban's \"Moshke Taza Mebarad\" (based on an obscure poem glorifying the city of his birth, Kabul) became one of the models for patriotic and national songs, and is still one of the most evocative and emotionally stirring Patriotic songs of Afghanistan due to its original and moving composition and evocative singing by Sarban.  It is said that many composers laughed at Sarban when he suggested the poem for composition into a national song due to the poem's complex vocabulary and imagery, but once again, his main artistic collaborator Salim Sarmast came to the rescue and set the lyrics to a sublime composition which moves Afghans to this day with the words\nMoshke Taza Mebarad Abre Bhmand kabul\n(Fresh Musk Scatter the silky Clouds of Kabul)\nMauje Sabza mekarad Koyo barzane Kabul\n(Waves & waves of greenery grow the mountains and rocks of Kabul)\n\nIn addition to the various compositions and lyrics he contributed, Sarban was also arguably symbolic and typical of Afghanistan's culture in his day, reflected in his singing of the beautiful poetry of many famous poets from ages past, such as Hafiz Shirazi, to whom he paid tribute with the song \"Dozh as Masjid (Soye Maykhanaa Aamad Peer e Ma)\" (Last night, upon departing the Mosque, our Master headed towards the Tavern). Sarban's cover is a cut down version of the original poem, retaining 3 of the 10 verses composed by Shirazi.\n\nSarban's compositions, like \"Dozh as Masjid\", feature various styles of Sufi or mystical poetry, which use the metaphorical language of romantic love, to describe the author's relationship with God.  Often such poems use words such as \"beloved\" figuratively in reference to God, and it could be argued that Sarban was part of a musical movement in Afghanistan which sought to enlighten the audience as much as it entertained them. Certainly, in his own personal life, Sarban was highly influenced by the Sufi tradition of mysticism.  This is evident not only in his choice of poetry, but also in his mannerisms, such as his constant raising of his forefinger when speaking or singing (the raised forefinger is the mystic's gesture denoting not only the oneness of God, but also the oneness of all creation and being.\n\nArguably, the most highly acclaimed song in Persian Language in Afghanistan is Sarban's Khorsheede Man Kojayee, which has been covered by numerous Afghan Artists.  The song, considered by critics as the greatest Afghan Persian song, was based on a poem by the Kurdish Persian poet Abolqasem Lahouti and composed by Salim Sarmast.  The song exemplifies the highest tradition of Afghan music in which sublime poetry is fused with hypnotizing melody & music, and extraordinarily emotive elocution.  Furthermore, Sarban's songs \"Ay Sarban\" (based on a poem by Saadi), Dar Damane Sahra are considered among the most accomplished examples of the Afghan musical repertoire.\n\nAlmost all of Sarban's songs were recorded in the first decade of his career\u20141960s.  Sadly, the vast majority of his original repertoire, which was recorded with a full orchestra, is not available to us. Except for a few songs from the original recordings (Khorsheede Man, Asare Shikanje Maujam, Az Bas Ke Nazanini), the overwhelming majority of Sarban's songs are re-recordings which were done in the late 1970s and released in audio cassettes.  These later versions lack the full orchestra and chorus and rely on only a few instruments.  Furthermore, Sarban's vocal gifts were past their prime at that point. Most of originals recordings which were held at Kabul Radio, were destroyed by the Taliban in the late 1990s when the Taliban captured Kabul & destroyed a large number of original recordings of the Afghan musical repertoire in Kabul Radio, and Afghan Television.  As a result, it is possible the some of his most memorable recordings are permanently lost.  Recently, however, a few vintage and rare recordings of Sarban's records (for instance the original of his song Khorsheede Man, and Asare Shikanje Moujam) were uploaded by some good samaritans on YouTube.\n\nSarban's songs have been covered both live and in recording by a vast number of Persian singes in countries ranging from Afghanistan, Iran, Tajikistan, to Uzbekistan.  In Afghanistan, his song \"Ahesta Bero\" is played in every Persian wedding as the bride walks to the aisle, in the same manner as Wagner's Bridal Chorus \"Here Comes the Bride\" is played each time a bride in the west walks the aisle.  His song such as Ay Sarban is covered by hugely popular singers such as Googoosh (from Iran) and Ahmad Zahir from Afghanistan.  Every successful musician from Ahmad Zahir to Farhad Darya cite him as one of their main influences.\n\n== Personal life ==\nSarban was born in Saragy, an old area of Kabul to the prominent and highly respected Mahmoody family.  His father was a well educated, highly respected, and prosperous rice merchant.  The Mahmoodys were a family of illustrious doctors and surgeons highly respected among the educated elite of Kabul.  However, The Mahmoody family had been at the forefront of social agitation and political activism for decades.  As a result, his family was continuously persecuted by the monarchy at first, and then by successive governments which came after the monarchy.  This persecution resulted in a huge diminishment of the family's wealth to the point that by the time Sarban was in his teens, they were virtually penniless.  Furthermore, the majority of the most prominent and successful family members (including Sarban's only two brothers, and almost all of his first cousins) had been either executed or exiled by the time Sarban had begun his musical career.\n\nThese were the conditions under which Sarban lived.  Added to this was immense financial hardships, exacerbated by his familial background because most doors to work had been closed to him.  These conditions profoundly influenced his choice of poetry and his music.  For instance, he chose the poem \"Een Ghame Be Haya,\" for composition when his first cousin Engineer Latif Mahmoody had been arrested and executed.\n\nSarban was shy and reclusive throughout his life. He seemed indifferent to fame, celebrity, and wealth for his entire life, even when through the prime of his career, which began peaking in the 1960s <ref>[http://tribune.com.pk/story/399319/afghans-sing-again-of-love-and-war/ AFP / ''The Express Tribune'': Afghans sing again -- of love and war]</ref> At the peak of his celebrity, he polarized the Afghan intellectual class between those who loved and referred him for his art and those who criticized him for his personal life (i.e. his eccentric behaviour, his fondness for alcohol etc., rather than his artistic accomplishments).  Speculations said he had a constant problem with alcohol with claims he couldn't sing live on [[Kabul Radio]] without having a drink first. There are apocryphal stories that he had deep depression because he fell in love with one of his cousins, but reportedly she or her father did not accept his proposal, and that as a result Sarban was heartbroken and never married. However, these are mere rumours.  Sarban did fight with severe bouts of depression throughout his life, but this was not because of unrequited love.  Many of his close relatives (including his younger brother) were arrested for their political activities and executed by the communist regime at the time, and many others were imprisoned or forced to flee in exile.  This and the financial difficulties of raising a family without any reliable source of income were the main reasons for his depressive bouts.  As regards to his failed love with his cousin, these are mere rumours.  His close friends and family all dismiss this as urban legend.  Sarban was indeed married to one of his cousins, and he has four children (three daughters and a son).  HIs son Abdulrab Sarban also recorded an album covering some of Sarban's famous songs.  Sarban suffered a stroke in 1984 which incapacitated him & rendered him speechless.  Due to the political turmoil in Afghanistan, he and his family emigrated to Pakistan where he died in poverty. But after 12 years of his death, the Afghan Government made arrangements with his family to relocate his remains to Kabul.\n\nDiscography & Songs:\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* [https://soundcloud.com/ahmadzaher/sets/sarban-songs Sarban's all Songs on SoundCloud]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sarban, Abdul Rahim}}\n[[Category:Afghan singers]]\n[[Category:Afghan musicians]]\n[[Category:Afghan Tajik people]]\n[[Category:Tajik singers]]\n[[Category:1930 births]]\n[[Category:1993 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century singers]]\n[[Category:Afghan male singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century male singers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2013}}\n{{copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox musical artist\n|name         = Sarban\n|native_name  = {{nq|\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0646}}\n|background   = solo_singer\n|image        = \n|caption      = \n|birth_name   = Abdul Rahim\n|birth_date   = {{birth year|1930}}\n|birth_place  = [[Kabul, Afghanistan]]\n|death_date   = {{death-date and age|April 2, 1993|1930}}\n|death_place  = [[Peshawar, Pakistan]]\n|genre        = [[Soft rock]]<br>[[Classical music]]\n|occupation   = Singer\n|instrument   = [[Pump organ|Harmonium]]\n|years_active = 1950s-1986\n}}\n'''Abdul-Rahim Mahmoodi S\u0101rb\u0101n''' ({{lang-fa|\u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u06cc\u0645 \u0633\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0646}}), known simply as '''Sarban''', was an [[Afghan singer]] (1930 \u2013 April 2, 1993) \nwas born in [[Kabul, Afghanistan]]. He is known for his unique voice and [[music style]] that no other singer from Afghanistan has been able to surpass. Sarban's songs are unrivalled for their choice of poetry, originality of composition, and sophisticated orchestration. He is known as the [[Frank Sinatra]] of Afghanistan and was also the first Afghan artist to break away from the prevalent musical forms in Afghanistan at the time, namely the Indian inspired pure classical tradition (epitomized by [[Ustad Sarahang]], [[Rahim Bakhsh]] and others), and the 'Mohali' (regional & folk) musical traditions exemplified by the Pashto music, logari, qataghani, qarsak etc.  In partnership with the legendary composer Salim Sarmast, Sarban's music fused elements, rhythms and orchestration of the western musical traditions of jazz and \"Belle Chanson\" with the prevalent Afghan musical tradition to create a unique and lasting style which became an inspiration for all ensuing artists including the great [[Ahmad Zahir]].\n\nBorn 1930 in Kabul, Afghanistan. Sarban sang predominantly in Dari as well as Pashto, possessing a deep and comprehensive understanding of the Persian poetic tradition (ranging from the poetry of Hafiz, Rumi, Khayyam to Khusro and Bedil).  Apart from his first few songs, Sarban chose the poems (lyrics) to all his songs, based on his own personal knowledge of the Persian literary canon. During the early stages of his career, Sarban worked with many musicians and composers such as Nainawaz and Taranasaz. However, during the middle and late stages of his career, he worked almost exclusively with the composer Salim Sarmast.  Sarban's songs Ahesta Bero, Khorsheede Man<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kZlYFy4zms</ref> Ay Sarban, Dar Damane Sahra, Biya ke Borem ba Mazar, Moshke Taza Mebarad, Ay Shakhe Gul, Biya Ta Gul Beyafshanem, Ya Maula Dilam Tang Amada, Take Nabashi Hamdame Jani, Suraya Chara Am Kun, Tu Aftabi Wo Man, and many others are rank among the highest in the Afghan musical repertoire and are admired for their depth, refinement, and beauty.\n\nSarban's legacy permanently altered the Persian (Dari) musical tradition in Afghanistan. Almost every great artist that came after him including Ahmad Zahir & Farhad Darya considered him their primary source of inspiration and they ranked his musical repertoire as their main model of emulation.  A national icon and celebrity in Afghanistan, Sarban is also widely admired in other Persian-speaking countries like [[Iran]] and [[Tajikistan]], where he gave live performances at the height of his career.\n\nSarban's artistic greatness, due to his eccentric and mysticist temperament, did not translate into financial prosperity for himself.  He was famed for refusing to do home (majlisi) shows for pay, and for giving the proceeds from his highly successful concerts to the beggars and the needy, without regard for his own or his family's financial well-being.  Sarban stopped producing songs in the 1960s. During the 1970s he was mainly involved in concerts & in re-recording his earlier music for audiocassettes (his original recordings at Radio Kabul at the time could not be converted to audio cassette form due to lack of high quality sound equipment in Afghanistan). In 1984, Sarban suffered from a stroke which left him paralyzed and unable to speak.  This effectively ended his musical career.  During the civil war and unrest of 1990s in Kabul, Sarban left Afghanistan and migrated to Peshawar, Pakistan.   He lived in Pakistan until 1994 when he died in abject poverty.  12 years after his death, his remains were taken back to Afghanistan for reburial.<ref name=farhaddarya>[http://www.farhaddarya.info/latest_news_sarban_remains.html Farhad Darya website: Bringing Sarban's remains from Pakistan to Afghanistan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102084131/http://www.farhaddarya.info/latest_news_sarban_remains.html |date=November 2, 2013 }}</ref> to Kabul Afghanistan where he was reburied with pomp and honour as a national hero of Afghanistan for his contributions to furthering the art and culture of the country.\n\n== Career ==\nSarban gained popularity due to his music style, which was highly unconventional for its time, but it went on to become the gold standard of Afghan musical style.

Most of originals recordings which were held at Kabul Radio, were destroyed by the Taliban in the late 1990s when the Taliban captured Kabul & destroyed a large number of original recordings of the Afghan musical repertoire in Kabul Radio, and Afghan Television.  As a result, it is possible the some of his most memorable recordings are permanently lost.  Recently, however, a few vintage and rare recordings of Sarban's records (for instance the original of his song Khorsheede Man, and Asare Shikanje Moujam) were uploaded by some good samaritans on YouTube.\n\nSarban's songs have been covered both live and in recording by a vast number of Persian singes in countries ranging from Afghanistan, Iran, Tajikistan, to Uzbekistan.  In Afghanistan, his song \"Ahesta Bero\" is played in every Persian wedding as the bride walks to the aisle, in the same manner as Wagner's Bridal Chorus \"Here Comes the Bride\" is played each time a bride in the west walks the aisle.  His song such as Ay Sarban is covered by hugely popular singers such as Googoosh (from Iran) and Ahmad Zahir from Afghanistan.  Every successful musician from Ahmad Zahir to Farhad Darya cite him as one of their main influences.\n\n== Personal life ==\nSarban was born in Saragy, an old area of Kabul to the prominent and highly respected Mahmoody family.  His father was a well educated, highly respected, and prosperous rice merchant.  The Mahmoodys were a family of illustrious doctors and surgeons highly respected among the educated elite of Kabul.  However, The Mahmoody family had been at the forefront of social agitation and political activism for decades.  As a result, his family was continuously persecuted by the monarchy at first, and then by successive governments which came after the monarchy.  This persecution resulted in a huge diminishment of the family's wealth to the point that by the time Sarban was in his teens, they were virtually penniless.  Furthermore, the majority of the most prominent and successful family members (including Sarban's only two brothers, and almost all of his first cousins) had been either executed or exiled by the time Sarban had begun his musical career.\n\nThese were the conditions under which Sarban lived.  Added to this was immense financial hardships, exacerbated by his familial background because most doors to work had been closed to him.  These conditions profoundly influenced his choice of poetry and his music.  For instance, he chose the poem \"Een Ghame Be Haya,\" for composition when his first cousin Engineer Latif Mahmoody had been arrested and executed.\n\nSarban was shy and reclusive throughout his life. He seemed indifferent to fame, celebrity, and wealth for his entire life, even when through the prime of his career, which began peaking in the 1960s <ref>[http://tribune.com.pk/story/399319/afghans-sing-again-of-love-and-war/ AFP / ''The Express Tribune'': Afghans sing again -- of love and war]</ref> At the peak of his celebrity, he polarized the Afghan intellectual class between those who loved and referred him for his art and those who criticized him for his personal life (i.e. his eccentric behaviour, his fondness for alcohol etc., rather than his artistic accomplishments).  Speculations said he had a constant problem with alcohol with claims he couldn't sing live on [[Kabul Radio]] without having a drink first. There are apocryphal stories that he had deep depression because he fell in love with one of his cousins, but reportedly she or her father did not accept his proposal, and that as a result Sarban was heartbroken and never married. However, these are mere rumours.  Sarban did fight with severe bouts of depression throughout his life, but this was not because of unrequited love.  Many of his close relatives (including his younger brother) were arrested for their political activities and executed by the communist regime at the time, and many others were imprisoned or forced to flee in exile.  This and the financial difficulties of raising a family without any reliable source of income were the main reasons for his depressive bouts.  As regards to his failed love with his cousin, these are mere rumours.  His close friends and family all dismiss this as urban legend.  Sarban was indeed married to one of his cousins, and he has four children (three daughters and a son).  HIs son Abdulrab Sarban also recorded an album covering some of Sarban's famous songs.  Sarban suffered a stroke in 1984 which incapacitated him & rendered him speechless.  Due to the political turmoil in Afghanistan, he and his family emigrated to Pakistan where he died in poverty. But after 12 years of his death, the Afghan Government made arrangements with his family to relocate his remains to Kabul.\n\nDiscography & Songs:\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sarban, Abdul Rahim}}\n[[Category:Afghan singers]]\n[[Category:Afghan musicians]]\n[[Category:Afghan Tajik people]]\n[[Category:Tajik singers]]\n[[Category:1930 births]]\n[[Category:1993 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century singers]]\n[[Category:Afghan emigrants to Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Afghan male singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century male singers]]\n", "name_user": "Tajik.Aryan", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Rahim_Sarban"}

{"title_page": "David Garrick", "text_new": "{{Other people}}\n{{Short description|English actor, playwright, theatre manager and producer}}\n\n{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n[[File:David Garrick by Thomas Gainsborough.jpg|thumb|240px|Portrait of Garrick by [[Thomas Gainsborough]]]]\n\n'''David Garrick''' (19 February 1717 \u2013 20 January 1779) was an [[English people|English]] actor, playwright, [[Actor-manager|theatre manager]] and producer who influenced nearly all aspects of theatrical practice throughout the 18th century, and was a pupil and friend of [[Samuel Johnson|Dr Samuel Johnson]]. He appeared in a number of amateur theatricals, and with his appearance in the title role of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', audiences and managers began to take notice.\n\nImpressed by his portrayals of Richard III and a number of other roles, [[Charles Fleetwood (manager)|Charles Fleetwood]] engaged Garrick for a season at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]. He remained with the [[Drury Lane]] company for the next five years and purchased a share of the theatre with [[James Lacy]]. This purchase inaugurated 29 years of Garrick's management of the Drury Lane, during which time it rose to prominence as one of the leading theatres in Europe. At his death, three years after his retirement from Drury Lane and the stage, he was given a lavish public funeral at [[Westminster Abbey]] where he was laid to rest in [[Poets' Corner]].\n\nAs an actor, Garrick promoted realistic acting that departed from the bombastic style that was entrenched when he first came to prominence. His acting delighted many audiences and his direction of many of the top actors of the English stage influenced their styles as well. During his tenure as manager of Drury Lane, Garrick also sought to reform audience behaviour. While this led to some discontent among the theatre-going public, many of his reforms eventually did take hold. Garrick also sought reform in production matters, bringing an overarching consistency to productions that included [[set design]], [[costumes]] and even [[special effects]].\n\nGarrick's influence extended into the literary side of theatre as well. Critics are almost unanimous in saying he was not a good playwright,{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} but his work in bringing Shakespeare to contemporary audiences is notable. In addition, he adapted many older plays in the repertoire that might have been forgotten. These included many plays of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era. Indeed, while influencing the theatre towards a better standard he also gained a better reputation for theatre people. This accomplishment led Samuel Johnson to remark that \"his profession made him rich and he made his profession respectable.\"\n\n==Early life==\nGarrick was born at the Angel Inn, Widemarsh Street, [[Hereford]]<ref>Text of plaque on site of Garrick Theatre, Hereford</ref> in 1717 into a family with [[French Huguenot]] roots in the [[Languedoc]] region of [[Southern France]]. His grandfather, David Garric, was in [[Bordeaux]] in 1685 when the [[Edict of Nantes]] was abolished, revoking the rights of [[Protestant]]s in France. Grandfather Garric fled to London and his son, Peter, who was an infant at the time, was later smuggled out by a nurse when he was deemed old enough to make the journey. Young David Garric became a British subject upon his arrival in Britain, and later Anglicised his name to Garrick.{{sfn|Kendall|1985|p=12}} Some time after David Garrick's birth the family moved to [[Lichfield]], home to his mother. His father, a captain in the army, was a recruiting officer stationed in [[Gibraltar]]{{sfn|Carruthers|Ward|1911|pp=475\u201377}} through most of young Garrick's childhood.\n\nGarrick was the third of seven children and his younger brother, George (1723\u20131779), served as an aide to David for the remainder of his life. The playwright and actor [[Charles Dibdin]] writes that George, when on occasion discovering his brother's absence, would often inquire \"Did David want me?\" Upon Garrick's death in 1779, it was noted that George died 48 hours later, leading some to speculate that David did indeed want him.{{sfn|Kendall|1985|p=13}}\n\nHis nephew, Nathan Garrick, married Martha Leigh, daughter of [[Sir Egerton Leigh, 1st Baronet|Sir Egerton Leigh]], and sister of Sir Samuel Egerton Leigh, author of ''Munster Abbey; a Romance: Interspersed with Reflections on Virtue and Morality'' (Edinburgh 1797).{{sfn|Bellot|1956|p=187}}\n\n[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick as Richard III - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Have mercy, Jesu! Soft! I did but dream.''<br/>''O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!'' \u2013 Shakespeare's ''Richard III'' Act V, Sc. 3.<br/>David Garrick in 1745 as Richard III just before the battle of [[Bosworth Field]], his sleep having been haunted by the ghosts of those he has murdered, wakes to the realisation that he is alone in the world and death is imminent. Painting by the English painter [[William Hogarth]].]]\nAt the age of 19, Garrick, who had been educated at [[Lichfield Grammar School]], enrolled in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s [[Edial Hall School]]. Garrick showed an enthusiasm for the theatre very early on and he appeared in a school production around this time in the role of Sergeant Kite in [[George Farquhar]]'s ''[[The Recruiting Officer]]''. After Johnson's school was closed, he and Garrick, now friends, travelled to London together to seek their fortunes. Upon his arrival in 1737, Garrick and his brother became partners in a wine business with operations in both London and Lichfield with David taking the London operation.<ref name=\"Hartnoll 1983, p. 315\">{{harvnb|Hartnoll|1983|p=315}}.</ref> The business did not flourish, possibly due to Garrick's distraction by amateur theatricals. Playwright [[Samuel Foote]] remarked that he had known Garrick to have only three quarts of vinegar in his cellar and still called himself a wine merchant.{{sfn|Carruthers|Ward|1911|pp=475\u201377}}\n\nIn 1740, four years after Garrick's arrival in London, and with his wine business failing, he saw his first play, a satire, ''Lethe: or Aesop in the Shade'', produced at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].{{sfn|Kendall|1985|p= 17}} Within a year he was appearing professionally, playing small parts at the [[Goodman's Fields Theatre]] under the management of [[Henry Giffard]]. The Goodman's Fields Theatre had been shuttered by the [[Licensing Act of 1737]] which closed all theatres that did not hold the [[patent theatre|letters patent]] and required all plays to be approved by the [[Lord Chamberlain]] before performance. Garrick's performances at the theatre were a result of Giffard's help with Garrick's wine business. Giffard had helped Garrick win the business of the [[Bedford Coffee-house]], an establishment patronised by many theatrical and literary people and a location Garrick frequented.{{sfn|Kendall|1985|p=19}}\n\n== Professional actor ==\n[[File:Joshua Reynolds, David Garrick between Tragedy and Comedy, 1760-61 at Waddesdon Manor.jpg|alt=Joshua Reynolds, ''David Garrick Between Tragedy and Comedy'', 1760\u201361 at Waddesdon Manor|left|thumb|Joshua Reynolds, ''[[David Garrick Between Tragedy and Comedy]]'', 1760\u201361 at [[Waddesdon Manor]]]]\nHe made his debut as a professional actor on a summer tour to [[Ipswich]] with Giffard's troupe in 1741, where he played Aboan in [[Oroonoko]]. He appeared under the stage name ''Lyddal'' to avoid the consternation of his family.{{sfn|Holland|1995|p=411}} But, while he was successful under Giffard, the managers of Drury Lane and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] rejected him.<ref name=\"Hartnoll 1983, p. 315\" /> On 19 October 1741, Garrick appeared in the title role of ''Richard III''. He had been coached in the role by the actor and playwright [[Charles Macklin]] and his natural performance, which rejected the declamatory acting style so prevalent in the period, soon was the talk of London. Of his performance at Goodman's Fields, [[Horace Walpole]] remarked, \"there was a dozen dukes a night at Goodman's Fields\".{{sfn|Carruthers|Ward|1911|pp=475\u2013477}} Following his rousing performance, Garrick wrote to his brother requesting withdrawal from the partnership to devote his time completely to the stage. Having found success with Richard III, Garrick moved onto a number of other roles including [[The History of King Lear|Tate's adaptation]] of Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]'' and Pierre in [[Thomas Otway|Otway's]] ''[[Venice Preserv'd]]'' as well as comic roles such as Bayes in [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham's]] ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]''; a total of 18 roles in all in just the first six months of his acting career. His success led [[Alexander Pope]], who saw him perform three times during this period, to surmise, \"that young man never had his equal as an actor, and he will never have a rival\".{{sfn|Carruthers|Ward|1911|pp=475\u2013477}}\n\nWith his success at Goodman's Fields, Charles Fleetwood, manager of Drury Lane, engaged Garrick to play Chaumont in Otway's ''The Orphan'' (a role he first played in Ipswich){{sfn|Woods|1996|p=291}} on 11 May 1742 while he used his [[letters patent]] to close down Giffard's theatre.{{sfn|Hartnoll|1983|p=231}} That same month, Garrick played King Lear opposite [[Margaret Woffington|Margaret \"Peg\" Woffington]] as [[Cordelia]] and his popular Richard III.{{sfn|Kendall|1985|p=27}} With these successes, Fleetwood engaged Garrick for the full 1742\u201343 season.<ref name=\"Hartnoll 1983, p. 315\" />\n\n== Drury Lane ==\n[[File:Zoffany-Garrick in The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Garrick (right) as Abel Drugger in Jonson's ''The Alchemist'' painted by [[Johann Zoffany]].]]\nAt the end of the London season, Garrick, along with Peg Woffington, travelled to [[Dublin]] for the summer season at the [[Theatre Royal, Dublin|Theatre Royal, Smock Lane]]. While in Dublin, Garrick added two new roles to his repertoire: Shakespeare's [[Hamlet]], Abel Drugger in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (a role that earned him much acclaim<ref name=\"Hartnoll 1983, p. 315\" />) and Captain Plume in Farquhar's ''The Recruiting Officer''.{{sfn|Woods|1996|p=291}} Some of his success could be attributed to one of his earliest fans, [[John Boyle, 5th Earl of Cork]], who wrote letters to many noblemen and gentlemen recommending Garrick's acting. His writings led Garrick to exclaim that it must have been the reason he was \"more caressed\" in Dublin.{{sfn|Kendall|1985|p=26}}\n\nFive years after joining the acting company at Drury Lane, Garrick again travelled to Dublin for a season where he managed and directed at the Smock Alley Theatre in conjunction with [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Thomas Sheridan]], the father of [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]. After his return to London, he spent some time acting at Covent Garden under [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] while a [[farce]] of his, ''[[Miss in Her Teens]]'', was also produced there.\n\nWith the end of the 1746\u20131747 season, Fleetwoods' patent on Drury Lane expired in partnership with [[James Lacy]], Garrick took over the theatre in April 1747. The theatre had been in a decline for some years, but the partnership of Garrick and Lacy led to success and accolades. The first performance under Garrick and Lacy's management opened with an ''Ode to Drury Lane Theatre, on dedicating a Building and erecting a Statue, to Shakespeare'' read by Garrick and written by his friend, Dr Johnson. The ode promised the patrons that \"The drama's law the drama's patrons give,/For we that live to please must please to live.\" Certainly this statement could be regarded as succinctly summing up Garrick's management at Drury Lane where he was able to balance both artistic integrity and the fickle tastes of the public.\n\n[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick (1717-79) with his wife Eva-Maria Veigel, \"La Violette\" or \"Violetti\" (1725 - 1822) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Garrick and his wife, Eva Marie Veigel, painted by [[William Hogarth]]. From the [[Royal Collection]], [[Windsor Castle]].]]\nAfter the Woffington affair there were a number of botched love affairs, including possibly fathering a son with [[Jane Green (actress)|Jane Green]].{{sfn|Batty|2004}} Garrick met [[Eva Marie Veigel]] (1724\u20131822), a German dancer in opera choruses who emigrated to London in 1746. The pair wed on 22 June 1749 and were preserved together in several portraits, including one by [[William Hogarth]]. Hogarth also made several drawings and paintings of them separately.  The union was childless but happy, Garrick calling her \"the best of women and wives\",{{sfn|Carruthers|Ward|1911|pp=475\u2013477}} and they were famously inseparable throughout their nearly 30 years of marriage. Garrick's increasing wealth enabled him to purchase a palatial estate for Eva Marie and himself to live in, naming it [[Garrick's Villa]], that he bought at [[Hampton, London|Hampton]] in 1754.{{sfn|Sheaf|Howe|1995|p=55}} He also indulged his passion for Shakespeare by building a [[Garrick's Temple to Shakespeare|Temple to Shakespeare]] on the riverside at Hampton to house his collection of memorabilia.{{sfn|Richmond Library staff|2011}}\n\nIn September 1769 Garrick staged the [[Shakespeare Jubilee]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].{{sfn|Pierce|2005|pp= 4\u201310}} It was a major focal point in the emerging movement that helped cement Shakespeare as England's [[national poet]]. It involved a number of events held in the town to celebrate (five years too late) 200 years since Shakespeare's birth. In a speech made on the second day of the Jubilee in Stratford Garrick recognized the [[Shakespeare Ladies Club]] as those who \"restor'd Shakespeare to the Stage,\" protecting his fame and erecting \"a Monument to his and your own honour in Westminster Abbey.\"<ref>qtd. in {{harvnb|Stochholm|1964|p=91}}.</ref> No Shakespeare plays were performed during the Jubilee, and heavy rain forced a Shakespeare Pageant to be called off. The Pageant was first staged a month later at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] under the title ''[[The Jubilee]]'' and proved successful enjoying 90 performances.{{sfn|Pierce|2005|pp=9\u201310}} The song \"[[Soft Flowing Avon]]\" was composed by [[Thomas Arne]], with lyrics by Garrick, for the Jubilee.\n\nGarrick would manage the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, until his retirement from management in 1776. In his last years he continued to add roles to his repertoire; Posthumus in ''[[Cymbeline]]'' was among his last famous roles.\n\n== Death ==\n\nShortly before his death he worked on the production of ''[[The Camp (play)|The Camp]]'' with Sheridan at Drury Lane and caught a very bad cold. ''The Camp'' was based around the British response to [[Armada of 1779|a threatened invasion by France]], leading some to jokingly claim that Garrick was the only casualty of the ultimately abandoned invasion.{{sfn|Ennis|Slagle|2007|p=217}}\n\nHe died less than three years after his retirement, at his house in [[Adelphi Buildings]], London,{{sfn|Greenway|1999|pp=81-82}} and was interred in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]. Mrs. Garrick survived her husband by 43 years.\n\n== Family ==\nHis great-grand-niece was the famous soprano [[Malvina Garrigues]]{{sfn|BSO staff|1909|page=554}} and her first cousin, the Danish-American doctor [[Henry Jacques Garrigues]].\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Kauffman-Garrick.jpg|thumb|left|David Garrick's portrait, by [[Angelica Kauffman|Kauffman]]]]\n\n=== An easy, natural manner ===\nPerhaps it was Garrick's acting, the most showy of his careers, that brought him the most adulation. Garrick was not a large man, only standing 5'4\", and his voice is not described as particularly loud. From his first performance, Garrick departed from the bombastic style that had been popular, choosing instead a more relaxed, naturalistic style that his biographer Alan Kendall states \"would probably seem quite normal to us today, but it was new and strange for his day.\" Certainly this new style brought acclaim: [[Alexander Pope]] stated, \"he was afraid the young man would be spoiled, for he would have no competitor.\" Garrick quotes [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|George Lyttelton]] as complimenting him by saying, \"He told me he never knew what acting was till I appeared.\" Even [[James Quin]], an actor in the old style remarked, \"If this young fellow be right, then we have been all wrong.\"\n\nWhile Garrick's praises were being sung by many, there were some detractors. [[Theophilus Cibber]] in his ''Two Dissertations on the Theatres'' of 1756 believed that Garrick's realistic style went too far:\n{{quote|his over-fondness for extravagant Attitudes, frequently affected Starts, convulsive Twitchings, Jerkings of the Body, Sprawling of the Fingers, slapping the Breast and Pockets:-A Set of mechanical Motions in constant Use-the Caricatures of gesture suggested by pert vivacity,-his pantomimical Manner of acting every Word in a Sentence, his Unnatural Pauses in the middle of a sentence; his forc'd Conceits; -his wilful Neglect of Harmony, even where the round Period of a well express'd Noble Sentiment demands a graceful Cadence in the delivery.{{sfn|Sechelski|1996|p=380}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Zoffany-Garrick in Provoked Wife.jpg|thumb|\"David Garrick in [[Vanbrugh]]'s ''[[Provoked Wife]]'', [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Theatre Royal]], Drury Lane\" by [[Johann Zoffany]], 1763.]]\nBut Garrick's legacy was perhaps best summarised by the historian [[Rev Nicolas Tindal]] when he said that:\n{{quote|The 'deaf' hear him in his 'action, and the 'blind' see him in his 'voice'.{{sfn|Nichols|Bentley|1812|p=554}}}}\n\n=== Memorials ===\n* A two-volume biography, ''Memoirs of the life of David Garrick, Esq. : interspersed with characters and anecdotes of his theatrical contemporaries : the whole forming a history of the stage, which includes a period of thirty-six years'', was written by Thomas Davies (ca. 1712-1785) <ref>[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008881814 Memoirs of the life of David Garrick, Esq. digital edition], available through [[HathiTrust]]</ref>\n*[[Garrick Club|The Garrick Club]] in London, named in his honour.\n*[[Garrick's Temple to Shakespeare]], built on ''Garrick's Lawn'' in the riverside gardens of his [[Garrick's Villa|Villa]] near [[Hampton Court]], now restored as a memorial to David Garrick and his life in [[Hampton, London]].\n*A monument to Garrick in [[Lichfield Cathedral]] bears Johnson's famous comment:\n{{quote|I am disappointed by that stroke of death that has eclipsed the gaiety of nations, and impoverished the public stock of harmless pleasure.{{sfn|Carruthers|Ward|1911|pp=475\u2013477}} }}\n*A carved stone medallion, a metre or more in diameter, showing Garrick is on display at [[Birmingham Central Library]].\n[[File:David Garrick by Robert Edge Pine.jpg|thumb|David Garrick's portrait, by [[Robert Edge Pine]]]]\n*Garrick was the first actor to be granted the honour of being buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], in Poets' Corner next to the monument to William Shakespeare.

He appeared in a number of amateur theatricals, and with his appearance in the title role of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', audiences and managers began to take notice.\n\nImpressed by his portrayals of Richard III and a number of other roles, [[Charles Fleetwood (manager)|Charles Fleetwood]] engaged Garrick for a season at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]. He remained with the [[Drury Lane]] company for the next five years and purchased a share of the theatre with [[James Lacy]]. This purchase inaugurated 29 years of Garrick's management of the Drury Lane, during which time it rose to prominence as one of the leading theatres in Europe. At his death, three years after his retirement from Drury Lane and the stage, he was given a lavish public funeral at [[Westminster Abbey]] where he was laid to rest in [[Poets' Corner]].\n\nAs an actor, Garrick promoted realistic acting that departed from the bombastic style that was entrenched when he first came to prominence. His acting delighted many audiences and his direction of many of the top actors of the English stage influenced their styles as well. During his tenure as manager of Drury Lane, Garrick also sought to reform audience behaviour. While this led to some discontent among the theatre-going public, many of his reforms eventually did take hold. Garrick also sought reform in production matters, bringing an overarching consistency to productions that included [[set design]], [[costumes]] and even [[special effects]].\n\nGarrick's influence extended into the literary side of theatre as well. Critics are almost unanimous in saying he was not a good playwright,{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} but his work in bringing Shakespeare to contemporary audiences is notable. In addition, he adapted many older plays in the repertoire that might have been forgotten. These included many plays of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era. Indeed, while influencing the theatre towards a better standard he also gained a better reputation for theatre people. This accomplishment led Samuel Johnson to remark that \"his profession made him rich and he made his profession respectable.\"\n\n==Early life==\nGarrick was born at the Angel Inn, Widemarsh Street, [[Hereford]]<ref>Text of plaque on site of Garrick Theatre, Hereford</ref> in 1717 into a family with [[French Huguenot]] roots in the [[Languedoc]] region of [[Southern France]]. His grandfather, David Garric, was in [[Bordeaux]] in 1685 when the [[Edict of Nantes]] was abolished, revoking the rights of [[Protestant]]s in France. Grandfather Garric fled to London and his son, Peter, who was an infant at the time, was later smuggled out by a nurse when he was deemed old enough to make the journey. Young David Garric became a British subject upon his arrival in Britain, and later Anglicised his name to Garrick.{{sfn|Kendall|1985|p=12}} Some time after David Garrick's birth the family moved to [[Lichfield]], home to his mother. His father, a captain in the army, was a recruiting officer stationed in [[Gibraltar]]{{sfn|Carruthers|Ward|1911|pp=475\u201377}} through most of young Garrick's childhood.\n\nGarrick was the third of seven children and his younger brother, George (1723\u20131779), served as an aide to David for the remainder of his life. The playwright and actor [[Charles Dibdin]] writes that George, when on occasion discovering his brother's absence, would often inquire \"Did David want me?\" Upon Garrick's death in 1779, it was noted that George died 48 hours later, leading some to speculate that David did indeed want him.{{sfn|Kendall|1985|p=13}}\n\nHis nephew, Nathan Garrick, married Martha Leigh, daughter of [[Sir Egerton Leigh, 1st Baronet|Sir Egerton Leigh]], and sister of Sir Samuel Egerton Leigh, author of ''Munster Abbey; a Romance: Interspersed with Reflections on Virtue and Morality'' (Edinburgh 1797).{{sfn|Bellot|1956|p=187}}\n\n[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick as Richard III - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Have mercy, Jesu!

Painting by the English painter [[William Hogarth]].]]\nAt the age of 19, Garrick, who had been educated at [[Lichfield Grammar School]], enrolled in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s [[Edial Hall School]]. Garrick showed an enthusiasm for the theatre very early on and he appeared in a school production around this time in the role of Sergeant Kite in [[George Farquhar]]'s ''[[The Recruiting Officer]]''. After Johnson's school was closed, he and Garrick, now friends, travelled to London together to seek their fortunes. Upon his arrival in 1737, Garrick and his brother became partners in a wine business with operations in both London and Lichfield with David taking the London operation.<ref name=\"Hartnoll 1983, p. 315\">{{harvnb|Hartnoll|1983|p=315}}.</ref> The business did not flourish, possibly due to Garrick's distraction by amateur theatricals. Playwright [[Samuel Foote]] remarked that he had known Garrick to have only three quarts of vinegar in his cellar and still called himself a wine merchant.{{sfn|Carruthers|Ward|1911|pp=475\u201377}}\n\nIn 1740, four years after Garrick's arrival in London, and with his wine business failing, he saw his first play, a satire, ''Lethe: or Aesop in the Shade'', produced at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].{{sfn|Kendall|1985|p= 17}} Within a year he was appearing professionally, playing small parts at the [[Goodman's Fields Theatre]] under the management of [[Henry Giffard]]. The Goodman's Fields Theatre had been shuttered by the [[Licensing Act of 1737]] which closed all theatres that did not hold the [[patent theatre|letters patent]] and required all plays to be approved by the [[Lord Chamberlain]] before performance. Garrick's performances at the theatre were a result of Giffard's help with Garrick's wine business. Giffard had helped Garrick win the business of the [[Bedford Coffee-house]], an establishment patronised by many theatrical and literary people and a location Garrick frequented.{{sfn|Kendall|1985|p=19}}\n\n== Professional actor ==\n[[File:Joshua Reynolds, David Garrick between Tragedy and Comedy, 1760-61 at Waddesdon Manor.jpg|alt=Joshua Reynolds, ''David Garrick Between Tragedy and Comedy'', 1760\u201361 at Waddesdon Manor|left|thumb|Joshua Reynolds, ''[[David Garrick Between Tragedy and Comedy]]'', 1760\u201361 at [[Waddesdon Manor]]]]\nHe made his debut as a professional actor on a summer tour to [[Ipswich]] with Giffard's troupe in 1741, where he played Aboan in [[Oroonoko]]. He appeared under the stage name ''Lyddal'' to avoid the consternation of his family.{{sfn|Holland|1995|p=411}} But, while he was successful under Giffard, the managers of Drury Lane and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] rejected him.<ref name=\"Hartnoll 1983, p. 315\" /> On 19 October 1741, Garrick appeared in the title role of ''Richard III''. He had been coached in the role by the actor and playwright [[Charles Macklin]] and his natural performance, which rejected the declamatory acting style so prevalent in the period, soon was the talk of London. Of his performance at Goodman's Fields, [[Horace Walpole]] remarked, \"there was a dozen dukes a night at Goodman's Fields\".{{sfn|Carruthers|Ward|1911|pp=475\u2013477}} Following his rousing performance, Garrick wrote to his brother requesting withdrawal from the partnership to devote his time completely to the stage. Having found success with Richard III, Garrick moved onto a number of other roles including [[The History of King Lear|Tate's adaptation]] of Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]'' and Pierre in [[Thomas Otway|Otway's]] ''[[Venice Preserv'd]]'' as well as comic roles such as Bayes in [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham's]] ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]''; a total of 18 roles in all in just the first six months of his acting career. His success led [[Alexander Pope]], who saw him perform three times during this period, to surmise, \"that young man never had his equal as an actor, and he will never have a rival\".{{sfn|Carruthers|Ward|1911|pp=475\u2013477}}\n\nWith his success at Goodman's Fields, Charles Fleetwood, manager of Drury Lane, engaged Garrick to play Chaumont in Otway's ''The Orphan'' (a role he first played in Ipswich){{sfn|Woods|1996|p=291}} on 11 May 1742 while he used his [[letters patent]] to close down Giffard's theatre.{{sfn|Hartnoll|1983|p=231}} That same month, Garrick played King Lear opposite [[Margaret Woffington|Margaret \"Peg\" Woffington]] as [[Cordelia]] and his popular Richard III.{{sfn|Kendall|1985|p=27}} With these successes, Fleetwood engaged Garrick for the full 1742\u201343 season.<ref name=\"Hartnoll 1983, p. 315\" />\n\n== Drury Lane ==\n[[File:Zoffany-Garrick in The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Garrick (right) as Abel Drugger in Jonson's ''The Alchemist'' painted by [[Johann Zoffany]].]]\nAt the end of the London season, Garrick, along with Peg Woffington, travelled to [[Dublin]] for the summer season at the [[Theatre Royal, Dublin|Theatre Royal, Smock Lane]]. While in Dublin, Garrick added two new roles to his repertoire: Shakespeare's [[Hamlet]], Abel Drugger in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (a role that earned him much acclaim<ref name=\"Hartnoll 1983, p. 315\" />) and Captain Plume in Farquhar's ''The Recruiting Officer''.{{sfn|Woods|1996|p=291}} Some of his success could be attributed to one of his earliest fans, [[John Boyle, 5th Earl of Cork]], who wrote letters to many noblemen and gentlemen recommending Garrick's acting. His writings led Garrick to exclaim that it must have been the reason he was \"more caressed\" in Dublin.{{sfn|Kendall|1985|p=26}}\n\nFive years after joining the acting company at Drury Lane, Garrick again travelled to Dublin for a season where he managed and directed at the Smock Alley Theatre in conjunction with [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Thomas Sheridan]], the father of [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]. After his return to London, he spent some time acting at Covent Garden under [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] while a [[farce]] of his, ''[[Miss in Her Teens]]'', was also produced there.\n\nWith the end of the 1746\u20131747 season, Fleetwoods' patent on Drury Lane expired in partnership with [[James Lacy]], Garrick took over the theatre in April 1747. The theatre had been in a decline for some years, but the partnership of Garrick and Lacy led to success and accolades. The first performance under Garrick and Lacy's management opened with an ''Ode to Drury Lane Theatre, on dedicating a Building and erecting a Statue, to Shakespeare'' read by Garrick and written by his friend, Dr. Johnson. The ode promised the patrons that \"The drama's law the drama's patrons give,/For we that live to please must please to live.\" Certainly this statement could be regarded as succinctly summing up Garrick's management at Drury Lane where he was able to balance both artistic integrity and the fickle tastes of the public.\n\n[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick (1717-79) with his wife Eva-Maria Veigel, \"La Violette\" or \"Violetti\" (1725 - 1822) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Garrick and his wife, Eva Marie Veigel, painted by [[William Hogarth]]. From the [[Royal Collection]], [[Windsor Castle]].]]\nAfter the Woffington affair there were a number of botched love affairs, including possibly fathering a son with [[Jane Green (actress)|Jane Green]].{{sfn|Batty|2004}} Garrick met [[Eva Marie Veigel]] (1724\u20131822), a German dancer in opera choruses who emigrated to London in 1746. The pair wed on 22 June 1749 and were preserved together in several portraits, including one by [[William Hogarth]]. Hogarth also made several drawings and paintings of them separately.  The union was childless but happy, Garrick calling her \"the best of women and wives\",{{sfn|Carruthers|Ward|1911|pp=475\u2013477}} and they were famously inseparable throughout their nearly 30 years of marriage. Garrick's increasing wealth enabled him to purchase a palatial estate for Eva Marie and himself to live in, naming it [[Garrick's Villa]], that he bought at [[Hampton, London|Hampton]] in 1754.{{sfn|Sheaf|Howe|1995|p=55}} He also indulged his passion for Shakespeare by building a [[Garrick's Temple to Shakespeare|Temple to Shakespeare]] on the riverside at Hampton to house his collection of memorabilia.{{sfn|Richmond Library staff|2011}}\n\nIn September 1769 Garrick staged the [[Shakespeare Jubilee]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].{{sfn|Pierce|2005|pp= 4\u201310}} It was a major focal point in the emerging movement that helped cement Shakespeare as England's [[national poet]]. It involved a number of events held in the town to celebrate (five years too late) 200 years since Shakespeare's birth. In a speech made on the second day of the Jubilee in Stratford Garrick recognized the [[Shakespeare Ladies Club]] as those who \"restor'd Shakespeare to the Stage,\" protecting his fame and erecting \"a Monument to his and your own honour in Westminster Abbey.\"<ref>qtd. in {{harvnb|Stochholm|1964|p=91}}.</ref> No Shakespeare plays were performed during the Jubilee, and heavy rain forced a Shakespeare Pageant to be called off. The Pageant was first staged a month later at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] under the title ''[[The Jubilee]]'' and proved successful enjoying 90 performances.{{sfn|Pierce|2005|pp=9\u201310}} The song \"[[Soft Flowing Avon]]\" was composed by [[Thomas Arne]], with lyrics by Garrick, for the Jubilee.\n\nGarrick would manage the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, until his retirement from management in 1776. In his last years he continued to add roles to his repertoire; Posthumus in ''[[Cymbeline]]'' was among his last famous roles.\n\n== Death ==\n\nShortly before his death he worked on the production of ''[[The Camp (play)|The Camp]]'' with Sheridan at Drury Lane and caught a very bad cold. ''The Camp'' was based around the British response to [[Armada of 1779|a threatened invasion by France]], leading some to jokingly claim that Garrick was the only casualty of the ultimately abandoned invasion.{{sfn|Ennis|Slagle|2007|p=217}}\n\nHe died less than three years after his retirement, at his house in [[Adelphi Buildings]], London,{{sfn|Greenway|1999|pp=81-82}} and was interred in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]. Mrs. Garrick survived her husband by 43 years.\n\n== Family ==\nHis great-grand-niece was the famous soprano [[Malvina Garrigues]]{{sfn|BSO staff|1909|page=554}} and her first cousin, the Danish-American doctor [[Henry Jacques Garrigues]].\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Kauffman-Garrick.jpg|thumb|left|David Garrick's portrait, by [[Angelica Kauffman|Kauffman]]]]\n\n=== An easy, natural manner ===\nPerhaps it was Garrick's acting, the most showy of his careers, that brought him the most adulation. Garrick was not a large man, only standing 5'4\", and his voice is not described as particularly loud. From his first performance, Garrick departed from the bombastic style that had been popular, choosing instead a more relaxed, naturalistic style that his biographer Alan Kendall states \"would probably seem quite normal to us today, but it was new and strange for his day.\" Certainly this new style brought acclaim: [[Alexander Pope]] stated, \"he was afraid the young man would be spoiled, for he would have no competitor.\" Garrick quotes [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|George Lyttelton]] as complimenting him by saying, \"He told me he never knew what acting was till I appeared.\" Even [[James Quin]], an actor in the old style remarked, \"If this young fellow be right, then we have been all wrong.\"\n\nWhile Garrick's praises were being sung by many, there were some detractors. [[Theophilus Cibber]] in his ''Two Dissertations on the Theatres'' of 1756 believed that Garrick's realistic style went too far:\n{{quote|his over-fondness for extravagant Attitudes, frequently affected Starts, convulsive Twitchings, Jerkings of the Body, Sprawling of the Fingers, slapping the Breast and Pockets:-A Set of mechanical Motions in constant Use-the Caricatures of gesture suggested by pert vivacity,-his pantomimical Manner of acting every Word in a Sentence, his Unnatural Pauses in the middle of a sentence; his forc'd Conceits; -his wilful Neglect of Harmony, even where the round Period of a well express'd Noble Sentiment demands a graceful Cadence in the delivery.{{sfn|Sechelski|1996|p=380}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Zoffany-Garrick in Provoked Wife.jpg|thumb|\"David Garrick in [[Vanbrugh]]'s ''[[Provoked Wife]]'', [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Theatre Royal]], Drury Lane\" by [[Johann Zoffany]], 1763.]]\nBut Garrick's legacy was perhaps best summarised by the historian [[Rev Nicolas Tindal]] when he said that:\n{{quote|The 'deaf' hear him in his 'action, and the 'blind' see him in his 'voice'.{{sfn|Nichols|Bentley|1812|p=554}}}}\n\n=== Memorials ===\n* A two-volume biography, ''Memoirs of the life of David Garrick, Esq. : interspersed with characters and anecdotes of his theatrical contemporaries : the whole forming a history of the stage, which includes a period of thirty-six years'', was written by Thomas Davies (ca. 1712-1785) <ref>[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008881814 Memoirs of the life of David Garrick, Esq. digital edition], available through [[HathiTrust]]</ref>\n*[[Garrick Club|The Garrick Club]] in London, named in his honour.\n*[[Garrick's Temple to Shakespeare]], built on ''Garrick's Lawn'' in the riverside gardens of his [[Garrick's Villa|Villa]] near [[Hampton Court]], now restored as a memorial to David Garrick and his life in [[Hampton, London]].\n*A monument to Garrick in [[Lichfield Cathedral]] bears Johnson's famous comment:\n{{quote|I am disappointed by that stroke of death that has eclipsed the gaiety of nations, and impoverished the public stock of harmless pleasure.{{sfn|Carruthers|Ward|1911|pp=475\u2013477}} }}\n*A carved stone medallion, a metre or more in diameter, showing Garrick is on display at [[Birmingham Central Library]].\n[[File:David Garrick by Robert Edge Pine.jpg|thumb|David Garrick's portrait, by [[Robert Edge Pine]]]]\n*Garrick was the first actor to be granted the honour of being buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], in Poets' Corner next to the monument to William Shakespeare.

Veer finds no sign of his brother, and sets out to investigate, only to find deceit, murder, and that his very own life in danger.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dev Anand]] as Veer Sahni\n*[[Pran (actor)|Pran]] as Samir Sahni\n*[[Gajanan Jagirdar]] as Mr. Sahni\n*[[Indrani Mukherjee]] as Rama Sahni\n*[[Ajit Khan]] as Gurnam\n*[[Tom Alter]] as Inspector Martin\n*[[Bindu (actress)|Bindu]] as Sylvia\n*[[Prem Chopra]] as Bansilal\n*[[A.
