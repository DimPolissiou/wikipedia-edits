It was one of a few tours in her then-sixteen-year career and was named after a fan's \"Carey-centric\" diary of the same name.<ref>MSN [https://www.today.com/popculture/mariah-carey-takes-madonna-new-tour-wbna14190642 Mariah Carey takes on Madonna with new tour]</ref> The bus tour started in late July and ended in October, with two stops in Africa, twenty-five stops in the United States, seven in Canada, and seven in Asia. At the end of 2006, the tour placed 24th on Pollstar's \"Top 100 Tours\", earning $27.9 million with 32 shows from the North American leg.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pollstarpro.com/specialfeatures2006/2006%20Year%20End%20Top%20100%20Tours.pdf |title=Pollstar Top 100 Tours 2006 |publisher=[[Pollstar]] |accessdate=28 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Mariah Carey in August 2006 2.jpg|thumb|left|Mariah Carey performing in [[Tampa, Florida]] on August 7, 2006.]]Unlike [[Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey|her previous tour]], three years prior, Carey started this tour 16 months after the release of her latest album, the successful ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]''. She had initially not wanted to tour, dreading the long travel times and not needing one to promote ''Mimi''. But after requests from fans to appear in concert, she decided to do so to celebrate one of the best times in her career.<ref name=\"AP\">Asbury Park Press, AP story by Nekesa Mumbi Moody, August 11, 2006.</ref>\n\nSimilar to the past tour, Carey gave her fans the chance to submit their ideas for set lists and for the title of the tour. Her long-time musical partner and ''[[American Idol]]'' judge [[Randy Jackson]] joined her tour as the musical director, although he did not often appear at shows due to concurrent ''Idol'' auditions.\n\nDuring the tour, Carey revamped her image as a performer, performing remixes of her songs, dancing along a bit with her dancers, having guests onstage, and going into the middle of each arena onto a checkerboard [[B-stage]] to perform \"[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]\", \"[[Always Be My Baby]]\" and \"[[Don't Forget About Us]].\" (The B stage had become an increasing popular way for large-venue performers to get closer to their audience ever since [[U2]] introduced it on their 1992 [[Zoo TV Tour]].) The main stage was a two-level affair, with the band situated on the lower level, backed by strands of glittering material, and a staircase between the two. Carey's \"MC\" logo was present in several places.\n[[File:Mariah Carey in August 2006 3.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Mariah Carey performing with the first costume.]]\nOnce again, Carey invited her long-time friend and back-up singer [[Trey Lorenz]] to sing \"[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)#Mariah Carey version|I'll Be There]]\" and \"[[One Sweet Day]]\" with her and perform several songs on his own during one of her costume changes. Except for an occasional guest appearance, raps on her songs were the pre-recorded originals, with the rapper shown on the video screens.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nReviews of the tour were generally positive. Most critics celebrated Carey's transformation from a pop star to a full-fledged hip hop artist. They also praised her vocal performances saying that was the main attraction of the spectacle.<ref name=\"newsday\" /><ref>The Detroit News [http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060910/ENT01/609100341 Mariah was on fire in her 1st Metro show]</ref>\n\nSome critics commented on the short length of the show, especially given that she was offstage for several breaks while undergoing costume changes,<ref>The Connecticut Post [http://www.connpost.com/ci_4251288 Mariah Carey concert disappointing]

Jackson]], the show at [[Honda Center]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] on October 8, 2006 was intended as the basis for a concert filming and subsequent DVD release.\nIndeed, Carey held a pre-concert taping there, in order to include fans, regulate the lighting, and review other technical aspects in preparation for the night's actual concert recording.\n\nThe resulting DVD, called ''[[The Adventures of Mimi (video)|The Adventures of Mimi]]'', was released over a year later, beginning in Europe on November 19, 2007, with releases in other regions of the world coming over the following two weeks.\n\n== Set list ==\n\n# \"Rollercoaster\" <small>(Video introduction)</small>\n# \"[[It's Like That (Mariah Carey song)|It's Like That]]\" <small>(With elements of \"[[Sucker

She had initially not wanted to tour, dreading the long travel times and not needing one to promote ''Mimi''. But after requests from fans to appear in concert, she decided to do so to celebrate one of the best times in her career.<ref name=\"AP\">Asbury Park Press, AP story by Nekesa Mumbi Moody, August 11, 2006.</ref>\n\nSimilar to the past tour, Carey gave her fans the chance to submit their ideas for set lists and for the title of the tour. Her long-time musical partner and ''[[American Idol]]'' judge [[Randy Jackson]] joined her tour as the musical director, although he did not often appear at shows due to concurrent ''Idol'' auditions.\n\nDuring the tour, Carey revamped her image as a performer, performing remixes of her songs, dancing along a bit with her dancers, having guests onstage, and going into the middle of each arena onto a checkerboard [[B-stage]] to perform \"[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]\", \"[[Always Be My Baby]]\" and \"[[Don't Forget About Us]].\" (The B stage had become an increasing popular way for large-venue performers to get closer to their audience ever since [[U2]] introduced it on their 1992 [[Zoo TV Tour]].) The main stage was a two-level affair, with the band situated on the lower level, backed by strands of glittering material, and a staircase between the two. Carey's \"MC\" logo was present in several places.\n[[File:Mariah Carey in August 2006 3.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Mariah Carey performing with the first costume.]]\nOnce again, Carey invited her long-time friend and back-up singer [[Trey Lorenz]] to sing \"[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)#Mariah Carey version|I'll Be There]]\" and \"[[One Sweet Day]]\" with her and perform several songs on his own during one of her costume changes. Except for an occasional guest appearance, raps on her songs were the pre-recorded originals, with the rapper shown on the video screens.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nReviews of the tour were generally positive. Most critics celebrated Carey's transformation from a pop star to a full-fledged hip hop artist. They also praised her vocal performances saying that was the main attraction of the spectacle.<ref name=\"newsday\" /><ref>The Detroit News

Jackson]], the show at [[Honda Center]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] on October 8, 2006 was intended as the basis for a concert filming and subsequent DVD release.\nIndeed, Carey held a pre-concert taping there, in order to include fans, regulate the lighting, and review other technical aspects in preparation for the night's actual concert recording.\n\nThe resulting DVD, called ''[[The Adventures of Mimi (video)|The Adventures of Mimi]]'', was released over a year later, beginning in Europe on November 19, 2007, with releases in other regions of the world coming over the

Evolutionary economics analyses the unleashing of a process of technological and institutional innovation by generating and testing a diversity of ideas which discover and accumulate more survival value for the costs incurred than competing alternatives. The evidence suggests that it could be [[Adaptive market hypothesis|adaptive efficiency]] that defines economic efficiency. [[Mainstream economics|Mainstream]] economic reasoning begins with the postulates of [[scarcity]] and [[rational agent]]s (that is, agents modeled as maximizing their individual welfare), with the \"[[rational choice]]\" for any agent being a straightforward  [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] in [[mathematical optimization]]. There has been renewed interest in treating economic systems as evolutionary systems in the developing field of [[Complexity economics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nEvolutionary economics does not take the characteristics of either the objects of choice or of the decision-maker as fixed. Rather its focus is on the non-equilibrium ''processes'' that transform the economy ''from within'' and their implications.  The processes in turn emerge from actions of diverse agents with [[bounded rationality]] who may learn from experience and interactions and whose differences contribute to the change.  The subject draws more recently on [[evolutionary game theory]]<ref>Daniel Friedman (1998).  \"On Economic Applications of Evolutionary Game Theory,\" ''Journal of Evolutionary Economics'', 8(1), pp. [https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs001910050054 15]-43.</ref> and on the [[evolution]]ary methodology of [[Charles Darwin]] and the [[non-equilibrium economics]] principle of circular and cumulative causation. It is [[Natural science|naturalistic]] in purging earlier notions of economic change as [[teleology|teleological]] or necessarily improving the human condition.<ref>Ulrich Witt (2008). \"evolutionary economics.\" ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, v. 3,  pp. 67-68 [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000295&q=evolutinary%20economics&topicid=&result_number=1 Abstract.]</ref>\n\nA different approach is to apply [[evolutionary psychology]] principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in [[rational choice theory]].

Inferior systems were beset by internal contradictions and [[Inefficiency|inefficiencies]] that make them impossible to survive over the long term. In Marx's scheme, [[feudalism]] was replaced by [[capitalism]], which would eventually be superseded by [[socialism]].<ref name=\"ComparingEconomicSystems\">''Gregory and Stuart''. (2005) ''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', Seventh Edition, South-Western College Publishing, {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}</ref>\n\nAt approximately the same time, [[Charles Darwin]] developed a general framework for comprehending any process whereby small, [[random variation]]s could accumulate and predominate over time into large-scale changes that resulted in the emergence of wholly novel forms (\"[[speciation]]\").\n\nThis was followed shortly after by the work of the American pragmatic philosophers ([[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]], [[William James|James]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]]) and the founding of two new disciplines, [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]], both of which were oriented toward cataloging and developing explanatory frameworks for the variety of [[behavior]] patterns (both individual and collective) that were becoming increasingly obvious to all systematic observers. The state of the world converged with the state of the evidence to make almost inevitable the development of a more \"modern\" framework for the analysis of substantive economic issues.\n\n=== Veblen (1898) ===\n\n[[Thorstein Veblen]] (1898) coined the term \"evolutionary economics\" in English. He began his career in the midst of this period of intellectual ferment, and as a young scholar came into direct contact with some of the leading figures of the various movements that were to shape the style and substance of [[social science]]s into the next century and beyond. Veblen saw the need for taking account of cultural variation in his approach; no universal \"human nature\" could possibly be invoked to explain the variety of norms and behaviors that the new science of anthropology showed to be the rule, rather than the exception. He emphasised the conflict between \"industrial\" and \"pecuniary\" or ceremonial values and this [[Veblenian dichotomy]] was interpreted in the hands of later writers as the \"ceremonial / instrumental dichotomy\" (Hodgson 2004);\n\nVeblen saw that every culture is materially based and dependent on tools and skills to support the \"life process\", while at the same time, every culture appeared to have a stratified structure of status (\"invidious distinctions\") that ran entirely contrary to the imperatives of the \"instrumental\" (read: \"technological\") aspects of group life. The \"ceremonial\" was related to the past, and conformed to and supported the tribal legends; \"instrumental\" was oriented toward the technological imperative to judge value by the ability to control future consequences. The \"Veblenian dichotomy\" was a specialized variant of the \"[[Instrumentalism|instrumental]] theory of value\" due to John Dewey, with whom Veblen was to make contact briefly at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nArguably the most important works by Veblen include, but are not restricted to, his most famous works (''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]''; ''[[The Theory of Business Enterprise]]''), but his monograph ''Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution'' and the 1898 essay entitled ''Why is Economics not an Evolutionary Science'' have both been influential in shaping the research agenda for following generations of [[social scientist]]s. TOLC and TOBE together constitute an alternative construction on the neoclassical marginalist theories of consumption and production, respectively.\n\nBoth are founded on his dichotomy, which is at its core a valuational principle. The ceremonial patterns of activity are not bound to any past, but to one that generated a specific set of advantages and prejudices that underlie the current institutions. \"Instrumental\" judgments create benefits according to a new criterion, and therefore are inherently subversive. This line of analysis was more fully and explicitly developed by [[Clarence E. Ayres]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]] from the 1920s.\n\nA seminal article by [[Armen Alchian]] (1950) argued for adaptive success of firms faced with uncertainty and incomplete information replacing [[profit maximization]] as an appropriate modeling assumption.<ref>Armen A. Alchian 1950, \"Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory,\" ''Journal of Political Economy'', 58(3), pp. [http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/syllabi/Econ811JournalArticles/AlchianJPE.pdf 211-21] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501230715/http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/syllabi/Econ811JournalArticles/AlchianJPE.pdf |date=2015-05-01 }}.</ref> [[Kenneth Boulding]] was one of the advocates of the evolutionary methods in social science, as is evident from [[Kenneth Boulding's Evolutionary Perspective]]. [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Ronald Coase]] and [[Douglass North]] are some of the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] winners who are known for their sympathy to the field.\n\nMore narrowly the works [[Jack Downie]]<ref>Jack Downie (1958) The Competitive Process</ref> and [[Edith Penrose]]<ref>E. Penrose (1959) The Theory of the Growth of the Firm</ref> offer many insights for those thinking about evolution at the level of the firm in an industry.\n\n[[Joseph Schumpeter]], who lived in the first half of 20th century, was the author of the book ''The Theory of Economic Development'' (1911, transl. 1934). It is important to note that for the word ''development'' he used in his native language, the German word \"Entwicklung\", which can be translated as development or evolution. The translators of the day used the word \"development\" from the French \"d\u00e9veloppement\", as opposed to \"evolution\" as this was used by Darwin. (Schumpeter, in his later writings in English as a professor at Harvard, used the word \"evolution\".)  The current term in common use is [[economic development]].\n\nIn Schumpeter's book he proposed an idea radical for its time: the evolutionary perspective. He based his theory on the assumption of usual [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], which is something like \"the normal mode of economic affairs\". This equilibrium is being perpetually destroyed by [[entrepreneur]]s who try to introduce [[innovation]]s. A successful introduction of an innovation (i.e. a [[disruptive technology]]) disturbs the normal flow of economic life, because it forces some of the already existing technologies and means of production to lose their positions within the economy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n== Present state of discussion ==\nOne of the major contributions to the emerging field of evolutionary economics has been the publication of ''An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change'' by [[Richard R. Nelson (economist)|Richard Nelson]] and [[Sidney G. Winter]]. These authors have focused mostly on the issue of changes in [[technology]] and [[Business process|routines]], suggesting a framework for their analysis. If the change occurs constantly in the economy, then some kind of evolutionary process must be in action, and there has been a proposal that this process is [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] in nature.\n\nThen, mechanisms that provide [[Selection (biology)|selection]], generate [[Genetic variation|variation]] and establish [[self-replication]], must be identified. The authors introduced the term '[[steady change]]' to highlight the evolutionary aspect of economic processes and contrast it with the concept of '[[steady state]]' popular in [[classical economics]].<ref>[[Steady change]]</ref> Their approach can be compared and contrasted with the [[population ecology]] or [[organizational ecology]] approach in sociology: see Douma & Schreuder (2013, chapter 11).

Nelson |Nelson]], [[Giovanni Dosi|Dosi]], Pyka, Malerba, Winter and other scholars have been proposing an update of the state-of-art in evolutionary economics<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Richard R.

Specifically, they argue that in the early stages of development, risk-tolerant entrepreneurial traits generated an evolutionary advantage, and the rise in the prevalence  of this trait amplified the pace of the growth process. However, in advanced stages of development, risk-aversion gained an evolutionary advantage, and contributed to convergence across countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Galor|first=Oded|last2=Michalopoulos|first2=Stelios|date=2012|title=Evolution and the growth process: Natural selection of entrepreneurial traits|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=147|issue=2|pages=759\u2013780|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jet.2011.04.005}}</ref>\n\n== Evolutionary psychology ==\n{{See also|Behavioral economics|Neuroeconomics}}\nA different approach is to apply [[evolutionary psychology]] principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in [[rational choice theory]]. A basic economic concept such as [[utility]] may be better explained in terms of a set of biological preferences that maximized evolutionary [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one. In other words, the preferences for actions/decisions that promise \"utility\" (e.g. reaching for a piece of cake) were formed in the ancestral environment because of the adaptive advantages of such decisions (e.g. maximizing calorie intake). [[Loss aversion]] may be explained as being rational when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may have meant death and it thus may have been rational to place a greater value on losses than on gains.<ref name=\"AEP\"/>\n\nPeople are sometimes more cooperative and altruistic than predicted by economic theory which may be explained by mechanisms such as [[reciprocal altruism]] and [[group selection]] for cooperative behavior. An evolutionary approach may also explain differences between groups such as males being less risk-averse than females since males have more variable [[reproductive success]] than females. While unsuccessful risk-seeking may limit reproductive success for both sexes, males may potentially increase their reproductive success much more than females from successful risk-seeking. [[Frequency-dependent selection]] may explain why people differ in characteristics such as cooperative behavior with cheating becoming an increasingly less successful strategy as the numbers of cheaters increase.<ref name=\"AEP\"/>\n\nAnother argument is that humans have a poor intuitive grasp of the economics of the current environment which is very different from the ancestral environment. The ancestral environment likely had relatively little [[trade]], [[division of labor]], and [[capital good]]s. Technological change was very slow, wealth differences were much smaller, and possession of many available resources were likely [[zero-sum]] games where large inequalities were caused by various forms of exploitation. Humans therefore may have poor intuitive understanding the benefits of [[free trade]] (causing calls for [[protectionism]]), the value of capital goods (making the [[labor theory of value]] appealing), and may intuitively undervalue the benefits of technological development.<ref name=\"AEP\"/>\n\nThere may be a tendency to see the number of available jobs as a zero-sum game with the total number of jobs being fixed which causes people to not realize that [[minimum wage]] laws reduce the number of jobs or to believe that an increased number of jobs in other nations necessarily decreases the number of jobs in their own nation. Large [[income inequality]] may easily be viewed as due to exploitation rather than as due to individual differences in [[productivity]]. This may easily cause poor economic policies, especially since individual voters have few incentives to make the effort of studying societal economics instead of relying on their intuitions since an individual's vote counts for so little and since politicians may be reluctant to take a stand against intuitive views that are incorrect but widely held.<ref name=AEP/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Business and economics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}} \n* [[Behavioral economics]]\n* [[Complexity economics]]\n* [[Creative destruction]]\n* [[Cultural economics]]\n* [[EAEPE]]\n* [[Ecological model of competition]]\n* [[Scientific socialism|Evolutionary socialism]]\n* [[Hypergamy]]\n* [[Institutional economics]]\n* [[Population dynamics]]\n* [[Innovation system]]\n* [[Non-equilibrium economics]]\n* [[Universal Darwinism]]\n* [[Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review]]\n* [[Giovanni Dosi]]\n* [[Robert H.

Evolutionary economics analyses the unleashing of a process of technological and institutional innovation by generating and testing a diversity of ideas which discover and accumulate more survival value for the costs incurred than competing alternatives. The evidence suggests that it could be [[Adaptive market hypothesis|adaptive efficiency]] that defines economic efficiency. [[Mainstream economics|Mainstream]] economic reasoning begins with the postulates of [[scarcity]] and [[rational agent]]s (that is, agents modeled as maximizing their individual welfare), with the \"[[rational choice]]\" for any agent being a straightforward  [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] in [[mathematical optimization]]. There has been renewed interest in treating economic systems as evolutionary systems in the developing field of [[Complexity economics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nEvolutionary economics does not take the characteristics of either the objects of choice or of the decision-maker as fixed. Rather its focus is on the non-equilibrium ''processes'' that transform the economy ''from within'' and their implications.  The processes in turn emerge from actions of diverse agents with [[bounded rationality]] who may learn from experience and interactions and whose differences contribute to the change.  The subject draws more recently on [[evolutionary game theory]]<ref>Daniel Friedman (1998).  \"On Economic Applications of Evolutionary Game Theory,\" ''Journal of Evolutionary Economics'', 8(1), pp. [https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs001910050054 15]-43.</ref> and on the [[evolution]]ary methodology of [[Charles Darwin]] and the [[non-equilibrium economics]] principle of circular and cumulative causation. It is [[Natural science|naturalistic]] in purging earlier notions of economic change as [[teleology|teleological]] or necessarily improving the human condition.<ref>Ulrich Witt (2008). \"evolutionary economics.\" ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, v. 3,  pp. 67-68 [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000295&q=evolutinary%20economics&topicid=&result_number=1 Abstract.]</ref>\n\nA different approach is to apply [[evolutionary psychology]] principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in [[rational choice theory]].

Inferior systems were beset by internal contradictions and [[Inefficiency|inefficiencies]] that make them impossible to survive over the long term. In Marx's scheme, [[feudalism]] was replaced by [[capitalism]], which would eventually be superseded by [[socialism]].<ref name=\"ComparingEconomicSystems\">''Gregory and Stuart''. (2005) ''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', Seventh Edition, South-Western College Publishing, {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}</ref>\n\nAt approximately the same time, [[Charles Darwin]] developed a general framework for comprehending any process whereby small, [[random variation]]s could accumulate and predominate over time into large-scale changes that resulted in the emergence of wholly novel forms (\"[[speciation]]\").\n\nThis was followed shortly after by the work of the American pragmatic philosophers ([[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]], [[William James|James]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]]) and the founding of two new disciplines, [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]], both of which were oriented toward cataloging and developing explanatory frameworks for the variety of [[behavior]] patterns (both individual and collective) that were becoming increasingly obvious to all systematic observers. The state of the world converged with the state of the evidence to make almost inevitable the development of a more \"modern\" framework for the analysis of substantive economic issues.\n\n=== Veblen (1898) ===\n\n[[Thorstein Veblen]] (1898) coined the term \"evolutionary economics\" in English. He began his career in the midst of this period of intellectual ferment, and as a young scholar came into direct contact with some of the leading figures of the various movements that were to shape the style and substance of [[social science]]s into the next century and beyond. Veblen saw the need for taking account of cultural variation in his approach; no universal \"human nature\" could possibly be invoked to explain the variety of norms and behaviors that the new science of anthropology showed to be the rule, rather than the exception. He emphasised the conflict between \"industrial\" and \"pecuniary\" or ceremonial values and this [[Veblenian dichotomy]] was interpreted in the hands of later writers as the \"ceremonial / instrumental dichotomy\" (Hodgson 2004);\n\nVeblen saw that every culture is materially based and dependent on tools and skills to support the \"life process\", while at the same time, every culture appeared to have a stratified structure of status (\"invidious distinctions\") that ran entirely contrary to the imperatives of the \"instrumental\" (read: \"technological\") aspects of group life. The \"ceremonial\" was related to the past, and conformed to and supported the tribal legends; \"instrumental\" was oriented toward the technological imperative to judge value by the ability to control future consequences. The \"Veblenian dichotomy\" was a specialized variant of the \"[[Instrumentalism|instrumental]] theory of value\" due to John Dewey, with whom Veblen was to make contact briefly at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nArguably the most important works by Veblen include, but are not restricted to, his most famous works (''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]''; ''[[The Theory of Business Enterprise]]''), but his monograph ''Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution'' and the 1898 essay entitled ''Why is Economics not an Evolutionary Science'' have both been influential in shaping the research agenda for following generations of [[social scientist]]s. TOLC and TOBE together constitute an alternative construction on the neoclassical marginalist theories of consumption and production, respectively.\n\nBoth are founded on his dichotomy, which is at its core a valuational principle. The ceremonial patterns of activity are not bound to any past, but to one that generated a specific set of advantages and prejudices that underlie the current institutions. \"Instrumental\" judgments create benefits according to a new criterion, and therefore are inherently subversive. This line of analysis was more fully and explicitly developed by [[Clarence E. Ayres]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]] from the 1920s.\n\nA seminal article by [[Armen Alchian]] (1950) argued for adaptive success of firms faced with uncertainty and incomplete information replacing [[profit maximization]] as an appropriate modeling assumption.<ref>Armen A. Alchian 1950, \"Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory,\" ''Journal of Political Economy'', 58(3), pp. [http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/syllabi/Econ811JournalArticles/AlchianJPE.pdf 211-21] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501230715/http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/syllabi/Econ811JournalArticles/AlchianJPE.pdf |date=2015-05-01 }}.</ref> [[Kenneth Boulding]] was one of the advocates of the evolutionary methods in social science, as is evident from [[Kenneth Boulding's Evolutionary Perspective]]. [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Ronald Coase]] and [[Douglass North]] are some of the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] winners who are known for their sympathy to the field.\n\nMore narrowly the works [[Jack Downie]]<ref>Jack Downie (1958) The Competitive Process</ref> and [[Edith Penrose]]<ref>E. Penrose (1959) The Theory of the Growth of the Firm</ref> offer many insights for those thinking about evolution at the level of the firm in an industry.\n\n[[Joseph Schumpeter]], who lived in the first half of 20th century, was the author of the book ''The Theory of Economic Development'' (1911, transl. 1934). It is important to note that for the word ''development'' he used in his native language, the German word \"Entwicklung\", which can be translated as development or evolution. The translators of the day used the word \"development\" from the French \"d\u00e9veloppement\", as opposed to \"evolution\" as this was used by Darwin. (Schumpeter, in his later writings in English as a professor at Harvard, used the word \"evolution\".)  The current term in common use is [[economic development]].\n\nIn Schumpeter's book he proposed an idea radical for its time: the evolutionary perspective. He based his theory on the assumption of usual [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], which is something like \"the normal mode of economic affairs\". This equilibrium is being perpetually destroyed by [[entrepreneur]]s who try to introduce [[innovation]]s. A successful introduction of an innovation (i.e. a [[disruptive technology]]) disturbs the normal flow of economic life, because it forces some of the already existing technologies and means of production to lose their positions within the economy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n== Present state of discussion ==\nOne of the major contributions to the emerging field of evolutionary economics has been the publication of ''An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change'' by [[Richard R. Nelson (economist)|Richard Nelson]] and [[Sidney G. Winter]]. These authors have focused mostly on the issue of changes in [[technology]] and [[Business process|routines]], suggesting a framework for their analysis. If the change occurs constantly in the economy, then some kind of evolutionary process must be in action, and there has been a proposal that this process is [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] in nature.\n\nThen, mechanisms that provide [[Selection (biology)|selection]], generate [[Genetic variation|variation]] and establish [[self-replication]], must be identified. The authors introduced the term '[[steady change]]' to highlight the evolutionary aspect of economic processes and contrast it with the concept of '[[steady state]]' popular in [[classical economics]].<ref>[[Steady change]]</ref> Their approach can be compared and contrasted with the [[population ecology]] or [[organizational ecology]] approach in sociology: see Douma & Schreuder (2013, chapter 11). More recently, Nelson, Dosi, Pyka, Malerba, Winter and other scholars have been proposing an update of the state-of-art in evolutionary economics<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Richard R.

Specifically, they argue that in the early stages of development, risk-tolerant entrepreneurial traits generated an evolutionary advantage, and the rise in the prevalence  of this trait amplified the pace of the growth process. However, in advanced stages of development, risk-aversion gained an evolutionary advantage, and contributed to convergence across countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Galor|first=Oded|last2=Michalopoulos|first2=Stelios|date=2012|title=Evolution and the growth process: Natural selection of entrepreneurial traits|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=147|issue=2|pages=759\u2013780|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jet.2011.04.005}}</ref>\n\n== Evolutionary psychology ==\n{{See also|Behavioral economics|Neuroeconomics}}\nA different approach is to apply [[evolutionary psychology]] principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in [[rational choice theory]]. A basic economic concept such as [[utility]] may be better explained in terms of a set of biological preferences that maximized evolutionary [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one. In other words, the preferences for actions/decisions that promise \"utility\" (e.g. reaching for a piece of cake) were formed in the ancestral environment because of the adaptive advantages of such decisions (e.g. maximizing calorie intake). [[Loss aversion]] may be explained as being rational when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may have meant death and it thus may have been rational to place a greater value on losses than on gains.<ref name=\"AEP\"/>\n\nPeople are sometimes more cooperative and altruistic than predicted by economic theory which may be explained by mechanisms such as [[reciprocal altruism]] and [[group selection]] for cooperative behavior. An evolutionary approach may also explain differences between groups such as males being less risk-averse than females since males have more variable [[reproductive success]] than females. While unsuccessful risk-seeking may limit reproductive success for both sexes, males may potentially increase their reproductive success much more than females from successful risk-seeking. [[Frequency-dependent selection]] may explain why people differ in characteristics such as cooperative behavior with cheating becoming an increasingly less successful strategy as the numbers of cheaters increase.<ref name=\"AEP\"/>\n\nAnother argument is that humans have a poor intuitive grasp of the economics of the current environment which is very different from the ancestral environment. The ancestral environment likely had relatively little [[trade]], [[division of labor]], and [[capital good]]s. Technological change was very slow, wealth differences were much smaller, and possession of many available resources were likely [[zero-sum]] games where large inequalities were caused by various forms of exploitation. Humans therefore may have poor intuitive understanding the benefits of [[free trade]] (causing calls for [[protectionism]]), the value of capital goods (making the [[labor theory of value]] appealing), and may intuitively undervalue the benefits of technological development.<ref name=\"AEP\"/>\n\nThere may be a tendency to see the number of available jobs as a zero-sum game with the total number of jobs being fixed which causes people to not realize that [[minimum wage]] laws reduce the number of jobs or to believe that an increased number of jobs in other nations necessarily decreases the number of jobs in their own nation. Large [[income inequality]] may easily be viewed as due to exploitation rather than as due to individual differences in [[productivity]]. This may easily cause poor economic policies, especially since individual voters have few incentives to make the effort of studying societal economics instead of relying on their intuitions since an individual's vote counts for so little and since politicians may be reluctant to take a stand against intuitive views that are incorrect but widely held.<ref name=AEP/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Business and economics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}} \n* [[Behavioral economics]]\n* [[Complexity economics]]\n* [[Creative destruction]]\n* [[Cultural economics]]\n* [[EAEPE]]\n* [[Ecological model of competition]]\n* [[Scientific socialism|Evolutionary socialism]]\n* [[Hypergamy]]\n* [[Institutional economics]]\n* [[Population dynamics]]\n* [[Innovation system]]\n* [[Non-equilibrium economics]]\n* [[Universal Darwinism]]\n* [[Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review]]\n* [[Giovanni Dosi]]\n* [[Robert H.

According to a rabbinic tradition, the names of the twelve tribes were engraved upon the stones with what is called in Hebrew: \u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05e8 = ''shamir'', which, according to [[Rashi]], was a small, rare creature which could cut through the toughest surfaces,<ref>''Sifrey \u1e6drey \u02bba\u1e61ar mefurashim'', ed.

Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' 36:54 (36:51).</ref>\n\nThere are different views in [[classical rabbinical literature]] as to the order of the names; the [[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan|Jerusalem Targum]], for example, argued that the names appeared in the order according to which they were born. [[Maimonides]] describes the jewel stones arranged in four rows, saying that on the first stone belonging to Reuben were also engraved the names of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, while on the last stone belonging to Benjamin were also engraved the words \"the tribes of God\";<ref>Mishne Torah (Code of Jewish Law), ''Hil. Kelei Ha-Mikdash'', 9:7.</ref> [[kabbalistic]] writers such as [[Hezekiah ben Manoah]] and [[Bahya ben Asher]] argued that only six letters from each name were present on each stone, together with a few letters from the names of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], or [[Jacob]], or from the phrase \"[these are] the tribes of Jeshurun\", so that there were 72 letters in total (72 being a very significant number in Kabbalistic thought).<ref name=\"Jewish\"/>\n\nThere was also a different order for the names inscribed on the two \"onyx\"  stones, carried on the High Priest's shoulders. One opinion suggests that the names of the twelve tribes were arranged in groups after their mothers: Leah's six sons aligned one after the other on one stone, with Judah heading this list, followed by Rachel's sons with the names of the concubines' sons interposed between the two sons of Rachel.<ref>Babylonian Talmud, ''Sotah'' 36a\u2013b.</ref> \n\nUnfortunately, the meanings of the Hebrew names for the minerals, given by the [[masoretic text]], are not clear,<ref name=\"Jewish\"/> and though the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] names for them in the [[Septuagint]] are more clear, some scholars believe that they cannot be completely relied on for this matter because the breastplate had gone out of use by the time the Septuagint was created, and several Greek names for various gems have changed meaning between the classical era and modern times.<ref name=\"Jewish\"/> However, although classical rabbinical literature argues that the names were inscribed using a [[Shamir worm]] because neither chisels nor paint nor ink were allowed to mark them out,<ref>Babylonian Talmud, ''Gittin'' 68a</ref><ref>Babylonian Talmud, ''Sotah'' 48b</ref> a more [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] approach suggests that the jewels must have had comparatively [[Hardness (materials science)|low hardness]] in order to be engraved upon, and therefore this gives an additional clue to the identity of the minerals.<ref name=\"Biblica\"/> Others suggest that they were engraved with emery, having the similar property of a diamond used in cutting other stones and which was called in Greek \u03c3\u03bc\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 (''smeris'').\n\nExplanation of the symbolic meaning of the jewels generated a great deal of both Jewish and Christian writing, and was a staple component of the tradition of [[lapidary (text)|lapidaries]] or books on [[gemology]].\n\nThe jewel stones are as follows (the first item in each row is probably the right hand side, as Hebrew is a [[right to left]] script):\n\n=== First row ===\n{{Kehuna and Kohanim}}\n*''Odem'' ({{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b9\u05d3\u05b6\u05dd}}, in the masoretic text) / ''Sardios'' (in the Septuagint) \u2013 both names mean ''red'' (''Odem'' is [[cognate]] with ''[[Adam and Eve|Adam]]''), and probably refers to [[sard]], a very common stone in classical cultures.<ref name=\"Biblica\"/> All authors agree that this stone was of a red colour.<ref>cf. Bar-Bahalul, 1886, vol. ii, p. 1313</ref> With due respect to the Septuagint, ''Odem'' might also refer to [[carnelian]], which was flesh-coloured, or to [[jasper]], which was usually a deep blood-red, was valued as a charm against bleeding, and was common in the surrounding nations of [[Egypt]], [[Babylonia]], and [[Assyria]].<ref name=\"Jewish\"/> The [[Chinese Union Version]] refers to this stone as being a [[ruby]].\n*''Pit'dah'' (<big>\u05e4\u05b4\u05bc\u05d8\u05b0\u05d3\u05b8\u05d4</big> in the masoretic text) / ''Topazios'' (in the Septuagint) \u2013 despite the suggestion of the Septuagint that it was [[topaz]], topaz was scarcely known at the time the Book of Exodus was written (according to both the traditional dating of the book and that by [[textual criticism|critical scholars]]);<ref name=\"Biblica\"/> in the classical era, ''topazios'' referred to Topazos Island, on which a particular yellow mineral was mined (''topazios'' means ''to seek'', in reference to the difficulty in finding the island).<ref name=\"Jewish\"/> Others suggest that topaz was merely [[peridot]], a light green semi-precious stone, and which stone in the ancient world was found primarily on Topazos Island as well as on St. John's Island ([[Zabargad Island|Zabargad]]) in the Egyptian Red Sea. The word ''pit'dah'' is thought by scholars to be connected with the [[Assyria]]n word ''hipindu'', which refers to something that ''flashed'' (presumably meaning ''shimmered''), and thus the jewel in question would fit the description of [[Olivine|chrysolite]], a [[translucent]] greenish yellow mineral, common throughout the [[Levant]],<ref name=\"Jewish\"/> and particularly found on a particular Zabargad in the [[Red Sea]], under the control of the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]].<ref name=\"Biblica\"/>\n*''Bare\u1e33et'' (<big>\u05d1\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e7\u05b6\u05ea</big> = in the masoretic text) / ''Smaragdos'' (in the [[Septuagint]]) \u2013 ''Bareketh'' etymologically means 'lightning flash', whence shimmering or shiny. ''Smaragdos'' is [[cognate]] with ''[[emerald]]'', but is somewhat of a [[false friend]] as the Greek term could apply to a number of different green gems, not just the emerald in particular. ''Smaragdos'' was often used in Greek literature to refer to an intensely bright crystal found in columnar formations.<ref name=\"Jewish\"/> Emerald in the stricter modern sense of green [[beryl]] exists locally in Egypt. Items carved from emerald are known from as early as the [[12th Dynasty]], 1900s&nbsp;BCE, during the Bronze Age. But these emeralds are random finds, and not actively mined until the [[Ptolemies|Ptolemaic period]]. [[Cleopatra]], the last of the Ptolemies, is famous for her love for the Egyptian emerald. Other minerals resembling emerald are [[heliodor]] (taking into account the implication of ''Smaragdos'' that it was green) and [[rock crystal]] (ignoring the literal meaning of ''Smaragdos'', since the masoretic text does not appear to specify colour);<ref name=\"Biblica\"/> there is much to be said for ''Smaragdos'' being either of those.<ref name=\"Biblica\"/> Although \"emerald\" is the most common form used to describe the Hebrew word, ''bare\u1e33et'', in other sources (e.g. the [[Septuagint]] on Ezekiel 28:13), the word ''bare\u1e33et'' is rendered as \"onyx\". [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquilas the proselyte]] ([[Onkelos]]), in his Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch, writes \u05d1\u05b8\u05e8\u05e7\u05b8\u05df = ''bar\u1e33an'', for this word. According to the [[Midrash Rabba]] <small>(Numbers Rabba 2:7)</small>, the stone called ''bare\u1e33et'' had veins or parallel bands of colours white, black and red running through it, suggesting that it may have actually been a kind of agate or onyx. This may explain why in some French translations the word is rendered as \"agate\". In the South Arabian dialect spoken in Yemen during the Middle Ages, ''ba\u1e33arani'' (believed to be a corruption of ''bar\u1e33an'') was an exceptionally beautiful and rare onyx stone mined on Mount Anis, in Yemen, one variety of which having a red surface with a vein of white over another of black running through it.{{#tag:ref|Pliny also mentions several varieties of onyx stone in his ''Natural History'' 37:90, and one stone, in particular, meets the description of the stone described here by Israel\u2019s sages.<ref>{{harvp|Faris|1938|pp=26\u201327}}, s.v.

''Nofekh'' appears to be a [[loan word]]; it may derive from the Egyptian term ''m-f-k-t'', referring to [[malachite]] or [[turquoise]], both of which are a greenish blue;<ref name=\"Biblica\"/> it may instead derive from ''lupakku'', a term appearing in the [[Amarna letters]], referring to a mineral of unknown colour which was sent in tribute to [[Akhnaten]] from [[Ashkalon]]. In classical rabbinical literature there is some debate between whether ''Nofekh'' was red or greenish blue; [[Exodus Rabbah]] and the second [[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan|Jerusalem Targum]] favour it being red, while the [[Targum Onkelos|Babylonian Targum]] and first Jerusalem Targum favour it being green.<ref name=\"Jewish\"/>\n*''Sapir'' (<big>\u05e1\u05b7\u05e4\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05e8</big> = in the masoretic text) / ''Sapphiros'' (in the Septuagint) \u2013 despite appearing to refer to [[sapphire]], sapphire was essentially unknown before the era of the [[Roman Empire]] and its use in Greek texts is believed to be a mere transliteration of the Hebrew. Once it became more known, it was treated as merely being a form of [[Zircon|hyacinth]] or of [[jacinth]].<ref name=\"Jewish\"/> It is more likely that the term ''Sapir'' referred to a mineral of similar colour to sapphires, and that the name gradually came to refer to the latter mineral, on account of its colour; scholars think the most likely candidate is [[lapis lazuli]], a stone with a deep, ocean-blue colour which was frequently sent as a gift to [[Akhenaten]] from Babylon.<ref name=\"Jewish\"/><ref name=\"Biblica\"/> [[Theophrastus]] mentions the stone ''sapphirus'' as being \"dark\" and having the \"colour of [[verdigris]]\", as well as being \"speckled as of with gold\".<ref>{{harvp|Eichholz|1965|pp=65, 71}}</ref> By all accounts, his description fits the [[lapis-lazuli]].\n*''Yahalom'' (<big>\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05dd</big> = in the masoretic text) / ''Iaspis'' \u1f34\u03b1\u03c3\u03c0\u03b9\u03c2 (in the Septuagint) \u2013 in some other places the Septuagint instead has ''Beryllios'' where the masoretic reads ''Yahalom''.<ref name=\"Biblica\"/> The word ''Yahalom'' appears to be connected with the Hebrew meaning ''strike hard'', and possibly with the word ''hallamish'' meaning [[flint]];<ref name=\"Biblica\"/> ''hallamish'' is connected to the Assyrian word ''elmeshu'', referring to a precious stone which was hard, and possibly white, or at least with an insignificant colour, and from which whole [[Ring (finger)|rings]] were sometimes made.<ref name=\"Biblica\"/> A few scholars have suggested that ''Yahalom'' may refer to diamonds, owing to their hardness, though the skill of cutting diamonds had not been discovered before the classical era.<ref name=\"Jewish\"/> Although the Septuagint's ''Onychion'' is the Greek term for [[onyx]], onyx was not mined prior to the era of classical Greece. \"Onyx\" is derived from the Greek for fingernail, due to the pink-white veining.{{#tag:ref|The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', [[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's New International Dictionary]]'' (Second Edition), and ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (College Edition) state that \"onyx\" derives from the Greek term, \"onux\", meaning \"(finger-)nail\", \"claw\" or onyx-stone. The connection between \"nail\" or \"claw\" and the stone is that the onyx stone is usually found with a vein of white on pink background like the linula of a fingernail. There is no indication in these or other desk dictionaries that the word \"onyx\" could be derived from a word meaning \"ring\".|group=Note}} In the Syriac [[Peshitta]] of the sixth or seventh century (MS. B.21, Inferiore of the Ambrosian Library in Milan, Italy), the word used to describe this stone is \u0722\u0729\u0725\u072c\u0710 = ''naq'atha'',<ref>''The Old Testament in Syriac (According to the Peshitta Version)'', Part I, Leiden E. J. Brill 1977, p. 183.</ref> a word which is sometimes transliterated into Arabic as it is pronounced in Aramaic, mainly by Arabic-speaking Christians. Bar-Ali, a 9th-century Arab author, brings down two opinions about this stone, the ''naq'atha'', saying, by one opinion, that it is \"honey-coloured\", and by the other opinion that it is \"turquoise, a blue-coloured stone\".<ref>{{harvp|Gottheil|1908|p=95}}</ref> In some versions of the Peshitta, the Aramaic word rendered for the same stone is ''shabzez'', translated as \"diamond\". This may account for today's understanding of this word, although in ancient times ''yahalom'' may have meant something else. Of the well-known honey-coloured gemstones, we find Citrene and Hessonite garnet (both, from Sri Lanka), while in Africa (Tanzania) we find Imperial Zircon, a honey-coloured stone with an extreme brilliance.

[[Aquila of Sinope|Aquilas the proselyte]] ([[Onkelos]]), in his Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch, writes \u05d1\u05b8\u05e8\u05e7\u05b8\u05df = ''bar\u1e33an'', for this word. According to the [[Midrash Rabba]] <small>(Numbers Rabba 2:7)</small>, the stone called ''bare\u1e33et'' had veins or parallel bands of colours white, black and red running through it, suggesting that it may have actually been a kind of agate or onyx. This may explain why in some French translations the word is rendered as \"agate\". In the South Arabian dialect spoken in Yemen during the Middle Ages, ''ba\u1e33arani'' (believed to be a corruption of ''bar\u1e33an'') was an exceptionally beautiful and rare onyx stone mined on Mount Anis, in Yemen, one variety of which having a red surface with a vein of white over another of black running through it.{{#tag:ref|Pliny also mentions several varieties of onyx stone in his ''Natural History'' 37:90, and one stone, in particular, meets the description of the stone described here by Israel\u2019s sages.<ref>{{harvp|Faris|1938|pp=26\u201327}}, s.v.

[[Josephus]], quoting from one version of the Septuagint, says that it was a beryl.<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'', iii.vii \u00a7 5</ref> The [[Midrash Rabba]] (Numbers Rabba 2:7) says that the stone was varicolored, meaning, all of the colours combined were to be found in the ''ya\u0161feh''.\n\n=== 12 jewels in the New Testament ===\nIn the New Testament [[Book of Revelation]] is the description of a ''city wall'', with each layer of stones in the wall being from a different material; in the original [[Koine Greek]], the layers are given as ''iaspis'', ''sapphiros'', ''chalcedon'', ''smaragdos'', ''sardonyx'', ''sardion'', ''chrysolithos'', ''beryllos'', ''topazion'', ''chrysoprason'', ''yacinthos'', ''amethystos''.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Revelation|21:19\u201320|}} ([[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-Aland edition]])</ref> This list appears to be based on the Septuagint's version of the list of jewels in the Breastplate \u2013 if the top half of the breastplate was rotated by 180 degrees, and the bottom half turned upside down, with ''Onchion'' additionally swapping places with ''Topazion'', the lists become extremely similar; there are only four differences:\n* ''Onchion'' (literally ''onyx'') has become [[sardonyx]] (red onyx)\n* ''Anthrax'' has become ''chalcedon'' (literally meaning ''[[chalcedony]]'', of which [[carnelian|the red variety]] is the most common). ''Anthrax'' literally means ''coal'', presumably meaning the red colour of burning coal.\n* ''Ligurios'' has become ''chrysoprason''. Scholars suspect that ''ligurios'' was a pale yellowish mineral, and although ''[[chrysoprase]]'' now refers to a specific gemstone which is generally apple-green in colour, in earlier times it referred to gems of a yellowish [[Spring bud|leek-green]], such as [[peridot]]; ''chrysoprase'' literally means ''golden leek''.<ref name=\"Biblica\"/>\n* ''Achates'' (''agate'') has been replaced by ''yacinthos'' (''jacinth''). According to classical rabbinical literature, the specific agate was of a sky-blue colour, and though ''[[jacinth]]'' now refers to a red-tinted clear gem, this was not the case at the time the Book of Revelation was written, and at that time ''jacinth'' appears to have referred to a bluish gem; Pliny describes ''jacinth'' as a dull and blueish amethyst, while [[Solinus]] describes it as a clear blue tinted gem \u2013 the modern sapphire.<ref name=\"Biblica\"/>\n\n===Pattern===\nWhether there is any pattern to the choice of gemstones depends on their identity. Taking the majority view of scholars in regard to the identity of the gems, and including the implication from the Book of Revelation that the ''onyx'' at the end of the fourth row was a ''sardonyx'', there are four colours \u2013 red, green, yellow, and blue \u2013 each represented by a clear gem (red \u2013 carbuncle, green \u2013 heliodor, yellow \u2013 chrysolite, blue \u2013 amethyst), an opaque gem (red \u2013 carnelian/red jasper, green \u2013 green jasper, yellow \u2013 yellow jasper/yellow serpentine, blue \u2013 lapis lazuli), and a striped gem (red \u2013 sardonyx, green \u2013 malachite, yellow \u2013 pale golden agate, blue \u2013 sky-blue agate).<ref name=\"Biblica\"/> The four colours of red, green, yellow, and blue, are the first four colours (apart from black and white) distinguished by languages, and are distinguished in all cultures with at least six colour distinctions (the other two being black and white).<ref name=\"Berlin\">{{harvp|Berlin|Kay|1969}}</ref> These colours roughly correspond to the sensitivities of the [[Ganglion cell layer|retinal ganglion]] cells.

As of 2017, nearly 25% of the population of the five metropolitan capitals (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide) were listening to DAB+ radio each week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://communications.gov.au/publications/digital-radio-report|title=Australian Government report on Digital Radio|access-date=1 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302090019/https://www.communications.gov.au/publications/digital-radio-report|archive-date=2 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Over 3 million digital radios have been sold with listeners being able to receive over 380 DAB+ devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/australia|title=WorldDAB Country Report - Australia}}</ref>\n\n==Austria==\nDigital Radio Austria (Verein Digitalradio \u00d6sterreich) will apply for a DAB+ trial license. Two transmitters will operate as a single frequency network, with one transmitting a 10&nbsp;kW signal. This test mode is scheduled to last a year, with the possibility of an extension in to 2015. The twelve radio stations which will take part in the trial are being selected. Unlike earlier trials, consumers will receive more information on this new way of radio consumption and there will be a large volume of digital radios available in consumer electronic shops.\n\nAustria is committed to a digital radio future and a report by the regulators, the Austrian Communications Authority (KommAustria) and RTR-GmbH recommended DAB+ in Band III as the way forward. As planned, KommAustria completed a call for interest regarding DAB+ in August 2012. KommAustria intended to launch DAB+ by an open call for tender regarding the DAB+ network if enough parties showed believable and sustainable interest. A minimum limit of 12 possible programs (to fill one MUX coverage) was set. Unfortunately this limit was not reached as too few parties showed interest or failed to meet the criteria of the call for interest. Most remarkably, the public broadcaster ORF and the bigger players in the Austrian market did not show interest but strongly voiced their opposition against the launch of DAB+ in Austria. However, there is a group of broadcasters who are very outspoken in favour of DAB+, but the majority of radio stations remain unsure. The public broadcaster ORF has renewed its objection to any DAB+ plans. In the upcoming \"Digitalisation Concept\" which marks the authority's official strategy and schedule for the digitalisation of broadcasting, KommAustria plans to elaborate on the technical details of a possible DAB+ network. There will be no further calls for interest but the possibility for a call for tender upon request. Nevertheless, a working group that was created in 2009 to consider the countries digital future is still at work. Its members are stakeholders from the Austrian radio market who represent opponents and proponents of digital radio. It consists of the regulatory authority, the public broadcaster ORF, the commercial and non-commercial broadcasters associations, the electronic industry and consumer associations. The group is constantly watching and evaluating the progress of digital radio in other European countries. The success of digital radio in Germany will affect whether Austria decides to implement DAB+.\n\nThe Austrian Association of the Electrical and Electronic Industry (FEEI), and Austrian radio stations such as Radio Arabella and LoungeFM have founded the digital radio club, Digital Radio Austria. The aim of the new organisation is the promotion and development of digital radio in Austria, developing the media category \"Radio\" in the digital media world, the establishment of radio on new platforms and to promote the provision of information and support for education and training in the field of electronic and new media.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/austria|title=Austria &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Belgium==\n===French (Wallonia and Brussels)===\n\nThe [[Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Belge de la Communaut\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise]] (RTBF) is the public broadcaster for the [[French Community of Belgium|Belgian French speaking community]]. Since 1998, RTBF has operated one DAB multiplex simulcasting its five FM radio stations and two [[Belgischer Rundfunk|BRF]] (the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|Belgian German speaking]] public broadcaster) FM radio stations, covering of Brussels and Wallonia. On this multiplex, RTBF is also testing four DAB+ audio and data channels (indifferent bit rates and with slideshows) for itself and also for the private radio stations. The aim is to plan a roadmap for DAB+ in French speaking Belgium together with the private broadcasters, subject to approval from the French Community Government and the regulator, the [[Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019Audiovisuel]] (CSA). In Spring 2011 a common vision of the main broadcasters, both private and public, was defined with a four-tier strategy for migration from analogue to digital radio (DAB+ broadcast; hybrid radio; single online radio player and radio on TV). In summer 2011 the Parliament of the French-speaking Community adopted unanimously a resolution asking the French-speaking Government to support the migration to digital radio from 2011 onwards.\n\nThe CSA (regulator) launched a public consultation about digital radio in autumn 2011 which provided positive feedback. In spring 2012, the CSA recommended to the Government a DAB+ rollout based mainly on two layers in Band III. In June 2012 the Government authorized RTBF to proceed with DAB+ trials for commercial and non-profit radio stations licensed by the CSA.\n\nThe next step is to achieve a public funding agreement to finance the investments needed for the technical DAB+ rollout, upgrade of the RTBF DAB network to DAB+ to ensure deep indoor coverage of Brussels and Wallonia, for a potential public launch in 2015 (to mark the 101st anniversary of the first radio broadcasting in Belgium). RTBF is testing Radio DNS interactive slideshows on its DAB+ channels.\n\n===Flemish (Flanders and Brussels)===\n\nThe [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie]] (VRT) is the public broadcaster for the Belgian Flemish Community. VRT has one DAB multiplex in operation with eight radio stations: the 5 FM-also stations Radio 1, Radio 2, Klara, Studio Brussel and MNM and three digital-only channels: Nieuws+ (news), Klara Continuo (non-stop classic and older music) and MNM Hits (Top 40).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/nl/aanbod/kijk-en-luister/radio-luisteren/dab-|title=DAB+ &#124; VRT.be|website=www.vrt.be}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/nl/heb-je-een-vraag/vragen-over-dab-|title=Vragen over DAB+ &#124; VRT.be|website=www.vrt.be}}</ref> Norkring, which operates VRT's multiplex, also has a license for another multiplex and is wording on a DAB+ roll out.

Based on the results of this call, Norkring has launched a second call to include a progressive deployment, with the Brussels DAB+ roll-out in the first phase.\n\nIn May 2016, the Flemish government announced the intent to have all nationwide Flemish radio stations broadcast exclusively in DAB+ by 2022.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio stations have until 2022 to prepare for DAB+ (in Dutch)|url=http://deredactie.be/permalink/1.2654705|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]]|accessdate=13 May 2016|date=13 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe VRT was to switch from DAB to DAB+ on 17 October 2017 and to discontinue DAB service at the same time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/nl/over-de-vrt/nieuws/2017/10/11/alle-vrt-radiozenders-op-dab--vanaf-17-oktober|title=VRT-radiozenders op DAB+ vanaf 17/10 &#124; VRT.be|website=www.vrt.be|language=nl}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2017/10/11/nieuwe-radio--kies-voor-dab-/|title=Nieuwe radio?

Then the CSA should publish a timetable for a call for applications for tenders for digital terrestrial licenses for France's next 20 biggest cities which will add up to 62% coverage. An additional tender will also allow to add DAB+ services to the 14 multiplexes in Paris, Marseille and Nice, as well as five more multiplexes in these towns.\n\nIn April 2012 the CSA re-launched a call of tender for three cities (Paris for seven multiplexes, Marseille and Nice for six multiplexes each). The four main commercial radio groups decided do not bid and the government did not allow the public service (Radio France) to pre-empt frequencies. At the beginning of October 2012 the CSA published the candidates selected for the three cities. At the beginning of 2014, six multiplexes will be on air in Paris, four in Marseille and four in Nice.\n\nRoll out of terrestrial digital radio was scheduled to start in December 2009 but was postponed amid opposition from several sources, including private radio operators. The Prime Minister commissioned a further report by David Kessler, former chief executive France Culture, which was published in mid-2011 and suggested that the conditions had not been met for the full scale deployment of digital radio in France. The report suggested a moratorium of two to three years during which time the French market would look at\nthe deployment of digital radio in the rest of Europe. The report also stated that the government approved the CSA's decision to allow further trials to continue.\n\nThe CSA is responsible for taking the findings of the Kessler report forward and in order to do this set up an \u2018Observatory\u2019 which includes all of the industry players. The publication of the Kessler report meant the market could move forward after a period of stagnation and to this end various trials were put on-air (Paris, Nantes, Marseille and Lyon).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/france|title=France &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220000457/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/france|archive-date=20 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Germany==\nBy the end of 2013 more than 120 national, regional and local programs will be broadcast in Germany. Also more than 90% of the German population can listen to at least one digital radio ensemble. This is considered to be a respectable success two years after the launch.\n\nDespite some changes in the national multiplex, the prospect for both commercial and public broadcasters is very positive as receiver sales are increasing. Furthermore, a stable ecosystem of private digital radio stations could be established in metropolitan areas such as Frankfurt, Berlin and Munich.\n\nThe current focus of broadcasters and network operators is to continue their marketing efforts in all media. For this reason the initiative \u2018Digitalradio Deutschland\u2019 was founded by the commercial broadcasters on the national multiplex (represented by DRD GmbH), the ARD group, Deutschlandradio and the network operator Media Broadcast. The goal is to coordinate the b2b and b2c marketing initiatives of all stakeholders to foster the evolution of digital radio in Germany by obtaining a reasonable market penetration by end of 2014.\n\nCoordination with the device industry is carried out via the initiative \u2018Digitalradio Deutschland\u2019, organised by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi). Five working groups were created to guide all areas of digital radio development and roll out, such as receiver/devices, data and traffic services, networks or advertisements.\n\nThe initiative hired consumer electronics market professionals which significantly improved the communication with the retailers. Many stores are now equipped with in-house-coverage solutions. The German car manufacturers offer DAB+ receivers for nearly all models either as an option or line fit. Two commercial telematics service providers use data capacity on the national mux to transmit TPEG based traffic information via DAB. The impressive coverage of Germany's highways over the last two years was secured through market collaboration and support for the technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/germany|title=Germany &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724032907/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/germany|archive-date=24 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Ghana==\nOn 14 May 2008 FonTV, Africa's first mobile phone enabled television content service, was launched via DMB.

The conditions for the transition were:\n\n# Coverage (absolute condition for FM shutdown): Before 2015, the public broadcaster NRK must achieve coverage of 99.5%, the commercial broadcasters on the national network #1 are required to reach 90% of the population\n#Value added for the listeners (absolute condition for FM shutdown). There must be a value added for the listeners in going from FM to DAB, both in terms of available content and in terms of user experience.\n#Digital listening (condition to be met in order to shut down FM in 2017. Failure to reach it can postpone the shutdown until 2019). Before 2015 50% of the radio listeners must daily use a digital radio platform (currently this is 45%). This does not specify market share of listening, contrary to the UK requirement, only reach. \"Digital platform\" also includes listening via internet and via the digital TV network. This condition is set in order to measure the listeners' independence of the analogue FM-platform.\n#In-car solution (condition to be met in order to shut down FM in 2017.

In April 2012, Rediffusion Singapore announced its service was under receivership and went off-air from 1 May 2012. Its branding and assets were brought over by Eduplus Holdings in June 2012.\n\nThere are no plans to turn on the DAB network in Singapore. Services are running via FM and online streaming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/singapore|title=Singapore &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Slovenia==\nRegular DAB+ transmission in Slovenia began on 19.

About half a million people, or 22.5% of the population, were potentially able to receive DAB transmissions.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In January it was announced<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtvslo.si/sporocila-za-javnost/rtv-slovenija-pridobila-frekvenco-za-dab-omrezje/384303|title=RTV Slovenija pridobila frekvenco za DAB omre\u017eje|website=RTVSLO.si}}</ref> that they have obtained a frequency allocation for a national network of DAB+ transmitters, covering 73% of Slovene households and 89% of highways and expressways. Test broadcasting on said frequency began on 2. September 2016 from Krvavec transmitter, shortly after that RTV Slovenia began nationwide regular transmission on 19. September 2016.\n\n==South Africa==\nThe Joint SADIBA/NAB Digital Radio DAB+ Trial Working group's application for a high\u2013powered DAB+ trial licence has been approved. The trial licence was granted to the South African Broadcasting Corporation (the applicant on behalf of the NAB radio members) by the regulator, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA). The trial will run from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015, and Sentech will be the signal distributor for the duration of the trial.\n\nThe SADIBA/NAB Working group is encouraged by the commitment of all stakeholders in putting digital radio firmly on the South African broadcasting agenda.\n\nThe South African DAB+ trial will consist of two high power transmitting stations (10&nbsp;kW transmitter power) 100&nbsp;kW ERP situated in Johannesburg and Pretoria in the province of Gauteng. The trial will operate as a SFN in VHF band III on Channel 13F on a frequency of 239.200&nbsp;MHz. This will happen after coverage verification at transmitter powers of 2&nbsp;kW, 5&nbsp;kW, and 10&nbsp;kW. The total area covered by the trial is 21185km2 and the total gross population covered is 10 705 387 (21.5% of total SA population). It is envisaged that between 18 and 20 radio from the Public, Commercial and Community sectors will participate in the trial. The trial will allow the testing of:\nEnd-to-end technical functionality\nExtent of portable mobile coverage\nSignal permeability\nDemonstrate digital radio services and value-added services\nPerformance in the field using typical consumer equipment and professional test and measurement equipment.\nThe effects of vehicle penetration loss, building penetration loss and clutter (e.g. buildings and vegetation) on coverage.\nTesting of the various encoding methods (stereo, para stereo, mono) for different audio types and at different bit rates to get a good understanding of what bit rates/encoding to use for the different program types.\nInvestigate the delivery of PAD within these tests, synchronisation with the audio and rate of change of the images.  \nIn July 2013 over 200 radio industry representatives came together at the South African Broadcasting Corporation's (SABC) facility in Johannesburg to attend a landmark workshop on the rollout of DAB+ digital radio and to discuss plans for a high-powered DAB+ trial transmission extending from Pretoria to Johannesburg by end 2013. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), indicated that it stands ready to support broadcasting innovation in South Africa, which will be the first country to exploit opportunities for delivery of educational services via DAB+, as well as services for those with disabilities. Broadcasting radio via DAB+ will also allow ICASA to license new entrants where FM bandwidth is congested.\n\nMobileTV PTY performed technical tests of DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadcasting) and DAB+ in Gauteng from August 2011 until the end of July 2013 and plans to expand trials in South Africa. The prospective broadcaster will launch trials of DMB technology in the Free State and the Western Cape before the end of the 2013. In July 2012 they applied for a commercial license and expect to get an answer during 2013. ICASA has granted test licences for Cape and Bloemfontein, while assessing new applications for Port Eliazbeth, East London and Mpumalanga. MobileTV PTY aims to switch on the trials in Cape Town and Bloemfontein on 1 October and 1 November respectively. Their two transmitters will be relocated from Pretoria and Johannesburg Autumn 2013.\n\nMobileTV PTY ran two TV channels and one radio station on a test license. If a license is granted they would then cover 15-20 million of the 45 million people in South Africa and expand coverage in parallel to sales of devices and uptake of services. MobileTV PTY has teamed up with SABC, the public service broadcaster in South Africa. SABC reaches 76% of the population daily and is by far the biggest broadcaster and is partially financed by a TV license and partially by advertisements. MobileTV PTY is in dialogue with the Department of Education to evaluate whether the technology can be used for educational purposes, such as to reach rural schools and colleges in a cost-effective manner. The Department is primarily interested in the abilities of data transfer but an educational TV channel has not been ruled out. SABC will offer their 18 radio channels. MobileTV PTY wishes to also offer distribution for private radio stations following the launch.\n\nNo programmes are on air. Mobile TV PTY is awaiting a commercial license from the government. If licences are granted they will within the first year cover up to 50% of the population of South Africa, although they aim to increase this to between 80 and 90% within 2\u20133 years. Their plan is to broadcast 6-10 mobile TV channels and two radio stations. Additional services that combine broadcasting and the internet on the same device will be an essential part of their business model. Such services include traffic information, gambling, integration with social media and touch-screen shopping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-africa|title=South Africa &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==South Korea==\nAs the first country to commercially launch mobile TV, South Korea is the most successful DMB market in the world. More than 62 million DMB enabled devices have been sold, of which the most popular are mobile phones. This number is expected to rise even more with an increase in coverage; services already cover over 80% of the country. Hundreds of DMB devices are available in this market and usage of mobile TV increases year on year. Interactive services are also growing in popularity adding value to broadcasting services.\n\nThe Korean government has set up a digital audio project to recommend a digital audio broadcasting standard for Korea.  Following ETRI's investigation of various digital radio platforms, a major decision is expected regarding the adoption of a digital radio technology for South Korean broadcasters.\n\nKorea's latest innovation is an interactive mobile TV service, or Smart DMB, launched in May 2011 with six terrestrial-DMB operators (T-DMB). With Smart DMB, mobile TV viewers are able to search the internet, receive EPG information updates, and even enjoy \u2018TV Screen Capture and Share Service\u2019 through SNS while watching television. Moreover, hybrid DMB was launched in Aug 2013 for the high quality video service.\n\nA DAB+ trial has been on air in Seoul since December 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-korea|title=South Korea &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710122752/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-korea|archive-date=10 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Spain==\nA total of 18 DAB audio services are on air. Population coverage is currently 20%. The Spanish DAB Association ([http://www.radiodigitaldab.com/index.htm Asociaci\u00f3n Foro de la Radio Digital]) comprising both national private and public broadcasters, is responsible for DAB/DAB+ in Spain.\n\nSpain first began broadcasting terrestrial digital radio in April 1998 covering Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. From 2002 to June 2011, 23 transmitters covered the 52% of the Spanish population through three national multiplexes (1 SFN and 2 MFN). In addition, in some Comunidades Aut\u00f3nomas, DAB services were launched on additional regional multiplexes, but  they are currently switched off.\n\nThe Council of Ministers reached an agreement on Digital Radio in June 2011 and approved a Digitalisation Plan for Terrestrial Broadcasting with the following measures:\n\n#Reduction of DAB coverage from 52% to 20%, in order to facilitate a migration to DAB+\n#Flexibility for the broadcasters, in order to allow for  migration to DAB+\n#Study of a possible reassignment of the multiplexes\n#Promotional activities through the Spanish DAB Forum\n#DAB+ trials\n#A study of the necessary conditions to determine the date of  a possible analogue switch off<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/spain|title=Spain &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Sweden==\nDAB transmissions in Sweden started on 27 September 1995 and today the coverage (MUX1) is 35% of the population with services from public service broadcaster Swedish Radio (SR). The license under which SR operates is valid until 31 December 2019.\n\nDuring the years several propositions have been put forward to the Parliament suggesting a larger digital radio network roll-out for public service broadcaster SR. This is seen as the first step to a switchover from analogue FM to digital DAB/DAB+.\n\nIn 2009, trial transmissions of DAB+ started and the coverage (MUX 2) quickly reached 22% of the population with 16 services from public service radio, commercial radio and community local radio.\n\nIn 2010, the Radio and TV Act came into effect which, for the first time, allowed commercial radio companies to apply for digital licenses. This paved the way for a radio industry united behind DAB+, something for which both public and commercial services have been lobbying for. At the same time, the Swedish Government allocated spectrum for a total of four nationwide multiplexers in VHF band III to digital radio DAB/DAB+. Two multiplexers are reserved for SR and two multiplexers are reserved for commercial radio. Three of the multiplexers are regionally MFNs and one multiplexer is a nationwide SFN on channel 12B.\n\nIn 2012, the license regulator (MRTV) started the license process for commercial digital radio. All major commercial broadcasters, representing 91% of all listening not counting SR, applied for a total of 22 audio programme licenses spread over 2 commercial multiplexers.\n\nIn 2013, the Government appointed a Digital radio Industry Coordinator to put forward a Digital Switchover (DSO) plan at the latest in November 2014 after consultation with SR and the commercial radio broadcasters. The purpose of this plan is to put forward a proposition on DSO for a decision by the Swedish Parliament.\n \t\nIn 2014 the radio industry saw the commercial licenses issued. However the Switchover Plan put forward by the Digital Radio Industry Coordinator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/sweden|title=Sweden &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref> was rejected  by the government June 2015 after a negative consultation round which included the telecom authority (PTS). The government also received serious objections by the National Audit Office. The rejection of the DSO plan was finally confirmed by a unanimous vote in the Parliament February 3, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/skrivelse/2015/10/skr.-20151625/|title=Riksrevisionens rapport om digitalradio|first=Regeringen och|last=Regeringskansliet|date=14 October 2015|website=Regeringskansliet}}</ref><ref>Riksrevisionens rapport om digitalradio, (RiR 2015:5)</ref>\n\n==Switzerland==\nThe Federal Office of Communications awarded a radio licence to the Digris AG company for the operation of DAB+ islands throughout Switzerland.\n\nToday there is one national (with four regional multiplexes for the four different languages) two regional and one local multiplexes, covering the German, French and Italian speaking areas of the country, with a mix of public and commercial services. In the middle of October 2012 the standard DAB was switched to the standard DAB+. Two to three programs per region will remain on simulcast service DAB/DAB+ until 2015.\n\nThe original four multiplexes are run by the public broadcaster SRG SSR, the first commercial DAB+ multiplex which was launched on 13 October 2009 now broadcasts 14 commercial radio stations in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. A second local commercial DAB+ multiplex started in December 2012 in the German-speaking part with six commercial radio- and three public radio stations and a first regional commercial DAB+ multiplex in the French-speaking part will start at the end of 2013.\n\nSwitzerland first launched DAB digital radio services in 1999 when the public broadcaster, SRG SSR went on air.

In July 2010, the Government of the [[Republic of China]] announced plans for digital convergence by 2015. During the first stage of the program, from 2010 through 2012, a number of bills being formulated and sent to the legislature for review, including a radio and TV broadcast law. Taiwan has been a supporter of DAB and DAB+ broadcasting and planned for a full implementation of digital broadcasting (both TV and radio) by 2010. Lack of marketing, promotion and consumer awareness has slowed this digital expansion. The new laws being developed should set a firm timeline in place for digital conversion of all media and telecoms. DAB in Taiwan is solely operated by SuperFM on a trial basis. There are seven trial services available including one DMB.\n\nSuperFM broadcasts multiple foreign language programmes, for example in Vietnamese, Thai and Filipino aimed at foreign nationals living in Taiwan but who are unable to listen to their home nation's radio programmes via analogue radio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/chinese-taipei|title=Chinese Taipei &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Thailand==\nFollowing the successful licence auction for commercial digital TV channels in December 2013, the [[National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission]] (NBTC) is looking to auction about 4,000 similar licences for digital radio in early 2015.\n\nThe licences would be in the nationwide and region-wide categories. There are expected to about 20 nationwide licences. The auction will be held on a phase-by-phase basis.\n\nThe NBTC's broadcasting committee will sign a memorandum of understanding with MCOT, the Public Relations Department and the Royal Thai Army at the end of January 2014 to conduct a year-long trial of digital radio broadcasting.\n\nThe digital radio service will be provided on VHF (very high frequency) bands that will be returned to the NBTC by the state agencies that own existing analog TV concessions.\n\nThe existing analog AM and FM radio frequencies will be allocated for community and public radio. There are 525 AM and FM channels nationwide.\n\nThe estimated final price of a commercial digital radio licence would be around Bt100,000. About 10 licences to provide network services to the prospective digital radio operators will also be granted.\n\nThe first Thailand Broadcasting Master Plan (2012-2016) states strategies for digital terrestrial radio roll-out, roadmap and policy for digital terrestrial radio roll-out within two years, after the adoption of the Master Plan.\nDAB+ demonstrations started in Bangkok on 1 March 2013. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), jointly organised the \"NBTC/ITU Workshop on Digital Radio Technologies\" held in Bangkok, Thailand, 1\u20133 March 2013.

Two transmitters will operate as a single frequency network, with one transmitting a 10&nbsp;kW signal. This test mode is scheduled to last a year, with the possibility of an extension in to 2015. The twelve radio stations which will take part in the trial are being selected. Unlike earlier trials, consumers will receive more information on this new way of radio consumption and there will be a large volume of digital radios available in consumer electronic shops.\n\nAustria is committed to a digital radio future and a report by the regulators, the Austrian Communications Authority (KommAustria) and RTR-GmbH recommended DAB+ in Band III as the way forward. As planned, KommAustria completed a call for interest regarding DAB+ in August 2012. KommAustria intended to launch DAB+ by an open call for tender regarding the DAB+ network if enough parties showed believable and sustainable interest. A minimum limit of 12 possible programs (to fill one MUX coverage) was set. Unfortunately this limit was not reached as too few parties showed interest or failed to meet the criteria of the call for interest. Most remarkably, the public broadcaster ORF and the bigger players in the Austrian market did not show interest but strongly voiced their opposition against the launch of DAB+ in Austria. However, there is a group of broadcasters who are very outspoken in favour of DAB+, but the majority of radio stations remain unsure. The public broadcaster ORF has renewed its objection to any DAB+ plans. In the upcoming \"Digitalisation Concept\" which marks the authority's official strategy and schedule for the digitalisation of broadcasting, KommAustria plans to elaborate on the technical details of a possible DAB+ network. There will be no further calls for interest but the possibility for a call for tender upon request. Nevertheless, a working group that was created in 2009 to consider the countries digital future is still at work. Its members are stakeholders from the Austrian radio market who represent opponents and proponents of digital radio. It consists of the regulatory authority, the public broadcaster ORF, the commercial and non-commercial broadcasters associations, the electronic industry and consumer associations. The group is constantly watching and evaluating the progress of digital radio in other European countries. The success of digital radio in Germany will affect whether Austria decides to implement DAB+.\n\nThe Austrian Association of the Electrical and Electronic Industry (FEEI), and Austrian radio stations such as Radio Arabella and LoungeFM have founded the digital radio club, Digital Radio Austria. The aim of the new organisation is the promotion and development of digital radio in Austria, developing the media category \"Radio\" in the digital media world, the establishment of radio on new platforms and to promote the provision of information and support for education and training in the field of electronic and new media.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/austria|title=Austria &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Belgium==\n===French (Wallonia and Brussels)===\n\nThe [[Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Belge de la Communaut\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise]] (RTBF) is the public broadcaster for the [[French Community of Belgium|Belgian French speaking community]]. Since 1998, RTBF has operated one DAB multiplex simulcasting its five FM radio stations and two [[Belgischer Rundfunk|BRF]] (the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|Belgian German speaking]] public broadcaster) FM radio stations, covering of Brussels and Wallonia. On this multiplex, RTBF is also testing four DAB+ audio and data channels (indifferent bit rates and with slideshows) for itself and also for the private radio stations. The aim is to plan a roadmap for DAB+ in French speaking Belgium together with the private broadcasters, subject to approval from the French Community Government and the regulator, the [[Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019Audiovisuel]] (CSA). In Spring 2011 a common vision of the main broadcasters, both private and public, was defined with a four-tier strategy for migration from analogue to digital radio (DAB+ broadcast; hybrid radio; single online radio player and radio on TV). In summer 2011 the Parliament of the French-speaking Community adopted unanimously a resolution asking the French-speaking Government to support the migration to digital radio from 2011 onwards.\n\nThe CSA (regulator) launched a public consultation about digital radio in autumn 2011 which provided positive feedback. In spring 2012, the CSA recommended to the Government a DAB+ rollout based mainly on two layers in Band III. In June 2012 the Government authorized RTBF to proceed with DAB+ trials for commercial and non-profit radio stations licensed by the CSA.\n\nThe next step is to achieve a public funding agreement to finance the investments needed for the technical DAB+ rollout, upgrade of the RTBF DAB network to DAB+ to ensure deep indoor coverage of Brussels and Wallonia, for a potential public launch in 2015 (to mark the 101st anniversary of the first radio broadcasting in Belgium). RTBF is testing Radio DNS interactive slideshows on its DAB+ channels.\n\n===Flemish (Flanders and Brussels)===\n\nThe [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie]] (VRT) is the public broadcaster for the Belgian Flemish Community.

Nantes was already allowed until the end of the year. \nIn January 2012 it was reported by the French newspaper \u2018Les Echos\u2019 that the CSA had requested the Ministry of Industry to include DAB+ in the technical standard for France. The consultation for this closed in May 2012 and the technical decree was released 16 August 2013, including DAB+ to the list of permitted standards. At the end of 2007, France's Government announced that the official standard for digital radio in France would be DMB-A, to be marketed as Radio Num\u00e9rique Terrestre (RNT).\n\nAt the end of 2013, the French Parliament will examine an update of the 1986 law about radio and television. Then the CSA should publish a timetable for a call for applications for tenders for digital terrestrial licenses for France's next 20 biggest cities which will add up to 62% coverage. An additional tender will also allow to add DAB+ services to the 14 multiplexes in Paris, Marseille and Nice, as well as five more multiplexes in these towns.\n\nIn April 2012 the CSA re-launched a call of tender for three cities (Paris for seven multiplexes, Marseille and Nice for six multiplexes each). The four main commercial radio groups decided do not bid and the government did not allow the public service (Radio France) to pre-empt frequencies. At the beginning of October 2012 the CSA published the candidates selected for the three cities. At the beginning of 2014, six multiplexes will be on air in Paris, four in Marseille and four in Nice.\n\nRoll out of terrestrial digital radio was scheduled to start in December 2009 but was postponed amid opposition from several sources, including private radio operators. The Prime Minister commissioned a further report by David Kessler, former chief executive France Culture, which was published in mid-2011 and suggested that the conditions had not been met for the full scale deployment of digital radio in France. The report suggested a moratorium of two to three years during which time the French market would look at\nthe deployment of digital radio in the rest of Europe. The report also stated that the government approved the CSA's decision to allow further trials to continue.\n\nThe CSA is responsible for taking the findings of the Kessler report forward and in order to do this set up an \u2018Observatory\u2019 which includes all of the industry players. The publication of the Kessler report meant the market could move forward after a period of stagnation and to this end various trials were put on-air (Paris, Nantes, Marseille and Lyon).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/france|title=France &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220000457/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/france|archive-date=20 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Germany==\nBy the end of 2013 more than 120 national, regional and local programs will be broadcast in Germany. Also more than 90% of the German population can listen to at least one digital radio ensemble. This is considered to be a respectable success two years after the launch.\n\nDespite some changes in the national multiplex, the prospect for both commercial and public broadcasters is very positive as receiver sales are increasing. Furthermore, a stable ecosystem of private digital radio stations could be established in metropolitan areas such as Frankfurt, Berlin and Munich.\n\nThe current focus of broadcasters and network operators is to continue their marketing efforts in all media. For this reason the initiative \u2018Digitalradio Deutschland\u2019 was founded by the commercial broadcasters on the national multiplex (represented by DRD GmbH), the ARD group, Deutschlandradio and the network operator Media Broadcast. The goal is to coordinate the b2b and b2c marketing initiatives of all stakeholders to foster the evolution of digital radio in Germany by obtaining a reasonable market penetration by end of 2014.\n\nCoordination with the device industry is carried out via the initiative \u2018Digitalradio Deutschland\u2019, organised by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi). Five working groups were created to guide all areas of digital radio development and roll out, such as receiver/devices, data and traffic services, networks or advertisements.\n\nThe initiative hired consumer electronics market professionals which significantly improved the communication with the retailers. Many stores are now equipped with in-house-coverage solutions. The German car manufacturers offer DAB+ receivers for nearly all models either as an option or line fit. Two commercial telematics service providers use data capacity on the national mux to transmit TPEG based traffic information via DAB. The impressive coverage of Germany's highways over the last two years was secured through market collaboration and support for the technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/germany|title=Germany &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724032907/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/germany|archive-date=24 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Ghana==\nOn 14 May 2008 FonTV, Africa's first mobile phone enabled television content service, was launched via DMB.

The sole DAB+ equipment (from head-end to transmitter) are owned and operated by the public broadcaster, Radio TV Malaysia (RTM).\n\nIn February 2013, RTM invited local agencies such as the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), various members of the local radio industry and Telecoms Malaysia to a joint field trial study. Some elements of the field trials included identifying minimum reception figures for in building reception loss, minimum figures for acceptable mobile reception and speed tests.\n\nConsidering the conservative power of the trial DAB+ transmitter of 1&nbsp;kW, the results of the field trial looks promising and are in line with figures already established by the ITU and in broadcasting agencies in Australia.\n15 FM radio programs are available on the DAB+ platform, nine from RTM and six from the commercial radio stations.\n\nEfforts are underway to study/familiarise staff with other aspects of the DAB+ system such as adding Slideshow (SLS) and text (DL) in order to maximize the full potential of DAB+. Therefore, Malaysia is still gaining familiarity, experience and confidence with DAB+ technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/malaysia|title=Malaysia &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Malta==\nMalta was the first European country to roll out a DAB+ network and services were on-air in October 2008. There\nare nearly 40 services on the two national multiplexes which include unique digital only stations, MOT, EPG and DLS applications. The multiplexes are operated by Digi B Network and cover 100% of the population. By the end of 2012, over 25% of Maltese radio listeners were tuning in via DAB+.\n\nA second national mux (6A \u2013 Digi B2) was launched in 2011. The use of the digital radio platform has increased by 4.12% to 13% over the same period last year (January\u2013March 2012) and the use of FM has dropped by 7%.

The trials were not well received by northern Mexican radio stations, whose owners feared losing access to American audiences, as that country had already decided against DAB. While there was support for digital radio via the DAB family of standards among some Mexican broadcasters, the primary use of the L-band in Mexico is for maritime transmissions and space communications.\n\nIn 2008, the [[Cofetel|Federal Telecommunications Commission]] authorized IBOC for all stations within {{convert|320|km|mi}} of the US border.<ref>\"Mexico Authorizes Transmission of HD Radio Broadcasting\", ''Wireless News'' 27 May 2008</ref> In 2011, Cofetel allowed other stations in the country to use IBOC.\n\n==Monaco==\nA T-DMB test was carried out in VHF Band III on Channel 6A between July 2009 and September 2009. Monaco and the area around it has a transmitter, but due to some on-going technical issues, at present digital radio in Monaco is on hold.\n\nPrior to this, the principality of Monaco broadcast DAB digital radio services to 100% of its population of 32,000 people since 2005.

The conditions for the transition were:\n\n# Coverage (absolute condition for FM shutdown): Before 2015, the public broadcaster NRK must achieve coverage of 99.5%, the commercial broadcasters on the national network #1 are required to reach 90% of the population\n#Value added for the listeners (absolute condition for FM shutdown). There must be a value added for the listeners in going from FM to DAB, both in terms of available content and in terms of user experience.\n#Digital listening (condition to be met in order to shut down FM in 2017. Failure to reach it can postpone the shutdown until 2019). Before 2015 50% of the radio listeners must daily use a digital radio platform (currently this is 45%). This does not specify market share of listening, contrary to the UK requirement, only reach. \"Digital platform\" also includes listening via internet and via the digital TV network. This condition is set in order to measure the listeners' independence of the analogue FM-platform.\n#In-car solution (condition to be met in order to shut down FM in 2017. Failure to reach it can postpone the shutdown until 2019). Before 2015, there must be reasonably priced, well-functioning in-car adaptors on the market. In half of all Norwegian municipalities there must be an offer of in-car DAB-adaptor installation.\n\nAfter 2017, local stations, except for stations in major cities, will have the option to continue FM broadcasting. The report leaves it to the broadcasters to choose between DAB or DAB+ transmissions. By 2017, all DAB broadcasting in Norway is in DAB+ format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/norway|title=Norway &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\nThe switch-off of national FM broadcasting proved controversial and provoked a public backlash. NRK also faced a significant drop in listening figures following the switch-off.\n\n==Poland==\nAs of September 2016, Poland has one nationwide DAB+ multiplex, which consists of eight nationwide stations:\n* 4 FM-available stations ([[Polskie Radio Program I|Jedynka]], [[Polskie Radio Program II|Dw\u00f3jka]], [[Polskie Radio Program III|Tr\u00f3jka]], [[Polskie Radio 24|PR24]])\n* 3 DAB-only stations ([[Polskie Radio Program IV|Czw\u00f3rka]], Radio Dzieciom, Radio Rytm)\n* [[Polish Radio External Service|Radio Poland]] - DAB-only in Poland, but in some countries also on FM or SW.\nThe multiplex can include one or two regional stations (some of them also FM-available), but it differ between Polskie Radio regional stations. It can be received in many parts of the country thanks to twenty six transmitters, but due to very low listening figures and high costs plans for future extensions (also new stations) have been ceased and digital radio switch-off is proposed. \nThere are also two local test multiplexes in [[Siedlce]] and [[Rzesz\u00f3w]], which consist of local stations.\n\n==Portugal==\nExpansion of the DAB network awaits a decision by the Portuguese government.

Test broadcasting on said frequency began on 2. September 2016 from Krvavec transmitter, shortly after that RTV Slovenia began nationwide regular transmission on 19. September 2016.\n\n==South Africa==\nThe Joint SADIBA/NAB Digital Radio DAB+ Trial Working group's application for a high\u2013powered DAB+ trial licence has been approved. The trial licence was granted to the South African Broadcasting Corporation (the applicant on behalf of the NAB radio members) by the regulator, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA). The trial will run from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015, and Sentech will be the signal distributor for the duration of the trial.\n\nThe SADIBA/NAB Working group is encouraged by the commitment of all stakeholders in putting digital radio firmly on the South African broadcasting agenda.\n\nThe South African DAB+ trial will consist of two high power transmitting stations (10&nbsp;kW transmitter power) 100&nbsp;kW ERP situated in Johannesburg and Pretoria in the province of Gauteng. The trial will operate as a SFN in VHF band III on Channel 13F on a frequency of 239.200&nbsp;MHz. This will happen after coverage verification at transmitter powers of 2&nbsp;kW, 5&nbsp;kW, and 10&nbsp;kW. The total area covered by the trial is 21185km2 and the total gross population covered is 10 705 387 (21.5% of total SA population). It is envisaged that between 18 and 20 radio from the Public, Commercial and Community sectors will participate in the trial. The trial will allow the testing of:\nEnd-to-end technical functionality\nExtent of portable mobile coverage\nSignal permeability\nDemonstrate digital radio services and value-added services\nPerformance in the field using typical consumer equipment and professional test and measurement equipment.\nThe effects of vehicle penetration loss, building penetration loss and clutter (e.g. buildings and vegetation) on coverage.\nTesting of the various encoding methods (stereo, para stereo, mono) for different audio types and at different bit rates to get a good understanding of what bit rates/encoding to use for the different program types.\nInvestigate the delivery of PAD within these tests, synchronisation with the audio and rate of change of the images.  \nIn July 2013 over 200 radio industry representatives came together at the South African Broadcasting Corporation's (SABC) facility in Johannesburg to attend a landmark workshop on the rollout of DAB+ digital radio and to discuss plans for a high-powered DAB+ trial transmission extending from Pretoria to Johannesburg by end 2013. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), indicated that it stands ready to support broadcasting innovation in South Africa, which will be the first country to exploit opportunities for delivery of educational services via DAB+, as well as services for those with disabilities. Broadcasting radio via DAB+ will also allow ICASA to license new entrants where FM bandwidth is congested.\n\nMobileTV PTY performed technical tests of DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadcasting) and DAB+ in Gauteng from August 2011 until the end of July 2013 and plans to expand trials in South Africa. The prospective broadcaster will launch trials of DMB technology in the Free State and the Western Cape before the end of the 2013. In July 2012 they applied for a commercial license and expect to get an answer during 2013. ICASA has granted test licences for Cape and Bloemfontein, while assessing new applications for Port Eliazbeth, East London and Mpumalanga. MobileTV PTY aims to switch on the trials in Cape Town and Bloemfontein on 1 October and 1 November respectively. Their two transmitters will be relocated from Pretoria and Johannesburg Autumn 2013.\n\nMobileTV PTY ran two TV channels and one radio station on a test license. If a license is granted they would then cover 15-20 million of the 45 million people in South Africa and expand coverage in parallel to sales of devices and uptake of services. MobileTV PTY has teamed up with SABC, the public service broadcaster in South Africa. SABC reaches 76% of the population daily and is by far the biggest broadcaster and is partially financed by a TV license and partially by advertisements. MobileTV PTY is in dialogue with the Department of Education to evaluate whether the technology can be used for educational purposes, such as to reach rural schools and colleges in a cost-effective manner. The Department is primarily interested in the abilities of data transfer but an educational TV channel has not been ruled out. SABC will offer their 18 radio channels. MobileTV PTY wishes to also offer distribution for private radio stations following the launch.\n\nNo programmes are on air. Mobile TV PTY is awaiting a commercial license from the government. If licences are granted they will within the first year cover up to 50% of the population of South Africa, although they aim to increase this to between 80 and 90% within 2\u20133 years. Their plan is to broadcast 6-10 mobile TV channels and two radio stations. Additional services that combine broadcasting and the internet on the same device will be an essential part of their business model. Such services include traffic information, gambling, integration with social media and touch-screen shopping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-africa|title=South Africa &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==South Korea==\nAs the first country to commercially launch mobile TV, South Korea is the most successful DMB market in the world. More than 62 million DMB enabled devices have been sold, of which the most popular are mobile phones. This number is expected to rise even more with an increase in coverage; services already cover over 80% of the country. Hundreds of DMB devices are available in this market and usage of mobile TV increases year on year. Interactive services are also growing in popularity adding value to broadcasting services.\n\nThe Korean government has set up a digital audio project to recommend a digital audio broadcasting standard for Korea.  Following ETRI's investigation of various digital radio platforms, a major decision is expected regarding the adoption of a digital radio technology for South Korean broadcasters.\n\nKorea's latest innovation is an interactive mobile TV service, or Smart DMB, launched in May 2011 with six terrestrial-DMB operators (T-DMB). With Smart DMB, mobile TV viewers are able to search the internet, receive EPG information updates, and even enjoy \u2018TV Screen Capture and Share Service\u2019 through SNS while watching television. Moreover, hybrid DMB was launched in Aug 2013 for the high quality video service.\n\nA DAB+ trial has been on air in Seoul since December 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-korea|title=South Korea &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710122752/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-korea|archive-date=10 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Spain==\nA total of 18 DAB audio services are on air. Population coverage is currently 20%. The Spanish DAB Association ([http://www.radiodigitaldab.com/index.htm Asociaci\u00f3n Foro de la Radio Digital]) comprising both national private and public broadcasters, is responsible for DAB/DAB+ in Spain.\n\nSpain first began broadcasting terrestrial digital radio in April 1998 covering Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. From 2002 to June 2011, 23 transmitters covered the 52% of the Spanish population through three national multiplexes (1 SFN and 2 MFN). In addition, in some Comunidades Aut\u00f3nomas, DAB services were launched on additional regional multiplexes, but  they are currently switched off.\n\nThe Council of Ministers reached an agreement on Digital Radio in June 2011 and approved a Digitalisation Plan for Terrestrial Broadcasting with the following measures:\n\n#Reduction of DAB coverage from 52% to 20%, in order to facilitate a migration to DAB+\n#Flexibility for the broadcasters, in order to allow for  migration to DAB+\n#Study of a possible reassignment of the multiplexes\n#Promotional activities through the Spanish DAB Forum\n#DAB+ trials\n#A study of the necessary conditions to determine the date of  a possible analogue switch off<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/spain|title=Spain &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Sweden==\nDAB transmissions in Sweden started on 27 September 1995 and today the coverage (MUX1) is 35% of the population with services from public service broadcaster Swedish Radio (SR). The license under which SR operates is valid until 31 December 2019.\n\nDuring the years several propositions have been put forward to the Parliament suggesting a larger digital radio network roll-out for public service broadcaster SR. This is seen as the first step to a switchover from analogue FM to digital DAB/DAB+.\n\nIn 2009, trial transmissions of DAB+ started and the coverage (MUX 2) quickly reached 22% of the population with 16 services from public service radio, commercial radio and community local radio.\n\nIn 2010, the Radio and TV Act came into effect which, for the first time, allowed commercial radio companies to apply for digital licenses. This paved the way for a radio industry united behind DAB+, something for which both public and commercial services have been lobbying for. At the same time, the Swedish Government allocated spectrum for a total of four nationwide multiplexers in VHF band III to digital radio DAB/DAB+. Two multiplexers are reserved for SR and two multiplexers are reserved for commercial radio. Three of the multiplexers are regionally MFNs and one multiplexer is a nationwide SFN on channel 12B.\n\nIn 2012, the license regulator (MRTV) started the license process for commercial digital radio. All major commercial broadcasters, representing 91% of all listening not counting SR, applied for a total of 22 audio programme licenses spread over 2 commercial multiplexers.\n\nIn 2013, the Government appointed a Digital radio Industry Coordinator to put forward a Digital Switchover (DSO) plan at the latest in November 2014 after consultation with SR and the commercial radio broadcasters. The purpose of this plan is to put forward a proposition on DSO for a decision by the Swedish Parliament.\n \t\nIn 2014 the radio industry saw the commercial licenses issued. However the Switchover Plan put forward by the Digital Radio Industry Coordinator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/sweden|title=Sweden &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref> was rejected  by the government June 2015 after a negative consultation round which included the telecom authority (PTS).

In the middle of October 2012 the standard DAB was switched to the standard DAB+. Two to three programs per region will remain on simulcast service DAB/DAB+ until 2015.\n\nThe original four multiplexes are run by the public broadcaster SRG SSR, the first commercial DAB+ multiplex which was launched on 13 October 2009 now broadcasts 14 commercial radio stations in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. A second local commercial DAB+ multiplex started in December 2012 in the German-speaking part with six commercial radio- and three public radio stations and a first regional commercial DAB+ multiplex in the French-speaking part will start at the end of 2013.\n\nSwitzerland first launched DAB digital radio services in 1999 when the public broadcaster, SRG SSR went on air. Marketing activities started in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/switzerland|title=Switzerland &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2016, the stations regulated by public law will have fully migrated from DAB to DAB+,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dabplus.ch/|title=Radio zieht um|website=www.dabplus.ch}}</ref> while FM broadcasts will cease in 2024.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medienwoche.ch/2014/05/27/radio-ab-2024-nur-noch-digital/|title=Radio ab 2024 nur noch digital|date=27 May 2014|website=MEDIENWOCHE}}</ref>\n\n==Taiwan (Republic of China)==\nThe Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC), a private network with nationwide coverage, operates three FM and three AM channels as well as a digital audio broadcasting system. In July 2010, the Government of the [[Republic of China]] announced plans for digital convergence by 2015. During the first stage of the program, from 2010 through 2012, a number of bills being formulated and sent to the legislature for review, including a radio and TV broadcast law. Taiwan has been a supporter of DAB and DAB+ broadcasting and planned for a full implementation of digital broadcasting (both TV and radio) by 2010. Lack of marketing, promotion and consumer awareness has slowed this digital expansion. The new laws being developed should set a firm timeline in place for digital conversion of all media and telecoms. DAB in Taiwan is solely operated by SuperFM on a trial basis. There are seven trial services available including one DMB.\n\nSuperFM broadcasts multiple foreign language programmes, for example in Vietnamese, Thai and Filipino aimed at foreign nationals living in Taiwan but who are unable to listen to their home nation's radio programmes via analogue radio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/chinese-taipei|title=Chinese Taipei &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Thailand==\nFollowing the successful licence auction for commercial digital TV channels in December 2013, the [[National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission]] (NBTC) is looking to auction about 4,000 similar licences for digital radio in early 2015.\n\nThe licences would be in the nationwide and region-wide categories. There are expected to about 20 nationwide licences. The auction will be held on a phase-by-phase basis.\n\nThe NBTC's broadcasting committee will sign a memorandum of understanding with MCOT, the Public Relations Department and the Royal Thai Army at the end of January 2014 to conduct a year-long trial of digital radio broadcasting.\n\nThe digital radio service will be provided on VHF (very high frequency) bands that will be returned to the NBTC by the state agencies that own existing analog TV concessions.\n\nThe existing analog AM and FM radio frequencies will be allocated for community and public radio. There are 525 AM and FM channels nationwide.\n\nThe estimated final price of a commercial digital radio licence would be around Bt100,000. About 10 licences to provide network services to the prospective digital radio operators will also be granted.\n\nThe first Thailand Broadcasting Master Plan (2012-2016) states strategies for digital terrestrial radio roll-out, roadmap and policy for digital terrestrial radio roll-out within two years, after the adoption of the Master Plan.\nDAB+ demonstrations started in Bangkok on 1 March 2013. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), jointly organised the \"NBTC/ITU Workshop on Digital Radio Technologies\" held in Bangkok, Thailand, 1\u20133 March 2013. The Workshop was supported by WorldDMB, MCOT Public Co., LTd., the Government Public Relations Department, and the Royal Thai Army Radio and Television Station.\n\nNBTC is in the process of developing a policy document for digital radio services that will be published in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/thailand|title=Thailand &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Turkey==\nTRT, the Turkish Broadcasting Corporation, has aired DAB test transmissions broadcasting four simulcast services in Band III and covering the capital, Ankara.

Argentine submarine {{ship|ARA|San Luis|S-32|6}} fired a torpedo which smashed ''Arrow''{{'}}s [[Sonar decoy|towed decoy]].<ref name=\"Bootherstone\"/> A second torpedo impacted the ship's hull but failed to detonate due to the warhead failing to arm itself prior to impact.<ref>https://type21club.org/about-the-type21-warships/</ref>\n\nFrom 21 May, she supported troops of the Second Battalion the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] (2 Para) in the successful attack at [[Goose Green]].<ref>Referenced in [http://www.freemasonrytoday.com/17/p03.php?printnice=yes this] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216044523/http://www.freemasonrytoday.com/17/p03.php?printnice=yes |date=16 December 2010 }} report.</ref>\n\n''Arrow'' survived Bomb Alley (San Carlos Water anchorage) longer than any other ship.  During this time she received temporary repairs to hull cracks - Seadart lifting beams were welded to her upper decks on each side.\n\nOn rejoining the Task Force datalink she was greeted with 'I thought you were sunk'.  On passage east at night ''Arrow'' detected an unknown surface target inshore - to identify the vessel she closed and fired 3 star-shells over what turned out to be a UK [[Landing Craft Mechanised]] (LCM) which was then escorted to Berkeley Sound.  This was the last Mk 8 illuminant fired in conflict.\n\n''Arrow'' also gave covering fire in the lead up to the surrender of Port Stanley. By war's end, she had destroyed three Argentine aircraft, seven gun emplacements and two radar stations.<ref name =\"Navy News\">{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/navynews/docs/198208|title=Flying salute as Arrow sails home|newspaper=Navy News p.23|date=August 1982}}</ref>\n\n==Argentine claim==\nThe silhouette of ''Arrow'' is to be found, along with the date 1 May, painted on the side of Argentine Air Force [[Dassault Mirage 5]]/IAI Dagger serial number C-412, along with a similar silhouette representation of {{HMS|Brilliant|F90|6}} and the date 21 May, implying a successful action by the aircrew against these vessels. These ''kill markings'' are however overstated, and refer merely to damage which both ships suffered during the conflict, which may or may not have been caused by this particular aircraft. ''Arrow'' was slightly damaged by cannon fire on 1 May 1982, and HMS ''Brilliant'' was slightly damaged by cannon fire on 21 May 1982 outside [[San Carlos Water]]. The aircraft was reportedly observed still bearing these distinguishing marks as late as November 2005 (twenty-three years after the conflict) at the multi-national ''Exercise Ceibo'' in [[Argentina]].\n\n==Later Royal Navy service==\nBy the mid-1980s ''Arrow'' was suffering from cracking in her hull. Much of this had first arisen during the Falklands conflict, when engineers were obliged to weld steel plates and girders to parts of the ship where cracks were opening up in the aluminium superstructure.<ref>These facts are fully referenced, with photographs, by the wartime crew [http://www.davesnavy.co.uk/arrow.html at this location] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314055607/http://www.davesnavy.co.uk/arrow.html |date=14 March 2012 }}.</ref> After the war she was taken in for refitting, with a large steel plate being welded down each side of the ship. At the same time modifications were made to reduce hull noise.\n\nIn early 1985, ''Arrow'' spent 3{{frac|1|2}} months as Guardship in the West Indies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arrow Homes in from Windies|newspaper=[[Navy News]] |date=May 1985 |p=15 |url=https://issuu.com/navynews/docs/198505 |accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref> The vessel continued in service until 1994, and was decommissioned and removed from the fleet on 1 March that year.\n\n==Pakistan Navy service==\n\n{{other ships|PNS Khaibar}}\n\nFollowing decommissioning ''Arrow'' was transferred to [[Pakistan]] and renamed PNS ''Khaibar''.<ref>[http://www.helis.com/database/unit/567_PNS_Khaibar/ D-183 PNS Khaibar]</ref> The [[Exocet]] missile system was not transferred to Pakistan and ''Khaibar'' had her obsolete [[Sea Cat missile]] launcher removed. A [[Phalanx CIWS]] was later fitted in place of the Sea Cat launcher. [[Mark 36 SRBOC|SRBOC chaff]] launchers and 20&nbsp;mm and 30&nbsp;mm guns were fitted. ''Khaibar'' remains in service with the [[Pakistan Navy]], who purchased from the United Kingdom Government all six surviving Type 21 frigates of the eight originally built (two were lost in the Falklands).<ref>Referenced [http://www.battleships-cruisers.co.uk/amazon_class.htm#HMS%20Arrow at this site].</ref>\n\n==References==\n* AirForces Monthly Magazine February 2006, page 61.\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Publications==\n* {{colledge}}\n* Marriott, Leo, 1983.

One day Ali's mother ([[Shamim Hilaly]]) suggests Ali that he should marry Alizeh to which he happily agrees. Ali shares this with Neha but doesn't reveal it to her whom his mother has suggested him to marry. When Alizeh gets to know this she gets annoyed and angry. And thus, the next day Neha comes to her and informs her that it is she herself whom Ali is going to marry, hearing which Alizeh gets disturbed and starts avoiding Ali or the next few days. When confronted by Ali at office one day, she shouts on him and asks him that how marriage can come between their friendship.\n\nFinding no ray of hope, Ali goes to Neha and asks her to marry him. And when Alizeh gets to know this she becomes ecstatic and actively participates in the preparations of the wedding. Finally Neha also confesses to Ali that she had always loved him and agrees to marry him. Ali unwillingly marries her and even on the wedding night he confronts Alizeh and asks her to marry him, but she refuses once again.\n\nNeha and Ali are now living a happy married life together but Alizeh starts hiding herself and her feelings from others. She begins to stay out of home for long hours, comes back home late and even experiences depression. Every time Ali goes out to find her and bring her back home. This disturbs Neha who begins to feel that Ali has not been able to forget Alizeh. At the same time Alizeh befriends a man named Farooq Saad ([[Javed Sheikh]]), who is of the age of her father and is the husband of a woman named Parizaad ([[Samina Peerzada]]), who is suffering from a mental disorder. Alizeh's new friendship disturbs her parents (Hina Khawaja Bayat [[Asif Raza Mir]]) but she keeps on meeting Farooq Saad. Fed up by Alizeh's behaviour and sudden disappearances, Ali finally confesses it to her that her actions are causing problems in his life. This hurts Alizeh who, the next day, reaches Ali's home to beg pardon. But when she gets to know that he and Neha have gone for honeymoon she gets disheartened and comes back home.\n\nDetermined to show Ali that she can make other friends than him, a jealous Alizeh, who now hides that she repents not marrying Ali, decides to marry Farooq Saad. When Ali gets to know this he gets disturbed and further informs Neha, who visits Alizeh the same day. Neha says her that she is not happy with Ali and asks her to take Ali from him. She also warns her that she won't let her marry a man of that age and destroy her life. That same night, when Neha comes back home she is questioned about Alizeh by Ali. A tormented Neha asks him why he couldn't forget her and also asks him to stop bothering her and to focus on their life instead. Neha thus, asks Ali to make a choice between her and Alizeh.\n\nThe next day, Alizeh meets Farooq Saad and says that she wants to marry him, which enrages him. He finally confesses that he and Alizeh's mother (Hina Khawaja Bayat) had once loved each other and that he had promised her not to come back in her life again and this shocks Alizeh. He further informs her that he and Parizaad are leaving for their home in Iran soon. A disheartened Alizeh comes to Ali's home that night and confesses over a cup of coffee that she had always loved him but even after knowing it she had always neglected it. And saying that she is leaving for London, the next day, she leaves Ali's home. Neither does Alizeh stop nor does Ali stop her. He lets her go and thus, Ali chooses Neha, instead of Alizeh.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sarwat Gilani]] as Alizeh\n* [[Humayun Saeed]] as Ali\n* [[Aamina Sheikh]] as Neha\n* [[Samina Peerzada]] as Parizaad\n* [[Javed Sheikh]] as Farooq Saad\n* [[Hina Khawaja Bayat]] as Alizeh's mother\n* [[Asif Raza Mir]] as Alizeh's father\n* [[Shamim Hilaly]] as Ali's mother\n* Lubna Aslam as Neha's mother\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Hum TV Programs}}{{Programmes broadcast by Zindagi}}{{Pakistan-tv-stub}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ishq Gumshuda}}\n\n[[Category:Urdu language telenovelas]]\n[[Category:Pakistani telenovelas]]\n[[Category:2010 telenovelas]]\n[[Category:2010 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010 Pakistani television series endings]]\n[[Category:Hum TV series]]\n[[Category:Zindagi television series]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2016}}\n{{Use Pakistani English|date=September 2016}}\n{{Infobox television\n | show_name = Ishq Gumshuda\n | image = Ishq Gumshuda poster.jpg\n | caption = poster of ''Ishq Gumshuda'' released by [[Hum TV]]\n | writer = Noor-ul-Hada Shah\n | director = Haissam Hussain \n | genre =  [[Drama]]\n | runtime = 45\u201350 minutes\n | creator = [[Momina Duraid]]\n | starring =\n | opentheme = \n | country = Pakistan \n | network = [[Hum TV]]\n | first_aired = 25 June 2010\n | last_aired = 2010\n | num_episodes = 22\n | list_episodes = \n | executive_producer = [[Momina Duraid]]\n | company = \n | followed_by =\n | website = http://www.Hum.TV\n}}\n'''''Ishq Gumshuda''''' ({{lang-ur|{{nastaliq|\u0639\u0634\u0642 \u06af\u0645\u0634\u062f\u06c1}}}}) is a [[Urdu]] language [[Pakistani dramas|Pakistani telenovela]] which was first broadcast in Pakistan in 2010 by [[Hum TV]], premiering on 25 June 2010.
