Hinckley played a prominent part in the [[English Civil War]].<ref>[http://www.hinckleypastpresent.org/civilwarhinckley.html Hinckley in the Civil War] Hinckley Past & Present</ref> Its proximity to several rival strongholds\u2014the royalist garrisons at Caldicote, [[Ashby de la Zouch]] and Leicester, those of the Parliamentarians at [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] and [[Coventry]], and the presence of parties of troops or brigands occupying several fortified houses in nearby Warwickshire\u2014ensured frequent visits by the warring parties. The local townsfolk were forced to decide whether to declare their allegiances openly or attempt to remain neutral\u2014with the risk of having to pay levies, ransoms, and fines to both sides. In March 1644, Hinckley was occupied by a group of [[Cavalier|Royalist]] troops, though they were soon driven out by a force of [[roundhead|Parliamentarian]]s, who took many prisoners.\n\nThe Civil War years were a particularly unsettled time for the clergy in and around Hinckley. Parsons with parliamentary leanings like Thomas Cleveland, the vicar of Hinckley, suffered [[Committee for Compounding with Delinquents|sequestration by the Leicester County Committee]], like some of his \"malignant\" neighbours accused of visiting royalist garrisons or preaching against Parliament.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe town was visited by both parliamentary and royalists troops from the rival garrisons, particularly parliamentary troops from Tamworth, Coventry and [[Astley Castle]] in Warwickshire. Troops from Coventry garrison were particularly active in the town, taking horses and \"free quarter\" and availing themselves of 'dyett and Beere', and taking some of the inhabitants hostage for ransom. Royalist troops raided the town to threaten those with parliamentary sympathies. The notorious Lord Hastings of Ashby de la Zouch is recorded to have \"coursed about the country as far as Dunton and Lutterworth and took near upon a hundred of the clergymen and others, and carried them prisoners \u2026 threatening to hang all them that should take the Parliament's Covenant\". Parliamentary newssheets record that on the night of 4 March 1644, Hastings's men brought in \"26 honest countrymen from several towns\" intending to take them to Ashby de la Zouch, along with a huge herd of cattle, oxen and horses from the country people and a minister named Mr Warner. These prisoners were herded into Hinckley church and asked \"in a jeering manner, 'Where are the Round-heads your brethren at Leicester? Why come they not to redeem you?'\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n[[File:Davis, Military window inscription.JPG|thumb|left|This inscription is part of a window in St Mary's church, Hinckley]]\nThe Parliamentarians responded in a memorable \"Skirmish or Great Victory for Parliament\". Colonel Grey with 120 foot-soldiers and 30 troopers from Bagworth House rushed to Hinckley and re-took the town, routed the Royalists, rescued the cattle and released their imprisoned countrymen. No doubt the inhabitants of the town were as relieved as any when Ashby finally surrendered, as Vicars records, \"a great mercy and mighty preservation of the peace and tranquility of all those adjacent parts about it.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n[[File:Hinckley, Leicestershire.jpg|thumb|Map of Hinckley and its surroundings dated 1786]]\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAt the time of the first national census in 1801, Hinckley had a population of 5,158: twenty years later it had increased by about a thousand. The largest industry in the early 19th century was the making of hosiery and only Leicester had a larger output of stockings. In the district, it was estimated ca. 1830 that 6,000 persons were employed in this work.<ref>Curtis, John (1831) ''A Topographical History of the County of Leicester'' Ashby-de-la-Zouch: W.

The corner stone was laid by Sir John Fowke Lancelot Rolleston.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThis hospital was central to the people of Hinckley and supported by local workers who donated one penny a week for its upkeep until it was adopted by the NHS in 1948.

It is reputed that, many years ago, one of the itinerant sheep drovers bragged that he could drink a hat full of ale. The local landlord put this man to the test by getting the local blacksmith to make a tin hat, which he then filled with ale. Thereafter, the town became known as \"Tin 'At\". Another explanation is that the people of Hinckley used to place buckets on water pumps to keep them clean and prevent the spread of illness, the bucket obviously being the \"Tin 'At\". A tin hat can be seen on top of the flag pole which sits on the roof of the Coral branch at the corner of Castle Street and Market Place.

The local townsfolk were forced to decide whether to declare their allegiances openly or attempt to remain neutral\u2014with the risk of having to pay levies, ransoms, and fines to both sides. In March 1644, Hinckley was occupied by a group of [[Cavalier|Royalist]] troops, though they were soon driven out by a force of [[roundhead|Parliamentarian]]s, who took many prisoners.\n\nThe Civil War years were a particularly unsettled time for the clergy in and around Hinckley. Parsons with parliamentary leanings like Thomas Cleveland, the vicar of Hinckley, suffered [[Committee for Compounding with Delinquents|sequestration by the Leicester County Committee]], like some of his \"malignant\" neighbours accused of visiting royalist garrisons or preaching against Parliament.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe town was visited by both parliamentary and royalists troops from the rival garrisons, particularly parliamentary troops from Tamworth, Coventry and [[Astley Castle]] in Warwickshire. Troops from Coventry garrison were particularly active in the town, taking horses and \"free quarter\" and availing themselves of 'dyett and Beere', and taking some of the inhabitants hostage for ransom. Royalist troops raided the town to threaten those with parliamentary sympathies. The notorious Lord Hastings of Ashby de la Zouch is recorded to have \"coursed about the country as far as Dunton and Lutterworth and took near upon a hundred of the clergymen and others, and carried them prisoners \u2026 threatening to hang all them that should take the Parliament's Covenant\". Parliamentary newssheets record that on the night of 4 March 1644, Hastings's men brought in \"26 honest countrymen from several towns\" intending to take them to Ashby de la Zouch, along with a huge herd of cattle, oxen and horses from the country people and a minister named Mr Warner. These prisoners were herded into Hinckley church and asked \"in a jeering manner, 'Where are the Round-heads your brethren at Leicester? Why come they not to redeem you?'\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n[[File:Davis, Military window inscription.JPG|thumb|left|This inscription is part of a window in St Mary's church, Hinckley]]\nThe Parliamentarians responded in a memorable \"Skirmish or Great Victory for Parliament\". Colonel Grey with 120 foot-soldiers and 30 troopers from Bagworth House rushed to Hinckley and re-took the town, routed the Royalists, rescued the cattle and released their imprisoned countrymen. No doubt the inhabitants of the town were as relieved as any when Ashby finally surrendered, as Vicars records, \"a great mercy and mighty preservation of the peace and tranquility of all those adjacent parts about it.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n[[File:Hinckley, Leicestershire.jpg|thumb|Map of Hinckley and its surroundings dated 1786]]\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAt the time of the first national census in 1801, Hinckley had a population of 5,158: twenty years later it had increased by about a thousand.

It is reputed that, many years ago, one of the itinerant sheep drovers bragged that he could drink a hat full of ale. The local landlord put this man to the test by getting the local blacksmith to make a tin hat, which he then filled with ale. Thereafter, the town became known as \"Tin 'At\". Another explanation is that the people of Hinckley used to place buckets on water pumps to keep them clean and prevent the spread of illness, the bucket obviously being the \"Tin 'At\".

[...] Wealth will be produced and distributed in its natural form of useful things, of objects that can serve to satisfy some human need or other. Not being produced for sale on a market, items of wealth will not acquire an exchange-value in addition to their use-value.

For example, [[Alexandre Vinet]], who claimed to have been the first person to use the term, defined socialism simply as \"the opposite of [[individualism]]\".<ref>Cort, John C. ''\"Christian socialism\"''. Orbis Books, New York, 1988. pp. 355.</ref> [[Robert Owen]] also viewed socialism as a matter of ethics, although he used it with a slightly more specific meaning to refer to the view that human society can and should be improved for the benefit of all. In a similar vein, [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] claimed that socialism is \"every aspiration towards the amelioration of society\".<ref>Boyle, James. ''\"What is Socialism?\"'', The Shakespeare Press, 1912. pp. 35.</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, many writers who described themselves as socialists\u2014and who would be later called [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]]\u2014wrote down descriptions of what they believed to be the ideal human society. Some of them also created small communities that put their ideals into practice. A constant feature of these ideal societies was social and economic [[egalitarianism|equality]]. Because the people who proposed the creation of such societies called themselves socialists, the term socialism came to refer not only to a certain moral doctrine, but also to a type of egalitarian society based on such a doctrine.\n\nOther early advocates of socialism took a more scientific approach by favouring social leveling to create a [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] society based upon freedom for individual talent to prosper,<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|website=www.fsmitha.com}}</ref> such as Count [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and believed a socialist society would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/|title=Welcome to the School of Politics &amp; International Relations|first1=Head of|last1=School|last2=admin.spirsocy@anu.edu.au|website=School of Politics & International Relations}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of this early socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref name=\"SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction\">''Newman, Michael''.

They reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated to prices charged by the producer when those commodities were in elastic supply and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labor&mdash;the cost of the labor (essentially the wages paid) that was required to produce the commodities. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712235906/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |archivedate=2015-07-12 }}</ref> These ideas embodied early conceptions of [[market socialism]].\n\nAfter the advent of [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Marxian economics|theory of capitalism]] and [[scientific socialism]], socialism came to refer to ownership and administration of the [[means of production]] by the working class, either through the state apparatus or through independent cooperatives. In [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, socialism refers to a specific stage of social and economic development that will displace capitalism, characterized by coordinated production, public or cooperative ownership of capital, diminishing class conflict and inequalities that spawn from such and the end of wage-labor with a method of compensation based on the principle of \"[[To each according to his contribution|From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economictheories.org/2008/07/karl-marx-socialism-and-scientific.html|title=Karl Marx Socialism and Scientific Communism|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Differences between various schools ==\nAlthough they share a common root (as elaborated upon in the above sections), schools of socialism are divided on many issues and sometimes there is a split within a school. The following is a brief overview of the major issues which have generated or are generating significant controversy amongst socialists in general.\n\n=== Theory ===\nSome branches of socialism arose largely as a philosophical construct (e.g. [[utopian socialism]])\u2014others in the heat of a revolution (e.g. [[Classical Marxism|early Marxism]] or [[Leninism]]). A few arose merely as the product of a ruling party (e.g. [[Stalinism]]), other as a product or various worker movements (e.g. [[anarcho-syndicalism]]), or a party or other group contending for political power in a democratic society (e.g. [[social democracy]]).\n\nSome are in favour of a socialist revolution (e.g. [[Maoism]], [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], [[revolutionary socialism]], [[social anarchism]] and [[Trotskyism]]) whilst others tend to support [[Reformism|reform]] instead (e.g. [[Fabianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]]). Others believe both are possible (e.g. [[syndicalism]] or various forms of [[Marxism]]). The first utopian socialists even failed to address the question of how a socialist society would be achieved, upholding the belief that technology was a necessity for a socialist society and that they themselves had no comprehension of the technology of the future.{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2016}}\n\nSocialists are also divided on which rights and liberties are desirable such as the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] liberties (like those guaranteed by the United States [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] or the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]). Some hold that they are to be preserved (or even enhanced) in a socialist society (e.g. [[anarchism]] or [[left communism]]) whilst others believe them to be undesirable (e.g. [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]]). [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] even held different opinions at different times and some schools are divided on this issue (e.g. different strains of Trotskyism).\n\nAll socialists criticize the current system in some way. Some criticisms center on the ownership of the means of production (e.g. Marxism) whereas others tend to focus on the nature of mass and equitable distribution (e.g. most forms of utopian socialism). Most are opposed to unchecked industrialism as well as capitalism (e.g. [[green left]]) and believe that under socialism the environment must be protected. Utopian socialists like [[Robert Owen]] and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] argued, although not from exactly the same perspective, that the injustice and widespread poverty of the societies they lived in were a problem of distribution of the goods created. On the other hand, Marxian socialists determined that the root of the injustice is based not in the function of distribution of goods already created, but rather in the fact that the ownership of the means of production is in the hands of the upper class. Marxian socialists also maintain in contrast to the utopian socialists that the root of injustice is not in how goods ([[commodity|commodities]]) are distributed, but for whose economic benefit are they produced and sold.\n\n=== Practice ===\nMost forms and derivatives of Marxism and anarchism advocated total or near-total socialization of the economy. Less radical schools (e.g. [[Bernsteinism]], [[reformism]] and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|reformist Marxism]]) proposed a mixed market economy instead. [[Mixed economy|Mixed economies]] can in turn range anywhere from those developed by the social democratic governments that have periodically governed Northern and Western European countries, to the inclusion of small [[cooperative]]s in the planned economy of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. A related issue is whether it is better to reform capitalism to create a fairer society (e.g. most social democrats) or to totally overthrow the capitalist system (all Marxists).\n\nSome schools advocate centralized state control of the socialized sectors of the economy (e.g. Leninism), whilst others argue for control of those sectors by [[workers' council]]s (e.g. [[anarcho-communism]], [[council communism]], left communism, Marxism or [[syndicalism]]). This question is usually referred to by socialists in terms of \"ownership of the [[means of production]]\". None of the social democratic parties of Europe advocate total state ownership of the means of production in their contemporary demands and popular press.\n\nAnother issue socialists are divided on is what legal and political apparatus the workers would maintain and further develop the socialization of the means of production. Some advocate that the power of the workers' councils should itself constitute the basis of a socialist state (coupled with [[direct democracy]] and the widespread use of [[referendum]]s), but others hold that socialism entails the existence of a legislative body administered by people who would be elected in a [[representative democracy]].\n\nDifferent ideologies support different governments. During the era of the Soviet Union, Western socialists were bitterly divided as to whether the Soviet Union was actually socialist, moving toward socialism, or inherently unsocialist and in fact inimical to true socialism. Similarly, today the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] claims to be socialist and refers to its own approach as [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]], but most other socialists consider China to be essentially capitalist. The Chinese leadership concurs with most of the usual [[#Opposition and criticisms of socialism|critiques against a command economy]] and many of their actions to manage what they call a socialist economy have been determined by this opinion.\n\n== Socialist planned economy ==\nThis form of socialism combines public ownership and management of the means of production with [[Planned economy|centralized state planning]] and can refer to a broad range of economic systems from the centralized [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet-style command economy]] to participatory planning via workplace democracy. In a centrally-planned economy decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced as well as the allocation of output (distribution of goods and services) are planned in advanced by a planning agency. This type of economic system was often combined with a one-party political system and is associated with the [[Communist state]]s of the 20th century.\n\n=== State-directed economy ===\nA state-directed economy is a system where either the state or [[worker cooperative]]s own the means of production, but economic activity is directed to some degree by a government agency or planning ministry through mechanisms such as [[indicative planning]] or dirigisme. This differs from a centralized planned economy, or a command economy, in that micro-economic decision making, such as quantity to be produced and output requirements, is left to managers and workers in state enterprises or cooperative enterprises rather than being mandated by a comprehensive economic plan from a centralized planning board. However, the state will plan long-term strategic investment and some aspect of production. It is possible for a state-directed economy to have elements of both a market and planned economy. For example, production and investment decisions may be semi-planned by the state, but distribution of output may be determined by the market mechanism.\n\nState-directed socialism can also refer to technocratic socialism\u2014economic systems that rely on technocratic management and technocratic planning mechanisms, along with public ownership of the means of production. A forerunner of this concept was [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who understood the state would undergo a transformation in a socialist system and change its role from one of \"political administration of men, to the administration of things\".\n\nElements of state-directed socialist economies include [[dirigisme]], [[economic planning]], [[state socialism]] and [[technocracy]].\n\n=== Decentralized planned economy ===\nA decentralized planned economy is one where ownership of enterprises is accomplished through various forms of [[Socialism#Self-managed economy|self-management]] and worker cooperatives in which planning of production and distribution is done from the bottom-up by local worker councils in a democratic manner. This form of socialist economy is related to the political philosophies of [[libertarian socialism]], [[syndicalism]] and various forms of communal utopian socialism.\n\nExamples of decentralized democratic planning include [[council communism]], [[individualist anarchism]], [[industrial democracy]], [[participatory economics]], [[Soviet democracy]] and [[syndicalism]].<ref name=\"Graham-2005\"/>\n\n== Market socialism ==\n{{main|Market socialism}}\nMarket socialism refers to various economic systems that involve either public ownership and management or worker cooperative ownership over the means of production, or a combination of both, and the market mechanism for allocating economic output, deciding what to produce and in what quantity. In state-oriented forms of market socialism where state enterprises attempt to maximize profit, the profits can fund government programs and services eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems.\n\nSome forms of market socialism are based on [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic theory]], with the aim of attaining [[pareto efficiency]] by setting price to equal marginal cost in public enterprises. This form of socialism was promoted by [[Oskar Lange]], [[Abba Lerner]] and Fredrick Taylor. Other forms of market socialism are based on [[classical economics]], such as those advocated by [[Thomas Hodgskin]], who viewed interest accumulation, rent and profit as deductions from exchange-value, so that eliminating the capitalist element from the economy would lead to a free market and socialism. The term market socialism has also been applied to planned economic systems that try to organize themselves partially along market-lines while retaining centralized state ownership of capital.\n\nExamples of market socialism include [[economic democracy]], the [[Lange model]], [[liberal socialism]], [[market-oriented left-libertarianism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] the [[New Economic Mechanism]] and [[Ricardian socialism]]. Other types of market socialist systems such as mutualism are related to the political philosophy of [[libertarian socialism]].\n\n=== Socialist market economy ===\nA socialist market economy refers to the economic systems adopted by the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]. Although there is dispute as to whether or not these models actually constitute [[state capitalism]], the decisive means of production remain under state-ownership. State enterprises are organized into corporations ([[corporatization]]) and operate like private capitalist enterprises. A substantial private sector exists alongside the state sector of the economy, but it plays a secondary role usually relegated to the service sector and production of consumer goods.\n\nExamples of socialist market economies include the [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics]] and the [[socialist-oriented market economy]].\n\n== Socialist ideologies ==\n=== Utopian socialism ===\n{{main|Utopian socialism}}\n[[File:Hw-fourier.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Charles Fourier]], influential French early socialist]]\nUtopian socialism is  a term used to define the first currents of modern [[Socialism|socialist]] thought as exemplified by the work of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]], which inspired [[Karl Marx]] and other early socialists.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/synopsis.html| title=Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism| publisher=Public Broadcasting System| accessdate=December 15, 2011}}</ref> However, visions of imaginary ideal societies, which competed with revolutionary social democratic movements, were viewed as not being grounded in the material conditions of society and as \"reactionary\".<ref name=Draper>{{cite book |last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution, Volume IV: Critique of Other Socialisms|year=1990|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-85345-798-5|pages=1\u201321}}</ref> Although it is technically possible for any set of ideas or any person living at any time in history to be a utopian socialist, the term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label \"utopian\" by later socialists as a negative term, in order to imply naivete and dismiss their ideas as fanciful or unrealistic.<ref name=\"SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction\"/> Forms of socialism which existed in traditional societies are referred to as [[primitive communism]] by Marxists.\n\nReligious sects whose members live communally, such as the [[Hutterites]], for example, are not usually called \"utopian socialists\", although their way of living is a prime example. They have been categorized as [[religious socialism|religious socialists]] by some. Likewise, modern [[intentional communities]] based on socialist ideas could also be categorized as \"utopian socialist\".\n\n=== Marxism ===\n{{main|Communism|Marxism}}\n[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Karl Marx]] (1818\u20131883)]]\nMarxism, or Marxist communism, refers to [[Classless society|classless]], [[Stateless society|stateless]] social organization based upon [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and to a variety of movements acting in the name of this goal which are influenced by the thought of Karl Marx. In general, the classless forms of social organisation are not capitalised, while movements associated with official [[communist parties]] and [[Communist states]] usually are. In the classic Marxist definition ([[pure communism]]), a communist economy refers to a system that has achieved a superabundance of goods and services due to an increase in technological capability and advances in the productive forces and therefore has transcended socialism  (see [[post-scarcity economy]]). This is a hypothetical stage of social and economic development with few speculative details known about it.\n\nThe actual goal of communism has never been attained in practice from a Marxist position, though anarchist societies have provided a glimpse of what a communist world would look like. The real idea behind it is to abolish all leadership, and govern with a [[commune]]. That is, the people themselves make all decisions, and everyone contributing to the wellbeing of the [[State (polity)|commune]]. In practice, most governments that have claimed to be communist have been [[totalitarian]] [[dictatorships]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe modern political marxist communist movement was created when the social democratic parties of Europe split between their rightist and leftist tendencies during World War I.  The leftists, led internationally by [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]], to distinguish their brand of socialism from the \"[[reformist]]\" social democrats, were called \"communists\".  However, after Luxemburg's and Liebknecht's murders the term communist became generally associated solely with the parties and organisations following Lenin, along with their various derivations, such as [[Stalinism]] or [[Maoism]].\n\nThere is a considerable variety of views among self-identified communists. However, [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]], [[school (discipline)|schools]] of communism associated with Karl Marx and of Vladimir Lenin respectively, have the distinction of having been a major force in world politics since the early 20th century. [[Class struggle]] plays a central role in Marxism. This theory views the formation of communism as the culmination of the class struggle between the capitalist class, the owners of most of the capital and the working class. Marx held that society could not be transformed from the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] to the communist mode of production all at once, but required a transitional state which Marx described as the revolutionary [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].\n\nSome forms of the communist society that Marx envisioned, as emerging from capitalism, have been claimed to be achieved for limited periods during certain historical moments and under certain circumstances. For example, the [[Paris Commune]] in fact let Marx reinforce and implement his theories by adapting them to a real experience he could draw from. Another similar case, though disputed by [[anarcho-syndicalism]] or even [[anarchism]], was the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] of 1936 (often missed or unmentioned by official [[historiography]]), during which much of Spain's economy in most of [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] areas, some of which enjoyed a practical absence of [[State (polity)|state]], was put under workers' direct collective control.\n\nIn addition to this, the term communism (as well as socialism) is often used to refer to those political and economic systems and states dominated by a political, bureaucratic class, typically attached to one [[One-party state|single]] [[Communist party]] that follow Marxist-Leninist doctrines and often claim to represent the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in a non-democratic fashion, described by critics as in a [[totalitarian]] and [[bureaucratic]]. These systems are also often called Stalinism, [[state capitalism]], [[state communism]] or [[state socialism]].\n\nWith the Soviet Union's creation after the end of [[Russian Civil War]] that followed to initial success of Red [[October Revolution]] in Russia, other socialist parties in other countries and the [[Bolshevik party]] itself became Communist parties, owing allegiance of varying degrees to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (see [[Communist International]]). After World War II, regimes calling themselves Communist took power in Eastern Europe. In 1949, the Communists in China, supported by Soviet Union and led by [[Mao Zedong]], came to power and established the [[People's Republic of China]]. Among the other countries in the [[Third World]] that adopted a bureaucratic [[Communist state]] as form of government at some point were Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Angola and Mozambique. By the early 1980s, almost one third of the world's population lived under Communist states.\n\nCommunism carries a strong [[social stigma]] in the United States due to a history of [[Anti-communism#United States|anti-communism in the United States]].<!--research communism in South America--> Since the early 1970s, the term [[Eurocommunism]] was used to refer to the policies of Communist parties in [[western Europe]], which sought to break with the tradition of uncritical and unconditional support of the Soviet Union. Such parties were politically active and electorally significant in France and Italy. With the collapse of the statalized [[one-party system]]s and [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] governments, in [[Eastern Europe]] from the late 1980s and the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|breakup of the Soviet Union]] on December 8, 1991, [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] state communism's influence has decreased dramatically in Europe, but around a quarter of the world's population still lives under such a kind of Communist states.\n\n==== Leninism and Marxism\u2013Leninism ====\n{{main|Leninism|Marxism\u2013Leninism}}\n[[Vladimir Lenin]] never used the term Leninism, nor did he refer to his views as Marxism\u2013Leninism. However, his ideas diverged from classical Marxist theory on several important points (see the articles on Marxism and Leninism for more information). [[Bolshevik]] communists saw these differences as advancements of Marxism made by Lenin. After Lenin's death, his ideology and contributions to Marxist theory were termed \"Marxism\u2013Leninism\", or sometimes only \"Leninism\". Marxism\u2013Leninism soon became the official name for the ideology of the [[Comintern]] and of [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] around the world.\n\n==== Stalinism ====\n{{main|Stalinism}}\nStalinism was the theory and practice of [[communism]] practiced by [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the Soviet Union from 1928\u20131953. Officially it adhered to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], but whether Stalin's practices actually followed the principles of Marx and Lenin is a subject of debate and [[Anti-Stalinist left|criticism]]. In contrast to Marx and Lenin, Stalin made few new theoretical contributions. Stalin's main contributions to communist theory were ''[[Socialism in One Country]]'' and the theory of [[Aggravation of class struggle under socialism]], a theoretical base supporting the repression of political opponents as necessary. Stalinism took an aggressive stance on [[class conflict]], utilizing [[state violence]] in an attempt to forcibly purge society of the [[bourgeoisie]].<ref>Stephen Kotkin.

Even when the [[proletariat]] has seized state power through a socialist [[revolution]], the potential remains for a [[bourgeoisie]] to restore capitalism. Indeed, Mao famously stated that \"the bourgeoisie [in a socialist country] is right inside the Communist Party itself\", implying that corrupt Party officials would subvert socialism if not prevented.\n\nUnlike the earlier forms of Marxism-Leninism in which the urban [[proletariat]] was seen as the main source of revolution, and the countryside was largely ignored, Mao focused on the peasantry as a revolutionary force which, he said, could be mobilized by a Communist Party with their knowledge and leadership.\n\nUnlike most other political ideologies, including other [[socialist]] and Marxist ones, Maoism contains an integral [[military]] doctrine and explicitly connects its political ideology with [[military strategy]]. In Maoist thought, \"political power comes from the barrel of the gun\" (one of Mao's quotes), and the [[peasantry]] can be mobilized to undertake a \"[[people's war]]\" of armed struggle involving [[guerrilla warfare]].\n\nSince the death of Mao and the reforms of Deng, most of the parties explicitly defining themselves as \"Maoist\" have disappeared, but various communist groups around the world, particularly armed ones like the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)|CPI (Maoist)]] and [[Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist)|CPI (ML)]] of India and the [[New People's Army]] of the [[Philippines]], continue to advance Maoist ideas and get press attention for them. These groups generally have the idea that Mao's ideas were betrayed before they could be fully or properly implemented.\n\n==== Trotskyism ====\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\nTrotskyism is the theory of Marxism as advocated by [[Leon Trotsky]].  Trotsky considered himself a [[Bolshevik]]\u2013[[Leninism|Leninist]], arguing for the establishment of a [[vanguard party]].  He considered himself an advocate of orthodox Marxism.  His politics differed greatly from those of [[Stalinism|Stalin]] or [[Maoism|Mao]], most importantly in declaring the need for an international \"[[permanent revolution]]\" and arguing that democracy is essential to both socialism and communism. Numerous groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyist and see themselves as standing in this tradition, although they have diverse interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this.\n\n==== Council communism and left communism ====\n{{main|Council communism|Left communism}}\nCouncil communism, or councilism, is a current of [[libertarian Marxism]] that emerged from the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|November Revolution]] in the 1920s, characterized by its opposition to [[state capitalism]]/[[state socialism]] as well as its advocacy of [[workers' councils]] as the basis for [[Socialist state|workers' democracy]]. Originally affiliated with the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD), council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within the greater [[libertarian socialism]] movement.\n\nChief among the tenets of council communism is its opposition to the [[Vanguard party|party vanguardism]]<ref name=\"Pannekoek36\">[[Anton Pannekoek]] (1936) [http://libcom.org/library/workers-councils-book-pannekoek ''Workers\u2019 Councils'']</ref><ref>[http://libcom.org/library/notes-trotsky-pannekoek-bordiga-gilles-dauv%C3%A9 ''Notes on Trotsky, Pannekoek, Bordiga \u2013 Gilles Dauv\u00e9'']</ref> and [[democratic centralism]]<ref>Pannekoek, Anton. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1936/dictatorship.htm State Capitalism and Dictatorship] International Council Correspondence, Vol.III, No.1, January 1937.</ref> of [[Leninism|Leninist ideologies]] and its contention that democratic workers' councils arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organization and authority. Council communism also stands in contrast to [[social democracy]] through its formal rejection of both the [[reformism]] and [[parliamentarism]].<ref>Ruhle, Otto. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/ruhle/1920/ruhle02.htm \"The Revolution Is Not A Party Affair\".] 1920.</ref>\n\nThe historical origins of left communism can be traced to the period before [[World War I]], but it only came into focus after 1918. All left communists were supportive of the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, but retained a critical view of its development. However, some would in later years come to reject the idea that the revolution had a [[proletarian]] or [[socialist]] nature, asserting that it had simply carried out the tasks of the [[bourgeois]] revolution by creating a state capitalist system.\n\n==== Autonomism ====\n{{main|Autonomism}}\n[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Antonio Negri]], main theorist of [[Autonomism#Italian autonomism|Italian autonomism]]]]\nAutonomism refers to a set of [[left-wing]] political and social movements and theories close to the [[socialism|socialist movement]]. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Later, post-[[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian [[far-left]] movements in the 1970s, and the emergence of a number of important theorists including [[Antonio Negri]], who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'', Mario Tronti, [[Paolo Virno]], etc.\n\nUnlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a \"bottom up\" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working, and socialization in the workplace.\n\nThrough translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson-Forest Tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]].\n\nIt influenced the German and Dutch Autonomen, the worldwide [[Social Centre movement]], and today is influential in Italy, France, and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] and anarchists. The Autonomist Marxist and ''Autonomen'' movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as ''Autonomists''.\n\nThe Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright, and [[Nick Dyer-Witheford]].\n\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{main|Anarchism}}\nAnarchism is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[stateless society|stateless societies]] based on non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]]s.<ref name=\"iaf-ifa.org\"/><ref>\"That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organization and preaches free agreement \u2014 at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist.\" [[Peter Kropotkin]].

Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). The [[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica|Spanish Workers Federation]] in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910.

Furthermore, it means that, within capitalism, any gains or losses made by some workers from or to bosses will eventually affect all workers. Therefore, all workers must support one another in their [[class conflict]] to [[Wiktionary:Liberate|liberate]] themselves.\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]]\u2014that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position\u2014will allow workers to liberate themselves.<ref>Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73</ref> Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or \"business agents\"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.\n\n[[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet ''[[Anarcho-Syndicalism (book)|Anarcho-Syndicalism]]''. The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries.

Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862), uno de los escritores pr\u00f3ximos al movimiento de la filosof\u00eda trascendentalista, es uno de los m\u00e1s conocidos. Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan.

He thought that the \"labouring classes are deprived of their earnings by usury in its three forms, interest, rent and profit\", therefore \"''[[Liberty (1881\u20131908)|Liberty]]'' will abolish interest; it will abolish profit; it will abolish monopolistic rent; it will abolish taxation; it will abolish the exploitation of labour; it will abolish all means whereby any labourer can be deprived of any of his product\".

Later, in De Profundis, he described Kropotkin's life as one \"of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience\" and talked of him as \"a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia.\" But in The Soul of Man Under Socialism, which appeared in 1890, it is [[William Godwin|Godwin]] rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant.\" George Woodcock.

(p. 447)</ref> In a socialist society, people will have the possibility to realise their talents as \"each member of the society will share in the general prosperity and happiness of the society\". Wilde added that \"upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism\" since individuals will no longer need to fear poverty or starvation. This individualism would, in turn, protect against governments \"armed with economic power as they are now with political power\" over their citizens. However, Wilde advocated non-capitalist individualism, saying that \"of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type\" a critique which is \"quite true\".<ref name=\"The Soul of Man\">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/soul-of-man-under-socialism-oscar-wilde |title=The Soul of Man |publisher=Libcom.org |date=2005-09-08 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}</ref> In Wilde's imagination, in this way socialism would free men from manual labour and allow them to devote their time to creative pursuits, thus developing their soul. He ended by declaring: \"The new individualism is the new hellenism\".<ref name=\"The Soul of Man\"/>\n\n=== Social democracy ===\n{{main|Social democracy}}\nSocial democracy can be divided into classic and modern strands. Classic social democracy was a political philosophy that attempted to achieve socialism through gradual, parliamentary means and by reforming capitalism from within rather than through revolutionary means.  The term ''social democracy'' can refer to the particular kind of society that social democrats advocate.\n\nThe [[Socialist International]] (SI), the worldwide organization of social democratic and democratic socialist parties, defines social democracy as an ideal form of [[representative democracy]] that may solve the problems found in a [[liberal democracy]]. The SI emphasizes the following principles: firstly, ''freedom''\u2014not only individual liberties, but also freedom from discrimination and freedom from dependence on either the owners of the means of production or the holders of abusive political power. Secondly, ''equality and social justice''\u2014not only before the law but also economic and socio-cultural equality as well, and equal opportunities for all including those with physical, mental, or social disabilities. Finally, ''solidarity''\u2014unity and a sense of compassion for the victims of injustice and inequality.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080222070726/http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html \"Declaration of Principles\"]. Socialist International.</ref>\n\nSocial democracy seeks to contain capitalism through transitioning unstable private sector enterprises into public ownership, correcting economic and social inequality through social safety nets and services (sometimes referred to as [[welfare state]] policies) and more aggressive regulation of markets and private enterprise than other forms of [[mixed economy]]. Over the past forty years, social democracy has increasingly been replaced with alternate economic systems such as the [[social market economy]] or [[Third Way]] mixed economies that are informed by [[Keynesian economics]].\n\n=== Democratic socialism ===\n{{main|Democratic socialism}}\nModern [[democratic socialism]] is a broad political movement that seeks to propagate the ideals of socialism within the context of a democratic system. Democratic socialism is closely related to social democracy and in some accounts are identical while other accounts stress differences.  Many democratic socialists support social democracy as a road to reform of the current system while others support more revolutionary change in society to establish socialist goals. Generally, social democracy is considered to be more centrist and broadly supportive of current capitalist systems (for example, the [[mixed economy]]) and the [[welfare state]] while many democratic socialists support a more fully socialist system, either through [[evolutionary socialism|evolutionary]] or [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] means.\n\nDemocratic socialists and social democrats both advocate the concept of the [[welfare state]], but whereas most social democrats view the welfare state as the end itself, irrespective of any hierarchies of power that may persist following welfare reforms, many democratic socialists view it as the means to an egalitarian end. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Highlighting this difference, contemporary advocates of the democratic socialist model have criticized the social democratic approach of a welfare state if it is not adequately providing socioeconomic welfare programs at the universal level. <ref name=\"Day\">{{cite web|last=Day|first=Meagan|title=Why We Need Free College for Everyone \u2014 Even Rich People|work=Jacobin Magazine (July, 2019)|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/07/free-college-tuition-bernie-sanders-means-testing-universal-social-programs|quote=Where a meager means-tested welfare-state model breeds alienation and competition, a robust universal welfare-state model breeds trust and cooperation.

Members of several major religions have found that their beliefs about human society fit with socialist principles and ideas. As a result, religious socialist movements have developed within these religions.\n\n==== Christian socialism ====\n{{main|Christian socialism}}\n{{further|Christian left|Social Gospel}}\nThere are individuals and groups, past and present, that are clearly both Christian and socialist, such as [[Frederick Denison Maurice]], author of ''The Kingdom of Christ'' (1838), and the [[Christian Socialist Movement]] (UK) (CSM), affiliated with the British [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. [[Distributism]], is a [[Third Way (centrism)|third-way]] economic philosophy formulated by such Catholic thinkers as [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]] to apply the principles of [[social justice]] articulated by the Roman Catholic Church, especially in Pope [[Leo XIII]]'s encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]''.\n\nVarious [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] clerical parties have at times referred to themselves as \"Christian Social.\" Two examples are the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] of [[Karl Lueger]] in Austria before and after World War I, and the contemporary [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]]. Yet these parties have never espoused socialist policies and have always stood at the conservative side of [[Christian Democracy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialdemocraticpartyofamerica.org/politicalspectrum.htm|title=Political Spectrum as seen by the Social Democratic Party of America|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] of [[Venezuela]] was an advocate of a form of Christian socialism as he claims that [[Jesus Christ]] was a socialist.\n\n==== Christian anarchism ====\n{{main|Christian anarchism}}\n[[File:L.N.Tolstoy Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Leo Tolstoy]]]]\nChristian anarchism is a [[Christian movement|movement]] in [[political theology]] that combines [[anarchism]] and [[Christianity]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |pages=2\u20134 |url= |accessdate=|quote=Locating Christian anarchism...In political theology}}</ref> The foundation of Christian anarchism is a rejection of violence, with [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'' regarded as a key text.<ref name=CritiqueofViolence>{{cite web |first=Alexandre |last=Christoyannopoulos |url=http://www.psa.ac.uk/journals/pdf/5/2010/1338_1226.pdf |title=A Christian Anarchist Critique of Violence: From Turning the Other Cheek to a Rejection of the State |date=March 2010 |publisher=Political Studies Association |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yRpM4GdE?url=http://www.psa.ac.uk/journals/pdf/5/2010/1338_1226.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-05 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |pages=19 and 208 |url= |accessdate=|quote=Leo Tolstoy}}</ref> Tolstoy sought to separate [[Russian Orthodox Christianity]]\u2014which was merged with the [[State (polity)|state]]\u2014from what he believed was the true message of Jesus as contained in the Gospels, specifically in the [[Sermon on the Mount]].

''[[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]]'' (written by [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]) consists of three parts, namely \"The Solution of the Problem of Democracy: 'The Authority of the People'\", \"The Solution of the Economic Problem: 'Socialism'\", and \"The Social Basis of the Third Universal Theory\". The book is controversial because it completely rejects modern conceptions of [[liberal democracy]] and encourages the institution of a form of [[direct democracy]] based on popular committees. Critics charge that Qaddafi uses these committees as tools of [[autocratic]] political repression in practice.\n\nScholars have highlighted the similarities between the Islamic economic system and socialist theory. For example, both are against unearned income. [[Islam]] does allow private ownership of [[natural resource]]s and large industries which are owned collectively, or at least encouraged to be so.\n\n=== Regional socialism ===\n==== Arab socialism ====\n{{main|Arab socialism}}\nThe [[Ba'ath Party|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] rules [[Syria]] and has ruled [[Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]] based on a tradition of [[secular]], non-Marxist socialism. Ba'thist beliefs combine [[Arab socialism]], [[nationalism]], and [[pan-Arabism]]. The mostly secular ideology often contrasts with that of other Arab governments in the Middle East, which sometimes lean towards [[Islamism]] and [[theocracy]]. The Ba'athists have persecuted socialists in their own countries. In Iraq, the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] assisted Iraq with a list of communists to eliminate, effectively wiping them out. Socialist Lynn Walsh argues that the Iraqi Ba'athists promoted capitalists from within the party and outside the country.<ref>Walsh, Lynn. ''Imperialism and the gulf war'', [http://www.socialistworld.net/publications/gulfcrisis/c5.html Chapter 5], 1990-91.</ref>\n\n==== Irish republican socialism ====\nSocialism has traditionally been part of the [[Irish republican]] movement since the early 20th century, when [[James Connolly]], an Irish [[Marxist]] theorist, took part in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916.  Today, most Irish nationalist and Republican organizations located in [[Northern Ireland]] advocate some form of socialism, both Marxist and non-Marxist.  The [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] which until recently was the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland promotes social democracy while militant Republican parties such as [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]] all promote their own varieties of democratic socialism intended to re-distribute wealth on an all-island basis once a [[united Ireland]] has been achieved.  The [[Irish Republican Socialist Movement]], encompassing the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]] and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] as well as the defunct [[Official Irish Republican Army]] and Irish National Liberation Front are known for promoting an ideology which combines [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninism]] with traditional revolutionary militant Republicanism and is said to be the most direct fulfillment of Connolly's legacy.\n\n=== Eco-socialism ===\n{{main|Eco-socialism}}\nMerging aspects of Marxism, [[socialism]], [[environmentalism]], anarchism and [[ecology]], Eco-socialists generally believe that the capitalist system is the cause of [[social exclusion]], [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[environmental degradation]]. Eco-socialists criticise many within the [[Green movement]] for not going far enough in their critique of the current world system and for not being overtly [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]]. At the same time, Eco-socialists would blame the traditional Left for overlooking or not properly addressing ecological problems.<ref name=Babylon>Wall, D., ''Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements'', 2005</ref> Eco-socialists are [[anti-globalisation]]. [[Joel Kovel]] sees [[globalisation]] as a force driven by capitalism \u2013 in turn, the rapid [[economic growth]] encouraged by globalisation causes acute ecological crises.<ref name=Kovel>Kovel, J., ''The Enemy of Nature'', 2002</ref>\n\nEco-socialism goes beyond a criticism of the actions of large corporations and targets the inherent properties of capitalism. Such an analysis follows [[Marxism|Marx's]] theories about the contradiction between [[use value]]s and [[exchange value]]s. As [[Joel Kovel]] explains, within a market economy, goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods. As we have to keep selling to keep buying, we must persuade others to buy our goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods. Eco-socialists like Kovel stress that this contradiction has reached a destructive extent, where certain essential activities such as caring for relatives full-time and basic subsistence are unrewarded while unnecessary economic activities earn certain individuals huge fortunes.<ref name=Kovel/>\n\n[[Agrarian socialism]] is another variant of eco-socialism.\n\n==== Green anarchism ====\n{{main|Green anarchism}}\nGreen anarchism, or eco-anarchism, is a school of thought within [[anarchism]] which puts a particular emphasis on [[environmental issues]]. An important early influence was the thought of the American [[individualist anarchist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] and his book ''[[Walden]]''.<ref name=\"Thoreau\">\"Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html \"LA INSUMISI\u00d3N VOLUNTARIA.

The party sought independence from French colonial rule in [[Vietnam]] during the early 20th century. Its origins lie in the mid-1920s, when a group of young Hanoi-based intellectuals began publishing revolutionary material. From 1928, the VNQD\u0110 attracted attention through its assassinations of French officials and Vietnamese collaborators. During the 1930s, the party was eclipsed by [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s [[Indochinese Communist Party]] (ICP). Vietnam was occupied by [[Imperial Japan|Japan]] during World War II and in the chaos that followed the Japanese surrender in 1945 the VNQD\u0110 and the ICP briefly joined forces in the fight for Vietnamese independence. After a falling out, Ho purged the VNQD\u0110, leaving his communist-dominated [[Viet Minh]] unchallenged as the foremost anti-colonial militant organisation. As a part of the post-war settlement that ended the [[First Indochina War]], Vietnam was [[Partition of Vietnam|partitioned into two zones]]. The remnants of the VNQD\u0110 fled to the anti-communist [[South Vietnam|south]], where they remained until the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Socialism}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Anarchism]]\n* [[Anarchist economics]]\n* [[Anarchist schools of thought]]\n* [[Authoritarian socialism]]\n* [[Christian socialism]]\n* [[Communism]]\n* [[Democratic socialism]]\n* [[Ethical socialism]]\n* [[History of anarchism]]\n* [[History of communism]]\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[Labour movement]]\n* \"[[The labor problem]]\"\n* [[Left-libertarianism]]\n* [[Liberal socialism]]\n* [[Libertarianism]]\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\n* [[List of communist ideologies]]\n* [[Market socialism]]\n* [[Marxian economics]]\n* [[Marxism]]\n* [[Marxist schools of thought]]\n* [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]\n* [[Reformism]]\n* [[Revolutionary socialism]]\n* [[Social democracy]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Socialist economics]]\n* [[Socialist mode of production]]\n* [[Socialist state]]\n* [[State socialism]]\n* [[Syndicalism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* G.

[...] Exchange-value, prices and so money are goals in themselves in a capitalist society or in any market. There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare. Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology. [...] It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality. [...] Although money, and so monetary calculation, will disappear in socialism this does not mean that there will no longer be any need to make choices, evaluations and calculations. [...] Wealth will be produced and distributed in its natural form of useful things, of objects that can serve to satisfy some human need or other.

For example, [[Alexandre Vinet]], who claimed to have been the first person to use the term, defined socialism simply as \"the opposite of [[individualism]]\".<ref>Cort, John C. ''\"Christian socialism\"''. Orbis Books, New York, 1988. pp. 355.</ref> [[Robert Owen]] also viewed socialism as a matter of ethics, although he used it with a slightly more specific meaning to refer to the view that human society can and should be improved for the benefit of all. In a similar vein, [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] claimed that socialism is \"every aspiration towards the amelioration of society\".<ref>Boyle, James. ''\"What is Socialism?\"'', The Shakespeare Press, 1912. pp. 35.</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, many writers who described themselves as socialists\u2014and who would be later called [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]]\u2014wrote down descriptions of what they believed to be the ideal human society. Some of them also created small communities that put their ideals into practice. A constant feature of these ideal societies was social and economic [[egalitarianism|equality]]. Because the people who proposed the creation of such societies called themselves socialists, the term socialism came to refer not only to a certain moral doctrine, but also to a type of egalitarian society based on such a doctrine.\n\nOther early advocates of socialism took a more scientific approach by favouring social leveling to create a [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] society based upon freedom for individual talent to prosper,<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|website=www.fsmitha.com}}</ref> such as Count [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and believed a socialist society would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/|title=Welcome to the School of Politics &amp; International Relations|first1=Head of|last1=School|last2=admin.spirsocy@anu.edu.au|website=School of Politics & International Relations}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of this early socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref name=\"SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction\">''Newman, Michael''. (2005) ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}</ref> Simon's ideas provided a foundation for scientific economic planning and technocratic administration of society.\n\nOther early socialist thinkers such as [[Charles Hall (economist)|Charles Hall]] and [[Thomas Hodgskin]] based their ideas on [[David Ricardo]]'s economic theories. They reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated to prices charged by the producer when those commodities were in elastic supply and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labor&mdash;the cost of the labor (essentially the wages paid) that was required to produce the commodities. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712235906/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |archivedate=2015-07-12 }}</ref> These ideas embodied early conceptions of [[market socialism]].\n\nAfter the advent of [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Marxian economics|theory of capitalism]] and [[scientific socialism]], socialism came to refer to ownership and administration of the [[means of production]] by the working class, either through the state apparatus or through independent cooperatives. In [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, socialism refers to a specific stage of social and economic development that will displace capitalism, characterized by coordinated production, public or cooperative ownership of capital, diminishing class conflict and inequalities that spawn from such and the end of wage-labor with a method of compensation based on the principle of \"[[To each according to his contribution|From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economictheories.org/2008/07/karl-marx-socialism-and-scientific.html|title=Karl Marx Socialism and Scientific Communism|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Differences between various schools ==\nAlthough they share a common root (as elaborated upon in the above sections), schools of socialism are divided on many issues and sometimes there is a split within a school. The following is a brief overview of the major issues which have generated or are generating significant controversy amongst socialists in general.\n\n=== Theory ===\nSome branches of socialism arose largely as a philosophical construct (e.g. [[utopian socialism]])\u2014others in the heat of a revolution (e.g. [[Classical Marxism|early Marxism]] or [[Leninism]]). A few arose merely as the product of a ruling party (e.g. [[Stalinism]]), other as a product or various worker movements (e.g. [[anarcho-syndicalism]]), or a party or other group contending for political power in a democratic society (e.g. [[social democracy]]).\n\nSome are in favour of a socialist revolution (e.g. [[Maoism]], [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], [[revolutionary socialism]], [[social anarchism]] and [[Trotskyism]]) whilst others tend to support [[Reformism|reform]] instead (e.g. [[Fabianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]]). Others believe both are possible (e.g. [[syndicalism]] or various forms of [[Marxism]]). The first utopian socialists even failed to address the question of how a socialist society would be achieved, upholding the belief that technology was a necessity for a socialist society and that they themselves had no comprehension of the technology of the future.{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2016}}\n\nSocialists are also divided on which rights and liberties are desirable such as the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] liberties (like those guaranteed by the United States [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] or the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]). Some hold that they are to be preserved (or even enhanced) in a socialist society (e.g. [[anarchism]] or [[left communism]]) whilst others believe them to be undesirable (e.g. [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]]). [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] even held different opinions at different times and some schools are divided on this issue (e.g. different strains of Trotskyism).\n\nAll socialists criticize the current system in some way. Some criticisms center on the ownership of the means of production (e.g. Marxism) whereas others tend to focus on the nature of mass and equitable distribution (e.g. most forms of utopian socialism). Most are opposed to unchecked industrialism as well as capitalism (e.g. [[green left]]) and believe that under socialism the environment must be protected. Utopian socialists like [[Robert Owen]] and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] argued, although not from exactly the same perspective, that the injustice and widespread poverty of the societies they lived in were a problem of distribution of the goods created. On the other hand, Marxian socialists determined that the root of the injustice is based not in the function of distribution of goods already created, but rather in the fact that the ownership of the means of production is in the hands of the upper class. Marxian socialists also maintain in contrast to the utopian socialists that the root of injustice is not in how goods ([[commodity|commodities]]) are distributed, but for whose economic benefit are they produced and sold.\n\n=== Practice ===\nMost forms and derivatives of Marxism and anarchism advocated total or near-total socialization of the economy. Less radical schools (e.g. [[Bernsteinism]], [[reformism]] and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|reformist Marxism]]) proposed a mixed market economy instead. [[Mixed economy|Mixed economies]] can in turn range anywhere from those developed by the social democratic governments that have periodically governed Northern and Western European countries, to the inclusion of small [[cooperative]]s in the planned economy of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. A related issue is whether it is better to reform capitalism to create a fairer society (e.g. most social democrats) or to totally overthrow the capitalist system (all Marxists).\n\nSome schools advocate centralized state control of the socialized sectors of the economy (e.g. Leninism), whilst others argue for control of those sectors by [[workers' council]]s (e.g. [[anarcho-communism]], [[council communism]], left communism, Marxism or [[syndicalism]]). This question is usually referred to by socialists in terms of \"ownership of the [[means of production]]\". None of the social democratic parties of Europe advocate total state ownership of the means of production in their contemporary demands and popular press.\n\nAnother issue socialists are divided on is what legal and political apparatus the workers would maintain and further develop the socialization of the means of production. Some advocate that the power of the workers' councils should itself constitute the basis of a socialist state (coupled with [[direct democracy]] and the widespread use of [[referendum]]s), but others hold that socialism entails the existence of a legislative body administered by people who would be elected in a [[representative democracy]].\n\nDifferent ideologies support different governments. During the era of the Soviet Union, Western socialists were bitterly divided as to whether the Soviet Union was actually socialist, moving toward socialism, or inherently unsocialist and in fact inimical to true socialism. Similarly, today the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] claims to be socialist and refers to its own approach as [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]], but most other socialists consider China to be essentially capitalist. The Chinese leadership concurs with most of the usual [[#Opposition and criticisms of socialism|critiques against a command economy]] and many of their actions to manage what they call a socialist economy have been determined by this opinion.\n\n== Socialist planned economy ==\nThis form of socialism combines public ownership and management of the means of production with [[Planned economy|centralized state planning]] and can refer to a broad range of economic systems from the centralized [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet-style command economy]] to participatory planning via workplace democracy. In a centrally-planned economy decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced as well as the allocation of output (distribution of goods and services) are planned in advanced by a planning agency. This type of economic system was often combined with a one-party political system and is associated with the [[Communist state]]s of the 20th century.\n\n=== State-directed economy ===\nA state-directed economy is a system where either the state or [[worker cooperative]]s own the means of production, but economic activity is directed to some degree by a government agency or planning ministry through mechanisms such as [[indicative planning]] or dirigisme. This differs from a centralized planned economy, or a command economy, in that micro-economic decision making, such as quantity to be produced and output requirements, is left to managers and workers in state enterprises or cooperative enterprises rather than being mandated by a comprehensive economic plan from a centralized planning board. However, the state will plan long-term strategic investment and some aspect of production. It is possible for a state-directed economy to have elements of both a market and planned economy. For example, production and investment decisions may be semi-planned by the state, but distribution of output may be determined by the market mechanism.\n\nState-directed socialism can also refer to technocratic socialism\u2014economic systems that rely on technocratic management and technocratic planning mechanisms, along with public ownership of the means of production. A forerunner of this concept was [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who understood the state would undergo a transformation in a socialist system and change its role from one of \"political administration of men, to the administration of things\".\n\nElements of state-directed socialist economies include [[dirigisme]], [[economic planning]], [[state socialism]] and [[technocracy]].\n\n=== Decentralized planned economy ===\nA decentralized planned economy is one where ownership of enterprises is accomplished through various forms of [[Socialism#Self-managed economy|self-management]] and worker cooperatives in which planning of production and distribution is done from the bottom-up by local worker councils in a democratic manner. This form of socialist economy is related to the political philosophies of [[libertarian socialism]], [[syndicalism]] and various forms of communal utopian socialism.\n\nExamples of decentralized democratic planning include [[council communism]], [[individualist anarchism]], [[industrial democracy]], [[participatory economics]], [[Soviet democracy]] and [[syndicalism]].<ref name=\"Graham-2005\"/>\n\n== Market socialism ==\n{{main|Market socialism}}\nMarket socialism refers to various economic systems that involve either public ownership and management or worker cooperative ownership over the means of production, or a combination of both, and the market mechanism for allocating economic output, deciding what to produce and in what quantity. In state-oriented forms of market socialism where state enterprises attempt to maximize profit, the profits can fund government programs and services eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems.\n\nSome forms of market socialism are based on [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic theory]], with the aim of attaining [[pareto efficiency]] by setting price to equal marginal cost in public enterprises. This form of socialism was promoted by [[Oskar Lange]], [[Abba Lerner]] and Fredrick Taylor. Other forms of market socialism are based on [[classical economics]], such as those advocated by [[Thomas Hodgskin]], who viewed interest accumulation, rent and profit as deductions from exchange-value, so that eliminating the capitalist element from the economy would lead to a free market and socialism. The term market socialism has also been applied to planned economic systems that try to organize themselves partially along market-lines while retaining centralized state ownership of capital.\n\nExamples of market socialism include [[economic democracy]], the [[Lange model]], [[liberal socialism]], [[market-oriented left-libertarianism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] the [[New Economic Mechanism]] and [[Ricardian socialism]]. Other types of market socialist systems such as mutualism are related to the political philosophy of [[libertarian socialism]].\n\n=== Socialist market economy ===\nA socialist market economy refers to the economic systems adopted by the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]. Although there is dispute as to whether or not these models actually constitute [[state capitalism]], the decisive means of production remain under state-ownership. State enterprises are organized into corporations ([[corporatization]]) and operate like private capitalist enterprises. A substantial private sector exists alongside the state sector of the economy, but it plays a secondary role usually relegated to the service sector and production of consumer goods.\n\nExamples of socialist market economies include the [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics]] and the [[socialist-oriented market economy]].\n\n== Socialist ideologies ==\n=== Utopian socialism ===\n{{main|Utopian socialism}}\n[[File:Hw-fourier.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Charles Fourier]], influential French early socialist]]\nUtopian socialism is  a term used to define the first currents of modern [[Socialism|socialist]] thought as exemplified by the work of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]], which inspired [[Karl Marx]] and other early socialists.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/synopsis.html| title=Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism| publisher=Public Broadcasting System| accessdate=December 15, 2011}}</ref> However, visions of imaginary ideal societies, which competed with revolutionary social democratic movements, were viewed as not being grounded in the material conditions of society and as \"reactionary\".<ref name=Draper>{{cite book |last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution, Volume IV: Critique of Other Socialisms|year=1990|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-85345-798-5|pages=1\u201321}}</ref> Although it is technically possible for any set of ideas or any person living at any time in history to be a utopian socialist, the term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label \"utopian\" by later socialists as a negative term, in order to imply naivete and dismiss their ideas as fanciful or unrealistic.<ref name=\"SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction\"/> Forms of socialism which existed in traditional societies are referred to as [[primitive communism]] by Marxists.\n\nReligious sects whose members live communally, such as the [[Hutterites]], for example, are not usually called \"utopian socialists\", although their way of living is a prime example. They have been categorized as [[religious socialism|religious socialists]] by some. Likewise, modern [[intentional communities]] based on socialist ideas could also be categorized as \"utopian socialist\".\n\n=== Marxism ===\n{{main|Communism|Marxism}}\n[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Karl Marx]] (1818\u20131883)]]\nMarxism, or Marxist communism, refers to [[Classless society|classless]], [[Stateless society|stateless]] social organization based upon [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and to a variety of movements acting in the name of this goal which are influenced by the thought of Karl Marx. In general, the classless forms of social organisation are not capitalised, while movements associated with official [[communist parties]] and [[Communist states]] usually are. In the classic Marxist definition ([[pure communism]]), a communist economy refers to a system that has achieved a superabundance of goods and services due to an increase in technological capability and advances in the productive forces and therefore has transcended socialism  (see [[post-scarcity economy]]). This is a hypothetical stage of social and economic development with few speculative details known about it.\n\nThe actual goal of communism has never been attained in practice from a Marxist position, though anarchist societies have provided a glimpse of what a communist world would look like. The real idea behind it is to abolish all leadership, and govern with a [[commune]]. That is, the people themselves make all decisions, and everyone contributing to the wellbeing of the [[State (polity)|commune]]. In practice, most governments that have claimed to be communist have been [[totalitarian]] [[dictatorships]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe modern political marxist communist movement was created when the social democratic parties of Europe split between their rightist and leftist tendencies during World War I.  The leftists, led internationally by [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]], to distinguish their brand of socialism from the \"[[reformist]]\" social democrats, were called \"communists\".  However, after Luxemburg's and Liebknecht's murders the term communist became generally associated solely with the parties and organisations following Lenin, along with their various derivations, such as [[Stalinism]] or [[Maoism]].\n\nThere is a considerable variety of views among self-identified communists. However, [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]], [[school (discipline)|schools]] of communism associated with Karl Marx and of Vladimir Lenin respectively, have the distinction of having been a major force in world politics since the early 20th century. [[Class struggle]] plays a central role in Marxism. This theory views the formation of communism as the culmination of the class struggle between the capitalist class, the owners of most of the capital and the working class. Marx held that society could not be transformed from the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] to the communist mode of production all at once, but required a transitional state which Marx described as the revolutionary [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].\n\nSome forms of the communist society that Marx envisioned, as emerging from capitalism, have been claimed to be achieved for limited periods during certain historical moments and under certain circumstances. For example, the [[Paris Commune]] in fact let Marx reinforce and implement his theories by adapting them to a real experience he could draw from. Another similar case, though disputed by [[anarcho-syndicalism]] or even [[anarchism]], was the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] of 1936 (often missed or unmentioned by official [[historiography]]), during which much of Spain's economy in most of [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] areas, some of which enjoyed a practical absence of [[State (polity)|state]], was put under workers' direct collective control.\n\nIn addition to this, the term communism (as well as socialism) is often used to refer to those political and economic systems and states dominated by a political, bureaucratic class, typically attached to one [[One-party state|single]] [[Communist party]] that follow Marxist-Leninist doctrines and often claim to represent the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in a non-democratic fashion, described by critics as in a [[totalitarian]] and [[bureaucratic]]. These systems are also often called Stalinism, [[state capitalism]], [[state communism]] or [[state socialism]].\n\nWith the Soviet Union's creation after the end of [[Russian Civil War]] that followed to initial success of Red [[October Revolution]] in Russia, other socialist parties in other countries and the [[Bolshevik party]] itself became Communist parties, owing allegiance of varying degrees to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (see [[Communist International]]). After World War II, regimes calling themselves Communist took power in Eastern Europe. In 1949, the Communists in China, supported by Soviet Union and led by [[Mao Zedong]], came to power and established the [[People's Republic of China]]. Among the other countries in the [[Third World]] that adopted a bureaucratic [[Communist state]] as form of government at some point were Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Angola and Mozambique. By the early 1980s, almost one third of the world's population lived under Communist states.\n\nCommunism carries a strong [[social stigma]] in the United States due to a history of [[Anti-communism#United States|anti-communism in the United States]].<!--research communism in South America--> Since the early 1970s, the term [[Eurocommunism]] was used to refer to the policies of Communist parties in [[western Europe]], which sought to break with the tradition of uncritical and unconditional support of the Soviet Union. Such parties were politically active and electorally significant in France and Italy. With the collapse of the statalized [[one-party system]]s and [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] governments, in [[Eastern Europe]] from the late 1980s and the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|breakup of the Soviet Union]] on December 8, 1991, [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] state communism's influence has decreased dramatically in Europe, but around a quarter of the world's population still lives under such a kind of Communist states.\n\n==== Leninism and Marxism\u2013Leninism ====\n{{main|Leninism|Marxism\u2013Leninism}}\n[[Vladimir Lenin]] never used the term Leninism, nor did he refer to his views as Marxism\u2013Leninism. However, his ideas diverged from classical Marxist theory on several important points (see the articles on Marxism and Leninism for more information). [[Bolshevik]] communists saw these differences as advancements of Marxism made by Lenin. After Lenin's death, his ideology and contributions to Marxist theory were termed \"Marxism\u2013Leninism\", or sometimes only \"Leninism\". Marxism\u2013Leninism soon became the official name for the ideology of the [[Comintern]] and of [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] around the world.\n\n==== Stalinism ====\n{{main|Stalinism}}\nStalinism was the theory and practice of [[communism]] practiced by [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the Soviet Union from 1928\u20131953. Officially it adhered to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], but whether Stalin's practices actually followed the principles of Marx and Lenin is a subject of debate and [[Anti-Stalinist left|criticism]]. In contrast to Marx and Lenin, Stalin made few new theoretical contributions. Stalin's main contributions to communist theory were ''[[Socialism in One Country]]'' and the theory of [[Aggravation of class struggle under socialism]], a theoretical base supporting the repression of political opponents as necessary. Stalinism took an aggressive stance on [[class conflict]], utilizing [[state violence]] in an attempt to forcibly purge society of the [[bourgeoisie]].<ref>Stephen Kotkin.

Indeed, Mao famously stated that \"the bourgeoisie [in a socialist country] is right inside the Communist Party itself\", implying that corrupt Party officials would subvert socialism if not prevented.\n\nUnlike the earlier forms of Marxism-Leninism in which the urban [[proletariat]] was seen as the main source of revolution, and the countryside was largely ignored, Mao focused on the peasantry as a revolutionary force which, he said, could be mobilized by a Communist Party with their knowledge and leadership.\n\nUnlike most other political ideologies, including other [[socialist]] and Marxist ones, Maoism contains an integral [[military]] doctrine and explicitly connects its political ideology with [[military strategy]]. In Maoist thought, \"political power comes from the barrel of the gun\" (one of Mao's quotes), and the [[peasantry]] can be mobilized to undertake a \"[[people's war]]\" of armed struggle involving [[guerrilla warfare]].\n\nSince the death of Mao and the reforms of Deng, most of the parties explicitly defining themselves as \"Maoist\" have disappeared, but various communist groups around the world, particularly armed ones like the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)|CPI (Maoist)]] and [[Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist)|CPI (ML)]] of India and the [[New People's Army]] of the [[Philippines]], continue to advance Maoist ideas and get press attention for them. These groups generally have the idea that Mao's ideas were betrayed before they could be fully or properly implemented.\n\n==== Trotskyism ====\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\nTrotskyism is the theory of Marxism as advocated by [[Leon Trotsky]].  Trotsky considered himself a [[Bolshevik]]\u2013[[Leninism|Leninist]], arguing for the establishment of a [[vanguard party]].  He considered himself an advocate of orthodox Marxism.  His politics differed greatly from those of [[Stalinism|Stalin]] or [[Maoism|Mao]], most importantly in declaring the need for an international \"[[permanent revolution]]\" and arguing that democracy is essential to both socialism and communism. Numerous groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyist and see themselves as standing in this tradition, although they have diverse interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this.\n\n==== Council communism and left communism ====\n{{main|Council communism|Left communism}}\nCouncil communism, or councilism, is a current of [[libertarian Marxism]] that emerged from the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|November Revolution]] in the 1920s, characterized by its opposition to [[state capitalism]]/[[state socialism]] as well as its advocacy of [[workers' councils]] as the basis for [[Socialist state|workers' democracy]]. Originally affiliated with the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD), council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within the greater [[libertarian socialism]] movement.\n\nChief among the tenets of council communism is its opposition to the [[Vanguard party|party vanguardism]]<ref name=\"Pannekoek36\">[[Anton Pannekoek]] (1936) [http://libcom.org/library/workers-councils-book-pannekoek ''Workers\u2019 Councils'']</ref><ref>[http://libcom.org/library/notes-trotsky-pannekoek-bordiga-gilles-dauv%C3%A9 ''Notes on Trotsky, Pannekoek, Bordiga \u2013 Gilles Dauv\u00e9'']</ref> and [[democratic centralism]]<ref>Pannekoek, Anton. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1936/dictatorship.htm State Capitalism and Dictatorship] International Council Correspondence, Vol.III, No.1, January 1937.</ref> of [[Leninism|Leninist ideologies]] and its contention that democratic workers' councils arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organization and authority. Council communism also stands in contrast to [[social democracy]] through its formal rejection of both the [[reformism]] and [[parliamentarism]].<ref>Ruhle, Otto. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/ruhle/1920/ruhle02.htm \"The Revolution Is Not A Party Affair\".] 1920.</ref>\n\nThe historical origins of left communism can be traced to the period before [[World War I]], but it only came into focus after 1918. All left communists were supportive of the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, but retained a critical view of its development. However, some would in later years come to reject the idea that the revolution had a [[proletarian]] or [[socialist]] nature, asserting that it had simply carried out the tasks of the [[bourgeois]] revolution by creating a state capitalist system.\n\n==== Autonomism ====\n{{main|Autonomism}}\n[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Antonio Negri]], main theorist of [[Autonomism#Italian autonomism|Italian autonomism]]]]\nAutonomism refers to a set of [[left-wing]] political and social movements and theories close to the [[socialism|socialist movement]]. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Later, post-[[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian [[far-left]] movements in the 1970s, and the emergence of a number of important theorists including [[Antonio Negri]], who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'', Mario Tronti, [[Paolo Virno]], etc.\n\nUnlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a \"bottom up\" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working, and socialization in the workplace.\n\nThrough translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson-Forest Tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]].\n\nIt influenced the German and Dutch Autonomen, the worldwide [[Social Centre movement]], and today is influential in Italy, France, and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] and anarchists. The Autonomist Marxist and ''Autonomen'' movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as ''Autonomists''.\n\nThe Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright, and [[Nick Dyer-Witheford]].\n\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{main|Anarchism}}\nAnarchism is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[stateless society|stateless societies]] based on non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]]s.<ref name=\"iaf-ifa.org\"/><ref>\"That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organization and preaches free agreement \u2014 at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist.\" [[Peter Kropotkin]].

Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity.

Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). The [[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica|Spanish Workers Federation]] in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910.

Furthermore, it means that, within capitalism, any gains or losses made by some workers from or to bosses will eventually affect all workers. Therefore, all workers must support one another in their [[class conflict]] to [[Wiktionary:Liberate|liberate]] themselves.\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]]\u2014that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position\u2014will allow workers to liberate themselves.<ref>Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73</ref> Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or \"business agents\"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.\n\n[[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet ''[[Anarcho-Syndicalism (book)|Anarcho-Syndicalism]]''. The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries. The Spanish [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] played and still plays a major role in the Spanish [[labor movement]]. It was also an important force in the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\n==== Individualist anarchism ====\n{{main|Individualist anarchism}}\nIndividualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems.<ref name=\"ryner\">\"What do I mean by individualism?

Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862), uno de los escritores pr\u00f3ximos al movimiento de la filosof\u00eda trascendentalista, es uno de los m\u00e1s conocidos. Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan.

He thought that the \"labouring classes are deprived of their earnings by usury in its three forms, interest, rent and profit\", therefore \"''[[Liberty (1881\u20131908)|Liberty]]'' will abolish interest; it will abolish profit; it will abolish monopolistic rent; it will abolish taxation; it will abolish the exploitation of labour; it will abolish all means whereby any labourer can be deprived of any of his product\".

And from those easy as well as beautiful problems anarchism deals with and he who puts them in practice and lives them are anarchists.

Wilde, as we have seen, declared himself an anarchist on at least one occasion during the 1890s, and he greatly admired [[Kropotkin]], whom he had met. Later, in De Profundis, he described Kropotkin's life as one \"of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience\" and talked of him as \"a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia.\" But in The Soul of Man Under Socialism, which appeared in 1890, it is [[William Godwin|Godwin]] rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant.\" George Woodcock.

(p. 447)</ref> In a socialist society, people will have the possibility to realise their talents as \"each member of the society will share in the general prosperity and happiness of the society\". Wilde added that \"upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism\" since individuals will no longer need to fear poverty or starvation. This individualism would, in turn, protect against governments \"armed with economic power as they are now with political power\" over their citizens. However, Wilde advocated non-capitalist individualism, saying that \"of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type\" a critique which is \"quite true\".<ref name=\"The Soul of Man\">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/soul-of-man-under-socialism-oscar-wilde |title=The Soul of Man |publisher=Libcom.org |date=2005-09-08 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}</ref> In Wilde's imagination, in this way socialism would free men from manual labour and allow them to devote their time to creative pursuits, thus developing their soul. He ended by declaring: \"The new individualism is the new hellenism\".<ref name=\"The Soul of Man\"/>\n\n=== Social democracy ===\n{{main|Social democracy}}\nSocial democracy can be divided into classic and modern strands. Classic social democracy was a political philosophy that attempted to achieve socialism through gradual, parliamentary means and by reforming capitalism from within rather than through revolutionary means.  The term ''social democracy'' can refer to the particular kind of society that social democrats advocate.\n\nThe [[Socialist International]] (SI), the worldwide organization of social democratic and democratic socialist parties, defines social democracy as an ideal form of [[representative democracy]] that may solve the problems found in a [[liberal democracy]]. The SI emphasizes the following principles: firstly, ''freedom''\u2014not only individual liberties, but also freedom from discrimination and freedom from dependence on either the owners of the means of production or the holders of abusive political power. Secondly, ''equality and social justice''\u2014not only before the law but also economic and socio-cultural equality as well, and equal opportunities for all including those with physical, mental, or social disabilities. Finally, ''solidarity''\u2014unity and a sense of compassion for the victims of injustice and inequality.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080222070726/http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html \"Declaration of Principles\"]. Socialist International.</ref>\n\nSocial democracy seeks to contain capitalism through transitioning unstable private sector enterprises into public ownership, correcting economic and social inequality through social safety nets and services (sometimes referred to as [[welfare state]] policies) and more aggressive regulation of markets and private enterprise than other forms of [[mixed economy]]. Over the past forty years, social democracy has increasingly been replaced with alternate economic systems such as the [[social market economy]] or [[Third Way]] mixed economies that are informed by [[Keynesian economics]].\n\n=== Democratic socialism ===\n{{main|Democratic socialism}}\nModern [[democratic socialism]] is a broad political movement that seeks to propagate the ideals of socialism within the context of a democratic system. Democratic socialism is closely related to social democracy and in some accounts are identical while other accounts stress differences.  Many democratic socialists support social democracy as a road to reform of the current system while others support more revolutionary change in society to establish socialist goals. Generally, social democracy is considered to be more centrist and broadly supportive of current capitalist systems (for example, the [[mixed economy]]) and the [[welfare state]] while many democratic socialists support a more fully socialist system, either through [[evolutionary socialism|evolutionary]] or [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] means.\n\nDemocratic socialists and social democrats both advocate the concept of the [[welfare state]], but whereas most social democrats view the welfare state as the end itself, irrespective of any hierarchies of power that may persist following welfare reforms, many democratic socialists view it as the means to an egalitarian end. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Highlighting this difference, contemporary advocates of the democratic socialist model have criticized the social democratic approach of a welfare state if it is not adequately providing socioeconomic welfare programs at the universal level. <ref name=\"Day\">{{cite web|last=Day|first=Meagan|title=Why We Need Free College for Everyone \u2014 Even Rich People|work=Jacobin Magazine (July, 2019)|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/07/free-college-tuition-bernie-sanders-means-testing-universal-social-programs|quote=Where a meager means-tested welfare-state model breeds alienation and competition, a robust universal welfare-state model breeds trust and cooperation. These qualities are necessary to develop a foundation from which to launch other ambitious social projects, and to progress as a society.}}</ref> Democratic socialists are also committed to the ideas of the [[Property redistribution|redistribution]] of wealth and power, as well as social ownership of major industries, concepts widely abandoned by social democrats.\n\nThere are no countries in the world that would qualify as a democratic socialist state, although some states describe themselves as such, for example [[Venezuela]], whose former leader [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] claimed that democratic socialism was integral to the [[Bolivarian]] form of socialism that he was trying to promote.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sojo|first=Cleto A|title=Venezuela's Chavez Closes World Social Forum with Call to Transcend Capitalism|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/907|publisher=Venezuela analysis}}</ref>\n\n=== Liberal socialism ===\n{{main|Liberal socialism}}\nLiberal socialism is a type of [[socialism]] that includes [[Liberalism|liberal]] principles within it.<ref name=\"Gerald F.

''[[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]]'' (written by [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]) consists of three parts, namely \"The Solution of the Problem of Democracy: 'The Authority of the People'\", \"The Solution of the Economic Problem: 'Socialism'\", and \"The Social Basis of the Third Universal Theory\". The book is controversial because it completely rejects modern conceptions of [[liberal democracy]] and encourages the institution of a form of [[direct democracy]] based on popular committees. Critics charge that Qaddafi uses these committees as tools of [[autocratic]] political repression in practice.\n\nScholars have highlighted the similarities between the Islamic economic system and socialist theory. For example, both are against unearned income. [[Islam]] does allow private ownership of [[natural resource]]s and large industries which are owned collectively, or at least encouraged to be so.\n\n=== Regional socialism ===\n==== Arab socialism ====\n{{main|Arab socialism}}\nThe [[Ba'ath Party|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] rules [[Syria]] and has ruled [[Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]] based on a tradition of [[secular]], non-Marxist socialism. Ba'thist beliefs combine [[Arab socialism]], [[nationalism]], and [[pan-Arabism]]. The mostly secular ideology often contrasts with that of other Arab governments in the Middle East, which sometimes lean towards [[Islamism]] and [[theocracy]]. The Ba'athists have persecuted socialists in their own countries. In Iraq, the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] assisted Iraq with a list of communists to eliminate, effectively wiping them out. Socialist Lynn Walsh argues that the Iraqi Ba'athists promoted capitalists from within the party and outside the country.<ref>Walsh, Lynn. ''Imperialism and the gulf war'', [http://www.socialistworld.net/publications/gulfcrisis/c5.html Chapter 5], 1990-91.</ref>\n\n==== Irish republican socialism ====\nSocialism has traditionally been part of the [[Irish republican]] movement since the early 20th century, when [[James Connolly]], an Irish [[Marxist]] theorist, took part in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916.  Today, most Irish nationalist and Republican organizations located in [[Northern Ireland]] advocate some form of socialism, both Marxist and non-Marxist.  The [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] which until recently was the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland promotes social democracy while militant Republican parties such as [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]] all promote their own varieties of democratic socialism intended to re-distribute wealth on an all-island basis once a [[united Ireland]] has been achieved.  The [[Irish Republican Socialist Movement]], encompassing the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]] and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] as well as the defunct [[Official Irish Republican Army]] and Irish National Liberation Front are known for promoting an ideology which combines [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninism]] with traditional revolutionary militant Republicanism and is said to be the most direct fulfillment of Connolly's legacy.\n\n=== Eco-socialism ===\n{{main|Eco-socialism}}\nMerging aspects of Marxism, [[socialism]], [[environmentalism]], anarchism and [[ecology]], Eco-socialists generally believe that the capitalist system is the cause of [[social exclusion]], [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[environmental degradation]]. Eco-socialists criticise many within the [[Green movement]] for not going far enough in their critique of the current world system and for not being overtly [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]]. At the same time, Eco-socialists would blame the traditional Left for overlooking or not properly addressing ecological problems.<ref name=Babylon>Wall, D., ''Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements'', 2005</ref> Eco-socialists are [[anti-globalisation]]. [[Joel Kovel]] sees [[globalisation]] as a force driven by capitalism \u2013 in turn, the rapid [[economic growth]] encouraged by globalisation causes acute ecological crises.<ref name=Kovel>Kovel, J., ''The Enemy of Nature'', 2002</ref>\n\nEco-socialism goes beyond a criticism of the actions of large corporations and targets the inherent properties of capitalism. Such an analysis follows [[Marxism|Marx's]] theories about the contradiction between [[use value]]s and [[exchange value]]s. As [[Joel Kovel]] explains, within a market economy, goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods. As we have to keep selling to keep buying, we must persuade others to buy our goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods. Eco-socialists like Kovel stress that this contradiction has reached a destructive extent, where certain essential activities such as caring for relatives full-time and basic subsistence are unrewarded while unnecessary economic activities earn certain individuals huge fortunes.<ref name=Kovel/>\n\n[[Agrarian socialism]] is another variant of eco-socialism.\n\n==== Green anarchism ====\n{{main|Green anarchism}}\nGreen anarchism, or eco-anarchism, is a school of thought within [[anarchism]] which puts a particular emphasis on [[environmental issues]]. An important early influence was the thought of the American [[individualist anarchist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] and his book ''[[Walden]]''.<ref name=\"Thoreau\">\"Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html \"LA INSUMISI\u00d3N VOLUNTARIA.

The party's motto, \"Unity, Liberty, Socialism\" (''wahda, hurriya, ishtirakiya''), was inspired by the French [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] political doctrine linking national unity and social equity.<ref name='Histoire  de Saint-Just D\u00e9put\u00e9 de la Convention Nationale'>{{cite news |first=Ernest |last=Hamel |title=Histoire de Saint-Just D\u00e9put\u00e9 de la Convention Nationale |year=1859 |publisher=Impr. et Librairie Poulet-Malassis et Broise}}</ref> In the slogan, \"unity\" refers to Arab unity, \"liberty\" emphasizes being free from foreign control and interference, and \"socialism\" refers to [[Arab socialism]], not European-style [[Marxism]] or [[communism]].\n\nThe party was founded in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]] in 1940 by the Syrian intellectuals [[Michel Aflaq]] and [[Salah al-Bitar]], and since its inception, it has established branches in different Arab countries, although the only countries it has ever held power in are Syria and [[Iraq]]. Aflaq and al-Bitar both studied at the [[Sorbonne]] in the early 1930s, at a time when [[centre-left]] [[Positivism]] was still the dominant ideology amongst France's academic elite. The Ba'ath party included a significant number of [[Christian Arabs]] among its founding members. For them, a resolutely nationalist and secular political framework was a suitable way to avoid a faith-based Islamic orientation and to give non-Muslims full acknowledgement as citizens.\n\nIn 1955, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by the military against the historical leadership of Aflaq and al-Bitar led the Syrian and Iraqi parties to split into rival organizations\u2014the Qotri (Regionalist) Syria-based party and the Qawmi (Nationalist) Iraq-based party.<ref name='The Struggle for Power in Syria: Sectarianism, Regionalism and Tribalism in Politics'>{{cite news |first=Nikolaos |last=van Dam |title=The Struggle for Power in Syria: Sectarianism, Regionalism and Tribalism in Politics |year=1979 |publisher=I B Tauris}}</ref>  Both Ba'ath parties kept their names and maintained parallel structures, but became so antagonistic that the Syrian Ba'ath government became the only Arab government to support non-Arab [[Iran]] against Iraq during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].\n\nIn Syria, the Ba'ath Party has had a [[monopoly]] on political power since the party's 1963 coup. Ba'athists seized power in Iraq in 1963, but were deposed months later. They  returned to power in a 1968 coup and remained the sole party of government until the [[2003 Iraq invasion]].

Its origins lie in the mid-1920s, when a group of young Hanoi-based intellectuals began publishing revolutionary material. From 1928, the VNQD\u0110 attracted attention through its assassinations of French officials and Vietnamese collaborators. During the 1930s, the party was eclipsed by [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s [[Indochinese Communist Party]] (ICP). Vietnam was occupied by [[Imperial Japan|Japan]] during World War II and in the chaos that followed the Japanese surrender in 1945 the VNQD\u0110 and the ICP briefly joined forces in the fight for Vietnamese independence. After a falling out, Ho purged the VNQD\u0110, leaving his communist-dominated [[Viet Minh]] unchallenged as the foremost anti-colonial militant organisation.

The remnants of the VNQD\u0110 fled to the anti-communist [[South Vietnam|south]], where they remained until the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Socialism}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Anarchism]]\n* [[Anarchist economics]]\n* [[Anarchist schools of thought]]\n* [[Authoritarian socialism]]\n* [[Christian socialism]]\n* [[Communism]]\n* [[Democratic socialism]]\n* [[Ethical socialism]]\n* [[History of anarchism]]\n* [[History of communism]]\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[Labour movement]]\n* \"[[The labor problem]]\"\n* [[Left-libertarianism]]\n* [[Liberal socialism]]\n* [[Libertarianism]]\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\n* [[List of communist ideologies]]\n* [[Market socialism]]\n* [[Marxian economics]]\n* [[Marxism]]\n* [[Marxist schools of thought]]\n* [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]\n* [[Reformism]]\n* [[Revolutionary socialism]]\n* [[Social democracy]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Socialist economics]]\n* [[Socialist mode of production]]\n* [[Socialist state]]\n* [[State socialism]]\n* [[Syndicalism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* G.

It was also featured in an instrumental version in ''[[Pop'n Music|Pop'n Music 10]]''.\n\n[[Steven Spielberg]] had made Lauper the musical director for the [[The Goonies: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|''Goonies'' soundtrack]]. She sought out new bands to be included on the project including her friends, [[The Bangles]].\n\nLauper originally titled the song simply \"Good Enough\", but it was changed by [[Warner Bros.]], who wanted the title of the film to be part of the song title for marketing reasons.\n\nLauper refused to play the song live after 1987.

Cyndi's Mom is baking cookies for gas station customers, and Wendi operates a vegetable stand (set up inside a miniature wrestling ring) outside the station. A group of creditors (Piper, Blassie, Sheik, and Volkoff) show up to evict them and take over the station. While they argue with Mom and Pop (Albano), an old woman (Moolah) shows up and closes down Wendi's vegetable stand, putting in a [[Benihana]]-like set-up in its place. While packing, Cyndi removes a picture from the wall, which reveals the entrance to a cavern. Searching through the cave, Cyndi finds a treasure map and then encounters the Goonies (minus the character of Andy), who also have a copy of the map.\n\nSoon after, they encounter a group of pirates (who look just like the creditors, though it is never said if they are the same people as the creditors), and a supposed green-faced witch. Cyndi runs away as the Goonies are captured by the pirates. Running through the caverns, she encounters several skeletons and even some chefs who seem to work for the restaurant Benihana. Cyndi eventually finds herself trapped between the pirates and the green-faced witch on a log bridge. Unsure what to do, she cries out: \"Steven Spielberg, how do I get out of this one?\" The scene cuts to Spielberg in an editing room, apparently in the midst of editing the video as it is happening. Spielberg stops the editing machine and begins to give a solution, before realizing that he does not know how to help Cyndi.\n\nCyndi, along with the Goonies, is captured and taken aboard a pirate ship. The pirates, along with the green-faced witch and some female pirates ([[the Bangles]]), party, while forcing the Goonies and Cyndi to prepare food for them. Dave and Wendy (who had also gone into the cave to look for Cyndi) have also been captured, and are tied to the mast of the ship. Eventually, Cyndi, Dave, Wendi, and the Goonies break free, and after finding some treasure on the ship, toss some of it to the pirates, who fight amongst themselves for it. After subduing the green-faced witch, the Goonies escape from the ship along with Cyndi and her friends, giving her the remaining treasure that they found.\n\nCyndi, along with Dave and Wendi, returns through the cavern entrance in the gas station, armed with the extra treasure in hopes of appeasing the creditors. Despite all the treasure she offers, they still refuse. Cyndi then whistles, and in a cloud of smoke, Andr\u00e9 the Giant appears, and chases the creditors off (with Roddy Piper apparently breaking character, calling out to director Richard Donner, Spielberg, as well as Lauper and Wolffe that \"the video wasn't supposed to end like this\" while being pursued by Andr\u00e9).

The [[feature film]] directorial debut of [[John Lasseter]], it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The screenplay was written by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], and [[Alec Sokolow]] from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]]. The film features music by [[Randy Newman]], was produced by [[Bonnie Arnold]] and [[Ralph Guggenheim]], and was executive-produced by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Edwin Catmull]]. It features the voices of [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Erik von Detten]].\n\nTaking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] and an astronaut action figure, [[Buzz Lightyear]], as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], to friends who work together to be reunited with him after being separated from him.\n\nFollowing the success of Pixar's 1988 short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'', the company was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous [[story reel]]s, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and [...] this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under only minor financial constraints.\n\n''Toy Story'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California, on November 19, 1995, and was released in theatres in North America on November 22, 1995. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|title=Toy Story|work=The Numbers|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316140137/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|archive-date=March 16, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> eventually earning over $373 million at the worldwide [[box office]].

Andy's toys\u2014including [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], [[Mr. Potato Head]], Rex the dinosaur, Hamm the [[piggy bank]] and [[Slinky]] Dog\u2014fear they will be replaced by new toys that Andy receives during the party. To ease the situation, [[Sheriff Woody]], the toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, sends out [[army men]], led by Sarge, to spy on the party and report the gift arrivals to the other toys via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end without any of them being supplanted by newer toys, but then Andy receives a surprise gift: a [[Buzz Lightyear]] action figure.\n\nBuzz thinks he is a real space ranger who has crash-landed on a strange planet.  Buzz quickly impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, which makes Woody feel rejected compared to the newer, sleeker and more advanced Buzz. Two days before the move, Andy's mother tells him that he can only bring one toy to a family outing at the Pizza Planet restaurant. Knowing that Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzz behind a desk but ends up knocking him out of the window, causing most of the other toys (except Slinky and Bo) to accuse Woody of \"murdering\" Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy arrives and, after failing to find Buzz, takes Woody instead.\n\nWhen the family stops for [[Gasoline|gas]], Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their van. The two fight, falling out of the van in the process, and the family drives away, stranding them. After an argument, they manage to reach Pizza Planet by hitching a ride on a delivery truck. Buzz, still believing he is a real space ranger despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a [[crane game]] full of alien toys, where they are retrieved by Andy's sadistic, toy-destroying neighbor, Sid Phillips. At Sid's house, the two watch in horror as Sid steals his younger sister Hannah's doll, claiming the doll is sick, and then performs \"surgery\" to replace the doll's head with that of a [[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]].\n\nWhile attempting to escape, Buzz sees a television commercial for a Buzz Lightyear action figure and, after failing to fly out a window (breaking his arm off in the process), realizes he is just a toy and becomes despondent. Woody attempts to signal Andy's toys for help, but they misunderstand his gesture and ignore him. Sid's mutant toys fix Buzz's arm, and Woody restores Buzz's confidence by telling him about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy. The next morning, as Sid is about to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, Woody and the mutant toys come to life in front of Sid, terrifying him into no longer mistreating toys. Woody bids the mutant toys farewell and escapes with Buzz\u2014only to see Andy and his family departing for their new home.\n\nThe duo try to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog Scud sees them and gives chase. Buzz saves Woody from Scud but is left behind, so Woody attempts to rescue him with Andy's remote-controlled car, RC. Thinking that Woody is \"killing\" RC as well, the other toys attack Woody and toss him off the truck. Buzz and RC retrieve Woody; the other toys realize their mistake and try to help, but RC's batteries run out before he reaches the truck. Realizing that Sid's rocket is still strapped to Buzz's back, Woody ignites it, hurtling them towards the truck. Woody throws RC into the truck before he and Buzz soar into the air; Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket just before it explodes, and he glides with Woody to safety inside a box in the Davis's van, right next to Andy, who concludes they were in the car all along.\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] at their new home, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals; one of the toys is [[Mrs. Potato Head]], to Mr. Potato Head's delight. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of Toy Story characters}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]], a [[pull-string]] [[cowboy]] doll who is Andy's favourite toy.\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]], a space ranger [[action figure]] and Woody's rival, who later becomes his best friend.\n* [[Don Rickles]] as [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr. Potato Head]], a cynical potato-shaped doll with put-together pieces on his body.\n* [[Jim Varney]] as [[Slinky Dog]], a [[dachshund]] [[slinky]] toy.\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Rex, a nervous green [[Tyrannosaurus]] figurine.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Hamm, a smart-talking [[piggy bank]].\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], a [[Bisque doll|porcelain]] shepherdess doll and Woody's love interest.\n* [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]] as [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], Woody and Buzz's owner.\n* [[Erik von Detten]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Sid Phillips|Sid Phillips]], Andy's next door neighbor, who tortures toys for his own amusement.\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Mrs. Davis|Mrs. Davis]], Andy's mother.\n* [[R.

It was an eye-opening experience which awakened Lasseter to the possibilities offered by the new medium of computer-generated animation.{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=38}} Lasseter tried to pitch ''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]'' as a fully computer-animated film to Disney, but the idea was rejected and Lasseter was fired.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/waterman-gives-brave-little-toaster-new-lease-life-exclusive-56236/|title=Waterman Gives 'Brave Little Toaster' a New Lease of Life (Exclusive)|website=[[The Wrap]]|accessdate=July 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613060939/https://www.thewrap.com/waterman-gives-brave-little-toaster-new-lease-life-exclusive-56236/|archive-date=June 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> He then went on to work at [[Lucasfilm]] and in 1986, he became a founding member of Pixar. In 1986, Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]].{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=41}} At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the [[Pixar Image Computer]]'s capabilities. In 1988 Lasseter produced the short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'' told from the perspective of a toy and referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys. ''Tin Toy'' won the [[60th Academy Awards|1988 Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], the [[Timeline of computer animation in film and television|first computer-generated film to do so]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}}\n\n''Tin Toy'' gained Disney's attention, and the new team at [[The Walt Disney Company]]\u2014CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the film division]]\u2014began a quest to get Lasseter to come back.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder [[Ed Catmull]], \"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when [[Tim Burton]], who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney movie outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside Disney.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|title=How Pixar became the world's greatest animation company|website=www.telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=July 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625215743/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|archive-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth sides were willing.

They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney were to make a film with Pixar, it would be outside Schneider's purview, which aggravated Schneider.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=118}} After that first meeting, the Pixar contingent went home with low expectations and was surprised when Katzenberg called for another conference. Catmull, Smith, and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves (head of animation research and development), Jobs, and Lasseter. They brought with them an idea for a half-hour television special called ''A Tin Toy Christmas''. They reasoned that a television program would be a sensible way to gain experience before tackling a feature film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}}\n\nThey met with Katzenberg at a conference table in the [[Team Disney]] building at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Catmull and Smith considered it would be difficult to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation for how they treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as a micromanaging tyrant.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting: \"Everybody thinks I'm a tyrant. I ''am'' a tyrant. But I'm usually right.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} He threw out the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room: \"John, since you won't come work for me, I'm going to make it work this way.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} He invited the six visitors to mingle with the animators\u2014\"ask them anything at all\"\u2014and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg's statements.

At each of Pixar's presentations, Katzenberg tore much of it up, giving out detailed comments and notes. Katzenberg wanted primarily to add \"more edginess\" to the two main characters.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}} Disney wanted the film to appeal to both children and adults, and they asked for adult references to be added to the film.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> After many rounds of notes from Katzenberg and other Disney executives, the general consensus was that Woody had been stripped of almost all charm.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=129}} Hanks, while recording the dialogue for the story reels, exclaimed at one point that the character was a jerk.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}} Lasseter and his Pixar team had the first half of the movie ready to screen, so they brought it down to Burbank to show to Katzenberg and other Disney executives on November 19, 1993\u2014an event they later dubbed the \"Black Friday Incident\".<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\">{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897,00.html|title=Toy' Wonder|date=December 8, 1995|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121205204251/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897,00.html|archive-date=December 5, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} The results were disastrous.

Although Lasseter attempted to keep morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was \"a very scary time,\" recalled story department manager BZ Petroff.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\">{{cite AV media|title=Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition) \u2013 (Filmmakers Reflect)|medium=DVD|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|date=September 6, 2005}}</ref> Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and went over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}} Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists then drew the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with the revision, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on ''Toy Story'', Jobs funded the project personally. Jobs did not insert himself into the creative process, but instead managed the relationship with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}\n\nThe Pixar team came back with a new script three months later, with the character of Woody altered from being the tyrannical boss of Andy's toys to being their wise and caring leader.

Buzz Lightyear's character was also changed \"to make it more clear to the audience that he really doesn't realize he's a toy\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\" /> Katzenberg and Schneider approved the new approach and, by February 1994, the film was back in production.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} The voice actors returned in March 1994 to record their new lines.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> When production was greenlit, the crew quickly grew from its original size of 24 to 110, including 27 animators, 22 technical directors, and 61 other artists and engineers.<ref name=ew7 />{{sfn|Price|2008|p=133}} In comparison, ''[[The Lion King]]'', released in 1994, required a budget of $45&nbsp;million and a staff of 800.<ref name=ew7>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |title='Toy Story': The Inside Buzz |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 8, 1995 |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67q27oVus?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |archive-date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the early budgeting process, Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible, impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost-cutting.

Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=126}}\n\nEvery shot in the film passed through the hands of eight different teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting the location of the virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay within the limits of what might be done in a live-action film with real cameras, dollies, tripods, and cranes.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and [[Ash Brannon]], each shot went from Layout to the animation department. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} The animators used the Menv program to set each character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or \"[[keyframe]]s\") was created, the software built poses for the frames in-between.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" />\n\nAfterward, the animators compiled the scenes and developed a new storyboard with the computer-animated characters. They then added shading, lighting, visual effects, and finally used 300 computer processors to render the film to its final design.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" /> Under [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Tom Porter]], the shading team used RenderMan's shader language to create shader programs for each of a model's surfaces.

Each completed shot then went into rendering on a \"render farm\" of 117 [[Sun Microsystems]] computers that ran 24 hours a day.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} Finished animation emerged in a steady drip of around three minutes a week.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Depending on its complexity, each frame took from 45 minutes up to 30 hours to render.

Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a [[buddy film]] featuring \"real toys.\" [[Joss Whedon]] agreed, saying, \"It would have been a really bad musical, because it's a buddy movie. It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming \"Musicals are our orientation. Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand. It takes some of the onus off what they're asking for.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in ''Toy Story'' would not break into song, but the film would use [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|non-diegetic]] songs over the action, as in ''[[The Graduate]]'', to convey and amplify the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=128}} Disney and Lasseter tapped [[Randy Newman]] to compose the film. The edited ''Toy Story'' was due to Newman and [[Gary Rydstrom]] in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}}\n\nLasseter said, \"His songs are touching, witty, and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Newman wrote three original songs for the film, developing the film's signature song \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\" in one day.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The soundtrack for ''Toy Story'' was produced by [[Walt Disney Records]] and was released on November 22, 1995, the week of the film's release.\n\n=== Editing and pre-release ===\nIt was difficult for crew members to perceive the film's quality during much of the production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} According to [[Lee Unkrich]], one of the original editors of ''Toy Story'', a scene cut out of the original final edit featured Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently; Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the movie's creators thought the audience would love Buzz and Woody by that point.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Toy Story Deleted Scenes (Toy Story 10th Anniversary Edition) |last=Lasseter |first=John |publisher=[[Disney]] |year = 2005}}</ref> Another scene, in which Woody tried to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\" /> Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and he announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}}\n\nSources indicate that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production, and he had been talking to various companies, ranging from [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] to [[Microsoft]], about selling Pixar.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}} However, as the film progressed, Jobs became increasingly excited about it, feeling that he might be on the verge of transforming the movie industry.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of ''Toy Story'' that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks.

The [[feature film]] directorial debut of [[John Lasseter]], it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The screenplay was written by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], and [[Alec Sokolow]] from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]]. The film features music by [[Randy Newman]], was produced by [[Bonnie Arnold]] and [[Ralph Guggenheim]], and was executive-produced by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Edwin Catmull]]. It features the voices of [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Erik von Detten]].\n\nTaking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] and an astronaut action figure, [[Buzz Lightyear]], as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], to friends who work together to be reunited with him after being separated from him.\n\nFollowing the success of Pixar's 1988 short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'', the company was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous [[story reel]]s, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and [...] this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under only minor financial constraints.\n\n''Toy Story'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California, on November 19, 1995, and was released in theatres in North America on November 22, 1995. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|title=Toy Story|work=The Numbers|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316140137/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|archive-date=March 16, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> eventually earning over $373 million at the worldwide [[box office]].

Andy's toys\u2014including [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], [[Mr. Potato Head]], Rex the dinosaur, Hamm the [[piggy bank]] and [[Slinky]] Dog\u2014fear they will be replaced by new toys that Andy receives during the party. To ease the situation, [[Sheriff Woody]], the toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, sends out [[army men]], led by Sarge, to spy on the party and report the gift arrivals to the other toys via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end without any of them being supplanted by newer toys, but then Andy receives a surprise gift: a [[Buzz Lightyear]] action figure.\n\nBuzz thinks he is a real space ranger who has crash-landed on a strange planet.  Buzz quickly impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, which makes Woody feel rejected compared to the newer, sleeker and more advanced Buzz. Two days before the move, Andy's mother tells him that he can only bring one toy to a family outing at the Pizza Planet restaurant. Knowing that Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzz behind a desk but ends up knocking him out of the window, causing most of the other toys (except Slinky and Bo) to accuse Woody of \"murdering\" Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy arrives and, after failing to find Buzz, takes Woody instead.\n\nWhen the family stops for [[Gasoline|gas]], Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their van. The two fight, falling out of the van in the process, and the family drives away, stranding them. After an argument, they manage to reach Pizza Planet by hitching a ride on a delivery truck. Buzz, still believing he is a real space ranger despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a [[crane game]] full of alien toys, where they are retrieved by Andy's sadistic, toy-destroying neighbor, Sid Phillips. At Sid's house, the two watch in horror as Sid steals his younger sister Hannah's doll, claiming the doll is sick, and then performs \"surgery\" to replace the doll's head with that of a [[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]].\n\nWhile attempting to escape, Buzz sees a television commercial for a Buzz Lightyear action figure and, after failing to fly out a window (breaking his arm off in the process), realizes he is just a toy and becomes despondent. Woody attempts to signal Andy's toys for help, but they misunderstand his gesture and ignore him. Sid's mutant toys fix Buzz's arm, and Woody restores Buzz's confidence by telling him about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy. The next morning, as Sid is about to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, Woody and the mutant toys come to life in front of Sid, terrifying him into no longer mistreating toys. Woody bids the mutant toys farewell and escapes with Buzz\u2014only to see Andy and his family departing for their new home.\n\nThe duo try to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog Scud sees them and gives chase. Buzz saves Woody from Scud but is left behind, so Woody attempts to rescue him with Andy's remote-controlled car, RC. Thinking that Woody is \"killing\" RC as well, the other toys attack Woody and toss him off the truck. Buzz and RC retrieve Woody; the other toys realize their mistake and try to help, but RC's batteries run out before he reaches the truck.

In 1986, Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]].{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=41}} At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the [[Pixar Image Computer]]'s capabilities. In 1988 Lasseter produced the short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'' told from the perspective of a toy and referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys. ''Tin Toy'' won the [[60th Academy Awards|1988 Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], the [[Timeline of computer animation in film and television|first computer-generated film to do so]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}}\n\n''Tin Toy'' gained Disney's attention, and the new team at [[The Walt Disney Company]]\u2014CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the film division]]\u2014began a quest to get Lasseter to come back.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder [[Ed Catmull]], \"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when [[Tim Burton]], who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney movie outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside Disney.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|title=How Pixar became the world's greatest animation company|website=www.telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=July 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625215743/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|archive-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth sides were willing.

They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney were to make a film with Pixar, it would be outside Schneider's purview, which aggravated Schneider.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=118}} After that first meeting, the Pixar contingent went home with low expectations and was surprised when Katzenberg called for another conference. Catmull, Smith, and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves (head of animation research and development), Jobs, and Lasseter. They brought with them an idea for a half-hour television special called ''A Tin Toy Christmas''. They reasoned that a television program would be a sensible way to gain experience before tackling a feature film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}}\n\nThey met with Katzenberg at a conference table in the [[Team Disney]] building at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Catmull and Smith considered it would be difficult to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation for how they treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as a micromanaging tyrant.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting: \"Everybody thinks I'm a tyrant. I ''am'' a tyrant. But I'm usually right.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} He threw out the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room: \"John, since you won't come work for me, I'm going to make it work this way.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} He invited the six visitors to mingle with the animators\u2014\"ask them anything at all\"\u2014and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg's statements. Lasseter felt he would be able to work with Disney and the two companies began negotiations.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} Pixar at this time was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed a deal with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar's proprietary technology for making 3-D animation, but Jobs refused.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} In another case, Jobs demanded Pixar would have part ownership of the film and its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels, but Katzenberg refused.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Disney and Pixar reached accord on contract terms in an agreement dated May 3, 1991, and signed on in early July.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=122}} Eventually, the deal specified that Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues.{{sfn|Kanfer|2000|p=229}}<ref name=\"BizWeekBOX\" /> It had the option (but not the obligation) to do Pixar's next two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the characters in the film.

Lasseter decided Tinny was \"too antiquated\"; the character was first changed to a military action figure and then given a space theme. Tinny's name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually Buzz Lightyear (after astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]]).{{sfn|Price|2008|p=125}} Lightyear's design was modeled on the suits worn by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts as well as [[G.I.

However, character designer [[Bud Luckey]] suggested that Woody could be changed to a cowboy ventriloquist dummy.

The crew shifted to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter attempted to keep morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was \"a very scary time,\" recalled story department manager BZ Petroff.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\">{{cite AV media|title=Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition) \u2013 (Filmmakers Reflect)|medium=DVD|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|date=September 6, 2005}}</ref> Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and went over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}} Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists then drew the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with the revision, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on ''Toy Story'', Jobs funded the project personally. Jobs did not insert himself into the creative process, but instead managed the relationship with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}\n\nThe Pixar team came back with a new script three months later, with the character of Woody altered from being the tyrannical boss of Andy's toys to being their wise and caring leader. It also included a more adult-oriented staff meeting amongst the toys rather than the juvenile group discussion that had existed in earlier drafts. Buzz Lightyear's character was also changed \"to make it more clear to the audience that he really doesn't realize he's a toy\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\" /> Katzenberg and Schneider approved the new approach and, by February 1994, the film was back in production.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} The voice actors returned in March 1994 to record their new lines.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> When production was greenlit, the crew quickly grew from its original size of 24 to 110, including 27 animators, 22 technical directors, and 61 other artists and engineers.<ref name=ew7 />{{sfn|Price|2008|p=133}} In comparison, ''[[The Lion King]]'', released in 1994, required a budget of $45&nbsp;million and a staff of 800.<ref name=ew7>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |title='Toy Story': The Inside Buzz |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 8, 1995 |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67q27oVus?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |archive-date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the early budgeting process, Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible, impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost-cutting. Despite this, the $17 million production budget proved inadequate, especially given the major revision that was necessary after Katzenberg had pushed them to make Woody too edgy. Jobs demanded more funds to complete the film and insisted that Disney was liable for the cost overruns.

Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was first either created out of [[Modelling clay|clay]] or modeled from a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer-animated design.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\">{{cite news|last=Snider|first=Burr|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.12/toy.story.html|title=The Toy Story Story|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|pages=1\u20136|date=December 1995|accessdate=March 13, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131017031124/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.12/toy.story.html|archive-date=October 17, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Once the animators had a model, its articulation and motion controls were coded; this allowed each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /> Out of all the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /><ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\">{{cite journal|last=Henne |first=Mark |last2=Hickel |first2=Hal |last3=Johnson |first3=Ewan |last4=Konishi |first4=Sonoks |title=The Making of Toy Story |journal=CompCon '96.

Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=126}}\n\nEvery shot in the film passed through the hands of eight different teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting the location of the virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay within the limits of what might be done in a live-action film with real cameras, dollies, tripods, and cranes.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and [[Ash Brannon]], each shot went from Layout to the animation department. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} The animators used the Menv program to set each character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or \"[[keyframe]]s\") was created, the software built poses for the frames in-between.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" />\n\nAfterward, the animators compiled the scenes and developed a new storyboard with the computer-animated characters. They then added shading, lighting, visual effects, and finally used 300 computer processors to render the film to its final design.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" /> Under [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Tom Porter]], the shading team used RenderMan's shader language to create shader programs for each of a model's surfaces. A few surfaces in ''Toy Story'' came from real objects: a shader for the curtain fabric in Andy's room used a scan of actual cloth.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=136}} Under Galyn Susman and [[Sharon Calahan]], the lighting team orchestrated the final lighting of the shot after animation and shading. Each completed shot then went into rendering on a \"render farm\" of 117 [[Sun Microsystems]] computers that ran 24 hours a day.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} Finished animation emerged in a steady drip of around three minutes a week.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Depending on its complexity, each frame took from 45 minutes up to 30 hours to render. The film required 800,000 machine hours and 114,240 frames of animation in total.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /><ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"CNN110animators\" /> There are over 77 minutes of animation spread across 1,561 shots.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} A camera team, aided by [[David DiFrancesco]], recorded the frames onto [[film stock]]. To fit a 1.85:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], ''Toy Story'' was rendered at a mere 1,536 by 922 pixels, with each of them corresponding to roughly a quarter-inch of screen area on a typical cinema screen.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} During post-production, the film was sent to [[Skywalker Sound]], where the sound effects were mixed with the music score.<ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" />\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Toy Story (soundtrack)}}\n\nDisney was concerned with Lasseter's position on the use of music. Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a [[buddy film]] featuring \"real toys.\" [[Joss Whedon]] agreed, saying, \"It would have been a really bad musical, because it's a buddy movie. It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming \"Musicals are our orientation. Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand. It takes some of the onus off what they're asking for.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in ''Toy Story'' would not break into song, but the film would use [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|non-diegetic]] songs over the action, as in ''[[The Graduate]]'', to convey and amplify the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=128}} Disney and Lasseter tapped [[Randy Newman]] to compose the film. The edited ''Toy Story'' was due to Newman and [[Gary Rydstrom]] in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}}\n\nLasseter said, \"His songs are touching, witty, and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Newman wrote three original songs for the film, developing the film's signature song \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\" in one day.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The soundtrack for ''Toy Story'' was produced by [[Walt Disney Records]] and was released on November 22, 1995, the week of the film's release.\n\n=== Editing and pre-release ===\nIt was difficult for crew members to perceive the film's quality during much of the production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} According to [[Lee Unkrich]], one of the original editors of ''Toy Story'', a scene cut out of the original final edit featured Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently; Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the movie's creators thought the audience would love Buzz and Woody by that point.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Toy Story Deleted Scenes (Toy Story 10th Anniversary Edition) |last=Lasseter |first=John |publisher=[[Disney]] |year = 2005}}</ref> Another scene, in which Woody tried to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\" /> Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and he announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}}\n\nSources indicate that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production, and he had been talking to various companies, ranging from [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] to [[Microsoft]], about selling Pixar.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}} However, as the film progressed, Jobs became increasingly excited about it, feeling that he might be on the verge of transforming the movie industry.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of ''Toy Story'' that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}} The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}}\n\n== Release ==\n[[File:El Capitan Theatre, Hollywood, California (2997200450).jpg|thumb|The [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles, where ''Toy Story''{{'}}s Los Angeles, California's premiere took place on November 19, 1995.|alt=Exterior shot of the El Capitan Theatre.]]\n\nThere were two premieres of ''Toy Story'' in November 1995.

In 2013, Tonight was voted 2nd in the Q-dance Harder Styles top 1000.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.q-dance.com/france/en/news/harder-styles-top-1000-199-1/ |title=The Harder Styles Top 1000 &#124; 199 \u2013 1 |publisher=Q-dance |date=2013-10-20 |accessdate=2015-11-22}}</ref> 2010 saw further strong solo releases on a variety of Scantraxx sub labels, including 'A Complex Situation' on Scantraxx Reloaded, the experimental 'Feedback' on Scantraxx Silver, a collaboration with DJ Isaac called 'Lost in Music' released on Scantraxx Special and his first appearance on the newly formed A\u00b2 records with old collaborators the Alpha\u00b2 for their track 'Atrocious'. Wildstylez also produced his first Anthem, 'No Time to Waste' for hardstyle Festival [[Defqon.1 Festival|Defqon.1]]. 'No Time to Waste' was accompanied by a Hardcore and Dubstyle Remix on release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Wildstylez-No-Time-To-Waste-Defqon1-Festival-2010-Anthem/master/256324 |title=Wildstylez \u2013 No Time To Waste (Defqon.1 Festival 2010 Anthem) |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Wildstylez left the [[Scantraxx]] main label and, together with Noisecontrollers, established a new Hardstyle label called 'Digital:Age'. Having worked together previously on collaborations and remixes of each other's tracks, both Wildstylez and Noisecontrollers felt they needed to leave their parent labels to take their careers to the next level.\n\n[[File:Wildstylez.jpg|thumb|right|Wildstylez performing at Intents Festival, 2011]]2011 saw the first two Digital:Age releases from both Wildstylez and Noisecontrollers, titled 'A Different Story' and 'Stardust'. Following this, Wildstylez released four solo tracks on Digital:Age, 'Huh?', 'Back to Basics', 'Lonely' and 'Into the Light'. In 2012 Wildstylez produced both the Dutch and Australian [[Defqon.1 Festival|Defqon.1]] anthems. The Dutch Anthem, 'World of Madness', saw him collaborate again with [[Headhunterz]] & Noisecontrollers.\n\n==2012\u2014present==\n\n{{Listen\n|pos          = left\n|filename     = Wildstylez_-_Year_of_Summer.ogg\n|title        = 'Year of Summer'\n|description  = Sample of 'Year of Summer' by ''Wildstylez'', released in 2012 by Q-Dance Records.}}\n\nIn 2012 Wildstylez had his final release on Digital:Age and also had releases on labels A\u00b2 Records, Brennan Heart Music, Q-Dance Records and a collection of self-released free tracks via social media. These free releases included the popular '[[David Guetta]] \u2013 Wild Ones (Wildstylez Bootleg)'. His 2012 track with singer Niels Geusebroek, 'Year of Summer', brought Wildstylez into the mainstream dance music in the Netherlands, reaching platinum status and also receiving airtime on Dutch daytime radio stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatport.com/artist/wildstylez/83173 |title=Wildstylez Tracks & Releases on Beatport |publisher=Beatport.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://globaldanceelectronic.blogspot.nl/2013/09/an-interview-with-wildstylez-by-global.html|title=An Interview with WildStylez by Global Dance Electronic|website=globaldanceelectronic.blogspot.nl|access-date=2017-05-31}}</ref> 2012 also saw the release of the popular dance floor number 'Lose My Mind' a collaboration with Brennan Heart, the video clip being the most viewed on Wildstylez [[YouTube]] channel with over 27 million views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP6Tz5tP8EE |title=Brennan Heart & Wildstylez \u2013 Lose My Mind (Official video clip) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-09-13 |accessdate=2019-11-30}}</ref> At the beginning of 2013, a statement from [[Scantraxx]] Manager Rudy Peters confirmed that Wildstylez had indeed left the [[Scantraxx]] brand after five years, also implying that Digital:Age had been a [[Scantraxx]] affiliated label when formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scantraxx.com/news/a-statement-from-scantraxx-recordz-label-manager-rudy-peters/446 |title=A statement from Scantraxx Recordz Label Manager, Rudy Peters \u2013 News |publisher=Scantraxx.Com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-22}}</ref> In January 2013, Wildstylez had the opportunity to host his own X-Qlusive. Held on the 19th of January at the Heineken Music Hall in the Netherlands, X-Qlusive:Wildstylez was a sold-out event and included popular Hardstyle artists and former collaborators Noisecontrollers, Headhunterz and Alpha\u00b2 on the lineup.<ref name=\"q-dance1\"/>\n\nIn late 2013, Wildstylez formed his own record label titled 'Lose Control Music'. The Hardstyle label was formed in partnership with 'Be Yourself Music', a dance related record label and management company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beyourselfmusic.com/label-info/ |title=Home |publisher=BeyourselfMusic.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-22}}</ref> Wildstylez continued the trend of artists having connections with 'Be Yourself Music', who had also recently established similar partnerships with popular Hardstyle artists Frontliner and [[Brennan Heart]]. In late 2013, Wildstylez had his first release on 'Lose Control Music' with the single 'Lights Go Out'. [[Hardstyle]] producer Max Enforcer has since joined 'Lose Control Music', with Wildstylez having one release with him. As of 2014, Wildstylez continues to release on 'Lose Control Music'. In 2015 a track he did together with Dutch hardstyle duo [[Audiotricz]] entitled \"Turn the Music Up\" was released on [[W&W]]'s Sublabel of [[Armada Music]], [[Mainstage Music]]. 2016 Saw Joram reunite with [[Headhunterz]] and play another set as Project One at [[Qlimax]] 2016. They released new music together under the Project One title, and also formed a new label called 'Art of Creation'.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hardnews.nl/headhunterz-wildstylez-richten-nieuw-label-op-art-creation/|title=Headhunterz & Wildstylez richten nieuw label op: Art of Creation {{!}}{{!}} Hard News|date=2018-02-02|work=Hard News|access-date=2018-05-01|language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017 he was chosen to create the anthem for Qlimax, \"Temple Of Light\". 2018 brought his first collaboration with [[Hardwell]], after remixing one of his tracks in 2013.
