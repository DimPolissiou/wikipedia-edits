Altman is known as five-time nominee of the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and an enduring figure from the [[New Hollywood]] era with such directors as [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Sidney Lumet]], and [[David Lynch]]. Altman was considered a \"maverick\" in making [[Cinema of the United States|films]] with a highly naturalistic but stylized  and satirical aesthetic, unlike most Hollywood films. He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema.\n\nHis style of filmmaking covered many genres, but usually with a \"[[subversion|subversive]]\" twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views. Altman developed a reputation for being \"anti-Hollywood\" and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style. However, actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise, thereby inspiring their own creativity.\n\nHe preferred large [[ensemble cast]]s for his films, and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors. This produced a more natural, more dynamic, and more complex experience for the viewer. He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen. Critic [[Pauline Kael]], writing about his directing style, said that Altman could \"make film fireworks out of next to nothing.\"<ref name=Wakeman /> Altman's most famous directorial achievements include, ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H*]]'' (1970), ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), ''[[3 Women]]'' (1977), ''[[Secret Honor]]'' (1984), ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992), ''[[Short Cuts]]'' (1993), and ''[[Gosford Park]]'' (2001). \n\nIn 2006, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] recognized Altman's body of work with an [[Academy Honorary Award]]. He never won a competitive Oscar despite seven nominations. His films ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), and ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) have been selected for the United States [[National Film Registry]]. Altman is one of three filmmakers whose films have won the [[Golden Bear]] at [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], the [[Golden Lion]] at [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]], and the [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm]] at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] (the other two being [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]], and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]).\n\n== Early life and career ==\nAltman was born on February 20, 1925, in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], the son of Helen (n\u00e9e Matthews), a ''[[Mayflower]]'' descendant from [[Nebraska]], and Bernard Clement Altman, a wealthy insurance salesman and amateur gambler, who came from an upper-class family.

He worked in publicity for a company that had invented a [[tattoo]]ing machine to identify dogs. He entered filmmaking on a whim, selling a script to [[RKO]] for the 1948 picture ''[[Bodyguard (1948 film)|Bodyguard]]'', which he co-wrote with George W. George. Altman's immediate success encouraged him to move to [[New York City]], where he attempted to forge a career as a writer. Having enjoyed little success, in 1949 he returned to Kansas City, where he accepted a job as a director and writer of industrial films for the [[Calvin Company]]. In February 2012, an early Calvin film directed by Altman, ''Modern Football'' (1951), was found by filmmaker Gary Huggins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2012/03/fan-uncovers-robert-altmans-first-film/1 |title=Fan uncovers Robert Altman's first film |publisher=Content.usatoday.com |date=2012-03-14 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcook/2012/03/13/robert-altmans-lost-classic-modern-football/ |title=Robert Altman's Lost Classic: 'Modern Football' |magazine=Forbes |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref>\n\nAltman directed some 65 industrial films and documentaries before being hired by a local businessman in 1956 to write and direct a feature film in Kansas City on [[juvenile delinquency]]. The film, titled ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', made for $60,000, was purchased by [[United Artists]] for $150,000, and released in 1957. While primitive, this teen [[exploitation film]] contained the foundations of Altman's later work in its use of casual, naturalistic dialogue. With its success, Altman moved from Kansas City to California for the last time. He co-directed ''[[The James Dean Story]]'' (1957), a documentary rushed into theaters to capitalize on the actor's recent death and marketed to his emerging cult following.\n\n== Television work ==\nAltman's first forays into TV directing were on the [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] drama series ''[[Pulse of the City]]'' (1953\u20131954), and an episode of the 1956 western series ''[[The Sheriff of Cochise]]''. After [[Alfred Hitchcock]] saw Altman's early features ''The Delinquents'' and ''The James Dean Story'', he hired him as a director for his [[CBS]] anthology series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. After just two episodes, Altman resigned due to differences with a producer, but this exposure enabled him to forge a successful TV career. Over the next decade Altman worked prolifically in television (and almost exclusively in series dramas) directing multiple episodes of ''[[Whirlybirds]]'', ''[[The Millionaire (TV series)|The Millionaire]]'', ''[[U.S. Marshal (TV series)|U.S. Marshal]]'', ''[[The Troubleshooters (1959 TV series)|The Troubleshooters]]'', ''[[The Roaring 20s (TV series)|The Roaring 20s]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'', ''[[Kraft Mystery Theater]]'',  ''[[Combat!]]'', as well as single episodes of several other notable series including ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (the fourth season episode [[List of Maverick episodes|\"Bolt From the Blue\"]] also written by Altman and starring [[Roger Moore]]), ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', ''[[Surfside 6]]'', ''[[Peter Gunn]]'', and ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.\n\nThrough this early work on industrial films and TV series, Altman experimented with narrative technique and developed his characteristic use of overlapping dialogue. He also learned to work quickly and efficiently on a limited budget. Though he was frequently fired from TV projects for refusing to conform to network mandates, as well as insisting on expressing political subtexts and antiwar sentiments during the Vietnam years, Altman always was able to land new assignments. In 1964, the producers decided to expand \"Once Upon a Savage Night\", one of his episodes of ''[[Kraft Suspense Theatre]]'', for release as a TV movie under the title ''[[Nightmare in Chicago]]''.\n\nTwo years later, Altman was hired to direct the low-budget space travel feature ''[[Countdown (1968 film)|Countdown]]'', but was fired within days of the project's conclusion because he had refused to edit the film to a manageable length. He did not direct another film until ''[[That Cold Day in the Park]]'' (1969), which was a critical and box-office disaster.\n\n== Mainstream success ==\n\nIn 1969, Altman was offered the script for ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'', an adaptation of a little-known [[Korean War]]-era novel satirizing life in the armed services; more than a dozen other filmmakers had passed on it. Altman had been hesitant to take the production, and the shoot was so tumultuous that [[Elliott Gould]] and [[Donald Sutherland]] tried to have Altman fired over his unorthodox filming methods. Nevertheless, ''MASH'' was widely hailed as an immediate classic upon its 1970 release. It won the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' at the 1970 [[Cannes Film Festival]] and netted five [[Academy Award]] nominations. It was Altman's highest-grossing film, released during a time of increasing anti-war sentiment in the United States. The [[Academy Film Archive]] preserved ''MASH'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=M*A*S*H&filmmaker=&category=All&collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\nNow recognized as a major talent, Altman notched critical successes with ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), a [[Revisionist Western]] in which the mordant songs of [[Leonard Cohen]] underscore a gritty vision of the American frontier; ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), a controversial adaptation of the [[Raymond Chandler]] novel (scripted by [[Leigh Brackett]]) now ranked as a seminal influence on the [[neo-noir]] subgenre; ''[[Thieves Like Us (film)|Thieves Like Us]]'' (1974), an adaptation of the Edward Anderson novel previously filmed by [[Nicholas Ray]] as ''[[They Live by Night]]'' (1949); ''[[California Split]]'' (1974), a gambling comedy-drama shot partially on location in [[Reno, Nevada]]; and ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), which had a strong political theme set against the world of [[country music]]. The stars of the film wrote their own songs; [[Keith Carradine]] won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for the song \"[[I'm Easy (Keith Carradine song)|I'm Easy]]\". Although his films were often met with divisive notices, many of the prominent film critics of the era (including [[Pauline Kael]], [[Vincent Canby]] and [[Roger Ebert]]) remained steadfastly loyal to his oeuvre throughout the decade.\n\nAudiences took some time to appreciate his films, and he did not want to have to satisfy studio officials. In 1970, following the release of ''MASH,'' he founded Lion's Gate Films to have independent production freedom. Altman's company is not to be confused with the current [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]], a Canada/U.S. entertainment company.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cook |first=David A. |date=2000 |title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in the Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam, 1970\u20131979 |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-23265-8 |page=97}}</ref> The films he made through his company included ''[[Brewster McCloud]]'', ''[[A Wedding]]'', ''[[3 Women]]'', and ''[[Quintet (film)|Quintet]]''.\n\n== Later career and renaissance ==\n[[File:Robert Altman - 1976.jpg|thumb|left|Altman with [[Lillian Gish]] and [[Lily Tomlin]] at ''Nashville'' awards ceremony in 1976]]\nIn 1980, he directed the musical film ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]''. Produced by [[Robert Evans (film producer)|Robert Evans]] and written by [[Jules Feiffer]], the film was based on the comic strip / cartoon [[Popeye|of the same name]] and starred the comedian [[Robin Williams]] in his film debut. Designed as a vehicle to increase Altman's commercial clout following a series of critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful low-budget films in the late 1970s (including ''3&nbsp;Women'', ''A&nbsp;Wedding'' and ''Quintet''), the production was filmed on location in [[Malta]]. It was soon beleaguered by heavy drug and alcohol use among most of the cast and crew, including the director; Altman reportedly clashed with Evans, Williams (who threatened to leave the film), and songwriter [[Harry Nilsson]] (who departed midway through the shoot, leaving [[Van Dyke Parks]] to finish the orchestrations). Although the film grossed $60&nbsp;million worldwide on a $20&nbsp;million budget and was the second highest-grossing film Altman had directed to that point, it failed to meet studio expectations and was considered a box office disappointment.\n\nIn 1981, the director sold Lion's Gate to producer [[Jonathan Taplin]] after his political satire ''[[Health (film)|Health]]'' (shot in early 1979 for a Christmas release) was shelved by longtime distributor [[20th Century Fox]] following tepid test and festival screenings throughout 1980. The departure of longtime Altman partisan [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] from Fox also played a decisive role in forestalling the release of the film.\n\nUnable to secure major financing in the post-New Hollywood [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] era because of his mercurial reputation and the particularly tumultuous events surrounding the production of ''Popeye'', Altman began to \"direct literate dramatic properties on shoestring budgets for stage, home video, television, and limited theatrical release,\" including the acclaimed ''[[Secret Honor]]'' and ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'', a critically antipodean adaptation of a play that Altman had directed on Broadway.<ref name=McGilligan>{{cite book |author=McGilligan, Patrick |title=Robert Altman: Jumping off the cliff |publisher=Macmillan |year=1989}}</ref>{{rp|page=115}}\n\nIn 1982, Altman staged a production of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' at the [[University of Michigan]], where he concurrently taught a course on his films. Shortly thereafter, he returned to film ''Secret Honor'' with students. In 2008, the University of Michigan Library acquired Altman's archive.<ref name=ManyHatsUMich>{{cite web |url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/online-exhibits/exhibits/show/altman/opera-and-the-university-of-mi |title=Altman at the University of Michigan |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] |series=The many hats of Robert Altman: A life in cinema |type=online exhibit}}</ref> He also co-wrote [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s 1983 hit single \"[[Black Sheep (John Anderson song)|Black Sheep]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1546370/nashville-director-robert-altman-dies.jhtml |title=Nashville director Robert Altman dies |date=21 November 2006 |work=[[Country Music Television]] |accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[teen comedy]] ''[[O.C. and Stiggs]]'' (1985), an abortive return to Hollywood filmmaking retrospectively characterized by the [[British Film Institute]] as \"probably Altman's least successful film\", received a belated limited commercial release in 1987 after being shelved by [[MGM]].\n\nAdapted by Altman and [[Sam Shepard]] for [[The Cannon Group]] from the latter's [[Pulitzer Prize]]-nominated play, ''[[Fool for Love (film)|Fool for Love]]'' (1985) featured the playwright-actor alongside [[Kim Basinger]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], and [[Randy Quaid]]; it fared better than most of his films from the era, earning $900,000 domestically on a $2&nbsp;million budget and positive reviews from [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Vincent Canby]]. Still, widespread popularity with audiences continued to elude him.\n\nHe continued to regain a modicum of critical favor for his television [[mockumentary]] ''[[Tanner '88]]'' (1988), a collaboration with [[Garry Trudeau]] set in the milieu of a United States presidential campaign, for which he earned a [[Primetime Emmy Award]].\n\nIn 1990, Altman directed ''[[Vincent & Theo]]'', a [[biopic]] about [[Vincent van Gogh]] that was intended as a television miniseries for broadcast in the United Kingdom. A theatrical version of the film was a modest success in the United States, marking a significant turning point in the director's critical resurgence.{{efn|Powerfully realized study of [[Vincent van Gogh]] and his brother Theo marks a return to the mainstream arena for director Robert Altman.

Co-produced by the influential [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] (''[[The Sting]]'', ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]''), the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. While he did not win the Oscar, he was awarded Best Director by the [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[BAFTA]], and the [[New York Film Critics Circle]].\n\nAltman then directed ''[[Short Cuts (film)|Short Cuts]]'' (1993), an ambitious adaptation of several short stories by [[Raymond Carver]], which portrayed the lives of various citizens of Los Angeles over the course of several days. The film's large cast and intertwining of many different storylines were similar to his large-cast films of the 1970s; he won the [[Golden Lion]] at the 1993 [[Venice International Film Festival]] and another Oscar nomination for Best Director. In 1996, Altman directed ''[[Kansas City (1996 film)|Kansas City]]'', expressing his love of 1930s jazz through a complicated kidnapping story. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1999.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web |title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter&nbsp;A |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''[[Gosford Park]]'' (2001), a large-cast, British country house [[murder mystery]], was included on many critics' lists of the ten best films of that year. It won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay ([[Julian Fellowes]]) plus six more nominations, including two for Altman, as Best Director and Best Picture.\n\nWorking with independent studios such as the now-shuttered Fine Line, Artisan (which was absorbed into today's [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]]), and USA Films (now [[Focus Features]]), gave Altman the edge in making the kinds of films he always wanted to make without studio interference. A [[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|film version]] of [[Garrison Keillor]]'s public radio series ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' was released in June&nbsp;2006. Altman was still developing new projects up until his death, including a film based on ''[[Hands on a Hard Body: The Documentary]]'' (1997).<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=19678 |title=Robert Altman has a hard body |magazine=Empire}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded Altman an [[Academy Honorary Award]] for Lifetime Achievement. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that he had received a heart transplant approximately ten or eleven years earlier. The director then quipped that perhaps the Academy had acted prematurely in recognizing the body of his work, as he felt like he might have four more decades of life ahead of him.\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Family ===\nAltman was married three times. His first wife was LaVonne Elmer. They were married from 1947 to 1949, and had a daughter, Christine. His second wife was Lotus Corelli. They were married from 1950 to 1955, and had two sons, Michael and Stephen. At fourteen, Michael wrote the lyrics to \"[[Suicide Is Painless]]\", the theme song to Altman's movie, ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]''. Steven is a [[production designer]] who often worked with his father. Altman's third wife was Kathryn Reed. They were married from 1957 until his death in 2006. They had two sons, Robert and Matthew.

He understood the creative limits imposed by the television genre, and now set out to direct and write films which would express his personal visions about American society and Hollywood. His films would later be described as \"[[auteur]]istic attacks\" and \"idiosyncratic variations\" of traditional films, typically using subtle comedy or satire as a way of expressing his observations.<ref name=Wakeman>John Wakeman, ed. ''World Film Directors \u2013 Vol. 2'', H. W. Wilson Co., N.Y. (1988) pp. 29\u201339</ref>\n\nHis films were typically related to political, ideological, and personal subjects, and Altman was known for \"refusing to compromise his own artistic vision.\"<ref name=Hillstrom /> He has been described as \"anti-Hollywood,\" often ignoring the social pressures that affected others in the industry, which made it more difficult for him to get many of his films seen. However, he still felt that his independence as a filmmaker did him little harm overall:\n\n{{quote|I don't think there's a filmmaker alive, or who ever lived, who's had a better shake than I've had. I've never been without a project and it's always been a project of my own choosing. So I don't know how much better it could be. I have not become a mogul, I don't build castles and I don't have a vast personal fortune, but I have been able to do what I've wanted to do and I've done it a lot.<ref name=Stevens />}}\n\n\"Altman was a genuine movie maverick,\" states author [[Ian Freer]], because he went against the commercial conformity of the movie industry: \"He was the scourge of the film establishment, and his work generally cast an astute, scathing eye over the breadth of American culture, often exploding genres and character archetypes; Altman was fascinated by people with imperfections, people as they really are, not as the movies would have you believe.\"<ref name=Freer>{{cite book |author=Freer, Ian |title=Moviemakers |publisher=Quercus |place=London, UK |year=2009 |pages=106\u2013109}}</ref> Director [[Alan Rudolph]], during a special tribute to Altman, refers to his moviemaking style as \"Altmanesque.\"<ref name=NYT-07>{{cite news |author=Carr, David |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/movies/21altman.html?_r=0 |title=A very Altmanesque tribute to Altman |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 21, 2007}}</ref>\n\nWith his independent style of directing, he developed a bad reputation among screenwriters and those on the business side of films. He admits, \"I have a bad reputation with writers, developed over the years: 'Oh, he doesn't do what you write, blah blah blah.' ... [[Ring Lardner, Jr.|Ring Lardner]] was very pissed off with me,\" for not following his script.<ref name=Thompson/>{{rp|page=18}} Nor did Altman get along well with studio heads, once punching an executive in the nose and knocking him into a swimming pool because he insisted he cut six minutes from a film he was working on.<ref name=Armstrong/>{{rp|page=9}}\n\nHis reputation among actors is quite different, however. With them, his independence sometimes extended to his choice of actors, often going against consensus. [[Cher]], for instance, credits him for launching her career with both the stage play and film, ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'' (1982). \"Without Bob I would have never had a film career. Everyone told him not to cast me. Everyone. ... Nobody would give me a break. I am convinced that Bob was the only one who was brave enough to do it.\" Others, like [[Julianne Moore]], describes working with him:\n\n{{quote|You know, all this talk about Bob being this kind of irascible, difficult kind of person? Well, he was never that way with an actor or with a creative person that I saw. Never, never, never. He saved all that for the money people.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=431}}}}\n\nHowever, director [[Robert Dornhelm]] states, Altman \"looked at film as a pure, artistic venue.\" With ''[[Short Cuts (film)|Short Cuts]]'' (1993), for instance, the distributor \"begged him\" to cut a few minutes from the length, to keep it commercially viable: \"Bob just thought the Antichrist was trying to destroy his art. They were well-meaning people who wanted him to get what he deserved, which was a big commercial hit. But when it came down to the art or the money, he was with the art.\"<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|page=438}}\n\n[[Sally Kellerman]], noting Altman's willful attitude, still looks back with regret at giving up a chance to act in one of his films:\n\n{{quote|I had just finished filming ''[[Last of the Red Hot Lovers]]'' when Bob called me one day at home. \"Sally, do you want to be in my picture after next?\" he asked. \"Only if it's a good part,\" I said. He hung up on me.<br/>\nBob was as stubborn and arrogant as I was at the time, but the sad thing is that I cheated myself out of working with someone I loved so much, someone who made acting both fun and easy and who trusted his actors. Bob loved actors. Stars would line up to work for nothing for Bob Altman.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kellerman, Sally |title=Read My Lips: Stories of a Hollywood life |publisher=Weinstein Books |year=2013 |page=146}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Themes and subjects ===\nUnlike directors whose work fits within various [[film genre]]s, such as Westerns, musicals, war films, or comedies, Altman's work has been defined as more \"anti-genre\" by various critics.<ref name=Hillstrom/> This is partly due to the satirical and comedy nature of many of his films. [[Geraldine Chaplin]], daughter of [[Charlie Chaplin]], compared the humor in his films to her father's films:\n\n{{quote|They're funny in the right way. Funny in a critical way \u2014 of what the world is and the world we live in. They were both geniuses in their way. They alter your experience of reality. They have their world and they have their humor. That humor is so rare.<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|page=287}} }}\n\nAltman made it clear that he did not like \"storytelling\" in his films, contrary to the way most television and mainstream movies are made. According to Altman biographer [[Mitchell Zuckoff]], \"he disliked the word 'story,' believing that a plot should be secondary to an exploration of pure (or, even better, impure) human behavior.\"<ref name=Zuckoff>{{cite book |author=Zuckoff, Mitchell |title=Robert Altman: The oral biography |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |place=New York, NY |year=2009 |ISBN=978-0-307-26768-9}}</ref>{{rp|page=xiii}} Zuckoff describes the purposes underlying many of Altman's films: \"He loved the chaotic nature of real life, with conflicting perspectives, surprising twists, unexplained actions, and ambiguous endings. He especially loved many voices, sometimes arguing, sometimes agreeing, ideally overlapping, a cocktail party or a street scene captured as he experienced it.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=xiii}} [[Julianne Moore]], after seeing some of his movies, credits Altman's style of directing for her decision to become a film actress, rather than a stage actress:\n\n{{quote|I felt it really strongly. And I thought, \"I don't know who this guy is, but that's what I want to do. I want to do that kind of work.\" From then on I'd see his films whenever I could, and he was always my absolute favorite director, for what he said thematically and emotionally and how he felt about people.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=324}}}}\n\nFilm author Charles Derry writes that Altman's films \"characteristically contain perceptive observations, telling exchanges, and moments of crystal clear revelation of human folly.\"<ref name=Hillstrom/> Because Altman was an astute observer of society and \"especially interested in people,\" notes Derry, many of his film characters had \"that sloppy imperfection associated with human beings as they are, with life as it is lived.\"<ref name=Hillstrom /> As a result, his films are often an indirect critique of American society.\n\nFor many of Altman's films, the satirical content is evident: ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), for example, is a satirical black comedy set during the Korean War; ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971) is a satire on Westerns;<ref name=Wood>{{cite web |author=Wood, Robin |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/film/movie/contents/MASHed_marlowe_wood.pdf |title=Movie: A Journal of Film Criticism |id=2 |date=November 23, 1973}}</ref> author [[Matthew Kennedy (author)|Matthew Kennedy]] states that ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) is a \"brilliant satire of America immediately prior to the Bicentennial\";<ref>{{cite news |author=Kennedy, Matthew |url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/32/nashville.php#.UilBRNJJOSo |title=The Nashville Chronicles: The making of Robert Altman's masterpiece |series=book review |date=April 2001}}</ref> ''[[A Wedding]]'' (1978) is a satire on American marriage rituals and hypocrisy;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1023299-wedding/ |title=A Wedding |type=film review |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> Altman himself said that ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992) was \"a very mild satire\" about the Hollywood film industry, and [[Vincent Canby]] agreed, stating that \"as a satire, ''The Player'' tickles. It doesn't draw blood.\"<ref>{{cite news |author=Canby, Vincent |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE5DE1538F933A25757C0A964958260 |title=The Player |type=movie review |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 10, 1992}}</ref> However, the satire of his films sometimes led to their failure at the box office if their satirical nature was not understood by the distributor. Altman blames the box office failure of ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), a detective story, on the erroneous marketing of the film as a thriller:\n\n{{quote|When the picture opened, it was a big, big flop. ... I went to David Picker and said, \"You can't do this. No wonder the fucking picture is failing. It's giving the wrong impression. You make it look like a thriller and it's not, it's a satire.<ref name=Thompson/>}}\n\nSimilarly, Altman also blames the failure of ''[[O.C. & Stiggs]]'' on its being marketed as a typical \"teenage movie,\" rather than what he filmed it as, a \"satire of a teenage movie,\" he said.<ref name=Thompson />\n\n=== Improvisation and natural dialogue ===\nAltman favored stories expressing the interrelationships among several characters, being more interested in character motivation than in intricate plots. He therefore tended to sketch out only a basic plot for the film, referring to the screenplay as a \"blueprint\" for action. By encouraging his actors to improvise dialogue, Altman thus became known as an \"actor's director,\" a reputation that attracted many notable actors to work as part of his large casts. Performers enjoy working with Altman in part because \"he provides them with the freedom to develop their characters and often alter the script through improvisation and collaboration,\" notes Derry. [[Richard Baskin]] says that \"Bob was rather extraordinary in his way of letting people do what they did. He trusted you to do what you did and therefore you would kill for him.\"<ref name=Hillstrom />\n\n<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=282}} [[Geraldine Chaplin]], who acted in ''Nashville'', recalls one of her first rehearsal sessions:\n\n{{quote|He said, \"Have you brought your scripts?\" We said yes. He said, \"Well, throw them away. You don't need them. You need to know who you are and where you are and who you're with.\" ... It was like being onstage with a full house every second. All the circus acts you had inside your body you'd do just for him.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=282}}}}\n\nAltman regularly let his actors develop a character through improvisation during rehearsal or sometimes during the actual filming.<ref name=Armstrong>{{cite book |editor=Armstrong, Rick |title=Robert Altman: Critical essays |publisher=McFarland |year=2011 |pages=12, 21}}</ref> Such improvisation was uncommon in film due to the high cost of movie production which requires careful planning, precise scripts, and rehearsal, before costly film was exposed. Nevertheless, Altman preferred to use improvisation as a tool for helping his actors develop their character.<ref>{{cite book |author=Sterritt, David |title=Screening the Beats: Media culture and the beat sensibility |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |year=2004 |page=70}}</ref> Altman said that \"once we start shooting it's a very set thing. Improvisation is misunderstood. We don't just turn people loose.\"<ref name=Stevens>{{cite book |author=Stevens, George Jr. |title=Conversations at the American Film Institute with the Great Moviemakers |publisher=Random House |year=2012 |pages=3\u201316}}</ref> Although he tried to avoid dictating an actor's every move, preferring to let them be in control:\n\n{{quote|When I cast a film, most of my creative work is done. I have to be there to turn the switch on and give them encouragement as a father figure, but they do all the work. ... All I'm trying to do is make it easy on the actor, because once you start to shoot, the actor is the artist. ... I have to give them confidence and see that they have a certain amount of protection so they can be creative. ... I let them do what they became actors for in the first place: to create.<ref name=Stevens/>}}\n\n[[Carol Burnett]] remembers Altman admitting that many of the ideas in his films came from the actors. \"You never hear a director say that. That was truly an astonishing thing,\" she said.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=328}} Others, such as [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], became creatively driven:\n\n{{quote|He would inspire you out of sheer necessity to come up with stuff that you didn't know you were capable of, that you didn't know you had in you. He was so genuinely mischievous and so damn funny.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=435}}}}\n\nHe liked working with many of the same performers for other films, including [[Elliott Gould]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Keith Carradine]], [[Shelley Duvall]] and [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]. Krin Gabbard adds that Altman enjoyed using actors \"who flourish as improvisers,\" such as Elliott Gould, who starred in three of his films, ''MASH'', ''The Long Goodbye'' and ''California Split''.<ref name=Armstrong /> Gould recalls that when filming ''MASH'', his first acting job with Altman, he and costar [[Donald Sutherland]] didn't think Altman knew what he was doing. He wrote years later, \"I think that in hindsight, Donald and I were two elitist, arrogant actors who really weren't getting Altman's genius.\"<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=174}} Others in the cast immediately appreciated Altman's directing style. [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] explains:\n\n{{quote|We thought that's the way movies were. That they were that joyous an experience. If you had any kind of career, you quickly saw that most directors don't really trust actors, don't really want to see actors acting. That was the difference with Bob Altman. He loved actors and wanted to see acting.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=175}}}}\n\nUnlike television and traditional films, Altman also avoided \"conventional storytelling,\" and would opt for showing the \"busy confusion of real life,\" observes Albert Lindauer.<ref name=Wakeman/> Among the various techniques to achieve this effect, his films often include \"a profusion of sounds and images, by huge casts or crazy characters, multiple plots or no plots at all, ... and a reliance on improvisation.\"<ref name=Wakeman/> A few months before he died, Altman tried to summarize the motives behind his filmmaking style:\n\n{{quote|I equate this work more with painting than with theater or literature. Stories don't interest me. Basically, I'm more interested in behavior. I don't direct, I watch. I have to be thrilled if I expect the audience to be thrilled. Because what I really want to see from an actor is something I've never seen before, so I can't tell them what it is. I try to encourage actors not to take turns. To deal with conversation as conversation. I mean, that's what the job is, I think. It's to make a comfort area so that an actor can go beyond what he thought he could do.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=8}}}}\n\n[[Patricia Resnick]] often wrote his screenplays.\n\n=== Realistic sound and large ensemble casts ===\nAltman was one of the few filmmakers who \"paid full attention to the possibilities of sound\" when filming.<ref name=Freer /> He tried to replicate natural conversational sounds, even with large casts, by wiring hidden microphones to actors, then recording them talking over each other with multiple soundtracks.<ref name=Freer /> During the filming, he wore a headset to ensure that important dialogue could be heard, without emphasizing it. This produced a \"dense audio experience\" for viewers, allowing them to hear multiple scraps of dialogue, as if they were listening in on various private conversations. Altman recognized that although large casts hurt a film commercially, \"I like to see a lot of stuff going on.\"<ref name=Stevens/>\n\nAltman first used overlapping soundtracks in ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), a sound technique which movie author Michael Barson describes as \"a breathtaking innovation at the time.\"<ref name=Barson>{{cite book |author=Barson, Michael |title=The Illustrated Who's-Who of Hollywood Directors |publisher=Noonday Press |year=1995 |pages=12\u201315}}</ref> He developed it, Altman said, to force viewers to pay attention and become engaged in the film as if they were an active participant.<ref name=Wakeman/> According to some critics, one of the more extreme uses of the technique is in ''[[McCabe and Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), also considered among his finest films.<ref name=Hillstrom>{{cite book |editor=Hillstrom, Laurie Collier |title=International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers |volume=2 |publisher=St. James Press |year=1997 |pages=12\u201317}}</ref>\n\nHowever, overlapping dialogue among large groups of actors adds complexity to Altman's films, and they were often criticized as appearing haphazard or disconnected on first viewing. Some of his critics, however, changed their mind after seeing them again. British film critic, [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], gave ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) a bad review after watching it the first time, but later wrote, \"But going back to ''Nashville'' and some of the earlier films, ... made me reflect: It remains enigmatic how organized or purposeful ''Nashville'' is. ... The mosaic, or mix, permits a freedom and a human idiosyncrasy that [[Jean Renoir|Renoir]] might have admired.\"<ref name=Thomson>{{cite book |author=Thomson, David |title=The New Biographical Dictionary of Film |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |place=New York, N.Y. |year=2002 |pages=13\u201314}}</ref> During the making of the film, the actors were inspired, and co-star [[Ronee Blakley]] was convinced of the film's ultimate success:\n\n{{quote|Yes, I did think it was going to be great, all the work was so good, every actor was inspired, and Altman's team was intensely competent, and he was that rare kind of genius who knows what works and what doesn't at the moment it is happening.<ref>[http://blogs.indiewire.com/mediamatrix/00000142-1f59-d3e8-a77e-1ffb2ab80000 \"Ronee Blakley Reflects About Robert Altman's epic film 'Nashville'\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117054947/http://blogs.indiewire.com/mediamatrix/00000142-1f59-d3e8-a77e-1ffb2ab80000 |date=November 17, 2013 }}, ''Indiewire'', Nov. 3, 2013</ref>}}\n\nThomson later recognized those aspects as being part of Altman's style, beginning with ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970): \"''MASH'' began to develop the crucial Altman style of overlapping, blurred sound and images so slippery with zoom that there was no sense of composition. That is what makes ''Nashville'' so absorbing.\"<ref name=Thomson/> Altman explained that to him such overlapping dialogue in his films was closer to reality, especially with large groups: \"If you've got fourteen people at a dinner table, it seems to me it's pretty unlikely that only two of them are going to be talking.\"<ref name=Stevens/> [[Pauline Kael]] writes that Altman, \"the master of large ensembles, loose action, and overlapping voices, demonstrates that ... he can make film fireworks out of next to nothing.\"<ref name=Wakeman/>\n\n=== Photography ===\nAltman's distinctive style of directing carried over into his preferences for camerawork. Among them was his use of widescreen compositions, intended to capture the many people or activities taking place on screen at the same time. For some films, such as ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'', he created a powerful visual atmosphere with cinematographer [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], such as scenes using fluid camerawork, zoom lenses, and a smoky effect using special fog filters.<ref name=Frost>{{cite book |author=Frost, Jacqueline B. |title=Cinematography for Directors: A guide for creative collaboration |publisher=Michael Wiese Productions |year=2009 |pages=46, 221}}</ref> Director [[Stanley Kubrick]] told Altman that \"the camerawork was wonderful,\" and asked, \"How did you do it?\"<ref name=Rogers/>\n\nIn ''Nashville'', Altman used sets with noticeable colors of reds, whites and blues. For ''The Long Goodbye'', he insisted that Zsigmond keep the camera mobile by mounting it to moving objects.<ref name=Hillstrom/> Zsigmond states that Altman \"wanted to do something different\" in this film, and told him he \"wanted the camera to move \u2014 all the time. Up. down. In and out. Side to side.\"<ref name=Rogers/> Cinematographer [[Roger Deakins]], discussing his use of zoom lenses, commented, \"I would find it quite exciting to shoot a film with a zoom lens if it was that observational, roving kind of look that Robert Altman was known for. He'd put the camera on a jib arm and float across the scene and pick out these shots as he went along \u2013 quite a nice way of working.\"<ref name=Frost/>\n\nZsigmond also recalls that working with Altman was fun:\n\n{{quote|We rather enjoyed doing things \"improv.\" Altman is a great improviser. During the first few days of the shoot, he would \"create\" different approaches on a moment's notice. He would show me how he wanted the camera to move \u2014 always move. Which was fun. The actors loved it, and I was always challenged to find ways to shoot what Altman came up with.<ref name=Rogers>{{cite book |author=Rogers, Pauline S. |title=More Contemporary Cinematographers on Their Art |publisher=Focal Press |year=2000 |pages=178\u2013179}}</ref>}}\n\nVilmos Zsigmond's cinematography in ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' received a nomination by the [[British Academy Film Awards]].\n\n=== Music scores ===\nWhen using music in his films, Altman was known to be highly selective, often choosing music that he personally liked. Director [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], who worked with him, notes that \"Altman's use of music is always important,\" adding, \"Bob loved his music, didn't he? My God, he loved his music\".<ref name=Armstrong/> Since he was a \"great fan\" of [[Leonard Cohen]]'s music, for example, saying he would \"just get stoned and play that stuff\" all the time<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |editor=Thompson, David |title=Altman on Altman |publisher=Faber & Faber |year=2010 |edition=ebook}}</ref> he used three of his songs in ''[[McCabe and Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), and another for the final scene in ''[[A Wedding]]'' (1978).<ref>{{cite book |author=Simmons, Sylvie |title=I'm Your Man: The life of Leonard Cohen |publisher=Random House |year=2012 |at=Chapter&nbsp;13}}</ref>\n\nFor ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), Altman had numerous new country music songs written by his cast to create a realistic atmosphere. He incorporated a \"hauntingly repeated melody\" in ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), and employed [[Harry Nilsson]] and [[Van Dyke Parks]] to score ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' (1980).<ref name=McGilligan/>{{rp|page=347}}\n\nA number of music experts have written about Altman's use of music, including Richard R.

Altman''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0254\u02d0|l|t|m|\u0259|n}}; February 20, 1925 \u2013 November 20, 2006) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. Altman is known as five-time nominee of the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and an enduring figure from the [[New Hollywood]] era with such directors as [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Sidney Lumet]], and [[David Lynch]]. Altman was considered a \"maverick\" in making [[Cinema of the United States|films]] with a highly naturalistic but stylized  and satirical aesthetic, unlike most Hollywood films. He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema.\n\nHis style of filmmaking covered many genres, but usually with a \"[[subversion|subversive]]\" twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views. Altman developed a reputation for being \"anti-Hollywood\" and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style. However, actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise, thereby inspiring their own creativity.\n\nHe preferred large [[ensemble cast]]s for his films, and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors. This produced a more natural, more dynamic, and more complex experience for the viewer. He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen. Critic [[Pauline Kael]], writing about his directing style, said that Altman could \"make film fireworks out of next to nothing.\"<ref name=Wakeman /> Altman's most famous directorial achievements include, ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H*]]'' (1970), ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), ''[[3 Women]]'' (1977), ''[[Secret Honor]]'' (1984), ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992), ''[[Short Cuts]]'' (1993), and ''[[Gosford Park]]'' (2001). \n\nIn 2006, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] recognized Altman's body of work with an [[Academy Honorary Award]]. He never won a competitive Oscar despite seven nominations. His films ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), and ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) have been selected for the United States [[National Film Registry]]. Altman is one of three filmmakers whose films have won the [[Golden Bear]] at [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], the [[Golden Lion]] at [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]], and the [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm]] at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] (the other two being [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]], and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]).\n\n== Early life and career ==\nAltman was born on February 20, 1925, in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], the son of Helen (n\u00e9e Matthews), a ''[[Mayflower]]'' descendant from [[Nebraska]], and Bernard Clement Altman, a wealthy insurance salesman and amateur gambler, who came from an upper-class family. Altman's ancestry was German, English and Irish;<ref name=\"altman3\">{{cite news |last=Lemons |first=Stephen |title=Robert Altman |page=2 |work=Salon.com |url=http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2000/08/15/altman/index.html |accessdate=November 22, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208024334/http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2000/08/15/altman/index.html |archivedate=December 8, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"altman1\">{{cite news |last=The Daily Telegraph |title=Robert Altman, 81, Mercurial Director of Masterworks and Flops |newspaper=The New York Sun |date=November 22, 2006 |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/44018 |accessdate=November 22, 2006 }}</ref> his paternal grandfather, Frank Altman, Sr., anglicized the spelling of the family name from \"Altmann\" to \"Altman\".<ref name=\"altman1\" /> Altman had a Catholic upbringing,<ref name=\"altman2\">{{cite web |title=The Religious Affiliation of Robert Altman |publisher=Adherents.com |date=July 28, 2005 |url =http://www.adherents.com/people/pa/Robert_Altman.html |accessdate=November 22, 2006 }}</ref> but he did not continue to follow or practice the religion as an adult,<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/may/01/features.weekend \"Interview: Robert Altman\"], ''The Guardian''</ref> although he has been referred to as \"a sort of Catholic\" and a Catholic director.<ref name=\"altman2\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholichistory.net/Spotlights/SpotlightMovies.htm |title=Spotlight: Catholics at the Movies |publisher=Catholichistory.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref> He was educated at [[Jesuit]] schools, including [[Rockhurst High School]], in Kansas City.<ref>{{cite news |author=Butler, Robert W. |date=March 5, 2006 |title=Finally, An Attitude Adjustment: Hollywood's Establishment Now Embraces Rebel Director Altman |newspaper=[[The Kansas City Star]] |page=5 }}</ref> He graduated from [[Wentworth Military Academy]] in [[Lexington, Missouri]] in 1943.\n\nIn 1943, Altman joined the [[United States Army Air Forces]] at the age of 18. During [[World War II]], Altman flew more than 50 bombing missions as a crewman on a [[B-24 Liberator]] with the 307th Bomb Group in [[Borneo]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref name=\"altm\">{{cite web |year=2011 |url=http://www.b24bestweb.com/b24bestweb-Famous.htm|title = Famous B-24/PB4Y Crew Members |publisher=B-24 Best Web |accessdate=July 25, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nUpon his discharge in 1946, Altman moved to California. He worked in publicity for a company that had invented a [[tattoo]]ing machine to identify dogs. He entered filmmaking on a whim, selling a script to [[RKO]] for the 1948 picture ''[[Bodyguard (1948 film)|Bodyguard]]'', which he co-wrote with George W. George. Altman's immediate success encouraged him to move to [[New York City]], where he attempted to forge a career as a writer. Having enjoyed little success, in 1949 he returned to Kansas City, where he accepted a job as a director and writer of industrial films for the [[Calvin Company]]. In February 2012, an early Calvin film directed by Altman, ''Modern Football'' (1951), was found by filmmaker Gary Huggins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2012/03/fan-uncovers-robert-altmans-first-film/1 |title=Fan uncovers Robert Altman's first film |publisher=Content.usatoday.com |date=2012-03-14 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcook/2012/03/13/robert-altmans-lost-classic-modern-football/ |title=Robert Altman's Lost Classic: 'Modern Football' |magazine=Forbes |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref>\n\nAltman directed some 65 industrial films and documentaries before being hired by a local businessman in 1956 to write and direct a feature film in Kansas City on [[juvenile delinquency]]. The film, titled ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', made for $60,000, was purchased by [[United Artists]] for $150,000, and released in 1957. While primitive, this teen [[exploitation film]] contained the foundations of Altman's later work in its use of casual, naturalistic dialogue. With its success, Altman moved from Kansas City to California for the last time. He co-directed ''[[The James Dean Story]]'' (1957), a documentary rushed into theaters to capitalize on the actor's recent death and marketed to his emerging cult following.\n\n== Television work ==\nAltman's first forays into TV directing were on the [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] drama series ''[[Pulse of the City]]'' (1953\u20131954), and an episode of the 1956 western series ''[[The Sheriff of Cochise]]''. After [[Alfred Hitchcock]] saw Altman's early features ''The Delinquents'' and ''The James Dean Story'', he hired him as a director for his [[CBS]] anthology series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. After just two episodes, Altman resigned due to differences with a producer, but this exposure enabled him to forge a successful TV career. Over the next decade Altman worked prolifically in television (and almost exclusively in series dramas) directing multiple episodes of ''[[Whirlybirds]]'', ''[[The Millionaire (TV series)|The Millionaire]]'', ''[[U.S. Marshal (TV series)|U.S. Marshal]]'', ''[[The Troubleshooters (1959 TV series)|The Troubleshooters]]'', ''[[The Roaring 20s (TV series)|The Roaring 20s]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'', ''[[Kraft Mystery Theater]]'',  ''[[Combat!]]'', as well as single episodes of several other notable series including ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (the fourth season episode [[List of Maverick episodes|\"Bolt From the Blue\"]] also written by Altman and starring [[Roger Moore]]), ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', ''[[Surfside 6]]'', ''[[Peter Gunn]]'', and ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.\n\nThrough this early work on industrial films and TV series, Altman experimented with narrative technique and developed his characteristic use of overlapping dialogue. He also learned to work quickly and efficiently on a limited budget. Though he was frequently fired from TV projects for refusing to conform to network mandates, as well as insisting on expressing political subtexts and antiwar sentiments during the Vietnam years, Altman always was able to land new assignments. In 1964, the producers decided to expand \"Once Upon a Savage Night\", one of his episodes of ''[[Kraft Suspense Theatre]]'', for release as a TV movie under the title ''[[Nightmare in Chicago]]''.\n\nTwo years later, Altman was hired to direct the low-budget space travel feature ''[[Countdown (1968 film)|Countdown]]'', but was fired within days of the project's conclusion because he had refused to edit the film to a manageable length. He did not direct another film until ''[[That Cold Day in the Park]]'' (1969), which was a critical and box-office disaster.\n\n== Mainstream success ==\n\nIn 1969, Altman was offered the script for ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'', an adaptation of a little-known [[Korean War]]-era novel satirizing life in the armed services; more than a dozen other filmmakers had passed on it. Altman had been hesitant to take the production, and the shoot was so tumultuous that [[Elliott Gould]] and [[Donald Sutherland]] tried to have Altman fired over his unorthodox filming methods. Nevertheless, ''MASH'' was widely hailed as an immediate classic upon its 1970 release. It won the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' at the 1970 [[Cannes Film Festival]] and netted five [[Academy Award]] nominations. It was Altman's highest-grossing film, released during a time of increasing anti-war sentiment in the United States. The [[Academy Film Archive]] preserved ''MASH'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=M*A*S*H&filmmaker=&category=All&collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\nNow recognized as a major talent, Altman notched critical successes with ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), a [[Revisionist Western]] in which the mordant songs of [[Leonard Cohen]] underscore a gritty vision of the American frontier; ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), a controversial adaptation of the [[Raymond Chandler]] novel (scripted by [[Leigh Brackett]]) now ranked as a seminal influence on the [[neo-noir]] subgenre; ''[[Thieves Like Us (film)|Thieves Like Us]]'' (1974), an adaptation of the Edward Anderson novel previously filmed by [[Nicholas Ray]] as ''[[They Live by Night]]'' (1949); ''[[California Split]]'' (1974), a gambling comedy-drama shot partially on location in [[Reno, Nevada]]; and ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), which had a strong political theme set against the world of [[country music]]. The stars of the film wrote their own songs; [[Keith Carradine]] won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for the song \"[[I'm Easy (Keith Carradine song)|I'm Easy]]\". Although his films were often met with divisive notices, many of the prominent film critics of the era (including [[Pauline Kael]], [[Vincent Canby]] and [[Roger Ebert]]) remained steadfastly loyal to his oeuvre throughout the decade.\n\nAudiences took some time to appreciate his films, and he did not want to have to satisfy studio officials. In 1970, following the release of ''MASH,'' he founded Lion's Gate Films to have independent production freedom. Altman's company is not to be confused with the current [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]], a Canada/U.S. entertainment company.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cook |first=David A. |date=2000 |title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in the Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam, 1970\u20131979 |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-23265-8 |page=97}}</ref> The films he made through his company included ''[[Brewster McCloud]]'', ''[[A Wedding]]'', ''[[3 Women]]'', and ''[[Quintet (film)|Quintet]]''.\n\n== Later career and renaissance ==\n[[File:Robert Altman - 1976.jpg|thumb|left|Altman with [[Lillian Gish]] and [[Lily Tomlin]] at ''Nashville'' awards ceremony in 1976]]\nIn 1980, he directed the musical film ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]''. Produced by [[Robert Evans (film producer)|Robert Evans]] and written by [[Jules Feiffer]], the film was based on the comic strip / cartoon [[Popeye|of the same name]] and starred the comedian [[Robin Williams]] in his film debut. Designed as a vehicle to increase Altman's commercial clout following a series of critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful low-budget films in the late 1970s (including ''3&nbsp;Women'', ''A&nbsp;Wedding'' and ''Quintet''), the production was filmed on location in [[Malta]]. It was soon beleaguered by heavy drug and alcohol use among most of the cast and crew, including the director; Altman reportedly clashed with Evans, Williams (who threatened to leave the film), and songwriter [[Harry Nilsson]] (who departed midway through the shoot, leaving [[Van Dyke Parks]] to finish the orchestrations). Although the film grossed $60&nbsp;million worldwide on a $20&nbsp;million budget and was the second highest-grossing film Altman had directed to that point, it failed to meet studio expectations and was considered a box office disappointment.\n\nIn 1981, the director sold Lion's Gate to producer [[Jonathan Taplin]] after his political satire ''[[Health (film)|Health]]'' (shot in early 1979 for a Christmas release) was shelved by longtime distributor [[20th Century Fox]] following tepid test and festival screenings throughout 1980. The departure of longtime Altman partisan [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] from Fox also played a decisive role in forestalling the release of the film.\n\nUnable to secure major financing in the post-New Hollywood [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] era because of his mercurial reputation and the particularly tumultuous events surrounding the production of ''Popeye'', Altman began to \"direct literate dramatic properties on shoestring budgets for stage, home video, television, and limited theatrical release,\" including the acclaimed ''[[Secret Honor]]'' and ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'', a critically antipodean adaptation of a play that Altman had directed on Broadway.<ref name=McGilligan>{{cite book |author=McGilligan, Patrick |title=Robert Altman: Jumping off the cliff |publisher=Macmillan |year=1989}}</ref>{{rp|page=115}}\n\nIn 1982, Altman staged a production of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' at the [[University of Michigan]], where he concurrently taught a course on his films. Shortly thereafter, he returned to film ''Secret Honor'' with students. In 2008, the University of Michigan Library acquired Altman's archive.<ref name=ManyHatsUMich>{{cite web |url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/online-exhibits/exhibits/show/altman/opera-and-the-university-of-mi |title=Altman at the University of Michigan |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] |series=The many hats of Robert Altman: A life in cinema |type=online exhibit}}</ref> He also co-wrote [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s 1983 hit single \"[[Black Sheep (John Anderson song)|Black Sheep]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1546370/nashville-director-robert-altman-dies.jhtml |title=Nashville director Robert Altman dies |date=21 November 2006 |work=[[Country Music Television]] |accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[teen comedy]] ''[[O.C. and Stiggs]]'' (1985), an abortive return to Hollywood filmmaking retrospectively characterized by the [[British Film Institute]] as \"probably Altman's least successful film\", received a belated limited commercial release in 1987 after being shelved by [[MGM]].\n\nAdapted by Altman and [[Sam Shepard]] for [[The Cannon Group]] from the latter's [[Pulitzer Prize]]-nominated play, ''[[Fool for Love (film)|Fool for Love]]'' (1985) featured the playwright-actor alongside [[Kim Basinger]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], and [[Randy Quaid]]; it fared better than most of his films from the era, earning $900,000 domestically on a $2&nbsp;million budget and positive reviews from [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Vincent Canby]]. Still, widespread popularity with audiences continued to elude him.\n\nHe continued to regain a modicum of critical favor for his television [[mockumentary]] ''[[Tanner '88]]'' (1988), a collaboration with [[Garry Trudeau]] set in the milieu of a United States presidential campaign, for which he earned a [[Primetime Emmy Award]].\n\nIn 1990, Altman directed ''[[Vincent & Theo]]'', a [[biopic]] about [[Vincent van Gogh]] that was intended as a television miniseries for broadcast in the United Kingdom. A theatrical version of the film was a modest success in the United States, marking a significant turning point in the director's critical resurgence.{{efn|Powerfully realized study of [[Vincent van Gogh]] and his brother Theo marks a return to the mainstream arena for director Robert Altman.

Co-produced by the influential [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] (''[[The Sting]]'', ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]''), the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. While he did not win the Oscar, he was awarded Best Director by the [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[BAFTA]], and the [[New York Film Critics Circle]].\n\nAltman then directed ''[[Short Cuts (film)|Short Cuts]]'' (1993), an ambitious adaptation of several short stories by [[Raymond Carver]], which portrayed the lives of various citizens of Los Angeles over the course of several days. The film's large cast and intertwining of many different storylines were similar to his large-cast films of the 1970s; he won the [[Golden Lion]] at the 1993 [[Venice International Film Festival]] and another Oscar nomination for Best Director. In 1996, Altman directed ''[[Kansas City (1996 film)|Kansas City]]'', expressing his love of 1930s jazz through a complicated kidnapping story. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1999.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web |title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter&nbsp;A |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''[[Gosford Park]]'' (2001), a large-cast, British country house [[murder mystery]], was included on many critics' lists of the ten best films of that year. It won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay ([[Julian Fellowes]]) plus six more nominations, including two for Altman, as Best Director and Best Picture.\n\nWorking with independent studios such as the now-shuttered Fine Line, Artisan (which was absorbed into today's [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]]), and USA Films (now [[Focus Features]]), gave Altman the edge in making the kinds of films he always wanted to make without studio interference. A [[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|film version]] of [[Garrison Keillor]]'s public radio series ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' was released in June&nbsp;2006. Altman was still developing new projects up until his death, including a film based on ''[[Hands on a Hard Body: The Documentary]]'' (1997).<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=19678 |title=Robert Altman has a hard body |magazine=Empire}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded Altman an [[Academy Honorary Award]] for Lifetime Achievement. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that he had received a heart transplant approximately ten or eleven years earlier. The director then quipped that perhaps the Academy had acted prematurely in recognizing the body of his work, as he felt like he might have four more decades of life ahead of him.\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Family ===\nAltman was married three times. His first wife was LaVonne Elmer. They were married from 1947 to 1949, and had a daughter, Christine. His second wife was Lotus Corelli. They were married from 1950 to 1955, and had two sons, Michael and Stephen. At fourteen, Michael wrote the lyrics to \"[[Suicide Is Painless]]\", the theme song to Altman's movie, ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]''. Steven is a [[production designer]] who often worked with his father. Altman's third wife was Kathryn Reed. They were married from 1957 until his death in 2006. They had two sons, Robert and Matthew.

He moved his family and business headquarters to New York City, but eventually moved back to Malibu, where he lived until his death. Altman despised the television series ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' which followed his 1970 film, citing it as being the antithesis of what his movie was about, and citing its anti-war messages as being \"racist\". In the 2001 DVD commentary for ''MASH'', he stated clearly the reasons for which he disapproved of the series.{{clarify|and what were they?|date=September 2019}}{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Political views ===\nIn November&nbsp;2000, Altman claimed that he would move to Paris if [[George W.

He understood the creative limits imposed by the television genre, and now set out to direct and write films which would express his personal visions about American society and Hollywood. His films would later be described as \"[[auteur]]istic attacks\" and \"idiosyncratic variations\" of traditional films, typically using subtle comedy or satire as a way of expressing his observations.<ref name=Wakeman>John Wakeman, ed. ''World Film Directors \u2013 Vol. 2'', H. W. Wilson Co., N.Y. (1988) pp. 29\u201339</ref>\n\nHis films were typically related to political, ideological, and personal subjects, and Altman was known for \"refusing to compromise his own artistic vision.\"<ref name=Hillstrom /> He has been described as \"anti-Hollywood,\" often ignoring the social pressures that affected others in the industry, which made it more difficult for him to get many of his films seen. However, he still felt that his independence as a filmmaker did him little harm overall:\n\n{{quote|I don't think there's a filmmaker alive, or who ever lived, who's had a better shake than I've had. I've never been without a project and it's always been a project of my own choosing. So I don't know how much better it could be. I have not become a mogul, I don't build castles and I don't have a vast personal fortune, but I have been able to do what I've wanted to do and I've done it a lot.<ref name=Stevens />}}\n\n\"Altman was a genuine movie maverick,\" states author [[Ian Freer]], because he went against the commercial conformity of the movie industry: \"He was the scourge of the film establishment, and his work generally cast an astute, scathing eye over the breadth of American culture, often exploding genres and character archetypes; Altman was fascinated by people with imperfections, people as they really are, not as the movies would have you believe.\"<ref name=Freer>{{cite book |author=Freer, Ian |title=Moviemakers |publisher=Quercus |place=London, UK |year=2009 |pages=106\u2013109}}</ref> Director [[Alan Rudolph]], during a special tribute to Altman, refers to his moviemaking style as \"Altmanesque.\"<ref name=NYT-07>{{cite news |author=Carr, David |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/movies/21altman.html?_r=0 |title=A very Altmanesque tribute to Altman |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 21, 2007}}</ref>\n\nWith his independent style of directing, he developed a bad reputation among screenwriters and those on the business side of films. He admits, \"I have a bad reputation with writers, developed over the years: 'Oh, he doesn't do what you write, blah blah blah.' ... [[Ring Lardner, Jr.|Ring Lardner]] was very pissed off with me,\" for not following his script.<ref name=Thompson/>{{rp|page=18}} Nor did Altman get along well with studio heads, once punching an executive in the nose and knocking him into a swimming pool because he insisted he cut six minutes from a film he was working on.<ref name=Armstrong/>{{rp|page=9}}\n\nHis reputation among actors is quite different, however. With them, his independence sometimes extended to his choice of actors, often going against consensus. [[Cher]], for instance, credits him for launching her career with both the stage play and film, ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'' (1982). \"Without Bob I would have never had a film career. Everyone told him not to cast me. Everyone. ... Nobody would give me a break. I am convinced that Bob was the only one who was brave enough to do it.\" Others, like [[Julianne Moore]], describes working with him:\n\n{{quote|You know, all this talk about Bob being this kind of irascible, difficult kind of person? Well, he was never that way with an actor or with a creative person that I saw. Never, never, never. He saved all that for the money people.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=431}}}}\n\nHowever, director [[Robert Dornhelm]] states, Altman \"looked at film as a pure, artistic venue.\" With ''[[Short Cuts (film)|Short Cuts]]'' (1993), for instance, the distributor \"begged him\" to cut a few minutes from the length, to keep it commercially viable: \"Bob just thought the Antichrist was trying to destroy his art. They were well-meaning people who wanted him to get what he deserved, which was a big commercial hit. But when it came down to the art or the money, he was with the art.\"<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|page=438}}\n\n[[Sally Kellerman]], noting Altman's willful attitude, still looks back with regret at giving up a chance to act in one of his films:\n\n{{quote|I had just finished filming ''[[Last of the Red Hot Lovers]]'' when Bob called me one day at home. \"Sally, do you want to be in my picture after next?\" he asked. \"Only if it's a good part,\" I said. He hung up on me.<br/>\nBob was as stubborn and arrogant as I was at the time, but the sad thing is that I cheated myself out of working with someone I loved so much, someone who made acting both fun and easy and who trusted his actors. Bob loved actors. Stars would line up to work for nothing for Bob Altman.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kellerman, Sally |title=Read My Lips: Stories of a Hollywood life |publisher=Weinstein Books |year=2013 |page=146}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Themes and subjects ===\nUnlike directors whose work fits within various [[film genre]]s, such as Westerns, musicals, war films, or comedies, Altman's work has been defined as more \"anti-genre\" by various critics.<ref name=Hillstrom/> This is partly due to the satirical and comedy nature of many of his films. [[Geraldine Chaplin]], daughter of [[Charlie Chaplin]], compared the humor in his films to her father's films:\n\n{{quote|They're funny in the right way. Funny in a critical way \u2014 of what the world is and the world we live in. They were both geniuses in their way. They alter your experience of reality. They have their world and they have their humor. That humor is so rare.<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|page=287}} }}\n\nAltman made it clear that he did not like \"storytelling\" in his films, contrary to the way most television and mainstream movies are made. According to Altman biographer [[Mitchell Zuckoff]], \"he disliked the word 'story,' believing that a plot should be secondary to an exploration of pure (or, even better, impure) human behavior.\"<ref name=Zuckoff>{{cite book |author=Zuckoff, Mitchell |title=Robert Altman: The oral biography |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |place=New York, NY |year=2009 |ISBN=978-0-307-26768-9}}</ref>{{rp|page=xiii}} Zuckoff describes the purposes underlying many of Altman's films: \"He loved the chaotic nature of real life, with conflicting perspectives, surprising twists, unexplained actions, and ambiguous endings. He especially loved many voices, sometimes arguing, sometimes agreeing, ideally overlapping, a cocktail party or a street scene captured as he experienced it.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=xiii}} [[Julianne Moore]], after seeing some of his movies, credits Altman's style of directing for her decision to become a film actress, rather than a stage actress:\n\n{{quote|I felt it really strongly. And I thought, \"I don't know who this guy is, but that's what I want to do. I want to do that kind of work.\" From then on I'd see his films whenever I could, and he was always my absolute favorite director, for what he said thematically and emotionally and how he felt about people.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=324}}}}\n\nFilm author Charles Derry writes that Altman's films \"characteristically contain perceptive observations, telling exchanges, and moments of crystal clear revelation of human folly.\"<ref name=Hillstrom/> Because Altman was an astute observer of society and \"especially interested in people,\" notes Derry, many of his film characters had \"that sloppy imperfection associated with human beings as they are, with life as it is lived.\"<ref name=Hillstrom /> As a result, his films are often an indirect critique of American society.\n\nFor many of Altman's films, the satirical content is evident: ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), for example, is a satirical black comedy set during the Korean War; ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971) is a satire on Westerns;<ref name=Wood>{{cite web |author=Wood, Robin |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/film/movie/contents/MASHed_marlowe_wood.pdf |title=Movie: A Journal of Film Criticism |id=2 |date=November 23, 1973}}</ref> author [[Matthew Kennedy (author)|Matthew Kennedy]] states that ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) is a \"brilliant satire of America immediately prior to the Bicentennial\";<ref>{{cite news |author=Kennedy, Matthew |url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/32/nashville.php#.UilBRNJJOSo |title=The Nashville Chronicles: The making of Robert Altman's masterpiece |series=book review |date=April 2001}}</ref> ''[[A Wedding]]'' (1978) is a satire on American marriage rituals and hypocrisy;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1023299-wedding/ |title=A Wedding |type=film review |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> Altman himself said that ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992) was \"a very mild satire\" about the Hollywood film industry, and [[Vincent Canby]] agreed, stating that \"as a satire, ''The Player'' tickles. It doesn't draw blood.\"<ref>{{cite news |author=Canby, Vincent |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE5DE1538F933A25757C0A964958260 |title=The Player |type=movie review |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 10, 1992}}</ref> However, the satire of his films sometimes led to their failure at the box office if their satirical nature was not understood by the distributor. Altman blames the box office failure of ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), a detective story, on the erroneous marketing of the film as a thriller:\n\n{{quote|When the picture opened, it was a big, big flop. ... I went to David Picker and said, \"You can't do this. No wonder the fucking picture is failing. It's giving the wrong impression. You make it look like a thriller and it's not, it's a satire.<ref name=Thompson/>}}\n\nSimilarly, Altman also blames the failure of ''[[O.C. & Stiggs]]'' on its being marketed as a typical \"teenage movie,\" rather than what he filmed it as, a \"satire of a teenage movie,\" he said.<ref name=Thompson />\n\n=== Improvisation and natural dialogue ===\nAltman favored stories expressing the interrelationships among several characters, being more interested in character motivation than in intricate plots. He therefore tended to sketch out only a basic plot for the film, referring to the screenplay as a \"blueprint\" for action. By encouraging his actors to improvise dialogue, Altman thus became known as an \"actor's director,\" a reputation that attracted many notable actors to work as part of his large casts. Performers enjoy working with Altman in part because \"he provides them with the freedom to develop their characters and often alter the script through improvisation and collaboration,\" notes Derry. [[Richard Baskin]] says that \"Bob was rather extraordinary in his way of letting people do what they did. He trusted you to do what you did and therefore you would kill for him.\"<ref name=Hillstrom />\n\n<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=282}} [[Geraldine Chaplin]], who acted in ''Nashville'', recalls one of her first rehearsal sessions:\n\n{{quote|He said, \"Have you brought your scripts?\" We said yes. He said, \"Well, throw them away. You don't need them. You need to know who you are and where you are and who you're with.\" ... It was like being onstage with a full house every second. All the circus acts you had inside your body you'd do just for him.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=282}}}}\n\nAltman regularly let his actors develop a character through improvisation during rehearsal or sometimes during the actual filming.<ref name=Armstrong>{{cite book |editor=Armstrong, Rick |title=Robert Altman: Critical essays |publisher=McFarland |year=2011 |pages=12, 21}}</ref> Such improvisation was uncommon in film due to the high cost of movie production which requires careful planning, precise scripts, and rehearsal, before costly film was exposed. Nevertheless, Altman preferred to use improvisation as a tool for helping his actors develop their character.<ref>{{cite book |author=Sterritt, David |title=Screening the Beats: Media culture and the beat sensibility |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |year=2004 |page=70}}</ref> Altman said that \"once we start shooting it's a very set thing. Improvisation is misunderstood. We don't just turn people loose.\"<ref name=Stevens>{{cite book |author=Stevens, George Jr. |title=Conversations at the American Film Institute with the Great Moviemakers |publisher=Random House |year=2012 |pages=3\u201316}}</ref> Although he tried to avoid dictating an actor's every move, preferring to let them be in control:\n\n{{quote|When I cast a film, most of my creative work is done. I have to be there to turn the switch on and give them encouragement as a father figure, but they do all the work. ... All I'm trying to do is make it easy on the actor, because once you start to shoot, the actor is the artist. ... I have to give them confidence and see that they have a certain amount of protection so they can be creative. ... I let them do what they became actors for in the first place: to create.<ref name=Stevens/>}}\n\n[[Carol Burnett]] remembers Altman admitting that many of the ideas in his films came from the actors. \"You never hear a director say that. That was truly an astonishing thing,\" she said.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=328}} Others, such as [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], became creatively driven:\n\n{{quote|He would inspire you out of sheer necessity to come up with stuff that you didn't know you were capable of, that you didn't know you had in you. He was so genuinely mischievous and so damn funny.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=435}}}}\n\nHe liked working with many of the same performers for other films, including [[Elliott Gould]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Keith Carradine]], [[Shelley Duvall]] and [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]. Krin Gabbard adds that Altman enjoyed using actors \"who flourish as improvisers,\" such as Elliott Gould, who starred in three of his films, ''MASH'', ''The Long Goodbye'' and ''California Split''.<ref name=Armstrong /> Gould recalls that when filming ''MASH'', his first acting job with Altman, he and costar [[Donald Sutherland]] didn't think Altman knew what he was doing. He wrote years later, \"I think that in hindsight, Donald and I were two elitist, arrogant actors who really weren't getting Altman's genius.\"<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=174}} Others in the cast immediately appreciated Altman's directing style. [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] explains:\n\n{{quote|We thought that's the way movies were. That they were that joyous an experience. If you had any kind of career, you quickly saw that most directors don't really trust actors, don't really want to see actors acting. That was the difference with Bob Altman. He loved actors and wanted to see acting.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=175}}}}\n\nUnlike television and traditional films, Altman also avoided \"conventional storytelling,\" and would opt for showing the \"busy confusion of real life,\" observes Albert Lindauer.<ref name=Wakeman/> Among the various techniques to achieve this effect, his films often include \"a profusion of sounds and images, by huge casts or crazy characters, multiple plots or no plots at all, ... and a reliance on improvisation.\"<ref name=Wakeman/> A few months before he died, Altman tried to summarize the motives behind his filmmaking style:\n\n{{quote|I equate this work more with painting than with theater or literature. Stories don't interest me. Basically, I'm more interested in behavior. I don't direct, I watch. I have to be thrilled if I expect the audience to be thrilled. Because what I really want to see from an actor is something I've never seen before, so I can't tell them what it is. I try to encourage actors not to take turns. To deal with conversation as conversation. I mean, that's what the job is, I think. It's to make a comfort area so that an actor can go beyond what he thought he could do.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=8}}}}\n\n[[Patricia Resnick]] often wrote his screenplays.\n\n=== Realistic sound and large ensemble casts ===\nAltman was one of the few filmmakers who \"paid full attention to the possibilities of sound\" when filming.<ref name=Freer /> He tried to replicate natural conversational sounds, even with large casts, by wiring hidden microphones to actors, then recording them talking over each other with multiple soundtracks.<ref name=Freer /> During the filming, he wore a headset to ensure that important dialogue could be heard, without emphasizing it. This produced a \"dense audio experience\" for viewers, allowing them to hear multiple scraps of dialogue, as if they were listening in on various private conversations. Altman recognized that although large casts hurt a film commercially, \"I like to see a lot of stuff going on.\"<ref name=Stevens/>\n\nAltman first used overlapping soundtracks in ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), a sound technique which movie author Michael Barson describes as \"a breathtaking innovation at the time.\"<ref name=Barson>{{cite book |author=Barson, Michael |title=The Illustrated Who's-Who of Hollywood Directors |publisher=Noonday Press |year=1995 |pages=12\u201315}}</ref> He developed it, Altman said, to force viewers to pay attention and become engaged in the film as if they were an active participant.<ref name=Wakeman/> According to some critics, one of the more extreme uses of the technique is in ''[[McCabe and Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), also considered among his finest films.<ref name=Hillstrom>{{cite book |editor=Hillstrom, Laurie Collier |title=International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers |volume=2 |publisher=St. James Press |year=1997 |pages=12\u201317}}</ref>\n\nHowever, overlapping dialogue among large groups of actors adds complexity to Altman's films, and they were often criticized as appearing haphazard or disconnected on first viewing. Some of his critics, however, changed their mind after seeing them again. British film critic, [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], gave ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) a bad review after watching it the first time, but later wrote, \"But going back to ''Nashville'' and some of the earlier films, ... made me reflect: It remains enigmatic how organized or purposeful ''Nashville'' is. ... The mosaic, or mix, permits a freedom and a human idiosyncrasy that [[Jean Renoir|Renoir]] might have admired.\"<ref name=Thomson>{{cite book |author=Thomson, David |title=The New Biographical Dictionary of Film |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |place=New York, N.Y. |year=2002 |pages=13\u201314}}</ref> During the making of the film, the actors were inspired, and co-star [[Ronee Blakley]] was convinced of the film's ultimate success:\n\n{{quote|Yes, I did think it was going to be great, all the work was so good, every actor was inspired, and Altman's team was intensely competent, and he was that rare kind of genius who knows what works and what doesn't at the moment it is happening.<ref>[http://blogs.indiewire.com/mediamatrix/00000142-1f59-d3e8-a77e-1ffb2ab80000 \"Ronee Blakley Reflects About Robert Altman's epic film 'Nashville'\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117054947/http://blogs.indiewire.com/mediamatrix/00000142-1f59-d3e8-a77e-1ffb2ab80000 |date=November 17, 2013 }}, ''Indiewire'', Nov. 3, 2013</ref>}}\n\nThomson later recognized those aspects as being part of Altman's style, beginning with ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970): \"''MASH'' began to develop the crucial Altman style of overlapping, blurred sound and images so slippery with zoom that there was no sense of composition. That is what makes ''Nashville'' so absorbing.\"<ref name=Thomson/> Altman explained that to him such overlapping dialogue in his films was closer to reality, especially with large groups: \"If you've got fourteen people at a dinner table, it seems to me it's pretty unlikely that only two of them are going to be talking.\"<ref name=Stevens/> [[Pauline Kael]] writes that Altman, \"the master of large ensembles, loose action, and overlapping voices, demonstrates that ... he can make film fireworks out of next to nothing.\"<ref name=Wakeman/>\n\n=== Photography ===\nAltman's distinctive style of directing carried over into his preferences for camerawork. Among them was his use of widescreen compositions, intended to capture the many people or activities taking place on screen at the same time. For some films, such as ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'', he created a powerful visual atmosphere with cinematographer [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], such as scenes using fluid camerawork, zoom lenses, and a smoky effect using special fog filters.<ref name=Frost>{{cite book |author=Frost, Jacqueline B. |title=Cinematography for Directors: A guide for creative collaboration |publisher=Michael Wiese Productions |year=2009 |pages=46, 221}}</ref> Director [[Stanley Kubrick]] told Altman that \"the camerawork was wonderful,\" and asked, \"How did you do it?\"<ref name=Rogers/>\n\nIn ''Nashville'', Altman used sets with noticeable colors of reds, whites and blues. For ''The Long Goodbye'', he insisted that Zsigmond keep the camera mobile by mounting it to moving objects.<ref name=Hillstrom/> Zsigmond states that Altman \"wanted to do something different\" in this film, and told him he \"wanted the camera to move \u2014 all the time. Up. down. In and out. Side to side.\"<ref name=Rogers/> Cinematographer [[Roger Deakins]], discussing his use of zoom lenses, commented, \"I would find it quite exciting to shoot a film with a zoom lens if it was that observational, roving kind of look that Robert Altman was known for. He'd put the camera on a jib arm and float across the scene and pick out these shots as he went along \u2013 quite a nice way of working.\"<ref name=Frost/>\n\nZsigmond also recalls that working with Altman was fun:\n\n{{quote|We rather enjoyed doing things \"improv.\" Altman is a great improviser. During the first few days of the shoot, he would \"create\" different approaches on a moment's notice. He would show me how he wanted the camera to move \u2014 always move. Which was fun. The actors loved it, and I was always challenged to find ways to shoot what Altman came up with.<ref name=Rogers>{{cite book |author=Rogers, Pauline S. |title=More Contemporary Cinematographers on Their Art |publisher=Focal Press |year=2000 |pages=178\u2013179}}</ref>}}\n\nVilmos Zsigmond's cinematography in ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' received a nomination by the [[British Academy Film Awards]].\n\n=== Music scores ===\nWhen using music in his films, Altman was known to be highly selective, often choosing music that he personally liked.

First held in 1887, the Cup celebrated its 120th anniversary in 2007.\n\nSchools Senior Cup Rugby is divided into 4 tiers in two sections and each cup competition bears a name as follows: Section A [[Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Development Cup]] (effectively division 4), Section A [[Leinster Schools Rugby McMullen Cup]] (effectively division 3), Section B [[Leinster Schools Vinnie Murray Cup]] (effectively division 2), Section B Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup (effectively division 1).\n\nAttendances are high for a schoolboy competition, with up to 25,000 present at the final. This match traditionally takes place on [[Saint Patrick's Day]] at [[Aviva Stadium|Lansdowne Road]] (now known as the [[Aviva Stadium]]). In 2008, the final was played at the [[RDS Arena|Royal Dublin Society Grounds]] (RDS) after Donnybrook proved to be way too small for the 2007 final, (Lansdowne Road was closed for redevelopment) and has been the home since. Since the move to the RDS the attendance has decreased and is now typically 10,000- 14,000.\n\nThe competition has been subject to criticism from various quarters as being \"elitist\" (as most of the competing schools are fee-paying; in fact only one non fee-paying school has won the cup, De La Salle Churchtown) and for putting undue pressure on its participants. It is also the subject of satire through the [[Ross O'Carroll Kelly]] newspaper column and novels. The competition and schools rugby in the four provinces has been praised though with \"Irish (rugby) game in debt to schools rugby\".<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/edmund-van-esbeck-irish-game-in-debt-to-schools-rugby-182795.html Irish game in debt to schools rugby]</ref>\n\n[[Blackrock College]] are the most successful school in the Cup's history, having lifted the Cup 69 times, an accumulative total larger than all other teams combined.<ref name=\"multiple\">\n[http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/members/index.asp?locID=422&docID=-1 Statistics compiled by Des Daly, Irish Rugby Statistician]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThree schools have won the Cup at their first attempt; [[Blackrock College]] in the competition's maiden year in 1887, [[Castleknock College]] who won the first of their eight Leinster titles at the first time of asking when they defeated Blackrock in the 1913 final and Clongowes Wood College who first won the cup in 1926. [[St. Fintan's High School]] are the most recent 'new' school to the competition, making their debut in 2016/17 season and are coached by Belvedere College 2008 Senior Cup winning captain Thomas Sexton and vice-captain Peter Synnott.\n\nTo date only six schools have achieved the Senior and Junior Cup \"double\". These are Blackrock, who have achieved this feat 27 times (1910, 1912, 1927, 1933, 1935\u201336, 1942\u201343, 1945, 1948, 1953\u201354, 1956\u201357, 1962, 1964, 1981\u201382, 1986\u201387, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2013\u201314, 2018), St Michaels twice (2012 & 2019), Newbridge College (2020), Belvedere (2005), Terenure (1958) and Castleknock College (1920).\n\nEven more rare is to lose both the Senior and Junior Cup Finals in the same year. This depressing feat has been achieved by seven schools on 12 occasions. Terenure College leads with 4 (1957, 1964, 1969 & 1987), followed by Belvedere College with 3 (1930, 1944 & 1962), next St Michaels College (2010), St Mary's College (1943), [[Newbridge College]] (1939), Cistercian College Roscrea (1910) and [[Blackrock College]] (2017) with 1 each. This happened to [[Blackrock College]] for the first time in 2017.\n\nBlackrock College have only been defeated in successive finals on two occasions. In the 1920s they were runners up three times in a row, defeated by St Andrews in 1921 & 1922 followed by Belvedere in 1923. The second occasion was in 1979 & 1980 when they were defeated in successive finals by Terenure College.\n\nThe 91st Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final in 1977 between Blackrock College and St Mary\u2019s College finished level at 12 points each at the end of normal time. Having played 70 minutes the two sides now faced an additional 15 minutes extra time. Six minutes into extra time Blackrock got a try from fullback Patrick Hinkson. Hugo MacNeill kicked the sideline conversion. Two further MacNeill penalties in the second half of extra time sealed victory for Blackrock. Among the future Irish senior internationals playing that day were Hugo MacNeill and Paul Dean. The 1977 Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final was played on Sunday 20 March 1977 and not the normal St Patrick\u2019s Day. This decision was made to protect the Lansdowne Road pitch following poor weather prior to the Ireland v France Five Nations fixture on the 19 March. \n\nGrainey video footage is available on archives on www.rte.ie. The edition of Sports Club was broadcast 31 March 1977. The commentator is Fred Cogley.\n\nIn September 1967 The then Minister for Education Donogh O\u2019Malley\u2019s introduced free secondary school education. Only very few Rugby Playing secondary schools opted to join the \"Free Education\" scheme. To date only one of these non-fee paying schools has managed to win the Senior Cup. In 1983 and 1985 De La Salle Churchtown beat Castleknock College and Blackrock College to bring the cup to Churchtown. In 2020 the daughter of the De La Salle coach, Jane Farley produced a wonderful Newstalk podcast documentary called \"Class Rugby\" which in a blast of music, memories and politics takes you back to the 1980's with a band of Churchtown teenagers as they take on the established rugby-playing private schools of Leinster.\n\nIn 2020 the final between Newbridge College and Clongowes Wood College had to be cancelled due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, as a result the title has been shared for the first time. 2020 was also the year that for the first time in the 133 year history of the competition that no Dublin School reached the final.\n\nFour captains have gained the distinction of lifting the cup twice, Larry McMahon (Blackrock College, 1929 and 1930), Garret Gill (Blackrock College, <ref>Leinster Schools Senior Rugby Cup Centenary Celebration 1886-1986</ref>1962 and 1963), Jonny Mion ([[Blackrock College]]) in 1989 and 1990, Barry Gibney (Blackrock College) in 1995 and 1996.\n\nThe Cup, and the Schools who play for it, have a history of producing fine rugby players, many of whom go on to play for [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]]. Players such as [[Denis Hickie]], who captained his [[St Mary's College, Dublin|St. Mary's College]] team to win the cup in 1994, and [[Gordon D'Arcy]] have impressive senior cup records. The most international players produced have come from [[Blackrock College]], with players such as [[Hugo_MacNeill_(rugby_union)|Hugo MacNeill]], [[Brendan Mullin]], [[Brian O'Driscoll]], [[Victor Costello]], [[Shane Byrne (rugby player)|Shane Byrne]], [[Bob Casey (rugby player)|Bob Casey]], [[Leo Cullen (rugby player)|Leo Cullen]] and more recently [[Luke Fitzgerald]], [[Ian Madigan]], [[Jordi Murphy]], [[Garry Ringrose]] and [[Joey Carbery]]. Terenure College has also produced many Irish international players including Mick Hipwell (also Lion's 1971), Kevin Flynn, Paul Haycock, Niall Hogan (Irish Captain 1995), Conor O'Shea (former head coach Italian national team), Ciaran Clarke, and Girvan Dempsey. De La Salle Churchtown produced the following Internationals - Des Fitzgerald (34 caps) played in 2 RWCs. Named to Lions Team to mark centenary of IRB\nTom Clancy (9 caps), Brian Glennon (1 cap), Niyi Adeolokun (1 cap), Lar Hudson (7 caps) and Austin Quirke (6 caps for France).\n\n==Roll of honour - Most Recent Win Donates Order if Number of Wins Equal==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"width:25%; background:silver;\"| '''School'''\n!  style=\"width:30%; background:silver;\"| '''Location'''\n!  style=\"width:5%; background:silver;\"| '''Titles'''\n!  style=\"width:40%; background:silver;\"| '''Winning years'''\n\n|-\n|[[File:sq3 skywhitesky.svg|23x23px]] [[Blackrock College]]\n|[[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]], [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]]\n| 69 \n|1887-88, 1890, 1893\u201397, 1900\u201305, 1907-1910, 1912, 1915-1919, 1925, 1927-1930, 1933-1936, 1939, 1940, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1956, 1957, 1960, 1962,1964, 1967, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2018\n'''SCT & JCT''' '''Double''' 27 times - '''1910, 1912, 1927, 1933, proof 1935, 1936, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1948, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1957, 1962, 1964, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2018'''\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 blackwhiteblack.svg|23x23px]] [[Belvedere College]]\n| [[Great Denmark Street]] , [[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n| 12\n|1923\u201324, 1938, 1946, 1951, 1968, 1971\u201372, '''2005 (Double)''', 2008, 2016\u201317\n\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 blackpurplewhite.svg|23x23px]] [[Terenure College]]\n|[[Terenure]], [[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n| 10\n|1952, '''1958 (Double)''', 1979\u201380, 1984, 1992\u201393, 1997, 2001, 2003\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 navyskyyellow.svg|23x23px]] [[Castleknock College]]\n| [[Castleknock]], [[Dublin]]\n| 8\n|1913, '''1920 (Double)''', 1931, 1937, 1944, 1947, 1959, 1965\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 purplewhitepurple.svg|23x23px]] [[Clongowes Wood College]]\n| [[Clane]], [[County Kildare]]\n| 8\n|1926, 1978, 1988, 1991, 1998, 2000, 2010\u201311\n|-\n|[[Image:sq2 bluewhite.svg|23x23px]] [[St Mary's College, Dublin|St. Mary's College]]\n|[[Rathmines]], [[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n| 5\n|1961, 1966, 1969, 1994, 2002\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 bluewhiteblue.svg|23x23px]] [[St. Andrew's College (Ireland)|St. Andrew's College]]\n| [[Booterstown]], [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]]\n| 4\n| 1906, 1911, 1921\u201322\n|-\n|[[Image:sq2 skynavy.svg|23x23px]] [[St Michael's College, Dublin|St. Michael's College]]\n|[[Ailesbury Road]], [[Dublin 4]]\n| 3\n|2007, '''2012(Double)''', '''2019(Double)'''\n|-\n|[[Image:sq2 whiteblack.svg|23x23px]] [[Newbridge College]]\n| [[Newbridge, County Kildare|Newbridge]], [[County Kildare]]\n| 2\n|1941, 1970\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 maroonyellowmaroon.svg|23x23px]] [[De La Salle College Churchtown|De La Salle Churchtown]]\n| [[Churchtown, Dublin|Churchtown]], [[Dublin]]\n| 2\n|1983, 1985\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 redyellowblack.svg|23x23px]] [[C.B.C.

In September 2013, [http://www.beauchamps.ie Beauchamps Solicitors] became the new title sponsor for the Leinster Schools Senior Cup. For the duration of this partnership with Beauchamps, the Senior Cup will be known as the \"Beauchamps Leinster Schools Senior Cup\".<ref>http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/domestic/10954.php#.Us166rR0mPx</ref>\n\nThe competition receives extensive coverage in Ireland's broadsheets, in particular ''[[The Irish Independent]]'' and ''[[The Irish Times]]''. Both publish previews of each year's competition and provide match reports for each game played.\n\nIn years gone by the competition's final on St Patrick's Day would sometimes be broadcast on [[TG4]], however, this was discontinued in the early 2000s. From 2005 onwards, however, [[Setanta Sports]] began extensive coverage of school's rugby. This included the finals of all provincial finals and coverage of the Leinster Schools Junior Cup. The Leinster Senior Cup was most prominent, however, with coverage from every game played at Donnybrook and every round of the competition.\n\n[[FreeSports]] replaced [[Eir Sport]] as the competition broadcaster ahead of the 2019 competition where they will broadcast eight games live.<ref>{{citeweb|url= https://www.the42.ie/leinster-senior-schools-cup-freesports-tv-coverage-4433241-Jan2019/|title =Leinster Rugby announces new TV deal for 2019 Senior Schools Cup|date=11 January 2019|work=The 42|accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Leinster School of the Year Award==\nIn 2008, Leinster Rugby instituted a new award for overall performance of a school at every level of schools rugby.

He takes part in several campaigns with the school, including the Leinster Junior Cup. The school's name is an homage to that in Paul Howard's books, as Siggins had coined the name \"Ross O'Carroll Kelly\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Leinster Schools Vinnie Murray Cup]]\n* [[Leinster Schools Rugby McMullen Cup]]\n* [[Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Development Cup]]\n* [[Leinster Schools Junior Cup]]\n* [[Leinster Rugby]]\n* [[Connacht Schools Senior Cup]]\n* [[Munster Schools Rugby Senior Cup]]\n* [[Ulster Schools Senior Cup]]\n* [[Ireland national schoolboy rugby union team]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090629185401/http://www.cbcrugby.com/ CBC Monkstown Rugby]\n* [http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/members/index.asp?locID=20&docID=1436 This Year's Draw]\n* [http://www.leinsterrugby.ie Leinster Rugby]\n* [http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/members/index.asp?locID=422&docID=-1 Statistics compiled by Des Daly, Irish Rugby Statistician]\n* [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2009/0121/1232474670860.html 2009 Irish Times Preview]\n* [https://www.leinsterrugby.ie/irfu-conclude-incomplete-201920-season-immediate-effect/]\n\n{{Rugby union in Ireland}}\n\n[[Category:High school rugby union competitions in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Rugby union competitions in Leinster]]\n[[Category:1887 establishments in Ireland]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n{{Infobox Sports league|title=Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Cup|sport=Rugby Union|founded=1887|teams=16 (season 2018\u201319)|most_champs=[[Blackrock College]]<br>69|}}\n\n[[File:Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup.jpg|right|275px|The Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup]]\nThe '''Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup''' is the premier [[rugby union]] competition for secondary schools affiliated to the [[Leinster Branch]] of the [[IRFU]]. First held in 1887, the Cup celebrated its 120th anniversary in 2007.\n\nSchools Senior Cup Rugby is divided into 4 tiers in two sections and each cup competition bears a name as follows: Section A [[Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Development Cup]] (effectively division 4), Section A [[Leinster Schools Rugby McMullen Cup]] (effectively division 3), Section B [[Leinster Schools Vinnie Murray Cup]] (effectively division 2), Section B Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup (effectively division 1).\n\nAttendances are high for a schoolboy competition, with up to 25,000 present at the final. This match traditionally takes place on [[Saint Patrick's Day]] at [[Aviva Stadium|Lansdowne Road]] (now known as the [[Aviva Stadium]]). In 2008, the final was played at the [[RDS Arena|Royal Dublin Society Grounds]] (RDS) after Donnybrook proved to be way too small for the 2007 final, (Lansdowne Road was closed for redevelopment) and has been the home since. Since the move to the RDS the attendance has decreased and is now typically 10,000- 14,000.\n\nThe competition has been subject to criticism from various quarters as being \"elitist\" (as most of the competing schools are fee-paying; in fact only one non fee-paying school has won the cup, De La Salle Churchtown) and for putting undue pressure on its participants. It is also the subject of satire through the [[Ross O'Carroll Kelly]] newspaper column and novels. The competition and schools rugby in the four provinces has been praised though with \"Irish (rugby) game in debt to schools rugby\".<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/edmund-van-esbeck-irish-game-in-debt-to-schools-rugby-182795.html Irish game in debt to schools rugby]</ref>\n\n[[Blackrock College]] are the most successful school in the Cup's history, having lifted the Cup 69 times, an accumulative total larger than all other teams combined.<ref name=\"multiple\">\n[http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/members/index.asp?locID=422&docID=-1 Statistics compiled by Des Daly, Irish Rugby Statistician]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThree schools have won the Cup at their first attempt; [[Blackrock College]] in the competition's maiden year in 1887, [[Castleknock College]] who won the first of their eight Leinster titles at the first time of asking when they defeated Blackrock in the 1913 final and Clongowes Wood College who first won the cup in 1926. [[St. Fintan's High School]] are the most recent 'new' school to the competition, making their debut in 2016/17 season and are coached by Belvedere College 2008 Senior Cup winning captain Thomas Sexton and vice-captain Peter Synnott.\n\nTo date only six schools have achieved the Senior and Junior Cup \"double\". These are Blackrock, who have achieved this feat 27 times (1910, 1912, 1927, 1933, 1935\u201336, 1942\u201343, 1945, 1948, 1953\u201354, 1956\u201357, 1962, 1964, 1981\u201382, 1986\u201387, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2013\u201314, 2018), St Michaels twice (2012 & 2019), Newbridge College (2020), Belvedere (2005), Terenure (1958) and Castleknock College (1920).\n\nEven more rare is to lose both the Senior and Junior Cup Finals in the same year. This depressing feat has been achieved by seven schools on 12 occasions. Terenure College leads with 4 (1957, 1964, 1969 & 1987), followed by Belvedere College with 3 (1930, 1944 & 1962), next St Michaels College (2010), St Mary's College (1943), [[Newbridge College]] (1939), Cistercian College Roscrea (1910) and [[Blackrock College]] (2017) with 1 each. This happened to [[Blackrock College]] for the first time in 2017.\n\nBlackrock College have only been defeated in successive finals on two occasions. In the 1920s they were runners up three times in a row, defeated by St Andrews in 1921 & 1922 followed by Belvedere in 1923. The second occasion was in 1979 & 1980 when they were defeated in successive finals by Terenure College.\n\nThe 91st Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final in 1977 between Blackrock College and St Mary\u2019s College finished level at 12 points each at the end of normal time. Having played 70 minutes the two sides now faced an additional 15 minutes extra time. Six minutes into extra time Blackrock got a try from fullback Patrick Hinkson. Hugo MacNeill kicked the sideline conversion. Two further MacNeill penalties in the second half of extra time sealed victory for Blackrock. Among the future Irish senior internationals playing that day were Hugo MacNeill and Paul Dean. The 1977 Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final was played on Sunday 20 March 1977 and not the normal St Patrick\u2019s Day. This decision was made to protect the Lansdowne Road pitch following poor weather prior to the Ireland v France Five Nations fixture on the 19 March. \n\nGrainey video footage is available on archives on www.rte.ie. The edition of Sports Club was broadcast 31 March 1977. The commentator is Fred Cogley.\n\nIn September 1967 The then Minister for Education Donogh O\u2019Malley\u2019s introduced free secondary school education. Only very few Rugby Playing secondary schools opted to join the \"Free Education\" scheme. To date only one of these non-fee paying schools has managed to win the Senior Cup. In 1983 and 1985 De La Salle Churchtown beat Castleknock College and Blackrock College to bring the cup to Churchtown. In 2020 the daughter of the De La Salle coach, Jane Farley produced a wonderful Newstalk podcast documentary called \"Class Rugby\" which in a blast of music, memories and politics takes you back to the 1980's with a band of Churchtown teenagers as they take on the established rugby-playing private schools of Leinster.\n\nIn 2020 the final between Newbridge College and Clongowes Wood College had to be cancelled due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, as a result the title has been shared for the first time. 2020 was also the year that for the first time in the 133 year history of the competition that no Dublin School reached the final.\n\nFour captains have gained the distinction of lifting the cup twice, Larry McMahon (Blackrock College, 1929 and 1930), Garret Gill (Blackrock College, <ref>Leinster Schools Senior Rugby Cup Centenary Celebration 1886-1986</ref>1962 and 1963), Jonny Mion ([[Blackrock College]]) in 1989 and 1990, Barry Gibney (Blackrock College) in 1995 and 1996.\n\nThe Cup, and the Schools who play for it, have a history of producing fine rugby players, many of whom go on to play for [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]]. Players such as [[Denis Hickie]], who captained his [[St Mary's College, Dublin|St. Mary's College]] team to win the cup in 1994, and [[Gordon D'Arcy]] have impressive senior cup records. The most international players produced have come from [[Blackrock College]], with players such as [[Hugo_MacNeill_(rugby_union)|Hugo MacNeill]], [[Brendan Mullin]], [[Brian O'Driscoll]], [[Victor Costello]], [[Shane Byrne (rugby player)|Shane Byrne]], [[Bob Casey (rugby player)|Bob Casey]], [[Leo Cullen (rugby player)|Leo Cullen]] and more recently [[Luke Fitzgerald]], [[Ian Madigan]], [[Jordi Murphy]], [[Garry Ringrose]] and [[Joey Carbery]].

It uses [[Contactless smart cards on the buses and trams of Britain|contactless smart card]] technology, including a microprocessor chip (computer chip) and antenna (for both power to the chip and communication) embedded in the front or back cover, or centre page, of the passport. The passport's critical information is printed on the data page of the passport, repeated on the [[Machine-readable passport|machine readable lines]] and stored in the chip. [[Public key infrastructure]] (PKI) is used to authenticate the data stored electronically in the passport chip, making it expensive and difficult to forge when all security mechanisms are fully and correctly implemented.\n\nMany countries are moving towards the issue of biometric passports. Malaysia was the first country to issue biometric passports in 1998.<ref name=\"icaomy\" /> In December 2008, 60 countries were issuing such passports,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://findbiometrics.com/over-60-countries-now-issuing-epassports-2/|title=Over 60+ countries now issuing ePassports - FindBiometrics|date=30 December 2008|work=FindBiometrics|access-date=5 April 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> which increased to 120 by June 2017.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.gemalto.com/govt/travel/electronic-passport-trends 2/ |title=120 countries now issuing ePassports - Gemalto report|date=21 June 2017|work=Gemalto|access-date=21 June 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe currently standardised biometrics used for this type of identification system are [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition]], [[fingerprint recognition]], and [[iris recognition]]. These were adopted after assessment of several different kinds of biometrics including [[retinal scan]]. Document and chip characteristics are documented in the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]]'s (ICAO) Doc 9303 (ICAO9303).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icao.int/publications/pages/publication.aspx?docnum=9303 |title=ICAO Document 9303, Part 1, Volume 1 (OCR machine-readable passports) |last= |first= |date= |website=ICAO |format=PDF |accessdate=21 February 2017}}</ref> The ICAO defines the biometric file formats and communication protocols to be used in passports. Only the digital image (usually in [[JPEG]] or [[JPEG2000]] format) of each biometric feature is actually stored in the chip. The comparison of biometric features is performed outside the passport chip by electronic border control systems (e-borders). To store biometric data on the contactless chip, it includes a minimum of 32 kilobytes of [[EEPROM]] storage memory, and runs on an interface in accordance with the [[ISO/IEC 14443]] international standard, amongst others. These standards intend interoperability between different countries and different manufacturers of passport books.\n\nSome [[national identity cards]], such as those [[Dutch identity card|from the Netherlands]], [[Albanian Identity Card|Albania]] and [[Brazilian Identity Card|Brazil]], are fully ICAO9303 compliant biometric [[travel documents]]. However others, such as the [[United States Passport Card]], are not.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hegemann|first=Hendrik|date=March 2015|title=Constructions of Effectiveness and the Rationalization of Counterterrorism Policy: The Case of Biometric Passports.|url=|journal=Studies in Conflict & Terrorism|volume=38|issue=3|pages=199\u2013218|doi=10.1080/1057610X.2014.982384}}</ref>\n\n==Data protection==\nBiometric passports have protection mechanisms to avoid and/or detect attacks:\n; Non-traceable chip characteristics: Random chip identifiers reply to each request with a different chip number. This prevents tracing of passport chips. Using random identification numbers is optional.\n; [[Basic Access Control]] (BAC): BAC protects the communication channel between the chip and the reader by encrypting transmitted information. Before data can be read from a chip, the reader needs to provide a key which is derived from the [[Machine-readable passport|Machine Readable Zone]]: the date of birth, the date of expiry and the document number. If BAC is used, an attacker cannot (easily) eavesdrop transferred information without knowing the correct key. Using BAC is optional.\n; Passive Authentication (PA): PA is aimed at identifying modification of passport chip data. The chip contains a file, Document Security Object (SOD), that stores [[cryptographic hash function|hash values]] of all files stored in the chip (picture, fingerprint, etc.) and a [[digital signature]] of these hashes. The digital signature is made using a document signing key which itself is signed by a country signing key. If a file in the chip (e.g., the picture) is changed, this can be detected since the hash value is incorrect. Readers need access to all used public country keys to check whether the digital signature is generated by a trusted country. Using PA is mandatory.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} According to a September 2011 [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] document released by [[WikiLeaks]] in December 2014, \"Although falsified e-passports will not have the correct digital signature, inspectors may not detect the fraud if the passports are from countries that do not participate in the [[International Civil Aviation Organization Public Key Directory|International Civil Aviation Organization's Public Key Directory]] (ICAO PKD).<ref name=\"cia-ss\">{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/cia-travel/secondary-screening/WikiLeaks_CIA_Assessment_on_Surviving_Secondary_Screening.pdf|title=Surviving Secondary: An Identity Threat Assessment of Secondary Screening Procedures at International Airports|author=Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=[[WikiLeaks]]|date=September 2011|author-link=Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref> As of January 2017, 55 of over 60 e-passport-issuing countries belong to the PKD program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/Security/FAL/PKD/Pages/ICAO-PKDParticipants.aspx|title=ICAO PKD Participants|publisher=[[International Civil Aviation Organization]]|date=January 2017}}</ref>\n; Active Authentication (AA): AA prevents cloning of passport chips. The chip contains a private key that cannot be read or copied, but its existence can easily be proven. Using AA is optional.\n; [[Extended Access Control]] (EAC): EAC adds functionality to check the authenticity of both the chip (chip authentication) and the reader (terminal authentication). Furthermore, it uses stronger encryption than BAC. EAC is typically used to protect fingerprints and iris scans. Using EAC is optional. In the [[European Union]], using EAC is mandatory for all documents issued starting 28 June 2009.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n; [[Supplemental access control|Supplemental Access Control]] (SAC): SAC was introduced by ICAO in 2009 for addressing [[Basic Access Control|BAC]] weaknesses. It was introduced as a supplement to BAC (for keeping compatibility), but will replace it in the future.\n; Shielding the chip: This prevents unauthorised reading. Some countries \u2013 including at least the US \u2013 have integrated a very thin metal mesh into the passport's cover to act as a [[Faraday cage|shield]] when the passport cover is closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8227-metal-shields-and-encryption-for-us-passports.html |title=Metal shields and encryption for US passports |work=New Scientist |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> The use of shielding is optional.\n\nTo assure interoperability and functionality of the security mechanisms listed above, ICAO and German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) have specified several test cases.

The affected chips block read access until the future date is reached.\n\n==Opposition==\n[[Privacy]] proponents in many countries question and protest the lack of information about exactly what the passports' chip will contain, and whether they impact [[civil liberties]]. The main problem they point out is that data on the passports can be transferred with wireless [[RFID]] technology, which can become a major vulnerability. Although this could allow [[Identity document|ID]]-check computers to obtain a person's information without a physical connection, it may also allow anyone with the necessary equipment to perform the same task. If the personal information and passport numbers on the chip are not [[Encryption|encrypted]], the information might wind up in the wrong hands.\n\nOn 15 December 2006, the [[BBC]] published an article<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/6182207.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Programmes - Click - ePassports 'at risk' from cloning|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> on the British ePassport, citing the above stories and adding that:\n:\"Nearly every country issuing this passport has a few security experts who are yelling at the top of their lungs and trying to shout out: 'This is not secure.

The driving force of the initiative is the U.S. Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 (also known as the \"Border Security Act\"), which states that such [[smartcard]] [[identity card]]s will be able to replace [[visa (document)|visa]]s. As for foreigners travelling to the U.S., if they wish to enter U.S. visa-free under the [[Visa Waiver Program]] (VWP), they are now required to possess machine-readable passports that comply with international standards. Additionally, for travellers holding a valid passport issued on or after 26 October 2006, such a passport must be a biometric passport if used to enter the U.S. visa-free under the VWP.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn November 2018, [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] and [[Delta Air Lines]] opened the nation's first curb-to-gate biometric terminal, which promised to improve aviation security while moving travelers faster through screening.<ref>[https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/atlanta-airport-first-us-biometric-terminal-facial-recognition/index.html US airport opens first fully biometric terminal] - CNN travel</ref>\n\n===Uruguay===\n{{See also|Uruguayan passport}}\nThe Uruguayan Ministry of the Interior started to issue biometric passports to Uruguayan citizens on 16 October 2015.

It uses [[Contactless smart cards on the buses and trams of Britain|contactless smart card]] technology, including a microprocessor chip (computer chip) and antenna (for both power to the chip and communication) embedded in the front or back cover, or centre page, of the passport. The passport's critical information is printed on the data page of the passport, repeated on the [[Machine-readable passport|machine readable lines]] and stored in the chip. [[Public key infrastructure]] (PKI) is used to authenticate the data stored electronically in the passport chip, making it expensive and difficult to forge when all security mechanisms are fully and correctly implemented.\n\nMany countries are moving towards the issue of biometric passports. Malaysia was the first country to issue biometric passports in 1998.<ref name=\"icaomy\" /> In December 2008, 60 countries were issuing such passports,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://findbiometrics.com/over-60-countries-now-issuing-epassports-2/|title=Over 60+ countries now issuing ePassports - FindBiometrics|date=30 December 2008|work=FindBiometrics|access-date=5 April 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> which increased to 120 by June 2017.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.gemalto.com/govt/travel/electronic-passport-trends 2/ |title=120 countries now issuing ePassports - Gemalto report|date=21 June 2017|work=Gemalto|access-date=21 June 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe currently standardised biometrics used for this type of identification system are [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition]], [[fingerprint recognition]], and [[iris recognition]]. These were adopted after assessment of several different kinds of biometrics including [[retinal scan]]. Document and chip characteristics are documented in the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]]'s (ICAO) Doc 9303 (ICAO9303).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icao.int/publications/pages/publication.aspx?docnum=9303 |title=ICAO Document 9303, Part 1, Volume 1 (OCR machine-readable passports) |last= |first= |date= |website=ICAO |format=PDF |accessdate=21 February 2017}}</ref> The ICAO defines the biometric file formats and communication protocols to be used in passports. Only the digital image (usually in [[JPEG]] or [[JPEG2000]] format) of each biometric feature is actually stored in the chip. The comparison of biometric features is performed outside the passport chip by electronic border control systems (e-borders). To store biometric data on the contactless chip, it includes a minimum of 32 kilobytes of [[EEPROM]] storage memory, and runs on an interface in accordance with the [[ISO/IEC 14443]] international standard, amongst others. These standards intend interoperability between different countries and different manufacturers of passport books.\n\nSome [[national identity cards]], such as those [[Dutch identity card|from the Netherlands]], [[Albanian Identity Card|Albania]] and [[Brazilian Identity Card|Brazil]], are fully ICAO9303 compliant biometric [[travel documents]].

This prevents tracing of passport chips. Using random identification numbers is optional.\n; [[Basic Access Control]] (BAC): BAC protects the communication channel between the chip and the reader by encrypting transmitted information. Before data can be read from a chip, the reader needs to provide a key which is derived from the [[Machine-readable passport|Machine Readable Zone]]: the date of birth, the date of expiry and the document number. If BAC is used, an attacker cannot (easily) eavesdrop transferred information without knowing the correct key. Using BAC is optional.\n; Passive Authentication (PA): PA is aimed at identifying modification of passport chip data. The chip contains a file, Document Security Object (SOD), that stores [[cryptographic hash function|hash values]] of all files stored in the chip (picture, fingerprint, etc.) and a [[digital signature]] of these hashes. The digital signature is made using a document signing key which itself is signed by a country signing key. If a file in the chip (e.g., the picture) is changed, this can be detected since the hash value is incorrect. Readers need access to all used public country keys to check whether the digital signature is generated by a trusted country. Using PA is mandatory.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} According to a September 2011 [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] document released by [[WikiLeaks]] in December 2014, \"Although falsified e-passports will not have the correct digital signature, inspectors may not detect the fraud if the passports are from countries that do not participate in the [[International Civil Aviation Organization Public Key Directory|International Civil Aviation Organization's Public Key Directory]] (ICAO PKD).<ref name=\"cia-ss\">{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/cia-travel/secondary-screening/WikiLeaks_CIA_Assessment_on_Surviving_Secondary_Screening.pdf|title=Surviving Secondary: An Identity Threat Assessment of Secondary Screening Procedures at International Airports|author=Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=[[WikiLeaks]]|date=September 2011|author-link=Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref> As of January 2017, 55 of over 60 e-passport-issuing countries belong to the PKD program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/Security/FAL/PKD/Pages/ICAO-PKDParticipants.aspx|title=ICAO PKD Participants|publisher=[[International Civil Aviation Organization]]|date=January 2017}}</ref>\n; Active Authentication (AA): AA prevents cloning of passport chips. The chip contains a private key that cannot be read or copied, but its existence can easily be proven. Using AA is optional.\n; [[Extended Access Control]] (EAC): EAC adds functionality to check the authenticity of both the chip (chip authentication) and the reader (terminal authentication). Furthermore, it uses stronger encryption than BAC. EAC is typically used to protect fingerprints and iris scans. Using EAC is optional. In the [[European Union]], using EAC is mandatory for all documents issued starting 28 June 2009.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n; [[Supplemental access control|Supplemental Access Control]] (SAC): SAC was introduced by ICAO in 2009 for addressing [[Basic Access Control|BAC]] weaknesses. It was introduced as a supplement to BAC (for keeping compatibility), but will replace it in the future.\n; Shielding the chip: This prevents unauthorised reading. Some countries \u2013 including at least the US \u2013 have integrated a very thin metal mesh into the passport's cover to act as a [[Faraday cage|shield]] when the passport cover is closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8227-metal-shields-and-encryption-for-us-passports.html |title=Metal shields and encryption for US passports |work=New Scientist |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> The use of shielding is optional.\n\nTo assure interoperability and functionality of the security mechanisms listed above, ICAO and German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) have specified several test cases. These test specifications are updated with every new protocol and are covering details starting from the paper used and ending in the chip that is included.<ref>{{cite web|first=Holger |last=Funke |title=Overview of eMRTD test specifications|url=https://blog.protocolbench.org/test-specifications/|work=blog.protocolbench.org}}</ref>\n\n==Attacks==\nSince the introduction of biometric passports, several attacks have been presented and demonstrated.\n\n; Non-traceable chip characteristics\n: In 2008 a Radboud/Lausitz University team demonstrated that it's possible to determine which country a passport chip is from without knowing the key required for reading it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ru.nl/~erikpoll/papers/nluug.pdf |title=Fingerprinting Passports |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> The team fingerprinted error messages of passport chips from different countries.

The affected chips block read access until the future date is reached.\n\n==Opposition==\n[[Privacy]] proponents in many countries question and protest the lack of information about exactly what the passports' chip will contain, and whether they impact [[civil liberties]]. The main problem they point out is that data on the passports can be transferred with wireless [[RFID]] technology, which can become a major vulnerability. Although this could allow [[Identity document|ID]]-check computers to obtain a person's information without a physical connection, it may also allow anyone with the necessary equipment to perform the same task. If the personal information and passport numbers on the chip are not [[Encryption|encrypted]], the information might wind up in the wrong hands.\n\nOn 15 December 2006, the [[BBC]] published an article<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/6182207.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Programmes - Click - ePassports 'at risk' from cloning|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> on the British ePassport, citing the above stories and adding that:\n:\"Nearly every country issuing this passport has a few security experts who are yelling at the top of their lungs and trying to shout out: 'This is not secure.

The passport contains a security chip with personal data and digital images. Initially, the new passports will have a 64KB chip with a photograph of passport holder and subsequently include the holder's fingerprint(s). The biometric passport has been tested with passport readers abroad and is noted to have a 4-second response time \u2013 less than that of a [[US Passport]] (10 seconds). The passport need not be carried in a metal jacket for security reasons as it first needs to be passed through a reader, after which it generates access keys to unlock the chip data for reader access.<ref>{{cite web |author=After US tests, India to get first e-passport |url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080050016&ch=16 |title=After US tests, India to get first e-passport |publisher=NDTV.com |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=8 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702195455/http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080050016 |archivedate=2 July 2008 }}</ref> On 25 June 2008 Indian Passport Authority issued the first e-passport to [[Pratibha Patil]] the [[President of India]] at the time.

High security required cracking down on counterfeit passports. In October 2004, the production stages of this high-tech passport commenced as the [[U.S. Government Printing Office]] (GPO) issued awards to the top bidders of the program. The awards totaled to roughly $1,000,000 for startup, development, and testing. The driving force of the initiative is the U.S. Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 (also known as the \"Border Security Act\"), which states that such [[smartcard]] [[identity card]]s will be able to replace [[visa (document)|visa]]s. As for foreigners travelling to the U.S., if they wish to enter U.S. visa-free under the [[Visa Waiver Program]] (VWP), they are now required to possess machine-readable passports that comply with international standards. Additionally, for travellers holding a valid passport issued on or after 26 October 2006, such a passport must be a biometric passport if used to enter the U.S. visa-free under the VWP.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn November 2018, [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] and [[Delta Air Lines]] opened the nation's first curb-to-gate biometric terminal, which promised to improve aviation security while moving travelers faster through screening.<ref>[https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/atlanta-airport-first-us-biometric-terminal-facial-recognition/index.html US airport opens first fully biometric terminal] - CNN travel</ref>\n\n===Uruguay===\n{{See also|Uruguayan passport}}\nThe Uruguayan Ministry of the Interior started to issue biometric passports to Uruguayan citizens on 16 October 2015.

Although the expansion of the Internet blurs the boundaries, distance education technologies are divided into two modes of delivery: [[synchronous learning]] and [[asynchronous learning]].\n\nIn synchronous learning, all participants are \"present\" at the same time. In this regard, it resembles traditional classroom teaching methods despite the participants being located remotely. It requires a timetable to be organized. [[Web conferencing]], [[videoconferencing]], [[educational television]], [[instructional television]] are examples of synchronous technology, as are [[direct-broadcast satellite]] (DBS), [[internet radio]], [[live streaming]], [[telephone]], and [[web-based VoIP]].<ref name=\"lever-duffy\">{{cite book |last1=Lever-Duffy |first1=Judy |last2= McDonald |first2= Jean B |others= Ana A.

Immersive environments (notably SecondLife) have also been used to enhance participant presence in distance education courses. Another form of synchronous learning that has been entering the classroom over the last couple of years is the use of robot proxies<ref>Brown, Robbie. (2013).

Students are not required to be together at the same time. Mail correspondence, which is the oldest form of distance education, is an asynchronous delivery technology, as are [[message board]] forums, [[e-mail]], [[video]] and [[audio recording]]s, print materials, [[voicemail]], and [[fax]].<ref name=\"lever-duffy\" />\n\nThe two methods can be combined. Many courses offered by both open universities and an increasing number of campus based institutions use periodic sessions of residential or day teaching to supplement the sessions delivered at a distance.<ref name=\"Burns\">{{cite book |last1=Burns |first1=Mary | title= Distance Education for Teacher Training: Modes, Models and Methods | url= http://go.edc.org/07xd | accessdate = 10 September 2012}}</ref> This type of mixed distance and campus based education has recently come to be called \"[[blended learning]]\" or less often \"hybrid learning\".

There are many available that cover a broad range of topics.\n\n== Paced and self-paced models ==\nDistance education can be delivered in a paced format similar to traditional campus-based models in which learners commence and complete a course at the same time. Paced delivery is currently the most common mode of distance education delivery. Alternatively, some institutions offer self-paced programs that allow for continuous enrollment and the length of time to complete the course is set by the learner's time, skill and commitment levels. Paced courses may be offered in either synchronous mode, but self-paced courses are almost always offered asynchronously. Each delivery model offers both advantages and disadvantages for students, teachers, and institutions.\n\n[[Andreas Kaplan|Kaplan]] and Haenlein classify distance education into four groups along the dimensions Time dependency and Number of participants: 1) [[MOOCs]] (Massive Open Online Courses): Open-access online course (i.e., without specific participation restrictions) that allows for unlimited (massive) participation; 2) [[Small private online course|SPOCs]] (Small Private Online Courses): Online course that only offers a limited number of places and therefore requires some form of formal enrollment; 3) SMOCs (Synchronous Massive Online Courses): Open-access online course that allows for unlimited participation but requires students to be \"present\" at the same time (synchronously); 4) SSOCs (Synchronous Private Online Courses): Online course that only offers a limited number of places and requires students to be \"present\" at the same time (synchronously).<ref name=\"Kaplan Haenlein 2016\"/>\n\nPaced models are a familiar mode since they are used almost exclusively in campus-based schools. Institutes that offer both distance and campus programs usually use paced models so that teacher workload, student semester planning, tuition deadlines, exam schedules, and other administrative details can be synchronized with campus delivery. Student familiarity and the pressure of deadlines encourages students to readily adapt to and usually succeed in paced models. However, student freedom is sacrificed as a common pace is often too fast for some students and too slow for others. In addition life events, professional or family responsibilities can interfere with a students capability to complete tasks to an external schedule. Finally, paced models allows students to readily form communities of inquiry<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://coi.athabascau.ca|title = Community of Inquiry site|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Athabasca University|last = |first = }}</ref> and to engage in collaborative work.\n\nSelf-paced courses maximize student freedom, as not only can students commence studies on any date, but they can complete a course in as little time as a few weeks or up to a year or longer. Students often enroll in self-paced study when they are under pressure to complete programs, have not been able to complete a scheduled course, need additional courses or have pressure which precludes regular study for any length of time. The self-paced nature of the programming, though, is an unfamiliar model for many students and can lead to excessive procrastination, resulting in course incompletion. Assessment of learning can also be challenging as exams can be written on any day, making it possible for students to share examination questions with resulting loss of academic integrity. Finally, it is extremely challenging to organize collaborative work activities, though some schools<ref>{{Cite book|title = Teaching Crowds: Learning and Social Media|last = Dron|first = Jon|publisher = AU Press|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Anderson|first2 = Terry}}</ref> are developing cooperative models based upon networked and connectivist pedagogies<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.19173/irrodl.v12i3.890 |title=Three generations of distance education pedagogy\t|journal=The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=80\u201397 |year=2011 |last1=Anderson |first1=Terry |last2=Dron |first2=Jon |doi-access=free }}</ref> for use in self-paced programs.\n\n== Benefits ==\n[[Distance line|Distance]]<ref>0</ref> learning can expand access to education and training for both general populace and businesses since its flexible scheduling structure lessens the effects of the many time-constraints imposed by personal responsibilities and commitments.<ref name=Oblinger>{{cite journal |last=Oblinger |first=Diana G. |year=2000 |title=The Nature and Purpose of Distance Education |journal=The Technology Source |volume= |series= |issue=March/April |page= |pages= |publisher=Michigan Virtual University |location=Michigan |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url=http://technologysource.org/article/nature_and_purpose_of_distance_education/ |language= |format= |accessdate=23 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718000146/http://technologysource.org/article/nature_and_purpose_of_distance_education/ |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"CFP\">{{cite journal|last1=Masson|first1=M|title=Benefits of TED Talks|journal=Canadian Family Physician|date=December 2014|volume=60|issue=12|pages=1080|pmid=25500595|pmc=4264800|doi=}}</ref> Devolving some activities off-site alleviates institutional capacity constraints arising from the traditional demand on institutional buildings and infrastructure.<ref name=Oblinger /> Furthermore, there is the potential for increased access to more experts in the field and to other students from diverse geographical, social, cultural, economic, and experiential backgrounds.<ref name=\"Maggio, L.

S. 20022\" />\n\nThere is a theoretical problem about the application of traditional teaching methods to online courses because online courses may have no upper size limit. [[Daniel Barwick]] noted that there is no evidence that large class size is always worse or that small class size is always better, although a negative link has been established between certain types of instruction in large classes and learning outcomes; he argued that higher education has not made a sufficient effort to experiment with a variety of instructional methods to determine whether large class size is always negatively correlated with a reduction in learning outcomes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barwick |first=Daniel W.|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/12/06/barwick |title=Views: Does Class Size Matter? |website=Inside Higher Ed |accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref> Early proponents of Massive Open Online Courses ([[MOOC]])s saw them as just the type of experiment that Barwick had pointed out was lacking in higher education, although Barwick himself has never advocated for [[Massive open online course|MOOCs]].\n\nThere may also be institutional challenges. Distance learning is new enough that it may be a challenge to gain support for these programs in a traditional brick-and-mortar academic learning environment.<ref name=\"Stanton, S. 20012\" /> Furthermore, it may be more difficult for the instructor to organize and plan a distance learning program,<ref name=\"Stebnicki, M. A. 20012\" /> especially since many are new programs and their organizational needs are different from a traditional learning program.\n\nAdditionally, though distance education offers industrial countries the opportunity to become globally informed, there are still negative sides to it. Hellman states that \"These include its cost and capital intensiveness, time constraints and other pressures on instructors, the isolation of students from instructors and their peers, instructors\u2019 enormous difficulty in adequately evaluating students they never meet face-to-face, and drop-out rates far higher than in classroom-based courses.\"<ref name=\"Hellman, Judith Adler 2003\">Hellman, Judith Adler. \"The Riddle of Distance Education.\" Geneva. 1 June 2003.</ref>\n\nA more complex challenge of distance education relates to cultural differences between student and teachers and among students. Distance programmes tend to be more diverse as they could go beyond the geographical borders of regions, countries, and continents, and cross the cultural borders that may exist with respect to race, gender, and religion. That requires a proper understanding and awareness of the norms, differences, preconceptions and potential conflicting issues.<ref name=\"Nasiri et Mafakheri\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03075079.2014.914906 |title=Postgraduate research supervision at a distance: A review of challenges and strategies |journal=Studies in Higher Education |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1962\u20139 |year=2014 |last1=Nasiri |first1=Fuzhan |last2=Mafakheri |first2=Fereshteh }}</ref>\n\n== Educational technology ==\nThe modern use of electronic [[educational technology]] (also called e-learning) facilitates distance learning and independent learning by the extensive use of [[information and communications technology]] (ICT),<ref name=\"CFP\"/> replacing traditional content delivery by postal correspondence.

This gap has been observed to become wider if there is no communication between the learner and teacher and has direct implications over the learning process and future endeavors in distance education. Distance education providers began to introduce various strategies, techniques, and procedures to increase the amount of interaction between learner and teacher. These measures e.g. more frequent face-to-face tutorials, increased use of information and communication technologies including teleconferencing and the Internet, were designed to close the gap in transactional distance.<ref>Soekartawi, Haryono, A. & Librero, F. 2002.

Research shows that [[socialization]] plays an important role in some forms of distance education.<ref name=\"SRE4(13)2\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.09.199 |title=Alleviating the Senses of Isolation and Alienation in the Virtual World: Socialization in Distance Education |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |volume=93 |pages=332\u20137 |year=2013 |last1=Sazmandasfaranjan |first1=Yasha |last2=Shirzad |first2=Farzad |last3=Baradari |first3=Fatemeh |last4=Salimi |first4=Meysam |last5=Salehi |first5=Mehrdad |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nE-courses are also a viable option for distance learning.  There are many available that cover a broad range of topics.\n\n== Paced and self-paced models ==\nDistance education can be delivered in a paced format similar to traditional campus-based models in which learners commence and complete a course at the same time. Paced delivery is currently the most common mode of distance education delivery. Alternatively, some institutions offer self-paced programs that allow for continuous enrollment and the length of time to complete the course is set by the learner's time, skill and commitment levels. Paced courses may be offered in either synchronous mode, but self-paced courses are almost always offered asynchronously. Each delivery model offers both advantages and disadvantages for students, teachers, and institutions.\n\n[[Andreas Kaplan|Kaplan]] and Haenlein classify distance education into four groups along the dimensions Time dependency and Number of participants: 1) [[MOOCs]] (Massive Open Online Courses): Open-access online course (i.e., without specific participation restrictions) that allows for unlimited (massive) participation; 2) [[Small private online course|SPOCs]] (Small Private Online Courses): Online course that only offers a limited number of places and therefore requires some form of formal enrollment; 3) SMOCs (Synchronous Massive Online Courses): Open-access online course that allows for unlimited participation but requires students to be \"present\" at the same time (synchronously); 4) SSOCs (Synchronous Private Online Courses): Online course that only offers a limited number of places and requires students to be \"present\" at the same time (synchronously).<ref name=\"Kaplan Haenlein 2016\"/>\n\nPaced models are a familiar mode since they are used almost exclusively in campus-based schools. Institutes that offer both distance and campus programs usually use paced models so that teacher workload, student semester planning, tuition deadlines, exam schedules, and other administrative details can be synchronized with campus delivery. Student familiarity and the pressure of deadlines encourages students to readily adapt to and usually succeed in paced models. However, student freedom is sacrificed as a common pace is often too fast for some students and too slow for others. In addition life events, professional or family responsibilities can interfere with a students capability to complete tasks to an external schedule. Finally, paced models allows students to readily form communities of inquiry<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://coi.athabascau.ca|title = Community of Inquiry site|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Athabasca University|last = |first = }}</ref> and to engage in collaborative work.\n\nSelf-paced courses maximize student freedom, as not only can students commence studies on any date, but they can complete a course in as little time as a few weeks or up to a year or longer. Students often enroll in self-paced study when they are under pressure to complete programs, have not been able to complete a scheduled course, need additional courses or have pressure which precludes regular study for any length of time. The self-paced nature of the programming, though, is an unfamiliar model for many students and can lead to excessive procrastination, resulting in course incompletion. Assessment of learning can also be challenging as exams can be written on any day, making it possible for students to share examination questions with resulting loss of academic integrity. Finally, it is extremely challenging to organize collaborative work activities, though some schools<ref>{{Cite book|title = Teaching Crowds: Learning and Social Media|last = Dron|first = Jon|publisher = AU Press|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Anderson|first2 = Terry}}</ref> are developing cooperative models based upon networked and connectivist pedagogies<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.19173/irrodl.v12i3.890 |title=Three generations of distance education pedagogy\t|journal=The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=80\u201397 |year=2011 |last1=Anderson |first1=Terry |last2=Dron |first2=Jon |doi-access=free }}</ref> for use in self-paced programs.\n\n== Benefits ==\n[[Distance line|Distance]]<ref>0</ref> learning can expand access to education and training for both general populace and businesses since its flexible scheduling structure lessens the effects of the many time-constraints imposed by personal responsibilities and commitments.<ref name=Oblinger>{{cite journal |last=Oblinger |first=Diana G. |year=2000 |title=The Nature and Purpose of Distance Education |journal=The Technology Source |volume= |series= |issue=March/April |page= |pages= |publisher=Michigan Virtual University |location=Michigan |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url=http://technologysource.org/article/nature_and_purpose_of_distance_education/ |language= |format= |accessdate=23 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718000146/http://technologysource.org/article/nature_and_purpose_of_distance_education/ |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"CFP\">{{cite journal|last1=Masson|first1=M|title=Benefits of TED Talks|journal=Canadian Family Physician|date=December 2014|volume=60|issue=12|pages=1080|pmid=25500595|pmc=4264800|doi=}}</ref> Devolving some activities off-site alleviates institutional capacity constraints arising from the traditional demand on institutional buildings and infrastructure.<ref name=Oblinger /> Furthermore, there is the potential for increased access to more experts in the field and to other students from diverse geographical, social, cultural, economic, and experiential backgrounds.<ref name=\"Maggio, L.

The distance educational increase in communication, particularly communication amongst students and their classmates, is an improvement that has been made to provide distance education students with as many of the opportunities as possible as they would receive in in-person education. The improvement being made in distance education is growing in tandem with the constant technological advancements. Present-day online communication allows students to associate with accredited schools and programs throughout the world that are out of reach for in-person learning. By having the opportunity to be involved in global institutions via distance education, a diverse array of thought is presented to students through communication with their classmates.

Many textbooks are now available as electronic textbooks, known as e-textbooks, which can offer digital textbooks for a reduced price in comparison to traditional textbooks.

[[Daniel Barwick]] noted that there is no evidence that large class size is always worse or that small class size is always better, although a negative link has been established between certain types of instruction in large classes and learning outcomes; he argued that higher education has not made a sufficient effort to experiment with a variety of instructional methods to determine whether large class size is always negatively correlated with a reduction in learning outcomes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barwick |first=Daniel W.|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/12/06/barwick |title=Views: Does Class Size Matter? |website=Inside Higher Ed |accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref> Early proponents of Massive Open Online Courses ([[MOOC]])s saw them as just the type of experiment that Barwick had pointed out was lacking in higher education, although Barwick himself has never advocated for [[Massive open online course|MOOCs]].\n\nThere may also be institutional challenges. Distance learning is new enough that it may be a challenge to gain support for these programs in a traditional brick-and-mortar academic learning environment.<ref name=\"Stanton, S. 20012\" /> Furthermore, it may be more difficult for the instructor to organize and plan a distance learning program,<ref name=\"Stebnicki, M. A. 20012\" /> especially since many are new programs and their organizational needs are different from a traditional learning program.\n\nAdditionally, though distance education offers industrial countries the opportunity to become globally informed, there are still negative sides to it. Hellman states that \"These include its cost and capital intensiveness, time constraints and other pressures on instructors, the isolation of students from instructors and their peers, instructors\u2019 enormous difficulty in adequately evaluating students they never meet face-to-face, and drop-out rates far higher than in classroom-based courses.\"<ref name=\"Hellman, Judith Adler 2003\">Hellman, Judith Adler. \"The Riddle of Distance Education.\" Geneva. 1 June 2003.</ref>\n\nA more complex challenge of distance education relates to cultural differences between student and teachers and among students. Distance programmes tend to be more diverse as they could go beyond the geographical borders of regions, countries, and continents, and cross the cultural borders that may exist with respect to race, gender, and religion. That requires a proper understanding and awareness of the norms, differences, preconceptions and potential conflicting issues.<ref name=\"Nasiri et Mafakheri\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03075079.2014.914906 |title=Postgraduate research supervision at a distance: A review of challenges and strategies |journal=Studies in Higher Education |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1962\u20139 |year=2014 |last1=Nasiri |first1=Fuzhan |last2=Mafakheri |first2=Fereshteh }}</ref>\n\n== Educational technology ==\nThe modern use of electronic [[educational technology]] (also called e-learning) facilitates distance learning and independent learning by the extensive use of [[information and communications technology]] (ICT),<ref name=\"CFP\"/> replacing traditional content delivery by postal correspondence.

Distance education providers began to introduce various strategies, techniques, and procedures to increase the amount of interaction between learner and teacher. These measures e.g. more frequent face-to-face tutorials, increased use of information and communication technologies including teleconferencing and the Internet, were designed to close the gap in transactional distance.<ref>Soekartawi, Haryono, A. & Librero, F. 2002.

The Scottish [[Great Highland bagpipe]]s are the best known examples in the [[Anglophone world]]; however, people have played bagpipes for millennia, and they occur throughout large parts of [[Europe]], [[northern Africa]], and [[western Asia]], including [[Anatolia]], the [[Caucasus]], and around the [[Persian Gulf]]. The term ''bagpipe'' is equally correct in the singular or plural, though pipers usually refer to the bagpipes as \"the pipes\", \"a set of pipes\" or \"a stand of pipes\".\n\n== Construction ==\n{|align=right\n|{{Listen|filename=Skye Boat Song.ogg|title=Skye Boat Song|description=An adaptation of the \"[[Skye Boat Song]]\" for Great Highland bagpipes played by the Clan Stewart Pipe Band.}}\n|}\n[[File:Cantiga bagpipes 1.jpg|thumb|right|A detail from the [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]  showing bagpipes with one chanter and a parallel drone (Spain, 13th century).]]\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 068.jpg|thumb|right|A detail from a painting by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] showing two bagpipers (15th century).]]\nA set of bagpipes minimally consists of an air supply, a bag, a [[chanter]], and usually at least one [[Drone (music)|drone]]. Many bagpipes have more than one drone (and, sometimes, more than one chanter) in various combinations, held in place in stocks\u2014sockets that fasten the various pipes to the bag.\n\n=== Your maw ===\nThe most common method of supplying air to the bag is through blowing into a blowpipe or blowstick. In some pipes the player must cover the tip of the blowpipe with their tongue while inhaling, but most blowpipes have a [[non-return valve]] that eliminates this need. In recent times, there are many instruments that assist in creating a clean air flow to the pipes and assist the collection of condensation.\n\nAn innovation, dating from the 16th or 17th century, is the use of a [[bellows]] to supply air. In these pipes, sometimes called \"[[cauld wind pipes (disambiguation)|cauld wind pipes]]\", air is not heated or moistened by the player's breathing, so bellows-driven bagpipes can use more refined or delicate reeds. Such pipes include the Irish [[uilleann pipes]]; the [[border pipes|border or Lowland pipes]], [[Scottish smallpipes]], [[Northumbrian smallpipes]], [[pastoral pipes]] in Britain; and the [[musette de cour]], the [[musette bechonnet]] and the [[cabrette]] in France, the [[Dudy wielkopolskie]], [[koziol bialy]] and [[koziol czarny]] in Poland.\n\n=== Bag ===\nThe bag is an airtight [[reservoir]] that holds air and regulates its flow via arm pressure, allowing the player to maintain continuous even sound. The player keeps the bag inflated by blowing air into it through a blowpipe or pumping air into it with a bellows. Materials used for bags vary widely, but the most common are the skins of local animals such as goats, dogs, sheep, and cows. More recently, bags made of synthetic materials including [[Gore-Tex]] have become much more common. A drawback of the synthetic bag is the potential for fungal spores to colonise the bag because of a reduction in necessary cleaning, with the associated danger of [[Respiratory tract infection|lung infection]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/scotland/bagpipe-warning-over-threat-of-fatal-fungus-1-2828835 |title=Bagpipe warning over threat of fatal fungus \u2013 Health |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=2013-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref> An advantage of a synthetic bag is that it has a zip which allows the user to fit a more effective moisture trap to the inside of the bag.\n\nBags cut from larger materials are usually [[saddle stitch|saddle-stitched]] with an extra strip folded over the seam and stitched (for skin bags) or glued (for synthetic bags) to reduce leaks. Holes are then cut to accommodate the stocks. In the case of bags made from largely intact animal skins, the stocks are typically tied into the points where the limbs and the head joined the body of the whole animal, a construction technique common in Central Europe.\n\n=== Chanter ===\n{{Main|Chanter}}\nThe chanter is the [[melody]] pipe, played with two hands. Almost all bagpipes have at least one chanter; some pipes have two chanters, particularly those in North Africa, in the Balkans, and in Southwest Asia. A chanter can be bored internally so that the inside walls are parallel (or \"cylindrical\") for its full length, or it can be bored in a conical shape.\n\nThe chanter is usually open-ended, so there is no easy way for the player to stop the pipe from sounding. Thus most bagpipes share a constant, [[legato]] sound where there are no rests in the music. Primarily because of this inability to stop playing, technical movements are used to break up notes and to create the illusion of articulation and accents. Because of their importance, these embellishments (or \"ornaments\") are often highly technical systems specific to each bagpipe, and take many years of study to master. A few bagpipes (such as the musette de cour, the [[uilleann pipes]], the Northumbrian smallpipes, the [[Piva (bagpipe)|piva]] and the left chanter of the [[surdelina]]) have closed ends or stop the end on the player's leg, so that when the player \"closes\" (covers all the holes) the chanter becomes silent.\n\nA [[practice chanter]] is a chanter without bag or drones, allowing a player to practice the instrument quietly and with no variables other than playing the chanter.\n\nThe term ''chanter'' is derived from the Latin ''cantare'', or \"to sing\", much like the modern French word ''[[wikt:chanteur#French|chanteur]]''.\n\n==== Chanter reed ====\nThe note from the chanter is produced by a [[Reed (instrument)|reed]] installed at its top. The reed may be a [[Single-reed instrument|single]] (a reed with one vibrating tongue) or [[double reed]] (of two pieces that vibrate against each other). Double reeds are used with both conical- and parallel-bored chanters while single reeds are generally (although not exclusively) limited to parallel-bored chanters. In general, double-reed chanters are found in pipes of Western Europe while single-reed chanters appear in most other regions.\n\n=== Drone ===\nMost bagpipes have at least one [[drone (music)|drone]]: a pipe which is generally not fingered but rather produces a constant harmonizing note throughout play (usually the tonic note of the chanter). Exceptions are generally those pipes which have a double-chanter instead. A drone is most commonly a cylindrically-bored tube with a single reed, although drones with double reeds exist. The drone is generally designed in two or more parts with a sliding joint so that the pitch of the drone can be adjusted.\n\nDepending on the type of pipes, the drones may lie over the shoulder, across the arm opposite the bag, or may run parallel to the chanter. Some drones have a tuning screw, which effectively alters the length of the drone by opening a hole, allowing the drone to be tuned to two or more distinct pitches. The tuning screw may also shut off the drone altogether. In most types of pipes, where there is one drone it is pitched two octaves below the tonic of the chanter. Additional drones often add the octave below and then a drone consonant with the fifth of the chanter.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Ancient origins ===\nThe evidence for pre-Roman era bagpipes is still uncertain but several textual and visual clues have been suggested.

This triggered a long, slow decline that continued, in most cases, into the 20th century.\n\nExtensive and documented collections of traditional bagpipes can be found in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[International Bagpipe Museum]] in [[Gij\u00f3n]], Spain, the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]] in Oxford, England and the [[Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum]] in Northumberland, and the [[Musical Instrument Museum (Phoenix)|Musical Instrument Museum]] in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n[[File:MDF Strakonice 2018 09 Anglie 02.jpg|thumb|left|International Bagpipe Festival, Strakonice, 2018]]\n\nThe [[International Bagpipe Festival]] (''Mezin\u00e1rodn\u00ed dud\u00e1ck\u00fd festival'', '''IBF''', '''MDF''') is held every two years in [[Strakonice]], [[Czech Republic]].\n\n=== Recent history ===\n[[File:Afghanistan bagpiper.jpg|thumb|right|A Canadian soldier plays the bagpipes during the War in Afghanistan. Bagpipes are frequently used during funerals and memorials, especially among fire department, military and police forces in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Commonwealth realms, and the US.]]\nDuring the expansion of the British Empire, spearheaded by British military forces that included [[Scottish regiment#Highland Regiments|Highland regiments]], the Scottish Great Highland bagpipe became well known worldwide. This surge in popularity was boosted by large numbers of pipers trained for military service in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The surge coincided with a decline in the popularity of many traditional forms of bagpipe throughout Europe, which began to be displaced by instruments from the classical tradition and later by gramophone and radio.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and [[Commonwealth Nations]] such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia the [[Great Highland bagpipe]] is commonly used in the military and is often played in formal ceremonies. Foreign militaries patterned after the British Army have also taken the Highland bagpipe into use including Uganda, Sudan, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Jordan, and Oman. Many police and fire services in Scotland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and the United States have also adopted the tradition of fielding pipe bands.\n\n[[File:Bagad Brest.jpg|thumb|left|A [[bagad]] in [[Brest, France]]]]\nIn recent years, often driven by revivals of native folk music and dance, many types of bagpipes have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity and, in many cases, instruments that were on the brink of obscurity have become extremely popular. In [[Brittany]], the Great Highland bagpipe and concept of the [[pipe band]] were appropriated to create a Breton interpretation, the [[bagad]]. The pipe band idiom has also been adopted and applied to the [[Galician bagpipe|Galician gaita]] as well. Additionally, bagpipes have often been used in various films depicting moments from Scottish and Irish history; the film ''[[Braveheart]]'' and the theatrical show ''[[Riverdance]]'' have served to make the uilleann pipes more commonly known.\n\nBagpipes are sometimes played at formal events in Commonwealth universities, particularly in Canada. Because of the Scottish influences on the sport of [[curling]], bagpipes are also the official instrument of the [[World Curling Federation]] and are commonly played during a ceremonial procession of teams before major curling championships.\n\nBagpipe making was once a craft that produced instruments in many distinctive local traditional styles. Today, the world's biggest producer of the instrument is Pakistan, where the industry was worth $6.8 million in 2010.<ref>{{Citation\n | first       = Caroline\n | last        = Jaine\n | authorlink  =\n | title       = Doing business with Pakistan\n | url         = http://www.dawn.com/news/663807/doing-business-with-pakistan\n | publisher   = [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]\n | date        = 2011-10-04\n | accessdate  = 2013-02-02\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n | last        = Abbas\n | first       = Nosheen\n | title       = The thriving bagpipe business of Pakistan\n | url         = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20876096\n | work   = [[BBC News Online]]\n | location    = [[Pakistan]]\n | date        = 2012-12-31\n | accessdate  = 2013-01-02\n }}</ref> In the late 20th century, various models of [[electronic bagpipes]] were invented.

The name bagpipe has almost become synonymous with its best-known form, the [[Great Highland bagpipe]], overshadowing the great number and variety of traditional forms of bagpipe. Despite the decline of these other types of pipes over the last few centuries, in recent years many of these pipes have seen a resurgence or revival as musicians have sought them out; for example, the [[Uilleann pipes|Irish piping tradition]], which by the mid 20th century had declined to a handful of master players is today alive, well, and flourishing a situation similar to that of the [[gaita asturiana|Asturian gaita]], the [[Galician gaita]], the Portuguese [[gaita transmontana]], the [[Aragon]]ese [[gaita de boto]], [[Northumbrian smallpipe]]s, the [[Breton people|Breton]] [[biniou]], the [[Balkan]] [[gaida]], the [[Romanians|Romanian]] [[cimpoi]],  the Black Sea [[Tulum (bagpipe)|tulum]], the [[Scottish smallpipes]] and [[pastoral pipes]], as well as other varieties.[[File:Thechanter.jpg|thumb|A Great Highland bagpipe [[practice chanter]]]]Traditionally, one of the purposes of the bagpipe was to provide music for dancing. This has declined with the growth of dance bands, recordings, and the decline of traditional dance. In turn, this has led to many types of pipes developing a performance-led tradition, and indeed much modern music based on the dance music tradition played on bagpipes is no longer suitable for use as dance music.\n\n====Image gallery====\n<gallery>\nFile:BulgarianKabaGaidaPlayer.jpg|Bulgarian [[Kaba gaida]] player.\nFile:Bag piper, Padre, Currie Hall, Royal Military College of Canada, fall 2011.jpg|The Scottish Great Highland bagpipe played at a Canadian military function.\nFile:Baghet suonatore.jpg|A musician with a Northern Italian [[Bagh\u00e8t]] wearing traditional dress.\nFile:A modern model of Bagh\u00e8t.png|Modern Bagh\u00e8t (made 2000 by Valter Biella) in G.\nFile:Zampogna.jpg|Central and southern Italian [[zampogna]].\nFile:Tulumcu.jpg|[[Laz people|Laz]] man from Turkey playing a [[Tulum (bagpipe)|tulum]].\nFile:Cillian Vallely on Uilleann Pipes.jpg|[[Cillian Vallely]] playing Irish Uilleann pipes.\nFile:Tickell 2004.jpg|[[Kathryn Tickell]] playing [[Northumbrian smallpipes]].\nFile:Gaida.jpg|Man from Skopje, North Macedonia playing the [[Gaida]].\nFile:Seivane1.jpg|[[Galician gaita]].\nFile:Sruti upanga.jpg|[[Sruti upanga]], a Southern Indian bagpipe.\nFile:Duda Bagpipe 001.jpg|Hungarian [[duda]].\nFile:Serbian bagpiper.jpg|Serbian piper.\nFile:DudyWielkopolskie.jpg|Polish pipers.\nFile:Bagad.JPG|[[Bagad]] of Lann Bihou\u00e9 from the French Navy.\nFile:Ollegallmo.jpg|Swedish [[s\u00e4ckpipa]].\nFile:Pastoral pipes removable foot joint.JPG|[[Pastoral pipes]] with removable footjoint and bellows.\nFile:Street-piper.jpg|Street piper from Sofia, Bulgaria.\nFile:Torupillim\u00e4ngija.jpg|Estonian [[torupill]] player.\nFile:Lithuanian bagpipes.png|Lithuanian piper.\nFile:Modern huemmelchen.jpg|Modern German [[huemmelchen]].\nFile:Lietuvi\u0161kas d\u016bdmai\u0161is (LNM).jpg|Lithuanian bagpipes.\nFile:Al son de la gaita.jpg|[[Gaita asturiana]].\nFile:Pibecwd.jpg|[[Welsh bagpipes]] (double-reed type).\nFile:Gaiteroscantabria.jpg|Cantabrian pipe band.\nFile:Bagpipe player damascus.jpg|Syrian piper in Damascus, Syria.\nFile:Tsambouna.jpg|Various forms of the [[Tsampouna]], found in the Greek islands.\nFile:\u0421\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0456\u043d \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0443\u0434\u0437\u0435.jpg|Belarusian piper.\nFile:A \u017caqq (bagpipe), made from calf pelt, cane, and animal horn.jpg|Maltese [[\u017baqq]].\nFile:Bagpipe player Dam.jpg|Piper playing by the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]].\nFile:Cimpoi.png|Romanian [[cimpoi]] player.\nFile:\u013dubom\u00edr P\u00e1ri\u010dka gra na dudach.webm|\u013dubom\u00edr P\u00e1ri\u010dka playing bagpipes, Slovak Republic.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Usage in non-traditional music ===\n{{Main|List of nontraditional bagpipe usage}}\n[[File:Enter The Haggis Bagpipe.jpg|thumb|right|Celtic rock band [[Enter the Haggis]] featuring Highland bagpipes]]\nSince the 1960s, bagpipes have also made appearances in other forms of music, including rock, metal, jazz, hip-hop, punk, and classical music, for example with [[Paul McCartney]]'s \"[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]\", [[AC/DC]]'s \"[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)]]\", and [[Peter Maxwell Davies]]'s composition ''[[An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise]]''. <!--STRONGLY RECOMMEND NO MORE THAN THREE EXAMPLES TO BE PLACED IN THIS PARAGRAPH, PARTICULARLY AS THERE IS A LINK TO A COMPREHENSIVE LIST.

The Scottish [[Great Highland bagpipe]]s are the best known examples in the [[Anglophone world]]; however, people have played bagpipes for millennia, and they occur throughout large parts of [[Europe]], [[northern Africa]], and [[western Asia]], including [[Anatolia]], the [[Caucasus]], and around the [[Persian Gulf]]. The term ''bagpipe'' is equally correct in the singular or plural, though pipers usually refer to the bagpipes as \"the pipes\", \"a set of pipes\" or \"a stand of pipes\".\n\n== Construction ==\n{|align=right\n|{{Listen|filename=Skye Boat Song.ogg|title=Skye Boat Song|description=An adaptation of the \"[[Skye Boat Song]]\" for Great Highland bagpipes played by the Clan Stewart Pipe Band.}}\n|}\n[[File:Cantiga bagpipes 1.jpg|thumb|right|A detail from the [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]  showing bagpipes with one chanter and a parallel drone (Spain, 13th century).]]\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 068.jpg|thumb|right|A detail from a painting by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] showing two bagpipers (15th century).]]\nA set of bagpipes minimally consists of an air supply, a bag, a [[chanter]], and usually at least one [[Drone (music)|drone]]. Many bagpipes have more than one drone (and, sometimes, more than one chanter) in various combinations, held in place in stocks\u2014sockets that fasten the various pipes to the bag.\n\n=== Air supply ===\nThe most common method of supplying air to the bag is through blowing into a blowpipe or blowstick. In some pipes the player must cover the tip of the blowpipe with their tongue while inhaling, but most blowpipes have a [[non-return valve]] that eliminates this need. In recent times, there are many instruments that assist in creating a clean air flow to the pipes and assist the collection of condensation.\n\nAn innovation, dating from the 16th or 17th century, is the use of a [[bellows]] to supply air. In these pipes, sometimes called \"[[cauld wind pipes (disambiguation)|cauld wind pipes]]\", air is not heated or moistened by the player's breathing, so bellows-driven bagpipes can use more refined or delicate reeds. Such pipes include the Irish [[uilleann pipes]]; the [[border pipes|border or Lowland pipes]], [[Scottish smallpipes]], [[Northumbrian smallpipes]], [[pastoral pipes]] in Britain; and the [[musette de cour]], the [[musette bechonnet]] and the [[cabrette]] in France, the [[Dudy wielkopolskie]], [[koziol bialy]] and [[koziol czarny]] in Poland.\n\n=== Bag ===\nThe bag is an airtight [[reservoir]] that holds air and regulates its flow via arm pressure, allowing the player to maintain continuous even sound. The player keeps the bag inflated by blowing air into it through a blowpipe or pumping air into it with a bellows. Materials used for bags vary widely, but the most common are the skins of local animals such as goats, dogs, sheep, and cows. More recently, bags made of synthetic materials including [[Gore-Tex]] have become much more common. A drawback of the synthetic bag is the potential for fungal spores to colonise the bag because of a reduction in necessary cleaning, with the associated danger of [[Respiratory tract infection|lung infection]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/scotland/bagpipe-warning-over-threat-of-fatal-fungus-1-2828835 |title=Bagpipe warning over threat of fatal fungus \u2013 Health |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=2013-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref> An advantage of a synthetic bag is that it has a zip which allows the user to fit a more effective moisture trap to the inside of the bag.\n\nBags cut from larger materials are usually [[saddle stitch|saddle-stitched]] with an extra strip folded over the seam and stitched (for skin bags) or glued (for synthetic bags) to reduce leaks. Holes are then cut to accommodate the stocks. In the case of bags made from largely intact animal skins, the stocks are typically tied into the points where the limbs and the head joined the body of the whole animal, a construction technique common in Central Europe.\n\n=== Chanter ===\n{{Main|Chanter}}\nThe chanter is the [[melody]] pipe, played with two hands. Almost all bagpipes have at least one chanter; some pipes have two chanters, particularly those in North Africa, in the Balkans, and in Southwest Asia. A chanter can be bored internally so that the inside walls are parallel (or \"cylindrical\") for its full length, or it can be bored in a conical shape.\n\nThe chanter is usually open-ended, so there is no easy way for the player to stop the pipe from sounding. Thus most bagpipes share a constant, [[legato]] sound where there are no rests in the music. Primarily because of this inability to stop playing, technical movements are used to break up notes and to create the illusion of articulation and accents. Because of their importance, these embellishments (or \"ornaments\") are often highly technical systems specific to each bagpipe, and take many years of study to master. A few bagpipes (such as the musette de cour, the [[uilleann pipes]], the Northumbrian smallpipes, the [[Piva (bagpipe)|piva]] and the left chanter of the [[surdelina]]) have closed ends or stop the end on the player's leg, so that when the player \"closes\" (covers all the holes) the chanter becomes silent.\n\nA [[practice chanter]] is a chanter without bag or drones, allowing a player to practice the instrument quietly and with no variables other than playing the chanter.\n\nThe term ''chanter'' is derived from the Latin ''cantare'', or \"to sing\", much like the modern French word ''[[wikt:chanteur#French|chanteur]]''.\n\n==== Chanter reed ====\nThe note from the chanter is produced by a [[Reed (instrument)|reed]] installed at its top. The reed may be a [[Single-reed instrument|single]] (a reed with one vibrating tongue) or [[double reed]] (of two pieces that vibrate against each other). Double reeds are used with both conical- and parallel-bored chanters while single reeds are generally (although not exclusively) limited to parallel-bored chanters. In general, double-reed chanters are found in pipes of Western Europe while single-reed chanters appear in most other regions.\n\n=== Drone ===\nMost bagpipes have at least one [[drone (music)|drone]]: a pipe which is generally not fingered but rather produces a constant harmonizing note throughout play (usually the tonic note of the chanter). Exceptions are generally those pipes which have a double-chanter instead. A drone is most commonly a cylindrically-bored tube with a single reed, although drones with double reeds exist. The drone is generally designed in two or more parts with a sliding joint so that the pitch of the drone can be adjusted.\n\nDepending on the type of pipes, the drones may lie over the shoulder, across the arm opposite the bag, or may run parallel to the chanter. Some drones have a tuning screw, which effectively alters the length of the drone by opening a hole, allowing the drone to be tuned to two or more distinct pitches. The tuning screw may also shut off the drone altogether. In most types of pipes, where there is one drone it is pitched two octaves below the tonic of the chanter. Additional drones often add the octave below and then a drone consonant with the fifth of the chanter.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Ancient origins ===\nThe evidence for pre-Roman era bagpipes is still uncertain but several textual and visual clues have been suggested. The ''Oxford History of Music''  says that a sculpture of bagpipes has been found on a [[Hittites|Hittite]] slab at [[Euyuk]] in Anatolia, dated to 1000 BC. Several authors identify the [[ancient Greek]] ''askaulos'' (\u1f00\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''askos'' &ndash; [[wine-skin]], \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 ''[[aulos]]'' &ndash; reed pipe) with the bagpipe.<ref name=\"google15\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=DOfuAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA15 William Flood. \"The Story of the Bagpipe\" p. 15]</ref>  In the 2nd century AD, [[Suetonius]] described the Roman emperor [[Nero]] as a player of the ''tibia utricularis''.<ref>{{Citation\n | title       = ''Life of Nero'', 54\n | url         = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#54\n | publisher   = [[Loeb Classical Library]]\n | work       = Suetonius, The Lives of the Caesars\n | page        = 185\n | date        =\n | accessdate  = 2013-01-02\n}}</ref> [[Dio Chrysostom]] wrote in the 1st century of a contemporary sovereign (possibly Nero) who could play a pipe ([[Tibia (instrument)|tibia]], Roman reedpipes similar to Greek and Etruscan instruments) with his mouth as well as by tucking a bladder beneath his armpit.<ref>{{Citation\n | title       = Discourses by Dio Chrysostom (Or.&nbsp;71.9)\n | url         = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/71*.html#9\n | publisher   = [[Loeb Classical Library]]\n | work       = The Seventy-first Discourse: On the Philosopher (Volume V)\n | volume      = V\n | page        = 173\n | date        =\n | accessdate  = 2013-01-02\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Spread and development in Europe ===\n[[File:Santes Creus Bagpiper.JPG|thumb|left|Medieval bagpiper at the [[Cistercian]] monastery of [[Santes Creus]], Catalonia, Spain]]\n[[File:The Image of Irelande - plate02.jpg|right|thumb|''Image of Irelande'', Military use of the bagpipe dated 1581]]\n\nIn the early part of the second millennium, definite clear attestations of bagpipes began to appear with frequency in Western European art and iconography.

In 1760, the first serious study of the Scottish Highland bagpipe and its music was attempted, in Joseph MacDonald's ''Compleat Theory''. Further south, a manuscript from the 1730s by a [[William Dixon manuscript|William Dixon]] from [[Northumberland]] contains music that fits the [[border pipes]], a nine-note bellows-blown bagpipe whose chanter is similar to that of the modern [[Great Highland bagpipe]]. However the music in Dixon's manuscript varied greatly from modern Highland bagpipe tunes, consisting mostly of extended variation sets of common dance tunes. Some of the tunes in the Dixon manuscript correspond to tunes found in early 19th century published and manuscript sources of [[Northumbrian smallpipe]] tunes, notably the rare book of 50 tunes, many with variations, by John Peacock.''\n[[File:Merry brothers 1887.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Happy Brothers]]'' by [[Uro\u0161 Predi\u0107]] (1887)]]\nAs Western classical music developed, both in terms of musical sophistication and instrumental technology, bagpipes in many regions fell out of favour due to their limited range and function. This triggered a long, slow decline that continued, in most cases, into the 20th century.\n\nExtensive and documented collections of traditional bagpipes can be found in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[International Bagpipe Museum]] in [[Gij\u00f3n]], Spain, the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]] in Oxford, England and the [[Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum]] in Northumberland, and the [[Musical Instrument Museum (Phoenix)|Musical Instrument Museum]] in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n[[File:MDF Strakonice 2018 09 Anglie 02.jpg|thumb|left|International Bagpipe Festival, Strakonice, 2018]]\n\nThe [[International Bagpipe Festival]] (''Mezin\u00e1rodn\u00ed dud\u00e1ck\u00fd festival'', '''IBF''', '''MDF''') is held every two years in [[Strakonice]], [[Czech Republic]].\n\n=== Recent history ===\n[[File:Afghanistan bagpiper.jpg|thumb|right|A Canadian soldier plays the bagpipes during the War in Afghanistan. Bagpipes are frequently used during funerals and memorials, especially among fire department, military and police forces in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Commonwealth realms, and the US.]]\nDuring the expansion of the British Empire, spearheaded by British military forces that included [[Scottish regiment#Highland Regiments|Highland regiments]], the Scottish Great Highland bagpipe became well known worldwide. This surge in popularity was boosted by large numbers of pipers trained for military service in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The surge coincided with a decline in the popularity of many traditional forms of bagpipe throughout Europe, which began to be displaced by instruments from the classical tradition and later by gramophone and radio.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and [[Commonwealth Nations]] such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia the [[Great Highland bagpipe]] is commonly used in the military and is often played in formal ceremonies. Foreign militaries patterned after the British Army have also taken the Highland bagpipe into use including Uganda, Sudan, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Jordan, and Oman. Many police and fire services in Scotland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and the United States have also adopted the tradition of fielding pipe bands.\n\n[[File:Bagad Brest.jpg|thumb|left|A [[bagad]] in [[Brest, France]]]]\nIn recent years, often driven by revivals of native folk music and dance, many types of bagpipes have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity and, in many cases, instruments that were on the brink of obscurity have become extremely popular. In [[Brittany]], the Great Highland bagpipe and concept of the [[pipe band]] were appropriated to create a Breton interpretation, the [[bagad]]. The pipe band idiom has also been adopted and applied to the [[Galician bagpipe|Galician gaita]] as well. Additionally, bagpipes have often been used in various films depicting moments from Scottish and Irish history; the film ''[[Braveheart]]'' and the theatrical show ''[[Riverdance]]'' have served to make the uilleann pipes more commonly known.\n\nBagpipes are sometimes played at formal events in Commonwealth universities, particularly in Canada. Because of the Scottish influences on the sport of [[curling]], bagpipes are also the official instrument of the [[World Curling Federation]] and are commonly played during a ceremonial procession of teams before major curling championships.\n\nBagpipe making was once a craft that produced instruments in many distinctive local traditional styles. Today, the world's biggest producer of the instrument is Pakistan, where the industry was worth $6.8 million in 2010.<ref>{{Citation\n | first       = Caroline\n | last        = Jaine\n | authorlink  =\n | title       = Doing business with Pakistan\n | url         = http://www.dawn.com/news/663807/doing-business-with-pakistan\n | publisher   = [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]\n | date        = 2011-10-04\n | accessdate  = 2013-02-02\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n | last        = Abbas\n | first       = Nosheen\n | title       = The thriving bagpipe business of Pakistan\n | url         = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20876096\n | work   = [[BBC News Online]]\n | location    = [[Pakistan]]\n | date        = 2012-12-31\n | accessdate  = 2013-01-02\n }}</ref> In the late 20th century, various models of [[electronic bagpipes]] were invented.

The name bagpipe has almost become synonymous with its best-known form, the [[Great Highland bagpipe]], overshadowing the great number and variety of traditional forms of bagpipe. Despite the decline of these other types of pipes over the last few centuries, in recent years many of these pipes have seen a resurgence or revival as musicians have sought them out; for example, the [[Uilleann pipes|Irish piping tradition]], which by the mid 20th century had declined to a handful of master players is today alive, well, and flourishing a situation similar to that of the [[gaita asturiana|Asturian gaita]], the [[Galician gaita]], the Portuguese [[gaita transmontana]], the [[Aragon]]ese [[gaita de boto]], [[Northumbrian smallpipe]]s, the [[Breton people|Breton]] [[biniou]], the [[Balkan]] [[gaida]], the [[Romanians|Romanian]] [[cimpoi]],  the Black Sea [[Tulum (bagpipe)|tulum]], the [[Scottish smallpipes]] and [[pastoral pipes]], as well as other varieties.[[File:Thechanter.jpg|thumb|A Great Highland bagpipe [[practice chanter]]]]Traditionally, one of the purposes of the bagpipe was to provide music for dancing. This has declined with the growth of dance bands, recordings, and the decline of traditional dance. In turn, this has led to many types of pipes developing a performance-led tradition, and indeed much modern music based on the dance music tradition played on bagpipes is no longer suitable for use as dance music.\n\n====Image gallery====\n<gallery>\nFile:BulgarianKabaGaidaPlayer.jpg|Bulgarian [[Kaba gaida]] player.\nFile:Bag piper, Padre, Currie Hall, Royal Military College of Canada, fall 2011.jpg|The Scottish Great Highland bagpipe played at a Canadian military function.\nFile:Baghet suonatore.jpg|A musician with a Northern Italian [[Bagh\u00e8t]] wearing traditional dress.\nFile:A modern model of Bagh\u00e8t.png|Modern Bagh\u00e8t (made 2000 by Valter Biella) in G.\nFile:Zampogna.jpg|Central and southern Italian [[zampogna]].\nFile:Tulumcu.jpg|[[Laz people|Laz]] man from Turkey playing a [[Tulum (bagpipe)|tulum]].\nFile:Cillian Vallely on Uilleann Pipes.jpg|[[Cillian Vallely]] playing Irish Uilleann pipes.\nFile:Tickell 2004.jpg|[[Kathryn Tickell]] playing [[Northumbrian smallpipes]].\nFile:Gaida.jpg|Man from Skopje, North Macedonia playing the [[Gaida]].\nFile:Seivane1.jpg|[[Galician gaita]].\nFile:Sruti upanga.jpg|[[Sruti upanga]], a Southern Indian bagpipe.\nFile:Duda Bagpipe 001.jpg|Hungarian [[duda]].\nFile:Serbian bagpiper.jpg|Serbian piper.\nFile:DudyWielkopolskie.jpg|Polish pipers.\nFile:Bagad.JPG|[[Bagad]] of Lann Bihou\u00e9 from the French Navy.\nFile:Ollegallmo.jpg|Swedish [[s\u00e4ckpipa]].\nFile:Pastoral pipes removable foot joint.JPG|[[Pastoral pipes]] with removable footjoint and bellows.\nFile:Street-piper.jpg|Street piper from Sofia, Bulgaria.\nFile:Torupillim\u00e4ngija.jpg|Estonian [[torupill]] player.\nFile:Lithuanian bagpipes.png|Lithuanian piper.\nFile:Modern huemmelchen.jpg|Modern German [[huemmelchen]].\nFile:Lietuvi\u0161kas d\u016bdmai\u0161is (LNM).jpg|Lithuanian bagpipes.\nFile:Al son de la gaita.jpg|[[Gaita asturiana]].\nFile:Pibecwd.jpg|[[Welsh bagpipes]] (double-reed type).\nFile:Gaiteroscantabria.jpg|Cantabrian pipe band.\nFile:Bagpipe player damascus.jpg|Syrian piper in Damascus, Syria.\nFile:Tsambouna.jpg|Various forms of the [[Tsampouna]], found in the Greek islands.\nFile:\u0421\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0456\u043d \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0443\u0434\u0437\u0435.jpg|Belarusian piper.\nFile:A \u017caqq (bagpipe), made from calf pelt, cane, and animal horn.jpg|Maltese [[\u017baqq]].\nFile:Bagpipe player Dam.jpg|Piper playing by the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]].\nFile:Cimpoi.png|Romanian [[cimpoi]] player.\nFile:\u013dubom\u00edr P\u00e1ri\u010dka gra na dudach.webm|\u013dubom\u00edr P\u00e1ri\u010dka playing bagpipes, Slovak Republic.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Usage in non-traditional music ===\n{{Main|List of nontraditional bagpipe usage}}\n[[File:Enter The Haggis Bagpipe.jpg|thumb|right|Celtic rock band [[Enter the Haggis]] featuring Highland bagpipes]]\nSince the 1960s, bagpipes have also made appearances in other forms of music, including rock, metal, jazz, hip-hop, punk, and classical music, for example with [[Paul McCartney]]'s \"[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]\", [[AC/DC]]'s \"[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)]]\", and [[Peter Maxwell Davies]]'s composition ''[[An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise]]''. <!--STRONGLY RECOMMEND NO MORE THAN THREE EXAMPLES TO BE PLACED IN THIS PARAGRAPH, PARTICULARLY AS THERE IS A LINK TO A COMPREHENSIVE LIST.
