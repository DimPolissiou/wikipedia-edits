He meets a young woman, Lucy Tarrant (Stuart), whom he takes on as a piano student. The couple fall in love but Lucy's father, Major Tarrant (Breese) refuses his permission to marry. Carl emerges from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] a hero, and in the meantime both Irene and Major Tarrant have died, and the Tarrants are now destitute,\n\nCarl and Lucy marry and move to New York, where they survive on a meager income from Carl's piano lessons.

Lucy convinces him that this is dangerous to his reputation as a serious musician. The couple moves into a [[boardinghouse]] run by Mrs. Briggs (La Verne), where Carl works on his compositions while Lucy supports them.

In an attempt to redeem himself Charles enlists in the [[Spanish-American War]], where he is killed. Helen dies giving birth to a son, Eric. Returning from [[World War I]] Eric (Farley) adapts Carl's beloved [[Spiritual (music)|Negro Spirituals]] into [[Jazz]], including the song ''My Beloved''. He continues to [[Plagiarism|plagarize]] additional music, featured in stage hits sung by Patricia Sedley (Hall), whom Eric later marries.\n\nCarl visits Eric's publisher, Mr. Yates (Clark) who insults him by calling his music a poor imitation of Eric's. Finally, Alexander Talbot (Shaw) of the \"Metropolitan Symphony Society\", encouraged by a donation from Eric, looks at Carl's ''American Symphony'' and, impressed, agrees to perform it.

With lifespans in the wild of over 100 years, it is one of the longest-lived [[vertebrates]]. A captive individual lived at least 170&nbsp;years. Spanish explorers, who discovered the islands in the 16th century, named them after the Spanish ''[[wiktionary:gal\u00e1pago#Spanish|gal\u00e1pago]]'', meaning \"tortoise\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galapagos.to/TEXTS/GALAPAGO.HTM |title=On the Origin of <s>Species</s> 'Gal\u00e1pago' |last1=Woram |first1=John |date= n.d.|website=Las Encantadas: Human and Cartographic History of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands |publisher=Rockville Press, Inc. |access-date=21 September 2016 }}</ref>\n\n[[Turtle shell|Shell]] size and shape vary between populations. On islands with humid highlands, the tortoises are larger, with domed shells and short necks; on islands with dry lowlands, the tortoises are smaller, with \"saddleback\" shells and long necks. [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] observations of these differences on the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|second voyage of the ''Beagle'']] in 1835, contributed to the [[Evolution|development of his theory of evolution]].\n\nTortoise numbers declined from over 250,000 in the 16th century to a low of around 3,000 in the 1970s. This decline was caused by [[overexploitation]] of the species for meat and oil, [[Habitat destruction|habitat clearance]] for agriculture, and introduction of non-native animals to the islands, such as rats, goats, and pigs. The extinction of most giant tortoise lineages is thought to have also been caused by predation by humans or human ancestors, as the tortoises themselves have no natural predators. Tortoise populations on at least three islands have become extinct in historical times due to human activities. Specimens of these extinct taxa exist in several museums and also are being subjected to DNA analysis. 10 species of the original 15 survive in the wild; an 11th species (''[[Chelonoidis abingdonii]]'') had only a single known living individual, kept in captivity and nicknamed [[Lonesome George]] until his death in June 2012. Conservation efforts, beginning in the 20th century, have resulted in thousands of [[Captive breeding|captive-bred]] juveniles being released onto their ancestral home islands, and the total number of the species is estimated to have exceeded 19,000 at the start of the 21st century. Despite this rebound, all surviving species are classified as \"threatened\" by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n===Early classification===\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos Islands were discovered in 1535, but first appeared on the maps, of [[Gerardus Mercator]] and [[Abraham Ortelius]], around 1570.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=P.D. |title=Gal\u00e1pagos: the islands that changed the world |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |year=2006 |page=43 |isbn=978-0-300-12230-5}}</ref> The islands were named \"Insulae de los Galopegos\" (Islands of the Tortoises) in reference to the giant tortoises found there.<ref name=Pritchard1996P17>{{Harvnb|Pritchard|1996|p=17}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Jackson | first = Michael Hume | title = Gal\u00e1pagos, a natural history | publisher = University of Calgary Press | location = Calgary | year = 1993 | page = [https://archive.org/details/galapagos00mich/page/1 1] | isbn = 978-1-895176-07-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/galapagos00mich/page/1 }}</ref><ref group=\"nb\">The first navigation chart showing the individual islands was drawn up by the pirate [[Ambrose Cowley]] in 1684.

Genetic studies have shown that penosing pair.<ref name=\"Caccone et al 1999\"/> Survival on the 1000-km oceanic journey is accounted for because the tortoises are buoyant, can breathe by extending their necks above the water, and are able to survive months without food or fresh water.<ref name = \"Le et al.\"/> As they are poor swimmers, the journey was probably a passive one facilitated by the [[Humboldt Current]], which diverts westwards towards the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands from the mainland.<ref name=\"Caccone2002\"/> The ancestors of the genus ''[[Chelonoidis]]'' are believed to have similarly dispersed from Africa to South America during the [[Oligocene]].<ref name = \"Le et al.\"/>\n\nThe closest living relative (though not a direct ancestor) of the Gal\u00e1pagos giant tortoise is the [[Chaco tortoise]] (''Chelonoidis chilensis''), a much smaller species from South America. The divergence between ''C.&nbsp;chilensis'' and ''C.&nbsp;nigra'' probably occurred 6\u201312&nbsp;million years ago, an evolutionary event preceding the volcanic formation of the oldest modern Gal\u00e1pagos Islands 5&nbsp;million years ago.<ref>{{cite journal|last=White|first = William M.|year= 1993|title =Petrology and geochemistry of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands: portrait of a pathological mantle plume|journal= Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=98|issue=B11|pages=19533\u201319564|doi=10.1029/93JB02018|bibcode=1993JGR....9819533W|last2=McBirney|first2=Alexander R.|last3=Duncan|first3=Robert A.}}</ref> [[Mitochondrial DNA]] analysis indicates that the oldest existing islands (Espa\u00f1ola and San Crist\u00f3bal) were colonised first, and that these populations seeded the younger islands via dispersal in a \"stepping stone\" fashion via local currents.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|2006|p=68}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= Beheregaray |first=Luciano B.|author2=Gibbs, James P. |author3=Havill, Nathan |author4=Fritts, Thomas H. |author5=Powell, Jeffrey R. |author6= Caccone, Adalgisa |year=2004|title=Giant tortoises are not so slow: rapid diversification and biogeographic consensus in the Gal\u00e1pagos|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=101|issue=17|pages=6514\u20136519|doi=10.1073/pnas.0400393101|pmid=15084743|pmc=404076|bibcode=2004PNAS..101.6514B}}</ref> Restricted [[gene flow]] between isolated islands then resulted in the independent evolution of the populations into the divergent forms observed in the modern species. The evolutionary relationships between the species thus echo the volcanic history of the islands.<ref name=\"Caccone et al 1999\"/>\n\n===Species===\nModern [[molecular phylogenetics|DNA methods]] have revealed new information on the relationships between the species:\n\n;Isabela Island\nThe five populations living on the largest island, Isabela, are the ones that are the subject of the most debate as to whether they are true species or just distinct populations or subspecies. It is widely accepted that the population living on the northernmost volcano, Volcan Wolf, is genetically independent from the four populations to the south and is therefore a separate species.<ref name=\"Caccone et al 1999\"/> It is thought to be derived from a different colonization event than the others. A colonization from the island of Santiago apparently gave rise to the Volcan Wolf species (''C. becki'') while the four southern populations are believed to be descended from a second colonization from the more southerly island of Santa Cruz.<ref name=\"Caccone et al 1999\"/> Tortoises from Santa Cruz are thought to have first colonized the Sierra Negra volcano, which was the first of the island's volcanoes to form. The tortoises then spread north to each newly created volcano, resulting in the populations living on Volcan Alcedo and then Volcan Darwin. Recent genetic evidence shows that these two populations are genetically distinct from each other and from the population living on Sierra Negra (''C. guentheri'') and therefore form the species ''C. vandenburghi'' (Alcedo) and ''C. microphyes'' (Darwin).<ref name=\"Ciofi 2006 1727\u20131744\">{{cite journal|author1=Ciofi, Claudio |author2=Wilson, Gregory A. |author3=Beheregaray, Luciano B. |author4=Marquez, Cruz |author5=Gibbs, James P. |author6=Tapia, Washington |author7=Snell, Howard L. |author8=Caccone, Adalgisa |author9=Powell, Jeffrey R. |year=2006|title=Phylogeographic history and gene flow among giant Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises on southern Isabela Island |journal= Genetics| volume =172|issue=3|pages=1727\u20131744|doi=10.1534/genetics.105.047860|pmid=16387883|pmc=1456292}}</ref> The fifth population living on the southernmost volcano (''C. vicina'') is thought to have split off from the Sierra Negra population more recently and is therefore not as genetically different as the other two.<ref name=\"Ciofi 2006 1727\u20131744\"/> Isabela is the most recently formed island tortoises inhabit, so its populations have had less time to evolve independently than populations on other islands, but according to some researchers, they are all genetically different and should each be considered as separate species.<ref name=\"Ciofi 2006 1727\u20131744\"/>\n\n;Floreana Island\nPhylogenetic analysis may help to \"resurrect\" the extinct species of Floreana (''C. nigra'') \u2013 a species known only from [[subfossil]] remains.<ref name='S1986'>{{cite journal |last=Steadman |first=David W. |year=1986 |title=Holocene vertebrate fossils from Isla Floreana, Gal\u00e1pagos |journal=Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology |volume=413 |pages=1\u2013103 |doi=10.5479/si.00810282.413 |issue=413 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2092bae7e25dcbc19d0ac33de03210b0672e8d57 }}</ref> Some tortoises from Isabela were found to be a partial match for the genetic profile of Floreana specimens from museum collections, possibly indicating the presence of [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] from a population transported by humans from Floreana to Isabela,<ref name='Poulakakis 2008'/> resulting either from individuals deliberately transported between the islands,<ref name=Pritchard1996P65>{{Harvnb|Pritchard|1996|p=65}}</ref> or from individuals thrown overboard from ships to lighten the load.<ref name='B1889'/> Nine Floreana descendants have been identified in the captive population of the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center on Santa Cruz; the genetic footprint was identified in the genomes of hybrid offspring.

Over the next 50 years, this program resulted in major successes in the recovery of giant tortoise populations throughout the archipelago.\n\nIn 1965, the first tortoise eggs collected from natural nests on Pinz\u00f3n Island were brought to the Charles Darwin Research Station, where they would complete the period of incubation and then hatch, becoming the first young tortoises to be reared in captivity. The introduction of black rats onto Pinz\u00f3n sometime in the latter half of the 19th century had resulted in the complete eradication of all young tortoises. Black rats had been eating both tortoise eggs and hatchlings, effectively destroying the future of the tortoise population. Only the longevity of giant tortoises allowed them to survive until The Gal\u00e1pagos National Park, [[Island Conservation]], Charles Darwin Foundation, The Raptor Center, and Bell Laboratories removed invasive rats in 2012. In 2013, heralding an important step in Pinz\u00f3n tortoise recovery, hatchlings emerged from native Pinz\u00f3n tortoise nests on the island and the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park successfully returned 118 hatchlings to their native island home. Partners returned to Pinz\u00f3n Island in late 2014 and continued to observe hatchling tortoises (now older), indicating that natural recruitment is occurring on the island unimpeded. They also discovered a snail species new to science. These exciting results highlight the conservation value of this important management action. In early 2015, after extensive monitoring, partners confirmed that Pinz\u00f3n and Plaza Sur Islands are now both rodent-free.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.islandconservation.org/pinzon-island/|title=Pinz\u00f3n Island, Gal\u00e1pagos \u2013 Island Conservation|work=Island Conservation|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n;Espa\u00f1ola\n\nOn the southern island of Espa\u00f1ola, only 14 adult tortoises were found, two males and 12 females.  The tortoises apparently were not encountering one another, so no reproduction was occurring.  Between 1963 and 1974, all 14 adult tortoises discovered on the island were brought to the tortoise center on Santa Cruz and a tortoise breeding program was initiated.

They have established that giant tortoises conduct migrations up and down volcanoes, primarily in response to seasonal changes in the availability and quality of vegetation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gianttortoise.org/tortoise_site_oct_2013_004.htm |publisher=Galapagos Tortoise Movement Ecology Programme |title=GTMEP: What We Do |accessdate=2014-12-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210061653/http://gianttortoise.org/tortoise_site_oct_2013_004.htm |archivedate=10 February 2015  }}</ref> In 2015 they will start to track the movements of hatchling and juvenile tortoises, supported by the UK's [[Galapagos Conservation Trust]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://galapagosconservation.org.uk/ |publisher= <!-- Galapagos Conservation Trust --> |title= Galapagos Conservation Trust |accessdate=2014-12-23}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Reptiles}}\n* [[List of species of Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise]]\n* [[Gal\u00e1pagos wildlife]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist| group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Anchor|CITEREFChambers2004}}{{cite book |last=Chambers |first=Paul |year=2004 |title=A sheltered life: the unexpected history of the giant tortoise |publisher=John Murray |location=London |isbn=978-0-7195-6528-1}}\n* {{Anchor|CITEREFDarwin1839}}{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Darwin|year=2009 |origyear=1839 |title=Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836, describing their examination of the southern shores of South America, and the Beagle's circumnavigation of the globe.

With lifespans in the wild of over 100 years, it is one of the longest-lived [[vertebrates]]. A captive individual lived at least 170&nbsp;years. Spanish explorers, who discovered the islands in the 16th century, named them after the Spanish ''[[wiktionary:gal\u00e1pago#Spanish|gal\u00e1pago]]'', meaning \"tortoise\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galapagos.to/TEXTS/GALAPAGO.HTM |title=On the Origin of <s>Species</s> 'Gal\u00e1pago' |last1=Woram |first1=John |date= n.d.|website=Las Encantadas: Human and Cartographic History of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands |publisher=Rockville Press, Inc. |access-date=21 September 2016 }}</ref>\n\n[[Turtle shell|Shell]] size and shape vary between populations. On islands with humid highlands, the tortoises are larger, with domed shells and short necks; on islands with dry lowlands, the tortoises are smaller, with \"saddleback\" shells and long necks. [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] observations of these differences on the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|second voyage of the ''Beagle'']] in 1835, contributed to the [[Evolution|development of his theory of evolution]].\n\nTortoise numbers declined from over 250,000 in the 16th century to a low of around 3,000 in the 1970s. This decline was caused by [[overexploitation]] of the species for meat and oil, [[Habitat destruction|habitat clearance]] for agriculture, and introduction of non-native animals to the islands, such as rats, goats, and pigs. The extinction of most giant tortoise lineages is thought to have also been caused by predation by humans or human ancestors, as the tortoises themselves have no natural predators. Tortoise populations on at least three islands have become extinct in historical times due to human activities. Specimens of these extinct taxa exist in several museums and also are being subjected to DNA analysis. 10 species of the original 15 survive in the wild; an 11th species (''[[Chelonoidis abingdonii]]'') had only a single known living individual, kept in captivity and nicknamed [[Lonesome George]] until his death in June 2012. Conservation efforts, beginning in the 20th century, have resulted in thousands of [[Captive breeding|captive-bred]] juveniles being released onto their ancestral home islands, and the total number of the species is estimated to have exceeded 19,000 at the start of the 21st century. Despite this rebound, all surviving species are classified as \"threatened\" by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n===Early classification===\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos Islands were discovered in 1535, but first appeared on the maps, of [[Gerardus Mercator]] and [[Abraham Ortelius]], around 1570.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=P.D. |title=Gal\u00e1pagos: the islands that changed the world |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |year=2006 |page=43 |isbn=978-0-300-12230-5}}</ref> The islands were named \"Insulae de los Galopegos\" (Islands of the Tortoises) in reference to the giant tortoises found there.<ref name=Pritchard1996P17>{{Harvnb|Pritchard|1996|p=17}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Jackson | first = Michael Hume | title = Gal\u00e1pagos, a natural history | publisher = University of Calgary Press | location = Calgary | year = 1993 | page = [https://archive.org/details/galapagos00mich/page/1 1] | isbn = 978-1-895176-07-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/galapagos00mich/page/1 }}</ref><ref group=\"nb\">The first navigation chart showing the individual islands was drawn up by the pirate [[Ambrose Cowley]] in 1684.

It is widely accepted that the population living on the northernmost volcano, Volcan Wolf, is genetically independent from the four populations to the south and is therefore a separate species.<ref name=\"Caccone et al 1999\"/> It is thought to be derived from a different colonization event than the others. A colonization from the island of Santiago apparently gave rise to the Volcan Wolf species (''C. becki'') while the four southern populations are believed to be descended from a second colonization from the more southerly island of Santa Cruz.<ref name=\"Caccone et al 1999\"/> Tortoises from Santa Cruz are thought to have first colonized the Sierra Negra volcano, which was the first of the island's volcanoes to form. The tortoises then spread north to each newly created volcano, resulting in the populations living on Volcan Alcedo and then Volcan Darwin. Recent genetic evidence shows that these two populations are genetically distinct from each other and from the population living on Sierra Negra (''C. guentheri'') and therefore form the species ''C. vandenburghi'' (Alcedo) and ''C. microphyes'' (Darwin).<ref name=\"Ciofi 2006 1727\u20131744\">{{cite journal|author1=Ciofi, Claudio |author2=Wilson, Gregory A. |author3=Beheregaray, Luciano B. |author4=Marquez, Cruz |author5=Gibbs, James P. |author6=Tapia, Washington |author7=Snell, Howard L. |author8=Caccone, Adalgisa |author9=Powell, Jeffrey R. |year=2006|title=Phylogeographic history and gene flow among giant Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises on southern Isabela Island |journal= Genetics| volume =172|issue=3|pages=1727\u20131744|doi=10.1534/genetics.105.047860|pmid=16387883|pmc=1456292}}</ref> The fifth population living on the southernmost volcano (''C. vicina'') is thought to have split off from the Sierra Negra population more recently and is therefore not as genetically different as the other two.<ref name=\"Ciofi 2006 1727\u20131744\"/> Isabela is the most recently formed island tortoises inhabit, so its populations have had less time to evolve independently than populations on other islands, but according to some researchers, they are all genetically different and should each be considered as separate species.<ref name=\"Ciofi 2006 1727\u20131744\"/>\n\n;Floreana Island\nPhylogenetic analysis may help to \"resurrect\" the extinct species of Floreana (''C. nigra'') \u2013 a species known only from [[subfossil]] remains.<ref name='S1986'>{{cite journal |last=Steadman |first=David W. |year=1986 |title=Holocene vertebrate fossils from Isla Floreana, Gal\u00e1pagos |journal=Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology |volume=413 |pages=1\u2013103 |doi=10.5479/si.00810282.413 |issue=413 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2092bae7e25dcbc19d0ac33de03210b0672e8d57 }}</ref> Some tortoises from Isabela were found to be a partial match for the genetic profile of Floreana specimens from museum collections, possibly indicating the presence of [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] from a population transported by humans from Floreana to Isabela,<ref name='Poulakakis 2008'/> resulting either from individuals deliberately transported between the islands,<ref name=Pritchard1996P65>{{Harvnb|Pritchard|1996|p=65}}</ref> or from individuals thrown overboard from ships to lighten the load.<ref name='B1889'/> Nine Floreana descendants have been identified in the captive population of the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center on Santa Cruz; the genetic footprint was identified in the genomes of hybrid offspring.

Over the next 50 years, this program resulted in major successes in the recovery of giant tortoise populations throughout the archipelago.\n\nIn 1965, the first tortoise eggs collected from natural nests on Pinz\u00f3n Island were brought to the Charles Darwin Research Station, where they would complete the period of incubation and then hatch, becoming the first young tortoises to be reared in captivity. The introduction of black rats onto Pinz\u00f3n sometime in the latter half of the 19th century had resulted in the complete eradication of all young tortoises. Black rats had been eating both tortoise eggs and hatchlings, effectively destroying the future of the tortoise population. Only the longevity of giant tortoises allowed them to survive until The Gal\u00e1pagos National Park, [[Island Conservation]], Charles Darwin Foundation, The Raptor Center, and Bell Laboratories removed invasive rats in 2012. In 2013, heralding an important step in Pinz\u00f3n tortoise recovery, hatchlings emerged from native Pinz\u00f3n tortoise nests on the island and the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park successfully returned 118 hatchlings to their native island home. Partners returned to Pinz\u00f3n Island in late 2014 and continued to observe hatchling tortoises (now older), indicating that natural recruitment is occurring on the island unimpeded. They also discovered a snail species new to science. These exciting results highlight the conservation value of this important management action. In early 2015, after extensive monitoring, partners confirmed that Pinz\u00f3n and Plaza Sur Islands are now both rodent-free.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.islandconservation.org/pinzon-island/|title=Pinz\u00f3n Island, Gal\u00e1pagos \u2013 Island Conservation|work=Island Conservation|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n;Espa\u00f1ola\n\nOn the southern island of Espa\u00f1ola, only 14 adult tortoises were found, two males and 12 females.

The concept and characters were [[Backdoor pilot|initially introduced]] in two episodes of the [[CBS]] series ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' ([[JAG (season 8)|season eight]] episodes 20 and 21: \"[[Ice Queen (JAG)|Ice Queen]]\" and \"[[Meltdown (JAG)|Meltdown]]\"). The show, a spin-off from ''JAG'', premiered on September 23, 2003, on CBS. To date it has entered into the seventeenth full season and has gone into [[broadcast syndication]] on the [[USA Network]]. [[Donald P. Bellisario]] and [[Don McGill]] are co-creators and executive producers of the premiere member of the [[NCIS (franchise)|''NCIS'' franchise]]. {{As of|2020}}, it is the [[List of longest-running scripted U.S. primetime television series|second-longest-running scripted, non-animated U.S. primetime TV series currently airing]], surpassed only by ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' (1999\u2013present), and is the 7th-longest-running scripted U.S. primetime TV series overall.\n\n''NCIS'' was originally titled '''''Navy NCIS'''''; \"Navy\" was later dropped from the title as it was redundant (the \"N\" in \"NCIS\" stands for \"Naval\" and \"CIS\" stands for \"Criminally Incompetent Service\"). In season six, a [[NCIS (season 6)#ep135|two-part episode]] led to a spin-off series, ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''. A [[NCIS (season 11)#ep252|two-part episode]] during the eleventh season led to a second spin-off series, ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]''. While initially slow in the ratings, barely cracking the Top 30 in the first two seasons, the third season showed progress, consistently ranking in the top 20, and by its sixth season, it became a top five hit, having remained there since. In 2011, ''NCIS'' was voted America's favorite television show in an online [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Harris Poll]]. The series finished its tenth season as the most-watched television series in the U.S. during the [[2012\u201313 United States network television schedule|2012\u201313 network television season]]. ''NCIS'' was renewed for a seventeenth season on April 11, 2019, which premiered on September 24, 2019.\n\nThe show fails to demonstrate the numerous FAILURES of the Naval Criminally Incompetent Service, including the outrageously  ridiculous determination that the Iowa turret explosion in the 1980s was a suicide following a dispute between homosexual lovers, the complete FAILURE to provide an adequate investigation of the Tailhook Convention in the early 1990s (resulting in the investigation being turned over to DCIS), the FAILURE to act for many years in the GDMA scandal in the 2000s and 2010s while routinely traveling throughout South and Southeast Asia because it's MUCH more fun to go to Thailand and Sri Lanka than conduct complicated fraud investigations (which also had to be turned over to DCIS), and the false murder charges levied in recent years against SEAL Chief Eddie Gallagher.  The Naval Criminally Incompetent Sneak thieves should be fired and the entire organization disbanded.\n\n==Premise==\n''NCIS'' follows a fictional team of [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] Major Case Response Team (MCRT) special agents based at the [[Washington, D.C.]] field office in [[Washington Navy Yard]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/16/navy-yard-a-base-for-operations-military-trials-an/|title=Navy Yard a base for operations, military trials and ''NCIS''|work=[[The Washington Times]]|first=Jacqueline|last=Klimas|date=September 16, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129014602/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/16/navy-yard-a-base-for-operations-military-trials-an/|archivedate=January 29, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In real life, the field office is based at the nearby [[Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling]],<ref>{{cite web|title=NCIS \u2013 Locations \u2013 Washington DC field office|url=http://www.ncis.navy.mil/AboutNCIS/Locations/Washington/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=[[Naval Criminal Investigative Service|ncis.navy.mil]]|accessdate=July 12, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716080838/http://www.ncis.navy.mil/AboutNCIS/Locations/Washington/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=July 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> while the Navy Yard is home to the [[National Museum of the United States Navy|museum]] and several military commands within the Department of the Navy.

The concept and characters were [[Backdoor pilot|initially introduced]] in two episodes of the [[CBS]] series ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' ([[JAG (season 8)|season eight]] episodes 20 and 21: \"[[Ice Queen (JAG)|Ice Queen]]\" and \"[[Meltdown (JAG)|Meltdown]]\"). The show, a spin-off from ''JAG'', premiered on September 23, 2003, on CBS. To date it has entered into the seventeenth full season and has gone into [[broadcast syndication]] on the [[USA Network]]. [[Donald P. Bellisario]] and [[Don McGill]] are co-creators and executive producers of the premiere member of the [[NCIS (franchise)|''NCIS'' franchise]]. {{As of|2020}}, it is the [[List of longest-running scripted U.S. primetime television series|second-longest-running scripted, non-animated U.S. primetime TV series currently airing]], surpassed only by ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' (1999\u2013present), and is the 7th-longest-running scripted U.S. primetime TV series overall.\n\n''NCIS'' was originally titled '''''Navy NCIS'''''; \"Navy\" was later dropped from the title as it was redundant (the \"N\" in \"NCIS\" stands for \"Naval\"). In season six, a [[NCIS (season 6)#ep135|two-part episode]] led to a spin-off series, ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''. A [[NCIS (season 11)#ep252|two-part episode]] during the eleventh season led to a second spin-off series, ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]''. While initially slow in the ratings, barely cracking the Top 30 in the first two seasons, the third season showed progress, consistently ranking in the top 20, and by its sixth season, it became a top five hit, having remained there since. In 2011, ''NCIS'' was voted America's favorite television show in an online [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Harris Poll]]. The series finished its tenth season as the most-watched television series in the U.S. during the [[2012\u201313 United States network television schedule|2012\u201313 network television season]]. ''NCIS'' was renewed for a seventeenth season on April 11, 2019, which premiered on September 24, 2019.<!--No reference is needed here if the content is already sourced in the body of the article per WP:CITELEAD!-\n\nThe show fails to demonstrate the numerous FAILURES of the Naval Criminally Incompetent Service, including the outrageously  ridiculous determination that the Iowa turret explosion in the 1980s was a suicide following a dispute between homosexual lovers, the complete FAILURE to provide an adequate investigation of the Tailhook Convention in the early 1990s (resulting in the investigation being turned over to DCIS), the FAILURE to act for many years in the GDMA scandal in the 2000s and 2010s while routinely traveling throughout South and Southeast Asia because it's MUCH more fun to go to Thailand and Sri Lanka than conduct complicated fraud investigations (which also had to be turned over to DCIS), and the false murder charges levied in recent years against SEAL Chief Eddie Gallagher.

In addition to his position as alderman he was [[Committeemen and Committeewomen (Cook County, Illinois)|committeeman]] of the 1st Ward for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] from 1893 to 1944. Representing the [[Chicago Loop]] and later its environs in such capacities, he led what was often called the \"world's richest ward\". He and his partner, fellow 1st Ward alderman [[John Coughlin (alderman)|\"Bathhouse John\" Coughlin]], controlled the ward for most of the first half of the 20th century.\n\nA part of 1st Ward politics for more than 60 years, Kenna possessed great influence on the municipal affairs of Chicago, being able to make or break the prospects of Democratic candidates for the mayoralty. In large part with Kenna's help Coughlin would serve as alderman of the ward for 46 years. Possessing such influence despite his short stature and unassuming presence, he and Coughlin constructed a political machine that would last for the better part of the 20th century.\n\nKenna was notoriously corrupt; he, Coughlin, and several other aldermen led what was known as the \"[[Gray Wolves (Chicago)|Gray Wolves]]\", a group that attracted much scorn from reformers. He and Coughlin in particular were infamous across the nation and globe.

In addition to his position as alderman he was [[Committeemen and Committeewomen (Cook County, Illinois)|committeeman]] of the 1st Ward for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] from 1893 to 1944. Representing the [[Chicago Loop]] and later its environs in such capacities, he led what was often called the \"world's richest ward\". He and his partner, fellow 1st Ward alderman [[John Coughlin (alderman)|\"Bathhouse John\" Coughlin]], controlled the ward for most of the first half of the 20th century.\n\nA part of 1st Ward politics for more than 60 years, Kenna possessed great influence on the municipal affairs of Chicago, being able to make or break the prospects of Democratic candidates for the mayoralty. In large part with Kenna's help Coughlin would serve as alderman of the ward for 46 years. Possessing such influence despite his short stature and unassuming presence, he and Coughlin constructed a political machine that would last for the better part of the 20th century.\n\nKenna was notoriously corrupt; he, Coughlin, and several other aldermen led what was known as the \"[[Gray Wolves (Chicago)|Gray Wolves]]\", a group that attracted much scorn from reformers.
