The world premiere performance was held at The [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 14 October 1997.<ref name=Bill/>\n\n==History==\n\nFollowing up on 1991's ''[[Paul McCartney's Liverpool Oratorio]]'', the ''Standing Stone'' project was composed out of a long poem McCartney authored to describe the way Celtic man might have wondered about the origins of life and the mystery of existence.<ref name=Bill/> McCartney composed the work as a commission from Richard Lyttleton, the then president of EMI Classics, to celebrate EMI's centenary celebrations. Unlike ''Liverpool Oratorio'', the project was not an operatic performance of a story, but an instrumental one, though employing the use of a choir.\n\nFor the first time in his career, McCartney used a personal computer and software to help compose. The work was recorded by the 80 piece [[London Symphony Orchestra]], a 120-member choir, and conducted by [[Lawrence Foster]] at [[EMI]]'s [[Abbey Road Studios]]. Standing Stone was engineered by John Kurlander and mixed and edited at Hog Hill Mill Studios, McCartney's private studio in Sussex, England.\n\nIt was released on [[compact disc]] which included a 48-page booklet. The booklet reprinted in full McCartney's original poem that inspired the project, an essay by Andrew Stewart, and reproductions of two paintings by Paul from 1994 named Standing Stone Story and Standing Stone Story II. A two LP vinyl edition, limited to 2,500 copies, was also released.\n\nThe cover is actually one of the many photos taken by [[Linda McCartney]] during late 1969/early 1970 that would initially be seen on the inside gatefold cover of Paul's first album ''[[McCartney (album)|McCartney]]''. This project was her husband's last release before Linda died of [[breast cancer]] on 17 April 1998, having been diagnosed almost three years earlier.\n\nA documentary was made during the sessions, ''The Making of Standing Stone'', and subsequently broadcast on BBC and PBS. The world premiere performance at The Royal Albert Hall was also filmed and broadcast on Channel 5 in the UK. The concert and documentary were later released together on DVD.\n\n==Release==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r373093|first=William|last=Tilland}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev2Score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|author=Larkin, Colin|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music'' (4th edn)'' |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-531373-9 |page=1257}}</ref>\n| rev3 = [[MusicHound]]\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|2.5|5}}<ref>Graff, Gary; Durchholz, Daniel (eds) (1999).

The world premiere performance was held at The [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 14 October 1997.<ref name=Bill/>\n\n==History==\n\nFollowing up on 1991's ''[[Paul McCartney's Liverpool Oratorio]]'', the ''Standing Stone'' project was composed out of a long poem McCartney authored to describe the way Celtic man might have wondered about the origins of life and the mystery of existence.<ref name=Bill/> McCartney composed the work as a commission from Richard Lyttleton, the then president of EMI Classics, to celebrate EMI's centenary celebrations. Unlike ''Liverpool Oratorio'', the project was not an operatic performance of a story, but an instrumental one, though employing the use of a choir.\n\nFor the first time in his career, McCartney used a personal computer and software to help compose. The work was recorded by the 80 piece [[London Symphony Orchestra]], a 120 member choir, and conducted by [[Lawrence Foster]] at [[EMI]]'s [[Abbey Road Studios]]. Standing Stone was engineered by John Kurlander and mixed and edited at Hog Hill Mill Studios, McCartney's private studio in Sussex, England.\n\nIt was released on [[compact disc]] which included a 48 page booklet. The booklet reprinted in full McCartney's original poem that inspired the project, an essay by Andrew Stewart, and reproductions of two paintings by Paul from 1994 named Standing Stone Story and Standing Stone Story II. A two LP vinyl edition, limited to 2,500 copies, was also released.\n\nThe cover is actually one of the many photos taken by [[Linda McCartney]] during late 1969/early 1970 that would initially be seen on the inside gatefold cover of Paul's first album ''[[McCartney (album)|McCartney]]''. This project was her husband's last release before Linda died of [[breast cancer]] on 17 April 1998, having been diagnosed almost three years earlier.\n\nA documentary was made during the sessions, ''The Making Of Standing Stone'', and subsequently broadcast on BBC and PBS. The world premiere performance at The Royal Albert Hall was also filmed and broadcast on Channel 5 in the UK. The concert and documentary were later released together on DVD.\n\n==Release==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}} <ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r373093|first=William|last=Tilland}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev2Score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|author=Larkin, Colin|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music'' (4th edn)'' |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-531373-9 |page=1257}}</ref>\n| rev3 = [[MusicHound]]\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|2.5|5}}<ref>Graff, Gary; Durchholz, Daniel (eds) (1999).

Jackson]], [[Colin Farrell]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Josh Charles]], [[Jeremy Renner]], [[Brian Van Holt]] and [[Olivier Martinez]].\n\nIn the film, Hondo (Jackson) and his SWAT team are tasked to escort an imprisoned drug kingpin/international fugitive to prison after he offers a $100 million dollar reward to anyone who can break him out of police custody.\n\n''S.W.A.T.'' was released in the United States on August 8, 2003 and grossed $207 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nJim Street ([[Colin Farrell]]), a former [[U.S. Navy SEAL]] and hot-shot cop from the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] and his [[SWAT]] team are sent to stop a gang of robbers who have taken over a bank. His high-tempered partner and close friend Brian Gamble ([[Jeremy Renner]]) disobeys an order to hold their position and engages the bank robbers, accidentally wounding a hostage in the process. Gamble and Street are demoted by Captain Fuller ([[Larry Poindexter]]), the commanding officer of the [[LAPD Metropolitan Division]]. Gamble quits the force following an intense argument with Fuller, and Street is taken off the team and sent to work in the \"gun cage\", where he looks after the gear and weaponry. Fuller offers Street the chance to return to SWAT by selling Gamble out, but he refuses, though people refuse to trust him as his decision was never made public.\n\nSix months after the incident, the chief of police calls on Sergeant Daniel \"Hondo\" Harrelson ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]), a [[Force Recon|former Marine Force Recon]] Sergeant  who fought in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], to help re-organize the SWAT platoon. Hondo puts together a diverse team, including himself, Street, Christina Sanchez ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]), Deacon Kaye ([[LL Cool J]]), TJ McCabe ([[Josh Charles]]), and Michael Boxer ([[Brian Van Holt]]). The team members train together, eventually forging bonds of friendship. As a result, their first mission to subdue an unstable gunman is a success.\n\nMeanwhile, French [[drug lord]] Alexander \"Alex\" Montel ([[Olivier Martinez]]) arrives in Los Angeles and goes to a local restaurant to kill his uncle for holding back the family money from him. While driving to the airport, uniformed LAPD officers stop Montel for a broken tail light and later detain him to get a full positive I.D. on him; they learn through [[Interpol]] that he is an international fugitive wanted in over a dozen countries. But as Montel is being transferred to prison, his associates, dressed as LAPD officers, attempt to rescue him as he rides the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] bus. Hondo's team arrives in time to kill the two gunmen and recapture Montel. As Montel, under SWAT escort, approaches the police station, reporters crowd around them, prompting Montel to yell to the cameras that he would \"give 100 million dollars to whoever gets [him] out of here\". The LAPD makes plans to transfer Montel into federal custody. They initially plan for travel by air, but Gamble shoots down the helicopter with a high-powered rifle. The police next send out a large convoy, which gang members attack and discover to be a decoy, at the same time as Hondo's team is spiriting Montel away in two SUVs. However, while driving Montel into federal custody, it is revealed TJ had been plotting with Gamble, and the two succeed in taking Montel from the other officers, critically wounding Boxer in the process.\n\nHondo and the rest of his team give chase for a final battle against Gamble's group. Fuller later informs them that Gamble intends to fly Montel out of the United States. Fuller dispatches every officer to Hawthorne airport to prevent the escape. As Hondo and his SWAT team race across town, they observe a plane flying at lower than normal altitudes and deduce correctly that the plane is going to land on the [[Sixth Street Viaduct|Sixth Street Bridge]] and is expected by Gamble. They decide to go after the plane, as available units are at the airport and won't make it in time. Before Gamble's group can take off, the team intercepts it, and a gun battle ensues, killing Gamble's remaining thugs, although wounding Sanchez. TJ commits suicide out of remorse for his betrayal of the team and to avoid being disgraced. Street pursues Gamble under the bridge and following a hand-to-hand fight, inadvertently kills him by knocking him under the wheels of a passing train. Fuller and the rest of the LAPD arrive to take care of everything else. Fuller thanks Hondo and his team for their success but tells them the job wasn't finished as Montel was not yet in federal custody. Hondo and his team deliver Montel to a federal prison to await trial. On the way home to Los Angeles, a report of a holdup in progress comes over the police radio and despite the team being two officers down and off shift for the past twelve hours, Hondo, Street, Kaye, and Sanchez decide to help anyway.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Officer III James \"Jim\" Street\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as Officer III Brian Gamble\n* [[Brian Van Holt]] as Officer III Michael Boxer\n* [[Samuel L.

Moritz]]. It is based on the [[S.W.A.T. (1975 TV series)|1975 television series of the same name]] and stars [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Colin Farrell]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Josh Charles]], [[Jeremy Renner]], [[Brian Van Holt]] and [[Olivier Martinez]].\n\nIn the film, Hondo (Jackson) and his SWAT team are tasked to escort an imprisoned drug kingpin/international fugitive to prison after he offers a $100 million dollar reward to anyone who can break him out of police custody.\n\n''S.W.A.T.'' was released in the United States on August 8, 2003 and grossed $207 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nJim Street ([[Colin Farrell]]), a former [[U.S. Navy SEAL]] and hot-shot cop from the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] and his [[SWAT]] team are sent to stop a gang of robbers who have taken over a bank. His high-tempered partner and close friend Brian Gamble ([[Jeremy Renner]]) disobeys an order to hold their position and engages the bank robbers, accidentally wounding a hostage in the process. Gamble and Street are demoted by Captain Fuller ([[Larry Poindexter]]), the commanding officer of the [[LAPD Metropolitan Division]]. Gamble quits the force following an intense argument with Fuller, and Street is taken off the team and sent to work in the \"gun cage\", where he looks after the gear and weaponry. Fuller offers Street the chance to return to SWAT by selling Gamble out, but he refuses, though people refuse to trust him as his decision was never made public.\n\nSix months after the incident, the chief of police calls on Sergeant Daniel \"Hondo\" Harrelson ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]), a [[Force Recon|former Marine Force Recon]] Sergeant  who fought in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], to help re-organize the SWAT platoon. Hondo puts together a diverse team, including himself, Street, Christina Sanchez ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]), Deacon Kaye ([[LL Cool J]]), TJ McCabe ([[Josh Charles]]), and Michael Boxer ([[Brian Van Holt]]). The team members train together, eventually forging bonds of friendship. As a result, their first mission to subdue an unstable gunman is a success.\n\nMeanwhile, French [[drug lord]] Alexander \"Alex\" Montel ([[Olivier Martinez]]) arrives in Los Angeles and goes to a local restaurant to kill his uncle for holding back the family money from him. While driving to the airport, uniformed LAPD officers stop Montel for a broken tail light and later detain him to get a full positive I.D. on him; they learn through [[Interpol]] that he is an international fugitive wanted in over a dozen countries. But as Montel is being transferred to prison, his associates, dressed as LAPD officers, attempt to rescue him as he rides the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] bus. Hondo's team arrives in time to kill the two gunmen and recapture Montel. As Montel, under SWAT escort, approaches the police station, reporters crowd around them, prompting Montel to yell to the cameras that he would \"give 100 million dollars to whoever gets [him] out of here\". The LAPD makes plans to transfer Montel into federal custody. They initially plan for travel by air, but Gamble shoots down the helicopter with a high-powered rifle. The police next send out a large convoy, which gang members attack and discover to be a decoy, at the same time as Hondo's team is spiriting Montel away in two SUVs. However, while driving Montel into federal custody, it is revealed TJ had been plotting with Gamble, and the two succeed in taking Montel from the other officers, critically wounding Boxer in the process.\n\nHondo and the rest of his team give chase for a final battle against Gamble's group. Fuller later informs them that Gamble intends to fly Montel out of the United States. Fuller dispatches every officer to Hawthorne airport to prevent the escape. As Hondo and his SWAT team race across town, they observe a plane flying at lower than normal altitudes and deduce correctly that the plane is going to land on the [[Sixth Street Viaduct|Sixth Street Bridge]] and is expected by Gamble. They decide to go after the plane, as available units are at the airport and won't make it in time. Before Gamble's group can take off, the team intercepts it, and a gun battle ensues, killing Gamble's remaining thugs, although wounding Sanchez. TJ commits suicide out of remorse for his betrayal of the team and to avoid being disgraced. Street pursues Gamble under the bridge and following a hand-to-hand fight, inadvertently kills him by knocking him under the wheels of a passing train. Fuller and the rest of the LAPD arrive to take care of everything else. Fuller thanks Hondo and his team for their success but tells them the job wasn't finished as Montel was not yet in federal custody. Hondo and his team deliver Montel to a federal prison to await trial. On the way home to Los Angeles, a report of a holdup in progress comes over the police radio and despite the team being two officers down and off shift for the past twelve hours, Hondo, Street, Kaye, and Sanchez decide to help anyway.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Officer III James \"Jim\" Street\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as Officer III Brian Gamble\n* [[Brian Van Holt]] as Officer III Michael Boxer\n* [[Samuel L.

[[Paul Walker]] was originally cast and had even started training for the part, but had to drop out due to filming on ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]''. [[Colin Farrell]] eventually replaced him. [[Vin Diesel]] was offered to portray Deacon \"Deke\" Kaye, but passed because he was in production with ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick]]'' and [[LL Cool J]] was then cast. At one point during the early stages of development, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was considered for the role of Dan \"Hondo\" Harrelson, but he declined and [[Samuel L.

It connects [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#North|North Portland]], [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Portland State University]] (PSU). The line runs north\u2013south from the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland Expo Center]] to the [[Rose Quarter]] along a {{convert|5.8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment, referred to as the '''Interstate MAX''', and northbound through downtown Portland along the [[Portland Transit Mall]] on 6th Avenue. It serves 17 stops between the {{stn|Expo Center}} and [[PSU South stations|PSU South/Southwest 6th and College]] stations; of these, seven stops occupy the median of [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], giving that segment its name. The Yellow Line runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum [[headway]] of 15 minutes during most of the day.\n\nFollowing years of failed attempts to construct the [[MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal|South\u2013North Line]] between [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]], Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension to North Portland in 1999. The line, which began construction in 2001, opened on May 1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule.

It connects [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#North|North Portland]], [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Portland State University]] (PSU). The line runs north\u2013south from the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland Expo Center]] to the [[Rose Quarter]] along a {{convert|5.8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment, referred to as the '''Interstate MAX''', and northbound through downtown Portland along the [[Portland Transit Mall]] on 6th Avenue. It serves 17 stops between the {{stn|Expo Center}} and [[PSU South stations|PSU South/Southwest 6th and College]] stations; of these, seven stops occupy the median of [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], giving that segment its name. The Yellow Line runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum [[headway]] of 15 minutes during most of the day.\n\nFollowing years of failed attempts to construct the [[MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal|South\u2013North Line]] between [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]], Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension to North Portland in 1999. The line, which began construction in 2001, opened on May 1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule. From 2004 to 2009, the Yellow Line ran between Expo Center station in North Portland and the [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|Library and Galleria stations]] in downtown Portland, sharing tracks within downtown with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]]. In 2009, TriMet rerouted it to the newly rebuilt Portland Transit Mall.\n\nSince 2015, the Yellow Line has operated as a northbound [[through train|through service]] of the [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]] from PSU South/Southwest 6th and College station, sharing its transit mall alignment with the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]. Conversely, most southbound Yellow Line trains, which had served the other half of the mall on 5th Avenue from 2009 to 2015, through operate into the Orange Line from [[Union Station/Northwest 6th & Hoyt and Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan stations|Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan Street station]] and terminate at [[Southeast Park Avenue station]] in [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]. {{As of|September 2018}}, the Yellow Line is the fourth-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 13,170 weekday riders daily.\n\n==History==\n===Early proposals===\n{{See also|MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal}}\n[[File:FREEWAY (ROUTE I-5) RUNS DIRECTLY THROUGH THIS ESTABLISHED RESIDENTIAL AREA OF NORTHEAST PORTLAND - NARA - 548092.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=refer to caption|An aerial view of Interstate 5 (near center) and Interstate Avenue (upper right) facing south, shown in 1973]]\n\nPortland city planners originally conceived the idea of a northside passenger rail service in 1988 as part of Portland's Central City and [[Albina District, Portland, Oregon|Albina]] Community plans.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oliver |first=Gordon |title=Economic planning outlined |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=July 12, 1988 |page=B6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pickett |first=Nelson |title=Planning commission looks at Albina Community Plan |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=February 25, 1992 |page=B2}}</ref> These plans sought to extend light rail through North Portland across the [[Columbia River]] and into [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] via a potential route on either [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], [[Interstate 5 (Oregon)|Interstate 5]] (I-5), or [[Oregon Route 99E|Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard]] (formerly Northeast Union Avenue).<ref>{{cite news |last=Mayer |first=James |title=Planners seek economic niche for inner city; Bureau plans 3-years study of North, Northeast Portland, hoping to help revive area |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=May 15, 1989 |page=B2}}</ref> As members of the U.S. [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Committee on Appropriations]], Oregon Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] and Washington Senator [[Brock Adams]] combined these proposals with the Portland\u2013[[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] light rail plan, for which the committee appropriated $2&nbsp;million in September 1989.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kohler |first1=Vince |last2=Stewart |first2=Bill |title=Light-rail proposals gain ground in Congress; senate panel approves transportation funding bill, aiding plans for new Oregon City, Vancouver lines |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 10, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref>\n\nPreliminary alignment studies to Washington's [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]], including an additional proposal for a line between [[Vancouver Mall]] and [[Clackamas Town Center]] along [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|I-205]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Bill |title=Clark County light-rail plans chugging along; more than $1&nbsp;million will be spent on studies on both sides of the river |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 24, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref> commenced shortly after.
