With 147 professional victories,<ref>{{cite web |title=Bernard Hinault wins |url=https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/bernard-hinault/statistics/wins |publisher=ProCyclingStats |accessdate=6 November 2019}}</ref> including five in the [[Tour de France]], he is often named among the greatest cyclists of all time.\n\nHinault started cycling as an amateur in his native [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]]. After a successful amateur career, he signed with the [[Gitane\u2013Campagnolo]] team to turn professional in 1975. He took breakthrough victories at both the [[1977 Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]] classic and the [[1977 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9|Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]] stage race in 1977. In 1978, he won his first two [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]]: the [[1978 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] and the [[1978 Tour de France|Tour de France]]. In the following years, he was the most successful professional cyclist, adding another Tour victory in [[1979 Tour de France|1979]] and a win at the [[1980 Giro d'Italia]]. Although a knee injury forced him to quit the [[1980 Tour de France]] while in the lead, he returned to win the [[1980 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|World Championship road race]] later in the year. He added another Tour victory in [[1981 Tour de France|1981]], before completing his first Giro-Tour double in 1982.\n\nAfter winning the [[1983 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]], a return of his knee problems forced him to miss that year's [[1983 Tour de France|Tour de France]], won by his teammate [[Laurent Fignon]]. Tensions within the [[Renault (cycling team)|Renault team]] led to his leaving and joining [[La Vie Claire]]. With his new team, he raced the [[1984 Tour de France]], being comprehensively beaten by Fignon. He recovered the following year, winning another Giro-Tour double with the help of teammate [[Greg LeMond]]. In the [[1986 Tour de France]], he engaged in an intra-team rivalry with LeMond, who won his first of three Tours. Hinault retired shortly thereafter. {{As of|2019}} he was the most recent French winner of the Tour de France. After his cycling career, Hinault turned to farming, while fulfilling representative duties for the organisers of the Tour de France until 2016.\n\nAll through his career, Hinault was known by the nickname ''le blaireau'' (\"the badger\"); he associated himself with the animal due to its aggressive nature, a trait he embodied on the bike. Within the [[peloton]] (the field of riders), Hinault assumed the role of ''patron'', exercising authority over races he took part in.\n\n==Early life and family==\nHinault was born on 14 November 1954 in the [[Brittany (administrative region)|Breton]] village of [[Yffiniac]], the second oldest of four children to Joseph and Lucie Hinault. The family lived in a cottage named La Cl\u00f4ture, built shortly after Hinault was born. His parents were farmers, and the children often had to help out at harvest time.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=21\u201324}} His father later worked as a [[platelayer]] for the national rail company [[SNCF]].{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=6}} Hinault was described as a \"hyperactive\" child, with his mother nicknaming him \"little [[hooligan]]\".{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=21\u201324}} Hinault was not a good student, but visited the technical college in [[Saint-Brieuc]] for an engineering apprenticeship. He started athletics there, becoming a runner and finishing tenth in the French junior cross-country championship in 1971.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=26\u201327}}\n\nIn December 1974, just before turning professional, Hinault married Martine, who he had met at a family wedding the year before.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=61\u201362}} Their first son, Mickael, was born in 1975,{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=68}} with a second, Alexandre, in 1981.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=150}} Hinault and his family lived in [[Quessoy]], close to Yffiniac, while he was a professional cyclist. After his retirement, they moved to a farm {{convert|64|km|mi|abbr=on}} away in Brittany.<ref name=tourdeforce>{{cite news |last1=Abt |first1=Samuel |authorlink=Samuel Abt | title=Biking's Tour de Force |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/magazine/biking-s-tour-de-force.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=8 January 2019 |date=26 June 1983}}</ref> Hinault had bought the {{convert|48|ha|abbr=on}} property near [[Calorguen]] in 1983.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=304}} Martine later served as mayor of Calorguen.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=306}}\n\n==Amateur career==\n{{quote box|quote=\"It seemed natural to him that he had won.\"<br /> Hinault's mother Lucie speaking about his reaction after his first race.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=32}}|width=20%|align=left}}\nHinault came to cycling through his cousin Ren\u00e9, who rode weekend races. At first he had to use the shared family bike, which he rode devotedly. He received his own bike when he was 15 as a reward for passing his school examinations, and used it to travel to college. During the summer of 1971 he made training rides with Ren\u00e9, who had problems keeping up with the sixteen-year old Bernard, even though he was an experienced amateur rider. Hinault received his racing licence from Club Olympique Briochin in late April{{nbsp}}1971 and entered his first race on 2{{nbsp}}May in [[Planguenoual]]. Advised only to try to stay with the other riders, Hinault won the event.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=28\u201331}} Hinault won his first five races, amassing twelve wins from twenty races by the end of the year.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=32}} Also during the summer of 1971, Hinault was at odds with his father about his choice to pursue cycling as a career. Joseph Hinault relented only after his son ran away from home for three days to stay with his cousins, sleeping on straw in the barn.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=34}}\n\nFor 1972, Hinault was allowed to race with the over-18s. At a race in [[Hillion]], he and Ren\u00e9 escaped from the field and reached the finish alone. They crossed the line together to share the victory, to the dismay of the race organisers.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=37\u201338}} The young Hinault was heavily influenced by his trainer at the Club Olympique Briochin, Robert Le Roux, who had earlier worked with [[1965 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|1965 World Champion]] [[Tom Simpson]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=45}} Hinault won nineteen races in his second season as an amateur, including the national junior championship against opposition a year older than him, such as future professional [[Bernard Vallet]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=11}} He was conscripted into the military at age 18, and did not race throughout 1973. He was unable to join the army's training centre for young athletes and instead served in [[Sissonne]] with the [[21st Marine Infantry Regiment]].{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=11}} Returning to competition overweight, Hinault managed to win his first race of 1974. This was his last season as an amateur and again was highly successful, including a victory in his home town of Yffiniac towards the end of the year, where an alliance formed by four other riders was unable to hold him back. He also competed in [[track cycling]], winning the national [[Individual pursuit|pursuit]] championship.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=52\u201354}} On the road, he took part in the [[\u00c9toile des Espoirs]], a race open to amateurs and young professionals. Hinault finished fifth overall, and second on the time trial stage behind [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships \u2013 Men's individual pursuit|reigning pursuit world champion]] [[Roy Schuiten]]. Towards the end of the season, Hinault turned down an offer to race with the prestigious [[Athletic Club de Boulogne-Billancourt]], instead deciding to turn professional in 1975.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=55\u201356}}\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n=== 1975\u20131977: Gitane ===\nIn January 1975, Hinault turned professional with the [[Gitane\u2013Campagnolo]] team, run by [[UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|former World Champion]] [[Jean Stablinski]], on a lean wage of 2,500{{nbsp}}[[French franc|francs]] per month. The decision to turn professional relatively early was in part taken as, had Hinault raced the 1975 season as an amateur, he would have likely been prevented by the French cycling federation from turning professional before the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] to be part of the [[France at the 1976 Summer Olympics|French team there]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=60\u201361}} Early on, he showed no interest in adhering to the unwritten rules of the peloton, whereby younger riders were expected to show respect towards older ones. At a [[Criterium|criterium race]] in August{{nbsp}}1975 he went up against a coalition of senior riders, who had decided to divide the prize money between them. Hinault won all the intermediate cash prizes until five-time [[Tour de France]] winner [[Eddy Merckx]] declared that Hinault was included in the pact.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=58\u201360}} His results in his first season were impressive, with a seventh place [[1975 Paris\u2013Nice|at Paris\u2013Nice]] and a victory at the [[Circuit de la Sarthe (cycling)|Circuit de la Sarthe]], earning him the Promotion Pernod, the prize for the best new professional in France.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=63\u201364}} However, Hinault showed little willingness to learn the basic trades of cycling from Stablinski, often escaping early in the race instead of learning how to ride inside the peloton. Together with Stablinski entering Hinault into too many races, this led to conflicts between them.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=66\u201368}}\n\nFor 1976, Hinault stayed with Gitane, as former professional [[Cyrille Guimard]], who had just retired from cycling, took over the team and became ''[[directeur sportif]]''. Guimard and Hinault got along well, and the latter was kept out of the high-profile races for 1976, instead focussing on a steady improvement in lesser known races such as [[Paris\u2013Camembert]], which he won. That year, Guimard spurred [[Lucien Van Impe]] to his only win in the Tour de France.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=69\u201375}} Hinault's progress was visible, with a second consecutive victory at the Circuit de la Sarthe, a third place at the [[Grand Prix du Midi Libre]] and a win at the Tour de l'Aude, ensuring him the Prestige Pernod, the award for the best French rider of the season.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=76}} In total, Hinault won 15 races in 1976. At the end of the year, he came sixth at the [[1976 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|World Championship Road Race]], being beaten to the line for fifth by Eddy Merckx.{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=18}}\n\nDuring the [[Classic cycle races|spring classics]] season of 1977, Hinault left the [[1977 Tour of Flanders|Tour of Flanders]] before it had even started, not wanting to risk his health in a rain- and cold-affected race on cobbled roads. This drew him a formal warning by Guimard for his conduct. Three weeks later, Hinault won [[1977 Gent\u2013Wevelgem|Gent\u2013Wevelgem]] in a solo effort after an attack {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish.{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=22}} Five days later, at [[1977 Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]], Hinault followed an attack by favourite [[Andr\u00e9 Dierickx]], and beat him in the two-man sprint to take his first victory in one of cycling's \"[[Cycling monument|monuments]]\".{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=78\u201379}} In accordance with Guimard's plan to build Hinault up slowly, he did not enter the [[1977 Tour de France|Tour de France]]. He did however start the [[1977 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9|Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]], seen as the most important preparation event for the Tour. While in the leader's jersey on the penultimate stage to [[Grenoble]], Hinault attacked up the [[Col de Porte]], leading Van Impe and [[Bernard Th\u00e9venet]] by 1:30 minutes when crossing the summit. On the descent, he misjudged a [[hairpin turn|hairpin corner]] and crashed down the mountainside. A tree saved him from falling far down, while his bike was lost. Hinault then climbed back onto the road, took a new bike and without showing any hesitation, continued on. Up the finishing climb in Grenoble, he briefly dismounted, still shocked from the near-death experience and pushed his bike for about {{convert|20|m|yd|abbr=on}}, before remounting and winning the stage eighty seconds ahead of Van Impe. This also secured him the overall victory ahead of eventual Tour winner Th\u00e9venet.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=80\u201381}} \n\nThis incident was mentioned from a semi-pro rider's perspective in the [[Tim Krabb\u00e9]] book De Runner (The Rider) when the main character is about to descend a Col in the [[Mont Aigoual|Tour de Mont Aigoual]]: {{quote|Curves. I'm afraid, and for good reason. Only three weeks ago, during the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9, the young up-and-coming Hinault flew out of a curve, into a ravine. Gone. At that moment the French TV audience had every reason to assume that he was lying down there with a broken back. Then he climbed up, was given another bike, rode on, won the stage and went on to win the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9. A star for ever. Hinault had gone into that ravine a rider, but came out a vedette, and the entire operation lasted no longer than fifteen seconds.\"<ref>{{cite book| title= The Rider|first1=Tim |last1=Krabb\u00e9 |page= 47|isbn=9781582342900|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London}}</ref>}}\n\nAt the end of the season, Hinault won the [[Grand Prix des Nations]], an [[individual time trial]], with a substantial margin of 3:15 minutes ahead of favourite [[Joop Zoetemelk]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=91}}\n\n=== 1978\u20131983: Renault ===\n====1978: Grand Tour breakthrough====\n[[File:Bernard Hinault 1978 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hinault at the [[1978 Tour de France]]|alt=Black-and-white photo of Hinault in a cycling jersey, smiling and lifting his right arm in the air]]\nAt the beginning of 1978, the Gitane team was taken over by its parent company, the state-owned car manufacturer [[Renault]], becoming {{ct|REN|1978}}.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=105}} Hinault started the season with second place at [[1978 Paris\u2013Nice|Paris\u2013Nice]].

He ensured his overall victory by winning stage 18 to [[Amurrio]]. On that stage, he bridged over to escapee [[Andr\u00e9s Gandarias]], who had earlier asked for Hinault's permission to attack. Hinault claimed to have been annoyed into attacking by one of Gandarias's teammates and offered to carry him to the finish. However, the Spaniard was unable to follow his wheel, saying: \"This guy has made me suffer like a dog, he's tougher than Eddy Merckx!\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=93\u201395}} In all, Hinault won five stages of the Vuelta. A sixth win was prevented on the final day of the Grand Tour, on which a short time trial was raced in the afternoon, held at [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. The stage was marred by protests and obstructions by supporters of the Basque separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]. Hinault himself had sand thrown into his eyes, but won the stage nonetheless, only to find that the results would not count due to the surrounding circumstances.{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|pages=35\u201341}}\n\nAhead of his first Tour de France, Hinault raced in the [[1978 Tour de Suisse|Tour de Suisse]], where he did not feature prominently.

He launched an escape, on which he rode {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}} solo, leading the rest of his competitors by more than six minutes by the start of the last lap. However, he had forgotten to eat enough and suffered from [[hypoglycemia]] during the last part of the race, crossing the finish line to take the title severely weakened.

The riders had been complaining about split stages, where more than one would be held on one day, as was the case on 12{{nbsp}}July. When they reached the finishing town, they dismounted their bikes and walked to the finish line in protest. Hinault was chosen by his fellow competitors to be the spokesperson of the strike. Journalist Felix Magowan wrote: \"Before today's strike, people were asking if the Tour had a boss. Today that was answered. His name is Hinault.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=85\u201391}} Following the strike, Hinault had trouble sleeping and was caught out the next day, a stage in the [[Massif Central]], forcing his team into a long chase. Thus weakened and slowed by spectator interference at a bike change, he lost 1:40 minutes to Zoetemelk on the following day's uphill time trial.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=115}} Hinault countered the next day ''en route'' to [[Saint-\u00c9tienne]] during stage 15, breaking away with [[Hennie Kuiper]]. By the finish, the two had been reeled back, but Hinault contested the finishing sprint, winning the stage. The following day, stage 16 to [[Alpe d'Huez]], ended with Zoetemelk, Hinault and the temporary leader of the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]] and thus yellow jersey wearer [[Michel Pollentier]] separated by only 18 seconds. However, Pollentier was disqualified for trying to cheat his [[doping in sport|doping]] test, leaving Hinault and Zoetemelk to fight out the overall victory. On the final mountain stage, Hinault put his rival under pressure, but was unable to make up any time. He then clinched the yellow jersey in the final time trial, gaining more than four minutes to win his first Tour de France with an advantage of 3:56 minutes.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=100\u2013102}} Following his Tour win, he finished fifth at the [[1978 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|World Championships]], before once more winning the Grand Prix des Nations, this time ahead of [[Francesco Moser]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=103}}\n\n====1979: Second Tour victory and Classics success====\nThe 1979 season started slowly for an off-form Hinault.

He won the race by over ten minutes, also taking the [[Points classification|points]] and [[King of the Mountains|mountain classifications]]. In the coming weeks ahead of the Tour, he proved his willingness to assist his teammates to ensure their loyalty, helping [[Lucien Didier]] win the [[Tour de Luxembourg]] and finishing second behind [[Roland Berland]] in the National Championship race.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=117\u2013118}}\n[[File:Joop Zoetemelk, Bestanddeelnr 930-4019.jpg|thumb|[[Joop Zoetemelk]] ''(pictured in 1979)'' was Hinault's strongest competitor during his first [[Tour de France]] victories.|alt=Black-and-white photograph of Zoetemelk, wearing cycling gear]]\nThe [[1979 Tour de France|Tour de France]] was again a two-way battle between Hinault and Zoetemelk. In the prologue, Hinault was fourth, on the same time as the Dutchman. The mountain stages started immediately thereafter, with Hinault winning the mountain time trial on stage 2, taking over the yellow jersey. He also won the next stage into [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. The team time trial on stage{{nbsp}}4 again went Zoetemelk's way, as his Mercier team took back 41 seconds on Hinault's Renault squad. Zoetemelk now was only 12 seconds behind Hinault. On stage 8, in another team time trial, Renault fared much better, and Hinault extended his advantage to 1:18 minutes. The next day however, on a stage containing [[Cobblestone#Use in cycling|cobbled sections]], Hinault suffered two [[Flat tire#Bicycles|punctures]], losing almost four minutes and the race lead to Zoetemelk.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=119}} He took back 36 seconds on the time trial in [[Brussels]] on stage 11 before regaining the race lead after another time trial, uphill to [[Avoriaz]] on stage 15. At this stage, he led Zoetemelk by 1:48 minutes, with third-placed Kuiper already more than 12 minutes behind. Hinault gained another minute on stage 16, before Zoetemelk regained 47 seconds up Alpe d'Huez three days later. The final time trial of the Tour went Hinault's way once again, extending his advantage by a further 69 seconds. He also took the next stage in a slightly uphill sprint finish.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=119\u2013122}} On the final stage towards the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] in [[Paris]], traditionally [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es stage in the Tour de France|a ceremonious affair without attacks]], Zoetemelk and Hinault broke away, with both gapping the field and Hinault taking another stage victory. Zoetemelk finished 3:07 minutes behind Hinault, but then had ten minutes added to his time for failing a doping test. The next finisher, [[Joaquim Agostinho]], was almost half an hour behind the winner.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=114\u2013116}}\n\nTowards the end of the season, Hinault won his second cycling monument, the [[1979 Giro di Lombardia|Giro di Lombardia]]. He had escaped from the field {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish, but was later joined by some other riders. Only [[Silvano Contini]] finished with him, with the next group more than three minutes behind. The victory also secured that Hinault won his first of four consecutive [[Super Prestige Pernod International]] competitions, the award handed to the best rider of the season.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=123\u2013124}}\n\n====1980: Attempt at the Triple Crown====\nAs was often the case, Hinault started the season slowly in 1980, withdrawing from [[1980 Paris\u2013Nice|Paris\u2013Nice]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=129}} He then entered [[1980 Paris\u2013Roubaix|Paris\u2013Roubaix]], partly to prepare for the cobbled sections in the upcoming Tour de France, and finished fourth.{{sfn|Moore|2014|p=25}} A week later, he scored one of his most memorable wins at [[1980 Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]]. As soon as the riders left [[Li\u00e8ge]], snow began to fall, soon turning into a blizzard. Hinault wanted to abandon, as had many others, including all but one of his teammates. He was convinced to carry on until the feeding station at [[Bastogne]], where the snow had turned into rain. Only 21 riders were left by this point. Hinault removed his rain cape and attacked, catching up to the leaders and carried on by himself, winning with a margin of almost ten minutes ahead of Kuiper. The victory came at a price, as his right index and middle fingers took weeks to recover from [[frostbite]], and caused him pain for several years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge's cold memories |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/liege-bastogne-lieges-cold-memories/ |website=[[Cyclingnews.com]] |accessdate=16 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816165809/http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/liege-bastogne-lieges-cold-memories/ |archivedate=16 August 2018 |date=23 April 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHinault and Guimard then turned their attention to the only Grand Tour he had not won yet: the [[Giro d'Italia]]. They hoped that Hinault would be able to reproduce a feat Eddy Merckx had achieved in 1974, winning the Giro, the Tour and the World Championship in the same year.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=131}} This is commonly referred to as the [[Triple Crown of Cycling]].{{efn|Since Merckx, only [[Stephen Roche]] managed to repeat the Triple Crown, in 1987.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Cossins |first1=Peter |title=Crowning achievement: How Stephen Roche completed his shock Triple Crown |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/crowning-achievement-stephen-roche-completed-shock-triple-crown-352929 |magazine=[[Cycling Weekly]] |accessdate=16 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816170637/https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/crowning-achievement-stephen-roche-completed-shock-triple-crown-352929 |archivedate=16 August 2018 |date=30 September 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n\nHinault started the [[1980 Giro d'Italia|Giro d'Italia]] as odds-on favourite, pitted against local riders Francesco Moser and Giuseppe Saronni, who had the home crowd on their side. Following a fourth place at the prologue in [[Genoa]], Hinault made a spontaneous visit to [[Fausto Coppi]]'s home of [[Castellania, Piedmont|Castellania]], paying respect to the first rider ever to have won Giro and Tour in the same year. On stage 5, a time trial to [[Pisa]], Hinault took over the race leader's [[pink jersey]]. He then relinquished his lead to [[Roberto Visentini]], who was not considered to be a contender for the final victory. On stage 14, he attacked when the peloton relaxed after an intermediate sprint, winning the stage ahead of [[Wladimiro Panizza]], who took the race lead. Hinault then made the decisive move of the race on stage 20, when he attacked on the tough climb of the [[Stelvio Pass]]. He caught up with his teammate Bernaudeau, and both carried on for the remaining {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the stage together. Hinault gifted the stage victory to his teammate, while he clinched the overall victory almost six minutes ahead of Panizza.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=131\u2013134}}\n\nIn the [[1980 Tour de France|Tour de France]], Hinault was once again set to duel with Joop Zoetemelk, who had moved to the dominant {{ct|TIR|1980}} squad. Hinault won the prologue in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, five seconds ahead of [[Gerrie Knetemann]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=134}} On stage{{nbsp}}5 from Li\u00e8ge to [[Lille]], which contained cobbled sections used in [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]], conditions were poor with rain and heavy winds. Hinault called for the field to take a slow tempo, but when Zoetemelk's teammate [[Jan Raas]] attacked, he went after him. He eventually found himself in a group with several other riders, while Zoetemelk was distanced. At {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish, he followed another attack from Kuiper and won the sprint at the line. The next stage was set to contain more cobbled roads, but on Hinault's protest, most of the worst parts were taken out. Hinault had however suffered damage to his left knee on the stage to Lille.{{sfn|Moore|2014|pages=27\u201331}} Hinault finished only fifth on stage 11's individual time trial, won by Zoetemelk.

He then took victory at the [[Four Days of Dunkirk]]. But his spring campaign lacked major successes. At the [[1984 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9|Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]], he came second to [[Mart\u00edn Ram\u00edrez (cyclist)|Mart\u00edn Ram\u00edrez]], who later claimed that Hinault and his team had tried to intimidate him during the final stage of the race.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=230\u2013231}} A memorable episode occurred during the [[1984 Paris\u2013Nice|Paris\u2013Nice]], a race he finished third overall. During stage{{nbsp}}5 to [[La Seyne-sur-Mer]], Hinault was descending in a lead group with several other favourites. As they reached the valley, the road was blocked by protesters, unhappy with the announced closure of a dockyard at [[La Ciotat]]. While the other riders stopped, he drove into the group head-on, dismounted, and punched the protester closest to him. In the ensuing fist fight, Hinault suffered a broken rib.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=199\u2013201}}\n\nThe [[1984 Tour de France|Tour de France]] was made out to be the big duel between Hinault and Fignon, who had just won the French National Championship.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=230\u2013231}}{{sfn|Moore|2014|p=133}} Hinault won the prologue, but Renault took the team time trial, 55 seconds ahead of La Vie Claire. He lost another 49 seconds to Fignon in the first long individual time trial, a discipline he had previously dominated. Following the second time trial, Hinault was only seventh on general classification, two minutes behind his adversary. The next stage led to Alpe d'Huez. Hinault attacked on the [[Rampe de Laffrey]], but Fignon was able to respond. The two exchanged attacks on the way up the climb, but it was in the valley that Hinault was able to draw out a gap of about a minute. On Alpe d'Huez itself, he was first passed by eventual stage winner [[Luis Herrera (cyclist)|Luis Herrera]]. When he started to slow, Fignon caught up to him and eventually dropped Hinault, who lost a further three minutes. He ultimately finished the Tour in second place, a significant ten minutes behind Fignon.{{sfn|Moore|2014|pages=133\u2013140}}\n\nHinaut managed to bounce back from his Tour defeat in the fall. In late September, he took his fifth and final victory at the Grand Prix des Nations, riding the {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} time trial at a then record speed of {{convert|44.19|kph|mph|abbr=on}}. Fignon could only manage fourth, more than two minutes behind. Next, he won the [[Trofeo Baracchi]], a two-man time trial, in which he competed with Moser.

During the race, Hinault was met with hostility from the home crowd, who supported local rider Francesco Moser. On the stage 12 time trial, Hinault took the pink jersey and opened the decisive gap to Moser, who would eventually finish second. During the stage however, Hinault was spat at by spectators and almost knocked over, even though his team car rode behind him with the door opened the entire time to ensure that bystanders would have a harder time impeding him. Hinault won his third Giro with a margin of just over a minute.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=254\u2013255}}\n\nIn the [[1985 Tour de France|Tour de France]], Fignon did not take part due to an Achilles heel injury. Hinault therefore entered the race as the favourite. He took victory in the prologue in his native [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]]. La Vie Claire won the stage{{nbsp}}3 team time trial by over a minute. The next day, Hinault's teammate [[Kim Andersen (cyclist)|Kim Andersen]] took over the yellow jersey. Hinault supported him over the next days, even going so far as dropping back when Andersen punctured to lead him back into the peloton, showing his loyalty to riders who would later have to assist him. On stage 8, a time trial to [[Strasbourg]], Hinault took back the race lead, winning the stage by more than two minutes ahead of [[Stephen Roche]]. While the race travelled through the Alps and in a second time trial, he consolidated his lead, building an advantage of five-and-a-half minutes on LeMond, who was now second overall.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pages=150\u2013160}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"I'll stir things up to help Greg win, and I'll have fun doing it.

On stage 17, he showed signs of weakness and was unable to stay with the other leaders on the [[Col du Tourmalet]]. LeMond meanwhile followed an attack by Roche, but was forbidden by the team to cooperate to distance Hinault. LeMond would later claim that the team had deceived him by telling him that Hinault was closer behind than he actually was. Hinault eventually finished the stage just over a minute behind LeMond. The time LeMond waited may have been enough so that the two teammates would have contested the [[Maillot Jaune]] in the penultimate time trial. In the penultimate day's time trial, LeMond won the stage, but only five seconds ahead of Hinault, not enough to surpass him. This secured Hinault a record-equalling fifth Tour victory, by just under two minutes over his younger teammate.

Hinault was now in the lead of the general classification, 5:25 minutes ahead of LeMond.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pages=209\u2013211}} Even though his lead was significant, he attacked again the following day, on the descent of the Col du Tourmalet, the first climb of the day. By the top of the next climb, the [[Col d'Aspin]], he led the rest of the field by two minutes. However, joint effort behind brought him back before the final ascent up to the ski station of [[Superbagn\u00e8res]]. Hinault then cracked, coming in ninth, 4:39 minutes behind stage winner LeMond.

Hinault attacked repeatedly, but reached the bottom of Alpe d'Huez with LeMond. He led the way up the climb, lined by approximately 300,000 spectators and crossed the finish line hand in hand with LeMond, in an apparent display of comradery. [[Urs Zimmermann]], who had been second overall at the start of the day, lost more than five minutes.<ref name=alpedhuez/> Any signs of appeasement between the rivalling teammates was shattered by Hinault in a television interview shortly after the stage finish, when he declared that the race was not yet over, even though he trailed LeMond by 2:45 minutes.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pages=255\u2013258}}\n\nStage 20 saw the final time trial and the last chance for Hinault to overcome LeMond's advantage.

Laurent Fignon described the first training camps of the year as follows: \"He looked as if he had been inflated. If you didn't know the Badger you would wonder how long it would take for him to get back to what he had been. You would be making a huge mistake.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=169}} Hinault was capable of suffering through the training camp and returning to winning form within a month.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=168\u2013170}} Unlike a rider like Eddy Merckx, Hinault would not aim to win every race he entered. Millar described his approach as such: \"Hinault either cared or he didn't. When he didn't care about winning he'd bumble round and hurt you now and again just to remind you he was there.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=17\u201318}}\n\nWith a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of victories that includes all three Grand Tours (all of them more than once), the World Road Championships and a number of classics, Hinault has often been cited among the greatest cyclists of all time.<ref name=\"cn_greatest\"/><ref name=\"greatest\">{{cite magazine |title=Who is the greatest Grand Tour rider ever? |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/who-is-the-greatest-grand-tour-rider-ever-175929 |magazine=[[Cycling Weekly]] |accessdate=14 November 2018 |date=14 October 2014}}</ref> The ''Historical Dictionary of Cycling'' describes him as \"one of the best riders ever\".<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Heijmans |editor1-first=Jeroen |editor2-last=Mallon |editor2-first=Bill |title=Historical Dictionary of Cycling |date=2011 |publisher=The Scarecrow Press |location=Plymouth |isbn=978-0-8108-7175-5 |pages=102\u2013103}}</ref> Comparisons are often drawn with Eddy Merckx, against whom Hinault rode at the beginning of his career. Lucien Van Impe commented: \"Merckx was the greatest, but Bernard [Hinault] was the most impressive.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=17}} A study conducted in 2006, ranking Tour de France riders from 1953 to 2004 by different performance indicators, put Hinault as the top Tour rider of that period, ahead of Merckx and [[Lance Armstrong]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cherchye |first1=Laurens |last2=Vermeulen |first2=Frederic |title=Robust Rankings of Multidimensional Performances |journal=[[Journal of Sports Economics]] |date=2006 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=359\u2013373 |doi=10.1177/2F1527002505275092|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1527002505275092?ck=nck|access-date=24 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Nickname ===\nHinault was nicknamed ''le [[wikt:blaireau#French|blaireau]]'' in French, a term that can be translated into English as either \"the shaving brush\" or \"the badger\". According to Fotheringham, the nickname originates from Hinault's early training partners, [[Maurice Le Guilloux]] and [[Georges Talbourdet]], who would use the term to tease the young rider. Le Guilloux used it once in front of Pierre Chany, a writer for ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'', and the name stuck.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=154\u2013155}}{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=21}} According to Hinault himself, the term in the first place was supposed to mean no more than \"mate\" or \"buddy\".{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=14}} However, Hinault later embraced the association with the wild animal. In 2003, he commented: \"A badger is a beautiful thing. When it's hunted it goes into its sett and waits. When it comes out again, it attacks. That's the reason for my nickname. When I'm annoyed I go home, you don't see me for a month. When I come out again, I win.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=156}} Hinault, as early as 1983, owned a stuffed badger to demonstrate his association with the animal.<ref name=tourdeforce/>\n\n=== Stance on doping ===\nHinault never tested positive for [[performance-enhancing drugs]] during his professional career and was never implicated in any doping practices.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dopingf\u00e4lle bei der Frankreich-Rundfahrt \u2013 Die Tour-T\u00e4ter |trans-title=Doping cases at the Tour de France - The Tour perpetrators|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/dopingfaelle-bei-der-tour-de-france-die-tour-taeter-1.117049-13 |newspaper=[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]] |accessdate=10 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110224345/https://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/dopingfaelle-bei-der-tour-de-france-die-tour-taeter-1.117049-13 |archivedate=10 January 2019 |language=German |date=6 February 2012}}</ref> He did, however, lead a riders' protest during a criterium race in [[Callac]] in 1982 against the sudden introduction of doping controls. He was handed a one-month suspended ban and fined [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 1,110, though the penalty was never enforced.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=205}}\n\nHinault has been outspoken about several prominent doping cases in the past years. In 2013, he heavily criticised [[Senate (France)|French senators]] for revealing the results of tests conducted in 2004 on samples from the [[1998 Tour de France]]. He called the initiative \"bullshit\" and urged lawmakers \"to stop bringing out the dead\", claiming they \"want to kill the Tour\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Hinault fears for Tour de France in light of doping drama |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/hinault-fears-for-tour-de-france-in-light-of-doping-drama/ |website=[[Cyclingnews.com]] |accessdate=11 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111105143/http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/hinault-fears-for-tour-de-france-in-light-of-doping-drama/ |archivedate=11 January 2019 |date=27 June 2013}}</ref> In the same year, he reacted to comments made by Lance Armstrong, a rider stripped of seven Tour victories due to doping offences. Armstrong suggested that it would be impossible to win the Tour de France without performance-enhancing substances. To counter this claim, Hinault replied: \"He must not know what it was like to ride without doping.\" Armstrong later clarified that he had spoken about the time when he was riding (1999\u20132005).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pretot |first1=Julien |title=Winning without doping was impossible: Armstrong |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cycling-doping-armstrong-idUSBRE95R0QZ20130628 |accessdate=11 January 2019 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=28 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111110438/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cycling-doping-armstrong-idUSBRE95R0QZ20130628 |archivedate=11 January 2019 |location=Porto Vecchio}}</ref> In early 2018, Hinault also spoke out about the adverse analytical result for [[salbutamol]] of four-time Tour winner [[Chris Froome]] at the [[2017 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]]. He criticised Froome for taking part in the [[2018 Giro d'Italia]] while the investigation was still ongoing. In addition, he commented that Froome could not be \"listed among the cycling greats\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kelner |first1=Martha |title=Chris Froome should not be listed with cycling greats, says Hinault |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/29/chris-froome-cycling-bernard-hinault-giro-ditalia |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=11 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111110911/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/29/chris-froome-cycling-bernard-hinault-giro-ditalia |archivedate=11 January 2019 |date=30 May 2018}}</ref> Froome would win the Giro and become the first rider since Hinault to hold all three [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tour]] Jerseys at once.

With 147 professional victories,<ref>{{cite web |title=Bernard Hinault wins |url=https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/bernard-hinault/statistics/wins |publisher=ProCyclingStats |accessdate=6 November 2019}}</ref> including five in the [[Tour de France]], he is often named among the greatest cyclists of all time.\n\nHinault started cycling as an amateur in his native [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]]. After a successful amateur career, he signed with the [[Gitane\u2013Campagnolo]] team to turn professional in 1975. He took breakthrough victories at both the [[1977 Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]] classic and the [[1977 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9|Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]] stage race in 1977. In 1978, he won his first two [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]]: the [[1978 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] and the [[1978 Tour de France|Tour de France]]. In the following years, he was the most successful professional cyclist, adding another Tour victory in [[1979 Tour de France|1979]] and a win at the [[1980 Giro d'Italia]]. Although a knee injury forced him to quit the [[1980 Tour de France]] while in the lead, he returned to win the [[1980 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|World Championship road race]] later in the year. He added another Tour victory in [[1981 Tour de France|1981]], before completing his first Giro-Tour double in 1982.\n\nAfter winning the [[1983 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]], a return of his knee problems forced him to miss that year's [[1983 Tour de France|Tour de France]], won by his teammate [[Laurent Fignon]]. Tensions within the [[Renault (cycling team)|Renault team]] led to his leaving and joining [[La Vie Claire]]. With his new team, he raced the [[1984 Tour de France]], being comprehensively beaten by Fignon. He recovered the following year, winning another Giro-Tour double with the help of teammate [[Greg LeMond]]. In the [[1986 Tour de France]], he engaged in an intra-team rivalry with LeMond, who won his first of three Tours. Hinault retired shortly thereafter. {{As of|2019}} he was the most recent French winner of the Tour de France. After his cycling career, Hinault turned to farming, while fulfilling representative duties for the organisers of the Tour de France until 2016.\n\nAll through his career, Hinault was known by the nickname ''le blaireau'' (\"the badger\"); he associated himself with the animal due to its aggressive nature, a trait he embodied on the bike. Within the [[peloton]] (the field of riders), Hinault assumed the role of ''patron'', exercising authority over races he took part in.\n\n==Early life and family==\nHinault was born on 14 November 1954 in the [[Brittany (administrative region)|Breton]] village of [[Yffiniac]], the second oldest of four children to Joseph and Lucie Hinault. The family lived in a cottage named La Cl\u00f4ture, built shortly after Hinault was born. His parents were farmers, and the children often had to help out at harvest time.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=21\u201324}} His father later worked as a [[platelayer]] for the national rail company [[SNCF]].{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=6}} Hinault was described as a \"hyperactive\" child, with his mother nicknaming him \"little [[hooligan]]\".{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=21\u201324}} Hinault was not a good student, but visited the technical college in [[Saint-Brieuc]] for an engineering apprenticeship. He started athletics there, becoming a runner and finishing tenth in the French junior cross-country championship in 1971.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=26\u201327}}\n\nIn December 1974, just before turning professional, Hinault married Martine, who he had met at a family wedding the year before.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=61\u201362}} Their first son, Mickael, was born in 1975,{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=68}} with a second, Alexandre, in 1981.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=150}} Hinault and his family lived in [[Quessoy]], close to Yffiniac, while he was a professional cyclist. After his retirement, they moved to a farm {{convert|64|km|mi|abbr=on}} away in Brittany.<ref name=tourdeforce>{{cite news |last1=Abt |first1=Samuel |authorlink=Samuel Abt | title=Biking's Tour de Force |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/magazine/biking-s-tour-de-force.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=8 January 2019 |date=26 June 1983}}</ref> Hinault had bought the {{convert|48|ha|abbr=on}} property near [[Calorguen]] in 1983.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=304}} Martine later served as mayor of Calorguen.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=306}}\n\n==Amateur career==\n{{quote box|quote=\"It seemed natural to him that he had won.\"<br /> Hinault's mother Lucie speaking about his reaction after his first race.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=32}}|width=20%|align=left}}\nHinault came to cycling through his cousin Ren\u00e9, who rode weekend races. At first he had to use the shared family bike, which he rode devotedly. He received his own bike when he was 15 as a reward for passing his school examinations, and used it to travel to college. During the summer of 1971 he made training rides with Ren\u00e9, who had problems keeping up with the sixteen-year old Bernard, even though he was an experienced amateur rider. Hinault received his racing licence from Club Olympique Briochin in late April{{nbsp}}1971 and entered his first race on 2{{nbsp}}May in [[Planguenoual]]. Advised only to try to stay with the other riders, Hinault won the event.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=28\u201331}} Hinault won his first five races, amassing twelve wins from twenty races by the end of the year.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=32}} Also during the summer of 1971, Hinault was at odds with his father about his choice to pursue cycling as a career. Joseph Hinault relented only after his son ran away from home for three days to stay with his cousins, sleeping on straw in the barn.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=34}}\n\nFor 1972, Hinault was allowed to race with the over-18s. At a race in [[Hillion]], he and Ren\u00e9 escaped from the field and reached the finish alone. They crossed the line together to share the victory, to the dismay of the race organisers.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=37\u201338}} The young Hinault was heavily influenced by his trainer at the Club Olympique Briochin, Robert Le Roux, who had earlier worked with [[1965 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|1965 World Champion]] [[Tom Simpson]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=45}} Hinault won nineteen races in his second season as an amateur, including the national junior championship against opposition a year older than him, such as future professional [[Bernard Vallet]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=11}} He was conscripted into the military at age 18, and did not race throughout 1973. He was unable to join the army's training centre for young athletes and instead served in [[Sissonne]] with the [[21st Marine Infantry Regiment]].{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=11}} Returning to competition overweight, Hinault managed to win his first race of 1974. This was his last season as an amateur and again was highly successful, including a victory in his home town of Yffiniac towards the end of the year, where an alliance formed by four other riders was unable to hold him back. He also competed in [[track cycling]], winning the national [[Individual pursuit|pursuit]] championship.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=52\u201354}} On the road, he took part in the [[\u00c9toile des Espoirs]], a race open to amateurs and young professionals. Hinault finished fifth overall, and second on the time trial stage behind [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships \u2013 Men's individual pursuit|reigning pursuit world champion]] [[Roy Schuiten]]. Towards the end of the season, Hinault turned down an offer to race with the prestigious [[Athletic Club de Boulogne-Billancourt]], instead deciding to turn professional in 1975.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=55\u201356}}\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n=== 1975\u20131977: Gitane ===\nIn January 1975, Hinault turned professional with the [[Gitane\u2013Campagnolo]] team, run by [[UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|former World Champion]] [[Jean Stablinski]], on a lean wage of 2,500{{nbsp}}[[French franc|francs]] per month. The decision to turn professional relatively early was in part taken as, had Hinault raced the 1975 season as an amateur, he would have likely been prevented by the French cycling federation from turning professional before the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] to be part of the [[France at the 1976 Summer Olympics|French team there]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=60\u201361}} Early on, he showed no interest in adhering to the unwritten rules of the peloton, whereby younger riders were expected to show respect towards older ones. At a [[Criterium|criterium race]] in August{{nbsp}}1975 he went up against a coalition of senior riders, who had decided to divide the prize money between them. Hinault won all the intermediate cash prizes until five-time [[Tour de France]] winner [[Eddy Merckx]] declared that Hinault was included in the pact.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=58\u201360}} His results in his first season were impressive, with a seventh place [[1975 Paris\u2013Nice|at Paris\u2013Nice]] and a victory at the [[Circuit de la Sarthe (cycling)|Circuit de la Sarthe]], earning him the Promotion Pernod, the prize for the best new professional in France.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=63\u201364}} However, Hinault showed little willingness to learn the basic trades of cycling from Stablinski, often escaping early in the race instead of learning how to ride inside the peloton. Together with Stablinski entering Hinault into too many races, this led to conflicts between them.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=66\u201368}}\n\nFor 1976, Hinault stayed with Gitane, as former professional [[Cyrille Guimard]], who had just retired from cycling, took over the team and became ''[[directeur sportif]]''. Guimard and Hinault got along well, and the latter was kept out of the high-profile races for 1976, instead focussing on a steady improvement in lesser known races such as [[Paris\u2013Camembert]], which he won. That year, Guimard spurred [[Lucien Van Impe]] to his only win in the Tour de France.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=69\u201375}} Hinault's progress was visible, with a second consecutive victory at the Circuit de la Sarthe, a third place at the [[Grand Prix du Midi Libre]] and a win at the Tour de l'Aude, ensuring him the Prestige Pernod, the award for the best French rider of the season.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=76}} In total, Hinault won 15 races in 1976. At the end of the year, he came sixth at the [[1976 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|World Championship Road Race]], being beaten to the line for fifth by Eddy Merckx.{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=18}}\n\nDuring the [[Classic cycle races|spring classics]] season of 1977, Hinault left the [[1977 Tour of Flanders|Tour of Flanders]] before it had even started, not wanting to risk his health in a rain- and cold-affected race on cobbled roads. This drew him a formal warning by Guimard for his conduct.

While in the leader's jersey on the penultimate stage to [[Grenoble]], Hinault attacked up the [[Col de Porte]], leading Van Impe and [[Bernard Th\u00e9venet]] by 1:30 minutes when crossing the summit. On the descent, he misjudged a [[hairpin turn|hairpin corner]] and crashed down the mountainside. A tree saved him from falling far down, while his bike was lost.

Up the finishing climb in Grenoble, he briefly dismounted, still shocked from the near-death experience and pushed his bike for about {{convert|20|m|yd|abbr=on}}, before remounting and winning the stage eighty seconds ahead of Van Impe.

At that moment the French TV audience had every reason to assume that he was lying down there with a broken back.

The riders had been complaining about split stages, where more than one would be held on one day, as was the case on 12{{nbsp}}July. When they reached the finishing town, they dismounted their bikes and walked to the finish line in protest. Hinault was chosen by his fellow competitors to be the spokesperson of the strike.

His name is Hinault.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=85\u201391}} Following the strike, Hinault had trouble sleeping and was caught out the next day, a stage in the [[Massif Central]], forcing his team into a long chase.

The following day, stage 16 to [[Alpe d'Huez]], ended with Zoetemelk, Hinault and the temporary leader of the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]] and thus yellow jersey wearer [[Michel Pollentier]] separated by only 18 seconds. However, Pollentier was disqualified for trying to cheat his [[doping in sport|doping]] test, leaving Hinault and Zoetemelk to fight out the overall victory. On the final mountain stage, Hinault put his rival under pressure, but was unable to make up any time.

In the prologue, Hinault was fourth, on the same time as the Dutchman. The mountain stages started immediately thereafter, with Hinault winning the mountain time trial on stage 2, taking over the yellow jersey. He also won the next stage into [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. The team time trial on stage{{nbsp}}4 again went Zoetemelk's way, as his Mercier team took back 41 seconds on Hinault's Renault squad. Zoetemelk now was only 12 seconds behind Hinault. On stage 8, in another team time trial, Renault fared much better, and Hinault extended his advantage to 1:18 minutes. The next day however, on a stage containing [[Cobblestone#Use in cycling|cobbled sections]], Hinault suffered two [[Flat tire#Bicycles|punctures]], losing almost four minutes and the race lead to Zoetemelk.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=119}} He took back 36 seconds on the time trial in [[Brussels]] on stage 11 before regaining the race lead after another time trial, uphill to [[Avoriaz]] on stage 15.

Hinault gained another minute on stage 16, before Zoetemelk regained 47 seconds up Alpe d'Huez three days later. The final time trial of the Tour went Hinault's way once again, extending his advantage by a further 69 seconds. He also took the next stage in a slightly uphill sprint finish.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=119\u2013122}} On the final stage towards the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] in [[Paris]], traditionally [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es stage in the Tour de France|a ceremonious affair without attacks]], Zoetemelk and Hinault broke away, with both gapping the field and Hinault taking another stage victory. Zoetemelk finished 3:07 minutes behind Hinault, but then had ten minutes added to his time for failing a doping test. The next finisher, [[Joaquim Agostinho]], was almost half an hour behind the winner.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=114\u2013116}}\n\nTowards the end of the season, Hinault won his second cycling monument, the [[1979 Giro di Lombardia|Giro di Lombardia]].

Only [[Silvano Contini]] finished with him, with the next group more than three minutes behind.

As soon as the riders left [[Li\u00e8ge]], snow began to fall, soon turning into a blizzard. Hinault wanted to abandon, as had many others, including all but one of his teammates. He was convinced to carry on until the feeding station at [[Bastogne]], where the snow had turned into rain. Only 21 riders were left by this point. Hinault removed his rain cape and attacked, catching up to the leaders and carried on by himself, winning with a margin of almost ten minutes ahead of Kuiper.

On stage 5, a time trial to [[Pisa]], Hinault took over the race leader's [[pink jersey]]. He then relinquished his lead to [[Roberto Visentini]], who was not considered to be a contender for the final victory. On stage 14, he attacked when the peloton relaxed after an intermediate sprint, winning the stage ahead of [[Wladimiro Panizza]], who took the race lead. Hinault then made the decisive move of the race on stage 20, when he attacked on the tough climb of the [[Stelvio Pass]].

He eventually found himself in a group with several other riders, while Zoetemelk was distanced. At {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish, he followed another attack from Kuiper and won the sprint at the line. The next stage was set to contain more cobbled roads, but on Hinault's protest, most of the worst parts were taken out.

On stage{{nbsp}}4 of the Vuelta, Fignon attacked and won, but Lejarreta, the defending champion, had followed him and gained time on Hinault. Hinault came back and took the lead the following day on the mountain stage to [[Castellar de n'Hug]]. However, a day later, the Spanish teams jointly attacked and Lejarreta moved ahead of Hinault, who was 22 seconds down. At the uphill time trial at [[Panticosa|Balneario de Panticosa]], he suffered and finished more than two minutes behind Lejarreta. Hinault joined forces with Kuiper and Saronni to attack on stage 10 to [[Soria]], affected by crosswinds. He was in trouble again on stage 14, affected by returning pain in his knee; at one point he trailed his rivals by more than five minutes, but regained contact. In the time trial around [[Valladolid]] on stage 15b, Hinault won, now just ten seconds behind Gorospe, the new leader in the general classification. The following day brought the last mountain stage and Renault put pressure on Gorospe from early on. Hinault, joined by Lejarreta and [[Vicente Belda]], escaped for {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}}, distancing Gorospe by over twenty minutes with Hinault taking victory in [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]], sealing his second Vuelta victory.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=186\u2013190}} Due to the tightly fought battle between Hinault and his Spanish competitors, the 1983 race is described on the Vuelta's website as \"one of the most beautiful and spectacular\" editions.<ref>{{cite web |title=A\u00f1o 1983 |trans-title=Year 1983|url=http://historia.lavuelta.com/es/anio.asp?a=1983 |website=LaVuelta.com |publisher=Unipublic |accessdate=16 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816204916/http://historia.lavuelta.com/es/anio_info.asp?_=1534452557208&a=1983 |archivedate=16 August 2018 |language=Spanish |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring the Vuelta, Hinault's tendinitis returned.

At the [[1984 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9|Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]], he came second to [[Mart\u00edn Ram\u00edrez (cyclist)|Mart\u00edn Ram\u00edrez]], who later claimed that Hinault and his team had tried to intimidate him during the final stage of the race.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=230\u2013231}} A memorable episode occurred during the [[1984 Paris\u2013Nice|Paris\u2013Nice]], a race he finished third overall. During stage{{nbsp}}5 to [[La Seyne-sur-Mer]], Hinault was descending in a lead group with several other favourites. As they reached the valley, the road was blocked by protesters, unhappy with the announced closure of a dockyard at [[La Ciotat]]. While the other riders stopped, he drove into the group head-on, dismounted, and punched the protester closest to him. In the ensuing fist fight, Hinault suffered a broken rib.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=199\u2013201}}\n\nThe [[1984 Tour de France|Tour de France]] was made out to be the big duel between Hinault and Fignon, who had just won the French National Championship.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=230\u2013231}}{{sfn|Moore|2014|p=133}} Hinault won the prologue, but Renault took the team time trial, 55 seconds ahead of La Vie Claire. He lost another 49 seconds to Fignon in the first long individual time trial, a discipline he had previously dominated. Following the second time trial, Hinault was only seventh on general classification, two minutes behind his adversary. The next stage led to Alpe d'Huez. Hinault attacked on the [[Rampe de Laffrey]], but Fignon was able to respond. The two exchanged attacks on the way up the climb, but it was in the valley that Hinault was able to draw out a gap of about a minute. On Alpe d'Huez itself, he was first passed by eventual stage winner [[Luis Herrera (cyclist)|Luis Herrera]]. When he started to slow, Fignon caught up to him and eventually dropped Hinault, who lost a further three minutes. He ultimately finished the Tour in second place, a significant ten minutes behind Fignon.{{sfn|Moore|2014|pages=133\u2013140}}\n\nHinaut managed to bounce back from his Tour defeat in the fall. In late September, he took his fifth and final victory at the Grand Prix des Nations, riding the {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} time trial at a then record speed of {{convert|44.19|kph|mph|abbr=on}}. Fignon could only manage fourth, more than two minutes behind. Next, he won the [[Trofeo Baracchi]], a two-man time trial, in which he competed with Moser. He then won the [[1984 Giro di Lombardia|Giro di Lombardia]] for a second time, breaking away from the group of favourites {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=251\u2013253}}\n\n====1985: The second Giro-Tour double====\nFor 1985, Greg LeMond switched teams from Renault to join Hinault at La Vie Claire.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=138}} Together, they entered the [[1985 Giro d'Italia|Giro d'Italia]]. During the race, Hinault was met with hostility from the home crowd, who supported local rider Francesco Moser. On the stage 12 time trial, Hinault took the pink jersey and opened the decisive gap to Moser, who would eventually finish second. During the stage however, Hinault was spat at by spectators and almost knocked over, even though his team car rode behind him with the door opened the entire time to ensure that bystanders would have a harder time impeding him. Hinault won his third Giro with a margin of just over a minute.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=254\u2013255}}\n\nIn the [[1985 Tour de France|Tour de France]], Fignon did not take part due to an Achilles heel injury. Hinault therefore entered the race as the favourite. He took victory in the prologue in his native [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]]. La Vie Claire won the stage{{nbsp}}3 team time trial by over a minute. The next day, Hinault's teammate [[Kim Andersen (cyclist)|Kim Andersen]] took over the yellow jersey. Hinault supported him over the next days, even going so far as dropping back when Andersen punctured to lead him back into the peloton, showing his loyalty to riders who would later have to assist him. On stage 8, a time trial to [[Strasbourg]], Hinault took back the race lead, winning the stage by more than two minutes ahead of [[Stephen Roche]]. While the race travelled through the Alps and in a second time trial, he consolidated his lead, building an advantage of five-and-a-half minutes on LeMond, who was now second overall.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pages=150\u2013160}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"I'll stir things up to help Greg win, and I'll have fun doing it.

On stage 17, he showed signs of weakness and was unable to stay with the other leaders on the [[Col du Tourmalet]]. LeMond meanwhile followed an attack by Roche, but was forbidden by the team to cooperate to distance Hinault. LeMond would later claim that the team had deceived him by telling him that Hinault was closer behind than he actually was. Hinault eventually finished the stage just over a minute behind LeMond. The time LeMond waited may have been enough so that the two teammates would have contested the [[Maillot Jaune]] in the penultimate time trial. In the penultimate day's time trial, LeMond won the stage, but only five seconds ahead of Hinault, not enough to surpass him. This secured Hinault a record-equalling fifth Tour victory, by just under two minutes over his younger teammate.

He led the way up the climb, lined by approximately 300,000 spectators and crossed the finish line hand in hand with LeMond, in an apparent display of comradery. [[Urs Zimmermann]], who had been second overall at the start of the day, lost more than five minutes.<ref name=alpedhuez/> Any signs of appeasement between the rivalling teammates was shattered by Hinault in a television interview shortly after the stage finish, when he declared that the race was not yet over, even though he trailed LeMond by 2:45 minutes.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pages=255\u2013258}}\n\nStage 20 saw the final time trial and the last chance for Hinault to overcome LeMond's advantage.

The riders' strike at Valence d'Agen in the 1978 Tour is cited as the first instance in which Hinault assumed this role.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=11\u201312}} His fellow riders stated that he, even though he did not talk much, was able to exert a high amount of certainty and therefore strength, which brought him respect and sometimes fear from his competitors.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=159}} To signal his authority, Hinault often symbolically rode at the front of the field, instead of in the slipstream of his teammates.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=205\u2013206}} His riding style has been described as \"fighting, full of aggression\", and he stated that when he did not feel good in a race, his reaction would be to attack.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=111}} Hinault described his own role as follows:\n{{quote|You are like a soldier, a general who dominates, who imposes his will on the others. I believe that you are born like that. Some are born to be workers, others to be in charge. I could have been a warlord. I would have waged war to win castles and land if I'd been born in the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=203}}}}\n{{quote box|quote=\"Now, let's love him.\"<br /> Headline of the sports newspaper ''[[L'Equipe]]'' on the day after Hinault lost the [[1984 Tour de France]] to [[Laurent Fignon]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=239}}|width=20%|align=right}}\nHinault was however not always successful in his endeavours. During the 1980 Tour de France, he sought to remove the rule which excluded riders outside the time limit on each stage. He urged the riders to protest and ride slowly, but some did not follow his example, forcing Hinault to chase them down before he eventually left the race.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Der Zorn des Bretonen |journal=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=21 July 1980 |issue=30/1980 |pages=127\u2013128 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14315965.html |accessdate=10 January 2019 |trans-title=The Breton's Fury |language=German}}</ref> His enigmatic exit from the 1980 Tour created tensions with the press that would persist during the rest of his active career. By 1982, debates about his personality started to appear more and more in the media. Particular interest was given to an alleged lack of ''panache'' during his Tour wins and his behaviour towards fans and officials, whom he treated with open disgust.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=166\u2013167 & 176\u2013177}} Fotheringham suggests that Hinault only regained popularity with the French public after his knee problems and his Tour defeat in 1984.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=18}} Fellow racer Robert Millar suggested that in 1986 in particular, Hinault attempted to win over the French public by riding aggressively.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=289\u2013290}}\n\nHinault was not known to particularly enjoy going on training rides, unless he was specifically preparing for an event. He would often greet his training partners in a night gown when they arrived on time for training or have an easy day of training that included stops at a bakery for cake. His distaste for training became even more evident in the winter, when he would gain a lot of weight. Laurent Fignon described the first training camps of the year as follows: \"He looked as if he had been inflated. If you didn't know the Badger you would wonder how long it would take for him to get back to what he had been. You would be making a huge mistake.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=169}} Hinault was capable of suffering through the training camp and returning to winning form within a month.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=168\u2013170}} Unlike a rider like Eddy Merckx, Hinault would not aim to win every race he entered. Millar described his approach as such: \"Hinault either cared or he didn't. When he didn't care about winning he'd bumble round and hurt you now and again just to remind you he was there.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=17\u201318}}\n\nWith a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of victories that includes all three Grand Tours (all of them more than once), the World Road Championships and a number of classics, Hinault has often been cited among the greatest cyclists of all time.<ref name=\"cn_greatest\"/><ref name=\"greatest\">{{cite magazine |title=Who is the greatest Grand Tour rider ever? |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/who-is-the-greatest-grand-tour-rider-ever-175929 |magazine=[[Cycling Weekly]] |accessdate=14 November 2018 |date=14 October 2014}}</ref> The ''Historical Dictionary of Cycling'' describes him as \"one of the best riders ever\".<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Heijmans |editor1-first=Jeroen |editor2-last=Mallon |editor2-first=Bill |title=Historical Dictionary of Cycling |date=2011 |publisher=The Scarecrow Press |location=Plymouth |isbn=978-0-8108-7175-5 |pages=102\u2013103}}</ref> Comparisons are often drawn with Eddy Merckx, against whom Hinault rode at the beginning of his career. Lucien Van Impe commented: \"Merckx was the greatest, but Bernard [Hinault] was the most impressive.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=17}} A study conducted in 2006, ranking Tour de France riders from 1953 to 2004 by different performance indicators, put Hinault as the top Tour rider of that period, ahead of Merckx and [[Lance Armstrong]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cherchye |first1=Laurens |last2=Vermeulen |first2=Frederic |title=Robust Rankings of Multidimensional Performances |journal=[[Journal of Sports Economics]] |date=2006 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=359\u2013373 |doi=10.1177/2F1527002505275092|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1527002505275092?ck=nck|access-date=24 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Nickname ===\nHinault was nicknamed ''le [[wikt:blaireau#French|blaireau]]'' in French, a term that can be translated into English as either \"the shaving brush\" or \"the badger\". According to Fotheringham, the nickname originates from Hinault's early training partners, [[Maurice Le Guilloux]] and [[Georges Talbourdet]], who would use the term to tease the young rider. Le Guilloux used it once in front of Pierre Chany, a writer for ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'', and the name stuck.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=154\u2013155}}{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=21}} According to Hinault himself, the term in the first place was supposed to mean no more than \"mate\" or \"buddy\".{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=14}} However, Hinault later embraced the association with the wild animal. In 2003, he commented: \"A badger is a beautiful thing. When it's hunted it goes into its sett and waits. When it comes out again, it attacks. That's the reason for my nickname. When I'm annoyed I go home, you don't see me for a month. When I come out again, I win.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=156}} Hinault, as early as 1983, owned a stuffed badger to demonstrate his association with the animal.<ref name=tourdeforce/>\n\n=== Stance on doping ===\nHinault never tested positive for [[performance-enhancing drugs]] during his professional career and was never implicated in any doping practices.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dopingf\u00e4lle bei der Frankreich-Rundfahrt \u2013 Die Tour-T\u00e4ter |trans-title=Doping cases at the Tour de France - The Tour perpetrators|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/dopingfaelle-bei-der-tour-de-france-die-tour-taeter-1.117049-13 |newspaper=[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]] |accessdate=10 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110224345/https://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/dopingfaelle-bei-der-tour-de-france-die-tour-taeter-1.117049-13 |archivedate=10 January 2019 |language=German |date=6 February 2012}}</ref> He did, however, lead a riders' protest during a criterium race in [[Callac]] in 1982 against the sudden introduction of doping controls. He was handed a one-month suspended ban and fined [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 1,110, though the penalty was never enforced.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=205}}\n\nHinault has been outspoken about several prominent doping cases in the past years. In 2013, he heavily criticised [[Senate (France)|French senators]] for revealing the results of tests conducted in 2004 on samples from the [[1998 Tour de France]]. He called the initiative \"bullshit\" and urged lawmakers \"to stop bringing out the dead\", claiming they \"want to kill the Tour\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Hinault fears for Tour de France in light of doping drama |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/hinault-fears-for-tour-de-france-in-light-of-doping-drama/ |website=[[Cyclingnews.com]] |accessdate=11 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111105143/http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/hinault-fears-for-tour-de-france-in-light-of-doping-drama/ |archivedate=11 January 2019 |date=27 June 2013}}</ref> In the same year, he reacted to comments made by [[Lance Armstrong]], a rider stripped of seven Tour victories due to doping offences. Armstrong suggested that it would be impossible to win the Tour de France without performance-enhancing substances. To counter this claim, Hinault replied: \"He must not know what it was like to ride without doping.\" Armstrong later clarified that he had spoken about the time when he was riding (1999\u20132005).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pretot |first1=Julien |title=Winning without doping was impossible: Armstrong |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cycling-doping-armstrong-idUSBRE95R0QZ20130628 |accessdate=11 January 2019 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=28 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111110438/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cycling-doping-armstrong-idUSBRE95R0QZ20130628 |archivedate=11 January 2019 |location=Porto Vecchio}}</ref> In early 2018, Hinault also spoke out about the adverse analytical result for [[salbutamol]] of four-time Tour winner [[Chris Froome]] at the [[2017 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]]. He criticised Froome for taking part in the [[2018 Giro d'Italia]] while the investigation was still ongoing. In addition, he commented that Froome could not be \"listed among the cycling greats\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kelner |first1=Martha |title=Chris Froome should not be listed with cycling greats, says Hinault |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/29/chris-froome-cycling-bernard-hinault-giro-ditalia |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=11 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111110911/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/29/chris-froome-cycling-bernard-hinault-giro-ditalia |archivedate=11 January 2019 |date=30 May 2018}}</ref> Froome would win the Giro and become the first rider since Hinault to hold all three [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tour]] Jerseys at once.

[[Museum Plantin-Moretus]], [[Antwerp]], Belgium.]]\n\nMechanical [[astronomical clock]]s were initially influenced by the astrolabe; they could be seen in many ways as clockwork astrolabes designed to produce a continual display of the current position of the sun, stars, and planets. For example, [[Richard of Wallingford]]'s clock (c. 1330) consisted essentially of a star map rotating behind a fixed rete, similar to that of an astrolabe.{{sfn|North| 2005}}\n\nMany astronomical clocks use an astrolabe-style display, such as the famous [[Prague Orloj|clock at Prague]], adopting a stereographic projection (see below) of the ecliptic plane. In recent times, astrolabe watches have become popular. For example, Swiss watchmaker [[Ludwig Oechslin|Dr. Ludwig Oechslin]] designed and built an astrolabe wristwatch in conjunction with [[Ulysse Nardin]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ulysse-nardin.ch/en/swiss_watch_manufacturer/Collection/Archive/Astrolabium_G._Galilei.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102024043/http://www.ulysse-nardin.ch/en/swiss_watch_manufacturer/Collection/Archive/Astrolabium_G._Galilei.html |archive-date=2 January 2011 |title=Astrolabium G.

A [[tympan]] is made for a specific [[latitude]] and is engraved with a [[stereographic projection]] of [[circle]]s denoting [[azimuth]] and [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] and representing the portion of the [[celestial sphere]] above the local horizon. The rim of the mater is typically graduated into [[hour|hours of time]], [[Degree (angle)|degrees of arc]], or both.<ref name=\"Stephenson 2000 108\u2013109\">{{cite book |last=Stephenson|first=Bruce |first2=Marvin|last2=Bolt |first3=Anna Felicity|last3=Friedman |title=The Universe Unveiled: Instruments and Images through History|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-79143-X|pages=108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nAbove the mater and tympan, the ''rete'', a framework bearing a projection of the [[ecliptic]] plane and several [[Pointer (rod)|pointers]] indicating the positions of the brightest [[star]]s, is free to rotate. These pointers are often just simple points, but depending on the skill of the craftsman can be very elaborate and artistic. There are examples of astrolabes with artistic pointers in the shape of balls, stars, snakes, hands, dogs' heads, and leaves, among others.<ref name=\"Stephenson 2000 108\u2013109\"/> The names of the indicated stars were often engraved on the pointers in Arabic or Latin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/astrolabe.htm|title=Star Names on Astrolabes|publisher=Ian Ridpath|accessdate=2016-11-12}}</ref> Some astrolabes have a narrow ''[[ruler|rule]]'' or ''label'' which rotates over the rete, and may be marked with a scale of [[declination]]s.\n\nThe rete, representing the [[sky]], functions as a [[star chart]]. When it is rotated, the stars and the [[ecliptic]] move over the projection of the coordinates on the tympan. One complete rotation corresponds to the passage of a day. The astrolabe is, therefore, a predecessor of the modern [[planisphere]].\n\nOn the back of the mater, there is often engraved a number of scales that are useful in the astrolabe's various applications. These vary from designer to designer, but might include curves for time conversions, a [[calendar]] for converting the day of the month to the sun's position on the ecliptic, trigonometric scales, and graduation of 360 degrees around the back edge. The ''[[alidade]]'' is attached to the back face. An alidade can be seen in the lower right illustration of the Persian astrolabe above. When the astrolabe is held vertically, the alidade can be rotated and the sun or a star sighted along its length, so that its altitude in degrees can be read (\"taken\") from the graduated edge of the astrolabe; hence the word's Greek roots: \"astron\" (\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd) = star + \"lab-\" (\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2-) = to take.\n\n{{Gallery\n |title=Construction of astrolabes\n |align=center\n |File:Yale's Hartmann astrolabe.jpg|The [[Georg Hartmann|Hartmann]] astrolabe in [[Yale University|Yale]] collection.

These vary from designer to designer, but might include curves for time conversions, a [[calendar]] for converting the day of the month to the sun's position on the ecliptic, trigonometric scales, and graduation of 360 degrees around the back edge.

{"title_page": "Biolinguistics", "text_new": "{{short description|The study of the biology and evolution of language}}\n[[File:Palmarini Pio Manz\u00f9.jpg|thumb|Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini]]\n'''Biolinguistics''' can be defined as the study of biology and the evolution of language. It is a highly interdisciplinary as it related to various fields such as [[biology]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and [[neurolinguistics]] to explain the formation of language. It is important as it seeks to yield a framework by which we can understand the fundamentals of the faculty of language. This field was first introduced by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, professor of Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the [[University of Arizona]]. It was first introduced in 1971, at an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). Biolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\". Hacettepe \u00fcniversitesi E\u011fitim Fak\u00fcltesi \u00d6\u011fretim \u00fcyesi.  https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/88422</ref> Chomsky and Lenneberg militated against it by arguing for the innate knowledge of language. Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Darwins theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions i) Whether individuals undergo something like selection as they evolve, and ii) selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, weather the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power or just one of the several contributing causes. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]]. Darwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars much as Max M\u00fcller by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, also stimulates brain development, enabling long trains of though and strengthening power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and variation, and remarking on how each development gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\nThe first phase in the development of biolinguistics runs through the late 1960's with the publicaiton of Lennberg's Biological Foundation of Language (1967). The range of topics under active investigation on the biology of language during this period included: language acquisition, genetics of language disorders (dyslexia, specific lanuage disabilities, deaf children), and the evolution of language. During the first phase work was carried out in three specific areas; language, development of language, and, evolution of language. The greatest progress was made in the area regarding the specifying the notion on language. \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

In 1976 Chomsky formulated the fundamental questions of biolingusitcs as follows: i) function, ii) structure, iii) physical basis, iv) development in the individual, v) evolutionary development. In the late 1980's a great deal of progress was made in answering  question about the development of language. This then prompted further questions about language design. function, and, the evolution of language.  \nThe following year, Juan Uriagereka, a graduate student of Howard Lasnik, wrote the introductory text to Minimalist Syntax, Rhyme and Reason. Their work renewed interest in biolinguistics, catalysing many linguists to look into biolinguistics with their colleagues in adjacent scientific disciplines.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Di Sciullo |first1=Anna Maria |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=The Biolinguistic Enterprise: New Perspectives on the Evolution and Nature of the Human Language Faculty Volume 1 of Oxford Studies in Biolinguistics |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press, 2011 |isbn=9780199553273 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6REUDAAAQBAJ&dq=origins+of+biolinguistics}}</ref> Both Jenkins and Uriagereka stressed the importance of addressing the emergence of the language faculty in humans. At around the same time, [[geneticist]]s discovered a link between the language deficit manifest by the [[KE family]] members and the gene [[FOXP2]].

While Professor [[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]] claims that the interdisciplinary research of biology and linguistics in the 1950s-1960s led to the rise of biolinguistics. Furthermore, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics, originating in the 1970s, is distinct transformational grammar; rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n=== Chomsky's Theories ===\n \n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

Chomsky's work is often recognized as the weak perspective of biolinguistics as it does not pull from other fields of study outside of linguistics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pleyer|first=Michael|last2=Hartmann|first2=Stefan|date=2019-11-14|title=Constructing a Consensus on Language Evolution?

The [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was \u00a0presented as an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Individuals are thought to be \u201cwired\u201d with universal grammar rules enabling them to understand and evaluate complex syntactic structures. Proponents of the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being exposed to a rich linguistic environment. Later, Chomsky exchanged this notion instead for that of Universal Grammar, providing evidence for a biological basis of language. \n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

In order to build a tree using Merge, using bottom-up formation the two final element of the phrase are selected and then combined to form a new element on the tree.

As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|archivedate=2007-02-21|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. [[Natural law|Natural Law]] in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees and well as the Merge operation. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree (Refer to trees above in ''Minimalist Program''). By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\n==== Biolinguistics: Challenging the Usage-Based Approach ====\nAs mentioned above, biolinguistics challenges the idea that the acquisition of language is a result of behavior based learning. This alternative approach the biolinguistics challenges is known as the usage-based (UB) approach. UB supports that idea that knowledge of human language is acquired via exposure and usage <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=Paul|date=2013|title=The Scope of Usage-Based Theory|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255/full#B163|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255|issn=1664-1078|doi-access=free}}</ref>. One of the primary issues that is highlighted when arguing against the Usage-Based approach, is that UB fails to address the issue of poverty of stimulus<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ghalebi|first=Rezvan|last2=Sadighi|first2=Firooz|date=2015-08-06|title=The Usage-based Theory of Language Acquisition: A review of Major Issues|url=http://www.jallr.com/index.php/JALLR/article/view/138|journal=Journal of Applied Linguistics and Language Research|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=190\u2013195|issn=2376-760X}}</ref>, whereas biolinguistics addresses this by way of the Language Acquisition Device.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. This intergration of other fields to explain language is recognized as the ''strong'' view in biolinguistics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|last2=Grohmann|first2=Kleanthes K.|date=2007|title=The BIOLINGUISTICS Manifesto|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/26|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=1|pages=001\u2013008|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Recent Developments ==\n'''Generative Procedure Accepted At Present & Its Developments'''\n\nIn biolinguistics, language is recognised to be based on recursive generative procedure that retrieves words from the lexicon and applies them repeatedly to output phrases. This generative procedure was hypothesised to be a result of a minor brain mutation due to evidence that word ordering is limited to externalisation and plays no role in core syntax or semantics. Thus, different lines of inquiry to explain this were explored. \n\nThe most commonly accepted line of inquiry to explain this is [[Noam Chomsky]]'s minimalist approach to syntactic representations. In 2016, Chomsky and Berwick defined the [[minimalist program]] under the Strong Minimalist Thesis in their book ''Why Only Us'' by saying that language is mandated by efficient computations and, thus, keeps to the simplest recursive operations. The main basic operation in the minimalist program is [[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]. Under merge there are two ways in which larger expressions can be constructed: externally and internally. Lexical items that are merged externally build argument representations with disjoint constituents. The internal merge creates constituent structures where one is a part of another. This induces [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], the capacity to pronounce phrases in one position, but interpret them elsewhere. \n\nRecent investigations of displacement concur to a slight rewiring in cortical brain regions that could have occurred historically and perpetuated generative grammar. Upkeeping this line of thought, in 2009, Ramus and Fishers speculated that a single gene could create a signalling molecule to facilitate new brain connections or a new area of the brain altogether via prenatally defined brain regions. This would result in information processing greatly important to language, as we know it. The spread of this advantage trait could be responsible for secondary externalisation and the interaction we engage in.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/why-only-us|title=Why Only Us {{!}} The MIT Press|last=Press|first=The MIT|website=mitpress.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n''' Human versus Animal Communication '''\n\nCompared to other topics in linguistics where data can be displayed with evidence cross-linguistically, due to the nature of biolinguistics, and that it is applies to the entirety of linguistics rather than just a specific subsection, examining other species can assist in providing data. Although animals do not have the same linguistic competencies as humans, is it assumed that they can provide evidence for some linguistic competence.  \n\nOver the last twenty five years, clarifications on the fundamental features of human language have been carried out, which has at the same time, deepened knowledge on the communicative abilities and cognitive processes of non-human animals. [[Animal communication]] can be defined as the transfer of information by an animal that proves a change in the behaviour of the receiver of the information. <ref> Preece, K., & Beekman, M. (2014). Honeybee waggle dance error: Adaption or constraint? Unravelling the complex dance language of honeybees. Animal Behaviour, 94, 19-26 </ref> The concept that has been claimed as the main factor of human language is the syntactic operation of centre-embedded recursion. <ref> Bar\u00f3n Birchenall, Leonardo. (2016). Animal communication and human language: An overview. International journal of comparative psychology / ISCP; sponsored by the International Society for Comparative Psychology and the University of Calabria. 29. 1-27 </ref> Non-human primates (NHP) know a lot about their environment, however they seem to be unable to intentionally communication this knowledge to others, at least through vocalizations. Overall, animal communicative abilities appear to be highly restricted to survival matters. Additionally, non-human animals apparently do not intend to convey information to others when communicating.  \n\nComparing animal language to human language acquisition, in regards to repertoire of elements used for communicative purposes (sounds or signs), the \u201cvocabulary\u201d of animals does not get anywhere close to that of humans. By the age of three years old, a neurotypical child produces an estimate of 500 different words, and can comprehend at least double that. <ref> Gershkoff-Stowe, L., & Hahn, E. (2007). Fast mapping skills in the developing lexicon. Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, 50, 682-697 </ref> An average adult, graduated from university has a repertoire of about 20,000 word families. In comparison the animal with the largest repertoire, the common nightingale includes 200 different elements. <ref> Colbert-White, E., Corballis, M., & Fragaszy, D. (2014). Where apes and songbirds are left behind: A comparative assessment of the requisites for speech. Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews, 9, 1-28 </ref> Elements of language acquisition that are found within human languages such as a lexical explosion period or [[fast mapping]] do not seem apparent within non-human animals. It is possible that the phylogenetic development of human language relies on ancient perceptual capacities already present in birds and some mammals. Those capacities would have converged at a certain point of the evolution with skills for structural organization and conceptual abstraction, already existent in humans, and not necessarily present in the species of which perceptual abilities were inherited. <ref> Heimbauer, A. (2012). Investigating speech perception in evolutionary perspective: Comparisons of chimpanzee (Pantroglodytes) and human capabilities (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). Georgia State University, Georgia </ref> Human language ability is constituted by a multiplicity of factors, which are shared to one degree or another with other species. \n\n'''Relevant Biological & Evolutionary Research'''\n\nThe relatively new science of [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evo-devo]] that suggests everyone is a common descendant from a single tree has opened pathways into gene and biochemical study. One way in which this manifested within biolinguistics is through the suggestion of a common language gene, namely [[FOXP2|FOXP2.]] Though this gene is subject to debate, there have been interesting recent discoveries made concerning it and the part it plays in the secondary externalization process. Recent studies of birds and mice resulted in an emerging consensus that FOXP2 is not a blueprint for internal syntax nor the narrow faculty of language, but rather makes up the regulatory machinery pertaining to the process of externalization. The fact that it has been found to assists sequencing sound or gesture one after the next, hence implying that FOXP2 helps transfer knowledge from declarative to procedural memory. Therefore, FOXP2 has been discovered to be an aid in formulating a linguistic\u00a0 input-output system that runs smoothly.\n\n==Critiques==\n'''Alternative Theoretical Approaches'''\n\nStemming from the usage-based approach, the [[Competition Model]], developed by [[Elizabeth Bates]] and [[Brian MacWhinney]], views language acquisition as consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon a linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues with the use of competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nFrom the side of [[biosemiotics]], the has been a recent claim that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language. This meaning-making consists internal and external cognitive processes. Thus, it holds that such process organisation could not have only given a rise to language alone. According to this perspective all living things possess these processes, regardless of how wide the variation, as a posed to species-specific.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\n\n'''Over-Emphasised Weak Stream Focus''' \n\nWhen talking about biolinguistics there are two senses that are adopted to the term: strong and weak biolinguistics. The weak is founded on theoretical linguistics that is generativist in persuasion. On the other hand, the strong stream goes beyond the commonly explored theoretical linguistics, with an oriented towards biology, as well as other relevant fields of study.\u00a0 Since the early emergence of biolinguistics to its present day, there has been a focused mainly on the weak stream, seeing little difference between the inquiry into generative linguistics and the biological nature of language as well as heavily relying on the Chomskyan origin of the term.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Martins|first=Pedro Tiago|last2=Boeckx|first2=Cedric|date=2016-12-01|title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/lingvan/open-issue/article-10.1515-lingvan-2016-0007/article-10.1515-lingvan-2016-0007.xml|journal=Linguistics Vanguard|language=en|volume=-1|issue=open-issue|doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007}}</ref> \n\nAs expressed by research professor and linguist Cedric Boeckx, it is a prevalent opinion that biolinguistics need to focus on biology as to give substance to the linguistic theorizing this field has engaged in. Particular criticisms mentioned\u00a0 include a lack of distinction between generative linguistics and biolinguistics, lack of discoveries pertaining to properties of grammar in the context of biology, and lack of recognition for the importance broader mechanisms, such as  biological non-linguistic properties. After all, it is only advantage to label propensity for language as biological if such insight is used towards a research.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has additionally noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem.'' Due to this different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Poeppel|first=David|title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones|last2=Embick|first2=David|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|year=2005|editor=Anne Cutler|chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience}}</ref>\n\nA recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general was developed by Prakash Mondal who shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representational character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

It is a highly interdisciplinary as it related to various fields such as [[biology]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and [[neurolinguistics]] to explain the formation of language. It is important as it seeks to yield a framework by which we can understand the fundamentals of the faculty of language. This field was first introduced by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, professor of Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the [[University of Arizona]]. It was first introduced in 1971, at an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). Biolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Darwins theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions i) Whether individuals undergo something like selection as they evolve, and ii) selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, weather the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power or just one of the several contributing causes. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]]. Darwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars much as Max M\u00fcller by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, also stimulates brain development, enabling long trains of though and strengthening power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and variation, and remarking on how each development gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\nThe first phase in the development of biolinguistics runs through the late 1960's with the publicaiton of Lennberg's Biological Foundation of Language (1967). The range of topics under active investigation on the biology of language during this period included: language acquisition, genetics of language disorders (dyslexia, specific lanuage disabilities, deaf children), and the evolution of language. During the first phase work was carried out in three specific areas; language, development of language, and, evolution of language. The greatest progress was made in the area regarding the specifying the notion on language. \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

In 1976 Chomsky formulated the fundamental questions of biolingusitcs as follows: i) function, ii) structure, iii) physical basis, iv) development in the individual, v) evolutionary development. In the late 1980's a great deal of progress was made in answering  question about the development of language. This then prompted further questions about language design. function, and, the evolution of language.  \nThe following year, Juan Uriagereka, a graduate student of Howard Lasnik, wrote the introductory text to Minimalist Syntax, Rhyme and Reason. Their work renewed interest in biolinguistics, catalysing many linguists to look into biolinguistics with their colleagues in adjacent scientific disciplines.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Di Sciullo |first1=Anna Maria |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=The Biolinguistic Enterprise: New Perspectives on the Evolution and Nature of the Human Language Faculty Volume 1 of Oxford Studies in Biolinguistics |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press, 2011 |isbn=9780199553273 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6REUDAAAQBAJ&dq=origins+of+biolinguistics}}</ref> Both Jenkins and Uriagereka stressed the importance of addressing the emergence of the language faculty in humans.

Furthermore, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics, originating in the 1970s, is distinct transformational grammar; rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n=== Chomsky's Theories ===\n \n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

The [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was \u00a0presented as an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Individuals are thought to be \u201cwired\u201d with universal grammar rules enabling them to understand and evaluate complex syntactic structures. Proponents of the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being exposed to a rich linguistic environment. Later, Chomsky exchanged this notion instead for that of Universal Grammar, providing evidence for a biological basis of language. \n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]</ref> \nThe program further aims to develop ideas involving the [[economy of derivation]] and [[economy of representation]], which had started to become an independent theory in the early 1990s, but were then still considered as peripherals of [[transformational grammar]].<ref>For a full description of the checking mechanism see [[David Adger|Adger, David]]. 2003.

Blackwell Publishers</ref> \n\nThe [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] operation is used by Chomsky to explain the structure of syntax trees within the Minimalist program.  Merge itself is a process which provides the basis of phrasal formation as a result of taking two element within a phrase and combining them<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sciullo|first=Anna Maria Di|last2=Isac|first2=Daniela|date=2008-09-30|title=The Asymmetry of Merge|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/53|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=260\u2013290|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> In A.M. Di Sciullo & D. Isac's ''The Asymmetry of Merge'' (2008), they highlight the two key bases of Merge by Chomsky;\n\n* Merge is binary\n* Merge is recursive\n\nIn order to understand this, take the following sentence:  ''Emma dislikes pies''\n\nThis phrase can be broken down into its lexical items: \n\n[VP [DP Emma] [V' [V dislikes] [DP [D the] [NP pie]]]\n\nThe above phrasal representation allows for an understanding of each lexical item. In order to build a tree using Merge, using bottom-up formation the two final element of the phrase are selected and then combined to form a new element on the tree. In image a) you can see that the determiner ''the'' and the Noun Phrase ''pie''  are both selected. Through the process of Merge, the new formed element on the tree is the determiner Phrase (DP) which holds, ''the pie,'' which is visible in b).  <gallery>\nFile:The pie.png|a) Selection of the final two element of the phrase\nFile:DP the pie.png|b) The two selected elements are then \"merged\" and they produce one new constituent, known as the Determiner Phrase (DP)\nFile:Dislikes the pie.png|c) Selection of DP ''the pie'' with V ''dislikes''\nFile:V bar dslikesthepie.png|d) Merge operation has occurred, yielded new element on tree, V' (V-bar) \nFile:Emma dislikes the pie.png|e) Selection of V' ''dislikes the pie a''nd DP subject ''Emma''\nFile:Ling pie tree.png|f) Merge operation has undergone, yielded new element on tree; VP\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of the language faculty proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|archivedate=2007-02-21|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. [[Natural law|Natural Law]] in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees and well as the Merge operation. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree (Refer to trees above in ''Minimalist Program''). By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\n==== Biolinguistics: Challenging the Usage-Based Approach ====\nAs mentioned above, biolinguistics challenges the idea that the acquisition of language is a result of behavior based learning. This alternative approach the biolinguistics challenges is known as the usage-based (UB) approach. UB supports that idea that knowledge of human language is acquired via exposure and usage <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=Paul|date=2013|title=The Scope of Usage-Based Theory|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255/full#B163|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255|issn=1664-1078|doi-access=free}}</ref>. One of the primary issues that is highlighted when arguing against the Usage-Based approach, is that UB fails to address the issue of poverty of stimulus<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ghalebi|first=Rezvan|last2=Sadighi|first2=Firooz|date=2015-08-06|title=The Usage-based Theory of Language Acquisition: A review of Major Issues|url=http://www.jallr.com/index.php/JALLR/article/view/138|journal=Journal of Applied Linguistics and Language Research|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=190\u2013195|issn=2376-760X}}</ref>, whereas biolinguistics addresses this by way of the Language Acquisition Device.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. This intergration of other fields to explain language is recognized as the ''strong'' view in biolinguistics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|last2=Grohmann|first2=Kleanthes K.|date=2007|title=The BIOLINGUISTICS Manifesto|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/26|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=1|pages=001\u2013008|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Recent Developments ==\n'''Generative Procedure Accepted At Present & Its Developments'''\n\nIn biolinguistics, language is recognised to be based on recursive generative procedure that retrieves words from the lexicon and applies them repeatedly to output phrases. This generative procedure was hypothesised to be a result of a minor brain mutation due to evidence that word ordering is limited to externalisation and plays no role in core syntax or semantics. Thus, different lines of inquiry to explain this were explored. \n\nThe most commonly accepted line of inquiry to explain this is [[Noam Chomsky]]'s minimalist approach to syntactic representations. In 2016, Chomsky and Berwick defined the [[minimalist program]] under the Strong Minimalist Thesis in their book ''Why Only Us'' by saying that language is mandated by efficient computations and, thus, keeps to the simplest recursive operations. The main basic operation in the minimalist program is [[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]. Under merge there are two ways in which larger expressions can be constructed: externally and internally. Lexical items that are merged externally build argument representations with disjoint constituents. The internal merge creates constituent structures where one is a part of another. This induces [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], the capacity to pronounce phrases in one position, but interpret them elsewhere. \n\nRecent investigations of displacement concur to a slight rewiring in cortical brain regions that could have occurred historically and perpetuated generative grammar. Upkeeping this line of thought, in 2009, Ramus and Fishers speculated that a single gene could create a signalling molecule to facilitate new brain connections or a new area of the brain altogether via prenatally defined brain regions. This would result in information processing greatly important to language, as we know it. The spread of this advantage trait could be responsible for secondary externalisation and the interaction we engage in.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/why-only-us|title=Why Only Us {{!}} The MIT Press|last=Press|first=The MIT|website=mitpress.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n''' Human versus Animal Communication '''\n\nCompared to other topics in linguistics where data can be displayed with evidence cross-linguistically, due to the nature of biolinguistics, and that it is apply to the entirety of linguistics rather than just a specific subsection, examining other species can assist in providing this data. Although animals do not have the same linguistic competencies as humans, is it assumed that they can provide evidence for some linguistic competence. Over the last twenty five years, clarifications on the fundamental features of human language have been carried out, which has at the same time, deepened knowledge on the communicative abilities and cognitive processes of non-human animal. [[Animal communication]] can be defined in general terms, the transfer of information by an animal that proves a change in the behaviour of the receiver of the information <ref> Preece, K., & Beekman, M. (2014). Honeybee waggle dance error: Adaption or constraint? Unravelling the complex dance language of honeybees. Animal Behaviour, 94, 19-26 </ref> The concept that has been claimed as the main factor of human language is the syntactic operation of the centre-embedded recursion <ref> Bar\u00f3n Birchenall, Leonardo. (2016). Animal communication and human language: An overview. International journal of comparative psychology / ISCP; sponsored by the International Society for Comparative Psychology and the University of Calabria. 29. 1-27 </ref>.  Non-human primates (NHP) know a lot about their environment, however they seem to be unable to intentionally communication this knowledge to others, at least through vocalizations. Overall, animal communicative abilities appear to be highly restricted to survival matters. Additionally, non-human animals apparently do not intend to convey information to others when communicating. Comparing animal language to human language acquisition, in regards to repertoire of elements used for communicative purposes (sounds or signs), the \u201cvocabulary\u201d of animals does not get anywhere close to that of humans. By the age of three years old, a neurotypical child produces an estimate of 500 different words, and can comprehend at least double that <ref> Gershkoff-Stowe, L., & Hahn, E. (2007). Fast mapping skills in the developing lexicon. Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, 50, 682-697 </ref>. An average adult, graduated from university has a repertoire of about 20,000 word families. In comparison the animal with the largest repertoire, the common nightingale includes 200 different elements <ref> Colbert-White, E., Corballis, M., & Fragaszy, D. (2014). Where apes and songbirds are left behind: A comparative assessment of the requisites for speech. Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews, 9, 1-28 </ref>. Elements of language acquisition that are found within human languages such as a lexical explosion period or [[fast mapping]] do not seem apparent within non-human animals. It is possible that the phylogenetic development of human language relies on ancient perceptual capacities already present in birds and some mammals. Those capacities would have converged at a certain point of the evolution with skills for structural organization and conceptual abstraction, already existent in humans, and not necessarily present in the species of which perceptual abilities were inherited <ref> Heimbauer, A. (2012). Investigating speech perception in evolutionary perspective: Comparisons of chimpanzee (Pantroglodytes) and human capabilities (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). Georgia State University, Georgia </ref>. Human language ability is constituted by a multiplicity of factors, which are shared to one degree or another with other species. \n\n'''Relevant Biological & Evolutionary Research'''\n\nThe relatively new science of [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evo-devo]] that suggests everyone is a common descendant from a single tree has opened pathways into gene and biochemical study. One way in which this manifested within biolinguistics is through the suggestion of a common language gene, namely [[FOXP2|FOXP2.]] Though this gene is subject to debate, there have been interesting recent discoveries made concerning it and the part it plays in the secondary externalization process. Recent studies of birds and mice resulted in an emerging consensus that FOXP2 is not a blueprint for internal syntax nor the narrow faculty of language, but rather makes up the regulatory machinery pertaining to the process of externalization. The fact that it has been found to assists sequencing sound or gesture one after the next, hence implying that FOXP2 helps transfer knowledge from declarative to procedural memory. Therefore, FOXP2 has been discovered to be an aid in formulating a linguistic\u00a0 input-output system that runs smoothly.\n\n==Critiques==\n'''Alternative Theoretical Approaches'''\n\nStemming from the usage-based approach, the [[Competition Model]], developed by [[Elizabeth Bates]] and [[Brian MacWhinney]], views language acquisition as consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon a linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues with the use of competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nFrom the side of [[biosemiotics]], the has been a recent claim that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language. This meaning-making consists internal and external cognitive processes. Thus, it holds that such process organisation could not have only given a rise to language alone. According to this perspective all living things possess these processes, regardless of how wide the variation, as a posed to species-specific.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

The weak is founded on theoretical linguistics that is generativist in persuasion. On the other hand, the strong stream goes beyond the commonly explored theoretical linguistics, with an oriented towards biology, as well as other relevant fields of study.\u00a0 Since the early emergence of biolinguistics to its present day, there has been a focused mainly on the weak stream, seeing little difference between the inquiry into generative linguistics and the biological nature of language as well as heavily relying on the Chomskyan origin of the term.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Martins|first=Pedro Tiago|last2=Boeckx|first2=Cedric|date=2016-12-01|title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/lingvan/open-issue/article-10.1515-lingvan-2016-0007/article-10.1515-lingvan-2016-0007.xml|journal=Linguistics Vanguard|language=en|volume=-1|issue=open-issue|doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007}}</ref> \n\nAs expressed by research professor and linguist Cedric Boeckx, it is a prevalent opinion that biolinguistics need to focus on biology as to give substance to the linguistic theorizing this field has engaged in. Particular criticisms mentioned\u00a0 include a lack of distinction between generative linguistics and biolinguistics, lack of discoveries pertaining to properties of grammar in the context of biology, and lack of recognition for the importance broader mechanisms, such as  biological non-linguistic properties. After all, it is only advantage to label propensity for language as biological if such insight is used towards a research.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has additionally noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem.'' Due to this different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Poeppel|first=David|title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones|last2=Embick|first2=David|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|year=2005|editor=Anne Cutler|chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience}}</ref>\n\nA recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general was developed by Prakash Mondal who shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representational character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

While the conclusion of a deductive argument is certain, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument may be ''[[probable]]'', based upon the evidence given.<ref>{{cite book |last=Copi |first=I.M. |last2=Cohen |first2=C. |last3=Flage |first3=D.E. |year=2006 |title=Essentials of Logic |edition=Second |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=978-0-13-238034-8 }}</ref> Many dictionaries define inductive reasoning as the derivation of general principles from specific observations, though there are many inductive arguments that do not have that form.<ref>{{Citation\n|title = Deductive and Inductive Arguments\n|url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/ded-ind/\n|work = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n|quote = It is worth noting that some dictionaries and texts define \"deduction\" as reasoning from the general to specific and define \"induction\" as reasoning from the specific to the general. However, there are many inductive arguments that do not have that form, for example, 'I saw her kiss him, really kiss him, so I'm sure she's having an affair.'}}</ref> hello Bennet students why are you cheating\n\n==Types==\nThe following are types of inductive argument. Notice that, while similar, each has a different form.\n\n===Generalization===\nA generalization (more accurately, an ''inductive generalization'') proceeds from a premise about a [[statistical sample|sample]] to a conclusion about the [[statistical population|population]].\n\n: The proportion Q of the sample has attribute A.\n: Therefore:\n: The proportion Q of the population has attribute A.\n\n;Example\nThere are 20 balls\u2014either black or white\u2014in an urn. To estimate their respective numbers, you draw a sample of four balls and find that three are black and one is white. A good inductive generalization would be that there are 15 black and 5 white balls in the urn.\n\nHow much the premises support the conclusion depends upon (a) the number in the sample group, (b) the number in the population, and (c) the degree to which the sample represents the population (which may be achieved by taking a random sample). The [[hasty generalization]] and the [[biased sample]] are generalization fallacies.\n\n====Statistical and inductive generalization====\n:Of a sizeable random sample of voters surveyed, 66% support Measure Z.\n:Therefore, approximately 66% of voters support Measure Z.\n\nThis is a ''Statistical'',<ref>Schaum\u2019s Outlines, Logic, Second Edition. John Nolt, Dennis Rohatyn, Archille Varzi. McGraw-Hill, 1998. p. 223</ref> aka ''Sample Projection.''<ref>Schaum\u2019s Outlines, Logic, p. 230</ref>\nThe measure is highly reliable within a well-defined margin of error provided the sample is large and random. It is readily quantifiable. Compare the preceding argument with the following. \u201cSix of the ten people in my book club are Libertarians. About 60% of people are Libertarians.\u201d The argument is weak because the sample is non-random and the sample size is very small.\n\n:So far, this year his son's Little League team has won 6 of ten games.\n:By season\u2019s end, they will have won about 60% of the games.\n\nThis is ''inductive generalization''. This inference is less reliable than the statistical generalization, first, because the sample events are non-random, and secondly because it is not reducible to mathematical expression. Statistically speaking, there is simply no way to know, measure and calculate as to the circumstances affecting performance that will obtain in the future. On a philosophical level, the argument relies on the presupposition that the operation of future events will mirror the past. In other words, it takes for granted a uniformity of nature, an unproven principle that cannot be derived from the empirical data itself. Arguments that tacitly presuppose this uniformity are sometimes called ''Humean'' after the philosopher who was first to subject them to philosophical scrutiny.<ref>Introduction to Logic. Gensler p. 280</ref>\n\n===Statistical syllogism===\n{{Main|Statistical syllogism}}\n\nA statistical syllogism proceeds from a generalization to a conclusion about an individual.\n\n:90% of graduates from Excelsior Preparatory school go on to University.\n:Bob is a graduate of Excelsior Preparatory school.\n:Bob will go on to University.\n\nThis is a ''statistical syllogism''.<ref name=\"Logic. Harry J 2002. p. 268\">Introduction to Logic. Harry J. Gensler, Rutledge, 2002. p. 268</ref> Even though one cannot be sure Bob will attend university, we can be fully assured of the exact probability for this outcome (given no further information). Arguably the argument is too strong and might be accused of \"cheating.\" After all, the probability is given in the premise. Typically, inductive reasoning seeks to ''formulate'' a probability. Two [[dicto simpliciter]] fallacies can occur in statistical syllogisms: \"[[accident (fallacy)|accident]]\" and \"[[converse accident]]\".\n\n===Simple induction===\nSimple induction proceeds from a premise about a sample group to a conclusion about another individual.\n\n: Proportion Q of the known instances of population P has attribute A.\n: Individual I is another member of P.\n: Therefore:\n: There is a probability corresponding to Q that I has A.\n\nThis is a combination of a generalization and a statistical syllogism, where the conclusion of the generalization is also the first premise of the statistical syllogism.\n\n===Enumerative induction===\nThe basic form of [[inductive inference]], simply ''induction'', reasons from particular instances to all instances, and is thus an unrestricted generalization.<ref>{{cite book|title=Logic: An Introduction|last=Churchill|first=Robert Paul|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0-312-02353-9|edition=2nd|location=New York|page=355|oclc=21216829|quote=In a typical enumerative induction, the premises list the individuals observed to have a common property, and the conclusion claims that all individuals of the same population have that property.}}</ref>  If one observes 100 swans, and all 100 were white, one might infer a universal [[categorical proposition]] of the form ''All swans are white''. As this [[argument form|reasoning form]]'s premises, even if true, do not entail the conclusion's truth, this is a form of inductive inference.  The conclusion might be true, and might be thought probably true, yet it can be false. Questions regarding the justification and form of enumerative inductions have been central in [[philosophy of science]], as enumerative induction has a pivotal role in the traditional model of the [[scientific method]].\n\n:All life forms so far discovered are composed of cells.\n:All life forms are composed of cells.\n\nThis is ''enumerative induction'', aka ''simple induction'' or ''simple predictive induction''. It is a subcategory of inductive generalization. In everyday practice, this is perhaps the most common form of induction. For the preceding argument, the conclusion is tempting but makes a prediction well in excess of the evidence. First, it assumes that life forms observed until now can tell us how future cases will be: an appeal to uniformity. Second, the concluding ''All'' is a very bold assertion. A single contrary instance foils the argument. And last, to quantify the level of probability in any mathematical form is problematic.<ref>Schaum\u2019s Outlines, Logic, pp. 243\u201335</ref> By what standard do we measure our Earthly sample of known life against all (possible) life? For suppose we do discover some new organism\u2014let's say some microorganism floating in the mesosphere, or better yet, on some asteroid\u2014and it is cellular. Doesn't the addition of this corroborating evidence oblige us to raise our probability assessment for the subject proposition? It is generally deemed reasonable to answer this question \"yes,\" and for a good many this \"yes\" is not only reasonable but incontrovertible. So then just ''how much'' should this new data change our probability assessment? Here, consensus melts away, and in its place arises a question about whether we can talk of probability coherently at all without numerical quantification.\n\n:All life forms so far discovered have been composed of cells.\n:The ''next'' life form discovered will be composed of cells.\n\nThis is enumerative induction in its ''weak form''. It truncates \"all\" to a mere single instance and, by making a far weaker claim, considerably strengthens the probability of its conclusion. Otherwise, it has the same shortcomings as the strong form: its sample population is non-random, and quantification methods are elusive.\n\n===Argument from analogy===\n{{Main|Argument from analogy}}\n\nThe process of analogical inference involves noting the shared properties of two or more things and from this basis inferring that they also share some further property:<ref name=\"Baronett\">{{Cite book|title=Logic|last=Baronett|first=Stan|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2008|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages=321\u201325}}</ref>\n\n:P and Q are similar in respect to properties a, b, and c.\n:Object P has been observed to have further property x.\n:Therefore, Q probably has property x also.\n\nAnalogical reasoning is very frequent in [[common sense]], [[science]], [[philosophy]] and the [[humanities]], but sometimes it is accepted only as an auxiliary method. A refined approach is [[case-based reasoning]].<ref>For more information on inferences by analogy, see [http://www.cs.hut.fi/Opinnot/T-93.850/2005/Papers/juthe2005-analogy.pdf Juthe, 2005].</ref>\n\n:Mineral A is an igneous rock often containing veins of quartz and most commonly found in South America in areas of ancient volcanic activity.\n:Additionally, mineral A is a soft stone suitable for carving into jewelry.\n:Mineral B is an igneous rock often containing veins of quartz and most commonly found in South America in areas of ancient volcanic activity.                                                \n:Mineral B is probably a soft stone suitable for carving into jewelry.\n\nThis is ''analogical induction'', according to which things alike in certain ways are more prone to be alike in other ways. This form of induction was explored in detail by philosopher John Stuart Mill in his ''System of Logic'', wherein he states:\n\n:\"There can be no doubt that every resemblance [not known to be irrelevant] affords some degree of probability, beyond what\n:would otherwise exist, in favour of the conclusion.\"<ref>A System of Logic. Mill 1843/1930. p. 333</ref>\n\nAnalogical induction is a subcategory of inductive generalization because it assumes a pre-established uniformity governing events. Analogical induction requires an auxiliary examination of the ''relevancy'' of the characteristics cited as common to the pair. In the preceding example, if I add the premise that both stones were mentioned in the records of early Spanish explorers, this common attribute is extraneous to the stones and does not contribute to their probable affinity.\n\nA pitfall of analogy is that features can be cherry-picked: while objects may show striking similarities, two things juxtaposed may respectively possess other characteristics not identified in the analogy that are characteristics sharply ''dis''similar. Thus, analogy can mislead if not all relevant comparisons are made.\n\n===Causal inference===\nA causal inference draws a conclusion about a causal connection based on the conditions of the occurrence of an effect. Premises about the correlation of two things can indicate a causal relationship between them, but additional factors must be confirmed to establish the exact form of the causal relationship.\n\n===Prediction===\nA prediction draws a conclusion about a future individual from a past sample.\n\n: Proportion Q of observed members of group G have had attribute A.\n: Therefore:\n: There is a probability corresponding to Q that other members of group G will have attribute A when next observed.\n\n==Comparison with deductive reasoning==\n[[File:Argument terminology used in logic (en).svg|thumb|400px|Argument terminology]]\nInductive reasoning is a form of argument that\u2014in contrast to deductive reasoning\u2014allows for the possibility that a conclusion can be false, even if all of the [[premise]]s are true.<ref>John Vickers. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/ The Problem of Induction]. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</ref> Instead of being valid or invalid, inductive arguments are either ''strong'' or ''weak'', according to how ''probable'' it is that the conclusion is true.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~bio125/logic.Giere.pdf | title = Logical Basis of Hypothesis Testing in Scientific Research | last = Herms | first = D. }}</ref> We may call an inductive argument plausible, probable, reasonable, justified or strong, but never certain or necessary. Logic affords no bridge from the probable to the certain.\n\nThe futility of attaining certainty through some critical mass of probability can be illustrated with a coin-toss exercise. Suppose someone shows us a coin and tests to see if the coin is either a fair one or two-headed. They flip the coin ten times, and ten times it comes up heads. At this point, there is a strong reason to believe it is two-headed. After all, the chance of ten heads in a row is .000976: less than one in one thousand. Then, after 100 flips, every toss has come up heads. Now there is \u201cvirtual\u201d certainty that the coin is two-headed. Still, one can neither logically nor empirically rule out that the next toss will produce tails. No matter how many times in a row it comes up heads this remains the case. If one programmed a machine to flip a coin over and over continuously at some point the result would be a string of 100 heads. In the fullness of time, all combinations will appear.\n\nAs for the slim prospect of getting ten out of ten heads from a fair coin\u2014the outcome that made the coin appear biased\u2014many may be surprised to learn that the chance of any sequence of heads or tails is equally unlikely (e.g. H-H-T-T-H-T-H-H-H-T) and yet it occurs in ''every'' trial of ten tosses. That means ''all'' results for ten tosses have the same probability as getting ten out of ten heads, which is 0.000976. If one records the heads-tails sequences, for whatever result, that exact sequence had a chance of 0.000976.\n\nAn argument is deductive when the conclusion is necessary given the premises. That is, the conclusion cannot be false if the premises are true.\n\nIf a deductive conclusion follows duly from its premises, then it is valid; otherwise, it is invalid (that an argument is invalid is not to say it is false. It may have a true conclusion, just not on account of the premises). An examination of the following examples will show that the relationship between premises and conclusion is such that the truth of the conclusion is already implicit in the premises. Bachelors are unmarried because we ''say'' they are; we have defined them so. Socrates is mortal because we have included him in a set of beings that are mortal. The conclusion for a valid deductive argument is already contained in the premises since its truth is strictly a matter of logical relations. It cannot say more than its premises. Inductive premises, on the other hand, draw their substance from fact and evidence, and the conclusion accordingly makes a factual claim or prediction. Its reliability varies proportionally with the evidence. Induction wants to reveal something ''new'' about the world. One could say that induction wants to say ''more'' than is contained in the premises.\n\nTo better see the difference between inductive and deductive arguments, consider that it would not make sense to say: \"all rectangles so far examined have four right angles, so the next one I see will have four right angles.\" This would treat logical relations as something factual and discoverable, and thus variable and uncertain. Likewise, speaking deductively we may permissibly say. \"All unicorns can fly; I have a unicorn named Charlie; Charlie can fly.\" This deductive argument is valid because the logical relations hold; we are not interested in their factual soundness.\n\nInductive reasoning is inherently [[Uncertainty|uncertain]]. It only deals in the extent to which, given the premises, the conclusion is ''credible'' according to some theory of evidence. Examples include a [[many-valued logic]], [[Dempster\u2013Shafer theory]], or [[Probability|probability theory]] with rules for inference such as [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes' rule]]. Unlike deductive reasoning, it does not rely on universals holding over a [[Closed world assumption|closed domain of discourse]] to draw conclusions, so it can be applicable even in cases of [[Open world assumption|epistemic uncertainty]] (technical issues with this may arise however; for example, the [[Axioms of probability#Second axiom|second axiom of probability]] is a closed-world assumption).<ref>{{cite journal |first=Bart |last=Kosko |title=Fuzziness vs. Probability |journal=International Journal of General Systems |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=211\u201340 |year=1990 |doi=10.1080/03081079008935108}}</ref>\n\nAnother crucial difference between these two types of argument is that deductive certainty is impossible in non-axiomatic systems such as [[reality]], leaving inductive reasoning as the primary route to (probabilistic) knowledge of such systems.<ref>{{cite book | chapter-url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-reason/#TheReaReaCogRolLim | title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy : Kant's account of reason | chapter = Kant's Account of Reason | publisher = Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University | year = 2018 }}</ref>\n\nGiven that \"if ''A'' is true then that would cause ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' to be true\", an example of deduction would be \"''A'' is true therefore we can deduce that ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' are true\". An example of induction would be \"''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' are observed to be true therefore ''A'' might be true\". ''A'' is a [[Causality|reasonable]] explanation for ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' being true.\n\nFor example:\n\n:A large enough asteroid impact would create a very large crater and cause a severe [[impact winter]] that could drive the non-avian dinosaurs to extinction.\n:We observe that there is a [[Chicxulub crater|very large crater]] in the Gulf of Mexico dating to very near the time of the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs.\n:Therefore, it is possible that this impact could explain why the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct.\n\nNote, however, that the asteroid explanation for the mass extinction is not necessarily correct. Other events with the potential to affect global climate also coincide with the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs]]. For example, the release of [[volcanic gas]]es (particularly [[sulfur dioxide]]) during the formation of the [[Deccan Traps]] in [[India]].\n\nAnother example of an inductive argument:\n\n:All biological life forms that we know of depend on liquid water to exist.\n:Therefore, if we discover a new biological life form, it will probably depend on liquid water to exist.\n\nThis argument could have been made every time a new biological life form was found, and would have been correct every time; however, it is still possible that in the future a biological life form not requiring liquid water could be discovered.\nAs a result, the argument may be stated less formally as:\n\n:All biological life forms that we know of depend on liquid water to exist.\n:All biological life probably depends on liquid water to exist.\n\nA classical example of an ''incorrect'' inductive argument was presented by John Vickers:\n\n:All of the swans we have seen are white.\n:Therefore, we ''know'' that all swans are white.\n\nThe correct conclusion would be: we [[Expectation (epistemic)|expect]] all swans to be white.\n\nSuccinctly put: deduction is about ''certainty/necessity''; induction is about ''probability''.<ref name=\"Logic. Harry J 2002. p. 268\"/> Any single assertion will answer to one of these two criteria. Another approach to the analysis of reasoning is that of [[modal logic]], which deals with the distinction between the necessary and the  ''possible'' in a way not concerned with probabilities among things deemed possible.\n\nThe philosophical definition of inductive reasoning is more nuanced than a simple progression from particular/individual instances to broader generalizations. Rather, the premises of an inductive [[logical argument]] indicate some degree of support (inductive probability) for the conclusion but do not [[entailment|entail]] it; that is, they suggest truth but do not ensure it. In this manner, there is the possibility of moving from general statements to individual instances (for example, statistical syllogisms, discussed below).\n\nNote that the definition of ''inductive'' reasoning described here differs from [[mathematical induction]], which, in fact, is a form of ''deductive'' reasoning. Mathematical induction is used to provide strict proofs of the properties of recursively defined sets.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chowdhry|first1=K.R.|title=Fundamentals of Discrete Mathematical Structures|date=January 2, 2015|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|page=26|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MmVwBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=%22mathematical+induction%22+deduction#v=onepage&q=%22mathematical%20induction%22%20deduction&f=false|accessdate=1 December 2016|isbn=9788120350748}}</ref> The deductive nature of mathematical induction derives from its basis in a non-finite number of cases, in contrast with the finite number of cases involved in an enumerative induction procedure like [[proof by exhaustion]]. Both mathematical induction and proof by exhaustion are examples of [[complete induction]]. Complete induction is a masked type of deductive reasoning.\n\n==History==\n===Ancient philosophy===\nFor a move from particular to universal, [[Aristotle]] in the 300s BCE used the Greek word ''epagog\u00e9'', which [[Cicero]] translated into the Latin word ''inductio''.<ref name=\"Gattei\">Stefano Gattei, ''Karl Popper's Philosophy of Science: Rationality without Foundations'' (New York: [[Routledge]], 2009), ch. 2 \"Science and philosophy\", [https://books.google.com/books?id=oPPu1JvMBFoC&pg=PA28#v=twopage pp. 28\u201330].</ref>  The ancient [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrhonists]], however, pointed out that induction cannot justify the acceptance of universal statements as true.<ref name=\"Gattei\" />\n\n===Early modern philosophy===\nIn 1620, [[Early modern philosophy|early modern philosopher]] [[Francis Bacon]] repudiated the value of mere experience and enumerative induction alone. His method of [[inductivism]] required that minute and many-varied observations that uncovered the natural world's structure and causal relations needed to be coupled with enumerative induction in order to have knowledge beyond the present scope of experience. Inductivism therefore required enumerative induction as a component.\n\nThe empiricist [[David Hume]]'s 1740 stance found enumerative induction to have no rational, let alone logical, basis but instead induction was a custom of the mind and an everyday requirement to live. While observations, such as the motion of the sun, could be coupled with the principle of the [[Uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]] to produce conclusions that seemed to be certain, the [[problem of induction]] arose from the fact that the uniformity of nature was not a logically valid principle. Hume was sceptical of the application of enumerative induction and reason to reach certainty about unobservables and especially the inference of causality from the fact that modifying an aspect of a relationship prevents or produces a particular outcome.\n\nAwakened from \"dogmatic slumber\" by a German translation of Hume's work, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] sought to explain the possibility of [[metaphysics]].  In 1781, Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' introduced ''[[rationalism]]'' as a path toward knowledge distinct from ''[[empiricism]]''.  Kant sorted statements into two types.  [[analytic-synthetic distinction|Analytic]] statements are true by virtue of the [[syntax|arrangement]] of their terms and [[semantics|meanings]], thus analytic statements are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], merely logical truths, true by [[logical truth|necessity]]. Whereas [[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]] statements hold meanings to refer to states of facts, [[contingency (philosophy)|contingencies]]. Finding it impossible to know objects as they truly are in themselves, however, Kant concluded that the philosopher's task should not be to try to peer behind the veil of appearance to view the ''[[noumena]]'', but simply that of handling ''[[phenomena]]''.\n\nReasoning that the mind must contain its own categories for organizing [[sense data]], making experience of ''space'' and ''time'' possible, Kant concluded that the [[Uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]] was an ''a priori'' truth.<ref name=\"Salmon\" />  A class of synthetic statements that was not [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] but true by necessity, was then [[synthetic a priori|synthetic ''a priori'']].  Kant thus saved both [[metaphysics]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], but as a consequence discarded [[scientific realism]] and developed [[transcendental idealism]].  Kant's transcendental idealism gave birth to the movement of [[German idealism]].  [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s [[absolute idealism]] subsequently flourished across continental Europe.\n\n===Late modern philosophy===\n[[Positivism]], developed by [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and promulgated in the 1830s by his former student [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], was the first [[Late modern philosophy|late modern]] [[philosophy of science]]. In the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], fearing society's ruin, Comte opposed [[metaphysics]]. Human knowledge had evolved from religion to metaphysics to science, said Comte, which had flowed from [[mathematics]] to [[astronomy]] to [[physics]] to [[chemistry]] to [[biology]] to [[sociology]]\u2014in that order\u2014describing increasingly intricate domains. All of society's knowledge had become scientific, with questions of [[theology]] and of [[metaphysics]] being unanswerable. Comte found enumerative induction reliable as a consequence of its grounding in available experience. He asserted the use of science, rather than metaphysical truth, as the correct method for the improvement of human society.\n\nAccording to Comte, [[scientific method]] frames predictions, confirms them, and states laws\u2014positive statements\u2014irrefutable by [[theology]] or by [[metaphysics]].  Regarding experience as justifying enumerative induction by demonstrating the [[Uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]],<ref name=\"Salmon\">Wesley C Salmon, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/210401 \"The uniformity of Nature\"], ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', 1953 Sep;'''14'''(1):39\u201348, [39].</ref> the British philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] welcomed Comte's positivism, but thought [[scientific laws]] susceptible to recall or revision and Mill also withheld from Comte's [[Religion of Humanity]].  Comte was confident in treating [[scientific law]] as an [[foundationalism|irrefutable foundation for all knowledge]], and believed that churches, honouring eminent scientists, ought to focus public mindset on ''[[altruism]]''\u2014a term Comte coined\u2014to apply science for humankind's social welfare via [[sociology]], Comte's leading science.\n\nDuring the 1830s and 1840s, while Comte and Mill were the leading philosophers of science, [[William Whewell]] found enumerative induction not nearly as convincing, and, despite the dominance of inductivism, formulated \"superinduction\".<ref name=\"Toretti-p220\">Roberto Torretti, ''The Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&pg=PA219&dq=Whewell+induction+superinduction 219\u201321][https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&pg=PA216&dq=Comte+Mill &#91;216&#93;].</ref>  Whewell argued that \"the peculiar import of the term ''Induction''\" should be recognised: \"there is some Conception ''superinduced'' upon the facts\", that is, \"the Invention of a new Conception in every inductive inference\". The creation of Conceptions is easily overlooked and prior to Whewell was rarely recognised.<ref name=\"Toretti-p220\" /> Whewell explained:\n\n{{quote|text=\"Although we bind together facts by superinducing upon them a new Conception, this Conception, once introduced and applied, is looked upon as inseparably connected with the facts, and necessarily implied in them.  Having once had the phenomena bound together in their minds in virtue of the Conception, men can no longer easily restore them back to detached and incoherent condition in which they were before they were thus combined.\"<ref name=Toretti-p220/>}}\n\nThese \"superinduced\" explanations may well be flawed, but their accuracy is suggested when they exhibit what Whewell termed ''[[consilience]]''\u2014that is, simultaneously predicting the inductive generalizations in multiple areas\u2014a feat that, according to Whewell, can establish their truth.  Perhaps to accommodate the prevailing view of science as inductivist method, Whewell devoted several chapters to \"methods of induction\" and sometimes used the phrase \"logic of induction\", despite the fact that induction lacks rules and cannot be trained.<ref name=\"Toretti-p220\" />\n\nIn the 1870s, the originator of [[pragmatism]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C S Peirce]] performed vast investigations that clarified the basis of [[deductive inference]] as a mathematical proof (as, independently, did [[Gottlob Frege]]). Peirce recognized induction but always insisted on a third type of inference that Peirce variously termed ''[[abductive reasoning|abduction]]'' or ''retroduction'' or ''hypothesis'' or ''presumption''.<ref>Roberto Torretti, ''The Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&pg=PA226&dq=Peirce+abduction+deduction+induction pp. 226], [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&pg=PA228&dq=Peirce+abduction 228\u201329].</ref>  Later philosophers termed Peirce's abduction, etc., ''[[Inference to the Best Explanation]]'' (IBE).<ref name=\"Poston\" />\n\n===Contemporary philosophy===\n====Bertrand Russell====\nHaving highlighted Hume's [[problem of induction]], [[John Maynard Keynes]] posed ''logical probability'' as its answer, or as near a solution as he could arrive at.<ref>David Andrews, ''Keynes and the British Humanist Tradition: The Moral Purpose of the Market'' (New York: [[Routledge]], 2010), pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1VsYOwRsOVUC&pg=PA63&dq=induction+Hume+Keynes+probability 63\u201365].</ref> [[Bertrand Russell]] found Keynes's ''Treatise on Probability'' the best examination of induction, and believed that if read with Jean Nicod's ''Le Probleme logique de l'induction'' as well as [[R.

The principle of induction, as applied to causation, says that, if ''A'' has been found very often accompanied or followed by ''B'', then it is probable that on the next occasion on which ''A'' is observed, it will be accompanied or followed by ''B''.  If the principle is to be adequate, a sufficient number of instances must make the probability not far short of certainty.  If this principle, or any other from which it can be deduced, is true, then the casual inferences which Hume rejects are valid, not indeed as giving certainty, but as giving a sufficient probability for practical purposes. If this principle is not true, every attempt to arrive at general scientific laws from particular observations is fallacious, and Hume's skepticism is inescapable for an empiricist.  The principle itself cannot, of course, without circularity, be inferred from observed uniformities, since it is required to justify any such inference. It must, therefore, be, or be deduced from, an independent principle not based on experience. To this extent, Hume has proved that pure empiricism is not a sufficient basis for science. But if this one principle is admitted, everything else can proceed in accordance with the theory that all our knowledge is based on experience. It must be granted that this is a serious departure from pure empiricism, and that those who are not empiricists may ask why, if one departure is allowed, others are forbidden. These, however, are not questions directly raised by Hume's arguments. What these arguments prove\u2014and I do not think the proof can be controverted\u2014is that induction is an independent logical principle, incapable of being inferred either from experience or from other logical principles, and that without this principle, science is impossible.\"<ref name=\"Russell1945\">Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'' (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1945 / New York: Simon and Schuster, 1945), pp. 673\u201374.</ref>}}\n\n====Gilbert Harman====\nIn a 1965 paper, [[Gilbert Harman]] explained that enumerative induction is not an autonomous phenomenon, but is simply a disguised consequence of Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE).<ref name=\"Poston\">Ted Poston [http://www.iep.utm.edu/found-ep \"Foundationalism\"], \u00a7 b \"Theories of proper inference\", \u00a7\u00a7 iii \"Liberal inductivism\", ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', 10 Jun 2010 (last updated): \"Strict inductivism is motivated by the thought that we have some kind of inferential knowledge of the world that cannot be accommodated by deductive inference from epistemically [[basic belief]]s.  A fairly recent debate has arisen over the merits of strict inductivism.  Some philosophers have argued that there are other forms of nondeductive inference that do not fit the model of enumerative induction.  [[C.S. Peirce]] describes a form of inference called '[[abductive reasoning|abduction]]' or '[[inference to the best explanation]]'.  This form of inference appeals to explanatory considerations to justify belief.  One infers, for example, that two students copied answers from a third because this is the best explanation of the available data\u2014they each make the same mistakes and the two sat in view of the third.  Alternatively, in a more theoretical context, one infers that there are very small unobservable [[molecules|particles]] because this is the best explanation of [[Brownian motion]].  Let us call 'liberal inductivism' any view that accepts the legitimacy of a form of inference to the best explanation that is distinct from enumerative induction.  For a defense of liberal inductivism, see [[Gilbert Harman]]'s classic (1965) paper.

Recognizing this, Hume highlighted the fact that our mind often draws conclusions from relatively limited experiences that appear correct but which are actually far from certain. In deduction, the truth value of the conclusion is based on the truth of the premise. In induction, however, the dependence of the conclusion on the premise is always uncertain. For example, let us assume that all ravens are black. The fact that there are numerous black ravens supports the assumption. Our assumption, however, becomes invalid once it is discovered that there are white ravens. Therefore, the general rule \"all ravens are black\" is not the kind of statement that can ever be certain. Hume further argued that it is impossible to justify inductive reasoning: this is because it cannot be justified deductively, so our only option is to justify it inductively. Since this argument is circular, with the help of [[Hume's fork]] he concluded that our use of induction is unjustifiable .<ref>Vickers, John.

However, these exceptions are relatively rare.  They occur, for example, in the machine learning programs of [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]]. For the vast bulk of human science both past and present, rules of inductive inference do not exist.  For such science, Popper's model of conjectures which are freely invented and then tested out seems to be more accurate than any model based on inductive inferences. Admittedly, there is talk nowadays in the context of science carried out by humans of 'inference to the best explanation' or 'abductive inference', but such so-called inferences are not at all inferences based on precisely formulated rules like the deductive rules of inference. Those who talk of 'inference to the best explanation' or 'abductive inference', for example, never formulate any precise rules according to which these so-called inferences take place. In reality, the 'inferences' which they describe in their examples involve conjectures thought up by human ingenuity and creativity, and by no means inferred in any mechanical fashion, or according to precisely specified rules\".</ref>{{Failed verification|date=June 2019}}  Popper's stance on induction being an illusion has been falsified: enumerative induction exists. Even so, inductive reasoning is overwhelmingly absent from science.<ref name=\"Gillies-p111\" /> Although much-talked of nowadays by philosophers, abduction, or IBE, lacks [[rules of inference]] and the inferences reached by those employing it are arrived at with human imagination and creativity.<ref name=\"Gillies-p111\" />\n\n===Biases===\nInductive reasoning is also known as hypothesis construction because any conclusions made are based on current knowledge and predictions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} As with deductive arguments, biases can distort the proper application of inductive argument, thereby preventing the reasoner from forming the most [[Logical consequence|logical conclusion]] based on the clues. Examples of these biases include the [[availability heuristic]], [[confirmation bias]], and the  [[Gambler's fallacy|predictable-world bias]].\n\nThe availability heuristic causes the reasoner to depend primarily upon information that is readily available to him or her. People have a tendency to rely on information that is easily accessible in the world around them. For example, in surveys, when people are asked to estimate the percentage of people who died from various causes, most respondents choose the causes that have been most prevalent in the media such as terrorism, murders, and airplane accidents, rather than causes such as disease and traffic accidents, which have been technically \"less accessible\" to the individual since they are not emphasized as heavily in the world around them.\n\nThe confirmation bias is based on the natural tendency to confirm rather than to deny a current hypothesis. Research has demonstrated that people are inclined to seek solutions to problems that are more consistent with known hypotheses rather than attempt to refute those hypotheses. Often, in experiments, subjects will ask questions that seek answers that fit established hypotheses, thus confirming these hypotheses. For example, if it is hypothesized that Sally is a sociable individual, subjects will naturally seek to confirm the premise by asking questions that would produce answers confirming that Sally is, in fact, a sociable individual.\n\nThe predictable-world bias revolves around the inclination to perceive order where it has not been proved to exist, either at all or at a particular level of abstraction. Gambling, for example, is one of the most popular examples of predictable-world bias. Gamblers often begin to think that they see simple and obvious patterns in the outcomes and therefore believe that they are able to predict outcomes based upon what they have witnessed. In reality, however, the outcomes of these games are difficult to predict and highly complex in nature. In general, people tend to seek some type of simplistic order to explain or justify their beliefs and experiences, and it is often difficult for them to realise that their perceptions of order may be entirely different from the truth.<ref>{{cite book|title=Psychology|last=Gray|first=Peter|publisher=Worth|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4292-1947-1|edition=Sixth|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n== Bayesian inference ==\nAs a logic of induction rather than a theory of belief, [[Bayesian inference]] does not determine which beliefs are ''a priori'' rational, but rather determines how we should rationally change the beliefs we have when presented with evidence. We begin by committing to a [[prior probability]] for a hypothesis based on logic or previous experience and, when faced with evidence, we adjust the strength of our belief in that hypothesis in a precise manner using [[conditional probability|Bayesian logic]].\n\n==Inductive inference==\nAround 1960, [[Ray Solomonoff]] founded the theory of universal [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|inductive inference]], a theory of prediction based on observations, for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. This is a formal inductive framework that combines [[algorithmic information theory]] with the Bayesian framework. Universal inductive inference is based on solid philosophical foundations,<ref>{{cite journal |first=Samuel |last=Rathmanner |author2link=Marcus Hutter |first2=Marcus |last2=Hutter |title=A Philosophical Treatise of Universal Induction |journal=Entropy |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=1076\u2013136 |year=2011 |doi=10.3390/e13061076 |bibcode=2011Entrp..13.1076R |arxiv=1105.5721 }}</ref> and can be considered as a mathematically formalized [[Occam's razor]].

About 60% of people are Libertarians.\u201d The argument is weak because the sample is non-random and the sample size is very small.\n\n:So far, this year his son's Little League team has won 6 of ten games.\n:By season\u2019s end, they will have won about 60% of the games.\n\nThis is ''inductive generalization''. This inference is less reliable than the statistical generalization, first, because the sample events are non-random, and secondly because it is not reducible to mathematical expression. Statistically speaking, there is simply no way to know, measure and calculate as to the circumstances affecting performance that will obtain in the future. On a philosophical level, the argument relies on the presupposition that the operation of future events will mirror the past. In other words, it takes for granted a uniformity of nature, an unproven principle that cannot be derived from the empirical data itself. Arguments that tacitly presuppose this uniformity are sometimes called ''Humean'' after the philosopher who was first to subject them to philosophical scrutiny.<ref>Introduction to Logic. Gensler p. 280</ref>\n\n===Statistical syllogism===\n{{Main|Statistical syllogism}}\n\nA statistical syllogism proceeds from a generalization to a conclusion about an individual.\n\n:90% of graduates from Excelsior Preparatory school go on to University.\n:Bob is a graduate of Excelsior Preparatory school.\n:Bob will go on to University.\n\nThis is a ''statistical syllogism''.<ref name=\"Logic. Harry J 2002. p. 268\">Introduction to Logic. Harry J. Gensler, Rutledge, 2002. p. 268</ref> Even though one cannot be sure Bob will attend university, we can be fully assured of the exact probability for this outcome (given no further information). Arguably the argument is too strong and might be accused of \"cheating.\" After all, the probability is given in the premise. Typically, inductive reasoning seeks to ''formulate'' a probability. Two [[dicto simpliciter]] fallacies can occur in statistical syllogisms: \"[[accident (fallacy)|accident]]\" and \"[[converse accident]]\".\n\n===Simple induction===\nSimple induction proceeds from a premise about a sample group to a conclusion about another individual.\n\n: Proportion Q of the known instances of population P has attribute A.\n: Individual I is another member of P.\n: Therefore:\n: There is a probability corresponding to Q that I has A.\n\nThis is a combination of a generalization and a statistical syllogism, where the conclusion of the generalization is also the first premise of the statistical syllogism.\n\n===Enumerative induction===\nThe basic form of [[inductive inference]], simply ''induction'', reasons from particular instances to all instances, and is thus an unrestricted generalization.<ref>{{cite book|title=Logic: An Introduction|last=Churchill|first=Robert Paul|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0-312-02353-9|edition=2nd|location=New York|page=355|oclc=21216829|quote=In a typical enumerative induction, the premises list the individuals observed to have a common property, and the conclusion claims that all individuals of the same population have that property.}}</ref>  If one observes 100 swans, and all 100 were white, one might infer a universal [[categorical proposition]] of the form ''All swans are white''. As this [[argument form|reasoning form]]'s premises, even if true, do not entail the conclusion's truth, this is a form of inductive inference.  The conclusion might be true, and might be thought probably true, yet it can be false. Questions regarding the justification and form of enumerative inductions have been central in [[philosophy of science]], as enumerative induction has a pivotal role in the traditional model of the [[scientific method]].\n\n:All life forms so far discovered are composed of cells.\n:All life forms are composed of cells.\n\nThis is ''enumerative induction'', aka ''simple induction'' or ''simple predictive induction''. It is a subcategory of inductive generalization. In everyday practice, this is perhaps the most common form of induction. For the preceding argument, the conclusion is tempting but makes a prediction well in excess of the evidence. First, it assumes that life forms observed until now can tell us how future cases will be: an appeal to uniformity. Second, the concluding ''All'' is a very bold assertion. A single contrary instance foils the argument. And last, to quantify the level of probability in any mathematical form is problematic.<ref>Schaum\u2019s Outlines, Logic, pp. 243\u201335</ref> By what standard do we measure our Earthly sample of known life against all (possible) life? For suppose we do discover some new organism\u2014let's say some microorganism floating in the mesosphere, or better yet, on some asteroid\u2014and it is cellular. Doesn't the addition of this corroborating evidence oblige us to raise our probability assessment for the subject proposition? It is generally deemed reasonable to answer this question \"yes,\" and for a good many this \"yes\" is not only reasonable but incontrovertible. So then just ''how much'' should this new data change our probability assessment? Here, consensus melts away, and in its place arises a question about whether we can talk of probability coherently at all without numerical quantification.\n\n:All life forms so far discovered have been composed of cells.\n:The ''next'' life form discovered will be composed of cells.\n\nThis is enumerative induction in its ''weak form''. It truncates \"all\" to a mere single instance and, by making a far weaker claim, considerably strengthens the probability of its conclusion. Otherwise, it has the same shortcomings as the strong form: its sample population is non-random, and quantification methods are elusive.\n\n===Argument from analogy===\n{{Main|Argument from analogy}}\n\nThe process of analogical inference involves noting the shared properties of two or more things and from this basis inferring that they also share some further property:<ref name=\"Baronett\">{{Cite book|title=Logic|last=Baronett|first=Stan|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2008|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages=321\u201325}}</ref>\n\n:P and Q are similar in respect to properties a, b, and c.\n:Object P has been observed to have further property x.\n:Therefore, Q probably has property x also.\n\nAnalogical reasoning is very frequent in [[common sense]], [[science]], [[philosophy]] and the [[humanities]], but sometimes it is accepted only as an auxiliary method. A refined approach is [[case-based reasoning]].<ref>For more information on inferences by analogy, see [http://www.cs.hut.fi/Opinnot/T-93.850/2005/Papers/juthe2005-analogy.pdf Juthe, 2005].</ref>\n\n:Mineral A is an igneous rock often containing veins of quartz and most commonly found in South America in areas of ancient volcanic activity.\n:Additionally, mineral A is a soft stone suitable for carving into jewelry.\n:Mineral B is an igneous rock often containing veins of quartz and most commonly found in South America in areas of ancient volcanic activity.                                                \n:Mineral B is probably a soft stone suitable for carving into jewelry.\n\nThis is ''analogical induction'', according to which things alike in certain ways are more prone to be alike in other ways. This form of induction was explored in detail by philosopher John Stuart Mill in his ''System of Logic'', wherein he states:\n\n:\"There can be no doubt that every resemblance [not known to be irrelevant] affords some degree of probability, beyond what\n:would otherwise exist, in favour of the conclusion.\"<ref>A System of Logic. Mill 1843/1930. p. 333</ref>\n\nAnalogical induction is a subcategory of inductive generalization because it assumes a pre-established uniformity governing events. Analogical induction requires an auxiliary examination of the ''relevancy'' of the characteristics cited as common to the pair. In the preceding example, if I add the premise that both stones were mentioned in the records of early Spanish explorers, this common attribute is extraneous to the stones and does not contribute to their probable affinity.\n\nA pitfall of analogy is that features can be cherry-picked: while objects may show striking similarities, two things juxtaposed may respectively possess other characteristics not identified in the analogy that are characteristics sharply ''dis''similar. Thus, analogy can mislead if not all relevant comparisons are made.\n\n===Causal inference===\nA causal inference draws a conclusion about a causal connection based on the conditions of the occurrence of an effect. Premises about the correlation of two things can indicate a causal relationship between them, but additional factors must be confirmed to establish the exact form of the causal relationship.\n\n===Prediction===\nA prediction draws a conclusion about a future individual from a past sample.\n\n: Proportion Q of observed members of group G have had attribute A.\n: Therefore:\n: There is a probability corresponding to Q that other members of group G will have attribute A when next observed.\n\n==Comparison with deductive reasoning==\n[[File:Argument terminology used in logic (en).svg|thumb|400px|Argument terminology]]\nInductive reasoning is a form of argument that\u2014in contrast to deductive reasoning\u2014allows for the possibility that a conclusion can be false, even if all of the [[premise]]s are true.<ref>John Vickers. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/ The Problem of Induction]. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</ref> Instead of being valid or invalid, inductive arguments are either ''strong'' or ''weak'', according to how ''probable'' it is that the conclusion is true.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~bio125/logic.Giere.pdf | title = Logical Basis of Hypothesis Testing in Scientific Research | last = Herms | first = D. }}</ref> We may call an inductive argument plausible, probable, reasonable, justified or strong, but never certain or necessary. Logic affords no bridge from the probable to the certain.\n\nThe futility of attaining certainty through some critical mass of probability can be illustrated with a coin-toss exercise. Suppose someone shows us a coin and tests to see if the coin is either a fair one or two-headed. They flip the coin ten times, and ten times it comes up heads. At this point, there is a strong reason to believe it is two-headed. After all, the chance of ten heads in a row is .000976: less than one in one thousand. Then, after 100 flips, every toss has come up heads. Now there is \u201cvirtual\u201d certainty that the coin is two-headed. Still, one can neither logically nor empirically rule out that the next toss will produce tails. No matter how many times in a row it comes up heads this remains the case. If one programmed a machine to flip a coin over and over continuously at some point the result would be a string of 100 heads. In the fullness of time, all combinations will appear.\n\nAs for the slim prospect of getting ten out of ten heads from a fair coin\u2014the outcome that made the coin appear biased\u2014many may be surprised to learn that the chance of any sequence of heads or tails is equally unlikely (e.g. H-H-T-T-H-T-H-H-H-T) and yet it occurs in ''every'' trial of ten tosses. That means ''all'' results for ten tosses have the same probability as getting ten out of ten heads, which is 0.000976. If one records the heads-tails sequences, for whatever result, that exact sequence had a chance of 0.000976.\n\nAn argument is deductive when the conclusion is necessary given the premises. That is, the conclusion cannot be false if the premises are true.\n\nIf a deductive conclusion follows duly from its premises, then it is valid; otherwise, it is invalid (that an argument is invalid is not to say it is false. It may have a true conclusion, just not on account of the premises). An examination of the following examples will show that the relationship between premises and conclusion is such that the truth of the conclusion is already implicit in the premises. Bachelors are unmarried because we ''say'' they are; we have defined them so. Socrates is mortal because we have included him in a set of beings that are mortal. The conclusion for a valid deductive argument is already contained in the premises since its truth is strictly a matter of logical relations. It cannot say more than its premises. Inductive premises, on the other hand, draw their substance from fact and evidence, and the conclusion accordingly makes a factual claim or prediction. Its reliability varies proportionally with the evidence. Induction wants to reveal something ''new'' about the world. One could say that induction wants to say ''more'' than is contained in the premises.\n\nTo better see the difference between inductive and deductive arguments, consider that it would not make sense to say: \"all rectangles so far examined have four right angles, so the next one I see will have four right angles.\" This would treat logical relations as something factual and discoverable, and thus variable and uncertain. Likewise, speaking deductively we may permissibly say. \"All unicorns can fly; I have a unicorn named Charlie; Charlie can fly.\" This deductive argument is valid because the logical relations hold; we are not interested in their factual soundness.\n\nInductive reasoning is inherently [[Uncertainty|uncertain]]. It only deals in the extent to which, given the premises, the conclusion is ''credible'' according to some theory of evidence. Examples include a [[many-valued logic]], [[Dempster\u2013Shafer theory]], or [[Probability|probability theory]] with rules for inference such as [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes' rule]]. Unlike deductive reasoning, it does not rely on universals holding over a [[Closed world assumption|closed domain of discourse]] to draw conclusions, so it can be applicable even in cases of [[Open world assumption|epistemic uncertainty]] (technical issues with this may arise however; for example, the [[Axioms of probability#Second axiom|second axiom of probability]] is a closed-world assumption).<ref>{{cite journal |first=Bart |last=Kosko |title=Fuzziness vs. Probability |journal=International Journal of General Systems |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=211\u201340 |year=1990 |doi=10.1080/03081079008935108}}</ref>\n\nAnother crucial difference between these two types of argument is that deductive certainty is impossible in non-axiomatic systems such as [[reality]], leaving inductive reasoning as the primary route to (probabilistic) knowledge of such systems.<ref>{{cite book | chapter-url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-reason/#TheReaReaCogRolLim | title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy : Kant's account of reason | chapter = Kant's Account of Reason | publisher = Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University | year = 2018 }}</ref>\n\nGiven that \"if ''A'' is true then that would cause ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' to be true\", an example of deduction would be \"''A'' is true therefore we can deduce that ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' are true\". An example of induction would be \"''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' are observed to be true therefore ''A'' might be true\". ''A'' is a [[Causality|reasonable]] explanation for ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' being true.\n\nFor example:\n\n:A large enough asteroid impact would create a very large crater and cause a severe [[impact winter]] that could drive the non-avian dinosaurs to extinction.\n:We observe that there is a [[Chicxulub crater|very large crater]] in the Gulf of Mexico dating to very near the time of the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs.\n:Therefore, it is possible that this impact could explain why the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct.\n\nNote, however, that the asteroid explanation for the mass extinction is not necessarily correct. Other events with the potential to affect global climate also coincide with the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs]]. For example, the release of [[volcanic gas]]es (particularly [[sulfur dioxide]]) during the formation of the [[Deccan Traps]] in [[India]].\n\nAnother example of an inductive argument:\n\n:All biological life forms that we know of depend on liquid water to exist.\n:Therefore, if we discover a new biological life form, it will probably depend on liquid water to exist.\n\nThis argument could have been made every time a new biological life form was found, and would have been correct every time; however, it is still possible that in the future a biological life form not requiring liquid water could be discovered.\nAs a result, the argument may be stated less formally as:\n\n:All biological life forms that we know of depend on liquid water to exist.\n:All biological life probably depends on liquid water to exist.\n\nA classical example of an ''incorrect'' inductive argument was presented by John Vickers:\n\n:All of the swans we have seen are white.\n:Therefore, we ''know'' that all swans are white.\n\nThe correct conclusion would be: we [[Expectation (epistemic)|expect]] all swans to be white.\n\nSuccinctly put: deduction is about ''certainty/necessity''; induction is about ''probability''.<ref name=\"Logic. Harry J 2002. p. 268\"/> Any single assertion will answer to one of these two criteria. Another approach to the analysis of reasoning is that of [[modal logic]], which deals with the distinction between the necessary and the  ''possible'' in a way not concerned with probabilities among things deemed possible.\n\nThe philosophical definition of inductive reasoning is more nuanced than a simple progression from particular/individual instances to broader generalizations. Rather, the premises of an inductive [[logical argument]] indicate some degree of support (inductive probability) for the conclusion but do not [[entailment|entail]] it; that is, they suggest truth but do not ensure it. In this manner, there is the possibility of moving from general statements to individual instances (for example, statistical syllogisms, discussed below).\n\nNote that the definition of ''inductive'' reasoning described here differs from [[mathematical induction]], which, in fact, is a form of ''deductive'' reasoning. Mathematical induction is used to provide strict proofs of the properties of recursively defined sets.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chowdhry|first1=K.R.|title=Fundamentals of Discrete Mathematical Structures|date=January 2, 2015|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

Both mathematical induction and proof by exhaustion are examples of [[complete induction]]. Complete induction is a masked type of deductive reasoning.\n\n==History==\n===Ancient philosophy===\nFor a move from particular to universal, [[Aristotle]] in the 300s BCE used the Greek word ''epagog\u00e9'', which [[Cicero]] translated into the Latin word ''inductio''.<ref name=\"Gattei\">Stefano Gattei, ''Karl Popper's Philosophy of Science: Rationality without Foundations'' (New York: [[Routledge]], 2009), ch. 2 \"Science and philosophy\", [https://books.google.com/books?id=oPPu1JvMBFoC&pg=PA28#v=twopage pp. 28\u201330].</ref>  The ancient [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrhonists]], however, pointed out that induction cannot justify the acceptance of universal statements as true.<ref name=\"Gattei\" />\n\n===Early modern philosophy===\nIn 1620, [[Early modern philosophy|early modern philosopher]] [[Francis Bacon]] repudiated the value of mere experience and enumerative induction alone. His method of [[inductivism]] required that minute and many-varied observations that uncovered the natural world's structure and causal relations needed to be coupled with enumerative induction in order to have knowledge beyond the present scope of experience. Inductivism therefore required enumerative induction as a component.\n\nThe empiricist [[David Hume]]'s 1740 stance found enumerative induction to have no rational, let alone logical, basis but instead induction was a custom of the mind and an everyday requirement to live. While observations, such as the motion of the sun, could be coupled with the principle of the [[Uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]] to produce conclusions that seemed to be certain, the [[problem of induction]] arose from the fact that the uniformity of nature was not a logically valid principle. Hume was sceptical of the application of enumerative induction and reason to reach certainty about unobservables and especially the inference of causality from the fact that modifying an aspect of a relationship prevents or produces a particular outcome.\n\nAwakened from \"dogmatic slumber\" by a German translation of Hume's work, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] sought to explain the possibility of [[metaphysics]].  In 1781, Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' introduced ''[[rationalism]]'' as a path toward knowledge distinct from ''[[empiricism]]''.  Kant sorted statements into two types.  [[analytic-synthetic distinction|Analytic]] statements are true by virtue of the [[syntax|arrangement]] of their terms and [[semantics|meanings]], thus analytic statements are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], merely logical truths, true by [[logical truth|necessity]]. Whereas [[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]] statements hold meanings to refer to states of facts, [[contingency (philosophy)|contingencies]]. Finding it impossible to know objects as they truly are in themselves, however, Kant concluded that the philosopher's task should not be to try to peer behind the veil of appearance to view the ''[[noumena]]'', but simply that of handling ''[[phenomena]]''.\n\nReasoning that the mind must contain its own categories for organizing [[sense data]], making experience of ''space'' and ''time'' possible, Kant concluded that the [[Uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]] was an ''a priori'' truth.<ref name=\"Salmon\" />  A class of synthetic statements that was not [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] but true by necessity, was then [[synthetic a priori|synthetic ''a priori'']].  Kant thus saved both [[metaphysics]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], but as a consequence discarded [[scientific realism]] and developed [[transcendental idealism]].  Kant's transcendental idealism gave birth to the movement of [[German idealism]].  [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s [[absolute idealism]] subsequently flourished across continental Europe.\n\n===Late modern philosophy===\n[[Positivism]], developed by [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and promulgated in the 1830s by his former student [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], was the first [[Late modern philosophy|late modern]] [[philosophy of science]]. In the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], fearing society's ruin, Comte opposed [[metaphysics]]. Human knowledge had evolved from religion to metaphysics to science, said Comte, which had flowed from [[mathematics]] to [[astronomy]] to [[physics]] to [[chemistry]] to [[biology]] to [[sociology]]\u2014in that order\u2014describing increasingly intricate domains. All of society's knowledge had become scientific, with questions of [[theology]] and of [[metaphysics]] being unanswerable. Comte found enumerative induction reliable as a consequence of its grounding in available experience. He asserted the use of science, rather than metaphysical truth, as the correct method for the improvement of human society.\n\nAccording to Comte, [[scientific method]] frames predictions, confirms them, and states laws\u2014positive statements\u2014irrefutable by [[theology]] or by [[metaphysics]].  Regarding experience as justifying enumerative induction by demonstrating the [[Uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]],<ref name=\"Salmon\">Wesley C Salmon, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/210401 \"The uniformity of Nature\"], ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', 1953 Sep;'''14'''(1):39\u201348, [39].</ref> the British philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] welcomed Comte's positivism, but thought [[scientific laws]] susceptible to recall or revision and Mill also withheld from Comte's [[Religion of Humanity]].  Comte was confident in treating [[scientific law]] as an [[foundationalism|irrefutable foundation for all knowledge]], and believed that churches, honouring eminent scientists, ought to focus public mindset on ''[[altruism]]''\u2014a term Comte coined\u2014to apply science for humankind's social welfare via [[sociology]], Comte's leading science.\n\nDuring the 1830s and 1840s, while Comte and Mill were the leading philosophers of science, [[William Whewell]] found enumerative induction not nearly as convincing, and, despite the dominance of inductivism, formulated \"superinduction\".<ref name=\"Toretti-p220\">Roberto Torretti, ''The Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&pg=PA219&dq=Whewell+induction+superinduction 219\u201321][https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&pg=PA216&dq=Comte+Mill &#91;216&#93;].</ref>  Whewell argued that \"the peculiar import of the term ''Induction''\" should be recognised: \"there is some Conception ''superinduced'' upon the facts\", that is, \"the Invention of a new Conception in every inductive inference\". The creation of Conceptions is easily overlooked and prior to Whewell was rarely recognised.<ref name=\"Toretti-p220\" /> Whewell explained:\n\n{{quote|text=\"Although we bind together facts by superinducing upon them a new Conception, this Conception, once introduced and applied, is looked upon as inseparably connected with the facts, and necessarily implied in them.  Having once had the phenomena bound together in their minds in virtue of the Conception, men can no longer easily restore them back to detached and incoherent condition in which they were before they were thus combined.\"<ref name=Toretti-p220/>}}\n\nThese \"superinduced\" explanations may well be flawed, but their accuracy is suggested when they exhibit what Whewell termed ''[[consilience]]''\u2014that is, simultaneously predicting the inductive generalizations in multiple areas\u2014a feat that, according to Whewell, can establish their truth.  Perhaps to accommodate the prevailing view of science as inductivist method, Whewell devoted several chapters to \"methods of induction\" and sometimes used the phrase \"logic of induction\", despite the fact that induction lacks rules and cannot be trained.<ref name=\"Toretti-p220\" />\n\nIn the 1870s, the originator of [[pragmatism]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C S Peirce]] performed vast investigations that clarified the basis of [[deductive inference]] as a mathematical proof (as, independently, did [[Gottlob Frege]]). Peirce recognized induction but always insisted on a third type of inference that Peirce variously termed ''[[abductive reasoning|abduction]]'' or ''retroduction'' or ''hypothesis'' or ''presumption''.<ref>Roberto Torretti, ''The Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&pg=PA226&dq=Peirce+abduction+deduction+induction pp. 226], [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&pg=PA228&dq=Peirce+abduction 228\u201329].</ref>  Later philosophers termed Peirce's abduction, etc., ''[[Inference to the Best Explanation]]'' (IBE).<ref name=\"Poston\" />\n\n===Contemporary philosophy===\n====Bertrand Russell====\nHaving highlighted Hume's [[problem of induction]], [[John Maynard Keynes]] posed ''logical probability'' as its answer, or as near a solution as he could arrive at.<ref>David Andrews, ''Keynes and the British Humanist Tradition: The Moral Purpose of the Market'' (New York: [[Routledge]], 2010), pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1VsYOwRsOVUC&pg=PA63&dq=induction+Hume+Keynes+probability 63\u201365].</ref> [[Bertrand Russell]] found Keynes's ''Treatise on Probability'' the best examination of induction, and believed that if read with Jean Nicod's ''Le Probleme logique de l'induction'' as well as [[R.

The principle of induction, as applied to causation, says that, if ''A'' has been found very often accompanied or followed by ''B'', then it is probable that on the next occasion on which ''A'' is observed, it will be accompanied or followed by ''B''.  If the principle is to be adequate, a sufficient number of instances must make the probability not far short of certainty.  If this principle, or any other from which it can be deduced, is true, then the casual inferences which Hume rejects are valid, not indeed as giving certainty, but as giving a sufficient probability for practical purposes. If this principle is not true, every attempt to arrive at general scientific laws from particular observations is fallacious, and Hume's skepticism is inescapable for an empiricist.  The principle itself cannot, of course, without circularity, be inferred from observed uniformities, since it is required to justify any such inference. It must, therefore, be, or be deduced from, an independent principle not based on experience. To this extent, Hume has proved that pure empiricism is not a sufficient basis for science. But if this one principle is admitted, everything else can proceed in accordance with the theory that all our knowledge is based on experience. It must be granted that this is a serious departure from pure empiricism, and that those who are not empiricists may ask why, if one departure is allowed, others are forbidden. These, however, are not questions directly raised by Hume's arguments. What these arguments prove\u2014and I do not think the proof can be controverted\u2014is that induction is an independent logical principle, incapable of being inferred either from experience or from other logical principles, and that without this principle, science is impossible.\"<ref name=\"Russell1945\">Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'' (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1945 / New York: Simon and Schuster, 1945), pp. 673\u201374.</ref>}}\n\n====Gilbert Harman====\nIn a 1965 paper, [[Gilbert Harman]] explained that enumerative induction is not an autonomous phenomenon, but is simply a disguised consequence of Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE).<ref name=\"Poston\">Ted Poston [http://www.iep.utm.edu/found-ep \"Foundationalism\"], \u00a7 b \"Theories of proper inference\", \u00a7\u00a7 iii \"Liberal inductivism\", ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', 10 Jun 2010 (last updated): \"Strict inductivism is motivated by the thought that we have some kind of inferential knowledge of the world that cannot be accommodated by deductive inference from epistemically [[basic belief]]s.  A fairly recent debate has arisen over the merits of strict inductivism.  Some philosophers have argued that there are other forms of nondeductive inference that do not fit the model of enumerative induction.  [[C.S. Peirce]] describes a form of inference called '[[abductive reasoning|abduction]]' or '[[inference to the best explanation]]'.  This form of inference appeals to explanatory considerations to justify belief.  One infers, for example, that two students copied answers from a third because this is the best explanation of the available data\u2014they each make the same mistakes and the two sat in view of the third.  Alternatively, in a more theoretical context, one infers that there are very small unobservable [[molecules|particles]] because this is the best explanation of [[Brownian motion]].  Let us call 'liberal inductivism' any view that accepts the legitimacy of a form of inference to the best explanation that is distinct from enumerative induction.  For a defense of liberal inductivism, see [[Gilbert Harman]]'s classic (1965) paper.

Recognizing this, Hume highlighted the fact that our mind often draws conclusions from relatively limited experiences that appear correct but which are actually far from certain. In deduction, the truth value of the conclusion is based on the truth of the premise. In induction, however, the dependence of the conclusion on the premise is always uncertain. For example, let us assume that all ravens are black. The fact that there are numerous black ravens supports the assumption. Our assumption, however, becomes invalid once it is discovered that there are white ravens. Therefore, the general rule \"all ravens are black\" is not the kind of statement that can ever be certain. Hume further argued that it is impossible to justify inductive reasoning: this is because it cannot be justified deductively, so our only option is to justify it inductively. Since this argument is circular, with the help of [[Hume's fork]] he concluded that our use of induction is unjustifiable .<ref>Vickers, John. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/#2HumIndJus \"The Problem of Induction\"] (Section 2). ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. 21 June 2010</ref>\n\nHume nevertheless stated that even if induction were proved unreliable, we would still have to rely on it. So instead of a position of [[Philosophical skepticism|severe skepticism]], Hume advocated a [[Scientific skepticism|practical skepticism]] based on [[common sense]], where the inevitability of induction is accepted.<ref>Vickers, John.

However, these exceptions are relatively rare.  They occur, for example, in the machine learning programs of [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]]. For the vast bulk of human science both past and present, rules of inductive inference do not exist.  For such science, Popper's model of conjectures which are freely invented and then tested out seems to be more accurate than any model based on inductive inferences. Admittedly, there is talk nowadays in the context of science carried out by humans of 'inference to the best explanation' or 'abductive inference', but such so-called inferences are not at all inferences based on precisely formulated rules like the deductive rules of inference. Those who talk of 'inference to the best explanation' or 'abductive inference', for example, never formulate any precise rules according to which these so-called inferences take place. In reality, the 'inferences' which they describe in their examples involve conjectures thought up by human ingenuity and creativity, and by no means inferred in any mechanical fashion, or according to precisely specified rules\".</ref>{{Failed verification|date=June 2019}}  Popper's stance on induction being an illusion has been falsified: enumerative induction exists. Even so, inductive reasoning is overwhelmingly absent from science.<ref name=\"Gillies-p111\" /> Although much-talked of nowadays by philosophers, abduction, or IBE, lacks [[rules of inference]] and the inferences reached by those employing it are arrived at with human imagination and creativity.<ref name=\"Gillies-p111\" />\n\n===Biases===\nInductive reasoning is also known as hypothesis construction because any conclusions made are based on current knowledge and predictions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} As with deductive arguments, biases can distort the proper application of inductive argument, thereby preventing the reasoner from forming the most [[Logical consequence|logical conclusion]] based on the clues. Examples of these biases include the [[availability heuristic]], [[confirmation bias]], and the  [[Gambler's fallacy|predictable-world bias]].\n\nThe availability heuristic causes the reasoner to depend primarily upon information that is readily available to him or her. People have a tendency to rely on information that is easily accessible in the world around them. For example, in surveys, when people are asked to estimate the percentage of people who died from various causes, most respondents choose the causes that have been most prevalent in the media such as terrorism, murders, and airplane accidents, rather than causes such as disease and traffic accidents, which have been technically \"less accessible\" to the individual since they are not emphasized as heavily in the world around them.\n\nThe confirmation bias is based on the natural tendency to confirm rather than to deny a current hypothesis. Research has demonstrated that people are inclined to seek solutions to problems that are more consistent with known hypotheses rather than attempt to refute those hypotheses. Often, in experiments, subjects will ask questions that seek answers that fit established hypotheses, thus confirming these hypotheses. For example, if it is hypothesized that Sally is a sociable individual, subjects will naturally seek to confirm the premise by asking questions that would produce answers confirming that Sally is, in fact, a sociable individual.\n\nThe predictable-world bias revolves around the inclination to perceive order where it has not been proved to exist, either at all or at a particular level of abstraction. Gambling, for example, is one of the most popular examples of predictable-world bias. Gamblers often begin to think that they see simple and obvious patterns in the outcomes and therefore believe that they are able to predict outcomes based upon what they have witnessed. In reality, however, the outcomes of these games are difficult to predict and highly complex in nature. In general, people tend to seek some type of simplistic order to explain or justify their beliefs and experiences, and it is often difficult for them to realise that their perceptions of order may be entirely different from the truth.<ref>{{cite book|title=Psychology|last=Gray|first=Peter|publisher=Worth|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4292-1947-1|edition=Sixth|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n== Bayesian inference ==\nAs a logic of induction rather than a theory of belief, [[Bayesian inference]] does not determine which beliefs are ''a priori'' rational, but rather determines how we should rationally change the beliefs we have when presented with evidence. We begin by committing to a [[prior probability]] for a hypothesis based on logic or previous experience and, when faced with evidence, we adjust the strength of our belief in that hypothesis in a precise manner using [[conditional probability|Bayesian logic]].\n\n==Inductive inference==\nAround 1960, [[Ray Solomonoff]] founded the theory of universal [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|inductive inference]], a theory of prediction based on observations, for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. This is a formal inductive framework that combines [[algorithmic information theory]] with the Bayesian framework. Universal inductive inference is based on solid philosophical foundations,<ref>{{cite journal |first=Samuel |last=Rathmanner |author2link=Marcus Hutter |first2=Marcus |last2=Hutter |title=A Philosophical Treatise of Universal Induction |journal=Entropy |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=1076\u2013136 |year=2011 |doi=10.3390/e13061076 |bibcode=2011Entrp..13.1076R |arxiv=1105.5721 }}</ref> and can be considered as a mathematically formalized [[Occam's razor]].

The Native Americans' ancestors had been there for more than 10,000 years as evidenced by the discovery of the remains of prehistoric [[Leanderthal Lady]]. During the period of recorded history from A.D. 1519 to 1848, all or parts of Texas were claimed by five countries: [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Mexico]], the [[Republic of Texas]], and the [[United States of America]] as well as the [[Confederate States of America|confederacy]] during [[American Civil War|the civil war]].\n\nThe first [[Europe]]an base was established in 1680, along the upper [[Rio Grande]] river, near modern   [[El Paso]], [[Texas]] with the exiled Spaniards and Native Americans from the [[Isleta]] Pueblo during the [[Pueblo Revolt]], also known as [[Pop\u00e9's Rebellion]], from  today's northern [[New Mexico]]. In 1682, [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] (1643-1687),  established a  [[French colonization of Texas|French colony]] at [[Fort Saint Louis (Texas)|Fort Saint Louis]], after sailing down and exploring the [[Mississippi River]] from [[New France]]  (modern [[Canada]]) and the [[Great Lakes]]. He planted this  early French presence at [[Fort Saint Louis (Texas)|Fort Saint Louis]]  near [[Matagorda Bay]], along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast (near modern [[Inez, Texas]]), even before the establishment of [[New Orleans]] on the lower [[Mississippi River]]. The colony was killed off by Native Americans after three years, but Spanish authorities felt pressed to establish settlements to keep their claim to the land. Several [[Spanish missions in Texas|Roman Catholic missions]] were established in [[East Texas]]; they were abandoned in 1691. Twenty years later, concerned with the continued French presence in neighboring [[Louisiana]], Spanish authorities again tried to colonize Texas. Over the next 110 years, Spain established numerous villages, ''[[presidio]]s'', and missions in the province. A small number of Spanish settlers arrived, in addition to missionaries and soldiers. Spain signed agreements with colonizers from the [[United States]], bordering the province to the northeast ever since their [[Louisiana Purchase]] from the Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon I]] and his [[First French Empire|French Empire]] ([[France]]) in 1803. When Mexico won its [[Mexican War of Independence|independence from Spain in 1821]], [[Mexican Texas]] was part of the new nation. To encourage settlement, Mexican authorities allowed organized immigration from the United States, and by 1834, over 30,000&nbsp;Anglos lived in Texas,<ref name=manchaca201>{{citation |last=Manchaca |first=Martha |title=Recovering History, Constructing Race: The Indian, Black, and White Roots of Mexican Americans|series=The Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long Series in Latin American and Latino Art and Culture|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|location=Austin |year=2001 |p=201 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFn5bnx2OBcC |isbn=978-0-292-75253-5}}</ref> compared to 7,800&nbsp;Mexicans.<ref name=manchaca172>{{harvp|Manchaca|2001|p=172}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]]'s dissolution of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]] and his political shift to the right, issues such as lack of access to courts, the militarization of the region's government (e.g., response to Saltillo-Monclova problem), and self-defense issues resulting in the confrontation in Gonzales, public sentiment in Mexican and Anglo Texans turned towards revolution. Santa Anna's invasion of the territory after putting down the rebellion in [[Zacatecas]] provoked the conflict of 1836. The [[Texian Army|Texian forces]] fought and won the [[Texas Revolution]] in 1835\u20131836.\n\nAlthough not recognized as such by Mexico, Texas declared itself an independent nation, the [[Republic of Texas]]. Attracted by the rich lands for cotton plantations and ranching, tens of thousands of immigrants arrived from the U.S. and from [[Germany]] as well. In 1845, Texas [[Texas Annexation|joined the United States]], becoming the 28th state, when the United States annexed it. Only after the conclusion of the Mexican\u2013American War, with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848, did Mexico recognize Texan independence. Texas declared its secession from the United States in 1861 to join the Confederate States of America. Only a few battles of the [[American Civil War]] were fought in Texas; most Texas regiments served in the east. When the war ended, the enslaved African Americans were freed. Texas was subject to [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], a process that left a residue of bitterness among whites. They regained political dominance and passed laws in the late 19th century creating second-class status for blacks in a [[Jim Crow]] system of segregation and disenfranchising them in 1901 through passage of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]]. Blacks were excluded from the formal political system until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.\n\nCotton, ranching, and farming dominated the economy, with [[railroad]] construction after 1870 a major factor in the development of new cities away from rivers and waterways. Toward the end of the 19th century, timber became an important industry in Texas as well. In 1901 a [[petroleum]] discovery at [[Spindletop|Spindletop Hill]], near Beaumont, was developed as the most productive oil well the world had ever seen. The wave of oil speculation and discovery that followed came to be known as the \"[[Texas Oil Boom|Oil Boom]]\", permanently transforming and enriching the economy of Texas. Agriculture and ranching gave way to a service-oriented society after the boom years of World War II. Segregation ended in the 1960s due to federal legislation. Politically, Texas changed from the virtually one-party Democratic state achieved following disenfranchisement, to a highly contested political scene, until 2000 when it was solidly Republican. The economy of Texas has continued to grow rapidly, becoming the second-largest state in population in 1994, and became economically highly diversified, with a growing base in new technology.\n\n=={{visible anchor|Pre-Columbian history|Indigenous peoples}}==\n{{Further information|Pre-Columbian Mexico}}\nTexas lies at the juncture of two major cultural spheres of [[Pre-Columbian North America]], the [[Southwestern tribes|Southwestern]] and the [[Plains Indians|Plains]] areas.

Upon contact with Europeans, they formed four collective confederacies known as the [[Natchitoches people|Natchitoches]], the [[Hasinai]], the [[Wichita people|Wichita]] & the [[Caddo|Kadohadocho]] (Caddo).

The Coahuiltecans, at some point, would have migrated south to merge with their sister tribes. In the 18th century, the Creek Confederacy formed on the east coast, forcing several smaller Muskogean peoples out of the state. They may have migrated to Texas & Mexico, where they were absorbed into other tribes. The Choctaw also split and one of their four subtribes, the [[Houma people|Houma]] came to reside in the eastern region the state before returning to Louisiana.\n\nAfter the American Revolution, many tribes were being consistently moved to migrate further west and give up their lands to American citizens. This may have been due to the unusual circumstance that the United States still considered many of these tribes as foreign nations, but outwardly claimed the land they stood on. That being said, the main push was for new, rich farmland as the plantation-style farming on the east coast soon damaged the native soil. Many tribes in the early 19th century became fed up with these practices, choosing to migrate to Texas, which was still a part of New Spain at the time. These tribes include the [[Mingo | Mingo Seneca]], the [[Lenape]],<ref>Carol A. Lipscomb, \"DELAWARE INDIANS\", Handbook of Texas Online, accessed July 8, 2012.

The present-day outlines of the U.S. states (white lines) are superimposed on the boundaries of 1836\u20131845.]]\n\nThe [[1st Congress of the Republic of Texas]] convened in October 1836 at [[Columbia, Texas|Columbia]] (now [[West Columbia, Texas|West Columbia]]). It overturned the Mexican prohibition of slavery, although it allowed slaveholders to free their slaves if they desired. [[Stephen Fuller Austin|Stephen F. Austin]], known as the [[List of people known as the father or mother of something|''Father of Texas'']], died December 27, 1836, after serving two months as [[Secretary of State]] for the new Republic. In 1836, five sites served as temporary capitals of Texas ([[Washington-on-the-Brazos]], [[Harrisburg, Texas|Harrisburg]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Velasco, Texas|Velasco]] and [[Columbia, Texas|Columbia]]) before [[President of the Republic of Texas|President]] [[Sam Houston]] moved the capital to [[Houston]] in 1837. In 1839, the capital was moved to the new town of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] by the next president, [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]].\n\nInternal politics of the Republic were based on the conflict between two factions. The nationalist faction, led by [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], advocated the continued independence of Texas, the expulsion of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and the expansion of Texas to the Pacific Ocean. Their opponents, led by Sam Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful co-existence with Native Americans.\n\nAlthough Texas governed itself, Mexico refused to recognize its independence.<ref name=vazquez76>{{harvp|Vazquez|1997|p=76}}</ref> On March 5, 1842, a Mexican force of over 500 men, led by [[R\u00e1fael V\u00e1squez (Mexican general)|R\u00e1fael V\u00e1squez]], invaded Texas for the first time since the revolution. They soon headed back to the Rio Grande after briefly occupying San Antonio. 1,400 Mexican troops, led by the French mercenary general [[Adrian Woll]] launched a second attack and captured San Antonio on September 11, 1842. A Texas militia retaliated at the [[Battle of Salado Creek (1842)|Battle of Salado Creek]]. However, on September 18, this militia was defeated by Mexican soldiers and Texas Cherokee Indians during the [[Dawson Massacre]].<ref>{{cite Handbook of Texas |first=Thomas W. |last=Cutrer |date=June 12, 2010 |title=Dawson Massacre  |id=qfd01}}</ref> The Mexican army would later retreat from the city of San Antonio.\n\nMexico's attacks on Texas intensified the conflict between the political factions in an incident known as the [[Texas Archive War]] in 1842. To \"protect\" the Texas national archives, President Sam Houston ordered them out of Austin. Austin residents, suspicious of the president's motives because of his avowed disdain of the capital, forced the archives back to Austin at gunpoint. The Texas Congress admonished Houston for the incident, and the incident would solidify Austin as Texas's seat of government for the Republic and the future state.<ref name=\"archivewar\">{{cite web |title=The Archives War |work=Texas Treasures- The Republic |publisher=The Texas State Library and Archives Commission |date=November 2, 2005 |url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/treasures/republic/archwar/archwar.html |accessdate=January 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Statehood, war, and expansion: 1845\u20131860==\n{{Main article|History of Texas (1845\u20131860)}}\n[[File:Texas Capitol Flags.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[U.S. Flag|U.S.]] and [[Flag of Texas|Texas]] flags at the [[Texas State Capitol]].]]\n\nOn February 28, 1845, the U.S. Congress narrowly passed a bill that authorized the United States to [[Texas Annexation|annex the Republic of Texas]] if it so voted. The legislation set the date for annexation for December 29 of the same year. On October 13 of the same year, a majority of voters in Texas approved a proposed constitution that specifically endorsed slavery and the [[slave trade]]. This constitution was later accepted by the U.S. Congress, making [[Texas]] a [[U.S. state]] on the same day annexation took effect (therefore bypassing a territorial phase).\n\nThe Mexican government had long warned that annexation would mean war with the United States. When Texas joined the U.S., the Mexican government broke diplomatic relations with the United States. The United States now assumed the claims of Texas when it claimed all land north of the Rio Grande. In June 1845, President [[James K. Polk]] sent General [[Zachary Taylor]] to Texas, and by October, 3,500 Americans were on the [[Nueces River]], prepared to defend Texas from a Mexican invasion. On November 10, 1845,<ref>{{harvp|Smith|1919|p=xi}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2015}}</ref> Polk ordered General Taylor and his forces south to the Rio Grande, into disputed territory that Mexicans claimed as their own. Mexico claimed the [[Nueces River]]\u2014about {{convert|150|mi|km}} north of the [[Rio Grande]]\u2014as its border with Texas.\n\nOn April 25, 1846, a 2,000-strong Mexican cavalry detachment attacked a 70-man U.S. patrol that had been sent into the contested territory north of the Rio Grande and south of the Nueces River. The Mexican cavalry routed the patrol, killing 16 U.S. soldiers in what later became known as the [[Thornton Affair]]. Both nations declared war. In the ensuing [[Mexican\u2013American War]], there were no more battles fought in Texas, but it became a major staging point for the American invasion of northern Mexico.\n\nOne of the primary motivations for annexation was the Texas government's huge debts. The United States agreed to assume many of these upon annexation. However, the former Republic never fully paid off its debt until the [[Compromise of 1850]]. In return for $10 million, a large portion of Texas-claimed territory, now parts of [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Wyoming]], was ceded to the Federal government.\n\n===Migration===\nIntensified migration to Texas after statehood raised the population to about 150,000. Societies such as the Texas Emigration and Land Company now pledged to settle colonists who would agree to constitute a militia for defense against the Indians; in return they would receive a grant of 320 acres of choice land. Most of the newcomers continued to migrate from the states of the lower South; slavery was granted legal protection by the Texas constitution of 1845. The Texas population by 1860 was quite diverse, with large elements of European whites (from the American South), African Americans (mostly slaves brought from the east), Tejanos (Hispanics with Spanish heritage), and about 20,000 recent German immigrants.<ref>Barnes F.

Jordan, ''German Seed in Texas Soil: Immigrant Farmers in Nineteenth-Century Texas'' (1966).</ref> \nAccording to the ''Handbook of Texas'' :\n:The Germans who settled Texas were diverse in many ways. They included peasant farmers and intellectuals; Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and atheists; Prussians, Saxons, Hessians, and Alsatians; abolitionists and slaveholders; farmers and townsfolk; frugal, honest folk and ax murderers. They differed in dialect, customs, and physical features. A majority had been farmers in Germany, and most arrived seeking economic opportunities. A few dissident intellectuals fleeing the 1848 revolutions in Germany sought political freedom, but few, save perhaps the Wends, went for religious freedom.  The German settlements in Texas reflected their diversity. Even in the confined area of the Hill Country, each valley offered a different kind of German. The Llano valley had stern, teetotaling German Methodists, who renounced dancing and fraternal organizations; the Pedernales valley had fun-loving, hardworking Lutherans and Catholics who enjoyed drinking and dancing; and the Guadalupe valley had atheist Germans descended from intellectual political refugees. The scattered German ethnic islands were also diverse. These small enclaves included Lindsay in Cooke County, largely Westphalian Catholic; Waka in Ochiltree County, Midwestern Mennonite; Hurnville in Clay County, Russian German Baptist; and Lockett in Wilbarger County, Wendish Lutheran.<ref>Handbook of Texas Online, Terry G.

Attracted to the rich farmland of Central Texas, Czechs settled in the counties of Austin, Fayette, Lavaca, and Washington. The [[Czech-American]] communities are characterized by a strong sense of community, and social clubs were a dominant aspect of Czech-American life in Texas. By 1865, the [[Czech Texans|Czech]] population numbered 700; by 1940 there were more than 60,000 Czech-Americans in Texas.<ref>{{cite HOT |first=Clinton |last=Machann |title=Czechs |id=plc02 |year=2010}}</ref>\n\n==Confederate Texas and Reconstruction: 1860\u20131876==\n{{Main article|Texas in the Civil War|History of Texas (1865\u20131899)}}\n\n[[File:Texas industries timeline.png|thumb|300px|Boom periods of the four major industries that built the early Texas economy.]]\nIn the summer of 1860, a slave panic erupted in North and East Texas amid rumors of arson by slaves and abolitionists. Called the \"Texas Troubles\", between 30 and 100 blacks and whites were lynched by vigilantes. The events were used to arouse support for secession.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/vetbr|title=Texas Troubles|last1=Reynolds|first1=Donald E.|date=June 15, 2010|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the [[Cotton Kingdom]], planters depended on slave labor.

The Secession Convention immediately organized a government, replacing [[Sam Houston]] when he refused to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy. <!-- This is from \"Historical Atlas of Texas\", by A. Ray Stephens and William M. Holmes, {{ISBN|0-8061-2307-9}} -->\n\nTexas declared its secession from the United States on February 1, 1861, and joined the [[Confederate States of America]] on March 2, 1861. With few battles in its territory, Texas was mainly a \"supply state\" for the Confederate forces until mid-1863, when the Union capture of the Mississippi River made large movements of men, horses or cattle impossible. Texas regiments fought in every major battle throughout the war. The last battle of the Civil War, the [[Battle of Palmito Ranch]], was fought in Texas on May 12, 1865. The 2nd Texas Cavalry Battalion (U.S.) (one of only two from the state) took part.\n\n===Unionism===\nSupport for the Confederacy was perhaps weakest in Texas; Elliott estimates that only a third of the white men in early 1861 supported the Confederacy. Many unionists supported the Confederacy after the war began, but many others clung to their unionism throughout the war, especially in the northern counties, the German districts, and the Mexican areas. Local officials harassed unionists and engaged in large-scale massacres against unionists and Germans. In [[Cooke County, Texas|Cooke County]], 150 suspected unionists were arrested; 25 were lynched without trial and 40 more were hanged after a summary trial. Draft resistance was widespread, especially among Texans of German or Mexican descent; many of the latter went to Mexico. Potential draftees went into hiding, Confederate officials hunted them down, and many were shot.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Claude |last=Elliott |title=Union Sentiment in Texas 1861-1865 |journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly |date=1947 |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=449\u2013477 |jstor=30237490}}</ref> On August 1, 1862 Confederate troops executed 34 pro-Union [[German Texans]] in the \"[[Nueces Massacre]]\" of civilians.\n\n===Historiography===\nDuring the 20th century, national historiographical trends influenced the scholarship on the Civil War in Texas. Beginning in the 1950s, historians focused on military campaigns in Texas and other areas of the Southwest, a region previously neglected. Since the 1970s, scholars have shifted their attention to South Texas, exploring how its relations with Mexico and Mexican Americans affected both Confederate and Union Civil War military operations. Also since the 1970s, the \"New Social History\" has stimulated research in war-related social, economic, and political changes. This historiographical trend is related to a growing interest in local and regional history.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Walter F. |last=Bell |title=Civil War Texas: A Review of the Historical Literature |journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly |date=2005 |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=20\n\n===Reconstruction===\nWhen news of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] arrived in Galveston on June 19, 1865, freed slaves rejoiced, creating the celebration of [[Juneteenth]]. The State had suffered little during the war, but trade and finance had been disrupted. Angry returning veterans seized state property, and Texas went through a period of extensive violence and disorder. Most outrages took place in northern Texas; outlaws based in the [[Indian Territory]] plundered and murdered without distinction of party.<ref>{{cite book |first=Charles W. |last=Ramsdell |title=Reconstruction in Texas |date=1910 |publisher=Columbia University |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cvRYAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>\n\nPresident Andrew Johnson appointed Union General [[A. J. Hamilton]] as provisional governor on June 17, 1865. Hamilton had been a prominent politician before the war. He granted amnesty to ex-Confederates if they promised to support the Union in the future, appointing some to office. On March 30, 1870, although Texas did not meet all the requirements, Congress restored Texas to the Union.\n\nMany free blacks were able to become businessmen and leaders. Through the young [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] blacks rapidly gained political power. Indeed, blacks comprised 90% of the Texas Republican Party during the 1880s.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas | title=AFRICAN AMERICANS AND POLITICS | id=wmafr}}</ref> [[Norris Wright Cuney]], an African American from Galveston, rose to the chairmanship of the Texas Republican Party and even the national committeeman.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas | title=LATE NINETEENTH-CENTURY TEXAS | id=npl01}}</ref>\n\n===Democrats regain control after Reconstruction===\nLike other Southern states, by the late 1870s white Democrats regained control of the state legislature.

The movement had its origins in Texas but spread across the nation.

Despite this, freedmen pursued education, organized new churches and fraternal organizations, and entered politics, winning local offices.

Mississippi's new constitution of 1890 had survived a Supreme Court case, although in practice it was highly discriminatory against freedmen.\n\n===Land use politics===\nMuch of Texas politics of the remainder of the 19th century centered on land use. Guided by the federal [[Morill Act]], Texas sold public lands to gain funds to invest in higher education.

Conflict became violent and the Jaybirds ordered several blacks out of town. Tensions increased and a total of seven people were killed. In the fall of 1889, the Democratic Party created \"white-only pre-primary elections,\" which in practice were the only competitive contests in the county, and thus [[Disenfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] the blacks.

The investigation resulted in a number of indictments, including one for Rockefeller.

Houston quickly grew once the Channel was completed, and rapidly became the primary port in Texas. Railroads were constructed in a radial pattern to link Houston with other major cities such as Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, and Austin.\n\nBy 1900, the Dallas population reached 38,000 as banking and insurance became major activities in the increasingly white-collar city, which was now the world's leading cotton center. It was also the world's center of harness making and leather goods. Businessmen took control of civic affairs; with little municipal patronage, there was only a small role for the Democratic Party to play. The predominantly black Republican Party was essentially closed out of politics by the disenfranchisement in 1901 of most blacks through imposition of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] (see below).\n\n===Disenfranchisement===\nDetermined to control politics in the state, reduce competition from Republicans and Populists, and close blacks out of politics, in 1901 the Democrat-dominated state legislature passed a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] as a requirement for voting.

By 1906, the number of black voters had dropped from more than 100,000 in the 1890s to 5,000. The state also passed a law for [[white primaries]].<ref name=Dulaney/> In 1896, 86.6% of all voters in Texas voted in the presidential election; following disenfranchisement, voter turnout in 1904 was 29.2% and in 1920 was 21.6%.<ref>{{cite web |title=Turnout in Presidential Elections: Texas, the South and the Nation, 1848-2012 |website=Texas Politics |publisher=Liberal Arts Instructional Technology Services, University of Texas at Austin |date=2006 |url=http://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/vce/features/0503_02/slide1.html |access-date=November 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Supreme Court ruled in 1923 that white primaries established by political parties were unconstitutional, in 1927 the Texas state legislature passed a bill that authorized political parties to establish their internal practices. The Democratic Party reinstated the white primary. That law survived until 1944 before another Supreme Court case ruled that it was unconstitutional. After 1944, the [[NAACP]] and other organizations worked to register black voters and participation increased. But the major disenfranchisement continued until passage in the mid-1960s of civil rights legislation, including the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965, to provide for federal oversight in areas in which historically minorities did not vote in expected numbers based on population.<ref name=\"Hist Barriers\"/>\n\n===Dallas growth===\n[[File:Dallas-Praetorian.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Praetorian Building]] in Dallas, completed 1909, was the first skyscraper west of the Mississippi and the tallest in Texas.]]\nTexans in 1909 marked an icon of progress with the construction of the first skyscraper west of the Mississippi.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jay C.

The resulting [[Texas Oil Boom]] permanently transformed the economy of Texas, and led to its most significant economic expansion after the Civil War.\n\n===Great Depression===\nThe economy, which had experienced significant recovery since the Civil War, was dealt a double blow by [[Great Depression in the United States|the Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]]. After the [[Stock Market Crash]] of 1929, the economy suffered significant reversals.

The war dramatically expanded the city's economic base, thanks to massive federal spending. Energetic entrepreneurs, most notably George Brown, James Elkins and James Abercrombie, landed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal wartime investment in technologically complex facilities. Houston oil companies moved from being refiners and became sophisticated producers of petrochemicals. Especially important were synthetic rubber and high octane fuel, which retained their importance after the war. The war moved the natural gas industry from a minor factor to a major energy source; Houston became a major hub when a local firm purchased the federally-financed Inch pipelines. Other major growth industries included steel, munitions, and shipbuilding.\n\nTens of thousands of new migrants streamed in from rural areas, straining the city's housing supply and the city's ability to provide local transit and schools.

The Native Americans' ancestors had been there for more than 10,000 years as evidenced by the discovery of the remains of prehistoric [[Leanderthal Lady]]. During the period of recorded history from A.D. 1519 to 1848, all or parts of Texas were claimed by five countries: [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Mexico]], the [[Republic of Texas]], and the [[United States of America]] as well as the [[Confederate States of America|confederacy]] during [[American Civil War|the civil war]].\n\nThe first [[Europe]]an base was established in 1680, along the upper [[Rio Grande]] river, near modern   [[El Paso]], [[Texas]] with the exiled Spaniards and Native Americans from the [[Isleta]] Pueblo during the [[Pueblo Revolt]], also known as [[Pop\u00e9's Rebellion]], from  today's northern [[New Mexico]]. In 1682, [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] (1643-1687),  established a  [[French colonization of Texas|French colony]] at [[Fort Saint Louis (Texas)|Fort Saint Louis]], after sailing down and exploring the [[Mississippi River]] from [[New France]]  (modern [[Canada]]) and the [[Great Lakes]]. He planted this  early French presence at [[Fort Saint Louis (Texas)|Fort Saint Louis]]  near [[Matagorda Bay]], along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast (near modern [[Inez, Texas]]), even before the establishment of [[New Orleans]] on the lower [[Mississippi River]]. The colony was killed off by Native Americans after three years, but Spanish authorities felt pressed to establish settlements to keep their claim to the land. Several [[Spanish missions in Texas|Roman Catholic missions]] were established in [[East Texas]]; they were abandoned in 1691. Twenty years later, concerned with the continued French presence in neighboring [[Louisiana]], Spanish authorities again tried to colonize Texas. Over the next 110 years, Spain established numerous villages, ''[[presidio]]s'', and missions in the province. A small number of Spanish settlers arrived, in addition to missionaries and soldiers. Spain signed agreements with colonizers from the [[United States]], bordering the province to the northeast ever since their [[Louisiana Purchase]] from the Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon I]] and his [[First French Empire|French Empire]] ([[France]]) in 1803. When Mexico won its [[Mexican War of Independence|independence from Spain in 1821]], [[Mexican Texas]] was part of the new nation. To encourage settlement, Mexican authorities allowed organized immigration from the United States, and by 1834, over 30,000&nbsp;Anglos lived in Texas,<ref name=manchaca201>{{citation |last=Manchaca |first=Martha |title=Recovering History, Constructing Race: The Indian, Black, and White Roots of Mexican Americans|series=The Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long Series in Latin American and Latino Art and Culture|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|location=Austin |year=2001 |p=201 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFn5bnx2OBcC |isbn=978-0-292-75253-5}}</ref> compared to 7,800&nbsp;Mexicans.<ref name=manchaca172>{{harvp|Manchaca|2001|p=172}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]]'s dissolution of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]] and his political shift to the right, issues such as lack of access to courts, the militarization of the region's government (e.g., response to Saltillo-Monclova problem), and self-defense issues resulting in the confrontation in Gonzales, public sentiment in Mexican and Anglo Texans turned towards revolution. Santa Anna's invasion of the territory after putting down the rebellion in [[Zacatecas]] provoked the conflict of 1836. The [[Texian Army|Texian forces]] fought and won the [[Texas Revolution]] in 1835\u20131836.\n\nAlthough not recognized as such by Mexico, Texas declared itself an independent nation, the [[Republic of Texas]]. Attracted by the rich lands for cotton plantations and ranching, tens of thousands of immigrants arrived from the U.S. and from [[Germany]] as well. In 1845, Texas [[Texas Annexation|joined the United States]], becoming the 28th state, when the United States annexed it. Only after the conclusion of the Mexican\u2013American War, with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848, did Mexico recognize Texan independence. Texas declared its secession from the United States in 1861 to join the Confederate States of America. Only a few battles of the [[American Civil War]] were fought in Texas; most Texas regiments served in the east. When the war ended, the enslaved African Americans were freed. Texas was subject to [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], a process that left a residue of bitterness among whites. They regained political dominance and passed laws in the late 19th century creating second-class status for blacks in a [[Jim Crow]] system of segregation and disenfranchising them in 1901 through passage of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]]. Blacks were excluded from the formal political system until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.\n\nCotton, ranching, and farming dominated the economy, with [[railroad]] construction after 1870 a major factor in the development of new cities away from rivers and waterways. Toward the end of the 19th century, timber became an important industry in Texas as well. In 1901 a [[petroleum]] discovery at [[Spindletop|Spindletop Hill]], near Beaumont, was developed as the most productive oil well the world had ever seen. The wave of oil speculation and discovery that followed came to be known as the \"[[Texas Oil Boom|Oil Boom]]\", permanently transforming and enriching the economy of Texas. Agriculture and ranching gave way to a service-oriented society after the boom years of World War II. Segregation ended in the 1960s due to federal legislation. Politically, Texas changed from the virtually one-party Democratic state achieved following disenfranchisement, to a highly contested political scene, until 2000 when it was solidly Republican. The economy of Texas has continued to grow rapidly, becoming the second-largest state in population in 1994, and became economically highly diversified, with a growing base in new technology.\n\n=={{visible anchor|Pre-Columbian history|Indigenous peoples}}==\n{{Further information|Pre-Columbian Mexico}}\nTexas lies at the juncture of two major cultural spheres of [[Pre-Columbian North America]], the [[Southwestern tribes|Southwestern]] and the [[Plains Indians|Plains]] areas.

They extracted [[Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument|Alibates flint]] from quarries in the [[Texas panhandle|panhandle]] region.\n\nBeginning during the [[4th millennium BC]], the population of Texas increased despite a [[climate change (general concept)|changing climate]] and the [[Holocene extinction event|extinction of giant mammals]]. Many [[pictogram]]s from this era, drawn on the walls of caves or on rocks, are visible in the state, including at [[Hueco Tanks]]<ref name=\"Sutherland\">{{cite report |last=Sutherland |first=Kay |title=Rock Paintings at Hueco Tanks State Historic Site |publisher=Texas Parks & Wildlife |location=Austin |date=2006 |url=https://tpwd.texas.gov/publications/pwdpubs/media/pwd_bk_p4501_0095e.pdf}}</ref> and Seminole Canyon.\n\nNative Americans in East Texas began to [[Sedentism|settle]] in villages shortly after 500 BC, farming and building the first burial [[mound]]s. They were influenced by the [[Mississippian culture]], which had major sites throughout the Mississippi basin.<ref name=\"Hester\"/> In the [[Trans-Pecos]] area, populations were influenced by [[Mogollon culture]].\n\nFrom the 8th century, the bow and arrow appeared in the region,<ref name=\"Hester\"/> manufacture of pottery developed, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] increasingly depended on [[bison]] for survival. [[Obsidian]] objects found in various Texan sites attest of trade with cultures in present-day Mexico and the [[Rocky Mountains]], as the material is not found locally.\n\nAs of the colonial period, Texas was largely divided between 6 culture groups. The Caddoan peoples occupied the area surrounding the entire length of the Red River. Upon contact with Europeans, they formed four collective confederacies known as the [[Natchitoches people|Natchitoches]], the [[Hasinai]], the [[Wichita people|Wichita]] & the [[Caddo|Kadohadocho]] (Caddo). All four of them held some land in what is now Texas.<ref>Louis F. Burns, \"Osage\" Archived January 2, 2011, at the Wayback Machine.

While the northern-most groups faced a cultural collapse due to a drought, many of the southern tribes survive to the present. North of the Pueblos were the Apachean tribes. Although commonly referred to as one, single nation, they are actually a culture group.<ref>Brugge, David M. (1968). Navajos in the Catholic Church Records of New Mexico 1694 - 1875.

The Coahuiltecans, at some point, would have migrated south to merge with their sister tribes. In the 18th century, the Creek Confederacy formed on the east coast, forcing several smaller Muskogean peoples out of the state. They may have migrated to Texas & Mexico, where they were absorbed into other tribes. The Choctaw also split and one of their four subtribes, the [[Houma people|Houma]] came to reside in the eastern region the state before returning to Louisiana.\n\nAfter the American Revolution, many tribes were being consistently moved to migrate further west and give up their lands to American citizens. This may have been due to the unusual circumstance that the United States still considered many of these tribes as foreign nations, but outwardly claimed the land they stood on. That being said, the main push was for new, rich farmland as the plantation-style farming on the east coast soon damaged the native soil. Many tribes in the early 19th century became fed up with these practices, choosing to migrate to Texas, which was still a part of New Spain at the time. These tribes include the [[Mingo | Mingo Seneca]], the [[Lenape]],<ref>Carol A. Lipscomb, \"DELAWARE INDIANS\", Handbook of Texas Online, accessed July 8, 2012.

Their opponents, led by Sam Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful co-existence with Native Americans.\n\nAlthough Texas governed itself, Mexico refused to recognize its independence.<ref name=vazquez76>{{harvp|Vazquez|1997|p=76}}</ref> On March 5, 1842, a Mexican force of over 500 men, led by [[R\u00e1fael V\u00e1squez (Mexican general)|R\u00e1fael V\u00e1squez]], invaded Texas for the first time since the revolution. They soon headed back to the Rio Grande after briefly occupying San Antonio. 1,400 Mexican troops, led by the French mercenary general [[Adrian Woll]] launched a second attack and captured San Antonio on September 11, 1842. A Texas militia retaliated at the [[Battle of Salado Creek (1842)|Battle of Salado Creek]]. However, on September 18, this militia was defeated by Mexican soldiers and Texas Cherokee Indians during the [[Dawson Massacre]].<ref>{{cite Handbook of Texas |first=Thomas W. |last=Cutrer |date=June 12, 2010 |title=Dawson Massacre  |id=qfd01}}</ref> The Mexican army would later retreat from the city of San Antonio.\n\nMexico's attacks on Texas intensified the conflict between the political factions in an incident known as the [[Texas Archive War]] in 1842. To \"protect\" the Texas national archives, President Sam Houston ordered them out of Austin. Austin residents, suspicious of the president's motives because of his avowed disdain of the capital, forced the archives back to Austin at gunpoint. The Texas Congress admonished Houston for the incident, and the incident would solidify Austin as Texas's seat of government for the Republic and the future state.<ref name=\"archivewar\">{{cite web |title=The Archives War |work=Texas Treasures- The Republic |publisher=The Texas State Library and Archives Commission |date=November 2, 2005 |url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/treasures/republic/archwar/archwar.html |accessdate=January 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Statehood, war, and expansion: 1845\u20131860==\n{{Main article|History of Texas (1845\u20131860)}}\n[[File:Texas Capitol Flags.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[U.S. Flag|U.S.]] and [[Flag of Texas|Texas]] flags at the [[Texas State Capitol]].]]\n\nOn February 28, 1845, the U.S. Congress narrowly passed a bill that authorized the United States to [[Texas Annexation|annex the Republic of Texas]] if it so voted. The legislation set the date for annexation for December 29 of the same year. On October 13 of the same year, a majority of voters in Texas approved a proposed constitution that specifically endorsed slavery and the [[slave trade]]. This constitution was later accepted by the U.S. Congress, making [[Texas]] a [[U.S. state]] on the same day annexation took effect (therefore bypassing a territorial phase).\n\nThe Mexican government had long warned that annexation would mean war with the United States. When Texas joined the U.S., the Mexican government broke diplomatic relations with the United States. The United States now assumed the claims of Texas when it claimed all land north of the Rio Grande. In June 1845, President [[James K. Polk]] sent General [[Zachary Taylor]] to Texas, and by October, 3,500 Americans were on the [[Nueces River]], prepared to defend Texas from a Mexican invasion. On November 10, 1845,<ref>{{harvp|Smith|1919|p=xi}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2015}}</ref> Polk ordered General Taylor and his forces south to the Rio Grande, into disputed territory that Mexicans claimed as their own. Mexico claimed the [[Nueces River]]\u2014about {{convert|150|mi|km}} north of the [[Rio Grande]]\u2014as its border with Texas.\n\nOn April 25, 1846, a 2,000-strong Mexican cavalry detachment attacked a 70-man U.S. patrol that had been sent into the contested territory north of the Rio Grande and south of the Nueces River. The Mexican cavalry routed the patrol, killing 16 U.S. soldiers in what later became known as the [[Thornton Affair]]. Both nations declared war. In the ensuing [[Mexican\u2013American War]], there were no more battles fought in Texas, but it became a major staging point for the American invasion of northern Mexico.\n\nOne of the primary motivations for annexation was the Texas government's huge debts. The United States agreed to assume many of these upon annexation. However, the former Republic never fully paid off its debt until the [[Compromise of 1850]]. In return for $10 million, a large portion of Texas-claimed territory, now parts of [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Wyoming]], was ceded to the Federal government.\n\n===Migration===\nIntensified migration to Texas after statehood raised the population to about 150,000. Societies such as the Texas Emigration and Land Company now pledged to settle colonists who would agree to constitute a militia for defense against the Indians; in return they would receive a grant of 320 acres of choice land. Most of the newcomers continued to migrate from the states of the lower South; slavery was granted legal protection by the Texas constitution of 1845. The Texas population by 1860 was quite diverse, with large elements of European whites (from the American South), African Americans (mostly slaves brought from the east), Tejanos (Hispanics with Spanish heritage), and about 20,000 recent German immigrants.<ref>Barnes F.

They included peasant farmers and intellectuals; Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and atheists; Prussians, Saxons, Hessians, and Alsatians; abolitionists and slaveholders; farmers and townsfolk; frugal, honest folk and ax murderers. They differed in dialect, customs, and physical features. A majority had been farmers in Germany, and most arrived seeking economic opportunities. A few dissident intellectuals fleeing the 1848 revolutions in Germany sought political freedom, but few, save perhaps the Wends, went for religious freedom.  The German settlements in Texas reflected their diversity. Even in the confined area of the Hill Country, each valley offered a different kind of German. The Llano valley had stern, teetotaling German Methodists, who renounced dancing and fraternal organizations; the Pedernales valley had fun-loving, hardworking Lutherans and Catholics who enjoyed drinking and dancing; and the Guadalupe valley had atheist Germans descended from intellectual political refugees. The scattered German ethnic islands were also diverse. These small enclaves included Lindsay in Cooke County, largely Westphalian Catholic; Waka in Ochiltree County, Midwestern Mennonite; Hurnville in Clay County, Russian German Baptist; and Lockett in Wilbarger County, Wendish Lutheran.<ref>Handbook of Texas Online, Terry G.

The [[Czech-American]] communities are characterized by a strong sense of community, and social clubs were a dominant aspect of Czech-American life in Texas.

Ray Stephens and William M. Holmes, {{ISBN|0-8061-2307-9}} -->\n\nTexas declared its secession from the United States on February 1, 1861, and joined the [[Confederate States of America]] on March 2, 1861. With few battles in its territory, Texas was mainly a \"supply state\" for the Confederate forces until mid-1863, when the Union capture of the Mississippi River made large movements of men, horses or cattle impossible. Texas regiments fought in every major battle throughout the war. The last battle of the Civil War, the [[Battle of Palmito Ranch]], was fought in Texas on May 12, 1865. The 2nd Texas Cavalry Battalion (U.S.) (one of only two from the state) took part.\n\n===Unionism===\nSupport for the Confederacy was perhaps weakest in Texas; Elliott estimates that only a third of the white men in early 1861 supported the Confederacy. Many unionists supported the Confederacy after the war began, but many others clung to their unionism throughout the war, especially in the northern counties, the German districts, and the Mexican areas. Local officials harassed unionists and engaged in large-scale massacres against unionists and Germans. In [[Cooke County, Texas|Cooke County]], 150 suspected unionists were arrested; 25 were lynched without trial and 40 more were hanged after a summary trial. Draft resistance was widespread, especially among Texans of German or Mexican descent; many of the latter went to Mexico.

Beginning in the 1950s, historians focused on military campaigns in Texas and other areas of the Southwest, a region previously neglected. Since the 1970s, scholars have shifted their attention to South Texas, exploring how its relations with Mexico and Mexican Americans affected both Confederate and Union Civil War military operations. Also since the 1970s, the \"New Social History\" has stimulated research in war-related social, economic, and political changes.

The State had suffered little during the war, but trade and finance had been disrupted.

On March 30, 1870, although Texas did not meet all the requirements, Congress restored Texas to the Union.\n\nMany free blacks were able to become businessmen and leaders. Through the young [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] blacks rapidly gained political power.

Mississippi's new constitution of 1890 had survived a Supreme Court case, although in practice it was highly discriminatory against freedmen.\n\n===Land use politics===\nMuch of Texas politics of the remainder of the 19th century centered on land use.

In the fall of 1889, the Democratic Party created \"white-only pre-primary elections,\" which in practice were the only competitive contests in the county, and thus [[Disenfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] the blacks.

Hogg and his attorney-general argued that the companies were engaged in rebates, [[price fixing]], consolidation, and other tactics prohibited by the state's 1889 antitrust act. The investigation resulted in a number of indictments, including one for Rockefeller.

The war dramatically expanded the city's economic base, thanks to massive federal spending. Energetic entrepreneurs, most notably George Brown, James Elkins and James Abercrombie, landed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal wartime investment in technologically complex facilities. Houston oil companies moved from being refiners and became sophisticated producers of petrochemicals. Especially important were synthetic rubber and high octane fuel, which retained their importance after the war. The war moved the natural gas industry from a minor factor to a major energy source; Houston became a major hub when a local firm purchased the federally-financed Inch pipelines. Other major growth industries included steel, munitions, and shipbuilding.\n\nTens of thousands of new migrants streamed in from rural areas, straining the city's housing supply and the city's ability to provide local transit and schools. For the first time, high-paying jobs went to large numbers of women, blacks and Hispanics. The city's African-American community, emboldened by their newfound prosperity, increased its agitation for civil rights; they backed and funded the legal case of ''[[Smith v.
