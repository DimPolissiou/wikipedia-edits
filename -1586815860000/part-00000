The UK's [[National Nuclear Laboratory]] has its Central Laboratory and headquarters on the site.\n\nOriginally built as a Royal Ordnance Factory in 1942, the site briefly passed into the ownership of [[Courtaulds]] for [[rayon]] manufacture following [[WW2]], but was re-acquired by the [[Ministry of Supply]] in 1947 for the production of [[plutonium]] for nuclear weapons, and was given the name \"Windscale Works\". Subsequent key developments include the building of Calder Hall nuclear power station, the [[b205|Magnox fuel reprocessing plant]], the prototype [[Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor]] (AGR) and the [[Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant]] (THORP).\n\nCurrent (2019) activities at the Sellafield site are primarily decommissioning of historic plants, and reprocessing of spent fuel from UK and international nuclear reactors which will completely cease when the Magnox fuel reprocessing plant closes in 2020.

Construction of the nuclear facilities commenced in September 1947 and the site was renamed Windscale Works. The building of the nuclear plant was a huge construction project, requiring a peak effort of 5,000 workers. The two air-cooled and open-circuit, [[graphite]]-moderated Windscale reactors (the \"[[Windscale Piles]]\") and the associated first generation reprocessing plant, producing the first British weapons grade [[plutonium-239]] were central to the UK nuclear weapons programme of the 1950s.\n\nWindscale Pile No. 1 became operational in October 1950, just over three years from the start of construction, and Pile No. 2 became operational in June 1951. Later in 1957 Pile 1 suffered a major accident; the [[Windscale fire]], the worst nuclear accident in UK history, ranked in severity at level 5 out of a possible 7 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]].\n\n===Calder Hall power station===\n[[File:Calder Hall, Queen opening.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] officially opening Calder Hall nuclear power station on 17 October 1956]]\nWith the creation of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) in 1954, ownership of Windscale Works passed to the UKAEA. The first of four [[Magnox]] reactors became operational in 1956 at Calder Hall, a site \nextension across the River Calder, and the whole site became known as Windscale and Calder Works.\n\n===British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL)===\nFollowing the break-up of the UKAEA into a research division (UKAEA) and a newly-created company for nuclear production [[British Nuclear Fuels Ltd]] (BNFL) in 1971, a major part of the site was transferred to BNFL ownership and management. In 1981 BNFL's Windscale and Calder Works was renamed Sellafield as part of a major reorganisation of the site and there was a consolidation of management under one head of the entire BNFL Sellafield site. The remainder of the site remained in the hands of the UKAEA and was still called Windscale.<ref>Cassidy, Nick, and Patrick Green. 1993. ''Sellafield: The contaminated legacy''.

Construction of the nuclear facilities commenced in September 1947 and the site was renamed Windscale Works. The building of the nuclear plant was a huge construction project, requiring a peak effort of 5,000 workers. The two air-cooled and open-circuit, [[graphite]]-moderated Windscale reactors (the \"[[Windscale Piles]]\") and the associated first generation reprocessing plant, producing the first British weapons grade [[plutonium-239]] were central to the UK nuclear weapons programme of the 1950s.\n\nWindscale Pile No. 1 became operational in October 1950, just over three years from the start of construction, and Pile No. 2 became operational in June 1951. Later in 1957 Pile 1 suffered a major accident; the [[Windscale fire]], the worst nuclear accident in UK history, ranked in severity at level 5 out of a possible 7 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]].\n\n===Calder Hall power station===\n[[File:Calder Hall, Queen opening.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] officially opening Calder Hall nuclear power station on 17 October 1956]]\nWith the creation of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) in 1954, ownership of Windscale Works passed to the UKAEA. The first of four [[Magnox]] reactors became operational in 1956 at Calder Hall, a site \nextension across the River Calder, and the whole site became known as Windscale and Calder Works.\n\n===British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL)===\nFollowing the break-up of the UKAEA into a research division (UKAEA) and a newly-created company for nuclear production [[British Nuclear Fuels Ltd]] (BNFL) in 1971, a major part of the site was transferred to BNFL ownership and management. In 1981 BNFL's Windscale and Calder Works was renamed Sellafield as part of a major reorganisation of the site and there was a consolidation of management under one head of the entire BNFL Sellafield site. The remainder of the site remained in the hands of the UKAEA and was still called Windscale.<ref>Cassidy, Nick, and Patrick Green. 1993. ''Sellafield: The contaminated legacy''.

sea, using a [[flocculation]] process to remove radioactivity from liquid effluent before discharge. Metals dissolved in acidic effluents were made to produce a metal hydroxide flocculant [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] following the addition of [[ammonium hydroxide]]. The suspension was then transferred to settling tanks where the precipitate would settle out, and the remaining clarified liquid, or [[supernate]], would be discharged to the [[Irish Sea]]. As an improvement to that process, in 1994 the Enhanced Actinide Removal Plant (EARP) became operational.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In EARP the effectiveness of the process is enhanced by the addition of reagents to remove the remaining soluble radioactive species. EARP was enhanced further in 2004 to further reduce the quantities of [[technetium-99]] released to the environment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Treating a 50-year-old legacy of radioactive sludge waste |author=Ben Irons |work=Engineer Live |url=http://www.engineerlive.com/power-engineer/nuclear-power/14432/treating-a-50yearold-legacy-of-radioactive-sludge-waste.thtml |accessdate=21 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126051749/http://www.engineerlive.com/power-engineer/nuclear-power/14432/treating-a-50yearold-legacy-of-radioactive-sludge-waste.thtml |archivedate=26 January 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Radioactive waste stores===\nSellafield has a number of radioactive waste stores, mostly working on an interim basis while a [[deep geological repository]] plan is developed and implemented.\n\nThe stores include:\n<ref name=\"NDA-site-summary-2006\">{{cite report |url=http://www.nda.gov.uk/documents/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&pageid=4007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110103707/http://www.nda.gov.uk/documents/loader.cfm?url=%2Fcommonspot%2Fsecurity%2Fgetfile.cfm&pageid=4007 |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 November 2007 |title=Sellafield Site Summary \u2013 2006/07 Lifetime Plan (Rev.

His book, ''What We Owe to Each Other'', was published by [[Harvard University Press]] in 1998; a collection of papers on political theory, ''The Difficulty of Tolerance'', was published by Cambridge University Press in 2003.\n\nScanlon is the father-in-law of philosopher and scholar of [[African-American studies]] [[Tommie Shelby]].\n\n==Philosophical work==\n\nHis dissertation and some of his first papers were in [[mathematical logic]], where his main concern was in [[proof theory]], but he turned to [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]], where he developed a version of [[contractualism]] in the line of [[John Rawls]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].  Scanlon has also published important work on [[freedom of speech]], equality, [[toleration|tolerance]], foundations of [[contract law]], [[human rights]], conceptions of [[welfare]], theories of justice, as well as on foundational questions in moral theory.\n\n=== Contractualism ===\n{{essay|date=July 2019}}\nContractualism is an attempt at providing a unified account of the subject matter of a central part of morality which Scanlon calls \"what we owe to each other\". The normative domain of what we owe to each other is meant to encompass those duties to other people which we bear in virtue of their standing as rational creatures. A broader conception of morality includes whatever else we may owe to specific people, such as the special obligations we bear in relations with friends and family, or whatever else morality may require of us, such as the way in which we treat ourselves or nature. Scanlon believes that what we owe to each other, or what we could loosely call \"the morality of right and wrong\", is distinct from this broader conception of morality in that contractualism provides a unified account of its content.<ref>Scanlon, T.&nbsp;M., 1998, ''What We Owe to Each Other'', pp. 6\u20137</ref>\n\nIn Scanlon's contractualism, judgements about right and wrong, unlike [[empirical]] judgements, are not theoretical claims about the nature of the [[spatiotemporal]] world but rather practical claims about what we have reason to do.<ref>Scanlon 2</ref> Further, they are a particularly important class of practical claims in that the judgement that an action is wrong is taken to provide reasons to not do that action which are most often considered to be decisive against competing reasons.<ref>Scanlon 1</ref> Following this point, Scanlon takes questions about the reason-giving force of moral judgements to be prior to questions about the subject matter of the morality of right and wrong.<ref>Scanlon 3</ref> More explicitly, he thinks that if we provide an account of the extraordinary reason-giving force of moral judgements then this account could largely form the basis for a characterisation of the subject matter of what we owe to each other.\n\nScanlon grounds the reason-giving force of judgements about right and wrong in \"the positive value of a way of living with others\".<ref>Scanlon 162</ref> A way of living with others which is typified by an ideal of mutual recognition between rational agents, where mutual recognition demands that moral agents acknowledge the value of human life and respond to this value in the right ways.\n\nOn the question of how ought we to value human, or rational, life, Scanlon argues that different valuable things require different ways of valuing. In contrast to [[teleological]] accounts of value, often to take something to be of value is not only to see reason to bring about a maximal amount of that thing.<ref>Scanlon 78\u2013100</ref> This is especially true when considering the value of human life. When we value human life, he writes, we do not see this as a reason to create as much human life as we can. Rather, we tend to see reason to respect other human beings, to protect them from death and other forms of harm and, in general, to want their lives to go well. More important for Scanlon, to value rational life is to recognize the features which distinguish rational life from other valuable things, specifically, the ability of rational creatures to assess reasons and judgements, and to govern their lives in accordance with these assessments. Scanlon asserts that the proper response to the recognition of these distinctive features is to treat rational creatures in terms of principles which they could not reasonably reject.<ref>Scanlon 105\u2013106</ref>\n\nFrom this point, Scanlon's account of the value of rational life provides a focus around which his account of the reason-giving force of moral judgements dovetails quite neatly with a characterization of the method of reasoning which we use to arrive at judgements of right and wrong, a method, moreover, which seems to be phenomenologically plausible. The reason-giving force of moral judgements is grounded in an ideal of mutual recognition which requires treating others in accordance with principles that they could not reasonably reject. Because mutual recognition requires that these other people are also appropriately motivated, this entails Scanlon's formulation of wrongness: \"An act is wrong if and only if any principle that permitted it would be one that could reasonably be rejected by people moved to find principles for the general regulation of behaviour that others, similarly motivated, could not reasonably reject\".<ref>Scanlon 4</ref> I will call this the contractualist formulation. An act is right, quite simply, if a principle permitting it could not reasonably be rejected in terms of the aforementioned formulation.\n\nRegarding how moral principles are derived from the contractualist formulation, when considering whether a principle can be rejected we must take into account the consequences, in general, of its being accepted, not only the consequences of the particular actions that it allows.<ref>Scanlon 203\u2013204</ref> Because we cannot be sure about who will be affected by a principle, and how they will be affected, we must draw on our experience of life and consider the \"generic reasons\" which individuals are likely to have, as a result of their general circumstances, to reject a principle.<ref>Scanlon 204\u2013205</ref> In order to determine whether a principle is reasonably rejectable, we must impartially weigh these generic reasons against each other,<ref>Scanlon 195</ref> and exercising our judgement, draw a conclusion about what the weight of reasons support.<ref>Scanlon 218</ref> Given the motivation of finding principles for the general regulation of society that no-one could reasonably reject, if the weight of reasons support a certain conclusion then it would be unreasonable to reject that conclusion.<ref>Scanlon 192</ref> Importantly, principles can only be rejected by individuals; aggregation of reasons across individuals is not allowed.<ref>Scanlon 229\u2013230</ref> So if the generic reasons of an individual carry more weight than any other individual's generic reasons, then his generic reasons are (for the most part) decisive in determining principles.\n\nThe generic reasons which are open to consideration under the contractualist formulation are any reasons which we judge as relevant to reasonable rejectability. This requires that we exercise our judgement in determining whether such reasons would be suitable grounds for mutual recognition.<ref>Scanlon 194</ref> Therefore, that a principle would negatively affect a person's well-being is not the only kind of reason which may be brought against a principle. Other considerations, such as how a burden would be imposed by a principle, can serve as reasonable grounds for rejection.\n\nWhile contractualism only provides an account of that central part of morality which deals with what we owe to each other, Scanlon writes that this part of morality is related to the broader realm of morality in complex ways. There is pressure for the morality of what we owe to each other to acknowledge the values included in the broader realm of morality insofar as principles which don't make room for these values could be reasonably rejected. In turn, these values must accommodate the dictates of what we owe to each other to the extent that they involve relations with others, who have separate moral standing.<ref>Scanlon 174</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nScanlon's ''What We Owe to Each Other'' is referenced multiple times in the American television series ''[[The Good Place]]'', serving as the initial text used to instruct a woman who has apparently ended up in a [[Heaven]] by mistake.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Emily|title=Dystopia in 'The Good Place'|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/06/dystopia-in-the-good-place|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=5 February 2018|ref=Nussbaum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Lim|first1=Woojin|title=Asking Philosopher T.

His book, ''What We Owe to Each Other'', was published by [[Harvard University Press]] in 1998; a collection of papers on political theory, ''The Difficulty of Tolerance'', was published by Cambridge University Press in 2003.\n\nScanlon is the father-in-law of philosopher and scholar of [[African-American studies]] [[Tommie Shelby]].\n\n==Philosophical work==\n\nHis dissertation and some of his first papers were in [[mathematical logic]], where his main concern was in [[proof theory]], but he turned to [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]], where he developed a version of [[contractualism]] in the line of [[John Rawls]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].  Scanlon has also published important work on [[freedom of speech]], equality, [[toleration|tolerance]], foundations of [[contract law]], [[human rights]], conceptions of [[welfare]], theories of justice, as well as on foundational questions in moral theory.\n\n=== Contractualism ===\n{{essay|date=July 2019}}\nContractualism is an attempt at providing a unified account of the subject matter of a central part of morality which Scanlon calls \"what we owe to each other\". The normative domain of what we owe to each other is meant to encompass those duties to other people which we bear in virtue of their standing as rational creatures. A broader conception of morality includes whatever else we may owe to specific people, such as the special obligations we bear in relations with friends and family, or whatever else morality may require of us, such as the way in which we treat ourselves or nature. Scanlon believes that what we owe to each other, or what we could loosely call \"the morality of right and wrong\", is distinct from this broader conception of morality in that contractualism provides a unified account of its content.<ref>Scanlon, T.&nbsp;M., 1998, ''What We Owe to Each Other'', pp. 6\u20137</ref>\n\nIn Scanlon's contractualism, judgements about right and wrong, unlike [[empirical]] judgements, are not theoretical claims about the nature of the [[spatiotemporal]] world but rather practical claims about what we have reason to do.<ref>Scanlon 2</ref> Further, they are a particularly important class of practical claims in that the judgement that an action is wrong is taken to provide reasons to not do that action which are most often considered to be decisive against competing reasons.<ref>Scanlon 1</ref> Following this point, Scanlon takes questions about the reason-giving force of moral judgements to be prior to questions about the subject matter of the morality of right and wrong.<ref>Scanlon 3</ref> More explicitly, he thinks that if we provide an account of the extraordinary reason-giving force of moral judgements then this account could largely form the basis for a characterisation of the subject matter of what we owe to each other.\n\nScanlon grounds the reason-giving force of judgements about right and wrong in \"the positive value of a way of living with others\".<ref>Scanlon 162</ref> A way of living with others which is typified by an ideal of mutual recognition between rational agents, where mutual recognition demands that moral agents acknowledge the value of human life and respond to this value in the right ways.\n\nOn the question of how ought we to value human, or rational, life, Scanlon argues that different valuable things require different ways of valuing. In contrast to [[teleological]] accounts of value, often to take something to be of value is not only to see reason to bring about a maximal amount of that thing.<ref>Scanlon 78\u2013100</ref> This is especially true when considering the value of human life. When we value human life, he writes, we do not see this as a reason to create as much human life as we can. Rather, we tend to see reason to respect other human beings, to protect them from death and other forms of harm and, in general, to want their lives to go well. More important for Scanlon, to value rational life is to recognize the features which distinguish rational life from other valuable things, specifically, the ability of rational creatures to assess reasons and judgements, and to govern their lives in accordance with these assessments. Scanlon asserts that the proper response to the recognition of these distinctive features is to treat rational creatures in terms of principles which they could not reasonably reject.<ref>Scanlon 105\u2013106</ref>\n\nFrom this point, Scanlon's account of the value of rational life provides a focus around which his account of the reason-giving force of moral judgements dovetails quite neatly with a characterization of the method of reasoning which we use to arrive at judgements of right and wrong, a method, moreover, which seems to be phenomenologically plausible. The reason-giving force of moral judgements is grounded in an ideal of mutual recognition which requires treating others in accordance with principles that they could not reasonably reject. Because mutual recognition requires that these other people are also appropriately motivated, this entails Scanlon's formulation of wrongness: \"An act is wrong if and only if any principle that permitted it would be one that could reasonably be rejected by people moved to find principles for the general regulation of behaviour that others, similarly motivated, could not reasonably reject\".<ref>Scanlon 4</ref> I will call this the contractualist formulation. An act is right, quite simply, if a principle permitting it could not reasonably be rejected in terms of the aforementioned formulation.\n\nRegarding how moral principles are derived from the contractualist formulation, when considering whether a principle can be rejected we must take into account the consequences, in general, of its being accepted, not only the consequences of the particular actions that it allows.<ref>Scanlon 203\u2013204</ref> Because we cannot be sure about who will be affected by a principle, and how they will be affected, we must draw on our experience of life and consider the \"generic reasons\" which individuals are likely to have, as a result of their general circumstances, to reject a principle.<ref>Scanlon 204\u2013205</ref> In order to determine whether a principle is reasonably rejectable, we must impartially weigh these generic reasons against each other,<ref>Scanlon 195</ref> and exercising our judgement, draw a conclusion about what the weight of reasons support.<ref>Scanlon 218</ref> Given the motivation of finding principles for the general regulation of society that no-one could reasonably reject, if the weight of reasons support a certain conclusion then it would be unreasonable to reject that conclusion.<ref>Scanlon 192</ref> Importantly, principles can only be rejected by individuals; aggregation of reasons across individuals is not allowed.<ref>Scanlon 229\u2013230</ref> So if the generic reasons of an individual carry more weight than any other individual's generic reasons, then his generic reasons are (for the most part) decisive in determining principles.\n\nThe generic reasons which are open to consideration under the contractualist formulation are any reasons which we judge as relevant to reasonable rejectability. This requires that we exercise our judgement in determining whether such reasons would be suitable grounds for mutual recognition.<ref>Scanlon 194</ref> Therefore, that a principle would negatively affect a person's well-being is not the only kind of reason which may be brought against a principle. Other considerations, such as how a burden would be imposed by a principle, can serve as reasonable grounds for rejection.\n\nWhile contractualism only provides an account of that central part of morality which deals with what we owe to each other, Scanlon writes that this part of morality is related to the broader realm of morality in complex ways. There is pressure for the morality of what we owe to each other to acknowledge the values included in the broader realm of morality insofar as principles which don't make room for these values could be reasonably rejected.

Residents of Laranjeiras, then a district of [[Nossa Senhora do Socorro]] with a small port on the river, petitioned [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria]] for the construction of a church in 1790. With the completion of the church, Laranjeiras had two churches: the Parish Church and the [[Church of Our Lady of the Conception of Comandaroba|Church of Our Lady of the Conception]], which belonged to the Comandaroba Plantation. The church was unable to accommodate the population of Laranjeiras, which grew rapidly in the 18th century, and the building was enlarged in 1905.<ref name=\"f\"/><ref name=\"hpip\"/>\n\n==Location==\n\nThe Parish Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus is located on a high point above a bend in the [[Cotinguiba River]].

At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], Gaithersburg had a population of 59,933, making it the fourth-largest incorporated city in the state, behind [[Baltimore]], [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], and [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]].<ref>[https://www.census.gov U.S. Census website], U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved June 17, 2011.</ref> Gaithersburg is located to the northwest of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and is considered a suburb and a primary city within the [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington\u2013Arlington\u2013Alexandria, DC\u2013VA\u2013MD\u2013WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Gaithersburg was incorporated as a town in 1878 and as a city in 1968.\n\nGaithersburg is divided into east and west sections, separated by [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]]. The eastern section of the city is older and is the original portion of the town before more recent growth. Landmarks and buildings from that time can still be seen in many places but especially in the historic central business district of Gaithersburg called \"Olde Towne\". The east side also includes [[Lakeforest Mall]], City Hall, and the Montgomery County Fair grounds, and Bohrer Park (a well-known joint community recreation center and outdoor water park for kids and families). The west side of the city has many wealthier neighborhoods that were designed with smart growth techniques and embrace [[New Urbanism]].  These include the award-winning [[Kentlands]] community, the Lakelands community, and the Washingtonian Center (better known as Rio), a popular shopping/business district. Consumers often come to this area during Black Friday and other shopping holidays for the deals and variety of huge brand name stores like Target and Dick's Sporting Goods, and smaller stores like Francesca's and Blue Mercury.  Two New Urbanism communities are under construction, including [[Watkins Mill Town Center]] (Casey East and West), and the massive \"Science City\".  The state has a [[bus rapid transit]] line, Corridor Cities Transitway or \"CCT\", planned for the western portion of the city starting at Shady Grove Metro Station and connecting all the high density western Gaithersburg neighborhoods with a total of eight stops planned in the city.\n\nThe [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) is headquartered in Gaithersburg directly west of I-270.{{refn|Although NIST's mailing address states Gaithersburg, and the City of Gaithersburg surrounds NIST's property, the land where NIST is situated is not incorporated into the City of Gaithersburg.

The [[Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory]] is (as of 2007) the only [[National Historic Landmark]] in the City of Gaithersburg. The observatory and five others in [[Japan]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States]] gathered information that is still used by scientists today, along with information from [[satellites]], to determine [[polar motion]]; the size, shape, and physical properties of the earth; and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites. The Gaithersburg station operated until 1982 when computerization rendered the manual observation obsolete.\n\n===1960s===\nIn 1968, Gaithersburg was upgraded from a town to a city.\n\n===1970s===\nGaithersburg remained a predominantly rural farm town until the 1970s when more construction began.

During the late 1990s and 2000s, it had become one of the most economically and ethnically diverse areas in the [[Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area|Washington, D.C.

At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], Gaithersburg had a population of 59,933, making it the fourth-largest incorporated city in the state, behind [[Baltimore]], [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], and [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]].<ref>[https://www.census.gov U.S. Census website], U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved June 17, 2011.</ref> Gaithersburg is located to the northwest of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and is considered a suburb and a primary city within the [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington\u2013Arlington\u2013Alexandria, DC\u2013VA\u2013MD\u2013WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Gaithersburg was incorporated as a town in 1878 and as a city in 1968.\n\nGaithersburg is divided into east and west sections, separated by [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]]. The eastern section of the city is older and is the original portion of the town before more recent growth. Landmarks and buildings from that time can still be seen in many places but especially in the historic central business district of Gaithersburg called \"Olde Towne\". The east side also includes [[Lakeforest Mall]], City Hall, and the Montgomery County Fair grounds, and Bohrer Park (a well-known joint community recreation center and outdoor water park for kids and families). The west side of the city has many wealthier neighborhoods that were designed with smart growth techniques and embrace [[New Urbanism]].  These include the award-winning [[Kentlands]] community, the Lakelands community, and the Washingtonian Center (better known as Rio), a popular shopping/business district. Consumers often come to this area during Black Friday and other shopping holidays for the deals and variety of huge brand name stores like Target and Dick's Sporting Goods, and smaller stores like Francesca's and Blue Mercury.  Two New Urbanism communities are under construction, including [[Watkins Mill Town Center]] (Casey East and West), and the massive \"Science City\".  The state has a [[bus rapid transit]] line, Corridor Cities Transitway or \"CCT\", planned for the western portion of the city starting at Shady Grove Metro Station and connecting all the high density western Gaithersburg neighborhoods with a total of eight stops planned in the city.\n\nThe [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) is headquartered in Gaithersburg directly west of I-270.{{refn|Although NIST's mailing address states Gaithersburg, and the City of Gaithersburg surrounds NIST's property, the land where NIST is situated is not incorporated into the City of Gaithersburg. Instead, it is in an unincorporated part of Montgomery County. Owing to the manner in which land has been added to Gaithersburg over the years, there are multiple such unincorporated [[Enclave and exclave|enclaves]] within the perimeter; see the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050516070202/http://www.gaithersburgmd.gov:80/documents/zoning_3_2005.pdf City's Zoning Map] for details (3MB PDF).|group=N}} Other major employers in the city include [[IBM]], [[Lockheed Martin]] Information Systems and Global Services business area headquarters, [[AstraZeneca]], and the French [[multinational corporation]], [[Sodexo]].

The [[Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory]] is (as of 2007) the only [[National Historic Landmark]] in the City of Gaithersburg. The observatory and five others in [[Japan]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States]] gathered information that is still used by scientists today, along with information from [[satellites]], to determine [[polar motion]]; the size, shape, and physical properties of the earth; and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites.
