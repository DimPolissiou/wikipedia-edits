Its participants included politicians and political activists on both sides, the [[abertzale left]] (Basque nationalist left) and the Spanish government, and the security forces of Spain and France fighting against ETA and other small organizations, usually involved in the [[kale borroka]] (Basque youth guerrilla violence).

Nowadays, this area roughly belongs to three different political structures: the [[Basque autonomous community]], also known as Euskadi, and [[Navarre]] in Spain, and the three Northern Basque historical provinces ([[Labourd]], [[Lower Navarre]] and [[Soule]]), administratively part of the French department of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques. Approximately 3,000,000 people [[Basque Country (greater region)#Demographics|live in the Basque Country]].\n\n[[Basque people]] have managed to preserve their own identifying characteristics such as their own [[Basque culture|culture]] and [[Basque language|language]] throughout the centuries and today a large part of the population shares a collective consciousness and a [[Basque nationalism|desire to be self-governed]], either with further political autonomy or full independence. For instance, the football club [[Athletic Bilbao]], maintains a [[Athletic Bilbao signing policy|signing policy]] of only recruiting Basque born or raised players. Over the centuries, the Basque Country has maintained various levels of political [[self-governance]] under different Spanish political frameworks.

The war ended with the victory of the nationalist forces, with General [[Francisco Franco]] establishing a dictatorship that lasted for almost four decades.

Since then, the conflict resulted in the deaths of more than 1,000 people, including police and [[security officer]]s, members of the armed forces, Spanish politicians, journalists and civilians and some ETA members.

They want this question to be addressed with the same imagination and courage as the British and Irish governments used in talking to the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]].\n\nHowever, even raising this issue has become almost taboo among most Spaniards. They regard the Basque country, in the words of one pro-Spanish Basque politician I have interviewed, as \u201cnot just a part of Spain, but the heart of Spain.\u201d<ref name=\"NYT1\"/>}}\n\nAccording to Gaizka Fern\u00e1ndez Soldevilla, the narrative of the existence of a secular conflict between Basques and Spaniards has been one of the most used tropes by ETA and the abertzale left as pretext for the activity of the former.{{Sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Soldevilla|2016|pp=43-45}} Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e9rez P\u00e9rez points out that the perception of a war between an occupying Spain and a basque people defender of the basque liberties and victim of genocide would have served as justifying framework of the ETA armed activity.{{Sfn|P\u00e9rez P\u00e9rez|2015|pp=94-95}} According to Luis Castells and Fernando Molina the formulation of the existence of two symmetric violences, that would allow for a split of responsibilities between ETA and the states of Spain and France, carrying therefore a dilution of the responsibility of ETA, is a narrative heavily espoused by the Abertzale left, that also would present ETA as an inevitable historic response to the secular conflict.{{Sfn|Castells Arteche|Molina Aparicio|2013|p=225}} According to Fern\u00e1ndez Soldevilla, in spite of the end of the armed activity, the narrative of the basque conflict, fixed and divulgated by abertzale organic intellectuals such as historians Francisco Letamendia and Jose Mari Lorenzo, publicists such as I\u00f1aki Ega\u00f1a or Eduardo Renobales or journalists such as [[Luis N\u00fa\u00f1ez Astrain]],{{Sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Soldevilla|2016|p=48}} would be still useful as suggestive message in order to delegitimize the current democratic system, mixing victims with victimaries and equating the Basque case to real conflicts such as those of [[South Africa]] and [[Northern Ireland]].{{Sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Soldevilla|2016|p=56}}\n\nThis idea has been rejected, for example, by Jos\u00e9 Maria Ruiz Soroa<ref name=CanonNacionalista>{{cite book|last=Ruiz Soroa|first=Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda|title=El Canon Nacionalista|url=http://paralalibertad.org/wp-content/uploads/Ruiz_Soroa.pdf |language=Spanish |accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref> and by the main constitutionalist Spanish parties.

Nowadays, this area roughly belongs to three different political structures: the [[Basque autonomous community]], also known as Euskadi, and [[Navarre]] in Spain, and the three Northern Basque historical provinces ([[Labourd]], [[Lower Navarre]] and [[Soule]]), administratively part of the French department of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques. Approximately 3,000,000 people [[Basque Country (greater region)#Demographics|live in the Basque Country]].\n\n[[Basque people]] have managed to preserve their own identifying characteristics such as their own [[Basque culture|culture]] and [[Basque language|language]] throughout the centuries and today a large part of the population shares a collective consciousness and a [[Basque nationalism|desire to be self-governed]], either with further political autonomy or full independence. For instance, the football club [[Athletic Bilbao]], maintains a [[Athletic Bilbao signing policy|signing policy]] of only recruiting Basque born or raised players. Over the centuries, the Basque Country has maintained various levels of political [[self-governance]] under different Spanish political frameworks. Nowadays, Euskadi enjoys the highest level of self-governance of any nonstate entity within the European Union.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Autonomy games, tensions with the regions ahead of next March's general election in libia\n| url = http://www.economist.com/node/9833306?story_id=9833306| work = economist.com| date = 27 September 2007| accessdate = 1 November 2010}}</ref> However, tensions about the type of relationship the Basque territories should maintain with the Spanish authorities have existed since the origins of the Spanish state and in many cases have fuelled military confrontation, such as the [[Carlist Wars]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nFollowing the 1936 coup d'\u00e9tat that overthrew the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish republican government]], a civil war between [[Nationalist Spain|Spanish nationalist]] and republican forces broke out. Nearly all Basque nationalist forces, led by the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) sided with the Republic, even though Basque nationalists in \u00c1lava and Navarre fought along Basque Carlists on the side of Spanish nationalists. The war ended with the victory of the nationalist forces, with General [[Francisco Franco]] establishing a dictatorship that lasted for almost four decades. During [[Spanish state|Franco's dictatorship]], Basque language and culture were banned, institutions and political organisations abolished (to a lesser degree in Alava and Navarre), and people killed, tortured and imprisoned for their political beliefs.

Following the approval of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish constitution in 1978]], a [[Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country|Statute of Autonomy]] was promulgated and approved in referendum.

In the three provinces of the Basque Country, these figures were lower, with 70.2% voting in favour on a turnout of 44.7%. This was due to the call to abstention by EAJ-PNV and the creation of a coalition of Abertzale left organisations brought together to advocate for \"no\" in the [[Spanish constitutional referendum, 1978|referendum]], as they felt that the constitution did not meet their demands for independence.

One of the reasons that led to the [[23-F|coup d'\u00e9tat]] was the increase of ETA's violence. The coup failed after the King called for the military powers to obey the Constitution. Days after the coup, ETA's faction [[ETA political-military|politiko-militarra]] started its disbanding, with most of its members joining [[Euskadiko Ezkerra]], a leftist nationalist party away from the Abertzale left. [[Spanish general election, 1982|General elections]] were held in 1982, and [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]], from the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]] became the new president, while Herri Batasuna won two seats.

[[market town]] in [[Berkshire]], [[South East England]]. It is in the [[Thames Valley]] at the [[confluence]] of the [[River Thames]] and [[River Kennet]], and on both the [[Great Western Main Line]] railway and the [[M4 motorway]]. Reading is {{convert|70|mi|km}} east of [[Bristol]], {{convert|24|mi|km}} south of [[Oxford]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} west of London, {{convert|14|mi|km}} north of [[Basingstoke]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} south-west of [[Maidenhead]] and {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]].\n\nThe first evidence for Reading as a town dates from the 8th century. It was an important trading and ecclesiastical centre in the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period, as the site of [[Reading Abbey]], one of the largest and richest monasteries of medieval England with strong royal connections, of which the 12th-century abbey gateway and significant ancient ruins remain. By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth. The medieval town was seriously affected by the [[English Civil War]], with a major siege and loss of trade, and played a pivotal role in the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], with that revolution's only significant military action fought on the streets of the town. The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. The 19th century saw the coming of the [[Great Western Railway]] and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses. During that period, the town grew rapidly as a [[manufacturing]] centre.\n\nToday,{{when|date=August 2019}} Reading is a major commercial centre, with involvement in information technology and insurance, and despite its proximity to London, has a net inward commuter flow.

Some of these areas ([[Tilehurst]], [[Calcot, Berkshire|Calcot]], [[Earley]], [[Winnersh]] and [[Woodley, Berkshire|Woodley]]) are, at least partly, within [[West Berkshire]] or [[Wokingham Borough]]. This unusual configuration creates difficulties. The diminishing amount of land available and suitable for development within the borough's boundary can bring the council into conflict with its neighbours' development plans. This particularly affects education (many schools have catchment areas that cross administrative boundaries), and transport.

The centre of Reading is on a low ridge between the [[River Thames]] and [[River Kennet]], close to their [[confluence]], reflecting the town's history as a river port. Just above the confluence, the Kennet cuts through a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames [[flood plain]]. The absence of a flood plain on the Kennet in this [[defile (geography)|defile]] enabled the development of [[Wharf|wharves]].\n\nAs Reading has grown, its suburbs have spread: to the west between the two rivers into the foothills of the [[Berkshire Downs]] as far as [[Calcot, Berkshire|Calcot]], [[Tilehurst]] and [[Purley on Thames|Purley]]; to the south and south-east on the south side of the Kennet as far as [[Whitley Wood]], [[Lower Earley]] and [[Woodley, Berkshire|Woodley]]; and to the north of the Thames into the [[Chiltern Hills]] as far as [[Caversham Heights]], [[Emmer Green]] and [[Caversham Park Village]]. Outside the central area, the floors of the valleys containing the two rivers remain largely unimproved floodplain. Apart from the [[M4 motorway|M4]] curving to the south there is only one road across the Kennet flood plain.

The Reading town area, sometimes referred to as ''Greater Reading'', incorporates the town's eastern and western suburbs outside the borough, in the civil parishes of Earley, Woodley, Purley, Tilehurst and Shinfield.<ref name=\"ReadingTown\"/> This area had a population of 230,046 in 2018, with ONS recognising this definition (the USD) as the town of Reading.<ref name=\"ReadingTown\"/> The Reading urban area (officially Reading/Wokingham) additionally includes [[Winnersh]], [[Wokingham]] and [[Crowthorne]].\n\nLike the rest of the United Kingdom, Reading has a [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]], with limited seasonal temperature ranges and generally moderate rainfall throughout the year.

[[market town]] in [[Berkshire]], [[South East England]]. It is in the [[Thames Valley]] at the [[confluence]] of the [[River Thames]] and [[River Kennet]], and on both the [[Great Western Main Line]] railway and the [[M4 motorway]]. Reading is {{convert|70|mi|km}} east of [[Bristol]], {{convert|24|mi|km}} south of [[Oxford]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} west of London, {{convert|14|mi|km}} north of [[Basingstoke]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} south-west of [[Maidenhead]] and {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]].\n\nThe first evidence for Reading as a town dates from the 8th century. It was an important trading and ecclesiastical centre in the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period, as the site of [[Reading Abbey]], one of the largest and richest monasteries of medieval England with strong royal connections, of which the 12th-century abbey gateway and significant ancient ruins remain. By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth. The medieval town was seriously affected by the [[English Civil War]], with a major siege and loss of trade, and played a pivotal role in the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], with that revolution's only significant military action fought on the streets of the town. The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. The 19th century saw the coming of the [[Great Western Railway]] and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses. During that period, the town grew rapidly as a [[manufacturing]] centre.\n\nToday,{{when|date=August 2019}} Reading is a major commercial centre, with involvement in information technology and insurance, and despite its proximity to London, has a net inward commuter flow. It is ranked the UK's top economic area for economic success and wellbeing, according to factors such as employment, health, income and skills.<ref name=\"Good Growth for Cities 2013\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.co.uk/government-public-sector/good-growth/good-growth-for-cities-report-on-economic-wellbeing-uk-urban-areas.jhtml|title=Government & public sector|work=PwC}}</ref> Reading is also a major regional retail centre serving a large area of the Thames Valley, and is home to the [[University of Reading]]. Every year it hosts the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]], one of England's biggest music festivals. Sporting teams based in Reading include [[Reading F.C.|Reading Football Club]], [[Reading City F.C.]] and [[London Irish]] rugby union team, and over 15,000 runners annually compete in the [[Reading Half Marathon]].\n\nIn 2018, Reading had a population of 230,046<ref name=\"ReadingTown\">{{cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/southeastengland/reading/E35001501__reading/|title=Reading (Reading, South East England, United Kingdom) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information|website=City Population|accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref> and the wider [[Reading/Wokingham Urban Area|urban area]] had 337,108 inhabitants,<ref name=\"ReadingUA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/cities/englandua/?cityid=7246|title=United Kingdom: Urban Areas in England - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information|website=City Population|accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref> while the smaller [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority area]] covered by the '''Borough of Reading''' had 163,203 residents.<ref name=\"ReadingUnitary\">{{cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/admin/reading/E06000038__reading/|title=Reading (Unitary District, Reading, United Kingdom) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information|website=City Population|accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref> The borough is represented in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] by [[Reading East (UK Parliament constituency)|two]] [[Reading West (UK Parliament constituency)|members]], and has been continuously represented there since 1295.

The name probably comes from the ''[[Readingas]]'', an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] tribe whose name means ''Reada's People'' in [[Old English]],{{sfn|Cameron|1961|p=64}} or less probably the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] ''Rhydd-Inge'', meaning ''Ford over the River''.<ref name=rbhreading>{{cite web |url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/villages/reading.html |title=History of Reading, Berkshire |author=Ford, David Nash |year=2001 |work=Royal Berkshire History |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |accessdate=28 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122144845/http://www.berkshirehistory.com/villages/reading.html |archive-date=22 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In late 870, an army of [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] invaded the kingdom of [[Wessex]] and set up camp at Reading. On 4 January 871, in the [[Battle of Reading (871)|first Battle of Reading]], [[Ethelred of Wessex|King Ethelred]] and his brother [[Alfred the Great]] attempted unsuccessfully to breach the Danes' defences. The battle is described in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', and that account provides the earliest known written record of the existence of Reading. The Danes remained in Reading until late in 871, when they retreated to their winter quarters in London.{{sfn|Phillips|1980|p=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342\u2013364}}\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the [[Norman conquest of England]], [[William the Conqueror]] gave land in and around Reading to his foundation of [[Battle Abbey]]. In its 1086 [[Domesday Book]] listing, the town was explicitly described as a [[borough]]. The presence of six mills is recorded: four on land belonging to the king and two on the land given to Battle Abbey.{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342\u2013364}} [[Reading Abbey]] was founded in 1121 by [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], who is buried within the Abbey grounds.

Historically, the town of Reading was smaller than the borough. Definitions include the old [[ecclesiastical parish]]es of the churches of [[Reading Minster|St Mary]], [[St Laurence's Church, Reading|St Laurence]] and [[St Giles' Church, Reading|St Giles]], or the even smaller pre-19th century borough.{{sfn|Dils|1998}} Today, as well as the town centre Reading comprises a number of suburbs and other districts, both within the borough itself and within the surrounding urban area. The names and location of these suburbs are in general usage but, except where some of the outer suburbs correspond to civil parishes, there are no formally defined boundaries. The Reading town area, sometimes referred to as ''Greater Reading'', incorporates the town's eastern and western suburbs outside the borough, in the civil parishes of Earley, Woodley, Purley, Tilehurst and Shinfield.<ref name=\"ReadingTown\"/> This area had a population of 230,046 in 2018, with ONS recognising this definition (the USD) as the town of Reading.<ref name=\"ReadingTown\"/> The Reading urban area (officially Reading/Wokingham) additionally includes [[Winnersh]], [[Wokingham]] and [[Crowthorne]].\n\nLike the rest of the United Kingdom, Reading has a [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]], with limited seasonal temperature ranges and generally moderate rainfall throughout the year. The nearest official [[Met Office]] weather station is located at the Reading University Atmospheric Observatory on the [[Whiteknights Park|Whiteknights Campus]], which has recorded atmospheric

It is located in [[Callao]], 11&nbsp;kilometers (7&nbsp;mi) from [[Historic Centre of Lima|Lima]], the nation's capital city and 17&nbsp;km (11&nbsp;mi) from [[Miraflores District, Lima|Miraflores]]. During 2017, the airport served 22,025,704 passengers. Historically, the airport was the hub for [[Faucett Per\u00fa|Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aviaci\u00f3n Faucett]] and [[Aeroperu|Aeroper\u00fa]]. Now it serves as a [[airline hub|hub]] for many aviation companies. The airport was named after Peruvian aviator [[Jorge Ch\u00e1vez]] (1887 - 1910).\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Douglas C-54G OB-R-894 SATCO Lima 20.04.72 edited-3.jpg|thumb|200px|Lima Airport in 1972 with a SATCO [[Douglas DC-4]] operating an internal flight|left]]\n\nLima's first airport was the [[Limatambo International Airport|Limatambo Airport]] in San Isidro. It ceased operations in 1960 due to a lack of space and capacity, and was replaced by the Lima-Callao International Airport. In June 1965, the Lima-Callao airport was renamed the \"Aeropuerto Internacional Jorge Ch\u00e1vez\" after the famous Peruvian aviator, Jorge Ch\u00e1vez Dartnell. In December 1965, the terminal building was officially opened.\n\nWhen it was in operation, [[Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aviaci\u00f3n Faucett]] had its corporate headquarters on the airport grounds.<ref>{{cite web |last1=PDFarchive |title=Flightglobal/view/1995/1995 |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1995/1995%20-%200749.html |website=www.flightglobal.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, in order to improve and expand its infrastructure, the government of Peru placed the airport under the management of [[Lima Airport Partners]] (LAP). LAP is now composed of [[Fraport]] and two other minor partners. The air traffic control is managed by the Peruvian Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation ([[CORPAC]]). The Peruvian government engaged Jaime Malag\u00f3n, Jerome Jakubik, Paul Slocomb, and [[V\u00edctor M. Marroqu\u00edn]] of Baker and McKenzie international law firm, to oversee the changes.\n\n==Expansion==\n[[File:LIM terminal.jpg|thumb|right|Main terminal]]\nIn February 2005, the first phase of a new renovation and expansion project was completed. This included the Peru Plaza Shopping Center and a new [[concourse]]. In June 2007, a four-star hotel, [[Ramada]] Costa del Sol, opened at the airport.\n\nIn January 2009, the second phase of the terminal expansion was commenced. The terminal has 28 gates, 19 with [[jet bridge|boarding bridges]]. In August 2009, the LAP announced that in 2010, the airport would have a new [[Instrument Landing System]] (ILS CAT III) to help with fog landings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livinginperu.com/news-9808-advice-peru-lima-airport-to-reach-category-iii-in-2010-with-fog-assist-landing|title=Peru this Week|accessdate=4 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918124057/http://www.livinginperu.com/news-9808-advice-peru-lima-airport-to-reach-category-iii-in-2010-with-fog-assist-landing|archivedate=18 September 2009}}</ref> 'Arquitectonica\", a Miami-based architectural office and Lima Airport Partners planned a second terminal and expansion of the main terminal.\n\nOn October 24, 2018, the Peruvian state delivered all the land for the expansion and modernization of the Jorge Chavez airport to the airport operator \"Lima Airport Partners\".\nThe estimated investment of 1,200 million USD includes the construction of a new runway, a control tower and a passenger terminal in addition to the existing one.\nOn the other hand, the state will build a new bridge and highway on the current Santa Rosa avenue that will connect directly with the \"costa verde\" highway. \nWorks will be completed in 4 years, by the beginning of the year 2023, and will allow the transist of 40 million passengers per year by 2030.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://tnews.com.pe/vizcarra-hace-entrega-de-terrenos-en-jorge-chavez-y-asegura-anunciadas-inversiones/ |title = VIZCARRA HACE ENTREGA DE TERRENOS EN JORGE CHAVEZ y ASEGURA ANUNCIADAS INVERSIONES &#124; T News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://rpp.pe/economia/economia/aeropuerto-jorge-chavez-cuando-podras-disfrutar-de-la-ampliacion-del-aeropuerto-jorge-chavez-noticia-1158957 | title=Aeropuerto Jorge Ch\u00e1vez &#124; \u00bfCu\u00e1ndo podr\u00e1s disfrutar de la ampliaci\u00f3n del Aeropuerto Jorge Ch\u00e1vez?}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://gestion.pe/economia/ampliacion-jorge-chavez-permitira-transito-40-millones-pasajeros-2030-nndc-248041 |title = Ampliaci\u00f3n del Jorge Ch\u00e1vez permitir\u00e1 tr\u00e1nsito de 40 millones de pasajeros en 2030|date = 2018-10-24}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\nFrom 2010 to 2012, the LAP received the annual Best Airport in South America 2010 award from [[Skytrax]].<ref>[http://www.worldairportawards.com/Awards_2010/bestairport_samerica.htm Lima Airport: Best Airport in South America 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222151541/http://worldairportawards.com/Awards_2010/bestairport_samerica.htm |date=2010-12-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/economia/659143/noticia-jorge-chavez-aeropuerto-lider-sudamerica-2010-segunthe-wall-street-journal|title=Jorge Ch\u00e1vez es el Aeropuerto L\u00edder en Sudam\u00e9rica 2010, seg\u00fan \"The Wall Street Journal\"|author=El Comercio|date=4 June 2015|work=EL COMERCIO|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airlinequality.com/|title=Airline Rating and Reviews \u2013 Airport Rating and Reviews \u2013 Seat Reviews|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.worldairportawards.com/Awards_2012/bestairport_samerica.htm World Travel Awards 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422175244/http://worldairportawards.com/Awards_2012/bestairport_samerica.htm |date=2012-04-22 }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peru.com/2012/04/20/actualidad/economia-y-finanzas/aeropuerto-jorge-chavez-fue-elegido-mejor-sudamerica-cuarta-vez-noticia-59807|title=Aeropuerto Jorge Ch\u00e1vez fue elegido el mejor de Sudam\u00e9rica por cuarta vez|work=Per\u00fa.com|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=2012-04-20}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, the Sumaq VIP lounge at the airport received its second annual [[Priority Pass]] \"Lounge of the Year 2010\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prioritypass.com/|title=Airport Lounge Access Worldwide \u2013 Priority Pass|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vipclub.com.pe/ingles/la_empresa.htm|title=VIP Club|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prioritypass.com/Press/Priority-Pass-Lounge-of-the-Year-2010.cfm|title=Priority Pass Lounge of the Year 2010 \u2013 Recent News of Interest \u2013 Priority Pass|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/lima/446067/noticia-sala-vip-aeropuerto-jorge-chavez-fue-elegida-mejor-mundo-viajeros|title=La sala vip del aeropuerto Jorge Ch\u00e1vez fue elegida la mejor del mundo por viajeros|author=El Comercio|date=4 June 2015|work=EL COMERCIO|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/economia/462985/noticia-conozca-sala-vip-aeropuerto-jorge-chavez-mejor-mundo|title=Conozca la sala vip del aeropuerto Jorge Ch\u00e1vez, la mejor del mundo|author=El Comercio|date=4 June 2015|work=EL COMERCIO|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n{{update|section|date=March 2020}}\nTransportation between the airport and the city is provided by taxis, tour buses and vans.

It ceased operations in 1960 due to a lack of space and capacity, and was replaced by the Lima-Callao International Airport. In June 1965, the Lima-Callao airport was renamed the \"Aeropuerto Internacional Jorge Ch\u00e1vez\" after the famous Peruvian aviator, Jorge Ch\u00e1vez Dartnell. In December 1965, the terminal building was officially opened.\n\nWhen it was in operation, [[Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aviaci\u00f3n Faucett]] had its corporate headquarters on the airport grounds.<ref>{{cite web |last1=PDFarchive |title=Flightglobal/view/1995/1995 |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1995/1995%20-%200749.html |website=www.flightglobal.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, in order to improve and expand its infrastructure, the government of Peru placed the airport under the management of [[Lima Airport Partners]] (LAP). LAP is now composed of [[Fraport]] and two other minor partners. The air traffic control is managed by the Peruvian Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation ([[CORPAC]]). The Peruvian government engaged Jaime Malag\u00f3n, Jerome Jakubik, Paul Slocomb, and [[V\u00edctor M.

This included the Peru Plaza Shopping Center and a new [[concourse]]. In June 2007, a four-star hotel, [[Ramada]] Costa del Sol, opened at the airport.\n\nIn January 2009, the second phase of the terminal expansion was commenced. The terminal has 28 gates, 19 with [[jet bridge|boarding bridges]].
