However, if a modern E-segment sedan by a European brand is sold in the U.S., it invariably falls into the category of a [[Mid-size car|mid-size]] sedan, usually a mid-size luxury sedan.

As European segments denote both size and equipment level, American full-size cars that are not luxury cars simply do not belong to any of the European segments. Considering length only, they would always fall into the F-segment or even exceed its dimensions - with a possible exception of the 2018 Toyota Avalon which may or may not be short enough to be considered E-segment (this is as of 2019).</ref> spans both the [[D-segment]] and the E-segment.

The main route is the service to [[Almaty]], operated by both [[FlyArystan]] and [[SCAT Airlines]].\n\nThe airport is managed by Airport Management Group (AMG), a [[government-owned corporation]] that manages almost all public airports in Kazakhstan. The facility opened in {{start date and age|1945|}} as '''Kokchetav-Trofimovka Airport''' and was commonly known as '''Kokchetav Airport''' (the airport's current [[IATA code]], '''KOV''', is derived from the city's previous name of [[Kokchetav]]).\n\n==Location==\nKokshetau Airport is {{Convert|12.5|km|abbr=on|lk=in}} north-east of [[Kokshetau]] city centre. It is bordered by the village of Kyzyltan to the east, Myrzakolsor [[lake]] to the north, Stantsionnyi village to the west, and the village of Akkol to the south. It is primarily served by the [[Roads in Kazakhstan|National Road A13]], however it is also accessible via the nearby [[Roads in Kazakhstan|A1]] or [[Roads in Kazakhstan|A343]] motorways.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nThe facility opened in {{start date and age|1945|}} and was formerly known as '''Kokchetav-Trofimovka Airport''', Trofimovka (now Kaindy) was the name of the neighbouring village and  Kokshetau was known as Kokchetav at the time.\n\nKokshetau Airport served as a [[Airline hub|hub]] for [[Air Kokshetau]] from 2002 to 2008. In 2004, [[Aero Flight]], a German airline, was operating international non-stop seasonal service between June and August from [[Frankfurt]] ([[IATA]]: '''FRA'''), [[Germany]] to [[Kokshetau]].<ref name=\"routesonline.com\">{{cite web |title= Transaero Boosts Flights Between Russia and Kazakhstan|url= https://www.routesonline.com/news/29/breaking-news/231647/transaero-boosts-flights-between-russia-and-kazakhstan/?highlight=kokshetau|accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Recent years===\n[[File:FlyArystan_at_Kokshetau_International_Airport.jpg|left|thumb|296px|[[FlyArystan]] flights leave from Kokshetau International Airport 3 times per week.]]\n\nIn 2010, the airport underwent major reconstruction, including reconstruction of the passenger terminal building and modernization of the runway.
