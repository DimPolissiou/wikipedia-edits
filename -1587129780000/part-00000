The Palmach was established on 15 May 1941. By the outbreak of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|Israeli War of Independence]] it consisted of over 2,000 men and women in three fighting [[brigade]]s and auxiliary aerial, naval and intelligence units. With the creation of Israel's army, the three Palmach Brigades were disbanded.

Its members formed the backbone of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] high command for many years, and were prominent in Israeli politics, literature and culture.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 782 Women of the PALMACH at Ein Gedi \u05d1\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e4\u05dc\u05dequot;\u05d7 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d2\u05d3\u05d9.jpg|thumb|Women of the Palmach at [[Ein Gedi]], 1942]]\nThe Palmach was established by the [[Haganah]] High Command on 14 May 1941. Its aim was to defend the Palestinian Jewish community against two potential threats. Firstly the occupation of Palestine by the [[Axis powers|Axis]] in the event of their victory over the British in North Africa. Secondly, if the British army were to retreat from Palestine, Jewish settlements might come under attack from the Arab population. [[Yitzhak Sadeh]] was named as Palmach commander.<ref>Yigal Allon, ''Shield of David'', {{ISBN|978-0-297-00133-1}}, 1970. p. 117</ref> Initially the group consisted of around one hundred men. In the early summer of 1941 the British military authorities agreed to joint operations against [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces in [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]].  The first action was a sabotage mission against oil installations at [[Tripoli, Lebanon]].  Twenty-three Palmach members and a British liaison officer set out by sea but were never heard of again.<ref>Allon, pp. 118, 119.</ref> On 8 June mixed squads of Palmach and Australians began [[Syria\u2013Lebanon Campaign|operating in Lebanon and Syria]].  The success of these operations led the British GHQ to fund a sabotage training camp for three hundred men at [[Mishmar HaEmek]]. Since the Palmach consisted of unpaid volunteers, the funding was used to cover the needs of twice that number of men.<ref>Allon, p. 121.</ref> When the British ordered the dismantling of Palmach after the Allied victory at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in 1942, the organization went underground.\n\n==Underground==\n[[File:Almog IL8 Betkeshet.jpg|thumb|[[Beit Keshet]], First Palmach outpost, 1944]]\n\nSince British funding had stopped, [[Yitzhak Tabenkin]], head of the kibbutz union [[HaKibbutz HaMeuhad]], suggested the Palmach could be self-funding by having its members work in the kibbutzim. Each kibbutz would host a Palmach [[platoon]] and supply them with food, homes and resources. In return the platoon would safeguard the kibbutz and carry out work such as [[agriculture|agricultural]] work.<ref>Allon, pp. 126, 127.</ref> The proposal was accepted in August 1942, when it was also decided that each month Palmach members would have eight training days, 14 work days and seven days off. The program of combined [[military]] training, [[agriculture|agricultural]] work and Zionist education was called \"Hach'shara Meguyeset\" \u05d4\u05db\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05de\u05d2\u05d5\u05d9\u05e1\u05ea (meaning \"Drafted/Recruited Training\"). Later, Zionist youth movements offered members aged of 18\u201320 an opportunity to join core groups ([[gar'in]]) for agricultural settlement that became the basis for the [[Nahal]].\n\nBasic training included [[physical fitness]], [[small arms]], [[m\u00eal\u00e9e]] and [[KAPAP]], basic [[marine training]], [[topography]], [[first aid]] and [[squad operations]].  Most of the Palmach members received advanced training in one or more of the following areas: [[sabotage]] and [[explosive]]s, [[reconnaissance]], [[sniper|sniping]], [[communication]]s and [[radio]], light and medium [[machine gun]]s, and operating [[2-inch mortar|2-inch]] and [[Ordnance ML 3 inch mortar|3-inch mortars]].  Platoon training included long marches, combined live-fire drills with artillery support and machine guns and mortars.\n\nThe Palmach put great emphasis on training independent and broadminded [[Palmach#The image of the Hebrew commander in the Palmach|field commanders]] who would take the initiative and set an example for their troops.  It trained squad commanders and company commanders.  The major commanders training course was in the Palmach and many [[Haganah]] commanders were sent to be trained in the Palmach.  The Palmach commanders' course was the source for many field commanders, who were the backbone of [[Haganah]] and, later, the [[Israel Defense Forces]].\n\n==Post World War II Operations==\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 20707 The Palmach.jpg|thumb|Small arms training of B Company]]\n{{Main|Jewish insurgency in Palestine}} \nFor seven months after the assassination of [[Lord Moyne]], members of the Palmach under the command of [[Shimon Avidan]] were involved in the [[The Hunting Season|Saison]] Operation, in which they cooperated with the British in an attempt to crush the [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Stern Gang]].<ref>Eric Silver, ''Begin, A Biography''. 1984, {{ISBN|0-297-78399-8}}. p. 51.</ref> But with [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s decision, 1 October 1945, to launch an armed struggle against the British, the Palmach entered an alliance with the dissident groups, called [[Jewish Resistance Movement|The Hebrew Resistance Movement]].<ref name=\"auto\">Silver, p. 64.</ref> On 10 October 1945 a force led by [[Yitzhak Rabin]] [[Atlit detainee camp|raided the prison at Atlit]] freeing 208 Jewish prisoners.

The breakaway group, which evolved into Mapam, were inspired by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] regime in the [[Soviet Union]], and had a strong following in the kibbutz movement. Since most of the Palmach's members came from the kibbutzim, the Mapam dominated the Palmach, with a majority of its officers being members.<ref>Peri, p. 47. Five Brigade Commanders and its Commanding Officer Yigal Allon were members.</ref> After 1948 Ben-Gurion, Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of the new state, had a series of confrontations with leaders of the Haganah and the Palmach. In a process that Ben-Gurion described as de-politicizing the army, the three Palmach brigades were disbanded and in 1950 most of the Mapam officers resigned. Those Palmach members who had been in Mapam and remained in the army had to endure several years on the margins. The effect of the de-politicizing was that all senior army posts were held by Mapai members or Ben-Gurion loyalists.<ref>Peri, p. 62. Those who stayed: Yitzhak Rabin, Haim BarLev, David Elazar.</ref> After demobilization many Palmach members founded new kibbutzim. In 1949 they set up [[Bar'am]], [[Beit Guvrin, Israel|Beit Guvrin]], [[Nir Yitzhak]] (named in honour of Yitzhak Sadeh), [[Palmachim]], [[Re'im]], [[Rosh HaNikra (kibbutz)|Rosh HaNikra]], [[Re'im]] and [[Yir'on]]. Palmach members were not, however, a unified, homogeneous collective with a single ideology. In the early years of the state of Israel they could be found in all political parties.\n\nYigal Allon, considered by many to be the representative of the Palmach generation, never reached a position of national leadership although he was Prime Minister for a few days between [[Levi Eshkol|Eshkol's]] death and [[Golda Meir|Meir's]] appointment in 1969. He died in 1980.\n\nBesides military contributions, the Palmach had great influence over the Israeli \"[[Sabra (person)|Tzabar]]\" culture. Palmach activities included \"Kumzitz\" (sitting around a fire at night, eating, talking and having fun), public singing and cross-country walking trips. These often took on mythical proportions and have become favorite activities for Israelis.\n\nThe Palmach also contributed many anecdotes, jokes, \"chizbat\" (short funny tales, often based on exaggerations), songs and even books and stories.\n\nNotable Palmach cultural figures include:\n* [[Yehuda Amichai]] \u2013 poet\n* [[Dahn Ben-Amotz]] \u2013 writer, journalist\n* [[Netiva Ben-Yehuda]] \u2013 journalist, writer, radio host\n* [[Haim Hefer]] \u2013 poet, writer\n* [[Haim Gouri]] \u2013 poet, writer\n* [[Shaike Ophir]] \u2013 actor\n* [[Moshe Shamir]] \u2013 writer, playwright\n* [[Hannah Szenes]] (Senesh) \u2013 poet\n* [[Vidal Sassoon]] \u2013 British hairdresser\n\n== Palmach song ==\nFull text of the song:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hebrewsongs.com/?song=shirhapalmach|title=Lyrics of the song|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|D0GqLBlgErU|Palmach song performed by an Israeli orchestra}}</ref>\n\n{|cellspacing=\"10\" rules=\"cols\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|First Stanza\n|-\n|\n\u05de\u05e1\u05d1\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e1\u05e2\u05e8,<br />\n\u05d0\u05da \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e9\u05d7<br />\n\u05dc\u05e4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5,<br />\n\u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d5, \u05d0\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d4\u05e4\u05dc\u05de\"\u05d7.<br />\n| \n''Though the storm is ever mounting''<br />\n''Still our heads remain unbowed.''<br />\n''We are ready to obey all commands,''<br />\n''The Palmach will win - we've vowed.''<br />\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Second Stanza\n|-\n|\n\u05de\u05de\u05d8\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e2\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e0\u05d2\u05d1,<br />\n\u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05e2\u05d3 \u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 <br />\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d1\u05d7\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 - \u05dc\u05e0\u05e9\u05e7<br />\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d1\u05d7\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05de\u05e8!<br />\n|\n''From Metulla to the Negev,''<br />\n''From the desert to the plain,''<br />\n''All our youth defend the homeland,''<br />\n''Till we bring it peace again.''<br />\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Third Stanza\n|-\n|\n\u05e0\u05ea\u05d9\u05d1 \u05dc\u05e0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d1\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd,<br />\n\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05dc \u05dc\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, -<br />\n\u05de\u05d5\u05dc \u05d0\u05d5\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d3\u05e8\u05db\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d9\u05e2\u05dc,<br />\n\u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05e6\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd.<br />\n|\n''In the eagle's path we follow,<br />\n''Over mountain tracks we go,''<br />\n''Among stony heights and caverns''<br />\n''We are seeking out the foe.''<br />\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Fourth Stanza\n|-\n|\n\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5,<br />\n\u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d5\u05d1\u05de\u05d7\u05e9\u05da<br />\n\u05dc\u05e4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5,<br />\n\u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d5, \u05d0\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d4\u05e4\u05dc\u05de\"\u05d7.<br />\n|\n''When you summon us to battle,''<br />\n''We will be there first by day or night,''<br />\n''We are ready when you give the command,''<br />\n''The Palmach will march in might.''<br />\n|}\n\n== Notable Palmachniks ==\n;High command:\n* [[Eliyahu Golomb]] \u2013 general commander of [[Haganah]]\n* [[Yitzhak Sadeh]] \u2013 first general commander of Palmach\n* [[Yigal Allon]] \u2013 second general commander of Palmach (1945\u20131948)\n* [[Giora Shanan]] \u2013 lieutenant general deputy commander of the Palmach\n* [[David Nameri]] \u2013 lieutenant general commander of the Palmach\n* [[Yohanan Ratner]] \u2013 strategy officer\n* [[Moshe Bar-Tikva]] \u2013 training officer\n* [[Yitzhak Rabin]] \u2013 brigade commander; Allon's second in command\n* [[Moshe Kelman]] \u2013 3rd Battalion commander\n;Special units commanders:\n* [[Shimon Avidan]] \u2013 commander of the \"German Department\"\n* [[Israel Ben-Yehuda]] \u2013 commander of the \"Arab Department\"\n* [[Yigal Allon]] \u2013 commander of the \"Syrian Department\"\n;[[Company (military unit)|Company]] commanders (as of 1943):\n* [[Yigal Allon]], [[Zalman Mars]] \u2013 Pluga Aleph commanders\n* [[Moshe Dayan]], [[Meir Davidson]], [[Uri Brenner]] \u2013 Pluga Beth commanders\n* [[Uri Yafeh]] \u2013 Pluga Gimel commander\n* [[Benjamin Goldstein Tzur]] \u2013 Pluga Dalet commander\n* [[Abraham Negev]] \u2013 Pluga Hey commander\n* [[Israel Livertovski]], [[Shimon Avidan]] \u2013 Pluga Vav commander\n* [[Yehuda.

The Palmach was established on 15 May 1941. By the outbreak of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|Israeli War of Independence]] it consisted of over 2,000 men and women in three fighting [[brigade]]s and auxiliary aerial, naval and intelligence units. With the creation of Israel's army, the three Palmach Brigades were disbanded. This and political reasons compelled many of the senior Palmach officers to resign in 1950.<ref>{{cite book|first=Yoram|last=Peri|title=Between battles and ballots \u2013 Israeli military in politics|publisher=CUP|date=1983|isbn=0-521-24414-5|ref=p. 61|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/betweenbattlesba0000peri}}</ref>\n\nThe Palmach contributed significantly to Israeli culture and ethos, well beyond its military contribution.

Its aim was to defend the Palestinian Jewish community against two potential threats. Firstly the occupation of Palestine by the [[Axis powers|Axis]] in the event of their victory over the British in North Africa. Secondly, if the British army were to retreat from Palestine, Jewish settlements might come under attack from the Arab population. [[Yitzhak Sadeh]] was named as Palmach commander.<ref>Yigal Allon, ''Shield of David'', {{ISBN|978-0-297-00133-1}}, 1970. p. 117</ref> Initially the group consisted of around one hundred men. In the early summer of 1941 the British military authorities agreed to joint operations against [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces in [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]].  The first action was a sabotage mission against oil installations at [[Tripoli, Lebanon]].  Twenty-three Palmach members and a British liaison officer set out by sea but were never heard of again.<ref>Allon, pp. 118, 119.</ref> On 8 June mixed squads of Palmach and Australians began [[Syria\u2013Lebanon Campaign|operating in Lebanon and Syria]].  The success of these operations led the British GHQ to fund a sabotage training camp for three hundred men at [[Mishmar HaEmek]]. Since the Palmach consisted of unpaid volunteers, the funding was used to cover the needs of twice that number of men.<ref>Allon, p. 121.</ref> When the British ordered the dismantling of Palmach after the Allied victory at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in 1942, the organization went underground.\n\n==Underground==\n[[File:Almog IL8 Betkeshet.jpg|thumb|[[Beit Keshet]], First Palmach outpost, 1944]]\n\nSince British funding had stopped, [[Yitzhak Tabenkin]], head of the kibbutz union [[HaKibbutz HaMeuhad]], suggested the Palmach could be self-funding by having its members work in the kibbutzim. Each kibbutz would host a Palmach [[platoon]] and supply them with food, homes and resources. In return the platoon would safeguard the kibbutz and carry out work such as [[agriculture|agricultural]] work.<ref>Allon, pp. 126, 127.</ref> The proposal was accepted in August 1942, when it was also decided that each month Palmach members would have eight training days, 14 work days and seven days off. The program of combined [[military]] training, [[agriculture|agricultural]] work and Zionist education was called \"Hach'shara Meguyeset\" \u05d4\u05db\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05de\u05d2\u05d5\u05d9\u05e1\u05ea (meaning \"Drafted/Recruited Training\"). Later, Zionist youth movements offered members aged of 18\u201320 an opportunity to join core groups ([[gar'in]]) for agricultural settlement that became the basis for the [[Nahal]].\n\nBasic training included [[physical fitness]], [[small arms]], [[m\u00eal\u00e9e]] and [[KAPAP]], basic [[marine training]], [[topography]], [[first aid]] and [[squad operations]].  Most of the Palmach members received advanced training in one or more of the following areas: [[sabotage]] and [[explosive]]s, [[reconnaissance]], [[sniper|sniping]], [[communication]]s and [[radio]], light and medium [[machine gun]]s, and operating [[2-inch mortar|2-inch]] and [[Ordnance ML 3 inch mortar|3-inch mortars]].  Platoon training included long marches, combined live-fire drills with artillery support and machine guns and mortars.\n\nThe Palmach put great emphasis on training independent and broadminded [[Palmach#The image of the Hebrew commander in the Palmach|field commanders]] who would take the initiative and set an example for their troops.  It trained squad commanders and company commanders.  The major commanders training course was in the Palmach and many [[Haganah]] commanders were sent to be trained in the Palmach.  The Palmach commanders' course was the source for many field commanders, who were the backbone of [[Haganah]] and, later, the [[Israel Defense Forces]].\n\n==Post World War II Operations==\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 20707 The Palmach.jpg|thumb|Small arms training of B Company]]\n{{Main|Jewish insurgency in Palestine}} \nFor seven months after the assassination of [[Lord Moyne]], members of the Palmach under the command of [[Shimon Avidan]] were involved in the [[The Hunting Season|Saison]] Operation, in which they cooperated with the British in an attempt to crush the [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Stern Gang]].<ref>Eric Silver, ''Begin, A Biography''. 1984, {{ISBN|0-297-78399-8}}. p. 51.</ref> But with [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s decision, 1 October 1945, to launch an armed struggle against the British, the Palmach entered an alliance with the dissident groups, called [[Jewish Resistance Movement|The Hebrew Resistance Movement]].<ref name=\"auto\">Silver, p. 64.</ref> On 10 October 1945 a force led by [[Yitzhak Rabin]] [[Atlit detainee camp|raided the prison at Atlit]] freeing 208 Jewish prisoners.

At the beginning of the war, Palmach units were responsible for holding Jewish settlements (such as [[Gush Etzion]], [[Kfar Darom]] and [[Revivim]]) against Arab [[militia]]s. Although inferior in numbers and arms, Palmach soldiers held out long enough to allow the Haganah to mobilise the Jewish population and prepare for war.\n\n===The creation of the Israeli Army===\n[[File:Palmach Negev.jpg|thumb|right|A Palmach patrol in the Negev]]\nThe Palmach's last operation as an independent unit was against the Irgun, in the [[Altalena Affair]]. On 22 June 1948 the Irgun moored the Altalena, loaded with weapons, off Tel Aviv. Ben-Gurion ordered the Palmach to prevent the arms being landed. In an operation commanded by [[Yigal Allon]], with [[Yitzhak Rabin]] as his deputy, a cannon was used to sink the ship.

The Negev and Yiftah Brigades fought in the [[Negev]] against the [[Egyptian army]] and managed to stop and later repulse it into the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. The Yiftah Brigade was later transferred to the north. The Harel Brigade was centered on Jerusalem. The merging of the Palmach into the Israeli army involved a series of power struggles with Ben-Gurion, known as [[The Generals' Revolt]]. In 1949 many senior members of the Palmach resigned from the army.\n\nIn total, the Palmach lost 1,187 fighters during the war of independence and in the years prior to Israel's creation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmach.org.il/show_item.asp?itemId=8519&levelId=42855&itemType=0 |title=\u05e4\u05dc\u05de\"\u05d7 |publisher=Palmach.org.il |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Casualties ===\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 21221 The Palmach.JPG|thumb|Palmach [[M4 Sherman]] tank leading a convoy]]\nThe Palmach memorial site records 37 deaths of Palmach members between May 1941 and May 1945.

Twenty-one are recorded as killed in action and one killed in battle, fourteen being killed during the attempt to blow up the Achziv Bridge during the [[Night of the Bridges]]. Twenty-eight died in the struggle against the British.\n\nBetween the beginning of December 1947 and the end of May 1948, when the Israeli army was created, 574 deaths are listed, of whom 524 were killed in action or in battle; 77 while on convoy duty or securing roads; 59 during [[Operation Yevusi]], including 34 at [[Nabi Samwil|Nabi Samuel]]; 20 during [[Operation Nachshon]], all at al-Qastal; 68 during [[Operation Yiftach]]; 12 at [[Mishmar HaEmek]].

One of the dead is listed as also being a member of the [[Lechi]].\n\nThe Palmach memorial site records the death of 34 female members, seventeen killed in action or in battle.\n\nAround 520 of the fatalities had been born in Palestine; of whom 117 were from Tel Aviv, 97 from Jerusalem and 56 from Haifa. Over 550 had been born in Europe and Russia; with 181 from Poland, 99 from Germany and 95 from Romania. Another 131 of the dead originated from Arab and Muslim countries; 32 from Turkey, 23 from Syria and 21 from the Yemen. Of the remainder 13 had been born in the USA.\n\nOf the dead, 633 were aged between 18 and 22 years, 302 were between 22 and 25, 138 were 26 and over, and 91 were under 18 years of age.\n\n== Military organization ==\nThe Palmach was organised into regular companies (six in 1943), and five or six special units.\n\nPalmach special units included:\n[[File:German squad.jpg|thumb|right|The German squad]]\n[[File:Palmach Sapper.jpg|thumb|Palmach sapper preparing explosives under bridge in Wadi Serer, 1948.]]\n[[File:Negev Beasts.jpg|thumb|right|Negev Beasts]]\n* '''Ha-Machlaka Ha-Germanit''': the \"German Platoon\" (aka the Middle East Commando) performed covert operations and sabotage operations against [[Nazism|Nazi]] infrastructure in the [[Middle East]] and the [[Balkans]].\n* '''Ha-Machlaka Ha-Aravit''': the \"Arab Platoon\" performed covert operations and espionage missions against Arab militias, which frequently attacked Jewish settlements. It was the base for the Israeli Defense Forces's and the Israeli Border Police's [[Mista'arvim]] units.\n* '''[[Palyam]]''' (Sea Companies): the naval force of the Palmach was formed in 1943, attached to the Palmach's Staff Battalion (the 4th Battalion). They were in charge of underwater demolition and maritime activity units. The majority of their activities were related to the escorting of ships of [[Aliyah Bet]], immigration ships (66 of them in all) bringing Jewish refugees from [[Europe]] by boat, despite the British [[White Paper of 1939]], which introduced restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine.\n* '''[[Palavir]]''' (The Air Companies): made up of Jewish pilots, the Palmach air force was incorporated into the [[Sherut Avir]] (predecessor of the [[Israeli Air Force]]) upon the Sherut's foundation in late 1947. Eighteen [[Taylorcraft Auster]] Mk V aircraft and two Mk IIIs were purchased by Aviron from RAF scrapheap at Tel Nof 14 January 1947, with at least 13 aircraft restored to flying condition. First delivered late Feb 1948, these were used by the Palavir's, Tel Aviv, Galilee and Negev Squadrons for supply, reconnaissance and light attack roles.\n* '''Sabotage Units''': explosives experts who became the basis for the [[Israeli Engineering Corps]] in the IDF.\n\nThe Palmach put an emphasis on training field commanders (\u05de\u05e4\u05e7\u05d3\u05d9 \u05e9\u05d8\u05d7) and formed the basis for the Israeli army.\n\nDuring the 1948\u201349 [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|War of Independence]] the Palmach was expanded to form three infantry brigades commanded by Yigal Allon:\n\n* [[Yiftach Brigade|Yiftach]], with three battalions operating in Eastern Galilee (1st and 3rd and later 2nd)\n* [[Harel Brigade|Harel]], with three battalions operating (4th, 5th and 10th) in the Jerusalem area commanded by [[Yitzhak Rabin]] (then age 26)\n* [[Negev Brigade|Negev]], with four battalions (2nd, 7th, 8th and 9th), one of which was the jeep mounted \"Negev Beasts\"\n\nThe Command Battalion controlled naval, air and commando companies.\n\nThe [[battle cry]] of the Palmach commander was \"!\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\" (''Aharai''), which literally means \"after me!\" or \"follow me!\". It refers to the commander leading his troops instead of sending them out and staying behind.\n\n== In politics and culture ==\n[[File:Allon at Iraq Suwaydan.jpg|thumb|right|Yigal Allon, Commander of Southern Front, watches the bombardment of [[Iraq Suwaydan]], 9 November 1948]]\n[[File:Palmach ii.jpg|thumb|Members of 3rd Battalion gathered in [[Safed]] prior to the dissolution of the Palmach in 1949]]\nThe Palmach was a broad spectrum [[left-wing nationalism|left-wing nationalist]] organisation, associated with [[socialist]] parties. Its members trained and lived in [[kibbutz]]im. The political tendencies of its leaders such as [[Yigal Allon]] and [[Yitzhak Sadeh]] was towards [[Mapam]], a left-wing party in opposition to [[David Ben-Gurion]] and the [[Mapai]] ruling party. In 1944 a major split had occurred in [[Yishuv|Palestine's Jewish community's]] dominant party, Mapai, led by David Ben-Gurion. The breakaway group, which evolved into Mapam, were inspired by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] regime in the [[Soviet Union]], and had a strong following in the kibbutz movement. Since most of the Palmach's members came from the kibbutzim, the Mapam dominated the Palmach, with a majority of its officers being members.<ref>Peri, p. 47. Five Brigade Commanders and its Commanding Officer Yigal Allon were members.</ref> After 1948 Ben-Gurion, Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of the new state, had a series of confrontations with leaders of the Haganah and the Palmach. In a process that Ben-Gurion described as de-politicizing the army, the three Palmach brigades were disbanded and in 1950 most of the Mapam officers resigned. Those Palmach members who had been in Mapam and remained in the army had to endure several years on the margins. The effect of the de-politicizing was that all senior army posts were held by Mapai members or Ben-Gurion loyalists.<ref>Peri, p. 62. Those who stayed: Yitzhak Rabin, Haim BarLev, David Elazar.</ref> After demobilization many Palmach members founded new kibbutzim. In 1949 they set up [[Bar'am]], [[Beit Guvrin, Israel|Beit Guvrin]], [[Nir Yitzhak]] (named in honour of Yitzhak Sadeh), [[Palmachim]], [[Re'im]], [[Rosh HaNikra (kibbutz)|Rosh HaNikra]], [[Re'im]] and [[Yir'on]]. Palmach members were not, however, a unified, homogeneous collective with a single ideology. In the early years of the state of Israel they could be found in all political parties.\n\nYigal Allon, considered by many to be the representative of the Palmach generation, never reached a position of national leadership although he was Prime Minister for a few days between [[Levi Eshkol|Eshkol's]] death and [[Golda Meir|Meir's]] appointment in 1969. He died in 1980.\n\nBesides military contributions, the Palmach had great influence over the Israeli \"[[Sabra (person)|Tzabar]]\" culture. Palmach activities included \"Kumzitz\" (sitting around a fire at night, eating, talking and having fun), public singing and cross-country walking trips. These often took on mythical proportions and have become favorite activities for Israelis.\n\nThe Palmach also contributed many anecdotes, jokes, \"chizbat\" (short funny tales, often based on exaggerations), songs and even books and stories.\n\nNotable Palmach cultural figures include:\n* [[Yehuda Amichai]] \u2013 poet\n* [[Dahn Ben-Amotz]] \u2013 writer, journalist\n* [[Netiva Ben-Yehuda]] \u2013 journalist, writer, radio host\n* [[Haim Hefer]] \u2013 poet, writer\n* [[Haim Gouri]] \u2013 poet, writer\n* [[Shaike Ophir]] \u2013 actor\n* [[Moshe Shamir]] \u2013 writer, playwright\n* [[Hannah Szenes]] (Senesh) \u2013 poet\n* [[Vidal Sassoon]] \u2013 British hairdresser\n\n== Palmach song ==\nFull text of the song:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hebrewsongs.com/?song=shirhapalmach|title=Lyrics of the song|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|D0GqLBlgErU|Palmach song performed by an Israeli orchestra}}</ref>\n\n{|cellspacing=\"10\" rules=\"cols\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|First Stanza\n|-\n|\n\u05de\u05e1\u05d1\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e1\u05e2\u05e8,<br />\n\u05d0\u05da \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e9\u05d7<br />\n\u05dc\u05e4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5,<br />\n\u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d5, \u05d0\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d4\u05e4\u05dc\u05de\"\u05d7.<br />\n| \n''Though the storm is ever mounting''<br />\n''Still our heads remain unbowed.''<br />\n''We are ready to obey all commands,''<br />\n''The Palmach will win - we've vowed.''<br />\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Second Stanza\n|-\n|\n\u05de\u05de\u05d8\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e2\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e0\u05d2\u05d1,<br />\n\u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05e2\u05d3 \u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 <br />\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d1\u05d7\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 - \u05dc\u05e0\u05e9\u05e7<br />\n\u05db\u05dc \u05d1\u05d7\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05de\u05e8!<br />\n|\n''From Metulla to the Negev,''<br />\n''From the desert to the plain,''<br />\n''All our youth defend the homeland,''<br />\n''Till we bring it peace again.''<br />\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Third Stanza\n|-\n|\n\u05e0\u05ea\u05d9\u05d1 \u05dc\u05e0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d1\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd,<br />\n\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05dc \u05dc\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, -<br />\n\u05de\u05d5\u05dc \u05d0\u05d5\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d3\u05e8\u05db\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d9\u05e2\u05dc,<br />\n\u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05e6\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd.<br />\n|\n''In the eagle's path we follow,<br />\n''Over mountain tracks we go,''<br />\n''Among stony heights and caverns''<br />\n''We are seeking out the foe.''<br />\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Fourth Stanza\n|-\n|\n\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5,<br />\n\u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d5\u05d1\u05de\u05d7\u05e9\u05da<br />\n\u05dc\u05e4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5,<br />\n\u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d5, \u05d0\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d4\u05e4\u05dc\u05de\"\u05d7.<br />\n|\n''When you summon us to battle,''<br />\n''We will be there first by day or night,''<br />\n''We are ready when you give the command,''<br />\n''The Palmach will march in might.''<br />\n|}\n\n== Notable Palmachniks ==\n;High command:\n* [[Eliyahu Golomb]] \u2013 general commander of [[Haganah]]\n* [[Yitzhak Sadeh]] \u2013 first general commander of Palmach\n* [[Yigal Allon]] \u2013 second general commander of Palmach (1945\u20131948)\n* [[Giora Shanan]] \u2013 lieutenant general deputy commander of the Palmach\n* [[David Nameri]] \u2013 lieutenant general commander of the Palmach\n* [[Yohanan Ratner]] \u2013 strategy officer\n* [[Moshe Bar-Tikva]] \u2013 training officer\n* [[Yitzhak Rabin]] \u2013 brigade commander; Allon's second in command\n* [[Moshe Kelman]] \u2013 3rd Battalion commander\n;Special units commanders:\n* [[Shimon Avidan]] \u2013 commander of the \"German Department\"\n* [[Israel Ben-Yehuda]] \u2013 commander of the \"Arab Department\"\n* [[Yigal Allon]] \u2013 commander of the \"Syrian Department\"\n;[[Company (military unit)|Company]] commanders (as of 1943):\n* [[Yigal Allon]], [[Zalman Mars]] \u2013 Pluga Aleph commanders\n* [[Moshe Dayan]], [[Meir Davidson]], [[Uri Brenner]] \u2013 Pluga Beth commanders\n* [[Uri Yafeh]] \u2013 Pluga Gimel commander\n* [[Benjamin Goldstein Tzur]] \u2013 Pluga Dalet commander\n* [[Abraham Negev]] \u2013 Pluga Hey commander\n* [[Israel Livertovski]], [[Shimon Avidan]] \u2013 Pluga Vav commander\n* [[Yehuda.

Although on 31 October 2019 it was announced that NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy would fly the mission instead of Hoshide, in order to make sure an American astronaut was onboard the station at all times, in the face of delays with the [[Commercial Crew Program]]. These changes also meant that Soyuz MS-16's crew would make up part of Expedition 62.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-assigns-chris-cassidy-to-next-space-station-crew-holds-media-briefing|title=NASA Assigns Chris Cassidy to Next Space Station Crew, Holds Briefing|last=Potter|first=Sean|date=2019-10-30|website=NASA|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> The Expedition will also mark the first time the Russian segment of the ISS has had three crew members since [[Expedition 50]], and will be one of the shortest expeditions in the program, at just over two months long.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Portal |Spaceflight}}\n{{ISS expeditions}}\n\n[[Category:Expeditions to the International Space Station]]\n[[Category:2020 in spaceflight]]\n", "name_user": "Erick Soares3", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_62"}
