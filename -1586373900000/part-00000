Archive.org</ref><ref>http://www.prisonhistory.net/famous-prisons/devils-island/</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nThe prison system stretched over several locations, on the mainland and in the off-shore [[Salvation's Islands]]. [[\u00cele Royale]] was the reception centre for the general population of the [[penal colony]]; they were housed in moderate freedom due to the difficulty of escape from the island. [[Saint-Joseph Island]] was the ''Reclusion'', where inmates were sent to be punished by solitary confinement in silence and darkness for escapes or offences committed in the penal colony. [[Devil's Island (Kourou)|Devil's Island]] was for political prisoners. In the 19th century, the most famous such prisoner was Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]]. In addition to the prisons on each of the three islands in the Salut island group, the French constructed three related prison facilities on the South American mainland, just across the straits at [[Kourou#The Prisons|Kourou]]; {{convert|50|km|mi|sigfig=1}} east in [[Cayenne]], which later became the capital of French Guiana; and {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} west at [[Prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni|St.&nbsp;Laurent]].\n\n==Early penal system==\n[[Image:Lebreton engraving-09-hulk.jpg|thumb|A prison hulk in [[Toulon]] harbour.]]\nPrisoners convicted of felonies in the 17th and 18th centuries were sentenced to serve as oarsmen in the French [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] [[galley]] fleet. Given the harsh conditions, this was virtually a death sentence. Following the decommissioning of the Mediterranean galley fleet in 1666, the majority of prisoners were paired together in chains aboard galley [[Hulk (ship type)|hulks]] (''bagnes'') moored in French harbours until the barges rotted and sank. The prisoners were moved to live on the adjacent pontoons. Prisoners relied on charity or their families for food, bedding and clothing. They were required to work 12 hours a day in the docks, earning 10-15 centimes, which they could spend on food and wine. Other prisoners were housed in prisons onshore, where conditions were apparently so bad that many prisoners would beg to be transferred to the hulks.\n\nBy the early 19th century, the French urban population had increased from under six million to over 16 million,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} with a commensurate increase in crime. In 1832 legislation was passed mandating the state's provision of basic necessities to prisoners; however, prison reform changed the previous reliance on corporal punishment to imprisonment with a goal of vengeance and deterrence, with imprisonment considered a way to remove offenders from society. [[Recidivism]] of up to 75% had become a major problem; unemployed released prisoners began flooding the cities. In the 1840s, the state set up internal agricultural penal colonies as a place to receive prisoners, thereby removing them from urban environments and giving them employment. Prisoners were commonly sentenced under ''doublage'' by which, on completion of their sentence, they were required to work as employees at the penal colony for an additional period equal to their original sentence.<ref name = \"toth\">Toth, Stephen (2006) ''Beyond Papillon: The French Overseas Penal Colonies, 1854-(666),'' University of Nebraska Press {{ISBN|9780803244498}}</ref>\n\nThe French Navy, which had been tasked with managing the prison hulks, complained strongly about the cost of guarding the hulks and the disruption they caused to the shipyards. Following his coup in 1851, [[Napoleon III|Emperor Napoleon&nbsp;III]] ordered that the hulks be permanently closed and that [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] convicts be transferred overseas to colonies. Debate over where the convicts would be sent was prolonged. [[Algeria]] was ruled out by the Navy as it was controlled by the French Army; [[Haiti]], [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Texas]] were considered, but the government eventually chose [[French Guiana]].\n\nFrance had repeatedly failed since 1604 to colonize French Guiana. The last attempt at colonization was in 1763, and 75% of the 12,000 colonists that had been sent there died in their first year. By the 1850s, the declining number of survivors were on the brink of extinction. In 1852, Napoleon called for volunteer prisoners from the hulks to transfer to the new ''Bagne de Cayenne'' (Cayennes penal colony) at French Guiana; 3,000 convicts applied. Two categories of prisoners were eligible for transportation: ''transport\u00e9s,'' those civil-law prisoners sentenced under ''doublage,'' and ''d\u00e9port\u00e9s,'' prisoners convicted of political crimes, such as espionage or conspiracy. The hulks continued to be used, housing an average of 5,400 prisoners at a time, until they were finally closed around the end of the 19th century. The agricultural penal colonies continued to be used for juveniles until the last was closed in 1939.<ref name = \"toth\"/>\n\n==Use as penal colony==\nThe islands were part of a penal colony from 1852 onwards for criminals of France, who were convicted by juries rather than [[magistrate]]s. The main part of the penal colony was a labor camp that stretched along the border with Dutch Guiana (present-day [[Suriname]]). This penal colony was controversial as it had a reputation for harshness and brutality. Prisoner-on-prisoner violence was common; tropical diseases were rife. Only a small minority of broken survivors returned to France to tell how horrible it was; they sometimes scared other potential criminals to go straight.  This system was gradually phased out and has been completely shut down since 1953. Since the late 20th century, the islands have been tourist destinations. The islands were featured in the book ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'' (1969), published as a memoir by [[Henri Charri\u00e8re]], a former prisoner who escaped.\n\nDevil's Island and associated prisons eventually became one of the most infamous prison systems in history. While the prison system was in use (1852\u20131953),<ref name = \"prison closure date\"/> inmates included [[political prisoner]]s (such as 239&nbsp;republicans who opposed [[French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851|Napoleon III's coup d'\u00e9tat]] in 1851) and the most hardened of thieves and murderers. The vast majority of the more than 80,000&nbsp;prisoners sent to the Devil's Island prison system never made it back to France.  Many died due to disease and harsh conditions. Sanitary systems were limited, and the region was mosquito-infested, with [[endemic]] tropical diseases. The only exit from the island prisons was by water, and few convicts escaped.\n\nConvicts who were lucky enough to have family or friends willing to send them money had to have it sent to them in care of a prison guard. The standard practice was for the guard to keep for himself a quarter of the amount sent and give the rest to the prisoner.\n\nOn 30 May 1854, France passed a new law of forced residency.  It required convicts to stay in French Guiana after completion of sentence for a time equal to their forced labour time. If the original sentence exceeded eight years, they were forced to stay as residents for the remainder of their lives and were provided land to settle on. In time, a variety of penal regimes emerged, as convicts were divided into categories according to the severity of their crimes and the terms of their imprisonment or \"forced residence\" regime.<ref name=\"krakovitch\"/>\n\nAn 1885 law provided for repeat offenders for minor crimes to be sent to the French Guiana prison system, previously reserved for serious offenders and political prisoners. A limited number of convicted women were also sent to French Guiana, with the intent that they marry freed male inmates to aid in settlement and development of the colony. As the results were poor, the government discontinued the practice in 1907.<ref name=\"krakovitch\">{{cite journal  | last = Krakovitch  | first = Odile  | title = Les archives des bagnes de Cayenne et de Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie : la sous-s\u00e9rie colonies H aux archives nationales | journal = Revue d'histoire du XIXe si\u00e8cle | volume = 1985-01  |date = January 1985 | url = http://rh19.revues.org/document4.html | accessdate = 2007-11-15 }}</ref> On Devil's Island, the small prison facility did not usually house more than 12 persons.<ref name = \"prison closure date\"/>\n\n[[File:F.

The outbreak of [[World War&nbsp;II]] delayed this operation but, from 1946 until 1953, one by one the prisons were closed. The Devil's Island facility was the last to be closed.\n\nThe [[Aerial lift|cable car]] system that provided access to Devil's Island from Royale Island deteriorated and Devil's Island is now closed to public access.{{clarify|reason=what cable car? which island|date=August 2016}}  It can be viewed from off shore by use of charter boats.

They used two sacks filled with coconuts to act as lifebuoys. According to Charri\u00e8re, the two men leaped into heavy seas from a cliff and drifted to the mainland over a period of three days. Sylvain died in [[quicksand]] a short distance from the shore. From then, Charri\u00e8re was to meet the man of the name Cuic-Cuic who would help him escape again to the freedom he always wanted. But he was caught again and served in the Bagne at [[El Dorado, Venezuela|El Dorado]] where he would soon become free for life and lived in Venezuela.\n\nCharri\u00e8re's account aroused considerable controversy. French authorities disputed it and released penal colony records that contradicted his account. Charri\u00e8re had never been imprisoned on Devil's Island. He had escaped from a mainland prison. French journalists or prison authorities disputed other elements of his book and said that he had invented many incidents or appropriated experiences of other prisoners.<ref name=\"Mail & Guardian\">[http://www.mg.co.za/article/2005-06-26-papillon-alive-and-well-in-a-paris-retirement-home \"Papillon alive and well in a Paris retirement home\"],''Mail & Guardian'', 26 June 2005.</ref> Critics said he should have admitted his book was fiction.<ref name=\"Mail & Guardian\"/>\n\n===Felix Milani===\nFelix Milani travelled on the same ship over as Henri Charri\u00e8re and wrote a book about his experiences titled ''The Convict''.\n\n===Ren\u00e9 Belbeno\u00eet===\n[[Ren\u00e9 Belbeno\u00eet]] is perhaps the most renowned escapee of the penal colony, who wrote about his experiences in two well-received memoirs: ''Hell on Trial'' and '' The Dry Guillotine: Fifteen Years Among the Living Dead''.

In addition to the prisons on each of the three islands in the Salut island group, the French constructed three related prison facilities on the South American mainland, just across the straits at [[Kourou#The Prisons|Kourou]]; {{convert|50|km|mi|sigfig=1}} east in [[Cayenne]], which later became the capital of French Guiana; and {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} west at [[Prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni|St.&nbsp;Laurent]].\n\n==Early penal system==\n[[Image:Lebreton engraving-09-hulk.jpg|thumb|A prison hulk in [[Toulon]] harbour.]]\nPrisoners convicted of felonies in the 17th and 18th centuries were sentenced to serve as oarsmen in the French [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] [[galley]] fleet. Given the harsh conditions, this was virtually a death sentence. Following the decommissioning of the Mediterranean galley fleet in 1666, the majority of prisoners were paired together in chains aboard galley [[Hulk (ship type)|hulks]] (''bagnes'') moored in French harbours until the barges rotted and sank. The prisoners were moved to live on the adjacent pontoons. Prisoners relied on charity or their families for food, bedding and clothing. They were required to work 12 hours a day in the docks, earning 10-15 centimes, which they could spend on food and wine. Other prisoners were housed in prisons onshore, where conditions were apparently so bad that many prisoners would beg to be transferred to the hulks.\n\nBy the early 19th century, the French urban population had increased from under six million to over 16 million,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} with a commensurate increase in crime. In 1832 legislation was passed mandating the state's provision of basic necessities to prisoners; however, prison reform changed the previous reliance on corporal punishment to imprisonment with a goal of vengeance and deterrence, with imprisonment considered a way to remove offenders from society. [[Recidivism]] of up to 75% had become a major problem; unemployed released prisoners began flooding the cities. In the 1840s, the state set up internal agricultural penal colonies as a place to receive prisoners, thereby removing them from urban environments and giving them employment. Prisoners were commonly sentenced under ''doublage'' by which, on completion of their sentence, they were required to work as employees at the penal colony for an additional period equal to their original sentence.<ref name = \"toth\">Toth, Stephen (2006) ''Beyond Papillon: The French Overseas Penal Colonies, 1854-(666),'' University of Nebraska Press {{ISBN|9780803244498}}</ref>\n\nThe French Navy, which had been tasked with managing the prison hulks, complained strongly about the cost of guarding the hulks and the disruption they caused to the shipyards. Following his coup in 1851, [[Napoleon III|Emperor Napoleon&nbsp;III]] ordered that the hulks be permanently closed and that [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] convicts be transferred overseas to colonies. Debate over where the convicts would be sent was prolonged. [[Algeria]] was ruled out by the Navy as it was controlled by the French Army; [[Haiti]], [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Texas]] were considered, but the government eventually chose [[French Guiana]].\n\nFrance had repeatedly failed since 1604 to colonize French Guiana. The last attempt at colonization was in 1763, and 75% of the 12,000 colonists that had been sent there died in their first year. By the 1850s, the declining number of survivors were on the brink of extinction. In 1852, Napoleon called for volunteer prisoners from the hulks to transfer to the new ''Bagne de Cayenne'' (Cayennes penal colony) at French Guiana; 3,000 convicts applied. Two categories of prisoners were eligible for transportation: ''transport\u00e9s,'' those civil-law prisoners sentenced under ''doublage,'' and ''d\u00e9port\u00e9s,'' prisoners convicted of political crimes, such as espionage or conspiracy. The hulks continued to be used, housing an average of 5,400 prisoners at a time, until they were finally closed around the end of the 19th century. The agricultural penal colonies continued to be used for juveniles until the last was closed in 1939.<ref name = \"toth\"/>\n\n==Use as penal colony==\nThe islands were part of a penal colony from 1852 onwards for criminals of France, who were convicted by juries rather than [[magistrate]]s. The main part of the penal colony was a labor camp that stretched along the border with Dutch Guiana (present-day [[Suriname]]). This penal colony was controversial as it had a reputation for harshness and brutality. Prisoner-on-prisoner violence was common; tropical diseases were rife. Only a small minority of broken survivors returned to France to tell how horrible it was; they sometimes scared other potential criminals to go straight.  This system was gradually phased out and has been completely shut down since 1953. Since the late 20th century, the islands have been tourist destinations. The islands were featured in the book ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'' (1969), published as a memoir by [[Henri Charri\u00e8re]], a former prisoner who escaped.\n\nDevil's Island and associated prisons eventually became one of the most infamous prison systems in history. While the prison system was in use (1852\u20131953),<ref name = \"prison closure date\"/> inmates included [[political prisoner]]s (such as 239&nbsp;republicans who opposed [[French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851|Napoleon III's coup d'\u00e9tat]] in 1851) and the most hardened of thieves and murderers. The vast majority of the more than 80,000&nbsp;prisoners sent to the Devil's Island prison system never made it back to France.  Many died due to disease and harsh conditions. Sanitary systems were limited, and the region was mosquito-infested, with [[endemic]] tropical diseases. The only exit from the island prisons was by water, and few convicts escaped.\n\nConvicts who were lucky enough to have family or friends willing to send them money had to have it sent to them in care of a prison guard. The standard practice was for the guard to keep for himself a quarter of the amount sent and give the rest to the prisoner.\n\nOn 30 May 1854, France passed a new law of forced residency.  It required convicts to stay in French Guiana after completion of sentence for a time equal to their forced labour time. If the original sentence exceeded eight years, they were forced to stay as residents for the remainder of their lives and were provided land to settle on. In time, a variety of penal regimes emerged, as convicts were divided into categories according to the severity of their crimes and the terms of their imprisonment or \"forced residence\" regime.<ref name=\"krakovitch\"/>\n\nAn 1885 law provided for repeat offenders for minor crimes to be sent to the French Guiana prison system, previously reserved for serious offenders and political prisoners. A limited number of convicted women were also sent to French Guiana, with the intent that they marry freed male inmates to aid in settlement and development of the colony. As the results were poor, the government discontinued the practice in 1907.<ref name=\"krakovitch\">{{cite journal  | last = Krakovitch  | first = Odile  | title = Les archives des bagnes de Cayenne et de Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie : la sous-s\u00e9rie colonies H aux archives nationales | journal = Revue d'histoire du XIXe si\u00e8cle | volume = 1985-01  |date = January 1985 | url = http://rh19.revues.org/document4.html | accessdate = 2007-11-15 }}</ref> On Devil's Island, the small prison facility did not usually house more than 12 persons.<ref name = \"prison closure date\"/>\n\n[[File:F.

Sylvain died in [[quicksand]] a short distance from the shore. From then, Charri\u00e8re was to meet the man of the name Cuic-Cuic who would help him escape again to the freedom he always wanted. But he was caught again and served in the Bagne at [[El Dorado, Venezuela|El Dorado]] where he would soon become free for life and lived in Venezuela.\n\nCharri\u00e8re's account aroused considerable controversy. French authorities disputed it and released penal colony records that contradicted his account. Charri\u00e8re had never been imprisoned on Devil's Island. He had escaped from a mainland prison.

From the 17th to the 19th century, the main political entities in the area were the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], along with the city-state of [[Porto-Novo]], and a large area with many different nations to the north. This region was referred to as the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]] from as early as the 17th century due to the large number of enslaved people who were shipped to the New World during the [[Trans-Atlantic slave trade]]. After enslavement was abolished, France took over the country and renamed it [[French Dahomey]]. In 1960, Dahomey gained full independence from France. The [[sovereign state]] has had a tumultuous history since then, with many different democratic governments, military coups, and military governments. A [[Marxist\u2013Leninist state]] called the [[People's Republic of Benin]] existed between 1975 and 1990.

They reiterated this goal in the ''Malabo Declaration'' adopted in Equatorial Guinea in 2014. In the latter declaration, they reaffirmed their 'intention to devote 10% of their national budgets to agricultural development and agreed to targets such as doubling agricultural productivity, halving post-harvest loss and bringing stunting down to 10% across Africa'. However, African leaders meeting in Equatorial Guinea failed to resolve the debate on establishing a common standard of measurement for the 10% target.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.one.org/africa/press/one-applauds-au-malabo-declarations-re-commitment-to-agriculture-transformation/|title=One Applauds AU Malabo Declaration's Recommitment to Agriculture Transformation|date=2 July 2014|work=ONE.org|access-date=12 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010183945/https://www.one.org/africa/press/one-applauds-au-malabo-declarations-re-commitment-to-agriculture-transformation/|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Research output ===\nBenin has the third-highest publication intensity for scientific journals in West Africa, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, Science Citation Index Expanded. There were 25.5 scientific articles per million inhabitants cataloged in this database in 2014. This compares with 65.0 for the Gambia, 49.6 for Cape Verde, 23.2 for Senegal and 21.9 for Ghana. The volume of publications in this database tripled in Benin between 2005 and 2014 from 86 to 270. Between 2008 and 2014, Benin's main scientific collaborators were based in France (529 articles), United States (261), United Kingdom (254), Belgium (198) and Germany (156).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Transportation==\n{{main|Transport in Benin}}\n[[Transport in Benin]] includes road, rail, water and air transportation. Benin possesses a total of 6,787&nbsp;km of [[highway]], of which 1,357&nbsp;km are paved. Of the paved highways in the country, there are 10 [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]]. This leaves 5,430&nbsp;km of unpaved road. The [[Trans\u2013West African Coastal Highway|Trans-West African Coastal Highway]] crosses Benin, connecting it to [[Nigeria]] to the east, and [[Togo]], [[Ghana]] and [[Ivory Coast]] to the west. When construction in [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]] is finished, the highway will continue west to seven other [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) nations. A paved highway also connects Benin northwards to [[Niger]], and through that country to [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]] to the north-west.\n\n[[Rail transport in Benin]] consists of {{convert|578|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of [[Single track (rail)|single track]], {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}} railway. Benin does not, at this time, share railway links with adjacent countries, but construction work has commenced on international lines connecting Benin with Niger and Nigeria, with outline plans announced for further connections to Togo and Burkina Faso. Benin will be a participant in the [[AfricaRail]] project.\n\n[[Cadjehoun Airport]], located at Cotonou, has direct international jet service to [[Accra]], Niamey, [[Monrovia]], [[Lagos]], [[Ouagadougou]], [[Lom\u00e9]], and [[Douala]], as well as other cities in Africa. Direct services also link Cotonou to Paris, Brussels, and Istanbul.\n\n== Health ==\n{{main|Health in Benin}}\n{{see also|HIV/AIDS in Benin}}\nThe [[HIV/AIDS]] rate in Benin was estimated in 2013 at 1.13% of adults aged 15\u201349 years.<ref name=CIA3>{{cite web|title=HIV/AIDS\u2014Adult Prevalence Rate|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html|accessdate=16 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221190412/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html|archive-date=21 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Malaria]] is a problem in Benin, being a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children younger than five years.<ref name=Malaria>{{cite web|title=Malaria in Benin|website=malaria.com|date=24 February 2011|url=http://www.malaria.com/featured/malaria-beni|accessdate=16 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122100605/http://www.malaria.com/featured/malaria-beni|archive-date=22 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980s, less than 30% of the country's population had access to primary health care services. Benin had one of the highest death rates for children under the age of five in the world. Its [[infant mortality rate]] stood at 203 deaths for every {{gaps|1|000}} live births. Only one in three mothers had access to child health care services. The [[Bamako Initiative]] changed that dramatically by introducing community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/inf-new/child6.htm|title=Bamako Initiative revitalizes primary health care in Benin|publisher=WHO.int|accessdate=28 December 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106133809/http://www.who.int/inf-new/child6.htm|archive-date=6 January 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> {{As of|2015}}, Benin had the 26th highest rate of [[maternal mortality]] in the world.<ref name=CIA2>{{cite web|title=Maternal Mortality Rate|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html|accessdate=16 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418113820/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html|archive-date=18 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> According to a 2013 UNICEF report, 13% of women had undergone [[female genital mutilation]].<ref name=UNICEF2013p27>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A statistical overview and exploration of the dynamics of change] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405083031/http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf |date=5 April 2015 }}.

Composer [[Wally Badarou]] and singer [[Gnonnas Pedro]] are also of Beninese descent.\n\nBiennale Benin, continuing the projects of several organizations and artists, started in the country in 2010 as a collaborative event called \"Regard Benin\". In 2012, the project became a Biennial coordinated by the Consortium, a federation of local associations. The international exhibition and artistic program of the 2012 Biennale Benin are curated by Abdellah Karroum and the Curatorial Delegation.\n\nA number of Beninese artists have received major international recognition, such as [[Georges Ad\u00e9agbo]], [[Meschac Gaba]], [[Romuald Hazoum\u00e8]], [[Dominique Zinkp\u00e8]] and [[Emo de Medeiros]].\n\n===Customary names===\nMany Beninese in the south of the country have [[Akan name|Akan-based names]] indicating the day of the week on which they were born. This is due to influence of the [[Akan people]] like the [[Akwamu]] and others.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/concise/Akwamu Akwamu \u2013 Encyclopedia Article and More from] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122016/http://www.merriam-webster.com/concise/akwamu |date=12 January 2012 }}. Merriam-Webster (13 August 2010), retrieved 15 August 2012</ref>\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Languages of Benin}}\nLocal languages are used as the languages of instruction in elementary schools, with French only introduced after several years. In wealthier cities, however, French is usually taught at an earlier age. At the secondary School level, local language is generally forbidden and French is the sole language of instruction. Beninese languages are generally transcribed with a separate letter for each speech sound ([[phoneme]]), rather than using [[diacritic]]s as in French or [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] as in English. This includes Beninese [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], which in [[Nigeria]] is written with both diacritics and digraphs. For instance, the [[mid vowel]]s are written ''\u00e9 \u00e8, \u00f4, o'' in French are written ''{{IPA|e, \u025b, o, \u0254}}'' in Beninese languages, whereas the [[consonant]]s are written ''ng'' and ''sh'' or ''ch'' in English are written ''\u014b'' and ''c.'' However, digraphs are used for [[nasal vowel]]s and the [[labial-velar consonant]]s ''kp'' and ''gb,'' as in the name of the [[Fon language]] ''Fon gbe'' {{IPA|/f\u00f5 \u0261\u0361be/}}, and diacritics are used as [[tone (linguistics)|tone marks]]. In French-language publications, a mixture of French and Beninese orthographies may be seen.\n\n===Cuisine===\n[[File:Bahia acaraje.jpg|thumb|[[Acaraj\u00e9]] is peeled [[black-eyed pea]]s formed into a ball and then deep-fried.]]\n{{main|Benin cuisine}}\nBeninese cuisine is known in Africa for its exotic ingredients and flavorful dishes. Beninese cuisine involves fresh meals served with a variety of key sauces. In southern Benin cuisine, the most common ingredient is [[Maize|corn]], often used to prepare [[dough]] which is mainly served with [[peanut]]- or [[tomato]]-based [[sauce]]s. [[Fish]] and [[chicken]] are the most common meats used in southern Beninese cuisine, but [[beef]], [[goat]], and [[Aethomys|bush rat]] are also consumed. The main staple in northern Benin is [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], often served with sauces mentioned above. The population in the northern provinces use beef and [[pork]] meat which is fried in palm or peanut oil or cooked in sauces. [[Cheese]] is used in some dishes. [[Couscous]], rice, and [[bean]]s are commonly eaten, along with fruits such as [[mango]]es, oranges, avocados, bananas, kiwi fruit, and pineapples.\n\nMeat is usually quite expensive, and meals are generally light on meat and generous on [[vegetable fat]]. Frying in palm or peanut oil is the most common meat preparation, and [[smoked fish]] is commonly prepared in Benin. Grinders are used to prepare [[Cornmeal|corn flour]], which is made into a dough and served with sauces. \"Chicken on the spit\" is a traditional recipe in which chicken is roasted over a fire on wooden sticks. [[Arecaceae|Palm]] roots are sometimes soaked in a jar with salt water and sliced garlic to tenderize them, then used in dishes. Many people have outdoor mud stoves for cooking.\n\n===Sports===\n[[Association football|Football]] is generally considered the most popular sport in Benin. In the past decade, [[baseball]] has been introduced to the country.<ref>Mozey, Brian.

The [[National Directorate of Scientific and Technological Research]] handles planning and coordination, whereas the [[National Council for Scientific and Technical Research and National Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters]] each play an advisory role. Financial support comes from Benin's [[National Fund for Scientific Research and Technological Innovation]]. [[The Benin Agency for the Promotion of Research Results and Technological Innovation]] carries out technology transfer through the development and dissemination of research results.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe regulatory framework has evolved since 2006 till date when the country's first science policy was prepared. This has since been updated and complemented by new texts on science and innovation (the year of adoption is between brackets):<ref name=\":0\" />\n* a manual for monitoring and evaluating research structures and organizations (2013);\n* a manual on how to select research programmes and projects and apply to the National Fund for Scientific Research and Technological Innovation (2013) for competitive grants;\n* a draft act for funding scientific research and innovation and a draft code of ethics for scientific research and innovation were both submitted to the Supreme Court in 2014;\n* a strategic plan for scientific research and innovation (under development in 2015).\nEqually important are Benin's efforts to integrate science into existing policy documents:\n* ''Benin Development Strategies 2025'': ''Benin 2025 Alafia'' (2000);\n* Growt''h Strategy for Poverty Reduction 2011\u20132016'' (2011);\n* Phase 3 of the ''Ten-year Development Plan for the Education Sector'', covering 2013\u20132015;\n* ''Development Plan for Higher Education and Scientific Research 2013\u20132017'' (2014).\nIn 2015, Benin's priority areas for scientific research were: health, education, construction and building materials, transportation and trade, culture, tourism and handicrafts, cotton/textiles, food, energy and climate change.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe main challenges facing research and development in Benin are:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* the unfavorable organizational framework for research: weak governance, a lack of co-operation between research structures and the absence of an official document on the status of researchers;\n* the inadequate use of human resources and the lack of any motivational policy for researchers; and \n* the mismatch between research and development needs.\n\n=== Human and financial investment in research ===\nIn 2007, Benin counted 1,000 researchers (in headcounts). This corresponds to 115 researchers per million inhabitants. The main research structures in Benin are the Centre for Scientific and Technical Research, National Institute of Agricultural Research, National Institute for Training and Research in Education, Office of Geological and Mining Research and the Centre for Entomological Research.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe University of Abomey-Calavi was selected by the [[World Bank]] in 2014 to participate in its Centres of Excellence project, owing to its expertise in applied mathematics. Within this project, the World Bank has loaned $8 million to Benin. The Association of African Universities has also received funds to enable it to co-ordinate knowledge-sharing among the 19 universities in West Africa involved in the project.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere are no available data on Benin's level of investment in research and development.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2013, the government devoted 2.5% of GDP to public health. In December 2014, 150 volunteer health professionals travelled to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from Benin, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria, as part of a joint initiative by the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) a<nowiki/>nd its specialized agency, the West African Health Organisation, to help combat the epidemic. The Ebola epidemic has been a tragic reminder of the chronic underinvestment in West African health systems.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Government of Benin devoted less than 5% of GDP to agricultural development in 2010, even though the members of the [[African Union]] had agreed to commit at least 10% of GDP to this area in the ''Maputo Declaration'' of 2003. They reiterated this goal in the ''Malabo Declaration'' adopted in Equatorial Guinea in 2014. In the latter declaration, they reaffirmed their 'intention to devote 10% of their national budgets to agricultural development and agreed to targets such as doubling agricultural productivity, halving post-harvest loss and bringing stunting down to 10% across Africa'. However, African leaders meeting in Equatorial Guinea failed to resolve the debate on establishing a common standard of measurement for the 10% target.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.one.org/africa/press/one-applauds-au-malabo-declarations-re-commitment-to-agriculture-transformation/|title=One Applauds AU Malabo Declaration's Recommitment to Agriculture Transformation|date=2 July 2014|work=ONE.org|access-date=12 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010183945/https://www.one.org/africa/press/one-applauds-au-malabo-declarations-re-commitment-to-agriculture-transformation/|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Research output ===\nBenin has the third-highest publication intensity for scientific journals in West Africa, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, Science Citation Index Expanded.

The volume of publications in this database tripled in Benin between 2005 and 2014 from 86 to 270. Between 2008 and 2014, Benin's main scientific collaborators were based in France (529 articles), United States (261), United Kingdom (254), Belgium (198) and Germany (156).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Transportation==\n{{main|Transport in Benin}}\n[[Transport in Benin]] includes road, rail, water and air transportation. Benin possesses a total of 6,787&nbsp;km of [[highway]], of which 1,357&nbsp;km are paved. Of the paved highways in the country, there are 10 [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]]. This leaves 5,430&nbsp;km of unpaved road. The [[Trans\u2013West African Coastal Highway|Trans-West African Coastal Highway]] crosses Benin, connecting it to [[Nigeria]] to the east, and [[Togo]], [[Ghana]] and [[Ivory Coast]] to the west. When construction in [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]] is finished, the highway will continue west to seven other [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) nations. A paved highway also connects Benin northwards to [[Niger]], and through that country to [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]] to the north-west.\n\n[[Rail transport in Benin]] consists of {{convert|578|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of [[Single track (rail)|single track]], {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}} railway. Benin does not, at this time, share railway links with adjacent countries, but construction work has commenced on international lines connecting Benin with Niger and Nigeria, with outline plans announced for further connections to Togo and Burkina Faso. Benin will be a participant in the [[AfricaRail]] project.\n\n[[Cadjehoun Airport]], located at Cotonou, has direct international jet service to [[Accra]], Niamey, [[Monrovia]], [[Lagos]], [[Ouagadougou]], [[Lom\u00e9]], and [[Douala]], as well as other cities in Africa.

In wealthier cities, however, French is usually taught at an earlier age. At the secondary School level, local language is generally forbidden and French is the sole language of instruction. Beninese languages are generally transcribed with a separate letter for each speech sound ([[phoneme]]), rather than using [[diacritic]]s as in French or [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] as in English. This includes Beninese [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], which in [[Nigeria]] is written with both diacritics and digraphs. For instance, the [[mid vowel]]s are written ''\u00e9 \u00e8, \u00f4, o'' in French are written ''{{IPA|e, \u025b, o, \u0254}}'' in Beninese languages, whereas the [[consonant]]s are written ''ng'' and ''sh'' or ''ch'' in English are written ''\u014b'' and ''c.'' However, digraphs are used for [[nasal vowel]]s and the [[labial-velar consonant]]s ''kp'' and ''gb,'' as in the name of the [[Fon language]] ''Fon gbe'' {{IPA|/f\u00f5 \u0261\u0361be/}}, and diacritics are used as [[tone (linguistics)|tone marks]]. In French-language publications, a mixture of French and Beninese orthographies may be seen.\n\n===Cuisine===\n[[File:Bahia acaraje.jpg|thumb|[[Acaraj\u00e9]] is peeled [[black-eyed pea]]s formed into a ball and then deep-fried.]]\n{{main|Benin cuisine}}\nBeninese cuisine is known in Africa for its exotic ingredients and flavorful dishes. Beninese cuisine involves fresh meals served with a variety of key sauces. In southern Benin cuisine, the most common ingredient is [[Maize|corn]], often used to prepare [[dough]] which is mainly served with [[peanut]]- or [[tomato]]-based [[sauce]]s. [[Fish]] and [[chicken]] are the most common meats used in southern Beninese cuisine, but [[beef]], [[goat]], and [[Aethomys|bush rat]] are also consumed. The main staple in northern Benin is [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], often served with sauces mentioned above. The population in the northern provinces use beef and [[pork]] meat which is fried in palm or peanut oil or cooked in sauces. [[Cheese]] is used in some dishes. [[Couscous]], rice, and [[bean]]s are commonly eaten, along with fruits such as [[mango]]es, oranges, avocados, bananas, kiwi fruit, and pineapples.\n\nMeat is usually quite expensive, and meals are generally light on meat and generous on [[vegetable fat]]. Frying in palm or peanut oil is the most common meat preparation, and [[smoked fish]] is commonly prepared in Benin. Grinders are used to prepare [[Cornmeal|corn flour]], which is made into a dough and served with sauces. \"Chicken on the spit\" is a traditional recipe in which chicken is roasted over a fire on wooden sticks. [[Arecaceae|Palm]] roots are sometimes soaked in a jar with salt water and sliced garlic to tenderize them, then used in dishes. Many people have outdoor mud stoves for cooking.\n\n===Sports===\n[[Association football|Football]] is generally considered the most popular sport in Benin. In the past decade, [[baseball]] has been introduced to the country.<ref>Mozey, Brian.

Lee|Robert E. Lee's]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]] and Union General [[George B. McClellan|George B. McClellan's]] [[Army of the Potomac]], near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland]] and [[Antietam Creek]]. Part of the [[Maryland Campaign]], it was the first [[field army]]\u2013level engagement in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War]] to take place on Union soil. It was the bloodiest day in United States military history, with a combined tally of 22,717 dead, wounded, or missing.{{sfn|McPherson|2002|p=3}}\n\nAfter pursuing the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] general [[Robert E. Lee]] into [[Maryland]], [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George B. McClellan]] of the [[Union Army]] launched attacks against Lee's army, in defensive positions behind Antietam Creek. At dawn on September 17, Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]]'s corps mounted a powerful assault on Lee's left flank.  Attacks and counterattacks swept across Miller's Cornfield, and fighting swirled around the [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Dunker Church]]. Union assaults against the Sunken Road eventually pierced the Confederate center, but the Federal advantage was not followed up. In the afternoon, Union Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]'s corps entered the action, capturing a stone bridge over Antietam Creek and advancing against the Confederate right. At a crucial moment, Confederate Maj. Gen. [[A. P. Hill]]'s division arrived from [[Harpers Ferry]] and launched a surprise counterattack, driving back Burnside and ending the battle. Although outnumbered two-to-one, Lee committed his entire force, while McClellan sent in less than three-quarters of his army, enabling Lee to fight the Federals to a standstill. During the night, both armies consolidated their lines. In spite of crippling casualties, Lee continued to skirmish with McClellan throughout September 18, while removing his battered army south of the [[Potomac River]].<ref>[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/md003.htm NPS].</ref>\n\nDespite having superiority of numbers, McClellan's attacks failed to achieve [[force concentration]]. This allowed Lee to counter by shifting forces and moving along [[interior lines]] to meet each challenge. This is why  McClellan failed to destroy Lee's army even though he had ample reserve forces that he could have deployed to exploit localized successes. McClellan persisted in his erroneous belief that he was outnumbered. This contributed to his cautiousness throughout the campaign.\n\nMcClellan had halted Lee's invasion of Maryland, but Lee was able to withdraw his army back to [[Virginia]] without interference from the cautious McClellan. McClellan's refusal to pursue Lee's army led to his removal from command by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] in November. Although the battle was [[Tactical victory|tactically]] inconclusive, the Confederate troops had withdrawn first from the battlefield, and abandoned their invasion, making it a Union strategic victory. It was a sufficiently significant victory to give Lincoln the confidence to announce his [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which, by freeing more than 3.5 million [[slaves]] in the Confederate states, began the process of [[emancipation]] of all remaining persons considered, legally, as slaves within the [[United States]], and in doing so, discouraged the British and French governments, which were heavily opposed to slavery, and had in fact abolished slavery in their respective nations prior to the [[American Civil War]], from pursuing any potential plans to recognize the Confederacy.\n\n==Background: Maryland Campaign==\n{{Main|Maryland Campaign}}\n{{further|Peninsula Campaign|Seven Days Battles|Northern Virginia Campaign|Second Battle of Bull Run|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|American Civil War}}\n\n[[File:Maryland Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Maryland Campaign, actions '''September 3 to 15''', 1862\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n\nRobert E.

Emboldened by success, the Confederate leadership intended to take the war into enemy territory. Lee's invasion of Maryland was intended to run simultaneously with an invasion of Kentucky by the armies of [[Braxton Bragg]] and [[Edmund Kirby Smith]]. It was also necessary for logistical reasons, as northern Virginia's farms had been stripped bare of food. Based on events such as the [[Baltimore riot of 1861|Baltimore riots]] in the spring of 1861 and the fact that President Lincoln had to pass through the city in disguise en route to his inauguration, Confederate leaders assumed that Maryland would welcome the Confederate forces warmly. They sang the tune \"[[Maryland, My Maryland]]!\" as they marched, but by the fall of 1862 pro-Union sentiment was winning out, especially in the western parts of the state. Civilians generally hid inside their houses as Lee's army passed through their towns, or watched in cold silence, while the [[Army of the Potomac]] was cheered and encouraged. Some Confederate politicians, including [[President of the Confederate States of America|President]] [[Jefferson Davis]], believed that the prospect of foreign recognition would increase if the Confederacy won a military victory on Union soil; such a victory might gain recognition and financial support from the United Kingdom and France, although there is no evidence that Lee thought the Confederacy should base its military plans on this possibility.{{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=65\u201366}}{{sfn|McPherson|2002|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nWhile McClellan's 87,000-man<ref name=USA-strength/> [[Army of the Potomac]] was moving to intercept Lee, two Union soldiers (Corporal Barton W. Mitchell and First Sergeant [[John M. Bloss]]{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=112}}{{sfn|McPherson|2002|p=108}} of the 27th Indiana Volunteer Infantry) discovered a mislaid copy of Lee's detailed battle plans&mdash;[[Special Order 191]]&mdash;wrapped around three cigars. The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically (to [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]], and [[Hagerstown, Maryland]]), thus making each subject to isolation and defeat if McClellan could move quickly enough. McClellan waited about 18 hours before deciding to take advantage of this intelligence and reposition his forces, thus squandering an opportunity to defeat Lee decisively.{{sfn|McPherson|2002|p=109}}\n\nThere were two significant engagements in the Maryland campaign prior to the major battle of Antietam: Maj. Gen. [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson's]] capture of [[Battle of Harpers Ferry|Harpers Ferry]] and McClellan's assault through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] in the [[Battle of South Mountain]]. The former was significant because a large portion of Lee's army was absent from the start of the battle of Antietam, attending to the surrender of the Union garrison; the latter because stout Confederate defenses at two passes through the mountains delayed McClellan's advance enough for Lee to concentrate the remainder of his army at Sharpsburg.{{sfn|McPherson|2002|pp=110\u201312}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n{{further|Antietam Union order of battle}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Opposing army commanders\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=\"2\" widths=90>\nFile:George B McClellan - retouched.jpg|<center>Maj.

Although most histories, including the [[Official Records of the American Civil War|Official Records]], refer to these organizations as Corps, that designation was not formally made until November 6, 1862, after the Maryland Campaign. Longstreet's unit was referred to as the Right Wing, Jackson's the Left Wing, for most of 1862. (Gen. Lee referred in official correspondence to these as \"commands\". See, for instance, Luvaas and Nelson, p. 4. Lee used this term because a Confederate law forbade the creation of army corps. It had been intended as a states' rights measure to ensure that governors would retain some control over the troops from their state, and Lee lobbied strongly for repeal of this law.) Harsh, ''Sounding the Shallows'', pp. 32&ndash;90, states that D.H. Hill was temporarily in command of a \"Center Wing\" with his own division commanded initially by Brig. Gen. [[Roswell S.

[[William N. Pendleton]]. The Second Corps was organized with artillery attached to each division, in contrast to the First Corps, which reserved its artillery at the corps level.\n\n==Prelude to battle==\n\n===Disposition of armies===\n[[File:US ARMY MARYLAND CAMPAIGN MAP 4 (ANTIETAM).jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Battlefield of Antietam, situation '''September 15 to 16''', 1862]]\n[[File:Antietam Overview.png|thumb|upright=1.8|right|'''Overview''' of the Battle of Antietam]]\n\nNear the town of Sharpsburg, Lee deployed his available forces behind Antietam Creek along a low ridge, starting on September 15. While it was an effective defensive position, it was not an impregnable one. The terrain provided excellent cover for infantrymen, with rail and stone fences, outcroppings of [[limestone]], little hollows and [[wikt:swale|swales]]. The creek to their front was only a minor barrier, ranging from 60 to 100 feet (18&ndash;30 m) in width, and was fordable in places and crossed by three stone bridges each a mile (1.5&nbsp;km) apart. It was also a precarious position because the Confederate rear was blocked by the [[Potomac River]] and only a single crossing point, Boteler's Ford at [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia|Shepherdstown]], was nearby should retreat be necessary. (The ford at [[Williamsport, Maryland]], was {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} northwest from Sharpsburg and had been used by Jackson in his march to Harpers Ferry. The disposition of Union forces during the battle made it impractical to consider retreating in that direction.) And on September 15, the force under Lee's immediate command consisted of no more than 18,000 men, only a third the size of the Federal army.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=60}}\n\nThe first two Union divisions arrived on the afternoon of September 15 and the bulk of the remainder of the army late that evening. Although an immediate Union attack on the morning of September 16 would have had an overwhelming advantage in numbers, McClellan's trademark caution and his belief that Lee had as many as 100,000 men at Sharpsburg caused him to delay his attack for a day.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=174}} This gave the Confederates more time to prepare defensive positions and allowed Longstreet's corps to arrive from Hagerstown and Jackson's corps, minus A.P. Hill's division, to arrive from Harpers Ferry. Jackson defended the left (northern) flank, anchored on the Potomac, Longstreet the right (southern) flank, anchored on the Antietam, a line that was about 4 miles (6&nbsp;km) long. (As the battle progressed and Lee shifted units, these corps boundaries overlapped considerably.){{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=164, 175\u201376}}\n\nOn the evening of September 16, McClellan ordered Hooker's I Corps to cross Antietam Creek and probe the enemy positions. Meade's division cautiously attacked Hood's troops near the East Woods. After darkness fell, artillery fire continued as McClellan positioned his troops for the next day's fighting. McClellan's plan was to overwhelm the enemy's left flank. He arrived at this decision because of the configuration of bridges over the Antietam. The lower bridge (which would soon be named Burnside Bridge) was dominated by Confederate positions on the bluffs overlooking it. The middle bridge, on the road from [[Boonsboro, Maryland|Boonsboro]], was subject to artillery fire from the heights near Sharpsburg. But the upper bridge was 2 miles (3&nbsp;km) east of the Confederate guns and could be crossed safely. McClellan planned to commit more than half his army to the assault, starting with two corps, supported by a third, and if necessary a fourth. He intended to launch a simultaneous diversionary attack against the Confederate right with a fifth corps, and he was prepared to strike the center with his reserves if either attack succeeded.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=63}} The skirmish in the East Woods served to signal McClellan's intentions to Lee, who prepared his defenses accordingly. He shifted men to his left flank and sent urgent messages to his two commanders who had not yet arrived on the battlefield: Lafayette McLaws with two divisions and A.P. Hill with one division.<ref>Harsh, ''Taken at the Flood'', pp. 366&ndash;67</ref>{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=174}}\n\n===Terrain and its consequences===\nMcClellan's plans were ill-coordinated and were executed poorly. He issued to each of his subordinate commanders only the orders for his own corps, not general orders describing the entire battle plan. The terrain of the battlefield made it difficult for those commanders to monitor events outside of their sectors. Moreover, McClellan's headquarters were more than a mile in the rear (at the Philip Pry house, east of the creek). This made it difficult for him to control the separate corps. This is why the battle progressed the next day as essentially three separate, mostly uncoordinated battles: morning in the northern end of the battlefield, midday in the center, and afternoon in the south. This lack of coordination and concentration of McClellan's forces almost completely nullified the two-to-one advantage the Union enjoyed. It also allowed Lee to shift his defensive forces to meet each offensive.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=174}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===Morning phase===\n''Location'': '''''Northern end of the battlefield'''''\n[[File:Antietam0600.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Assaults by the I Corps, '''5:30 to 7:30 a.m.''']]\n\n====Cornfield====\n\nThe battle opened at dawn (about 5:30&nbsp;a.m.) on September 17 with an attack down the Hagerstown Turnpike by the Union I Corps under Joseph Hooker. Hooker's objective was the plateau on which sat the Dunker Church, a modest whitewashed building belonging to a local sect of [[German Baptists]]. Hooker had approximately 8,600 men, little more than the 7,700 defenders under Stonewall Jackson, and this slight disparity was more than offset by the Confederates' strong defensive positions.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=181}} Abner Doubleday's division moved on Hooker's right, James Ricketts's moved on the left into the East Woods, and George Meade's [[Pennsylvania Reserves]] division deployed in the center and slightly to the rear. Jackson's defense consisted of the divisions under Alexander Lawton and John R. Jones in line from the West Woods, across the Turnpike, and along the southern end of Miller's Cornfield. Four brigades were held in reserve inside the West Woods.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=60}}\n\nAs the first Union men emerged from the North Woods and into the [[Miller's Cornfield|Cornfield]], an artillery duel erupted. Confederate fire was from the horse artillery batteries under Jeb Stuart to the west and four batteries under Col. [[Stephen D. Lee]] on the high ground across the pike from the Dunker Church to the south. Union return fire was from nine batteries on the ridge behind the North Woods and twenty 20-pounder [[Parrott rifle]]s, 2 miles (3&nbsp;km) east of Antietam Creek. The conflagration caused heavy casualties on both sides and was described by Col. Lee as \"artillery Hell.\"{{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=190\u201391}}\n\nSeeing the glint of Confederate bayonets concealed in the Cornfield, Hooker halted his infantry and brought up four batteries of artillery, which fired shell and canister over the heads of the Federal infantry into the field. A savage battle began, with considerable melee action with rifle butts and bayonets due to short visibility in the corn. Officers rode about cursing and yelling orders no one could hear in the noise. Rifles became hot and fouled from too much firing; the air was filled with a hail of bullets and shells.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=70}}\n\n[[File:Bodies on the battlefield at antietam.jpg|thumb|right|Dead Confederate soldiers from Starke's Louisiana Brigade, on the Hagerstown Turnpike, north of the Dunker Church.

Truman Seymour, began advancing through the East Woods and exchanged fire with Colonel James Walker's brigade of Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina troops. As Walker's men forced Seymour's back, aided by Lee's artillery fire, Ricketts's division entered the Cornfield, also to be torn up by artillery. Brig. Gen. Abram Dury\u00e9e's brigade marched directly into volleys from Colonel Marcellus Douglass's Georgia brigade. Enduring heavy fire from a range of {{convert|250|yd|m|-1}} and gaining no advantage because of a lack of reinforcements, Dury\u00e9e ordered a withdrawal.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=60}}\n\nThe reinforcements that Dury\u00e9e had expected&mdash;brigades under Brig. Gen. George L. Hartsuff and Col. William A. Christian&mdash;had difficulties reaching the scene. Hartsuff was wounded by a shell, and Christian dismounted and fled to the rear in terror. When the men were rallied and advanced into the Cornfield, they met the same artillery and infantry fire as their predecessors. As the superior Union numbers began to tell, the Louisiana \"Tiger\" Brigade under Harry Hays entered the fray and forced the Union men back to the East Woods. The casualties received by the 12th Massachusetts Infantry, 67%, were the highest of any unit that day.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=61}} The Tigers were beaten back eventually when the Federals brought up a battery of [[Field Artillery in the American Civil War|3-inch ordnance rifles]] and rolled them directly into the Cornfield, point-blank fire that slaughtered the Tigers, who lost 323 of their 500 men.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|pp=71\u201373}}\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=...the most deadly fire of the war.

Brig. Gen. John Gibbon's 4th Brigade of Doubleday's division (recently named the [[Iron Brigade]]) began advancing down and astride the turnpike, into the cornfield, and in the West Woods, pushing aside Jackson's men.{{sfn|Dawes|1999|pp=88\u201391}} They were halted by a charge of 1,150 men from Starke's brigade, leveling heavy fire from {{convert|30|yd|m|-1}} away.

Although the cost was steep, Hooker's corps was making steady progress.\n\nConfederate reinforcements arrived just after 7 a.m. The divisions under McLaws and Richard H. Anderson arrived following a night march from Harpers Ferry. Around 7:15, General Lee moved George T. Anderson's Georgia brigade from the right flank of the army to aid Jackson. At 7 a.m., Hood's division of 2,300 men advanced through the West Woods and pushed the Union troops back through the Cornfield again. The Texans attacked with particular ferocity because as they were called from their reserve position they were forced to interrupt the first hot breakfast they had had in days. They were aided by three brigades of D.H. Hill's division arriving from the Mumma Farm, southeast of the Cornfield, and by Jubal Early's brigade, pushing through the West Woods from the Nicodemus Farm, where they had been supporting Jeb Stuart's horse artillery. Some officers of the Iron Brigade rallied men around the artillery pieces of Battery B, 4th U.S. Artillery, and Gibbon himself saw to it that his previous unit did not lose a single caisson.{{sfn|Dawes|1999|pp=91\u201393}} Hood's men bore the brunt of the fighting, however, and paid a heavy price&mdash;60% casualties&mdash;but they were able to prevent the defensive line from crumbling and held off the I Corps. When asked by a fellow officer where his division was, Hood replied, \"Dead on the field.\"{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=79}}\n\nHooker's men had also paid heavily but without achieving their objectives. After two hours and 2,500 casualties, they were back where they started. The Cornfield, an area about {{convert|250|yd|m|-1}} deep and {{convert|400|yd|m|-2}} wide, was a scene of indescribable destruction.

Although he was a veteran of 40 years' service, he had never led large numbers of soldiers in combat. Concerned that his men would bolt under fire, he marched them in a formation that was known as \"column of companies, closed in mass,\" a bunched-up formation in which a regiment was arrayed ten ranks deep instead of the normal two. As his men entered the East Woods, they presented an excellent artillery target, \"almost as good a target as a barn.\" Mansfield himself was shot in the chest and died the next day. Alpheus Williams assumed temporary command of the XII Corps.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|pp=79\u201380}}{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=206}}\n\nThe new recruits of Mansfield's 1st Division made no progress against Hood's line, which was reinforced by brigades of D.H.

The 2nd Division of the XII Corps, under George Sears Greene, however, broke through McRae's men, who fled under the mistaken belief that they were about to be trapped by a [[flanking maneuver|flanking attack]]. This breach of the line forced Hood and his men, outnumbered, to regroup in the West Woods, where they had started the day.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=61}} Greene was able to reach the Dunker Church, Hooker's original objective, and drove off Stephen Lee's batteries.

Command of his I Corps fell to General Meade, since Hooker's senior subordinate, James B. Ricketts, had also been wounded. But with Hooker removed from the field, there was no general left with the authority to rally the men of the I and XII Corps. Greene's men came under heavy fire from the West Woods and withdrew from the Dunker Church.\n\n[[File:DunkerChurchAntietam1862.jpg|thumb|left|The Dunker Church after September 17, 1862.

Sedgwick's division of 5,400 men was the first to ford the Antietam, and they entered the East Woods with the intention of turning left and forcing the Confederates south into the assault of Ambrose Burnside's IX Corps. But the plan went awry. They became separated from William H. French's division, and at 9 a.m. Sumner, who was accompanying the division, launched the attack with an unusual battle formation&mdash;the three brigades in three long lines, men side-by-side, with only 50 to {{convert|70|yd|m|-1}} separating the lines. They were assaulted first by Confederate artillery and then from three sides by the divisions of Early, Walker, and McLaws, and in less than half an hour Sedgwick's men were forced to retreat in great disorder to their starting point with over 2,200 casualties, including Sedgwick himself, who was taken out of action for several months by a wound.{{sfn|Armstrong|2002|pp=3\u201327}}{{sfn|Eicher|2001|pp=353\u201355}}{{sfn|Wolff|2000|pp=61\u201362}}{{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=221\u201330}} Sumner has been condemned by most historians for his \"reckless\" attack, his lack of coordination with the I and XII Corps headquarters, losing control of French's division when he accompanied Sedgwick's, failing to perform adequate reconnaissance prior to launching his attack, and selecting the unusual battle formation that was so effectively flanked by the Confederate counterattack. Historian M. V. Armstrong's recent scholarship, however, has determined that Sumner did perform appropriate reconnaissance and his decision to attack where he did was justified by the information available to him.{{sfn|Armstrong|2002|pp=39\u201355}}\n\nThe final actions in the morning phase of the battle were around 10 a.m., when two regiments of the XII Corps advanced, only to be confronted by the division of John G. Walker, newly arrived from the Confederate right. They fought in the area between the Cornfield in the West Woods, but soon Walker's men were forced back by two brigades of Greene's division, and the Federal troops seized some ground in the West Woods.\n\nThe morning phase ended with casualties on both sides of almost 13,000, including two Union corps commanders.<ref>Kennedy, p. 120.</ref>\n\n===Midday phase===\n''Location'': '''''Center of the Confederate line'''''\n\n====Sunken Road: \"''Bloody Lane''\"====\n[[File:Antietam0900.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Assaults by the XII and II Corps, '''9 a.m. to 1 p.m.''']]\n\nBy midday, the action had shifted to the center of the Confederate line. Sumner had accompanied the morning attack of Sedgwick's division, but another of his divisions, under French, lost contact with Sumner and Sedgwick and inexplicably headed south. Eager for an opportunity to see combat, French found skirmishers in his path and ordered his men forward. By this time, Sumner's aide (and son) located French, described the terrible fighting in the West Woods and relayed an order for him to divert Confederate attention by attacking their center.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=93}}\n\nFrench confronted D.H. Hill's division. Hill commanded about 2,500 men, less than half the number under French, and three of his five brigades had been torn up during the morning combat. This sector of Longstreet's line was theoretically the weakest. But Hill's men were in a strong defensive position, atop a gradual ridge, in a sunken road worn down by years of wagon traffic, which formed a natural trench.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=94}}\n\nFrench launched a series of brigade-sized assaults against Hill's improvised breastworks at around 9:30&nbsp;a.m.. The first brigade to attack, mostly inexperienced troops commanded by Brig. Gen. Max Weber, was quickly cut down by heavy rifle fire; neither side deployed artillery at this point. The second attack, more raw recruits under Col. Dwight Morris, was also subjected to heavy fire but managed to beat back a counterattack by the Alabama Brigade of Robert Rodes. The third, under Brig. Gen. Nathan Kimball, included three veteran regiments, but they also fell to fire from the sunken road. French's division suffered 1,750 casualties (of his 5,700 men) in under an hour.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=63}}\n\nReinforcements were arriving on both sides, and by 10:30&nbsp;a.m. Robert E. Lee sent his final reserve division&mdash;some 3,400 men under Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson&mdash;to bolster Hill's line and extend it to the right, preparing an attack that would envelop French's left flank. But at the same time, the 4,000 men of Maj. Gen. Israel B. Richardson's division arrived on French's left. This was the last of Sumner's three divisions, which had been held up in the rear by McClellan as he organized his reserve forces.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=99}} Richardson's fresh troops struck the first blow.\n\n[[File:Antietam Sunken Road.JPG|thumb|left|Sunken Road]]\nLeading off the fourth attack of the day against the sunken road was the [[Irish Brigade (United States)|Irish Brigade]] of Brig. Gen. Thomas F. Meagher. As they advanced with emerald green flags snapping in the breeze, a regimental chaplain, Father [[William Corby]], rode back and forth across the front of the formation shouting words of conditional [[absolution]] prescribed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] for those who were about to die. (Corby would later perform a similar service at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] in 1863.) The mostly [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants lost 540 men to heavy volleys before they were ordered to withdraw.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=100}}\n\nGen. Richardson personally dispatched the brigade of Brig. Gen. [[John C. Caldwell]] into battle around noon (after being told that Caldwell was in the rear, behind a haystack), and finally the tide turned. Anderson's Confederate division had been little help to the defenders after Gen. Anderson was wounded early in the fighting. Other key leaders were lost as well, including George B. Anderson (no relation; Anderson's successor, Col. [[Charles Courtenay Tew|Charles C. Tew]] of the 2nd North Carolina, was killed minutes after assuming command){{sfn|Bailey|1984|pp=101\u201303}} and Col. [[John B. Gordon]] of the 6th Alabama. (Gordon received 5 serious wounds in the fight, twice in his right leg, twice in the left arm, and once in the face. He lay unconscious, face down in his cap, and later told colleagues that he should have smothered in his own blood, except for the act of an unidentified Yankee, who had earlier shot a hole in his cap, which allowed the blood to drain.){{sfn|Sears|1983|p=242}} Rodes was wounded in the thigh but was still on the field. These losses contributed directly to the confusion of the following events.\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=We were shooting them like sheep in a pen.

[[Francis C. Barlow]] and 350 men of the [[61st New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st]] and [[64th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|64th New York]] saw a weak point in the line and seized a knoll commanding the sunken road. This allowed them to get [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire into the Confederate line, turning it into a deadly trap. In attempting to wheel around to meet this threat, a command from Rodes was misunderstood by Lt. Col. James N. Lightfoot, who had succeeded the unconscious John Gordon. Lightfoot ordered his men to about-face and march away, an order that all five regiments of the brigade thought applied to them as well. Confederate troops streamed toward Sharpsburg, their line lost.\n\n[[File:Bloodylane.JPG|thumb|left|The Bloody Lane in 2005]]\n\nRichardson's men were in hot pursuit when massed artillery hastily assembled by Gen. Longstreet drove them back. A counterattack with 200 men led by D.H. Hill got around the Federal left flank near the sunken road, and although they were driven back by a fierce charge of the 5th New Hampshire, this stemmed the collapse of the center. Reluctantly, Richardson ordered his division to fall back to north of the ridge facing the sunken road. His division lost about 1,000 men. Col. Barlow was severely wounded, and Richardson mortally wounded.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=254}} Winfield S. Hancock assumed division command. Although Hancock would have an excellent future reputation as an aggressive division and corps commander, the unexpected change of command sapped the momentum of the Federal advance.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=108}}\n\n[[File:BloodyLaneAntietam.jpg|thumb|Confederate dead lie in the \"Bloody Lane\" after the Battle of Antietam, 1862.]]\nThe carnage from 9:30&nbsp;a.m. to 1:00&nbsp;p.m. on the sunken road gave it the name ''Bloody Lane'', leaving about 5,600 casualties (Union 3,000, Confederate 2,600) along the {{convert|800|yd|m|-2|adj=on}} road. And yet a great opportunity presented itself. If this broken sector of the Confederate line were exploited, Lee's army would have been divided in half and possibly defeated. There were ample forces available to do so. There was a reserve of 3,500 cavalry and the 10,300 infantrymen of Gen. Porter's V Corps, waiting near the middle bridge, a mile away. The VI Corps had just arrived with 12,000 men. Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin of the VI Corps was ready to exploit this breakthrough, but Sumner, the senior corps commander, ordered him not to advance. Franklin appealed to McClellan, who left his headquarters in the rear to hear both arguments but backed Sumner's decision, ordering Franklin and Hancock to hold their positions.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|pp=108\u201309}}\n\nLater in the day, the commander of the other reserve unit near the center, the V Corps, Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter, heard recommendations from Maj. Gen. George Sykes, commanding his 2nd Division, that another attack be made in the center, an idea that intrigued McClellan. However, Porter is said to have told McClellan, \"Remember, General, I command the last reserve of the last Army of the Republic.\" McClellan demurred and another opportunity was lost.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=141}}\n\n===Afternoon phase===\n''Location'': '''''Southern end of the battlefield'''''\n\n====\"Burnside's Bridge\"====\n[[File:Antietam1000.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Assaults by the IX Corps, '''10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.''']]\n\nThe action moved to the southern end of the battlefield. McClellan's plan called for Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]] and the IX Corps to conduct a diversionary attack in support of Hooker's I Corps, hoping to draw Confederate attention away from the intended main attack in the north. However, Burnside was instructed to wait for explicit orders before launching his attack, and those orders did not reach him until 10 a.m.<ref>Jamieson, p. 94. McClellan issued the order at 9:10, ''after'' the repulse of Hooker's and Mansfield's assaults, having waited for the VI Corps to reach the battlefield and take up a reserve position.</ref> Burnside was strangely passive during preparations for the battle. He was disgruntled that McClellan had abandoned the previous arrangement of \"wing\" commanders reporting to him. Previously, Burnside had commanded a wing that included both the I and IX Corps and now he was responsible only for the IX Corps. Implicitly refusing to give up his higher authority, Burnside treated first Maj. Gen. [[Jesse L. Reno]] (killed at South Mountain) and then Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox of the Kanawha Division as the corps commander, funneling orders to the corps through him.\n\nBurnside had four divisions (12,500 troops) and 50 guns east of Antietam Creek. Facing him was a force that had been greatly depleted by Lee's movement of units to bolster the Confederate left flank. At dawn, the divisions of Brig. Gens. David R. Jones and John G. Walker stood in defense, but by 10 a.m. all of Walker's men and Col. George T. Anderson's Georgia brigade had been removed. Jones had only about 3,000 men and 12 guns available to meet Burnside. Four thin brigades guarded the ridges near Sharpsburg, primarily a low plateau known as Cemetery Hill. The remaining 400 men&mdash;the 2nd and 20th Georgia regiments, under the command of Brig. Gen. Robert Toombs, with two artillery batteries&mdash;defended Rohrbach's Bridge, a three-span, 125-foot (38 m) stone structure that was the southernmost crossing of the Antietam.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=64}} It would become known to history as ''[[Burnside's Bridge]]'' because of the notoriety of the coming battle. The bridge was a difficult objective. The road leading to it ran parallel to the creek and was exposed to enemy fire. The bridge was dominated by a 100-foot (30 m) high wooded bluff on the west bank, strewn with boulders from an old quarry, making infantry and sharpshooter fire from good covered positions a dangerous impediment to crossing.\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=Go and look at [Burnside's Bridge], and tell me if you don't think Burnside and his corps might have executed a hop, skip, and jump and landed on the other side.

Burnside has been widely criticized for ignoring this fact.{{sfn|Douglas|1940|p=172}} However, the commanding terrain across the sometimes shallow creek made crossing the water a comparatively easy part of a difficult problem. Burnside concentrated his plan instead on storming the bridge while simultaneously crossing a ford McClellan's engineers had identified a half mile (1&nbsp;km) downstream, but when Burnside's men reached it, they found the banks too high to negotiate. While Col. George Crook's Ohio brigade prepared to attack the bridge with the support of Brig. Gen. Samuel Sturgis's division, the rest of the Kanawha Division and Brig. Gen. Isaac Rodman's division struggled through thick brush trying to locate Snavely's Ford, 2 miles (3&nbsp;km) downstream, intending to flank the Confederates.{{sfn|Eicher|2001|pp=359\u201360}}{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=64}}{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=260}}\n\nCrook's assault on the bridge was led by skirmishers from the 11th Connecticut, who were ordered to clear the bridge for the Ohioans to cross and assault the bluff. After receiving punishing fire for 15 minutes, the Connecticut men withdrew with 139 casualties, one-third of their strength, including their commander, Col. Henry W. Kingsbury, who was fatally wounded.<ref>Tucker, p. 87.</ref> Crook's main assault went awry when his unfamiliarity with the terrain caused his men to reach the creek a quarter mile (400 m) upstream from the bridge, where they exchanged volleys with Confederate skirmishers for the next few hours.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=263}}\n\nWhile Rodman's division was out of touch, slogging toward Snavely's Ford, Burnside and Cox directed a second assault at the bridge by one of Sturgis's brigades, led by the [[2nd Maryland Volunteer Infantry|2nd Maryland]] and [[6th New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry|6th New Hampshire]]. They also fell prey to the Confederate sharpshooters and artillery, and their attack fell apart.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=120}} By this time it was noon, and McClellan was losing patience. He sent a succession of couriers to motivate Burnside to move forward. He ordered one aide, \"Tell him if it costs 10,000 men he must go now.\" He increased the pressure by sending his inspector general, Col. [[Delos Bennett Sackett|Delos B. Sackett]], to confront Burnside, who reacted indignantly: \"McClellan appears to think I am not trying my best to carry this bridge; you are the third or fourth one who has been to me this morning with similar orders.\"{{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=264\u201365}}\n\nThe third attempt to take the bridge was at 12:30&nbsp;p.m. by Sturgis's other brigade, commanded by Brig. Gen. Edward Ferrero. It was led by the 51st New York and the [[51st Pennsylvania Infantry|51st Pennsylvania]], who, with adequate artillery support and a promise that a recently canceled whiskey ration would be restored if they were successful, charged downhill and took up positions on the east bank. Maneuvering a captured light howitzer into position, they fired double canister down the bridge and got within {{convert|25|yd|m|0}} of the enemy. By 1 p.m., Confederate ammunition was running low, and word reached Toombs that Rodman's men were crossing Snavely's Ford on their flank. He ordered a withdrawal. His Georgians had cost the Federals more than 500 casualties, giving up fewer than 160 themselves. And they had stalled Burnside's assault on the southern flank for more than three hours.{{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=266\u201367}}{{sfn|Bailey|1984|pp=125\u201326}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Edwin Forbes - The Charge across the Burnside Bridge.jpg|<center>Charge of the 51st New York and 51st Pennsylvania across Burnside's Bridge, by [[Edwin Forbes]]</center>\nFile:Battle of Antietam2.jpg|<center>''Battle of Antietam'' by Kurz and Allison</center>\nFile:BurnsideBridge01a.jpg|<center>Confederate guns on the hill above poured fire into the Union ranks at Burnside's bridge.

His officers had neglected to transport ammunition across the bridge, which was itself becoming a bottleneck for soldiers, artillery, and wagons. This represented another two-hour delay. Gen. Lee used this time to bolster his right flank. He ordered up every available artillery unit, although he made no attempt to strengthen D.R. Jones's badly outnumbered force with infantry units from the left. Instead, he counted on the arrival of A.P. Hill's Light Division, currently embarked on an exhausting 17 mile (27&nbsp;km) march from Harpers Ferry. By 2 p.m., Hill's men had reached Boteler's Ford, and Hill was able to confer with the relieved Lee at 2:30, who ordered him to bring up his men to the right of Jones.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=276}}\n\nThe Federals were completely unaware that 3,000 new men would be facing them. Burnside's plan was to move around the weakened Confederate right flank, converge on Sharpsburg, and cut Lee's army off from Boteler's Ford, their only escape route across the Potomac. At 3 p.m., Burnside left Sturgis's division in reserve on the west bank and moved west with over 8,000 troops (most of them fresh) and 22 guns for close support.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=131}}\n\nAn initial assault led by the [[79th New York|79th New York \"Cameron Highlanders\"]] succeeded against Jones's outnumbered division, which was pushed back past Cemetery Hill and to within {{convert|200|yd|m|-2}} of Sharpsburg. Farther to the left, Rodman's division advanced toward Harpers Ferry Road. Its lead brigade, under Col. Harrison Fairchild, containing several colorful [[Zouave]]s of the [[9th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|9th New York]], commanded by Col. Rush Hawkins, came under heavy shellfire from a dozen enemy guns mounted on a ridge to their front, but they kept pushing forward. There was panic in the streets of Sharpsburg, clogged with retreating Confederates. Of the five brigades in Jones's division, only Toombs's brigade was still intact, but he had only 700 men.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|pp=132\u201336}}\n\nA. P. Hill's division arrived at 3:30&nbsp;p.m. Hill divided his column, with two brigades moving southeast to guard his flank and the other three, about 2,000 men, moving to the right of Toombs's brigade and preparing for a counterattack. At 3:40&nbsp;p.m., Brig. Gen. Maxcy Gregg's brigade of South Carolinians attacked the 16th Connecticut on Rodman's left flank in the cornfield of farmer John Otto. The Connecticut men had been in service for only three weeks, and their line disintegrated with 185 casualties. The 4th Rhode Island came up on the right, but they had poor visibility amid the high stalks of corn, and they were disoriented because many of the Confederates were wearing Union uniforms captured at Harpers Ferry. They also broke and ran, leaving the 8th Connecticut far out in advance and isolated. They were enveloped and driven down the hills toward Antietam Creek. A counterattack by regiments from the Kanawha Division fell short.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|pp=136\u201337}}\n\nThe IX Corps had suffered casualties of about 20% but still possessed twice the number of Confederates confronting them. Unnerved by the collapse of his flank, Burnside ordered his men all the way back to the west bank of the Antietam, where he urgently requested more men and guns. McClellan was able to provide just one battery. He said, \"I can do nothing more. I have no infantry.\" In fact, however, McClellan had two fresh corps in reserve, Porter's V and Franklin's VI, but he was too cautious, concerned he was greatly outnumbered and that a massive counterstrike by Lee was imminent. Burnside's men spent the rest of the day guarding the bridge they had suffered so much to capture.{{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=291\u201392}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n[[File:Confederate dead gathered for burial at Antietam.jpg|right|thumb|Confederate dead gathered for burial after the battle.<ref name=Frassanito105>Site identified by Frassanito, pp. 105&ndash;108.</ref> Photograph by Alexander Gardner.]]\n[[File:Lincoln and McClellan 1862-10-03.jpg|thumb|Photograph by [[Alexander Gardner (photographer)|Alexander Gardner]] of [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and [[George B.

Antietam ranks fifth in terms of total casualties in Civil War battles, falling behind Gettysburg, [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]], [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], and [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania Court House]].\n\nPresident Lincoln was disappointed in McClellan's performance. He believed that McClellan's overly cautious and poorly coordinated actions in the field had forced the battle to a draw rather than a crippling Confederate defeat.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=296}} The president was even more astonished that from September 17 to October 26, despite repeated entreaties from the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] and the president himself, McClellan declined to pursue Lee across the Potomac, citing shortages of equipment and the fear of overextending his forces. General-in-Chief [[Henry W. Halleck]] wrote in his official report, \"The long inactivity of so large an army in the face of a defeated foe, and during the most favorable season for rapid movements and a vigorous campaign, was a matter of great disappointment and regret.\"{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=67}} Lincoln relieved McClellan of his command of the Army of the Potomac on November 5, effectively ending the general's military career. He was replaced on November 9 by General Burnside.{{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=338-339}}\n{{external media| float = right| width = 230px | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?281066-1/crossroads-freedom-antietam Presentation by James McPherson on ''Crossroads of Freedom: Antietam'', September 11, 2008], [[C-SPAN]]}}\nSome students of history question the designation of \"strategic victory\" for the Union. After all, it can be argued that McClellan performed poorly in the campaign and the battle itself, and Lee displayed great generalship in holding his own in battle against an army that greatly outnumbered his. Casualties were comparable on both sides, although Lee lost a higher percentage of his army. Lee withdrew from the battlefield first, the technical definition of the tactical loser in a Civil War battle. However, in a [[military strategy|strategic]] sense, despite being a tactical draw, Antietam is considered a [[Turning Point of the American Civil War|turning point of the war]] and a victory for the Union because it ended Lee's strategic campaign (his first invasion of Union territory). American historian [[James M. McPherson]] summed up the importance of the Battle of Antietam in his book, ''Crossroads of Freedom'':\n\n{{Quotation|No other campaign and battle in the war had such momentous, multiple consequences as Antietam. In July 1863 the dual Union triumphs at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] struck another blow that blunted a renewed Confederate offensive in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|East]] and cut off the western third of the Confederacy from the rest. In September 1864 Sherman's [[Atlanta campaign|capture of Atlanta]] electrified the North and set the stage for the final drive to Union victory. These also were pivotal moments. But they would never have happened if the triple Confederate offensives in [[Second Battle of Corinth|Mississippi]], [[Confederate Heartland Offensive|Kentucky]], and most of all Maryland had not been defeated in the fall of 1862.{{sfn|McPherson|2002|p=155}}}}\n\nThe results of Antietam also allowed President Lincoln to issue the preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on September 22, which gave Confederate states until January 1, 1863, to return or else lose their slaves. Although Lincoln had intended to do so earlier, he was advised by his Cabinet to make this announcement after a Union victory to avoid the perception that it was issued out of desperation.\n\nThe Union victory and Lincoln's proclamation played a considerable role in dissuading the governments of France and Britain from recognizing the Confederacy; some suspected they were planning to do so in the aftermath of another Union defeat. When the issue of emancipation was linked to the progress of the war, neither government had the political will to oppose the United States, since it linked support of the Confederacy to support for slavery. Both countries had already abolished slavery, and the public would not have tolerated the government militarily supporting a sovereignty upholding the ideals of slavery.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=318}}\n\n==Battlefield preservation==\n\nThe battle is commemorated at [[Antietam National Battlefield]]. Conservation work undertaken by Antietam National Battlefield and private groups, has earned Antietam a reputation as one of the nation's best preserved Civil War battlefields. Few visual intrusions mar the landscape, letting visitors experience the site nearly as it was in 1862.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/16/nation/la-na-antietam-anniversary-20120916|title=Preservationists see victory at Antietam 150 years later|work=latimes|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAntietam was one of the first five Civil War battlefields preserved federally, receiving that distinction on August 30, 1890. The [[United States Department of War|U.S. War Department]] also placed over 300 tablets at that time to mark the spots of individual regiments and of significant phases in the battle. The battlefield was transferred to the [[Department of the Interior]] in 1933. The Antietam National Battlefield now consists of 2,743 acres.\n\nThe [[Civil War Trust]] (a division of the [[American Battlefield Trust]]) and its partners have acquired and preserved 316 acres of the Antietam Battlefield.<ref>[https://www.battlefields.org/preserve/saved-land] [[American Battlefield Trust]] \"Saved Land\" webpage.

There are hundreds of photos in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] taken by Brady and his associates from numerous Civil War sites.</ref> to photograph the carnage. In October 1862 Brady displayed the photos by Gardner in an exhibition entitled \"The Dead of Antietam\" at Brady's New York gallery. Many images in this presentation were graphic photographs of corpses, a presentation new to America.

Lee|Robert E. Lee's]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]] and Union General [[George B. McClellan|George B. McClellan's]] [[Army of the Potomac]], near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland]] and [[Antietam Creek]]. Part of the [[Maryland Campaign]], it was the first [[field army]]\u2013level engagement in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War]] to take place on Union soil. It was the bloodiest day in United States military history, with a combined tally of 22,717 dead, wounded, or missing.{{sfn|McPherson|2002|p=3}}\n\nAfter pursuing the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] general [[Robert E. Lee]] into [[Maryland]], [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George B. McClellan]] of the [[Union Army]] launched attacks against Lee's army, in defensive positions behind Antietam Creek. At dawn on September 17, Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]]'s corps mounted a powerful assault on Lee's left flank.  Attacks and counterattacks swept across Miller's Cornfield, and fighting swirled around the [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Dunker Church]]. Union assaults against the Sunken Road eventually pierced the Confederate center, but the Federal advantage was not followed up. In the afternoon, Union Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]'s corps entered the action, capturing a stone bridge over Antietam Creek and advancing against the Confederate right. At a crucial moment, Confederate Maj. Gen. [[A. P. Hill]]'s division arrived from [[Harpers Ferry]] and launched a surprise counterattack, driving back Burnside and ending the battle. Although outnumbered two-to-one, Lee committed his entire force, while McClellan sent in less than three-quarters of his army, enabling Lee to fight the Federals to a standstill. During the night, both armies consolidated their lines. In spite of crippling casualties, Lee continued to skirmish with McClellan throughout September 18, while removing his battered army south of the [[Potomac River]].<ref>[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/md003.htm NPS].</ref>\n\nDespite having superiority of numbers, McClellan's attacks failed to achieve [[force concentration]]. This allowed Lee to counter by shifting forces and moving along [[interior lines]] to meet each challenge. This is why  McClellan failed to destroy Lee's army even though he had ample reserve forces that he could have deployed to exploit localized successes. McClellan persisted in his erroneous belief that he was outnumbered. This contributed to his cautiousness throughout the campaign.\n\nMcClellan had halted Lee's invasion of Maryland, but Lee was able to withdraw his army back to [[Virginia]] without interference from the cautious McClellan. McClellan's refusal to pursue Lee's army led to his removal from command by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] in November. Although the battle was [[Tactical victory|tactically]] inconclusive, the Confederate troops had withdrawn first from the battlefield, and abandoned their invasion, making it a Union strategic victory. It was a sufficiently significant victory to give Lincoln the confidence to announce his [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which, by freeing more than 3.5 million [[slaves]] in the Confederate states, began the process of [[emancipation]] of all remaining persons considered, legally, as slaves within the [[United States]], and in doing so, discouraged the British and French governments, which were heavily opposed to slavery, and had in fact abolished slavery in their respective nations prior to the [[American Civil War]], from pursuing any potential plans to recognize the Confederacy.\n\n==Background: Maryland Campaign==\n{{Main|Maryland Campaign}}\n{{further|Peninsula Campaign|Seven Days Battles|Northern Virginia Campaign|Second Battle of Bull Run|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|American Civil War}}\n\n[[File:Maryland Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Maryland Campaign, actions '''September 3 to 15''', 1862\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n\nRobert E. Lee's [[Army of Northern Virginia]]&mdash;about 55,000 men{{sfn|McPherson|2002|p=100}}{{sfn|Eicher|2001|p=337}}<ref>Sears, p. 69 \"perhaps 50,000\".</ref>&mdash;entered the state of [[Maryland]] on September 3, 1862, following their victory at [[Second Bull Run]] on August 30. Emboldened by success, the Confederate leadership intended to take the war into enemy territory. Lee's invasion of Maryland was intended to run simultaneously with an invasion of Kentucky by the armies of [[Braxton Bragg]] and [[Edmund Kirby Smith]]. It was also necessary for logistical reasons, as northern Virginia's farms had been stripped bare of food. Based on events such as the [[Baltimore riot of 1861|Baltimore riots]] in the spring of 1861 and the fact that President Lincoln had to pass through the city in disguise en route to his inauguration, Confederate leaders assumed that Maryland would welcome the Confederate forces warmly. They sang the tune \"[[Maryland, My Maryland]]!\" as they marched, but by the fall of 1862 pro-Union sentiment was winning out, especially in the western parts of the state. Civilians generally hid inside their houses as Lee's army passed through their towns, or watched in cold silence, while the [[Army of the Potomac]] was cheered and encouraged. Some Confederate politicians, including [[President of the Confederate States of America|President]] [[Jefferson Davis]], believed that the prospect of foreign recognition would increase if the Confederacy won a military victory on Union soil; such a victory might gain recognition and financial support from the United Kingdom and France, although there is no evidence that Lee thought the Confederacy should base its military plans on this possibility.{{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=65\u201366}}{{sfn|McPherson|2002|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nWhile McClellan's 87,000-man<ref name=USA-strength/> [[Army of the Potomac]] was moving to intercept Lee, two Union soldiers (Corporal Barton W. Mitchell and First Sergeant [[John M. Bloss]]{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=112}}{{sfn|McPherson|2002|p=108}} of the 27th Indiana Volunteer Infantry) discovered a mislaid copy of Lee's detailed battle plans&mdash;[[Special Order 191]]&mdash;wrapped around three cigars. The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically (to [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]], and [[Hagerstown, Maryland]]), thus making each subject to isolation and defeat if McClellan could move quickly enough. McClellan waited about 18 hours before deciding to take advantage of this intelligence and reposition his forces, thus squandering an opportunity to defeat Lee decisively.{{sfn|McPherson|2002|p=109}}\n\nThere were two significant engagements in the Maryland campaign prior to the major battle of Antietam: Maj. Gen. [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson's]] capture of [[Battle of Harpers Ferry|Harpers Ferry]] and McClellan's assault through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] in the [[Battle of South Mountain]]. The former was significant because a large portion of Lee's army was absent from the start of the battle of Antietam, attending to the surrender of the Union garrison; the latter because stout Confederate defenses at two passes through the mountains delayed McClellan's advance enough for Lee to concentrate the remainder of his army at Sharpsburg.{{sfn|McPherson|2002|pp=110\u201312}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n{{further|Antietam Union order of battle}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Opposing army commanders\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=\"2\" widths=90>\nFile:George B McClellan - retouched.jpg|<center>Maj.

Although most histories, including the [[Official Records of the American Civil War|Official Records]], refer to these organizations as Corps, that designation was not formally made until November 6, 1862, after the Maryland Campaign. Longstreet's unit was referred to as the Right Wing, Jackson's the Left Wing, for most of 1862. (Gen. Lee referred in official correspondence to these as \"commands\". See, for instance, Luvaas and Nelson, p. 4. Lee used this term because a Confederate law forbade the creation of army corps. It had been intended as a states' rights measure to ensure that governors would retain some control over the troops from their state, and Lee lobbied strongly for repeal of this law.) Harsh, ''Sounding the Shallows'', pp. 32&ndash;90, states that D.H. Hill was temporarily in command of a \"Center Wing\" with his own division commanded initially by Brig. Gen. [[Roswell S.

[[William N. Pendleton]]. The Second Corps was organized with artillery attached to each division, in contrast to the First Corps, which reserved its artillery at the corps level.\n\n==Prelude to battle==\n\n===Disposition of armies===\n[[File:US ARMY MARYLAND CAMPAIGN MAP 4 (ANTIETAM).jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Battlefield of Antietam, situation '''September 15 to 16''', 1862]]\n[[File:Antietam Overview.png|thumb|upright=1.8|right|'''Overview''' of the Battle of Antietam]]\n\nNear the town of Sharpsburg, Lee deployed his available forces behind Antietam Creek along a low ridge, starting on September 15. While it was an effective defensive position, it was not an impregnable one. The terrain provided excellent cover for infantrymen, with rail and stone fences, outcroppings of [[limestone]], little hollows and [[wikt:swale|swales]]. The creek to their front was only a minor barrier, ranging from 60 to 100 feet (18&ndash;30 m) in width, and was fordable in places and crossed by three stone bridges each a mile (1.5&nbsp;km) apart. It was also a precarious position because the Confederate rear was blocked by the [[Potomac River]] and only a single crossing point, Boteler's Ford at [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia|Shepherdstown]], was nearby should retreat be necessary. (The ford at [[Williamsport, Maryland]], was {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} northwest from Sharpsburg and had been used by Jackson in his march to Harpers Ferry. The disposition of Union forces during the battle made it impractical to consider retreating in that direction.) And on September 15, the force under Lee's immediate command consisted of no more than 18,000 men, only a third the size of the Federal army.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=60}}\n\nThe first two Union divisions arrived on the afternoon of September 15 and the bulk of the remainder of the army late that evening. Although an immediate Union attack on the morning of September 16 would have had an overwhelming advantage in numbers, McClellan's trademark caution and his belief that Lee had as many as 100,000 men at Sharpsburg caused him to delay his attack for a day.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=174}} This gave the Confederates more time to prepare defensive positions and allowed Longstreet's corps to arrive from Hagerstown and Jackson's corps, minus A.P. Hill's division, to arrive from Harpers Ferry. Jackson defended the left (northern) flank, anchored on the Potomac, Longstreet the right (southern) flank, anchored on the Antietam, a line that was about 4 miles (6&nbsp;km) long. (As the battle progressed and Lee shifted units, these corps boundaries overlapped considerably.){{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=164, 175\u201376}}\n\nOn the evening of September 16, McClellan ordered Hooker's I Corps to cross Antietam Creek and probe the enemy positions. Meade's division cautiously attacked Hood's troops near the East Woods. After darkness fell, artillery fire continued as McClellan positioned his troops for the next day's fighting. McClellan's plan was to overwhelm the enemy's left flank. He arrived at this decision because of the configuration of bridges over the Antietam. The lower bridge (which would soon be named Burnside Bridge) was dominated by Confederate positions on the bluffs overlooking it. The middle bridge, on the road from [[Boonsboro, Maryland|Boonsboro]], was subject to artillery fire from the heights near Sharpsburg. But the upper bridge was 2 miles (3&nbsp;km) east of the Confederate guns and could be crossed safely. McClellan planned to commit more than half his army to the assault, starting with two corps, supported by a third, and if necessary a fourth. He intended to launch a simultaneous diversionary attack against the Confederate right with a fifth corps, and he was prepared to strike the center with his reserves if either attack succeeded.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=63}} The skirmish in the East Woods served to signal McClellan's intentions to Lee, who prepared his defenses accordingly. He shifted men to his left flank and sent urgent messages to his two commanders who had not yet arrived on the battlefield: Lafayette McLaws with two divisions and A.P. Hill with one division.<ref>Harsh, ''Taken at the Flood'', pp. 366&ndash;67</ref>{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=174}}\n\n===Terrain and its consequences===\nMcClellan's plans were ill-coordinated and were executed poorly. He issued to each of his subordinate commanders only the orders for his own corps, not general orders describing the entire battle plan. The terrain of the battlefield made it difficult for those commanders to monitor events outside of their sectors. Moreover, McClellan's headquarters were more than a mile in the rear (at the Philip Pry house, east of the creek). This made it difficult for him to control the separate corps. This is why the battle progressed the next day as essentially three separate, mostly uncoordinated battles: morning in the northern end of the battlefield, midday in the center, and afternoon in the south. This lack of coordination and concentration of McClellan's forces almost completely nullified the two-to-one advantage the Union enjoyed. It also allowed Lee to shift his defensive forces to meet each offensive.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=174}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===Morning phase===\n''Location'': '''''Northern end of the battlefield'''''\n[[File:Antietam0600.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Assaults by the I Corps, '''5:30 to 7:30 a.m.''']]\n\n====Cornfield====\n\nThe battle opened at dawn (about 5:30&nbsp;a.m.) on September 17 with an attack down the Hagerstown Turnpike by the Union I Corps under Joseph Hooker. Hooker's objective was the plateau on which sat the Dunker Church, a modest whitewashed building belonging to a local sect of [[German Baptists]]. Hooker had approximately 8,600 men, little more than the 7,700 defenders under Stonewall Jackson, and this slight disparity was more than offset by the Confederates' strong defensive positions.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=181}} Abner Doubleday's division moved on Hooker's right, James Ricketts's moved on the left into the East Woods, and George Meade's [[Pennsylvania Reserves]] division deployed in the center and slightly to the rear. Jackson's defense consisted of the divisions under Alexander Lawton and John R. Jones in line from the West Woods, across the Turnpike, and along the southern end of Miller's Cornfield. Four brigades were held in reserve inside the West Woods.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=60}}\n\nAs the first Union men emerged from the North Woods and into the [[Miller's Cornfield|Cornfield]], an artillery duel erupted. Confederate fire was from the horse artillery batteries under Jeb Stuart to the west and four batteries under Col. [[Stephen D. Lee]] on the high ground across the pike from the Dunker Church to the south. Union return fire was from nine batteries on the ridge behind the North Woods and twenty 20-pounder [[Parrott rifle]]s, 2 miles (3&nbsp;km) east of Antietam Creek. The conflagration caused heavy casualties on both sides and was described by Col. Lee as \"artillery Hell.\"{{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=190\u201391}}\n\nSeeing the glint of Confederate bayonets concealed in the Cornfield, Hooker halted his infantry and brought up four batteries of artillery, which fired shell and canister over the heads of the Federal infantry into the field. A savage battle began, with considerable melee action with rifle butts and bayonets due to short visibility in the corn. Officers rode about cursing and yelling orders no one could hear in the noise. Rifles became hot and fouled from too much firing; the air was filled with a hail of bullets and shells.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=70}}\n\n[[File:Bodies on the battlefield at antietam.jpg|thumb|right|Dead Confederate soldiers from Starke's Louisiana Brigade, on the Hagerstown Turnpike, north of the Dunker Church.

Truman Seymour, began advancing through the East Woods and exchanged fire with Colonel James Walker's brigade of Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina troops. As Walker's men forced Seymour's back, aided by Lee's artillery fire, Ricketts's division entered the Cornfield, also to be torn up by artillery. Brig. Gen. Abram Dury\u00e9e's brigade marched directly into volleys from Colonel Marcellus Douglass's Georgia brigade. Enduring heavy fire from a range of {{convert|250|yd|m|-1}} and gaining no advantage because of a lack of reinforcements, Dury\u00e9e ordered a withdrawal.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=60}}\n\nThe reinforcements that Dury\u00e9e had expected&mdash;brigades under Brig. Gen. George L. Hartsuff and Col. William A. Christian&mdash;had difficulties reaching the scene. Hartsuff was wounded by a shell, and Christian dismounted and fled to the rear in terror. When the men were rallied and advanced into the Cornfield, they met the same artillery and infantry fire as their predecessors. As the superior Union numbers began to tell, the Louisiana \"Tiger\" Brigade under Harry Hays entered the fray and forced the Union men back to the East Woods. The casualties received by the 12th Massachusetts Infantry, 67%, were the highest of any unit that day.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=61}} The Tigers were beaten back eventually when the Federals brought up a battery of [[Field Artillery in the American Civil War|3-inch ordnance rifles]] and rolled them directly into the Cornfield, point-blank fire that slaughtered the Tigers, who lost 323 of their 500 men.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|pp=71\u201373}}\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=...the most deadly fire of the war.

Brig. Gen. John Gibbon's 4th Brigade of Doubleday's division (recently named the [[Iron Brigade]]) began advancing down and astride the turnpike, into the cornfield, and in the West Woods, pushing aside Jackson's men.{{sfn|Dawes|1999|pp=88\u201391}} They were halted by a charge of 1,150 men from Starke's brigade, leveling heavy fire from {{convert|30|yd|m|-1}} away. The Confederate brigade withdrew after being exposed to fierce return fire from the Iron Brigade, and Starke was mortally wounded.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=75}} The Union advance on the Dunker Church resumed and cut a large gap in Jackson's defensive line, which teetered near collapse. Although the cost was steep, Hooker's corps was making steady progress.\n\nConfederate reinforcements arrived just after 7 a.m. The divisions under McLaws and Richard H. Anderson arrived following a night march from Harpers Ferry. Around 7:15, General Lee moved George T. Anderson's Georgia brigade from the right flank of the army to aid Jackson. At 7 a.m., Hood's division of 2,300 men advanced through the West Woods and pushed the Union troops back through the Cornfield again. The Texans attacked with particular ferocity because as they were called from their reserve position they were forced to interrupt the first hot breakfast they had had in days. They were aided by three brigades of D.H. Hill's division arriving from the Mumma Farm, southeast of the Cornfield, and by Jubal Early's brigade, pushing through the West Woods from the Nicodemus Farm, where they had been supporting Jeb Stuart's horse artillery. Some officers of the Iron Brigade rallied men around the artillery pieces of Battery B, 4th U.S. Artillery, and Gibbon himself saw to it that his previous unit did not lose a single caisson.{{sfn|Dawes|1999|pp=91\u201393}} Hood's men bore the brunt of the fighting, however, and paid a heavy price&mdash;60% casualties&mdash;but they were able to prevent the defensive line from crumbling and held off the I Corps. When asked by a fellow officer where his division was, Hood replied, \"Dead on the field.\"{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=79}}\n\nHooker's men had also paid heavily but without achieving their objectives. After two hours and 2,500 casualties, they were back where they started. The Cornfield, an area about {{convert|250|yd|m|-1}} deep and {{convert|400|yd|m|-2}} wide, was a scene of indescribable destruction. It was estimated that the Cornfield changed hands no fewer than 15 times in the course of the morning.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=91}} Major [[Rufus Dawes|Rufus R. Dawes]], who assumed command of Iron Brigade's 6th Wisconsin Regiment during the battle, later compared the fighting around the Hagerstown Turnpike with the stone wall at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania's]] \"Bloody Angle\", and the slaughter pen of [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], insisting that \"the Antietam Turnpike surpassed them all in manifest evidence of slaughter.\"{{sfn|Dawes|1999|p=95}} Hooker called for support from the 7,200 men of Mansfield's XII Corps.\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=... every stalk of corn in the northern and greater part of the field was cut as closely as could have been done with a knife, and the [Confederates] slain lay in rows precisely as they had stood in their ranks a few moments before.\n|source=Maj.

Although he was a veteran of 40 years' service, he had never led large numbers of soldiers in combat. Concerned that his men would bolt under fire, he marched them in a formation that was known as \"column of companies, closed in mass,\" a bunched-up formation in which a regiment was arrayed ten ranks deep instead of the normal two. As his men entered the East Woods, they presented an excellent artillery target, \"almost as good a target as a barn.\" Mansfield himself was shot in the chest and died the next day. Alpheus Williams assumed temporary command of the XII Corps.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|pp=79\u201380}}{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=206}}\n\nThe new recruits of Mansfield's 1st Division made no progress against Hood's line, which was reinforced by brigades of D.H. Hill's division under Colquitt and McRae. The 2nd Division of the XII Corps, under George Sears Greene, however, broke through McRae's men, who fled under the mistaken belief that they were about to be trapped by a [[flanking maneuver|flanking attack]]. This breach of the line forced Hood and his men, outnumbered, to regroup in the West Woods, where they had started the day.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=61}} Greene was able to reach the Dunker Church, Hooker's original objective, and drove off Stephen Lee's batteries. Federal forces held most of the ground to the east of the turnpike.\n\nHooker attempted to gather the scattered remnants of his I Corps to continue the assault, but a Confederate sharpshooter spotted the general's conspicuous white horse and shot Hooker through the foot. Command of his I Corps fell to General Meade, since Hooker's senior subordinate, James B. Ricketts, had also been wounded. But with Hooker removed from the field, there was no general left with the authority to rally the men of the I and XII Corps. Greene's men came under heavy fire from the West Woods and withdrew from the Dunker Church.\n\n[[File:DunkerChurchAntietam1862.jpg|thumb|left|The Dunker Church after September 17, 1862. Here, both Union and Confederate dead lie together on the field.]]\n\nIn an effort to turn the Confederate left flank and relieve the pressure on Mansfield's men, Sumner's II Corps was ordered at 7:20&nbsp;a.m. to send two divisions into battle. Sedgwick's division of 5,400 men was the first to ford the Antietam, and they entered the East Woods with the intention of turning left and forcing the Confederates south into the assault of Ambrose Burnside's IX Corps. But the plan went awry. They became separated from William H. French's division, and at 9 a.m. Sumner, who was accompanying the division, launched the attack with an unusual battle formation&mdash;the three brigades in three long lines, men side-by-side, with only 50 to {{convert|70|yd|m|-1}} separating the lines. They were assaulted first by Confederate artillery and then from three sides by the divisions of Early, Walker, and McLaws, and in less than half an hour Sedgwick's men were forced to retreat in great disorder to their starting point with over 2,200 casualties, including Sedgwick himself, who was taken out of action for several months by a wound.{{sfn|Armstrong|2002|pp=3\u201327}}{{sfn|Eicher|2001|pp=353\u201355}}{{sfn|Wolff|2000|pp=61\u201362}}{{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=221\u201330}} Sumner has been condemned by most historians for his \"reckless\" attack, his lack of coordination with the I and XII Corps headquarters, losing control of French's division when he accompanied Sedgwick's, failing to perform adequate reconnaissance prior to launching his attack, and selecting the unusual battle formation that was so effectively flanked by the Confederate counterattack. Historian M. V. Armstrong's recent scholarship, however, has determined that Sumner did perform appropriate reconnaissance and his decision to attack where he did was justified by the information available to him.{{sfn|Armstrong|2002|pp=39\u201355}}\n\nThe final actions in the morning phase of the battle were around 10 a.m., when two regiments of the XII Corps advanced, only to be confronted by the division of John G. Walker, newly arrived from the Confederate right. They fought in the area between the Cornfield in the West Woods, but soon Walker's men were forced back by two brigades of Greene's division, and the Federal troops seized some ground in the West Woods.\n\nThe morning phase ended with casualties on both sides of almost 13,000, including two Union corps commanders.<ref>Kennedy, p. 120.</ref>\n\n===Midday phase===\n''Location'': '''''Center of the Confederate line'''''\n\n====Sunken Road: \"''Bloody Lane''\"====\n[[File:Antietam0900.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Assaults by the XII and II Corps, '''9 a.m. to 1 p.m.''']]\n\nBy midday, the action had shifted to the center of the Confederate line. Sumner had accompanied the morning attack of Sedgwick's division, but another of his divisions, under French, lost contact with Sumner and Sedgwick and inexplicably headed south. Eager for an opportunity to see combat, French found skirmishers in his path and ordered his men forward. By this time, Sumner's aide (and son) located French, described the terrible fighting in the West Woods and relayed an order for him to divert Confederate attention by attacking their center.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=93}}\n\nFrench confronted D.H. Hill's division. Hill commanded about 2,500 men, less than half the number under French, and three of his five brigades had been torn up during the morning combat. This sector of Longstreet's line was theoretically the weakest. But Hill's men were in a strong defensive position, atop a gradual ridge, in a sunken road worn down by years of wagon traffic, which formed a natural trench.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=94}}\n\nFrench launched a series of brigade-sized assaults against Hill's improvised breastworks at around 9:30&nbsp;a.m.. The first brigade to attack, mostly inexperienced troops commanded by Brig. Gen. Max Weber, was quickly cut down by heavy rifle fire; neither side deployed artillery at this point. The second attack, more raw recruits under Col. Dwight Morris, was also subjected to heavy fire but managed to beat back a counterattack by the Alabama Brigade of Robert Rodes. The third, under Brig. Gen. Nathan Kimball, included three veteran regiments, but they also fell to fire from the sunken road. French's division suffered 1,750 casualties (of his 5,700 men) in under an hour.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=63}}\n\nReinforcements were arriving on both sides, and by 10:30&nbsp;a.m. Robert E. Lee sent his final reserve division&mdash;some 3,400 men under Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson&mdash;to bolster Hill's line and extend it to the right, preparing an attack that would envelop French's left flank. But at the same time, the 4,000 men of Maj. Gen. Israel B. Richardson's division arrived on French's left. This was the last of Sumner's three divisions, which had been held up in the rear by McClellan as he organized his reserve forces.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=99}} Richardson's fresh troops struck the first blow.\n\n[[File:Antietam Sunken Road.JPG|thumb|left|Sunken Road]]\nLeading off the fourth attack of the day against the sunken road was the [[Irish Brigade (United States)|Irish Brigade]] of Brig. Gen. Thomas F. Meagher. As they advanced with emerald green flags snapping in the breeze, a regimental chaplain, Father [[William Corby]], rode back and forth across the front of the formation shouting words of conditional [[absolution]] prescribed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] for those who were about to die. (Corby would later perform a similar service at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] in 1863.) The mostly [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants lost 540 men to heavy volleys before they were ordered to withdraw.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=100}}\n\nGen. Richardson personally dispatched the brigade of Brig. Gen. [[John C. Caldwell]] into battle around noon (after being told that Caldwell was in the rear, behind a haystack), and finally the tide turned. Anderson's Confederate division had been little help to the defenders after Gen. Anderson was wounded early in the fighting. Other key leaders were lost as well, including George B. Anderson (no relation; Anderson's successor, Col. [[Charles Courtenay Tew|Charles C. Tew]] of the 2nd North Carolina, was killed minutes after assuming command){{sfn|Bailey|1984|pp=101\u201303}} and Col. [[John B. Gordon]] of the 6th Alabama. (Gordon received 5 serious wounds in the fight, twice in his right leg, twice in the left arm, and once in the face. He lay unconscious, face down in his cap, and later told colleagues that he should have smothered in his own blood, except for the act of an unidentified Yankee, who had earlier shot a hole in his cap, which allowed the blood to drain.){{sfn|Sears|1983|p=242}} Rodes was wounded in the thigh but was still on the field. These losses contributed directly to the confusion of the following events.\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=We were shooting them like sheep in a pen.

[[Francis C. Barlow]] and 350 men of the [[61st New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st]] and [[64th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|64th New York]] saw a weak point in the line and seized a knoll commanding the sunken road. This allowed them to get [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire into the Confederate line, turning it into a deadly trap. In attempting to wheel around to meet this threat, a command from Rodes was misunderstood by Lt. Col. James N. Lightfoot, who had succeeded the unconscious John Gordon. Lightfoot ordered his men to about-face and march away, an order that all five regiments of the brigade thought applied to them as well. Confederate troops streamed toward Sharpsburg, their line lost.\n\n[[File:Bloodylane.JPG|thumb|left|The Bloody Lane in 2005]]\n\nRichardson's men were in hot pursuit when massed artillery hastily assembled by Gen. Longstreet drove them back. A counterattack with 200 men led by D.H. Hill got around the Federal left flank near the sunken road, and although they were driven back by a fierce charge of the 5th New Hampshire, this stemmed the collapse of the center. Reluctantly, Richardson ordered his division to fall back to north of the ridge facing the sunken road. His division lost about 1,000 men. Col. Barlow was severely wounded, and Richardson mortally wounded.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=254}} Winfield S. Hancock assumed division command. Although Hancock would have an excellent future reputation as an aggressive division and corps commander, the unexpected change of command sapped the momentum of the Federal advance.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=108}}\n\n[[File:BloodyLaneAntietam.jpg|thumb|Confederate dead lie in the \"Bloody Lane\" after the Battle of Antietam, 1862.]]\nThe carnage from 9:30&nbsp;a.m. to 1:00&nbsp;p.m. on the sunken road gave it the name ''Bloody Lane'', leaving about 5,600 casualties (Union 3,000, Confederate 2,600) along the {{convert|800|yd|m|-2|adj=on}} road. And yet a great opportunity presented itself. If this broken sector of the Confederate line were exploited, Lee's army would have been divided in half and possibly defeated. There were ample forces available to do so. There was a reserve of 3,500 cavalry and the 10,300 infantrymen of Gen. Porter's V Corps, waiting near the middle bridge, a mile away. The VI Corps had just arrived with 12,000 men. Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin of the VI Corps was ready to exploit this breakthrough, but Sumner, the senior corps commander, ordered him not to advance. Franklin appealed to McClellan, who left his headquarters in the rear to hear both arguments but backed Sumner's decision, ordering Franklin and Hancock to hold their positions.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|pp=108\u201309}}\n\nLater in the day, the commander of the other reserve unit near the center, the V Corps, Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter, heard recommendations from Maj. Gen. George Sykes, commanding his 2nd Division, that another attack be made in the center, an idea that intrigued McClellan. However, Porter is said to have told McClellan, \"Remember, General, I command the last reserve of the last Army of the Republic.\" McClellan demurred and another opportunity was lost.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=141}}\n\n===Afternoon phase===\n''Location'': '''''Southern end of the battlefield'''''\n\n====\"Burnside's Bridge\"====\n[[File:Antietam1000.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Assaults by the IX Corps, '''10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.''']]\n\nThe action moved to the southern end of the battlefield. McClellan's plan called for Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]] and the IX Corps to conduct a diversionary attack in support of Hooker's I Corps, hoping to draw Confederate attention away from the intended main attack in the north. However, Burnside was instructed to wait for explicit orders before launching his attack, and those orders did not reach him until 10 a.m.<ref>Jamieson, p. 94. McClellan issued the order at 9:10, ''after'' the repulse of Hooker's and Mansfield's assaults, having waited for the VI Corps to reach the battlefield and take up a reserve position.</ref> Burnside was strangely passive during preparations for the battle. He was disgruntled that McClellan had abandoned the previous arrangement of \"wing\" commanders reporting to him. Previously, Burnside had commanded a wing that included both the I and IX Corps and now he was responsible only for the IX Corps. Implicitly refusing to give up his higher authority, Burnside treated first Maj. Gen. [[Jesse L. Reno]] (killed at South Mountain) and then Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox of the Kanawha Division as the corps commander, funneling orders to the corps through him.\n\nBurnside had four divisions (12,500 troops) and 50 guns east of Antietam Creek. Facing him was a force that had been greatly depleted by Lee's movement of units to bolster the Confederate left flank. At dawn, the divisions of Brig. Gens. David R. Jones and John G. Walker stood in defense, but by 10 a.m. all of Walker's men and Col. George T. Anderson's Georgia brigade had been removed. Jones had only about 3,000 men and 12 guns available to meet Burnside. Four thin brigades guarded the ridges near Sharpsburg, primarily a low plateau known as Cemetery Hill. The remaining 400 men&mdash;the 2nd and 20th Georgia regiments, under the command of Brig. Gen. Robert Toombs, with two artillery batteries&mdash;defended Rohrbach's Bridge, a three-span, 125-foot (38 m) stone structure that was the southernmost crossing of the Antietam.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=64}} It would become known to history as ''[[Burnside's Bridge]]'' because of the notoriety of the coming battle. The bridge was a difficult objective. The road leading to it ran parallel to the creek and was exposed to enemy fire. The bridge was dominated by a 100-foot (30 m) high wooded bluff on the west bank, strewn with boulders from an old quarry, making infantry and sharpshooter fire from good covered positions a dangerous impediment to crossing.\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=Go and look at [Burnside's Bridge], and tell me if you don't think Burnside and his corps might have executed a hop, skip, and jump and landed on the other side.

Burnside has been widely criticized for ignoring this fact.{{sfn|Douglas|1940|p=172}} However, the commanding terrain across the sometimes shallow creek made crossing the water a comparatively easy part of a difficult problem. Burnside concentrated his plan instead on storming the bridge while simultaneously crossing a ford McClellan's engineers had identified a half mile (1&nbsp;km) downstream, but when Burnside's men reached it, they found the banks too high to negotiate. While Col. George Crook's Ohio brigade prepared to attack the bridge with the support of Brig. Gen. Samuel Sturgis's division, the rest of the Kanawha Division and Brig. Gen. Isaac Rodman's division struggled through thick brush trying to locate Snavely's Ford, 2 miles (3&nbsp;km) downstream, intending to flank the Confederates.{{sfn|Eicher|2001|pp=359\u201360}}{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=64}}{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=260}}\n\nCrook's assault on the bridge was led by skirmishers from the 11th Connecticut, who were ordered to clear the bridge for the Ohioans to cross and assault the bluff. After receiving punishing fire for 15 minutes, the Connecticut men withdrew with 139 casualties, one-third of their strength, including their commander, Col. Henry W. Kingsbury, who was fatally wounded.<ref>Tucker, p. 87.</ref> Crook's main assault went awry when his unfamiliarity with the terrain caused his men to reach the creek a quarter mile (400 m) upstream from the bridge, where they exchanged volleys with Confederate skirmishers for the next few hours.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=263}}\n\nWhile Rodman's division was out of touch, slogging toward Snavely's Ford, Burnside and Cox directed a second assault at the bridge by one of Sturgis's brigades, led by the [[2nd Maryland Volunteer Infantry|2nd Maryland]] and [[6th New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry|6th New Hampshire]]. They also fell prey to the Confederate sharpshooters and artillery, and their attack fell apart.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=120}} By this time it was noon, and McClellan was losing patience. He sent a succession of couriers to motivate Burnside to move forward. He ordered one aide, \"Tell him if it costs 10,000 men he must go now.\" He increased the pressure by sending his inspector general, Col. [[Delos Bennett Sackett|Delos B. Sackett]], to confront Burnside, who reacted indignantly: \"McClellan appears to think I am not trying my best to carry this bridge; you are the third or fourth one who has been to me this morning with similar orders.\"{{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=264\u201365}}\n\nThe third attempt to take the bridge was at 12:30&nbsp;p.m. by Sturgis's other brigade, commanded by Brig. Gen. Edward Ferrero. It was led by the 51st New York and the [[51st Pennsylvania Infantry|51st Pennsylvania]], who, with adequate artillery support and a promise that a recently canceled whiskey ration would be restored if they were successful, charged downhill and took up positions on the east bank. Maneuvering a captured light howitzer into position, they fired double canister down the bridge and got within {{convert|25|yd|m|0}} of the enemy. By 1 p.m., Confederate ammunition was running low, and word reached Toombs that Rodman's men were crossing Snavely's Ford on their flank. He ordered a withdrawal. His Georgians had cost the Federals more than 500 casualties, giving up fewer than 160 themselves. And they had stalled Burnside's assault on the southern flank for more than three hours.{{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=266\u201367}}{{sfn|Bailey|1984|pp=125\u201326}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Edwin Forbes - The Charge across the Burnside Bridge.jpg|<center>Charge of the 51st New York and 51st Pennsylvania across Burnside's Bridge, by [[Edwin Forbes]]</center>\nFile:Battle of Antietam2.jpg|<center>''Battle of Antietam'' by Kurz and Allison</center>\nFile:BurnsideBridge01a.jpg|<center>Confederate guns on the hill above poured fire into the Union ranks at Burnside's bridge.

His officers had neglected to transport ammunition across the bridge, which was itself becoming a bottleneck for soldiers, artillery, and wagons. This represented another two-hour delay. Gen. Lee used this time to bolster his right flank. He ordered up every available artillery unit, although he made no attempt to strengthen D.R. Jones's badly outnumbered force with infantry units from the left. Instead, he counted on the arrival of A.P. Hill's Light Division, currently embarked on an exhausting 17 mile (27&nbsp;km) march from Harpers Ferry. By 2 p.m., Hill's men had reached Boteler's Ford, and Hill was able to confer with the relieved Lee at 2:30, who ordered him to bring up his men to the right of Jones.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=276}}\n\nThe Federals were completely unaware that 3,000 new men would be facing them. Burnside's plan was to move around the weakened Confederate right flank, converge on Sharpsburg, and cut Lee's army off from Boteler's Ford, their only escape route across the Potomac. At 3 p.m., Burnside left Sturgis's division in reserve on the west bank and moved west with over 8,000 troops (most of them fresh) and 22 guns for close support.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=131}}\n\nAn initial assault led by the [[79th New York|79th New York \"Cameron Highlanders\"]] succeeded against Jones's outnumbered division, which was pushed back past Cemetery Hill and to within {{convert|200|yd|m|-2}} of Sharpsburg. Farther to the left, Rodman's division advanced toward Harpers Ferry Road. Its lead brigade, under Col. Harrison Fairchild, containing several colorful [[Zouave]]s of the [[9th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|9th New York]], commanded by Col. Rush Hawkins, came under heavy shellfire from a dozen enemy guns mounted on a ridge to their front, but they kept pushing forward. There was panic in the streets of Sharpsburg, clogged with retreating Confederates. Of the five brigades in Jones's division, only Toombs's brigade was still intact, but he had only 700 men.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|pp=132\u201336}}\n\nA. P. Hill's division arrived at 3:30&nbsp;p.m. Hill divided his column, with two brigades moving southeast to guard his flank and the other three, about 2,000 men, moving to the right of Toombs's brigade and preparing for a counterattack. At 3:40&nbsp;p.m., Brig. Gen. Maxcy Gregg's brigade of South Carolinians attacked the 16th Connecticut on Rodman's left flank in the cornfield of farmer John Otto. The Connecticut men had been in service for only three weeks, and their line disintegrated with 185 casualties. The 4th Rhode Island came up on the right, but they had poor visibility amid the high stalks of corn, and they were disoriented because many of the Confederates were wearing Union uniforms captured at Harpers Ferry. They also broke and ran, leaving the 8th Connecticut far out in advance and isolated. They were enveloped and driven down the hills toward Antietam Creek. A counterattack by regiments from the Kanawha Division fell short.{{sfn|Bailey|1984|pp=136\u201337}}\n\nThe IX Corps had suffered casualties of about 20% but still possessed twice the number of Confederates confronting them. Unnerved by the collapse of his flank, Burnside ordered his men all the way back to the west bank of the Antietam, where he urgently requested more men and guns. McClellan was able to provide just one battery. He said, \"I can do nothing more. I have no infantry.\" In fact, however, McClellan had two fresh corps in reserve, Porter's V and Franklin's VI, but he was too cautious, concerned he was greatly outnumbered and that a massive counterstrike by Lee was imminent. Burnside's men spent the rest of the day guarding the bridge they had suffered so much to capture.{{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=291\u201392}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n[[File:Confederate dead gathered for burial at Antietam.jpg|right|thumb|Confederate dead gathered for burial after the battle.<ref name=Frassanito105>Site identified by Frassanito, pp. 105&ndash;108.</ref> Photograph by Alexander Gardner.]]\n[[File:Lincoln and McClellan 1862-10-03.jpg|thumb|Photograph by [[Alexander Gardner (photographer)|Alexander Gardner]] of [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and [[George B.

Antietam is sometimes cited as the bloodiest day in all of American history, but the deaths from the [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]] are significantly higher.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The bloodiest battle in American history was [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], but its more than 46,000 casualties occurred over three days. Antietam ranks fifth in terms of total casualties in Civil War battles, falling behind Gettysburg, [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]], [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], and [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania Court House]].\n\nPresident Lincoln was disappointed in McClellan's performance. He believed that McClellan's overly cautious and poorly coordinated actions in the field had forced the battle to a draw rather than a crippling Confederate defeat.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=296}} The president was even more astonished that from September 17 to October 26, despite repeated entreaties from the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] and the president himself, McClellan declined to pursue Lee across the Potomac, citing shortages of equipment and the fear of overextending his forces. General-in-Chief [[Henry W. Halleck]] wrote in his official report, \"The long inactivity of so large an army in the face of a defeated foe, and during the most favorable season for rapid movements and a vigorous campaign, was a matter of great disappointment and regret.\"{{sfn|Bailey|1984|p=67}} Lincoln relieved McClellan of his command of the Army of the Potomac on November 5, effectively ending the general's military career. He was replaced on November 9 by General Burnside.{{sfn|Sears|1983|pp=338-339}}\n{{external media| float = right| width = 230px | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?281066-1/crossroads-freedom-antietam Presentation by James McPherson on ''Crossroads of Freedom: Antietam'', September 11, 2008], [[C-SPAN]]}}\nSome students of history question the designation of \"strategic victory\" for the Union. After all, it can be argued that McClellan performed poorly in the campaign and the battle itself, and Lee displayed great generalship in holding his own in battle against an army that greatly outnumbered his. Casualties were comparable on both sides, although Lee lost a higher percentage of his army. Lee withdrew from the battlefield first, the technical definition of the tactical loser in a Civil War battle. However, in a [[military strategy|strategic]] sense, despite being a tactical draw, Antietam is considered a [[Turning Point of the American Civil War|turning point of the war]] and a victory for the Union because it ended Lee's strategic campaign (his first invasion of Union territory). American historian [[James M. McPherson]] summed up the importance of the Battle of Antietam in his book, ''Crossroads of Freedom'':\n\n{{Quotation|No other campaign and battle in the war had such momentous, multiple consequences as Antietam. In July 1863 the dual Union triumphs at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] struck another blow that blunted a renewed Confederate offensive in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|East]] and cut off the western third of the Confederacy from the rest. In September 1864 Sherman's [[Atlanta campaign|capture of Atlanta]] electrified the North and set the stage for the final drive to Union victory. These also were pivotal moments. But they would never have happened if the triple Confederate offensives in [[Second Battle of Corinth|Mississippi]], [[Confederate Heartland Offensive|Kentucky]], and most of all Maryland had not been defeated in the fall of 1862.{{sfn|McPherson|2002|p=155}}}}\n\nThe results of Antietam also allowed President Lincoln to issue the preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on September 22, which gave Confederate states until January 1, 1863, to return or else lose their slaves. Although Lincoln had intended to do so earlier, he was advised by his Cabinet to make this announcement after a Union victory to avoid the perception that it was issued out of desperation.\n\nThe Union victory and Lincoln's proclamation played a considerable role in dissuading the governments of France and Britain from recognizing the Confederacy; some suspected they were planning to do so in the aftermath of another Union defeat. When the issue of emancipation was linked to the progress of the war, neither government had the political will to oppose the United States, since it linked support of the Confederacy to support for slavery. Both countries had already abolished slavery, and the public would not have tolerated the government militarily supporting a sovereignty upholding the ideals of slavery.{{sfn|Sears|1983|p=318}}\n\n==Battlefield preservation==\n\nThe battle is commemorated at [[Antietam National Battlefield]].

This was also the youngest delegation in Puerto Rico's Olympic history, with half the team under the age of 25, and many of them were expected to reach their peak in time for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Four Puerto Rican athletes had competed in Beijing, including track star and pre-Olympic favorite [[Javier Culson]], who held the record as the \"world's fastest man\" in the hurdles, and later became the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony. [[Canterbury Christ Church University]] had been selected as the team's preparation base for these Olympic games.\n\nThese Games tied as Puerto Rico's most successful Olympics, winning a total of two medals, and tying the record for the most medals with [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles]] at a single games. Javier Culson won the nation's first ever medal in the men's hurdles and their first bronze in 16 years. Meanwhile, [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] born [[Jaime Espinal]] became the first Puerto Rican athlete to claim an Olympic silver medal in men's freestyle [[wrestling]], and set a historic Olympic record as the nation's second silver medalist, 28 years after [[Luis Ortiz (Puerto Rican boxer)|Luis Ortiz]] had become the first.\n\n==Medalists==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

to August 12, 2012. This was the nation's seventeenth consecutive appearance at the Olympics.\n\n[[Puerto Rico Olympic Committee|Comit\u00e9 Ol\u00edmpico de Puerto Rico]] sent a total of 25 athletes to the Games, 19 men and 6 women, to compete in 8 sports. The nation's team size was roughly larger by three athletes from [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing]]. This was also the youngest delegation in Puerto Rico's Olympic history, with half the team under the age of 25, and many of them were expected to reach their peak in time for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Four Puerto Rican athletes had competed in Beijing, including track star and pre-Olympic favorite [[Javier Culson]], who held the record as the \"world's fastest man\" in the hurdles, and later became the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony. [[Canterbury Christ Church University]] had been selected as the team's preparation base for these Olympic games.\n\nThese Games tied as Puerto Rico's most successful Olympics, winning a total of two medals, and tying the record for the most medals with [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles]] at a single games. Javier Culson won the nation's first ever medal in the men's hurdles and their first bronze in 16 years. Meanwhile, [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] born [[Jaime Espinal]] became the first Puerto Rican athlete to claim an Olympic silver medal in men's freestyle [[wrestling]], and set a historic Olympic record as the nation's second silver medalist, 28 years after [[Luis Ortiz (Puerto Rican boxer)|Luis Ortiz]] had become the first.\n\n==Medalists==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!
