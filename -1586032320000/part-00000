It is particularly busy with visitors to the [[Camden market]]s at weekends, and is exit-only on Sundays to prevent overcrowding.\n\nNorthbound, the next stations are {{LUL stations|station=Chalk Farm}} on the Edgware branch and {{LUL stations|station=Kentish Town}} on the High Barnet branch. Southbound, the next stations are {{LUL stations|station=Mornington Crescent}} on the Charing Cross branch and {{LUL stations|station=Euston}} on the Bank branch. The station is in [[Travelcard Zone 2]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway===\nThe station was first proposed as part of the original route of the [[Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway]] (CCE&HR) (now part of the Northern line). Proposals for the line had existed since 1893, but construction did not begin until the American entrepreneur [[Charles Tyson Yerkes]] invested in the line in October 1900. Work started in July 1902, and the station was opened on 22 June 1907 by [[David Lloyd George]], then [[President of the Board of Trade]].{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=76-68}} As the line here branched into two routes, to Hampstead and to Highgate, the design of the station was rather unusual, shaped like a V.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The surface building was designed by the [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London]]'s (UERL's) architect [[Leslie Green]].{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=77}} The line to Hampstead (now the Edgware branch) is under [[Chalk Farm Road]]; the line to Highgate (now the High Barnet branch) is under [[Kentish Town Road]]. With the narrowness of the roads above, and the necessity to keep directly beneath them to avoid having to pay compensation to landowners during construction, on both branches the northbound platform is directly above the southbound one.\n\nAt the apex of the V was a junction allowing northbound trains to take either of the branches north, and likewise allow the trains south from the branches to join the single southbound track. This resulted in four connecting tunnels. When the CCE&HR and [[City & South London Railway]] (C&SLR) lines were joined together after the C&SLR became part of the [[Underground Group]] on 1 January 1913,{{sfn|Jackson|Croome|1993|p=122}} a short extension was planned from the Euston terminus of the City & South London Railway to connect with the CCE&HR south of Camden Town station allowing services to run from both City and West End branches to and from the Hampstead and Highgate branches.{{sfn|Follenfant|1975|pp=16-17}} City branch services were extended to this station on 20 April 1924.{{sfn|Leboff|1994|p=28}} The work required to join the two lines together at Camden Town was one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the Underground, and was undertaken without disrupting any existing services.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=94}} It added another four tunnels that allows trains to proceed to or from either the Edgware or High Barnet branch on to or off both the City or Charing Cross branch without following conflicting paths.{{sfn|Jackson|Croome|1993|p=144}} The multiple junction tunnels are effectively located beneath [[Camden High Street]].\n\nThe original lifts and emergency stairs to the platforms were inside the vertex of the V, leading to four passageways, one to each of the platforms, with return passageways back to the lifts. With growing patronage and increasing congestion the lifts were later replaced by escalators that came into service on 7 October 1929 with an escalator heading from the station building to a circulating area at the northern end of the platforms.{{sfn|Leboff|1994|p=28}}  This has only two pairs of parallel passageways, one for each branch (northbound), with a small side passage on each leading to the lower southbound platforms. One set of the original lift passageways became part of the ventilation system, but the remaining one adds to the confusion of the station.\n\n===Northern line===\nThe line, known post-merger for many years as the 'Edgware - Morden' line, was formally referred to as the Northern line from 28 August 1937.{{sfn|Jackson|Croome|1993|p=228}}\n\nThe station was damaged by a bomb on 14 October 1940 during [[the Blitz]]. One person was killed.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=136}} Shortly afterwards, Camden Town was chosen as one of eight stations on the Northern line where dedicated air-raid shelters would be constructed alongside the line, capable of accommodating 640,000 people.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=143}}\n\n===2003 derailment===\nOn 19 October 2003 the points at one of these connecting tunnels was the site of a derailment, which caused damage severe enough to close the line for over a week, although no serious injuries resulted. 1995 tube stock carriages 51722 and 52722 were both seriously damaged by the impact. After the accident, trains were restricted to travelling either from the Edgware branch to the Bank branch or from the High Barnet branch to the Charing Cross branch. This continued for some time, and many considered whether it would be permanent (particularly as this would make managing the two branches through central London easier). However, full use of the junction was restored in March 2004.\n\nA joint report by [[London Underground]] and its maintenance contractor [[Tube Lines]] concluded that poor [[track geometry]] was the main cause of the derailment and extra friction arising out of striations (scratches) on a newly installed set of points had allowed the leading wheel of the last carriage to climb the rail and so derail. The track at the derailment site is on a very tight bend in a tight tunnel bore, which prevents [[Cant (road/rail)|canting]] the track by dipping the height of one rail relative to the other, the normal solution in this sort of situation.\n\n===Future expansion and upgrade===\nThe station is too small for current passenger demand, with just two escalators and too few passageways between Northern line platforms.<ref name=\"upcap1\">{{cite web|url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tube/camden-town-station-upgrade/|title=Improving capacity at Camden Town station|author=|date=2017|website=Transport for London|accessdate=20 February 2018}} Detailed report, with updated timeline etc.</ref> The station particularly busy at weekends with tourists visiting [[Camden Market]] and [[Camden High Street]], with entry to the station prohibited on Sunday afternoons to prevent overcrowding on the station's narrow platforms.

Like its sister station of [[Kennington tube station|Kennington]], the station has four platforms with [[cross-platform interchange]]s available between branches.\n\nHowever, unlike at Kennington, since trains do not terminate at Camden Town, there are no terminus platforms or loop to allow terminating trains to turn around.

It is particularly busy with visitors to the [[Camden market]]s at weekends, and is exit-only on Sundays to prevent overcrowding.\n\nNorthbound, the next stations are {{LUL stations|station=Chalk Farm}} on the Edgware branch and {{LUL stations|station=Kentish Town}} on the High Barnet branch. Southbound, the next stations are {{LUL stations|station=Mornington Crescent}} on the Charing Cross branch and {{LUL stations|station=Euston}} on the Bank branch. The station is in [[Travelcard Zone 2]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway===\nThe station was first proposed as part of the original route of the [[Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway]] (CCE&HR) (now part of the Northern line). Proposals for the line had existed since 1893, but construction did not begin until the American entrepreneur [[Charles Tyson Yerkes]] invested in the line in October 1900. Work started in July 1902, and the station was opened on 22 June 1907 by [[David Lloyd George]], then [[President of the Board of Trade]].{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=76-68}} As the line here branched into two routes, to Hampstead and to Highgate, the design of the station was rather unusual, shaped like a V.{{fact|date=September 2018}} The surface building was designed by the [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London]]'s (UERL's) architect [[Leslie Green]].{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=77}} The line to Hampstead (now the Edgware branch) is under [[Chalk Farm Road]]; the line to Highgate (now the High Barnet branch) is under [[Kentish Town Road]]. With the narrowness of the roads above, and the necessity to keep directly beneath them to avoid having to pay compensation to landowners during construction, on both branches the northbound platform is directly above the southbound one.\n\nAt the apex of the V was a junction allowing northbound trains to take either of the branches north, and likewise allow the trains south from the branches to join the single southbound track. This resulted in four connecting tunnels. When the CCE&HR and [[City & South London Railway]] (C&SLR) lines were joined together after the C&SLR became part of the [[Underground Group]] on 1 January 1913,{{sfn|Jackson|Croome|1993|p=122}} a short extension was planned from the Euston terminus of the City & South London Railway to connect with the CCE&HR south of Camden Town station allowing services to run from both City and West End branches to and from the Hampstead and Highgate branches.{{sfn|Follenfant|1975|pp=16-17}} City branch services were extended to this station on 20 April 1924.{{sfn|Leboff|1994|p=28}} The work required to join the two lines together at Camden Town was one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the Underground, and was undertaken without disrupting any existing services.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=94}} It added another four tunnels that allows trains to proceed to or from either the Edgware or High Barnet branch on to or off both the City or Charing Cross branch without following conflicting paths.{{sfn|Jackson|Croome|1993|p=144}} The multiple junction tunnels are effectively located beneath [[Camden High Street]].\n\nThe original lifts and emergency stairs to the platforms were inside the vertex of the V, leading to four passageways, one to each of the platforms, with return passageways back to the lifts. With growing patronage and increasing congestion the lifts were later replaced by escalators that came into service on 7 October 1929 with an escalator heading from the station building to a circulating area at the northern end of the platforms.{{sfn|Leboff|1994|p=28}}  This has only two pairs of parallel passageways, one for each branch (northbound), with a small side passage on each leading to the lower southbound platforms. One set of the original lift passageways became part of the ventilation system, but the remaining one adds to the confusion of the station.\n\n===Northern line===\nThe line, known post-merger for many years as the 'Edgware - Morden' line, was formally referred to as the Northern line from 28 August 1937.{{sfn|Jackson|Croome|1993|p=228}}\n\nThe station was damaged by a bomb on 14 October 1940 during [[the Blitz]]. One person was killed.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=136}} Shortly afterwards, Camden Town was chosen as one of eight stations on the Northern line where dedicated air-raid shelters would be constructed alongside the line, capable of accommodating 640,000 people.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=143}}\n\n===2003 derailment===\nOn 19 October 2003 the points at one of these connecting tunnels was the site of a derailment, which caused damage severe enough to close the line for over a week, although no serious injuries resulted. 1995 tube stock carriages 51722 and 52722 were both seriously damaged by the impact. After the accident, trains were restricted to travelling either from the Edgware branch to the Bank branch or from the High Barnet branch to the Charing Cross branch. This continued for some time, and many considered whether it would be permanent (particularly as this would make managing the two branches through central London easier). However, full use of the junction was restored in March 2004.\n\nA joint report by [[London Underground]] and its maintenance contractor [[Tube Lines]] concluded that poor [[track geometry]] was the main cause of the derailment and extra friction arising out of striations (scratches) on a newly installed set of points had allowed the leading wheel of the last carriage to climb the rail and so derail. The track at the derailment site is on a very tight bend in a tight tunnel bore, which prevents [[Cant (road/rail)|canting]] the track by dipping the height of one rail relative to the other, the normal solution in this sort of situation.\n\n===Future expansion and upgrade===\nThe station is too small for current passenger demand, with just two escalators and too few passageways between Northern line platforms.<ref name=\"upcap1\">{{cite web|url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tube/camden-town-station-upgrade/|title=Improving capacity at Camden Town station|author=|date=2017|website=Transport for London|accessdate=20 February 2018}} Detailed report, with updated timeline etc.</ref> The station particularly busy at weekends with tourists visiting [[Camden Market]] and [[Camden High Street]], with entry to the station prohibited on Sunday afternoons to prevent overcrowding on the station's narrow platforms.

Sixteen Gypsy Vanner Horses were first imported to the United States starting November 24th, 1996 the day the worlds first registry for the breed was established.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nOne November 24, 1996 the worlds first registry for a breed of horse developed by British Gypsies was founded, it is The Gypsy Vanner Horse Society. The Gypsy Vanner Horse is often, but not always, [[piebald/black and white ]].{{r|johnson|page=314}} It may also be [[skewbald]brown or red and white ] or solid colors. [[equine coat color|colour]]; a solid-coloured horse with [[splashed white|white splashing]] on the underbelly is called \"blagdon\" or if splashed all over it is called Splash blagdon \".{{r|ics1}} There is no coat colour requirement in the [[breed standard]] of the Irish Cob Society,{{r|ics1}} Gypsy Cob Register,{{r|GCregister}} Gypsy Vanner Horse Society,{{r|vanners1}} Gypsy Horse Registry of [[United States|America]], {{r|ghra1}} or Australasian Gypsy Horse Society.{{r|aghs1}} Since the horse originates in the British Isles, British colour names may be used in registration in the [[United States]].{{r|vanners1|gypsyhorseassociation1}} \n[[File:Feather on Horse's Lower Leg.jpg|thumb|Feather on the lower legs]]\n[[File:Solid chestnut coloured Gypsy Cob Horse 1.jpg|thumb|upright|A solid-coloured cob]]\n[[File:GypsyHockSet.jpg|thumb|upright|Hocks of a foal]]\n\nThere are many [[breed registry|breed societies]] for horses raised by Gypsies, with variations in their respective breed standards. The range of desired heights is generally from {{hands|13|to|16}} in the [[United States]] and Australasia,{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1|aghs1}} but in Ireland and continental Europe, the desired height limit goes up to {{hands|16.2}} for some types and they permit both lighter-boned as well as larger horses than typically desired by the American organisations.{{r|ics1|NSVT}}{{efn|name= b}}  Some stud-books have different categories:  The Gypsy Horse Registry of America has two height classifications: Section A for purebred horses under {{hands|14.2}} and Section B for purebred horses {{hands|14.2}} and over. Its Section C is for Gypsy Crossbred horses.{{r|GHRA}}  The Netherlands stud-book for Gypsy horses, the Nederlands Stamboek voor Tinkers, identified there as the \"Tinker horse,\" classifies horses into three groups: \"cob,\" \"vanner,\" and \"grai,\" based on height in metres and degree of refinement. The cob type is approximately {{hands|14.3|to|15.1}}, and the vanner {{hands|15.1|to|16.2}}. The more refined \"grai\" may be of any size but is typically within the 14.3- to 16.2-hand range.{{r|NSVT}}\n\n[[Feathering (horse)|Feathering]], long hair on the legs, is considered a \"characteristic and decorative feature of the Irish Cob\", but is not a requirement for registration.{{r|ics1}}\n\nA Gypsy Horse's facial profile should be straight, neither overly dished nor roman nosed.  A \"sweet\" head, more refined than that of most draught horses, is desired.{{r|lynghaug|page=393-394}} The GHA's breed standard states that the head ''may'' be \"sweet\", \"a small, tidy pony type head\",{{r|gypsyhorses1}} meaning without coarseness and in proportion with the body,{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1}} but the AGHS calls unequivocally for a sweet head, \"more refined than a Shire might have . . . with broad forehead, generous jaw, square muzzle, and even bite\".{{r|aghs1}} According to GVHS, the \"forehead must be flat and broad . . . with [t]he frontal facial bone . . . flat to slightly convex\".{{r|vanners1}}\n\nThe neck is strong, muscular, and of medium length \"with a throat latch slightly deeper than lighter breeds\".{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1|nzgca1}} The chest should be broad, deep, and well muscled.{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1|aghs1|ghra1}}  [[Withers]] are \"well rounded, not high and fine, i.e., hardly noticeable\".{{r|aghs1}} Most standards call for a \"well-sloped\" shoulder {{r|gypsyhorseassociation1|aghs1|nzgca1}} But the GVHS's standard is more precise, specifying a shoulder angle ranging from 45 degrees to 60 degrees.{{r|vanners1}}  The [[back (horse)|back]] is to be short [[Back (horse)|coupled]] with well sprung ribs and a deep heart girth.{{r|aghs1|ghra1}}   The length of line of the belly should be twice that of the topline of the back and the horse should not appear 'wasp waisted'.{{r|gypsyhorses1}} The Dutch breed standard for vanner and cob types requires a strong, well-muscled build with abundant feathering, similar to that of other associations. The \"grai\" is classified as a lighter and more refined riding type.{{r|NSVT}}\n\nStrong hindquarters define the breed as a small draught horse, \"designed for strength and power, but with class, presence and style.\"{{r|vanners1}} They are sometimes described as having an \"apple butt\"{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1|gypsyhorses1}} as the [[rump (animal)|croup]] is well rounded and \"very generous, smooth and broad\".{{r|ghra1}} Poorly-muscled hindquarters or a too-sloping rump are unacceptable.{{r|aghs1}} The line measuring the length of the hip should also be horizontal; if the tailhead falls below the horizontal line intersecting the point of the hip, the horse's \"hip/croup will be approaching too steep an angle for the Gypsy Vanner\".{{r|vanners1}}\n\nBone in the [[limbs of the horse|legs]] should be heavy, clean, and flat.{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1|aghs1|ghra1|gypsyhorses1|nzgca1}} GVHS's standard calls for a length of forearm to cannon ratio of 55% to 45%.{{r|vanners1}} The front legs should be clean and flat in joints as well as bone; front [[pastern]]s should slope at the same angle as the shoulder and should not be short.{{r|gypsyhorses1}} A line drawn from the point of the buttock should touch the back of the hock, run  \"parallel\" to the cannon bone, and touch the  ground directly behind \"the center of the heel\".{{r|vanners1|gypsyhorses1}}  Pastern and hoof angles of the hindlegs are more vertical than the forelegs, usually over 50 degrees.{{r|vanners1}} [[Horse hoof|Hooves]] have strong walls and a well shaped [[frog (horse)|frog]],{{r|ghra1}} round and with wide heels.{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1}}\n\nThe hind legs of the Gypsy Horse should display proper angulation for a pulling horse,{{r|gypsyhorses1}} although not to the degree found in larger feathered draught breeds such as the modern [[Shire horse|Shire]] and [[Clydesdale horse|Clydesdale]].{{r|vanners1|gypsyhorses1|gypsyhorseassociation2}} Unlike the [[equine conformation]]al flaw of [[cow-hocked]]ness,{{r|gypsyhorseassociation2}} where only the lower leg is turned outward, a Gypsy Horse's entire hind leg  is set so as to angle outward. As a result, when the hind legs of a horse set up squarely are viewed from the rear, their cannon bones appear parallel.{{r|gypsyhorses1|vanners1}}\n\nThe Gypsy horse has distinct [[horse gait|gaits]]. According to GHA's standard, \"The stride should be correct, supple, and powerful. Showing good impulsion from behind, demonstrating powerful drive. Flowing, effortless in appearance\".{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1}} The horse's movement should be \"natural, not artificial . . . . Some have higher knee action than others, it's[sic] way of going can vary from short and economical to longer, reaching strides.\"{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1}}  GHRA's standard requires \"[a] steady forward walk with impulsion. Ground covering [[trot (horse gait)|trot]] with a slight flick of feather at the point of extension.\"{{r|ghra1}}\n\nThe Gypsy horse should be a \"strong, kind, (very) intelligent partner that works willingly and harmoniously with its handler. They are also described as mannerly and manageable, eager to please, confident, courageous, alert, and loyal with a genuine sociable outlook. The Gypsy Horse is renowned for its gentle, tractable nature and sensible disposition.\"{{r|gha2}}\n\nThe Gypsy Horse is prone to diseases common to feathered draught horses. The most serious of these is [[chronic progressive lymphedema]].{{r|vetmed}}  This condition may have a genetic component, as is a [[Lymphedema\u2013distichiasis syndrome|similar condition]] in humans. However, studies to date have not identified a causative gene.{{r|vetmed2}}  Of less concern is [[mud fever|pastern dermatitis]] (\"greasy heels\").  The moist environment under the feathering is an ideal environment for the combination of fungus and mites which are believed to cause it.\n\n== History==\n[[File:Gypsy caravan.jpg|thumb|Historic image of a traveller family, vardo, and horse]]\nThe Gypsy Horse was bred by the [[Romanichal|Romanichal Travellers]] of Great Britain to [[driving (horse)|pull]] the [[Vardo (Romani wagon)|Vardoes]] in which they lived and travelled.{{r|hart|page=62}} Romanichal Travellers had arrived in the British Isles by 1500 AD, but they did not begin to live in vardoes until around 1850.{{r|ward|page=22}} Prior to that, they travelled in tilted carts or afoot and slept either under or in these carts or in small tents.{{r|ward|page=29}} The peak usage of the Gypsy caravan occurred in the latter part of the 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th.{{r|ward|page=51}}\n\nSome aspects of training, management, and characteristics of a horse used to pull a [[Vardo (Romani wagon)|Vardo]] are unique. For example, the horse is trained not to stop until it reaches the top of a hill; otherwise it may not be able to get started again. Training begins at a very early age with the young horse tied \"with a short rope from the head to the trace-ring on the collar of the shaft-horse\", and led along on the off side.{{r|ward|page=59}} An old hat is sometimes placed on a fearful horse's head so as to keep him from seeing back over the top of his blinkers at the wagon looming at his back. A horse used to pull a vardo which was a permanent home was usually in very good condition due to a combination of exercise, grazing a variety of greens in the [[hedgerow]]s, and good quality care; the horse was considered part of the family.{{r|ward|page=61}} Since the family's children lived in close proximity to the horse, one having \"an unreliable temper could not be tolerated\".{{r|hart|page=63}}\n\nThe Gypsy Horse was also used to pull the \"tradesman's cart . . . used in conjunction with the caravan as a runabout and work vehicle and whilst on a journey\".{{r|jones|page=23}} This is also known as a [[drayman|flatbed]] or a [[Trolley (horse-drawn)|trolley]], and examples appear in the annual London Harness Horse Parade.{{r|lhhp}}\n[[File:Gypsy wagon near Broadwell - geograph.org.uk - 1528537.jpg|thumb|Horse and bow-top wagon near [[Broadwell, Warwickshire]]]]\n\nThe Gypsy Horse breed as it is today is thought to have begun to take shape shortly after the Second World War.{{r|hart|page=63|GVHShistory}}  When the British Roma had first begun to live in vardoes around 1850, they used mules and cast off horses of any suitable breed to pull them.{{r|hart|page=62}} These later included coloured horses which had become unfashionable in mainstream society and were typically culled.{{r|hart|page=62\u201363}} Among these were a significant number of coloured [[Shire horse]]s.{{r|hart|page=43}} Many of these ended up with Romanichal breeders, and by the 1950s, they were considered valuable status symbols within that culture.{{r|hart|page=63}} [[leopard complex|Spotted]] horses were very briefly in fashion around the time of the Second World War, but quickly went out of fashion in favour of the coloured horse, which has retained its popularity until the present day.{{r|hart|page=58}} The initial greater height of the breed derived from the influence of both [[Clydesdale horse|Clydesdales]] and Shires.{{r|hart|page=63}}\n\nIn the formative years of the Gypsy Horse, the Romanichal bred not only for specific colour, profuse feather, and greater bone, but also for increased action and smaller size. To increase action at the [[Trot (horse gait)|trot]], they first tried [[Hackney pony|Hackney Pony]] breeding, but this blood reduced both feather and bone. The Roma therefore turned to the [[Welsh Pony and Cob|Section D Welsh Cob]] to add a more animated trot to the breed without loss of other desired traits. Another trend in breeding was a steady decrease in height, a trend still present among many Romani breeders. In the 1990s, the breed's average height still was in excess of {{hands|15|}}, but horses of {{hands|14.3|to|15}} were beginning to be viewed as more desirable, primarily for economic reasons. John Shaw, a carriage painter from Milnrow, Rochdale, Lancaster, was quoted in 1993 as saying, \"Very big, hairy coloureds are now in vogue. They are status symbols . . . but they are not really an economical animal. They cost too much to feed, harness and shoe. . . and they don't stand up to the work. For that you want the vanner type of {{hands|14.3|to|15}}\"; larger horses require more [[fodder]] than smaller ones, as well as larger [[horse harness|harnesses]] and [[horseshoe]]s.{{r|hart|page=64}}\n\nThe breed most used by the Romani breeders to set not only the size but also the type of the future Gypsy Horse was the [[Dales pony|Dales Pony]], described as \"thick, strong, . . . active yet a great puller\".{{r|hart|page=63}} The Dales, a draught [[pony]], preserved the bone, feather, and pulling capabilities derived from the Shire and Clydesdale breeds but in a smaller and therefore more economical package. The Dales and, to a lesser extent, the [[Fell pony|Fell Pony]] interbred with the Shire and Clydesdale provided the basis of today's Gypsy Horse.{{r|GVHShistory}}\n\nSince the Romani people who developed the Gypsy Horse{{r|lynghaug|page=387}} communicated [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]] and breed information orally,{{r|hart|page=58}} information on [[foundation bloodstock]] and significant horses within the breed is mostly anecdotal. The two [[foundation bloodstock|foundation sires]] of the breed are reportedly known as The Old Coal Horse and Sonny Mays' Horse.{{r|GVHShistory}} It is said that The Coal Horse goes back to a [[gray (horse)|grey]] Shire [[stallion]] known as Shaw's Grey Horse of Scotland. The origins of the breed appear to be Irish, and the name Connors appears prominently in the breed history. In a poorly recorded interview, well-respected breeder Henry Connors gives some of the lineage of the horse.{{r|youtube}} It includes horses with names such as Ben's of Bonafay, Jimmy Doyle's Horse of Ballymartin, Henry Connors' White Horse, The Lob Eared Horse, The Sham Horse, and Old Henry.\n\nThe Irish cob can be traced to the 18th century but also was long considered a type, not a breed, and varied somewhat in characteristics, though generally was bred for light draught and farm work but was also capable of being ridden.  It originated from crossing [[Thoroughbred]], [[Connemara pony]] and [[Irish Draught]] horses.{{r|hendricks|page=234}}\n[[File:He's a big foal - geograph.org.uk - 1494305.jpg|thumb|Mare and foal near [[Builth Wells]], [[Powys]], Wales]]\n[[File:Irish Tinker horse 2.JPG|thumb|At a horse show in [[Prague]], in the Czech Republic]]\n\nBeginning in 1996, breed associations and societies were formed in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Among these are the Gypsy Vanner Horse Society (1996), the Irish Cob Society (1998), the Gypsy Cob and Drum Horse Association (2002), the Gypsy Cob Society of America, later the Gypsy Horse Registry of America (2003), the Australasian Gypsy Horse Society (2007), and the NZ Gypsy Cob Association (2012).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe first known Gypsy Horses to come to America arrived in 1996, imported by Dennis and Cindy Thompson, who created the Gypsy Vanner name and started a breed society.{{r|Byrnes}}\n===Names===\n\nThe breed was traditionally known as the Irish Cob. It was often referred to simply as a \"Cob\", although the term [[Cob (horse)|cob]] defines a short-legged, stout type of horse rather than a breed. Other names are used worldwide for the breed, such as Gypsy Cob, Gypsy Vanner and Tinker Cob, alluding to its association with the [[Irish Travellers|travelling community]].{{r|hsistudbook}}\n\n[[File:Caravans at Appleby Horse Fair - geograph.org.uk - 461639.jpg|thumb|Caravans at Appleby Horse Fair]]\n\nThe first known importers of the Gypsy Horse to [[North America]], Dennis and Cindy Thompson, viewed the breed as unnamed and chose the name \"vanner\",{{r|vanners}} calling their association the Gypsy Vanner Horse Society.{{r|GVHShistory}}  A \"vanner\"  is a light draught horse suitable for pulling a [[horse-drawn van]] or [[Horsebus|omnibus]]; the term dates to at least 1888.{{r|oed|hayes|page2=125}}  Before the formation of the American society in 1996, the word \"vanner\" appears in two printed sources in association with these horses. In 1979, Harvey described a Roma-owned horse as \"[a] fair-sized vanner, about 15.2hh (15 1/2 hands) high, . . . [c]ross-shire, with a touch of Clydesdale? Lineage is often hard to trace.\"{{r|harvey|page=56}} Publishing in 1993 in the first known acknowledgment of the Gypsy Horse as a distinct breed outside Romani culture, Hart employs the term three times in reference to a Gypsy Horse, identifying specific Gypsy Horses as vanners.{{r|hart|page=59, 64, 126}}\n\nFounded subsequently in 1998, 2002, and 2003, respectively, the Irish Cob Society,{{r|ics1}} the Gypsy Cob and Drum Horse Association,{{r|gcdha}} and the Gypsy Cob Society of America{{r|GCSA}} referred to the breed as \"Cob\", the name used by its Romani breeders. The Gypsy Horse Association, incorporated in 2008, employed the name \"Gypsy Horse\" and states on its website that the organisation recognizes all breed names currently in use.{{r|gypsyhorseassociation3}} Also in 2008, the GCSA renamed itself the Gypsy Horse Registry of America.{{r|ghra2}}\n\nBreed associations in Belgium, Sweden and the Netherlands are listed in the [[Universal Equine Life Number]] database under the breed names \"Tinker Horse\" and \"Tinker Pony.\"{{r|ueln}}\n\n== Registration ==\n[[File:Rumnichal Horse Fair.jpg|thumb|Horse-trading in The Sands in [[Appleby-in-Westmorland]]]]\n\nAmong the assorted associations and societies dedicated to the breed, there is some variety in services offered. The Gypsy Horse Registry of America includes size classifications in its stud book.{{r|ghra3}} The Gypsy Horse Association provides access to the identifying DNA markers, pedigrees (both anecdotal and DNA verified), and registration photos of most of its registered horses online and free of charge.{{r|GHARegistration}} The Gypsy Horse Association{{r|GHARegistration}}  and the Gypsy Horse Registry of America{{r|ghra4}} provide online stud-books. The Gypsy Vanner Horse Society provides access to its stud-book for a fee.{{r|GVHSStudbook}} The GVHS also has inspections for registered horses and provides awards for year end points from approved shows. The Gypsy Cob and Drum Horse Association offers inspections{{r|gcdha2}} and some shows.{{r|gcdha3}}\n\nSince registration for the Gypsy Horse has only existed within the last 20 years, most associations require a [[genetic analysis]] for registration, to verify identity and identify future offspring. All of the North American Gypsy Horse and Drum Horse societies employ the Animal Genetics Research Laboratory of the [[University of Kentucky]] to perform [[DNA]] analysis and maintain a database of registered horses' DNA markers.{{r|GHA-DNA}} UKY currently tests markers at 17 [[locus (genetics)|loci]] of a horse's genetic makeup. The aim of this analysis is to either exclude or fail to exclude another horse as a parent.{{r|ca.uky|gha5}} In a spirit of co-operation, the five American breed societies have jointly granted the University of Kentucky permission to employ their registered horses' DNA markers in confirming parentage of horses belonging to other registries. Since information regarding the past histories, including parentage, of many of the Gypsy Horses imported to North America was lost, many owners seek to reclaim the genetic roots of their animals, and services have sprung up to satisfy this desire.{{r|gh|gvhs2}}\n\nBecause many of the horses submitted for registration have never been registered, the American organisations evaluate horses for registration by way of photos and provenance information such as import papers and bills of sale.{{r|gharegistration|gvhsregistration|GHRARegistration|dha}}\n\nBeginning in 2014, GVHS began restricting registration to horses sired by GVHS-registered stallions and out of mares whose DNA markers are available and confirm parentage. Only horses falling between {{hands|13|and|16}} in height are eligible for registration, although the status of animals whose heights fall outside that range can be appealed to GVHS's board of directors.{{r|gvhsregistration}}\n\nThe Netherlands stud book only allows full registration to offspring of horses previously registered with the NSvT; horses identified as Irish Cob, Gypsy Cob, Gypsy Vanner, Coloured Horse, Traveller Pony, Black and White, or Traditional Cob may be evaluated as potential breeding stock and, if suitable, recorded in a secondary register, with their offspring eligible for full registration. Horses must pass an inspection to be registered.{{r|NSVT}} The Irish Cob Society also requires an [[studbook selection|inspection process]].{{r|ics1}}  The Gypsy Cob Register of the UK & Ireland, a registry run by the Travelling Community, has a DNA database and requires breeding stallions to have a DNA profile.{{r|GCregister}}\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Gyspy vanner free style.jpg|thumb|Under [[western riding|western]] saddle]]\n\nGypsy Cobs are shown and traded at traditional horse fairs, of which the [[Appleby Horse Fair]] is the largest in Europe. Many Travellers and Romani travel to the fair in traditional horse-drawn caravans and [[Vardo (Romani wagon)|vardos]].{{r|appleby}} American photographer John S. Hockensmith documented such a journey in 2004, travelling with and photographing the Harker family's {{convert|60|mi|adj=on}} journey to Appleby in bow-top living wagons.{{r|hock|page=12}} Capstick and Donogue also published photographs taken at Appleby Fair, some vintage,{{r|capstick}} and Jones published photos taken at Yorkshire horse fairs, some from the early 1900s.{{r|jones}}\n\nIn North America, the first known show classes dedicated to the Gypsy Horse were held at the Colorado Horse Park on 28\u201329 August 2004, during its annual draught horse show, employing the breed standard of the Gypsy Cob Society of America, now the Gypsy Horse Registry of America.{{r|gh2}} The first Gypsy [[horse show|breed show]], the [[Ohio State Fair]] Gypsy Vanner Horse Show, sponsored by the Gypsy Vanner Horse Society, was held in 2005 in Columbus, Ohio. Currently there are a number of breed shows for the Gypsy Horse in the US and Canada.{{r|gha6}}\n[[File:Tinker Einsp\u00e4nner 1.jpg|thumb|In harness]]\n\nIn the United States, the Gypsy Horse is used in many equestrian sports, by amateurs and youths.{{r|graybeal}} In 2004, the [[United States Dressage Federation]] accepted the Gypsy Vanner Horse Society as an affiliate member,{{r|usdf2}} allowing horses registered with GVHS to compete in its [[dressage]] and dressage-related events.{{r|GVHShistory}} The Gypsy Horse Association was accepted into the USDF programme in 2008; two other coloured horse associations had joined by 2011.{{r|usdf}}\n\n== In creative works ==\nIn the Netflix series \"[[Free Rein]]\", \"Bob\", a black and white Pinto Gypsy horse, is owned by Rebecca \"Becky\" Sidebottom and her brother Ben.

There was no [[stud-book]] or [[breed association]] for horses of this type until 1996.{{r|hart|page=58}} It is now considered a breed{{r|hart|page=58}} and can be registered by the [https://www.tgca.co.uk/ Traditional Gypsy Cob Association (TGCA)].{{efn|This includes breed organisations in Ireland,{{r|ICS}} the Netherlands,{{r|nsvt}} Germany,{{r|cob.de}} Denmark{{r|dansk}} Sweden{{r|svensk}} Czech Republic,{{r|cob.cz}} New Zealand,{{r|nzgca}} four in the USA \u2013 the Gypsy Cob Society of America, the Gypsy Horse Association, the Gypsy Horse Registry of America, and the Gypsy Vanner Horse Society \u2013 and two in Australia \u2013 the Gypsy Horse Australasian Society and the Western Australian Gypsy Horse Society}}.\n\nFrom about 1850 travelling people in the British Isles began to use a distinct type of horse to [[driving (horse)|pull]] their [[Vardo (Romani wagon)|vardo]]s, the caravans in which they had just begun to live and travel. The colour and look of the breed were refined in the years after the [[Second World War]]. Horses of this type were first exported to the United States in 1996.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nOne November 24, 1996 the worlds first registry for a breed of horse developed by British Gypsies was founded, it is The Gypsy Vanner Horse Society. The Gypsy Vanner Horse is often, but not always, [[piebald/black and white ]].{{r|johnson|page=314}} It may also be [[skewbald]brown or red and white ] or solid colors. [[equine coat color|colour]]; a solid-coloured horse with [[splashed white|white splashing]] on the underbelly is called \"blagdon\" or if splashed all over it is called Splash blagdon \".{{r|ics1}} There is no coat colour requirement in the [[breed standard]] of the Irish Cob Society,{{r|ics1}} Gypsy Cob Register,{{r|GCregister}} Gypsy Vanner Horse Society,{{r|vanners1}} Gypsy Horse Registry of [[United States|America]], {{r|ghra1}} or Australasian Gypsy Horse Society.{{r|aghs1}} Since the horse originates in the British Isles, British colour names may be used in registration in the [[United States]].{{r|vanners1|gypsyhorseassociation1}} \n[[File:Feather on Horse's Lower Leg.jpg|thumb|Feather on the lower legs]]\n[[File:Solid chestnut coloured Gypsy Cob Horse 1.jpg|thumb|upright|A solid-coloured cob]]\n[[File:GypsyHockSet.jpg|thumb|upright|Hocks of a foal]]\n\nThere are many [[breed registry|breed societies]] for horses raised by Gypsies, with variations in their respective breed standards. The range of desired heights is generally from {{hands|13|to|16}} in the [[United States]] and Australasia,{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1|aghs1}} but in Ireland and continental Europe, the desired height limit goes up to {{hands|16.2}} for some types and they permit both lighter-boned as well as larger horses than typically desired by the American organisations.{{r|ics1|NSVT}}{{efn|name= b}}  Some stud-books have different categories:  The Gypsy Horse Registry of America has two height classifications: Section A for purebred horses under {{hands|14.2}} and Section B for purebred horses {{hands|14.2}} and over. Its Section C is for Gypsy Crossbred horses.{{r|GHRA}}  The Netherlands stud-book for Gypsy horses, the Nederlands Stamboek voor Tinkers, identified there as the \"Tinker horse,\" classifies horses into three groups: \"cob,\" \"vanner,\" and \"grai,\" based on height in metres and degree of refinement. The cob type is approximately {{hands|14.3|to|15.1}}, and the vanner {{hands|15.1|to|16.2}}. The more refined \"grai\" may be of any size but is typically within the 14.3- to 16.2-hand range.{{r|NSVT}}\n\n[[Feathering (horse)|Feathering]], long hair on the legs, is considered a \"characteristic and decorative feature of the Irish Cob\", but is not a requirement for registration.{{r|ics1}}\n\nA Gypsy Horse's facial profile should be straight, neither overly dished nor roman nosed.  A \"sweet\" head, more refined than that of most draught horses, is desired.{{r|lynghaug|page=393-394}} The GHA's breed standard states that the head ''may'' be \"sweet\", \"a small, tidy pony type head\",{{r|gypsyhorses1}} meaning without coarseness and in proportion with the body,{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1}} but the AGHS calls unequivocally for a sweet head, \"more refined than a Shire might have . . . with broad forehead, generous jaw, square muzzle, and even bite\".{{r|aghs1}} According to GVHS, the \"forehead must be flat and broad . . . with [t]he frontal facial bone . . . flat to slightly convex\".{{r|vanners1}}\n\nThe neck is strong, muscular, and of medium length \"with a throat latch slightly deeper than lighter breeds\".{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1|nzgca1}} The chest should be broad, deep, and well muscled.{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1|aghs1|ghra1}}  [[Withers]] are \"well rounded, not high and fine, i.e., hardly noticeable\".{{r|aghs1}} Most standards call for a \"well-sloped\" shoulder {{r|gypsyhorseassociation1|aghs1|nzgca1}} But the GVHS's standard is more precise, specifying a shoulder angle ranging from 45 degrees to 60 degrees.{{r|vanners1}}  The [[back (horse)|back]] is to be short [[Back (horse)|coupled]] with well sprung ribs and a deep heart girth.{{r|aghs1|ghra1}}   The length of line of the belly should be twice that of the topline of the back and the horse should not appear 'wasp waisted'.{{r|gypsyhorses1}} The Dutch breed standard for vanner and cob types requires a strong, well-muscled build with abundant feathering, similar to that of other associations. The \"grai\" is classified as a lighter and more refined riding type.{{r|NSVT}}\n\nStrong hindquarters define the breed as a small draught horse, \"designed for strength and power, but with class, presence and style.\"{{r|vanners1}} They are sometimes described as having an \"apple butt\"{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1|gypsyhorses1}} as the [[rump (animal)|croup]] is well rounded and \"very generous, smooth and broad\".{{r|ghra1}} Poorly-muscled hindquarters or a too-sloping rump are unacceptable.{{r|aghs1}} The line measuring the length of the hip should also be horizontal; if the tailhead falls below the horizontal line intersecting the point of the hip, the horse's \"hip/croup will be approaching too steep an angle for the Gypsy Vanner\".{{r|vanners1}}\n\nBone in the [[limbs of the horse|legs]] should be heavy, clean, and flat.{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1|aghs1|ghra1|gypsyhorses1|nzgca1}} GVHS's standard calls for a length of forearm to cannon ratio of 55% to 45%.{{r|vanners1}} The front legs should be clean and flat in joints as well as bone; front [[pastern]]s should slope at the same angle as the shoulder and should not be short.{{r|gypsyhorses1}} A line drawn from the point of the buttock should touch the back of the hock, run  \"parallel\" to the cannon bone, and touch the  ground directly behind \"the center of the heel\".{{r|vanners1|gypsyhorses1}}  Pastern and hoof angles of the hindlegs are more vertical than the forelegs, usually over 50 degrees.{{r|vanners1}} [[Horse hoof|Hooves]] have strong walls and a well shaped [[frog (horse)|frog]],{{r|ghra1}} round and with wide heels.{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1}}\n\nThe hind legs of the Gypsy Horse should display proper angulation for a pulling horse,{{r|gypsyhorses1}} although not to the degree found in larger feathered draught breeds such as the modern [[Shire horse|Shire]] and [[Clydesdale horse|Clydesdale]].{{r|vanners1|gypsyhorses1|gypsyhorseassociation2}} Unlike the [[equine conformation]]al flaw of [[cow-hocked]]ness,{{r|gypsyhorseassociation2}} where only the lower leg is turned outward, a Gypsy Horse's entire hind leg  is set so as to angle outward. As a result, when the hind legs of a horse set up squarely are viewed from the rear, their cannon bones appear parallel.{{r|gypsyhorses1|vanners1}}\n\nThe Gypsy horse has distinct [[horse gait|gaits]]. According to GHA's standard, \"The stride should be correct, supple, and powerful. Showing good impulsion from behind, demonstrating powerful drive. Flowing, effortless in appearance\".{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1}} The horse's movement should be \"natural, not artificial . . . . Some have higher knee action than others, it's[sic] way of going can vary from short and economical to longer, reaching strides.\"{{r|gypsyhorseassociation1}}  GHRA's standard requires \"[a] steady forward walk with impulsion. Ground covering [[trot (horse gait)|trot]] with a slight flick of feather at the point of extension.\"{{r|ghra1}}\n\nThe Gypsy horse should be a \"strong, kind, (very) intelligent partner that works willingly and harmoniously with its handler. They are also described as mannerly and manageable, eager to please, confident, courageous, alert, and loyal with a genuine sociable outlook. The Gypsy Horse is renowned for its gentle, tractable nature and sensible disposition.\"{{r|gha2}}\n\nThe Gypsy Horse is prone to diseases common to feathered draught horses. The most serious of these is [[chronic progressive lymphedema]].{{r|vetmed}}  This condition may have a genetic component, as is a [[Lymphedema\u2013distichiasis syndrome|similar condition]] in humans. However, studies to date have not identified a causative gene.{{r|vetmed2}}  Of less concern is [[mud fever|pastern dermatitis]] (\"greasy heels\").  The moist environment under the feathering is an ideal environment for the combination of fungus and mites which are believed to cause it.\n\n== History==\n[[File:Gypsy caravan.jpg|thumb|Historic image of a traveller family, vardo, and horse]]\nThe Gypsy Horse was bred by the [[Romanichal|Romanichal Travellers]] of Great Britain to [[driving (horse)|pull]] the [[Vardo (Romani wagon)|Vardoes]] in which they lived and travelled.{{r|hart|page=62}} Romanichal Travellers had arrived in the British Isles by 1500 AD, but they did not begin to live in vardoes until around 1850.{{r|ward|page=22}} Prior to that, they travelled in tilted carts or afoot and slept either under or in these carts or in small tents.{{r|ward|page=29}} The peak usage of the Gypsy caravan occurred in the latter part of the 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th.{{r|ward|page=51}}\n\nSome aspects of training, management, and characteristics of a horse used to pull a [[Vardo (Romani wagon)|Vardo]] are unique. For example, the horse is trained not to stop until it reaches the top of a hill; otherwise it may not be able to get started again. Training begins at a very early age with the young horse tied \"with a short rope from the head to the trace-ring on the collar of the shaft-horse\", and led along on the off side.{{r|ward|page=59}} An old hat is sometimes placed on a fearful horse's head so as to keep him from seeing back over the top of his blinkers at the wagon looming at his back. A horse used to pull a vardo which was a permanent home was usually in very good condition due to a combination of exercise, grazing a variety of greens in the [[hedgerow]]s, and good quality care; the horse was considered part of the family.{{r|ward|page=61}} Since the family's children lived in close proximity to the horse, one having \"an unreliable temper could not be tolerated\".{{r|hart|page=63}}\n\nThe Gypsy Horse was also used to pull the \"tradesman's cart . . . used in conjunction with the caravan as a runabout and work vehicle and whilst on a journey\".{{r|jones|page=23}} This is also known as a [[drayman|flatbed]] or a [[Trolley (horse-drawn)|trolley]], and examples appear in the annual London Harness Horse Parade.{{r|lhhp}}\n[[File:Gypsy wagon near Broadwell - geograph.org.uk - 1528537.jpg|thumb|Horse and bow-top wagon near [[Broadwell, Warwickshire]]]]\n\nThe Gypsy Horse breed as it is today is thought to have begun to take shape shortly after the Second World War.{{r|hart|page=63|GVHShistory}}  When the British Roma had first begun to live in vardoes around 1850, they used mules and cast off horses of any suitable breed to pull them.{{r|hart|page=62}} These later included coloured horses which had become unfashionable in mainstream society and were typically culled.{{r|hart|page=62\u201363}} Among these were a significant number of coloured [[Shire horse]]s.{{r|hart|page=43}} Many of these ended up with Romanichal breeders, and by the 1950s, they were considered valuable status symbols within that culture.{{r|hart|page=63}} [[leopard complex|Spotted]] horses were very briefly in fashion around the time of the Second World War, but quickly went out of fashion in favour of the coloured horse, which has retained its popularity until the present day.{{r|hart|page=58}} The initial greater height of the breed derived from the influence of both [[Clydesdale horse|Clydesdales]] and Shires.{{r|hart|page=63}}\n\nIn the formative years of the Gypsy Horse, the Romanichal bred not only for specific colour, profuse feather, and greater bone, but also for increased action and smaller size. To increase action at the [[Trot (horse gait)|trot]], they first tried [[Hackney pony|Hackney Pony]] breeding, but this blood reduced both feather and bone. The Roma therefore turned to the [[Welsh Pony and Cob|Section D Welsh Cob]] to add a more animated trot to the breed without loss of other desired traits. Another trend in breeding was a steady decrease in height, a trend still present among many Romani breeders. In the 1990s, the breed's average height still was in excess of {{hands|15|}}, but horses of {{hands|14.3|to|15}} were beginning to be viewed as more desirable, primarily for economic reasons. John Shaw, a carriage painter from Milnrow, Rochdale, Lancaster, was quoted in 1993 as saying, \"Very big, hairy coloureds are now in vogue. They are status symbols . . . but they are not really an economical animal. They cost too much to feed, harness and shoe. . . and they don't stand up to the work. For that you want the vanner type of {{hands|14.3|to|15}}\"; larger horses require more [[fodder]] than smaller ones, as well as larger [[horse harness|harnesses]] and [[horseshoe]]s.{{r|hart|page=64}}\n\nThe breed most used by the Romani breeders to set not only the size but also the type of the future Gypsy Horse was the [[Dales pony|Dales Pony]], described as \"thick, strong, . . . active yet a great puller\".{{r|hart|page=63}} The Dales, a draught [[pony]], preserved the bone, feather, and pulling capabilities derived from the Shire and Clydesdale breeds but in a smaller and therefore more economical package. The Dales and, to a lesser extent, the [[Fell pony|Fell Pony]] interbred with the Shire and Clydesdale provided the basis of today's Gypsy Horse.{{r|GVHShistory}}\n\nSince the Romani people who developed the Gypsy Horse{{r|lynghaug|page=387}} communicated [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]] and breed information orally,{{r|hart|page=58}} information on [[foundation bloodstock]] and significant horses within the breed is mostly anecdotal. The two [[foundation bloodstock|foundation sires]] of the breed are reportedly known as The Old Coal Horse and Sonny Mays' Horse.{{r|GVHShistory}} It is said that The Coal Horse goes back to a [[gray (horse)|grey]] Shire [[stallion]] known as Shaw's Grey Horse of Scotland. The origins of the breed appear to be Irish, and the name Connors appears prominently in the breed history. In a poorly recorded interview, well-respected breeder Henry Connors gives some of the lineage of the horse.{{r|youtube}} It includes horses with names such as Ben's of Bonafay, Jimmy Doyle's Horse of Ballymartin, Henry Connors' White Horse, The Lob Eared Horse, The Sham Horse, and Old Henry.\n\nThe Irish cob can be traced to the 18th century but also was long considered a type, not a breed, and varied somewhat in characteristics, though generally was bred for light draught and farm work but was also capable of being ridden.  It originated from crossing [[Thoroughbred]], [[Connemara pony]] and [[Irish Draught]] horses.{{r|hendricks|page=234}}\n[[File:He's a big foal - geograph.org.uk - 1494305.jpg|thumb|Mare and foal near [[Builth Wells]], [[Powys]], Wales]]\n[[File:Irish Tinker horse 2.JPG|thumb|At a horse show in [[Prague]], in the Czech Republic]]\n\nBeginning in 1996, breed associations and societies were formed in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Among these are the Gypsy Vanner Horse Society (1996), the Irish Cob Society (1998), the Gypsy Cob and Drum Horse Association (2002), the Gypsy Cob Society of America, later the Gypsy Horse Registry of America (2003), the Australasian Gypsy Horse Society (2007), and the NZ Gypsy Cob Association (2012).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe first known Gypsy Horses to come to America arrived in 1996, imported by Dennis and Cindy Thompson, who created the Gypsy Vanner name and started a breed society.{{r|Byrnes}}\n===Names===\n\nThe breed was traditionally known as the Irish Cob. It was often referred to simply as a \"Cob\", although the term [[Cob (horse)|cob]] defines a short-legged, stout type of horse rather than a breed. Other names are used worldwide for the breed, such as Gypsy Cob, Gypsy Vanner and Tinker Cob, alluding to its association with the [[Irish Travellers|travelling community]].{{r|hsistudbook}}\n\n[[File:Caravans at Appleby Horse Fair - geograph.org.uk - 461639.jpg|thumb|Caravans at Appleby Horse Fair]]\n\nThe first known importers of the Gypsy Horse to [[North America]], Dennis and Cindy Thompson, viewed the breed as unnamed and chose the name \"vanner\",{{r|vanners}} calling their association the Gypsy Vanner Horse Society.{{r|GVHShistory}}  A \"vanner\"  is a light draught horse suitable for pulling a [[horse-drawn van]] or [[Horsebus|omnibus]]; the term dates to at least 1888.{{r|oed|hayes|page2=125}}  Before the formation of the American society in 1996, the word \"vanner\" appears in two printed sources in association with these horses. In 1979, Harvey described a Roma-owned horse as \"[a] fair-sized vanner, about 15.2hh (15 1/2 hands) high, . . . [c]ross-shire, with a touch of Clydesdale? Lineage is often hard to trace.\"{{r|harvey|page=56}} Publishing in 1993 in the first known acknowledgment of the Gypsy Horse as a distinct breed outside Romani culture, Hart employs the term three times in reference to a Gypsy Horse, identifying specific Gypsy Horses as vanners.{{r|hart|page=59, 64, 126}}\n\nFounded subsequently in 1998, 2002, and 2003, respectively, the Irish Cob Society,{{r|ics1}} the Gypsy Cob and Drum Horse Association,{{r|gcdha}} and the Gypsy Cob Society of America{{r|GCSA}} referred to the breed as \"Cob\", the name used by its Romani breeders. The Gypsy Horse Association, incorporated in 2008, employed the name \"Gypsy Horse\" and states on its website that the organisation recognizes all breed names currently in use.{{r|gypsyhorseassociation3}} Also in 2008, the GCSA renamed itself the Gypsy Horse Registry of America.{{r|ghra2}}\n\nBreed associations in Belgium, Sweden and the Netherlands are listed in the [[Universal Equine Life Number]] database under the breed names \"Tinker Horse\" and \"Tinker Pony.\"{{r|ueln}}\n\n== Registration ==\n[[File:Rumnichal Horse Fair.jpg|thumb|Horse-trading in The Sands in [[Appleby-in-Westmorland]]]]\n\nAmong the assorted associations and societies dedicated to the breed, there is some variety in services offered. The Gypsy Horse Registry of America includes size classifications in its stud book.{{r|ghra3}} The Gypsy Horse Association provides access to the identifying DNA markers, pedigrees (both anecdotal and DNA verified), and registration photos of most of its registered horses online and free of charge.{{r|GHARegistration}} The Gypsy Horse Association{{r|GHARegistration}}  and the Gypsy Horse Registry of America{{r|ghra4}} provide online stud-books. The Gypsy Vanner Horse Society provides access to its stud-book for a fee.{{r|GVHSStudbook}} The GVHS also has inspections for registered horses and provides awards for year end points from approved shows. The Gypsy Cob and Drum Horse Association offers inspections{{r|gcdha2}} and some shows.{{r|gcdha3}}\n\nSince registration for the Gypsy Horse has only existed within the last 20 years, most associations require a [[genetic analysis]] for registration, to verify identity and identify future offspring. All of the North American Gypsy Horse and Drum Horse societies employ the Animal Genetics Research Laboratory of the [[University of Kentucky]] to perform [[DNA]] analysis and maintain a database of registered horses' DNA markers.{{r|GHA-DNA}} UKY currently tests markers at 17 [[locus (genetics)|loci]] of a horse's genetic makeup. The aim of this analysis is to either exclude or fail to exclude another horse as a parent.{{r|ca.uky|gha5}} In a spirit of co-operation, the five American breed societies have jointly granted the University of Kentucky permission to employ their registered horses' DNA markers in confirming parentage of horses belonging to other registries. Since information regarding the past histories, including parentage, of many of the Gypsy Horses imported to North America was lost, many owners seek to reclaim the genetic roots of their animals, and services have sprung up to satisfy this desire.{{r|gh|gvhs2}}\n\nBecause many of the horses submitted for registration have never been registered, the American organisations evaluate horses for registration by way of photos and provenance information such as import papers and bills of sale.{{r|gharegistration|gvhsregistration|GHRARegistration|dha}}\n\nBeginning in 2014, GVHS began restricting registration to horses sired by GVHS-registered stallions and out of mares whose DNA markers are available and confirm parentage. Only horses falling between {{hands|13|and|16}} in height are eligible for registration, although the status of animals whose heights fall outside that range can be appealed to GVHS's board of directors.{{r|gvhsregistration}}\n\nThe Netherlands stud book only allows full registration to offspring of horses previously registered with the NSvT; horses identified as Irish Cob, Gypsy Cob, Gypsy Vanner, Coloured Horse, Traveller Pony, Black and White, or Traditional Cob may be evaluated as potential breeding stock and, if suitable, recorded in a secondary register, with their offspring eligible for full registration. Horses must pass an inspection to be registered.{{r|NSVT}} The Irish Cob Society also requires an [[studbook selection|inspection process]].{{r|ics1}}  The Gypsy Cob Register of the UK & Ireland, a registry run by the Travelling Community, has a DNA database and requires breeding stallions to have a DNA profile.{{r|GCregister}}\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Gyspy vanner free style.jpg|thumb|Under [[western riding|western]] saddle]]\n\nGypsy Cobs are shown and traded at traditional horse fairs, of which the [[Appleby Horse Fair]] is the largest in Europe.
