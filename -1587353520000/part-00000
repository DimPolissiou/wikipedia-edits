It is a sequel to ''[[Darksiders II]]'' and the third entry in the ''[[Darksiders]]'' series.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Darksiders III'' is a great departure from the previous games, borrowing structure and gameplay elements from Metroidvania and [[FromSoftware]]'s [[Souls (series)|Souls]] series<ref name=\"windowscentral\" /> <ref name=\"IGNreview\" /> <ref name=\"gamespot\" />, the game is viewed as a weird mashup of elements of previous games and a new direction. Players take control of Fury, sister of War and Death, two of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], from a [[Third-person view|third-person]] perspective. Fury, a [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]] who is described as the most unpredictable and enigmatic of the Four Horsemen, relies on whips, swords, flails, daggers and magic in combat.<ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref name=\"THQ\" /> Fury can take on multiple different elemental forms in order to enhance her combat capabilities by granting her new weapons, attacks and traversal abilities.\n\nThe combat is described as more methodical <ref name=\"gamespot\" /> and straight forward<ref name=\"Eurogamerreview\" /> not focusing on large crowds of enemies like the previous games and removing the hit counter. Enemies are stronger than in previous installments but appear in smaller numbers during encounters, so as to make battles feel more personal. Some enemies from previous games return, while other foes are new. Gated combat is not a feature, in an attempt to make everything within the setting contextualized and interconnected like the Souls series<ref name=\"gamespot\" />.\n\n''Darksiders III'' focuses on its leveling system in which Fury's damage, health, and arcane damage <ref name=\"gamespot\" /> can be upgraded. The threats of the game's world will grow stronger as the player progresses through the story. Similar to War, yet dissimilar to Death, Fury collects souls from enemies and from objects in the environment, as a form of currency or an expendable resource. The player can attach \"Enhancement\"s to Fury's weapons for different perks and damage boosts.<ref name=\"pcgamerreview\" />\n\nThe game takes place in a continuous environment where exploration plays a large role in gathering more lurchers and materials to upgrade Fury herself and her arsenal. While exploring, Fury must solve simple puzzles<ref name=\"Eurogamerreview\" /> and overcome platforming obstacles, some of which make use of her whip. Such puzzles include using bombs to blow up obstructed pathways or Fury's Forms to interact with the environment.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{plot|date=January 2020}}Taking place parallel with ''[[Darksiders II]]'' and happening before the majority of ''[[Darksiders]]'', Fury, one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] is summoned by the Charred Council and tasked in finding the [[Seven Deadly Sins]]; one of the Watchers accompanies her on her quest.\n\nUpon arriving on a war-torn post-apocalyptic [[Earth]], Fury encounters the first of the sins, [[Envy]]. Upon Envy's defeat, Fury steals a talisman and uses it as a prison to hold Envy alongside the other sins she would encounter. Not long after, she finds her way to a tree named Haven where she encounters Ulthane (a previous character from ''Darksiders'') and some surviving humans of the apocalypse. Ulthane tasks Fury with sending any Humans she finds to Haven. She then leaves to find the next sin which is Wrath and Ulthane provides the location for him. Upon arriving to fight Wrath, he is engaged in fighting and killing angels. When she nearly kills Wrath, she summons her horse Rampage which gets killed by a mysterious, angelic weapon. Out of anger, Fury loses focus and Wrath stabs her while he taunts her. With her dying breath, she takes the blade in her gut and uses it to stab Wrath in the face but he does not die due to the fact that he was not imprisoned in the Talisman of sin. As Fury laid dying on the ground, a fiery portal takes her to the Lord of the Hollows. The Lord of the Hollows is a powerful entity within the Hollows that helps Fury in her quest to destroy the Seven Deadly Sins who wields the power that enables both weary Angels and Demons from the endless war, to a complete release from the cycle of life, death and rebirth of the Well of Souls. The Hollow Lord aids Fury but his own goals remain unknown. The Hollow Lord attempts to inform Fury that she is being manipulated by the Charred Council for their own scheme and call her ignorant and blind to their plans and lies. Though Fury denies it, the Lord of the Hollows nonetheless aids her by giving her the powers of elemental hollows (to enhance her combat abilities) and instructs her to hunt down the demon Abraxis and return to him with the demon's soul in tow.\n\nAs Fury takes on one sin after another, the Lord of Hollows continues to endow her with new hollows to aid in her mission. When she makes it to Abraxis' stronghold, Fury wants to know why the Lord of Hollows wants Abraxis dead. Abraxis tells Fury that a new dark lord is coming and he's only known as The Destroyer. The demon explains that the Lord of Hollows intends to hollow the mortal realm to install a new order. Since this is a choice in the story, if you choose to believe in Abraxis, the demon will thank and welcome you to his master's home anytime. Once you make it back to the Lord of Hollows, you'll still have the choice to face him in combat or choose to believe him. If you follow through for Abraxis, the Lord of Hollows will simply be killed. However, if you agree to believe the Lord of Hollows and face Abraxis, you'll kill him and take his soul as the prize. In which the former will reveal details of his own past and the council's corruption. Of how the Lord of Hollows was once a welcome delegate seated at their table, but he soon grew disillusioned with their obsessions and half-measures in enforcing the balance; only monitoring the first and second kingdoms while leaving the third to fend for itself. Culminating in pleading ignorance when in truth they let mankind be devastated by the premature apocalypse on their watch. Going onto explain his hollowing of souls and entrusting his will to Fury was his way of making amends for an eternity of inaction before ending his own life, all while leaving a new item behind for players to use in the future. \n\nAfter Fury defeats Pride, who is the final sin, she references the Hollow Lord while bringing up a stunning revelation in the aftermath of their battle. That the council have been secretly betraying the Balance behind everyone's backs from the start, she asks Fury who unleashed the Seven Deadly upon the Earth or how it was that they came to possess their new powers in order to do away with the rider. The Watcher that has been trailing Fury the whole time reveals herself to be the game's true final sin, the real Envy. Having tricked Fury and the Council to help herself power-up by absorbing the rest of the sins into her amulet, Envy reveals the truth in Pride's words after taking the talisman in order to wield the powers of those trapped within. With that revelation unveiled, Envy took advantage of the debilitated Fury. Using the Talisman of Sin to absorb the Horsemen's strength, weakening her while she was immobilized. \n\nThe sin goes on to say that the Council, which Fury and her brothers served loyally till now, had betrayed them from the beginning, having intended heading the Horsemen and the Sins into battle planning for both sides to destroy each other, resulting in mutually assured annihilation directed towards the council's own benefit. However, Envy boasted of knowing better, all while gloating that jealousy could smell jealousy, having assumed the identity of a trusted servant with the intent of taking advantage of anything and everything available to her; from the horsemen's egotism to the Council's trickery to obtain supreme power for herself. Ultimately, Envy intends to face the Charred Council directly with her enhanced powers for ownership of the Earth and Fury takes a steep fall, but she survives her predicament with help from Humans that she had rescued and turned over to the Makers care, Ulthane aids her by presenting a means he'd spent the whole story working on. Revealing he knew more than was letting on, the Blackhammer constructed a Reflecting Pool to get her to the council's domain and confront Envy as well as her former lords. Recognizing the odd parting gift Fury presented to him after having obtained it from the Hollow Lord, the former later refusing it on the notion he had no right to judge whom his fellow Old One had chosen to wield it. With new resolve, Fury defeats Envy and binds the sin within her own talisman, but the Charred Council no longer values Fury and wants to kill her along with her brothers. If the player has the mysterious stone sigil, Fury will use it to block the Charred Council's attack, the latter halting out of fear of its power. Although she doesn't know the identity of the stone, she realizes the council abhors it and knows it to be a tool of great power.\n\nThough prompted, Fury resists when they demand she give it to them and threw the talisman that held the sins at them instead, detonating it. Having beaten the Charred Council and leaving their citadel to crumble around them, she beats a hasty retreat by escaping back to Earth. Upon her return to Haven, where the makers guard the last human remnants. She finds it beset by Demons in the Destroyer's army. Having found epiphany on her journey, Fury now realizes this early end war was motivated by the celestial's fear of humanity. With hell's forces heading towards their location, the Makers utilize the same portal created to breach the council chamber as an exit strategy to save what remains of humanity. Fury vowed to protect the last surviving humans and prepares to depart. She requests that Ulthane aid her brother War in any way possible should they meet, now seeing he was innocent all along. As she watches the fight before departing, she realizes the lone human helping the Makers fend off the hellions is actually her brother and fellow horseman; Strife.\n\nWith the survivors now safe and hidden away in another realm, Lucifer knows what Fury has done and depending on the player's choices, is angered at Lilith for not silencing the Lord of Hollows when she had the chance, but still intends to carry out his own plans of destruction.\n\n== Development and release ==\n[[File:Darksiders cosplayers (30547697728).jpg|thumb|Promotion at the 2018 [[PAX West]] ]]\nA third entry in the ''Darksiders'' series was originally planned by [[Vigil Games]], however, the fate of its franchise was threatened due to financial complications. Its parent company, [[THQ]], filed for bankruptcy in 2012. The company's assets were sold at an auction, excluding Vigil Games, which was shut down along with the parent company, THQ. In April 2013, THQ began a process to auction off the remaining IP that it had not yet sold, including ''Darksiders''. Several companies publicly expressed interest in bidding for the franchise, including the Japanese developer [[PlatinumGames]], and [[Crytek USA]], a new [[Crytek]] subsidiary led by former Vigil CEO David Adams, and primarily staffed by former Vigil employees. Adams had expressed interest in allowing ''Darksiders'' to come back \"home\" to its creators.<ref name=\"dt-crytekds\" /><ref name=\"pcn-darksiders\" /> On April 22, 2013, ''Darksiders'', along with ''[[Red Faction]]'' and ''[[MX vs. ATV]]'', were purchased by [[THQ Nordic|Nordic Games]] in the final transaction of THQ's assets. On June 14, 2013, Nordic Games has stated in an interview with [[Joystiq]] that fans \"[should] not look for a ''Darksiders III'' before two years from now\".<ref name=\"joystiq\" />\n\nOn May 2, 2017, a product listing for ''Darksiders III'' appeared on [[Amazon.com]].<ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref name=\"gematsu\" /> The game was announced the same day by publisher [[THQ Nordic]] to be under development by Gunfire Games. The development team largely consists of former Vigil Games employees whose previous work includes development of the first two ''Darksiders'' games.<ref name=\"THQ\" /> The game was revealed to be released on November 27, 2018. Alongside it, THQ Nordic announced various editions for the game; a deluxe edition, which comes with the soundtrack and two future downloadable content packs, the Collector's Edition, which comes with a Fury figurine, and the Apocalypse edition, which comes with figurines of War, Death, Fury and Vulgrim.\n\nOn December 20, 2018, a patch was released for the game adding a \"Classic\" mode to make the game 'feel' more like its two predecessor games, such as allowing Fury to dodge, interrupt her attacks and use items instantly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-darksiders-3-patch-makes-combat-more-like-previous-darksiders-games|title=Darksiders 3 patch makes combat more like previous Darksiders games|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|date=December 21, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Critical response===\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = PC: 70/100<ref name=mcpc>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/darksiders-iii |title=Darksiders III for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=December 26, 2018}}</ref><br />PS4: 64/100<ref name=mcps4>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/darksiders-iii |title=Darksiders III for PlayStation 4 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=December 4, 2018}}</ref><br />XONE: 69/100<ref name=mcxone>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/darksiders-iii |title=Darksiders III for Xbox One Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=December 10, 2018}}</ref>\n| Destruct = 8/10<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-darksiders-iii-531302.phtml |title=Review: Darksiders III |last=Carter |first=Chris |date=December 2, 2018 |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |accessdate=January 2, 2019}}</ref>\n| IGN = 7.0/10<ref name=\"IGNreview\" />\n| PCGUS = 62/100<ref name=\"pcgamerreview\" />\n}}\n\n''Darksiders III'' received \"mixed or average\" reviews, according to review aggregator [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"mcpc\" /><ref name=\"mcxone\" /><ref name=\"mcps4\" />.

It is a sequel to ''[[Darksiders II]]'' and the third entry in the ''[[Darksiders]]'' series.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Darksiders III'' is a great departure from the previous games, borrowing structure and gameplay elements from Metroidvania and [[FromSoftware]]'s Souls series<ref name=\"windowscentral\" /> <ref name=\"IGNreview\" /> <ref name=\"gamespot\" />, the game is viewed as a weird mashup of elements of previous games and a new direction. Players take control of Fury, sister of War and Death, two of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], from a [[Third-person view|third-person]] perspective. Fury, a [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]] who is described as the most unpredictable and enigmatic of the Four Horsemen, relies on whips, swords, flails, daggers and magic in combat.<ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref name=\"THQ\" /> Fury can take on multiple different elemental forms in order to enhance her combat capabilities by granting her new weapons, attacks and traversal abilities.\n\nThe combat is described as more methodical <ref name=\"gamespot\" /> and straight forward<ref name=\"Eurogamerreview\" /> not focusing on large crowds of enemies like the previous games and removing the hit counter. Enemies are stronger than in previous installments but appear in smaller numbers during encounters, so as to make battles feel more personal. Some enemies from previous games return, while other foes are new. Gated combat is not a feature, in an attempt to make everything within the setting contextualized and interconnected like the Souls Series<ref name=\"gamespot\" />.\n\n''Darksiders III'' focuses on its leveling system in which Fury's damage, health, and arcane damage <ref name=\"gamespot\" /> can be upgraded. The threats of the game's world will grow stronger as the player progresses through the story. Similar to War, yet dissimilar to Death, Fury collects souls from enemies and from objects in the environment, as a form of currency or an expendable resource. The player can attach \"Enhancement\"s to Fury's weapons for different perks and damage boosts.<ref name=\"pcgamerreview\" />\n\nThe game takes place in a continuous environment where exploration plays a large role in gathering more lurchers and materials to upgrade Fury itself and her arsenal. While exploring, Fury must solve simple puzzles<ref name=\"Eurogamerreview\" /> and overcome platforming obstacles, some of which make use of her whip. Such puzzles include using bombs to blow up obstructed pathways or Fury's Forms to interact with the environment.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{plot|date=January 2020}}Taking place parallel with ''[[Darksiders II]]'' and happening before the majority of ''[[Darksiders]]'', Fury, one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] is summoned by the Charred Council and tasked in finding the [[Seven Deadly Sins]]; one of the Watchers accompanies her on her quest.\n\nUpon arriving on a war-torn post-apocalyptic [[Earth]], Fury encounters the first of the sins, [[Envy]]. Upon Envy's defeat, Fury steals a talisman and uses it as a prison to hold Envy alongside the other sins she would encounter. Not long after, she finds her way to a tree named Haven where she encounters Ulthane (a previous character from ''Darksiders'') and some surviving humans of the apocalypse. Ulthane tasks Fury with sending any Humans she finds to Haven. She then leaves to find the next sin which is Wrath and Ulthane provides the location for him. Upon arriving to fight Wrath, he is engaged in fighting and killing angels. When she nearly kills Wrath, she summons her horse Rampage which gets killed by a mysterious, angelic weapon. Out of anger, Fury loses focus and Wrath stabs her while he taunts her. With her dying breath, she takes the blade in her gut and uses it to stab Wrath in the face but he does not die due to the fact that he was not imprisoned in the Talisman of sin. As Fury laid dying on the ground, a fiery portal takes her to the Lord of the Hollows. The Lord of the Hollows is a powerful entity within the Hollows that helps Fury in her quest to destroy the Seven Deadly Sins who wields the power that enables both weary Angels and Demons from the endless war, to a complete release from the cycle of life, death and rebirth of the Well of Souls. The Hollow Lord aids Fury but his own goals remain unknown. The Hollow Lord attempts to inform Fury that she is being manipulated by the Charred Council for their own scheme and call her ignorant and blind to their plans and lies. Though Fury denies it, the Lord of the Hollows nonetheless aids her by giving her the powers of elemental hollows (to enhance her combat abilities) and instructs her to hunt down the demon Abraxis and return to him with the demon's soul in tow.\n\nAs Fury takes on one sin after another, the Lord of Hollows continues to endow her with new hollows to aid in her mission. When she makes it to Abraxis' stronghold, Fury wants to know why the Lord of Hollows wants Abraxis dead. Abraxis tells Fury that a new dark lord is coming and he's only known as The Destroyer. The demon explains that the Lord of Hollows intends to hollow the mortal realm to install a new order. Since this is a choice in the story, if you choose to believe in Abraxis, the demon will thank and welcome you to his master's home anytime. Once you make it back to the Lord of Hollows, you'll still have the choice to face him in combat or choose to believe him. If you follow through for Abraxis, the Lord of Hollows will simply be killed. However, if you agree to believe the Lord of Hollows and face Abraxis, you'll kill him and take his soul as the prize. In which the former will reveal details of his own past and the council's corruption. Of how the Lord of Hollows was once a welcome delegate seated at their table, but he soon grew disillusioned with their obsessions and half-measures in enforcing the balance; only monitoring the first and second kingdoms while leaving the third to fend for itself. Culminating in pleading ignorance when in truth they let mankind be devastated by the premature apocalypse on their watch. Going onto explain his hollowing of souls and entrusting his will to Fury was his way of making amends for an eternity of inaction before ending his own life, all while leaving a new item behind for players to use in the future. \n\nAfter Fury defeats Pride, who is the final sin, she references the Hollow Lord while bringing up a stunning revelation in the aftermath of their battle. That the council have been secretly betraying the Balance behind everyone's backs from the start, she asks Fury who unleashed the Seven Deadly upon the Earth or how it was that they came to possess their new powers in order to do away with the rider. The Watcher that has been trailing Fury the whole time reveals herself to be the game's true final sin, the real Envy. Having tricked Fury and the Council to help herself power-up by absorbing the rest of the sins into her amulet, Envy reveals the truth in Pride's words after taking the talisman in order to wield the powers of those trapped within. With that revelation unveiled, Envy took advantage of the debilitated Fury. Using the Talisman of Sin to absorb the Horsemen's strength, weakening her while she was immobilized. \n\nThe sin goes on to say that the Council, which Fury and her brothers served loyally till now, had betrayed them from the beginning, having intended heading the Horsemen and the Sins into battle planning for both sides to destroy each other, resulting in mutually assured annihilation directed towards the council's own benefit. However, Envy boasted of knowing better, all while gloating that jealousy could smell jealousy, having assumed the identity of a trusted servant with the intent of taking advantage of anything and everything available to her; from the horsemen's egotism to the Council's trickery to obtain supreme power for herself. Ultimately, Envy intends to face the Charred Council directly with her enhanced powers for ownership of the Earth and Fury takes a steep fall, but she survives her predicament with help from Humans that she had rescued and turned over to the Makers care, Ulthane aids her by presenting a means he'd spent the whole story working on. Revealing he knew more than was letting on, the Blackhammer constructed a Reflecting Pool to get her to the council's domain and confront Envy as well as her former lords. Recognizing the odd parting gift Fury presented to him after having obtained it from the Hollow Lord, the former later refusing it on the notion he had no right to judge whom his fellow Old One had chosen to wield it. With new resolve, Fury defeats Envy and binds the sin within her own talisman, but the Charred Council no longer values Fury and wants to kill her along with her brothers. If the player has the mysterious stone sigil, Fury will use it to block the Charred Council's attack, the latter halting out of fear of its power. Although she doesn't know the identity of the stone, she realizes the council abhors it and knows it to be a tool of great power.\n\nThough prompted, Fury resists when they demand she give it to them and threw the talisman that held the sins at them instead, detonating it. Having beaten the Charred Council and leaving their citadel to crumble around them, she beats a hasty retreat by escaping back to Earth. Upon her return to Haven, where the makers guard the last human remnants. She finds it beset by Demons in the Destroyer's army. Having found epiphany on her journey, Fury now realizes this early end war was motivated by the celestial's fear of humanity. With hell's forces heading towards their location, the Makers utilize the same portal created to breach the council chamber as an exit strategy to save what remains of humanity. Fury vowed to protect the last surviving humans and prepares to depart. She requests that Ulthane aid her brother War in any way possible should they meet, now seeing he was innocent all along. As she watches the fight before departing, she realizes the lone human helping the Makers fend off the hellions is actually her brother and fellow horseman; Strife.\n\nWith the survivors now safe and hidden away in another realm, Lucifer knows what Fury has done and depending on the player's choices, is angered at Lilith for not silencing the Lord of Hollows when she had the chance, but still intends to carry out his own plans of destruction.\n\n== Development and release ==\n[[File:Darksiders cosplayers (30547697728).jpg|thumb|Promotion at the 2018 [[PAX West]] ]]\nA third entry in the ''Darksiders'' series was originally planned by [[Vigil Games]], however, the fate of its franchise was threatened due to financial complications. Its parent company, [[THQ]], filed for bankruptcy in 2012. The company's assets were sold at an auction, excluding Vigil Games, which was shut down along with the parent company, THQ. In April 2013, THQ began a process to auction off the remaining IP that it had not yet sold, including ''Darksiders''. Several companies publicly expressed interest in bidding for the franchise, including the Japanese developer [[PlatinumGames]], and [[Crytek USA]], a new [[Crytek]] subsidiary led by former Vigil CEO David Adams, and primarily staffed by former Vigil employees. Adams had expressed interest in allowing ''Darksiders'' to come back \"home\" to its creators.<ref name=\"dt-crytekds\" /><ref name=\"pcn-darksiders\" /> On April 22, 2013, ''Darksiders'', along with ''[[Red Faction]]'' and ''[[MX vs. ATV]]'', were purchased by [[THQ Nordic|Nordic Games]] in the final transaction of THQ's assets. On June 14, 2013, Nordic Games has stated in an interview with [[Joystiq]] that fans \"[should] not look for a ''Darksiders III'' before two years from now\".<ref name=\"joystiq\" />\n\nOn May 2, 2017, a product listing for ''Darksiders III'' appeared on [[Amazon.com]].<ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref name=\"gematsu\" /> The game was announced the same day by publisher [[THQ Nordic]] to be under development by Gunfire Games. The development team largely consists of former Vigil Games employees whose previous work includes development of the first two ''Darksiders'' games.<ref name=\"THQ\" /> The game was revealed to be released on November 27, 2018. Alongside it, THQ Nordic announced various editions for the game; a deluxe edition, which comes with the soundtrack and two future downloadable content packs, the Collector's Edition, which comes with a Fury figurine, and the Apocalypse edition, which comes with figurines of War, Death, Fury and Vulgrim.\n\nOn December 20, 2018, a patch was released for the game adding a \"Classic\" mode to make the game 'feel' more like its two predecessor games, such as allowing Fury to dodge, interrupt her attacks and use items instantly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-darksiders-3-patch-makes-combat-more-like-previous-darksiders-games|title=Darksiders 3 patch makes combat more like previous Darksiders games|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|date=December 21, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Critical response===\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = PC: 70/100<ref name=mcpc>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/darksiders-iii |title=Darksiders III for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=December 26, 2018}}</ref><br />PS4: 64/100<ref name=mcps4>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/darksiders-iii |title=Darksiders III for PlayStation 4 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=December 4, 2018}}</ref><br />XONE: 69/100<ref name=mcxone>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/darksiders-iii |title=Darksiders III for Xbox One Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=December 10, 2018}}</ref>\n| Destruct = 8/10<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-darksiders-iii-531302.phtml |title=Review: Darksiders III |last=Carter |first=Chris |date=December 2, 2018 |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |accessdate=January 2, 2019}}</ref>\n| IGN = 7.0/10<ref name=\"IGNreview\" />\n| PCGUS = 62/100<ref name=\"pcgamerreview\" />\n}}\n\n''Darksiders III'' received \"mixed or average\" reviews, according to review aggregator [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"mcpc\" /><ref name=\"mcxone\" /><ref name=\"mcps4\" />.

{"title_page": "Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles", "text_new": "{{short description|List of royal and noble titles in the Ethiopian Empire}}\n{{Contains Ethiopic text}}\n\nUntil the end of the [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopian monarchy]] in 1974, there were two categories of [[nobility]] in [[Ethiopia]]. The '''Mesafint''' ({{lang-gez|\u1218\u1233\u134d\u1295\u1275}} {{transl|gez|''mas\u0101fint''}}, modern {{transl|am|''mes\u0101fint''}}, singular {{lang-gez|\u1218\u1235\u134d\u1295 }} {{transl|gez|''masfin''}}, modern {{transl|am|''mesfin''}}, \"prince\"), the hereditary nobility, formed the upper echelon of the ruling class. The '''Mekwanint''' ({{lang-gez|\u1218\u12b3\u1295\u1295\u1275}}{{transl|sem|''m\u00e4k\u02b7anin''}}, modern {{transl|sem|''m\u00e4k\u02b7enin''}} singular {{lang-gez|\u1218\u12b3\u1295\u1295\u1275}} {{transl|sem|''m\u00e4k\u02b7anin''}}, modern {{transl|sem|''m\u00e4k\u02b7enin''}} or {{lang-am|\u1218\u12ae\u1295\u1295}} {{transl|sem|''mekonnen''}}, \"governor\") were the appointed nobles, often of humble birth, who formed the bulk of the aristocracy. Until the 20th century, the most powerful people at court were generally members of the ''Mekwanint'' appointed by the monarch, while regionally, the ''Mesafint'' enjoyed greater influence and power. Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] greatly curtailed the power of the ''Mesafint'' to the benefit of the ''Mekwanint'', who by then were essentially coterminous with the Ethiopian government.\n\nThe ''Mekwanint'' were officials who had been granted specific offices in the Abyssinian government or court. Higher ranks from the title of ''Ras'' through to ''Balambaras'' were also bestowed upon members of the ''Mekwanint''. A member of the ''Mesafint'', however, would traditionally be given precedence over a member of the ''Mekwanint'' of the same rank. For example, ''Ras'' [[Mengesha Yohannes]], son of Emperor [[Yohannes IV]] and thus a member of the ''Mesafint'', would have outranked ''Ras'' [[Alula Engida]], who was of humble birth and therefore a member of the ''Mekwanint'', even though their ranks were equal.\n\nThere were also parallel rules of precedence, primarily seniority based on age, on offices held, and on when they each obtained their titles, which made the rules for precedence rather complex. Combined with the ambiguous position of titled heirs of members of the ''Mekwanint'', Emperor Haile Selassie, as part of his program of modernising reforms, and in line with his aims of centralising power away from the ''Mesafint'', replaced the traditional system of precedence with a simplified, Western-inspired system that gave precedence by rank, and then by seniority based when the title had been assumed {{ndash}} irrespective of how the title was acquired.<ref name=Seleda />\n\n==Imperial and royal titles==\n\n===''Negusa Nagast''===\n\n[[File:T\u00e9wodros II - 2.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Tewodros II]] of the [[Ethiopian Empire]].]]\nThe '''Negusa Nagast''' ({{Lang-gez|\u1295\u1309\u1220 \u1290\u1308\u1225\u1275}} {{transl|gez|''n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st''}}, \"[[King of Kings]]\") was the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]]. Although several kings of Aksum used this style, until the restoration of the [[Solomonic dynasty]] under [[Yekuno Amlak]], rulers of Ethiopia generally used the style of ''Negus'', although \"King of Kings\" was used as far back as Ezana.\n\nThe full title of the Emperor of Ethiopia was ''Negusa Nagast'' and ''Seyoume Igziabeher'' ({{lang-gez|\u1225\u12e9\u1218 \u12a5\u130d\u12da\u12a0\u1265\u1214\u122d}}; \"Elect of God\"). The title ''Moa Anbessa Ze Imnegede Yehuda'' (\"Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah\") always preceded the titles of the Emperor. It was not a personal title but rather referred to the title of [[Jesus]] and placed the office of Christ ahead of the Emperor's name in an act of Imperial submission. Until the reign of [[Yohannes IV]], the Emperor was also ''Neguse Tsion'' ({{Lang-gez|\u1295\u1309\u1220 \u133d\u12ee\u1295}}, {{transl|sem|''n\u0259gus\u00e4 tsiyon)''}}, \"King of Zion\"), whose seat was at [[Axum]], and which conferred hegemony over much of the north of the Empire.\n\nThe Emperor was referred to by the dignities of the formal ''Girmawi'' ({{Lang-gez|\u130d\u122d\u121b\u12ca}}, {{transl|gez|''g\u00e4rimawi''}}, \"His Imperial Majesty\"), in common speech as ''Janhoy'' ({{Lang-gez|\u1303\u1295\u1206\u12ed}} {{transl|gez|''janihoy''}}, \"Your [Imperial] Majesty, or lit. \"sire\" ), in his own household and family as ''Getochu'' (our Master in the [[Royal we|plural]]), and when referred to by name in the third person with the suffix of ''Atse'' (effectively \"Emperor\", i.e. ''Atse'' Menelik).\n\nAll formal speech concerning the Emperor was in the plural, as was his own speech; [[Haile Selassie]], for instance, referred to himself in the first-person plural at all times, even in casual conversation and when speaking in [[French language|French]] (however this was not the case when he spoke in English, in which he was not fully fluent).<ref name=Vadala>{{cite journal|last1=Vadala|first1=Alexander Atillio|title=Elite Distinction and Regime Change: The Ethiopian Case|journal=Comparative Sociology|date=2011|volume=10|issue=4|page=641|doi=10.1163/156913311X590664}}</ref>\n\n===Negus===\n\n{{main|Negus}}\n\n[[File:Addis Ababa-8e00855u.jpg|thumb|King [[Haile Selassie]] of the [[Solomonic dynasty]].]]\n\nA  '''Negus''' ({{Lang-gez|\u1295\u1309\u1225}} {{transl|gez|''n\u0259gus''}}, \"king\") was a hereditary ruler of one of Ethiopia's larger [[Provinces of Ethiopia|province]]s, over whom collectively the monarch ruled, thus justifying his imperial title. The title of ''Negus'' was awarded at the discretion of the Emperor to those who ruled important provinces, although it was often used hereditarily during and after the [[Zemene Mesafint]]. The rulers of [[Begemder]], [[Shewa]], [[Gojjam]], [[Wollo]], all held the title of Negus at some point, as the \"''Negus'' of Shewa\", \"''Negus'' of Gojjam\", and so forth.\n\nDuring and after the reign of [[Menelik II]] virtually all of the titles either lapsed into the Imperial crown or were dissolved. In 1914, after having been appointed \"''Negus'' of Zion\" by his son [[#Lij|Lij]] Iyasu ([[Iyasu V]]), [[Mikael of Wollo]], in consideration of the hostile feelings this provoked in of much of the nobility in northern Ethiopia (particularly ''Le'ul Ras'' [[Seyoum Mengesha]], whose family had resented being denied the title by Menelik), who were now technically made subordinate to him, instead elected to use the title of ''Negus'' of Wollo. Tafari Makonnen, who later became Emperor Haile Selassie, was bestowed the title of ''Negus'' in 1928; he would be the last person to bear the title.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ethiopia - Tigray 1|url=http://www.royalark.net/Ethiopia/tigray5.htm|website=Royal Ark|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nDespite this, European sources referred to the Ethiopian monarch as the ''Negus'' well into the 20th century, switching to Emperor only after the [[Second World War]] &ndash; around the same time the name [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] fell out of use in favour of [[Ethiopia]] in the west.\n\n===''Le'ul''===\n\n'''Le'ul''' or '''Leul''' ({{Lang-gez|\u120d\u12d1\u120d}} {{transl|gez|''l\u0259\u2018ul''}}, \"Prince\") was a [[prince]]ly style used by sons and grandson of the Emperor.

The '''Mesafint''' ({{lang-gez|\u1218\u1233\u134d\u1295\u1275}} {{transl|gez|''mas\u0101fint''}}, modern {{transl|am|''mes\u0101fint''}}, singular {{lang-gez|\u1218\u1235\u134d\u1295 }} {{transl|gez|''masfin''}}, modern {{transl|am|''mesfin''}}, \"prince\"), the hereditary nobility, formed the upper echelon of the ruling class. The '''Mekwanint''' ({{lang-gez|\u1218\u12b3\u1295\u1295\u1275}}{{transl|sem|''m\u00e4k\u02b7anin''}}, modern {{transl|sem|''m\u00e4k\u02b7enin''}} singular {{lang-gez|\u1218\u12b3\u1295\u1295\u1275}} {{transl|sem|''m\u00e4k\u02b7anin''}}, modern {{transl|sem|''m\u00e4k\u02b7enin''}} or {{lang-am|\u1218\u12ae\u1295\u1295}} {{transl|sem|''mekonnen''}}, \"governor\") were the appointed nobles, often of humble birth, who formed the bulk of the aristocracy. Until the 20th century, the most powerful people at court were generally members of the ''Mekwanint'' appointed by the monarch, while regionally, the ''Mesafint'' enjoyed greater influence and power. Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] greatly curtailed the power of the ''Mesafint'' to the benefit of the ''Mekwanint'', who by then were essentially coterminous with the Ethiopian government.\n\nThe ''Mekwanint'' were officials who had been granted specific offices in the Abyssinian government or court. Higher ranks from the title of ''Ras'' through to ''Balambaras'' were also bestowed upon members of the ''Mekwanint''. A member of the ''Mesafint'', however, would traditionally be given precedence over a member of the ''Mekwanint'' of the same rank. For example, ''Ras'' [[Mengesha Yohannes]], son of Emperor [[Yohannes IV]] and thus a member of the ''Mesafint'', would have outranked ''Ras'' [[Alula Engida]], who was of humble birth and therefore a member of the ''Mekwanint'', even though their ranks were equal.\n\nThere were also parallel rules of precedence, primarily seniority based on age, on offices held, and on when they each obtained their titles, which made the rules for precedence rather complex. Combined with the ambiguous position of titled heirs of members of the ''Mekwanint'', Emperor Haile Selassie, as part of his program of modernising reforms, and in line with his aims of centralising power away from the ''Mesafint'', replaced the traditional system of precedence with a simplified, Western-inspired system that gave precedence by rank, and then by seniority based when the title had been assumed {{ndash}} irrespective of how the title was acquired.<ref name=Seleda />\n\n==Imperial and royal titles==\n\n===''Negusa Nagast''===\n\n[[File:T\u00e9wodros II - 2.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Tewodros II]] of the [[Ethiopian Empire]].]]\nThe '''Negusa Nagast''' ({{Lang-gez|\u1295\u1309\u1220 \u1290\u1308\u1225\u1275}} {{transl|gez|''n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st''}}, \"[[King of Kings]]\") was the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]].

The title ''Moa Anbessa Ze Imnegede Yehuda'' (\"Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah\") always preceded the titles of the Emperor.

The rulers of [[Begemder]], [[Shewa]], [[Gojjam]], [[Wollo]], all held the title of Negus at some point, as the \"''Negus'' of Shewa\", \"''Negus'' of Gojjam\", and so forth.\n\nDuring and after the reign of [[Menelik II]] virtually all of the titles either lapsed into the Imperial crown or were dissolved. In 1914, after having been appointed \"''Negus'' of Zion\" by his son [[#Lij|Lij]] Iyasu ([[Iyasu V]]), [[Mikael of Wollo]], in consideration of the hostile feelings this provoked in of much of the nobility in northern Ethiopia (particularly ''Le'ul Ras'' [[Seyoum Mengesha]], whose family had resented being denied the title by Menelik), who were now technically made subordinate to him, instead elected to use the title of ''Negus'' of Wollo.

He always wants to know a character's needs, and what's beneath those needs. Then he takes all that material and somehow embeds it into the character and physically inhabits the character, so that you never think he's playing the character. It's fascinating to watch him close up. He carries the emotional complexities in every tiny gesture that his character makes so that you immediately can see what his character is like. A character like Roger is full of contradictions, a city banker with an air of entitlement but also a little insecurity picking away at him. Toby can portray that in his walk alone. That's what's great about him, he can portray cold he can portray warm and he can portray both of those things at once.\"<ref name=\"BBC Writers Room blog 23 November 2015\">{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/writersroom/entries/0c48aec7-510a-45e5-813f-54c6ba237660|title= Adapting 'Capital' for BBC One|author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 23 November 2015|website= [[BBC Online]]|accessdate= 30 November 2015|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151128040423/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/writersroom/entries/0c48aec7-510a-45e5-813f-54c6ba237660|archivedate= 28 November 2015|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHe plays [[Captain Mainwaring]] in the film ''[[Dad's Army (2016 film)|Dad's Army]]'', released in February 2016.

He always wants to know a character's needs, and what's beneath those needs. Then he takes all that material and somehow embeds it into the character and physically inhabits the character, so that you never think he's playing the character. It's fascinating to watch him close up. He carries the emotional complexities in every tiny gesture that his character makes so that you immediately can see what his character is like. A character like Roger is full of contradictions, a city banker with an air of entitlement but also a little insecurity picking away at him. Toby can portray that in his walk alone. That's what's great about him, he can portray cold he can portray warm and he can portray both of those things at once.\"<ref name=\"BBC Writers Room blog 23 November 2015\">{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/writersroom/entries/0c48aec7-510a-45e5-813f-54c6ba237660|title= Adapting 'Capital' for BBC One|author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 23 November 2015|website= [[BBC Online]]|accessdate= 30 November 2015|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151128040423/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/writersroom/entries/0c48aec7-510a-45e5-813f-54c6ba237660|archivedate= 28 November 2015|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHe plays [[Captain Mainwaring]] in the film ''[[Dad's Army (2016 film)|Dad's Army]]'', released in February 2016.

{"title_page": "China-Thailand meme war", "text_new": "The '''China-Thailand meme war''' refers to an online incident between [[netizens]] in [[mainland China]] and netizens in [[Thailand]] and other regions including [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Philippines]] that occurred in April 2020. \n\nThe cause of the incident was that some mainland Chinese netizens thought that Weeraya, the girlfriend of Thai actor [[Vachirawit Chiva-aree]] (aka \"Bright\") (known on Twitter as \"nnevvy\"), made [[Taiwan independence]] remarks online, that Bright and liked online rumors about the origin of [[SARS-CoV-2]], that Bright reposted an article about the [[2019-20 Hong Kong protests]]. The two were accused of \"insulting China\" by mainland Chinese netizens, and asked to apologized publicly. \n\nThe behavior of mainland Chinese netizens caused dissatisfaction among Thai netizens, and the two sides immediately engaged in a scolding battle (meme war). In the process, they also attracted netizens from Hong Kong, Taiwan and some Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam and the Philippines to support the Thai side. The incident later rose to affect [[foreign relations]] between the two countries, and both Chinese and Thai officials responded to the incident.<ref>[https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/asia/nnevvy-china-taiwan-twitter-intl-hnk/index.html CNN: Nnevvy: Chinese troll campaign on Twitter exposes a potentially dangerous disconnect with the wider world]</ref>\n\n==Background==\nOn April 11, 2020, some mainland Chinese netizens found online conversations between Thai actor [[Vachirawit Chiva-aree]] (Bright) and online celebrity girlfriend Weeraya (Twitter name \"nnevvy\") from two years ago. In the conversations, when Weeraya was travelling to [[Taiwan]] in 2018, Bright commented on a photo and said \"Looks like a Chinese girl\". Weeraya replied \"What?\" Other netizens left a message and asked, \"What style is this today?\" Weeraya replied, \"Taiwanese girl.\" Some mainland Chinese netizens interpreted this dialogue as Weeraya supporting [[Taiwanese independence]]. Some mainland Chinese netizens also mentioned that Weeraya once tweeted alternative theories around the origin of [[SARS-CoV-2]], and that Bright also praised the tweet. In addition, Bright had also reposted an article about the [[2019 Hong Kong extradition bill]] that sparked the [[2019-20 Hong Kong protests]]. Since the article listed [[Hong Kong]] as a country, Bright publicly apologized to mainland Chinese netizens. Afterwards, mainland Chinese netizens brigaded Weeraya's Twitter and Instagram accounts with messages, accusing them of \"humiliating China\" and demanding an apology. The hashtag #\u6cf0\u570b\u8fb1\u83ef (#ThailandInsultsChina) was promoted onto [[Weibo]]'s top searches list, and the Thai TV series [[2gether: The Series (Thai TV series)]] was brigaded with negative comments on [[Douban]].<ref>[https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/17/nnevvy-bright-firewall-thailand-china-online-army/ Thais Beat China's Online Warriors - Foreign Policy]</ref>\n\n==Incident==\nThai netizens felt dissatisfied at the behavior of mainland Chinese netizens, and immediately went to Bright and Weeraya\u2019s social media accounts to support the two. \n\nNetizens from both [[China]] and [[Thailand]] immediately launched a scolding battle (meme war). Thai netizens questioned why China did not apologize for the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]], and said \"Taiwan is an independent country\", questioning why [[mainland Chinese]] citizens needed a [[visa]] to visit [[Taiwan]], but [[Thai]] citizens did not need a visa to go to [[Pattaya]]. During the dispute, netizens from the [[Philippines]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Hong Kong]] also joined the war in solidarity with the Thai side, and the #nnevvy hashtag was added to Twitter.\n\nThe focus of the scolding war then gradually shifted to topics such as the leaders of [[China]] and [[Thailand]], food culture and historical events in the two places. Mainland Chinese netizens insulted the Thai king [[Rama X]] and asked \"Where are your kings going?\". Thai netizens asked the mainland Chinese netizens to \"speak again\", \"speak louder\" and responded with \"we are also looking for him, thank you for your concern!\". Mainland Chinese netizens also insulted Thai netizens with \"nmsl\" (\"Your mother is dead\" in Chinese [[pinyin]]) and similar phrases. Thai netizens responded, \"we have 20 mothers\" (a reference to [[Rama X]]'s retreat in Paris during the coronavirus pandemic) and ridiculed the many Thai queen palaces. Mainland Chinese netizens called Thailand's prime minister \"stupid\" and government \"very trash\", Thai netizens expressed their agreement and asked the other party to \"speak louder.\" Thai netizens accused Chinese state leader [[Xi Jinping]] for his policies. They also satirized China\u2019s lack of freedom and expressed their support for Taiwan and Hong Kong\u2019s independence. On the topic of food culture, mainland Chinese netizens said that Thai food is not appetizing, but Thai netizens responded \"because you all eat bats\". Since Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Thailand all have unique and famous [[milk teas]], the three countries started calling each other \"milk tea\" in solidarity. In addition, mainland Chinese netizens were noted for being only able to use [[swear words]] such as \"NMSL\" and \"CNMB\" (\"fuck your mother's cunt\"). The Thai netizens counterattacked that the netizens were not \"[[Chinese]]\" but \"Nmslese\" (\"your mother is dead\" people). Thai netizens also used \"June 4th\", \"[[Tiananmen Incident]]\", \"[[1989]]\" and other sensitive keywords in mainland China to attack the other side. Mainland Chinese netizens countered with the [[Thammasat University massacre]] in 1976, but Thai netizens asked the other side to \"speak louder\", and responded that \"unlike some countries, our government will not hide the truth from people\" and \"are you ready to face the incidents of 1989?\".\n\n[[Joshua Wong]], a Hong Kong democracy activist, also vocally supported the \"Milk Tea Alliance\".<ref>[https://twitter.com/joshuawongcf/status/1249254158538072064 Joshua Wong on Twitter: \"1.
