It was designed by [[Piasecki Helicopter|Vertol]] and manufactured by [[Boeing Helicopters|Boeing Vertol]] following Vertol's acquisition by [[Boeing]].\n\nDevelopment of the Sea Knight, which was originally designated by the firm as the '''Vertol Model 107''', commenced during 1956. It was envisioned as a successor to the first generation of rotorcraft, such as the [[Piasecki H-21|H-21]] \"Flying Banana\", that had been powered by [[Reciprocating engine|piston engines]]; in its place, the '''V-107''' made use of the emergent [[turboshaft]] engine. On 22 April 1958, the V-107 prototype performed its [[maiden flight]]. During June 1958, the US Army awarded a contract for the construction of ten production-standard aircraft, designated as the '''YHC-1A''', based on the V-107; this initial order was later cut down to three YHC-1As though. During 1961, the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] (USMC), who had been studying its requirements for a medium-lift, twin-turbine cargo/troop assault helicopter, selected Boeing Vertol's '''Model 107M''' as the basis from which to manufacture a suitable rotorcraft to meet their needs. Known colloquially as the \"Phrog\" and formally as the \"Sea Knight\", it was operated across all US Marine Corps' operational environments between its introduction during the [[Vietnam War]] and its frontline retirement during 2014.\n \nThe Sea Knight was operated by the USMC to provide all-weather, day-or-night assault transport of combat troops, supplies and equipment until it was replaced by the [[MV-22 Osprey]] during the 2010s. The USMC also used the helicopter for [[combat support#United States Marine Corps|combat support]], [[search and rescue]] (SAR), [[CASEVAC|casualty evacuation]] and Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP). The Sea Knight also functioned as the [[US Navy]]'s standard medium-lift [[utility helicopter]] prior to the type being phased out of service in favor of the [[MH-60S Knighthawk]] during the early 2000s. Several overseas operators acquired the rotorcraft as well. [[Canada]] operated the Sea Knight, designated as '''CH-113'''; the type was used predominantly in the [[search and rescue]] (SAR) role until 2004. Other export customers for the type included [[Japan]], [[Sweden]], and [[Saudi Arabia]]. The commercial version of the rotorcraft is the '''BV 107-II''', commonly referred to simply as the \"Vertol\".\n\n==Development==\n===Origins===\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, American rotorcraft manufacturer [[Piasecki Helicopter]] emerged as a pioneering developer of [[Tandem rotors|tandem-rotor]] helicopters; perhaps the most famous of these being the piston-powered [[Piasecki H-21|H-21]] \"Flying Banana\", an early utility and transport helicopter. During 1955, Piasecki was officially renamed as [[Piasecki Helicopter|Vertol Corporation]] (standing for [[VTOL|vertical take-off and landing]]); it was around this time that work commenced on the development of a new generation of tandem rotor helicopter. During 1956, the new design received the internal company designation of ''Vertol Model 107'', or simply ''V-107''; this rotorcraft differed from its predecessors by harnessing the newly developed [[turboshaft]] engine instead of piston-based counterparts. During that year, construction of a prototype, powered by a pair of [[Lycoming T53]] [[turboshaft]] engines, each one being capable of producing 877 shp (640&nbsp;kW), commenced.<ref name=Apostolo>Apostolo, Giorgio. \"Boeing Vertol Model 107\". ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Helicopters''. New York: Bonanza Books. 1984. {{ISBN|978-0-517-43935-7}}.</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 1958, the V-107 prototype performed its [[maiden flight]].<ref name=Donald_V-107/> In order to garner publicity for the newly developed rotorcraft, it was decided to use the prototype to conduct a series of publicised flight demonstrations during a tour across the United States and several overseas nations. During June 1958, it was announced that the U.S. Army had awarded a contract to Vertol for the construction of ten production-standard aircraft based on the V-107, which were designated ''YHC-1A''.<ref name=\"whirly\">Spenser, Jay P.

Spenser, the cutback had been enacted in order that the U.S. Army would be able to divert funds for the development of the rival ''V-114'' helicopter, which was also a turbine-powered tandem rotor design but substantially larger than the V-107.<ref name=\"whirly\"/> All of the U.S. Army's three YHC-1As were powered by pairs of [[General Electric T58|GE-T-58]] engines. During August 1959, the first YHC-1A-model rotorcraft conducted its first flight; independently, it was shortly followed by the maiden flight of an improved model intended for the commercial and export markets, designated ''107-II''.<ref name=\"CH-46_hist_USN\">[http://www.history.navy.mil/planes/ch46.htm CH-46 history page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203202119/http://www.history.navy.mil/planes/ch46.htm |date=3 December 2007 }}.

During November 1964, the introduction of the Marines' CH-46A and the Navy's UH-46As commenced. The UH-46A variant was a modified version of the rotorcraft to perform the [[vertical replenishment]] mission.<ref name=\"CH-46_hist_USN\"/> The CH-46A was equipped with a pair of T58-GE8-8B turboshaft engines, each being rated at 1,250 shp (930&nbsp;kW); these allowed the Sea Knight to carry up to 17 passengers or a maximum of 4,000 pounds (1,815&nbsp;kg) of cargo.<ref name=\"vect_CH-46\"/>\n\n===Further developments===\nDuring 1966, production of the improved ''CH-46D'' commenced with deliveries following shortly thereafter. This model featured various improvements, including modified [[rotor blade]]s and the adoption of more powerful T58-GE-10 turboshaft engines,<ref name=\"CH-46_hist_USN\"/> rated at {{convert|1400|shp|kW|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} each. The increased power of these new engines allowed the CH-46D to carry an increased payload, such as up to 25 troops or a maximum of {{convert|7000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}} of cargo.<ref name=\"vect_CH-46\"/> During late 1967, the improved model was introduced to the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam theater]], where it supplemented the U.S. Marine Corps' existing CH-46A fleet, which had proven to be relatively unreliable and problematic in service.<ref>Rottman and Hook 2007, p. 10.</ref> Along with the USMC's CH-46Ds, the U.S. Navy also acquired a small number of UH-46Ds for ship resupply purposes.<ref name=\"Eden\">Eden, Paul, ed. \"Boeing-Vertol H-46 Sea Knight\", ''Encyclopedia of Modern Military Aircraft''.

This model retained the T58-GE-10 engines used on the CH-46D while featuring revised avionics and featured a number of other modifications. The CH-46F was the final production model of the type.<ref name=\"CH-46_hist_USN\"/> During its service life, the Sea Knight received a variety of upgrades and modifications. Over time, the majority of the U.S. Marine Corps' Sea Knights were upgraded to the improved CH-46E standard. This model featured [[fiberglass]] rotor blades, reinforcement measures throughout the airframe, along with the refitting of further uprated T58-GE-16 engines, capable of producing {{convert|1870|shp|kW|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} each; in addition, several CH-46Es were modified to double their maximum fuel capacity.<ref name=\"vect_CH-46\"/> Starting in the mid-1990s, the Dynamic Component Upgrade (DCU) programmes was enacted, focusing on the implementation of strengthened drive systems and modified rotor controls.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe commercial variant, the ''BV 107-II'', was first ordered by [[New York Airways]] during 1960. During July 1962, they took delivery of their first three aircraft, which was configured to seat up to 25 passengers.<ref name=\"vert_Tandom\"/> During 1965, Boeing Vertol sold the manufacturing rights of the 107 to Japanese [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]]. Under this arrangement, all Model 107 civilian and military aircraft [[#Japanese versions|built in Japan]] were referred to by the ''KV 107'' designation.<ref name=\"vert_Tandom\"/> On 15 December 2006, [[Columbia Helicopters, Inc]] acquired the [[type certificate]] for the BV 107-II; at the time, the company was reportedly in the process of acquiring a Production Certificate from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA). Plans for actual production of the aircraft were not announced.<ref name=\"vert_Tandom\"/>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:US Navy 020514-M-7364D-002 Exercise Cobra Gold 2002.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A U.S. Marine watches two CH-46 Sea Knights, 2002]]\n\nThe ''Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight'' is a medium-lift [[tandem rotors|tandem-rotor]] [[transport helicopter]], furnished with a set of counter-rotating main rotors in a [[tandem rotor|tandem-rotor]] configuration. It was typically powered by a pair of [[General Electric T58]] [[turboshaft]] engines, which were mounted on each side of the rear rotor pedestal; power to the forward rotor was transferred from the rear-mounted engines via a [[drive shaft]]. For redundancy, both engines are coupled so that either one would be capable of powering both of the main rotors in the event of a single engine failure or a similar emergency situation. Each of the rotors feature three [[rotor blade|blade]]s, which can be folded to better facilitate storage and naval operations.<ref name=\"vect_CH-46\">[http://www.airvectors.net/avch47_1.html \"Boeing Sea Knight\"]. Vectorsite.net, 1 August 2011.</ref> The CH-46 features a fixed [[tricycle landing gear]], complete with twin wheels on all three legs of the landing gear; this configuration results in a nose-up stance, helping to facilitate cargo loading and unloading. Two of the main landing gear were installed within protruding rear [[sponson]]s; the free interior space of the sponsons are also used to house fuel tanks, possessing a total capacity of 350 US gallons (1,438 L).<ref name=\"vect_CH-46\"/>\n\nThe interior of the CH-46 was largely taken up by its cargo bay, complete with a rear loading ramp that could be removed or left open in flight for the carriage of extended cargoes or for parachute drops. Various furnishings were normally provided to aid in its use as a utility rotorcraft, such as an internal [[winch]] mounted within the forward cabin, which can be used to assisting loading by pulling external cargo on [[pallet]]s into the aircraft via the ramp and rollers, and an optionally-attached belly-mounted [[Cargo hook (helicopter)|cargo hook]], which would be usually rated at {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} for carrying cargoes externally underneath the Sea Knight; despite the hook having been rated at {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}}, this was safety restricted to less payload as they got older. When operated in a typical configuration, the CH-46 would usually be operated by a crew of three; a larger crew could be accommodated when required, which would be dependent upon mission specifics. For example, a [[search and rescue]] (SAR) variant would usually carry a crew of five (Pilot, Co-Pilot, Crew Chief, Swimmer, and Medic) to facilitate all aspects of such operations. For self-defense, a [[pintle]]-mounted [[M2 Browning|0.50 in (12.7&nbsp;mm) Browning]] [[machine gun]] could be mounted on each side of the helicopter.<ref name=\"vect_CH-46\"/> Service in southeast Asia resulted in the addition of [[armor]] along with the machine guns.<ref name=\"CH-46_hist_USN\"/>\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===United States===\n[[File:CH-46 Shot down during Operation Hastings.jpg|thumb|A flaming Marine CH-46 of HMM-265, after being hit by enemy AAA fire in \"[[Helicopter Valley]]\", 15 July 1966.<ref>{{cite news |last=King |first=Tim |date=23 April 2012 |title=Vietnam's Helicopter Valley: Graveyard of Marine CH-46's |url=http://www.salem-news.com/articles/april232012/helicopter-valley-tk.php |newspaper=Salem-News.com |location=Salem, OR |accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref>]]\n\nKnown colloquially as the \"Phrog\", the Sea Knight was used in all U.S. Marine operational environments between its introduction during the [[Vietnam War]] and its frontline retirement in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helis.com/60s/h_h46.php|title=Boeing Vertol 107 \u2013 CH-46 Sea Knight|publisher=Helis.com|work=Helicopter History Site}}</ref> The type's longevity and reputation for reliability led to mantras such as \"phrogs phorever\" and \"never trust a helicopter under 30\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ask A Marine|publisher=HMM-364 Purple Foxy Ladies|url=http://www.purplefoxyladies.com/ask.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230060309/http://purplefoxyladies.com/ask.html|archivedate=30 December 2006}}</ref> CH-46s transported personnel, evacuated wounded, supplied forward arming and refueling points (FARP), performed vertical replenishment, search and rescue, recovered downed aircraft and crews and other tasks.\n\n====Vietnam War====\nDuring the Vietnam War, the CH-46 was one of the prime US Marine troop transport helicopters in the theater, slotting between the smaller [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois]] and larger [[Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion]]. CH-46 operations were plagued by major technical problems; the engines, being prone to [[foreign object damage]] (FOD) from debris being ingested when hovering close to the ground and subsequently suffering a [[compressor stall]], had a lifespan as low as 85 flight hours; on 21 July 1966, all CH-46s were grounded until more efficient filters had been fitted.<ref>Dunstan 2003, pp. 182\u2013184.</ref>\n\nOn 3 May 1967, a CH-46D at [[Marine Corps Air Station Tustin|Marine Corps Air Facility Santa Ana]] crashed, killing all four members of the crew. Within three days the accident investigators had determined that the mounting brackets of the main transmission had failed, allowing the front and rear overlapping rotors to intermesh. All CH\u201346s were temporarily grounded for inspection. On 13 May, a CH\u201346A crashed off the coast of Vietnam when the tail pylon containing the engines, main transmission and aft rotors broke off in flight. All four crew members were killed. On 20 June, another CH\u201346A crashed, though two of the four-man crew survived. Once again, even though the aircraft was not recovered from the water, failure of some sort in the rear pylon was suspected. On 30 June a CH-46D at Santa Ana crashed when a rotor blade separated from the aircraft, all three of the crew survived. As a result of this latest accident, all CH-46Ds were immediately grounded, but the CH-46As continued flying. On 3 July another CH-46A crashed in Vietnam, killing all four Marines of its crew.

The refurbished Voyageurs were re-designated as CH-113A Labradors, thus a total of 15 Labradors were ultimately in service.<ref name=\"CAM\" />\n\n[[File:Labrador helicopter landing Bell Island.jpg|thumb|upright|left|CH-113 Labrador landing on \"The Clapper\", a [[sea stack]] off the tip of [[Bell Island (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Bell Island]] in Newfoundland]]\nThe Labrador was fitted with a watertight hull for marine landings, a 5,000 kilogram cargo hook and an external rescue hoist mounted over the right front door. It featured a 1,110 kilometer flying range, emergency medical equipment and an 18-person passenger capacity. By the 1990s, heavy use and hostile weather conditions had taken their toll on the Labrador fleet, resulting in increasing maintenance costs and the need for prompt replacement.<ref name=\"CAM\" /> In 1981, a mid-life upgrade of the fleet was carried out by [[Boeing Canada]] in [[Arnprior, Ontario]]. Known as the SAR-CUP (Search and Rescue Capability Upgrade Program), the refit scheme included new instrumentation, a nose-mounted weather radar, a tail-mounted auxiliary power unit, a new high-speed rescue hoist mounted over the side door and front-mounted searchlights. A total of six CH-113s and five CH-113As were upgraded with the last delivered in 1984.<ref name=\"CAM\" />\n\nIn 1992, it was announced that the Labradors were to be replaced by 15 new helicopters, a variant of the [[AgustaWestland EH101]], designated ''CH-149 Chimo''. The order was subsequently cancelled by the [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government in 1993, resulting in cancellation penalties, as well as extending the service life of the Labrador fleet. However, in 1998, a CH-113 from [[CFB Greenwood]] crashed on Quebec's [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]] while returning from a SAR mission, resulting in the deaths of all crewmembers on board. The crash placed pressure upon the government to procure a replacement, thus an order was placed with the manufacturers of the EH101 for 15 aircraft to perform the search-and-rescue mission, designated ''[[CH-149 Cormorant]]''. CH-149 deliveries began in 2003, allowing the last CH-113 to be retired in 2004.<ref name=\"CAM\" /> In October 2005 [[Columbia Helicopters]] of [[Aurora, Oregon]] purchased eight of the retired CH-113 Labradors to add to their fleet of 15 Vertol 107-II helicopters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shephard.co.uk/Rotorhub/default.aspx?Action=745115149&ID=c186be12-8152-418b-9b56-ec198753da2e|title=Columbia Helicopters Acquires eight CH-113 Labrador helicopters from Canadian military|publisher=RotorHub.com|work=RotorHub|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222234834/http://www.shephard.co.uk/Rotorhub/default.aspx?Action=745115149&ID=c186be12-8152-418b-9b56-ec198753da2e |archivedate=22 December 2007|accessdate=5 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\nIn 1963, Sweden procured ten UH-46Bs from the US as a transport and anti-submarine helicopter for the Swedish armed forces, designated Hkp 4A.

It was designed by [[Piasecki Helicopter|Vertol]] and manufactured by [[Boeing Helicopters|Boeing Vertol]] following Vertol's acquisition by [[Boeing]].\n\nDevelopment of the Sea Knight, which was originally designated by the firm as the '''Vertol Model 107''', commenced during 1956. It was envisioned as a successor to the first generation of rotorcraft, such as the [[Piasecki H-21|H-21]] \"Flying Banana\", that had been powered by [[Reciprocating engine|piston engines]]; in its place, the '''V-107''' made use of the emergent [[turboshaft]] engine. On 22 April 1958, the V-107 prototype performed its [[maiden flight]]. During June 1958, the US Army awarded a contract for the construction of ten production-standard aircraft, designated as the '''YHC-1A''', based on the V-107; this initial order was later cut down to three YHC-1As though. During 1961, the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] (USMC), who had been studying its requirements for a medium-lift, twin-turbine cargo/troop assault helicopter, selected Boeing Vertol's '''Model 107M''' as the basis from which to manufacture a suitable rotorcraft to meet their needs. Known colloquially as the \"Phrog\" and formally as the \"Sea Knight\", it was operated across all US Marine Corps' operational environments between its introduction during the [[Vietnam War]] and its frontline retirement during 2014.\n \nThe Sea Knight was operated by the USMC to provide all-weather, day-or-night assault transport of combat troops, supplies and equipment until it was replaced by the [[MV-22 Osprey]] during the 2010s. The USMC also used the helicopter for [[combat support#United States Marine Corps|combat support]], [[search and rescue]] (SAR), [[CASEVAC|casualty evacuation]] and Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP). The Sea Knight also functioned as the [[US Navy]]'s standard medium-lift [[utility helicopter]] prior to the type being phased out of service in favor of the [[MH-60S Knighthawk]] during the early 2000s. Several overseas operators acquired the rotorcraft as well. [[Canada]] operated the Sea Knight, designated as '''CH-113'''; the type was used predominantly in the [[search and rescue]] (SAR) role until 2004. Other export customers for the type included [[Japan]], [[Sweden]], and [[Saudi Arabia]]. The commercial version of the rotorcraft is the '''BV 107-II''', commonly referred to simply as the \"Vertol\".\n\n==Development==\n===Origins===\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, American rotorcraft manufacturer [[Piasecki Helicopter]] emerged as a pioneering developer of [[Tandem rotors|tandem-rotor]] helicopters; perhaps the most famous of these being the piston-powered [[Piasecki H-21|H-21]] \"Flying Banana\", an early utility and transport helicopter. During 1955, Piasecki was officially renamed as [[Piasecki Helicopter|Vertol Corporation]] (standing for [[VTOL|vertical take-off and landing]]); it was around this time that work commenced on the development of a new generation of tandem rotor helicopter. During 1956, the new design received the internal company designation of ''Vertol Model 107'', or simply ''V-107''; this rotorcraft differed from its predecessors by harnessing the newly developed [[turboshaft]] engine instead of piston-based counterparts. During that year, construction of a prototype, powered by a pair of [[Lycoming T53]] [[turboshaft]] engines, each one being capable of producing 877 shp (640&nbsp;kW), commenced.<ref name=Apostolo>Apostolo, Giorgio. \"Boeing Vertol Model 107\". ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Helicopters''. New York: Bonanza Books. 1984. {{ISBN|978-0-517-43935-7}}.</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 1958, the V-107 prototype performed its [[maiden flight]].<ref name=Donald_V-107/> In order to garner publicity for the newly developed rotorcraft, it was decided to use the prototype to conduct a series of publicised flight demonstrations during a tour across the United States and several overseas nations. During June 1958, it was announced that the U.S. Army had awarded a contract to Vertol for the construction of ten production-standard aircraft based on the V-107, which were designated ''YHC-1A''.<ref name=\"whirly\">Spenser, Jay P. ''Whirlybirds, A History of the U.S. Helicopter Pioneers''. University of Washington Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-295-97699-3}} {{page needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> However, this order was later decreased to three helicopters; according to aviation author Jay P. Spenser, the cutback had been enacted in order that the U.S. Army would be able to divert funds for the development of the rival ''V-114'' helicopter, which was also a turbine-powered tandem rotor design but substantially larger than the V-107.<ref name=\"whirly\"/> All of the U.S. Army's three YHC-1As were powered by pairs of [[General Electric T58|GE-T-58]] engines. During August 1959, the first YHC-1A-model rotorcraft conducted its first flight; independently, it was shortly followed by the maiden flight of an improved model intended for the commercial and export markets, designated ''107-II''.<ref name=\"CH-46_hist_USN\">[http://www.history.navy.mil/planes/ch46.htm CH-46 history page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203202119/http://www.history.navy.mil/planes/ch46.htm |date=3 December 2007 }}.

During November 1964, the introduction of the Marines' CH-46A and the Navy's UH-46As commenced. The UH-46A variant was a modified version of the rotorcraft to perform the [[vertical replenishment]] mission.<ref name=\"CH-46_hist_USN\"/> The CH-46A was equipped with a pair of T58-GE8-8B turboshaft engines, each being rated at 1,250 shp (930&nbsp;kW); these allowed the Sea Knight to carry up to 17 passengers or a maximum of 4,000 pounds (1,815&nbsp;kg) of cargo.<ref name=\"vect_CH-46\"/>\n\n===Further developments===\nDuring 1966, production of the improved ''CH-46D'' commenced with deliveries following shortly thereafter. This model featured various improvements, including modified [[rotor blade]]s and the adoption of more powerful T58-GE-10 turboshaft engines,<ref name=\"CH-46_hist_USN\"/> rated at {{convert|1400|shp|kW|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} each. The increased power of these new engines allowed the CH-46D to carry an increased payload, such as up to 25 troops or a maximum of {{convert|7000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}} of cargo.<ref name=\"vect_CH-46\"/> During late 1967, the improved model was introduced to the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam theater]], where it supplemented the U.S. Marine Corps' existing CH-46A fleet, which had proven to be relatively unreliable and problematic in service.<ref>Rottman and Hook 2007, p. 10.</ref> Along with the USMC's CH-46Ds, the U.S. Navy also acquired a small number of UH-46Ds for ship resupply purposes.<ref name=\"Eden\">Eden, Paul, ed. \"Boeing-Vertol H-46 Sea Knight\", ''Encyclopedia of Modern Military Aircraft''.

This model retained the T58-GE-10 engines used on the CH-46D while featuring revised avionics and featured a number of other modifications. The CH-46F was the final production model of the type.<ref name=\"CH-46_hist_USN\"/> During its service life, the Sea Knight received a variety of upgrades and modifications. Over time, the majority of the U.S. Marine Corps' Sea Knights were upgraded to the improved CH-46E standard. This model featured [[fiberglass]] rotor blades, reinforcement measures throughout the airframe, along with the refitting of further uprated T58-GE-16 engines, capable of producing {{convert|1870|shp|kW|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} each; in addition, several CH-46Es were modified to double their maximum fuel capacity.<ref name=\"vect_CH-46\"/> Starting in the mid-1990s, the Dynamic Component Upgrade (DCU) programmes was enacted, focusing on the implementation of strengthened drive systems and modified rotor controls.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe commercial variant, the ''BV 107-II'', was first ordered by [[New York Airways]] during 1960. During July 1962, they took delivery of their first three aircraft, which was configured to seat up to 25 passengers.<ref name=\"vert_Tandom\"/> During 1965, Boeing Vertol sold the manufacturing rights of the 107 to Japanese [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]]. Under this arrangement, all Model 107 civilian and military aircraft [[#Japanese versions|built in Japan]] were referred to by the ''KV 107'' designation.<ref name=\"vert_Tandom\"/> On 15 December 2006, [[Columbia Helicopters, Inc]] acquired the [[type certificate]] for the BV 107-II; at the time, the company was reportedly in the process of acquiring a Production Certificate from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA). Plans for actual production of the aircraft were not announced.<ref name=\"vert_Tandom\"/>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:US Navy 020514-M-7364D-002 Exercise Cobra Gold 2002.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A U.S. Marine watches two CH-46 Sea Knights, 2002]]\n\nThe ''Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight'' is a medium-lift [[tandem rotors|tandem-rotor]] [[transport helicopter]], furnished with a set of counter-rotating main rotors in a [[tandem rotor|tandem-rotor]] configuration. It was typically powered by a pair of [[General Electric T58]] [[turboshaft]] engines, which were mounted on each side of the rear rotor pedestal; power to the forward rotor was transferred from the rear-mounted engines via a [[drive shaft]]. For redundancy, both engines are coupled so that either one would be capable of powering both of the main rotors in the event of a single engine failure or a similar emergency situation. Each of the rotors feature three [[rotor blade|blade]]s, which can be folded to better facilitate storage and naval operations.<ref name=\"vect_CH-46\">[http://www.airvectors.net/avch47_1.html \"Boeing Sea Knight\"]. Vectorsite.net, 1 August 2011.</ref> The CH-46 features a fixed [[tricycle landing gear]], complete with twin wheels on all three legs of the landing gear; this configuration results in a nose-up stance, helping to facilitate cargo loading and unloading. Two of the main landing gear were installed within protruding rear [[sponson]]s; the free interior space of the sponsons are also used to house fuel tanks, possessing a total capacity of 350 US gallons (1,438 L).<ref name=\"vect_CH-46\"/>\n\nThe interior of the CH-46 was largely taken up by its cargo bay, complete with a rear loading ramp that could be removed or left open in flight for the carriage of extended cargoes or for parachute drops. Various furnishings were normally provided to aid in its use as a utility rotorcraft, such as an internal [[winch]] mounted within the forward cabin, which can be used to assisting loading by pulling external cargo on [[pallet]]s into the aircraft via the ramp and rollers, and an optionally-attached belly-mounted [[Cargo hook (helicopter)|cargo hook]], which would be usually rated at {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} for carrying cargoes externally underneath the Sea Knight; despite the hook having been rated at {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}}, this was safety restricted to less payload as they got older. When operated in a typical configuration, the CH-46 would usually be operated by a crew of three; a larger crew could be accommodated when required, which would be dependent upon mission specifics.

CH-46 operations were plagued by major technical problems; the engines, being prone to [[foreign object damage]] (FOD) from debris being ingested when hovering close to the ground and subsequently suffering a [[compressor stall]], had a lifespan as low as 85 flight hours; on 21 July 1966, all CH-46s were grounded until more efficient filters had been fitted.<ref>Dunstan 2003, pp. 182\u2013184.</ref>\n\nOn 3 May 1967, a CH-46D at [[Marine Corps Air Station Tustin|Marine Corps Air Facility Santa Ana]] crashed, killing all four members of the crew. Within three days the accident investigators had determined that the mounting brackets of the main transmission had failed, allowing the front and rear overlapping rotors to intermesh. All CH\u201346s were temporarily grounded for inspection. On 13 May, a CH\u201346A crashed off the coast of Vietnam when the tail pylon containing the engines, main transmission and aft rotors broke off in flight. All four crew members were killed. On 20 June, another CH\u201346A crashed, though two of the four-man crew survived. Once again, even though the aircraft was not recovered from the water, failure of some sort in the rear pylon was suspected. On 30 June a CH-46D at Santa Ana crashed when a rotor blade separated from the aircraft, all three of the crew survived. As a result of this latest accident, all CH-46Ds were immediately grounded, but the CH-46As continued flying. On 3 July another CH-46A crashed in Vietnam, killing all four Marines of its crew.

The International Organization for Standardization (IOS) is an independent, non-governmental organization, the members of which are the standards organizations of the 164 member countries.<ref name=\"ISO_members\" /> It is the world's largest developer of voluntary international standards and it facilitates world trade by providing common standards among nations. More than twenty thousand standards have been set, covering everything from manufactured products and technology to food safety, agriculture, and healthcare.<ref name=\"About_ISO\"/>\n\nUse of the standards aids in the creation of products and services that are safe, reliable, and of good quality. The standards help businesses increase productivity while minimizing errors and waste. By enabling products from different markets to be directly compared, they facilitate companies in entering new markets and assist in the development of global trade on a fair basis. The standards also serve to safeguard consumers and the end-users of products and services, ensuring that certified products conform to the minimum standards set internationally.<ref name=\"About_ISO\"/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Memory plaque of founding ISA in Prague cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Plaque marking the building in [[Prague]] where the ISO predecessor, the ISA, was founded]]\nThe organization today known as ISO, began in the 1920s as the International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations (ISA).

In October 1946, ISA and UNSCC delegates from 25 countries met in London and agreed to join forces to create the new International Organization for Standardization. The new organization officially began operations in February 1947.<ref name=\"50_years\">{{citation |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/2012_friendship_among_equals.pdf |format=PDF |title=Friendship among equals \u2013 Recollections from ISO's first fifty years |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |year=1997 |isbn=92-67-10260-5 |pages=15\u201318 |url-status=live |archivedate=26 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026060448/http://www.iso.org/iso/2012_friendship_among_equals.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Language use==\nThe three official languages of the ISO are [[English language|English]] (with [[Oxford spelling]]), [[French language|French]], and [[Russian language|Russian]].<ref name=\"languages\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/how_to_use_the_catalogue.htm |title=How to use the ISO Catalogue |publisher=ISO.org |url-status=dead |archivedate=4 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004225623/http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/how_to_use_the_catalogue.htm}}</ref>\n\n== Name and abbreviations ==\nThe name of the organization in French is ''{{lang|fr|Organisation internationale de normalisation}}'', and in Russian, {{lang|ru|\u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438}} (''{{transl|ru|Mezhdunarodnaya organizatsiya po standartizatsii}}'').

''IEC'' for ''[[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'' is included if the standard results from the work of ISO/IEC JTC1 (the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee). ''ASTM'' (American Society for Testing and Materials) is used for standards developed in cooperation with [[ASTM International]]. ''yyyy'' and ''IS'' are not used for an incomplete or unpublished standard and, under some circumstances, may be left off the title of a published work.\n\n'''Technical reports'''\n: These are issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has collected data of a different kind from that normally published as an International Standard,<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> such as references and explanations. The naming conventions for these are the same as for standards, except ''TR'' prepended instead of ''IS'' in the report's name.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/IEC TR 17799:2000 Code of Practice for Information Security Management\n* ISO/TR 19033:2000 Technical product documentation \u2014 Metadata for construction documentation\n\n'''Technical and publicly available specifications'''\n: Technical specifications may be produced when \"the subject in question is still under development or where for any other reason there is the future but not immediate possibility of an agreement to publish an International Standard\". A publicly available specification is usually \"an intermediate specification, published prior to the development of a full International Standard, or, in IEC may be a 'dual logo' publication published in collaboration with an external organization\".<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> By convention, both types of specification are named in a manner similar to the organization's technical reports.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 Technical product documentation \u2014 Reference designation system \u2014 Part 1: General application rules\n* ISO/PAS 11154:2006 Road vehicles \u2014 Roof load carriers\n\n'''Technical corrigenda'''\n: ISO also sometimes issues \"technical corrigenda\" (where \"corrigenda\" is the plural of [[Erratum|corrigendum]]). These are amendments made to existing standards due to minor technical flaws, usability improvements, or limited-applicability extensions. They are generally issued with the expectation that the affected standard will be updated or withdrawn at its next scheduled review.<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/>\n\n'''ISO guides'''\n:These are meta-standards covering \"matters related to international standardization\".<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> They are named using the format ''\"ISO[/IEC] Guide N:yyyy: Title\"''.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/IEC Guide 2:2004 Standardization and related activities \u2014 General vocabulary\n* ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996 General requirements for bodies operating product certification\n\n===Document copyright===\nISO documents are copyright and ISO charges for most copies. It does not, however, charge for most draft copies of documents in electronic format. Although they are useful, care must be taken using these drafts as there is the possibility of substantial change before they become finalized as standards.

ISO/IEC directives also allow the so-called \"Fast-track procedure\". In this procedure a document is submitted directly for approval as a draft International Standard (DIS) to the ISO member bodies or as a final draft International Standard (FDIS), if the document was developed by an international standardizing body recognized by the ISO Council.<ref name=\"iso-stages\"/>\n\nThe first step\u2014a proposal of work (New Proposal) is approved at the relevant subcommittee or technical committee (e.g.,&nbsp;SC29 and JTC1 respectively in the case of [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] \u2013 ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11). A working group (WG) of experts is set up by the TC/SC for the preparation of a working draft. When the scope of a new work is sufficiently clarified, some of the working groups (e.g.,&nbsp;MPEG) usually make open request for proposals\u2014known as a \"call for proposals\". The first document that is produced, for example, for audio and video coding standards is called a verification model&nbsp;(VM) (previously also called a \"simulation and test model\"). When a sufficient confidence in the stability of the standard under development is reached, a working draft&nbsp;(WD) is produced. This is in the form of a standard, but is kept internal to working group for revision. When a working draft is sufficiently solid and the working group is satisfied that it has developed the best technical solution to the problem being addressed, it becomes a committee draft&nbsp;(CD). If it is required, it is then sent to the P-members of the TC/SC (national bodies) for ballot.\n\nThe committee draft becomes final committee draft (FCD) if the number of positive votes exceeds the quorum. Successive committee drafts may be considered until consensus is reached on the technical content. When consensus is reached, the text is finalized for submission as a draft International Standard (DIS). Then the text is submitted to national bodies for voting and comment within a period of five months. It is approved for submission as a final draft International Standard&nbsp;(FDIS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC are in favour and if not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. ISO will then hold a ballot with National Bodies where no technical changes are allowed (yes/no ballot), within a period of two months. It is approved as an International Standard&nbsp;(IS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC is in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. After approval, only minor editorial changes are introduced into the final text.

Some examples of this are:\n* [[Disk images]] end in the [[file extension]] \"[[ISO image|ISO]]\" to signify that they are using the [[ISO&nbsp;9660]] standard file system as opposed to another file system\u2014hence Discs&nbsp;images commonly are referred to as \"ISOs\".\n* The sensitivity of a photographic film to light (its \"[[film speed]]\") is described by [[ISO&nbsp;6]], [[ISO&nbsp;2240]] and [[ISO&nbsp;5800]]. Hence, the speed of the film often is referred to by its ISO&nbsp;number.\n* As it was originally defined in ISO&nbsp;518, the flash [[hot shoe]] found on cameras often is called the \"ISO&nbsp;shoe\".\n* [[ISO 11783]], which is marketed as ISOBUS.\n* [[ISO 13216]], which is marketed as ISOFIX.\n\n== Criticism and laments ==\n\nWith the exception of a small number of isolated standards,<ref name=\"FreelyAvailableStandards\"/> normally ISO standards are not available free of charge, but for a purchase fee,<ref name=\"iso_shopFAQ\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm |title=Shopping FAQs |publisher=ISO |url-status=live |archivedate=5 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005054552/http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm}}</ref> which has been seen by some as unaffordable by small [[Open-source model|open source]] projects.<ref name=\"oreilly2007\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html |title=Where to get ISO Standards on the Internet free |publisher=oreillynet.com |last=Jelliffe |first=Rick |quote=The lack of free online availability has effectively made ISO standard irrelevant to the (home/hacker section of the) Open Source community. |date=1 August 2007 |url-status=live |archivedate=24 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124060422/http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ISO/IEC JTC1]] fast-track procedures (\"Fast-track\" as used by [[Office Open XML|OOXML]] and \"PAS\" as used by [[OpenDocument]]) have garnered criticism in relation to the [[standardization of Office Open XML]] (ISO/IEC&nbsp;29500). Martin Bryan, outgoing convenor of [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34]] WG1, is quoted as saying:<ref name=\"jtc1_sc34_0940\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm |title=Report on WG1 activity for December 2007 Meeting of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG1 in Kyoto |publisher=iso/jtc1 sc34 |url-status=live |archivedate=12 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812081252/http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nI would recommend my successor that it is perhaps time to pass WG1\u2019s outstanding standards over to OASIS, where they can get approval in less than a year and then do a PAS submission to ISO, which will get a lot more attention and be approved much faster than standards currently can be within WG1.\n\nThe disparity of rules for PAS, Fast-Track and ISO committee generated standards is fast making ISO a laughing stock in IT circles. The days of open standards development are fast disappearing. Instead we are getting \"standardization by corporation\".\n</blockquote>\n\nThe computer security entrepreneur and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] founder, [[Mark Shuttleworth]], commented on the [[Standardization of Office Open XML]] process by saying: \"I think it de-values the confidence people have in the standards setting process\", and alleged that ISO did not carry out its responsibility. He also noted that [[Microsoft]] had intensely lobbied many countries that traditionally had not participated in ISO and stacked technical committees with Microsoft employees, solution providers, and resellers sympathetic to Office Open XML:<ref name=\"zdnet_2222\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222 |title=Ubuntu's Shuttleworth blames ISO for OOXML's win |publisher=ZDNet.com |date=1 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archivedate=4 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404052723/http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nWhen you have a process built on trust and when that trust is abused, ISO should halt the process...

More than twenty thousand standards have been set, covering everything from manufactured products and technology to food safety, agriculture, and healthcare.<ref name=\"About_ISO\"/>\n\nUse of the standards aids in the creation of products and services that are safe, reliable, and of good quality. The standards help businesses increase productivity while minimizing errors and waste. By enabling products from different markets to be directly compared, they facilitate companies in entering new markets and assist in the development of global trade on a fair basis. The standards also serve to safeguard consumers and the end-users of products and services, ensuring that certified products conform to the minimum standards set internationally.<ref name=\"About_ISO\"/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Memory plaque of founding ISA in Prague cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Plaque marking the building in [[Prague]] where the ISO predecessor, the ISA, was founded]]\nThe organization today known as ISO, began in the 1920s as the International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations (ISA).

''IEC'' for ''[[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'' is included if the standard results from the work of ISO/IEC JTC1 (the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee). ''ASTM'' (American Society for Testing and Materials) is used for standards developed in cooperation with [[ASTM International]]. ''yyyy'' and ''IS'' are not used for an incomplete or unpublished standard and, under some circumstances, may be left off the title of a published work.\n\n'''Technical reports'''\n: These are issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has collected data of a different kind from that normally published as an International Standard,<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> such as references and explanations.

A publicly available specification is usually \"an intermediate specification, published prior to the development of a full International Standard, or, in IEC may be a 'dual logo' publication published in collaboration with an external organization\".<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> By convention, both types of specification are named in a manner similar to the organization's technical reports.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 Technical product documentation \u2014 Reference designation system \u2014 Part 1: General application rules\n* ISO/PAS 11154:2006 Road vehicles \u2014 Roof load carriers\n\n'''Technical corrigenda'''\n: ISO also sometimes issues \"technical corrigenda\" (where \"corrigenda\" is the plural of [[Erratum|corrigendum]]). These are amendments made to existing standards due to minor technical flaws, usability improvements, or limited-applicability extensions. They are generally issued with the expectation that the affected standard will be updated or withdrawn at its next scheduled review.<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/>\n\n'''ISO guides'''\n:These are meta-standards covering \"matters related to international standardization\".<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> They are named using the format ''\"ISO[/IEC] Guide N:yyyy: Title\"''.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/IEC Guide 2:2004 Standardization and related activities \u2014 General vocabulary\n* ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996 General requirements for bodies operating product certification\n\n===Document copyright===\nISO documents are copyright and ISO charges for most copies. It does not, however, charge for most draft copies of documents in electronic format. Although they are useful, care must be taken using these drafts as there is the possibility of substantial change before they become finalized as standards. Some standards by ISO and its official U.S. representative (and, via the U.S. National Committee, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]]) are made freely available.<ref name=\"FreelyAvailableStandards\">{{cite web |title=Freely Available Standards |publisher=ISO |date=1 February 2011 |url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/ }}</ref><ref name=\"free_ansi\">{{cite web |title=Free ANSI Standards |url=http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/free_standards.asp |url-status=dead |archivedate=3 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403014457/http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/free_standards.asp}}</ref>\n\n== Standardization process ==\nA standard published by ISO/IEC is the last stage of a long process that commonly starts with the proposal of new work within a committee.

ISO/IEC directives also allow the so-called \"Fast-track procedure\". In this procedure a document is submitted directly for approval as a draft International Standard (DIS) to the ISO member bodies or as a final draft International Standard (FDIS), if the document was developed by an international standardizing body recognized by the ISO Council.<ref name=\"iso-stages\"/>\n\nThe first step\u2014a proposal of work (New Proposal) is approved at the relevant subcommittee or technical committee (e.g.,&nbsp;SC29 and JTC1 respectively in the case of [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] \u2013 ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11). A working group (WG) of experts is set up by the TC/SC for the preparation of a working draft. When the scope of a new work is sufficiently clarified, some of the working groups (e.g.,&nbsp;MPEG) usually make open request for proposals\u2014known as a \"call for proposals\". The first document that is produced, for example, for audio and video coding standards is called a verification model&nbsp;(VM) (previously also called a \"simulation and test model\"). When a sufficient confidence in the stability of the standard under development is reached, a working draft&nbsp;(WD) is produced. This is in the form of a standard, but is kept internal to working group for revision. When a working draft is sufficiently solid and the working group is satisfied that it has developed the best technical solution to the problem being addressed, it becomes a committee draft&nbsp;(CD). If it is required, it is then sent to the P-members of the TC/SC (national bodies) for ballot.\n\nThe committee draft becomes final committee draft (FCD) if the number of positive votes exceeds the quorum. Successive committee drafts may be considered until consensus is reached on the technical content. When consensus is reached, the text is finalized for submission as a draft International Standard (DIS). Then the text is submitted to national bodies for voting and comment within a period of five months. It is approved for submission as a final draft International Standard&nbsp;(FDIS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC are in favour and if not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. ISO will then hold a ballot with National Bodies where no technical changes are allowed (yes/no ballot), within a period of two months. It is approved as an International Standard&nbsp;(IS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC is in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. After approval, only minor editorial changes are introduced into the final text. The final text is sent to the ISO central secretariat, which publishes it as the International Standard.<ref name=\"about-mpeg\"/><ref name=\"iso-stages\"/>\n\n== Products named after ISO ==\n\nOn occasion, the fact that many of the ISO-created standards are ubiquitous, has led to common use of \"ISO\" to describe the product that conforms to a standard. Some examples of this are:\n* [[Disk images]] end in the [[file extension]] \"[[ISO image|ISO]]\" to signify that they are using the [[ISO&nbsp;9660]] standard file system as opposed to another file system\u2014hence Discs&nbsp;images commonly are referred to as \"ISOs\".\n* The sensitivity of a photographic film to light (its \"[[film speed]]\") is described by [[ISO&nbsp;6]], [[ISO&nbsp;2240]] and [[ISO&nbsp;5800]]. Hence, the speed of the film often is referred to by its ISO&nbsp;number.\n* As it was originally defined in ISO&nbsp;518, the flash [[hot shoe]] found on cameras often is called the \"ISO&nbsp;shoe\".\n* [[ISO 11783]], which is marketed as ISOBUS.\n* [[ISO 13216]], which is marketed as ISOFIX.\n\n== Criticism and laments ==\n\nWith the exception of a small number of isolated standards,<ref name=\"FreelyAvailableStandards\"/> normally ISO standards are not available free of charge, but for a purchase fee,<ref name=\"iso_shopFAQ\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm |title=Shopping FAQs |publisher=ISO |url-status=live |archivedate=5 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005054552/http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm}}</ref> which has been seen by some as unaffordable by small [[Open-source model|open source]] projects.<ref name=\"oreilly2007\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html |title=Where to get ISO Standards on the Internet free |publisher=oreillynet.com |last=Jelliffe |first=Rick |quote=The lack of free online availability has effectively made ISO standard irrelevant to the (home/hacker section of the) Open Source community. |date=1 August 2007 |url-status=live |archivedate=24 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124060422/http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ISO/IEC JTC1]] fast-track procedures (\"Fast-track\" as used by [[Office Open XML|OOXML]] and \"PAS\" as used by [[OpenDocument]]) have garnered criticism in relation to the [[standardization of Office Open XML]] (ISO/IEC&nbsp;29500). Martin Bryan, outgoing convenor of [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34]] WG1, is quoted as saying:<ref name=\"jtc1_sc34_0940\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm |title=Report on WG1 activity for December 2007 Meeting of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG1 in Kyoto |publisher=iso/jtc1 sc34 |url-status=live |archivedate=12 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812081252/http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nI would recommend my successor that it is perhaps time to pass WG1\u2019s outstanding standards over to OASIS, where they can get approval in less than a year and then do a PAS submission to ISO, which will get a lot more attention and be approved much faster than standards currently can be within WG1.\n\nThe disparity of rules for PAS, Fast-Track and ISO committee generated standards is fast making ISO a laughing stock in IT circles. The days of open standards development are fast disappearing. Instead we are getting \"standardization by corporation\".\n</blockquote>\n\nThe computer security entrepreneur and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] founder, [[Mark Shuttleworth]], commented on the [[Standardization of Office Open XML]] process by saying: \"I think it de-values the confidence people have in the standards setting process\", and alleged that ISO did not carry out its responsibility. He also noted that [[Microsoft]] had intensely lobbied many countries that traditionally had not participated in ISO and stacked technical committees with Microsoft employees, solution providers, and resellers sympathetic to Office Open XML:<ref name=\"zdnet_2222\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222 |title=Ubuntu's Shuttleworth blames ISO for OOXML's win |publisher=ZDNet.com |date=1 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archivedate=4 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404052723/http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nWhen you have a process built on trust and when that trust is abused, ISO should halt the process...
