For a brief period around 1944\u20131946, he also taught English literature at [[Meerut College]].<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p. 26</ref> For years, he struggled to find a permanent job in Delhi, and as per his brother that might have pushed him to move to the newly forme state of [[Pakistan]]<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p. 31</ref> but the decisive factor was the civil strife and riots which followed the Partition, and in October 1947, he reached [[Lahore]] all alone, asking his mother and siblings to also abandon [[Meerut]].<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p. 34</ref> That's where he acquired a more cultural approach of Urdu literature, which would represent the Islamic identity of his new country, whereas his \"idea of Pakistan was influenced by a European/French model of democracy, where social and economic justice would go hand in hand with the nurturing of cultural traditions in which the individuals, especially those of the intelligentsia such as poets and writers, could be loyal to the state and society, yet free of governmental pressure and perform the duties of informed, perceptive critics and citizens.\"<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p. 35</ref><ref name=Dawn/>     \n\nIn February 1950, he moved to [[Karachi]] to work as editor for a government journal, and even if it didn't last more than few months, he didn't return to Lahore considering he got a job as English teacher in the Islamia College. With friends as colleagues like [[Karrar Hussain]], he'll remain there until his death in January 1978.<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), pp. 37\u201338</ref>     \n\nHe died on 18 January 1978, due to a \"massive heart attack\", at the age of 57, and was buried in the [[Darul uloom|Darul Ulum]] cemetery of Karachi, next to Mufti [[Muhammad Shafi]], whose [[tafsir|Qur'anic commentary]], [[Maariful Quran|Ma'ariful Qu'ran]], he was translating into English during his last days,<ref>Maulana Mufti Muhammad Shafi, ''Ma'ariful Qur'an'', Maktaba-eDarul-'Uloom, volume 1, p. viii</ref> the [[Salat al-Janazah|funeral prayer]] being led by the latter's son, Mufti [[Muhammad Taqi Usmani]].<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), pp. 44\u201345</ref>    \n\nAfter his death, his personal library was donated to the [[Abdul-Q\u0101dir Bedil|Bedil]] Library, located in [[Sharfabad Society|Sharfabad]], Karachi.<ref>{{cite web|author=Peerzada Salman|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1195556/a-relatively-unknown-book-haven |title=A relatively unknown book haven|date=22 July 2015|publisher=Dawn|location=Pakistan|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Ideas and ideology==\n===From \"Westernized\" to \"cultural Islamist\"===\nAskari began his literary life as a short story writer in the mould of [[Anton Chekov]], and as an essayist influenced by the ideas of the [[Progressive Writers' Movement]], a [[Marxist]] movement conceptualized by [[Sajjad Zaheer]] aiming to transform society through literature.<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), pp. 76\u201377</ref> His early \"Westernization\" is noticeable by the fact that, contrarily to the contemporary Urdu writers, his favourite authors were not [[Nazir Ahmad Dehlvi|Maulvi Nazir Ahmad]] or [[Premchand]], but foreign authors like [[Flaubert]], Chekhov, [[\u00c9mile Zola]], [[James Joyce]], [[Rimbaud]] and \"especially [[Baudelaire]]\".<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p. 82</ref> In that regard, he wrote \"obscene\" short-stories, involving [[Anglo-Indians]] and [[homoeroticism]].<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), pp. 89\u201390</ref> \n\nHe would go on to write literature in that mood for years, but the [[Partition of India]] would bring issues like religion and identity, which would push him to adopt a more cultural approach to literature, and more specifically, an Islamic vision. While more or less a-political, he'd specifically turn [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] and even more so [[anti-American]].<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p. 107</ref>  \n\nThe best way to visualize this radical change is by reading a serie of essays, ''Jhalkiyan'', put together by Suhayl Umar and Naghma Umar, chronologically : in the Pre-Partition period, he treats mainly of literature and art, with figures such as [[Ezra Pound]], [[Andre Gide]], [[Akbar Allahabadi]], [[Firaq Gorakhpuri]], [[Chaucer]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Voltaire]], [[D.H. Lawrence]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Rodin]] or [[Jacob Epstein]]. He also wrote on the literary movement known as the [[New Apocalyptics]]. After Partition, his essays become more ideological, and centred around the idea of Urdu as the Islamic cultural cement of the newly founded state of Pakistan. During this period, he also rejets Progressives' ideas about literature, that he embraced years ago. The 1200-odd pages collection of essays also show that during his last years he became disillusioned with Pakistan, thinking it didn't led to the cultural renaissance centred around Urdu he expected, even if he kept his strong opinions about religion, philosophy and politics.<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), pp. 108\u2013145</ref> As some sort of conclusion to the lack of some Islamic national literature, he declared \"the death of [[Urdu literature]]\" in 1953\u20131955.<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p. 217</ref>\n   \n===Aesthetics===\nWith the philosophy of [[Heidegger]] and the poetry of [[Holderlin]] as well as [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9|Mallarm\u00e9]], but more specifically influenced by the idea of [[Sufi metaphysics|wahdat al wujud]] (unicity of Existence) found among Islamic philosophers, Askari sought a poetry which would be unveil the \"being\" of the individual, and was thus critical of the overtly romantic and emotional outbursts of many of his contemporaries and of classics.<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), pp. 158\u2013162</ref> He blamed the absorption of [[Western philosophy]] and thinking by Indian Muslims for downgrading poetry to sentimentalism, and wanted to go back to the Islamic sources and Sufi aesthetics, congratulating the works of the [[Deobandi]] scholar Maulana [[Ashraf Ali Thanwi]] on the Qur'an and [[Rumi]] as representative of this brand of poetics.<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the

For a brief period around 1944\u20131946, he also taught English literature at [[Meerut College]].<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p. 26</ref> For years, he struggled to find a permanent job in Delhi, and as per his brother that might have pushed him to move to the newly forme state of [[Pakistan]]<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p. 31</ref> but the decisive factor was the civil strife and riots which followed the Partition, and in October 1947, he reached [[Lahore]] all alone, asking his mother and siblings to also abandon [[Meerut]].<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p. 34</ref> That's where he acquired a more cultural approach of Urdu literature, which would represent the Islamic identity of his new country, whereas his \"idea of Pakistan was influenced by a European/French model of democracy, where social and economic justice would go hand in hand with the nurturing of cultural traditions in which the individuals, especially those of the intelligentsia such as poets and writers, could be loyal to the state and society, yet free of governmental pressure and perform the duties of informed, perceptive critics and citizens.\"<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p. 35</ref><ref name=Dawn/>     \n\nIn February 1950, he moved to [[Karachi]] to work as editor for a government journal, and even if it didn't last more than few months, he didn't return to Lahore considering he got a job as English teacher in the Islamia College. With friends as colleagues like [[Karrar Hussain]], he'll remain there until his death in January 1978.<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), pp. 37\u201338</ref>     \n\nHe died on 18 January 1978, due to a \"massive heart attack\", at the age of 57, and was buried in the [[Darul uloom|Darul Ulum]] cemetery of Karachi, next to Mufti [[Muhammad Shafi]], whose [[tafsir|Qur'anic commentary]], [[Maariful Quran|Ma'ariful Qu'ran]], he was translating into English during his last days,<ref>Maulana Mufti Muhammad Shafi, ''Ma'ariful Qur'an'', Maktaba-eDarul-'Uloom, volume 1, p. viii</ref> the [[Salat al-Janazah|funeral prayer]] being led by the latter's son, Mufti [[Muhammad Taqi Usmani]].<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), pp. 44\u201345</ref>    \n\nAfter his death, his personal library was donated to the [[Abdul-Q\u0101dir Bedil|Bedil]] Library, located in [[Sharfabad Society|Sharfabad]], Karachi.<ref>{{cite web|author=Peerzada Salman|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1195556/a-relatively-unknown-book-haven |title=A relatively unknown book haven|date=22 July 2015|publisher=Dawn|location=Pakistan|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Ideas and ideology==\n===From \"Westernized\" to \"cultural Islamist\"===\nAskari began his literary life as a short story writer in the mould of [[Anton Chekov]], and as an essayist influenced by the ideas of the [[Progressive Writers' Movement]], a [[Marxist]] movement conceptualized by [[Sajjad Zaheer]] aiming to transform society through literature.<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), pp. 76\u201377</ref> His early \"Westernization\" is noticeable by the fact that, contrarily to the contemporary Urdu writers, his favourite authors were not [[Nazir Ahmad Dehlvi|Maulvi Nazir Ahmad]] or [[Premchand]], but foreign authors like [[Flaubert]], Chekhov, [[\u00c9mile Zola]], [[James Joyce]], [[Rimbaud]] and \"especially [[Baudelaire]]\".<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p. 82</ref> In that regard, he wrote \"obscene\" short-stories, involving [[Anglo-Indians]] and [[homoeroticism]].<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), pp. 89\u201390</ref> \n\nHe would go on to write literature in that mood for years, but the [[Partition of India]] would bring issues like religion and identity, which would push him to adopt a more cultural approach to literature, and more specifically, an Islamic vision. While more or less a-political, he'd specifically turn [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] and even more so [[anti-American]].<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p. 107</ref>  \n\nThe best way to visualize this radical change is by reading a serie of essays, ''Jhalkiyan'', put together by Suhayl Umar and Naghma Umar, chronologically : in the Pre-Partition period, he treats mainly of literature and art, with figures such as [[Ezra Pound]], [[Andre Gide]], [[Akbar Allahabadi]], [[Firaq Gorakhpuri]], [[Chaucer]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Voltaire]], [[D.H. Lawrence]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Rodin]] or [[Jacob Epstein]]. He also wrote on the literary movement known as the [[New Apocalyptics]]. After Partition, his essays become more ideological, and centred around the idea of Urdu as the Islamic cultural cement of the newly founded state of Pakistan. During this period, he also rejets Progressives' ideas about literature, that he embraced years ago. The 1200-odd pages collection of essays also show that during his last years he became disillusioned with Pakistan, thinking it didn't led to the cultural renaissance centred around Urdu he expected, even if he kept his strong opinions about religion, philosophy and politics.<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), pp. 108\u2013145</ref> As some sort of conclusion to the lack of some Islamic national literature, he declared \"the death of [[Urdu literature]]\" in 1953\u20131955.<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p. 217</ref>\n   \n===Aesthetics===\nWith the philosophy of [[Heidegger]] and the poetry of [[Holderlin]] as well as [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9|Mallarm\u00e9]], but more specifically influenced by the idea of [[Sufi metaphysics|wahdat al wujud]] (unicity of Existence) found among Islamic philosophers, Askari sought a poetry which would be unveil the \"being\" of the individual, and was thus critical of the overtly romantic and emotional outbursts of many of his contemporaries and of classics.<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), pp. 158\u2013162</ref> He blamed the absorption of [[Western philosophy]] and thinking by Indian Muslims for downgrading poetry to sentimentalism, and wanted to go back to the Islamic sources and Sufi aesthetics, congratulating the works of the [[Deobandi]] scholar Maulana [[Ashraf Ali Thanwi]] on the Qur'an and [[Rumi]] as representative of this brand of poetics.<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p. 180</ref>   \n\nHis aesthetics were thus another emanation of his ideology and politics.\n\n===Politics===\nPolitically, he has been described as proposing some sort of [[Islamic socialism]], a \"self-sufficient Pakistan where Muslims would lead a life enriched with principles of democracy\", and was in favour of [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and naturally a harsh critic of [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]].<ref>Mehr Afshan Farooqi, ''Urdu Literary Culture: Vernacular Modernity in the Writing of Muhammad Hasan Askari'', Springer (2012), p.
