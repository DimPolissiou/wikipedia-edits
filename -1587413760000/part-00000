During the early 1908s, the founders onboarded [[Howard Schultz]] as their directer of retail operations and marketing. Schultz, after visiting [[Milan|Milan, Italy]], opened a specialty cafe that merged with Starbucks in the late-1980s. His first tenure as chief executive, from 1986 to 2000, led to an aggressive expansion of the franchise, first in Seattle, then across the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. Despite an initial economic downturn with its expansion into the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[British Columbia]], the company experienced revitalized prosperity with its entry into [[California]] in the early 1990s through a series of highly-publicized [[coffee wars]]. Schultz was succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]] who ran the company for five years who positioned Starbucks as a large player in [[fair trade]] coffee and grew sales to $5 billion. [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]], served as chief executive from 2005 to 2008, orchestrating a large-scale [[earnings]] expansion. Schultz returned as CEO in the middle of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]]. Starbucks spent the succeeding decade growing its market share, expanding its offerings, and reorienting itself around [[corporate social responsibility]]. [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] took over from Schultz in 2017, and continues to serve as the firm's chief executive.\n\nMany stores sell pre-packaged food items, hot and cold sandwiches, and drinkware including mugs and [[Whiskey tumbler|tumblers]]; select \"Starbucks Evenings\" locations offer [[beer]], [[wine]], and appetizers. Starbucks-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled cold coffee drinks are also sold at [[grocery stores]]. In 2010, the company began its [[Starbucks Reserve]] program for single-origin coffees and high-end coffee shops. Starbucks operates six roasteries with tasting rooms and 43 coffee bars as part of the program. In November 2019, the world's largest Starbucks opened in [[Chicago]] on the [[Magnificent Mile]] as the sixth roastery location. Starbucks has received [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant and sustained criticism]] about its business practices, corporate affairs, and role in society. Conversely, its franchise has commanded substantial [[brand loyalty]], market share, and [[Valuation (finance)|company value]]. \n\n==History==\n[[File:Pike Place Market - Starbucks circa 1977A.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Pike Place Market]] location in 1977]]\n\n===Founding===\nThe first Starbucks was opened in Seattle, Washington, on March 31, 1971,<ref>Starbucks [http://www.starbucks.com/coffeehouse/store-design/1st-and-pike \"1st and Pike\"], \"Starbucks\", 2016</ref> by three partners who met while they were students at the [[University of San Francisco]]:<ref name=\"TimeOutSF\">{{cite book|author=Time Out|title=Time Out Guide San Francisco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esY90CkrXbYC|accessdate=April 9, 2013|year=2011|publisher=Time Out Guides|isbn=978-1-84670-220-4}}</ref> English teacher [[Jerry Baldwin]], history teacher [[Zev Siegl]], and writer [[Gordon Bowker]] were inspired to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment by coffee roasting entrepreneur [[Alfred Peet]] after he taught them his style of roasting beans.<ref name=Pren2523>Pendergrast, pp. 252\u201353</ref> Bowker recalls that Terry Heckler, with whom Bowker owned an advertising agency, thought words beginning with \"st\" were powerful.

In 2000, San Francisco [[cartoonist]] [[Kieron Dwyer]] was sued by Starbucks for copyright and trademark infringement after creating a parody of its siren logo and putting it on the cover of one of his comics, later placing it on coffee mugs, T-shirts, and stickers that he sold on his website and at comic book conventions. Dwyer felt that since his work was a parody it was protected by his right to [[free speech]] under U.S. law. The case was eventually settled [[Settlement (litigation)|out of court]], as Dwyer claimed he did not have the financial ability to endure a trial case with Starbucks. The judge agreed that Dwyer's work was a parody and thus enjoyed constitutional protection; however, he was forbidden from financially \"profiting\" from using a \"confusingly similar\" image of the Starbucks siren logo.

Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization when it is actually a for-profit brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date= |title= Stealing water day|url= http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2007-03-22/news_story4.php|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011110231/http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2007-03-22/news_story4.php|archivedate=October 11, 2007|magazine= NOW Toronto|quote= \"Maybe they're not trying to sell anything on World Water Day, but every other day of they year they are selling water.\" |publisher= |access-date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shareholder.com/visitors/dynamicdoc/document.cfm?CompanyID=SBUX&DocumentID=1382 |title=Starbucks Corporation 2006 Annual Report |publisher=Shareholder.com |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref> The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands.<ref>Walker, R.

During the early 1908s, the founders onboarded [[Howard Schultz]] as their directer of retail operations and marketing. Schultz, after visiting [[Milan|Milan, Italy]], opened a specialty cafe that merged with Starbucks in the late-1980s. His first tenure as chief executive, from 1986 to 2000, led to an aggressive expansion of the franchise, first in Seattle, then across the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. Despite an initial economic downturn with its expansion into the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[British Columbia]], the company experienced revitalized prosperity with its entry into [[California]] in the early 1990s through a series of highly-publicized [[coffee wars]]. Schultz was succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]] who ran the company for five years who positioned Starbucks as a large player in [[fair trade]] coffee and grew sales to $5 billion. [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]], served as chief executive from 2005 to 2008, orchestrating a large-scale [[earnings]] expansion. Schultz returned as CEO in the middle of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]]. Starbucks spent the succeeding decade growing its market share, expanding its offerings, and reorienting itself around [[corporate social responsibility]]. [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] took over from Schultz in 2017, and continues to serve as the firm's chief executive.\n\nMany stores sell pre-packaged food items, hot and cold sandwiches, and drinkware including mugs and [[Whiskey tumbler|tumblers]]; select \"Starbucks Evenings\" locations offer [[beer]], [[wine]], and appetizers. Starbucks-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled cold coffee drinks are also sold at [[grocery stores]]. In 2010, the company began its [[Starbucks Reserve]] program for single-origin coffees and high-end coffee shops. Starbucks operates six roasteries with tasting rooms and 43 coffee bars as part of the program. In November 2019, the world's largest Starbucks opened in [[Chicago]] on the [[Magnificent Mile]] as the sixth roastery location. Starbucks has received [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant and sustained criticism]] about its business practices, corporate affairs, and role in society.

He had been convicted of the murders of three boys in [[Maine]] and Nebraska.\n\n==Childhood==\nJoubert's parents [[divorce]]d when he was six years old, and he went to live with his mother in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]]. He was not allowed to visit his father and grew to hate his controlling mother. In 1974, she moved the family to [[Portland, Maine]]. He attended [[Cheverus High School]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Maine authorities want to interview Joubert in Nebraska |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5dA8AAAAIBAJ&sjid=Jy4MAAAAIBAJ&pg=3678,1755520&dq=john+joubert+cheverus&hl=en |accessdate=April 1, 2020 |work=Bangor Daily News |date=October 19, 1984 |via=[[Google News Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nWhen he was 13, he stabbed a young girl with a pencil and felt [[sexual arousal|sexually stimulated]] when she cried in pain. The next day, he took a razor blade and slashed another girl as he biked past her. He was never caught for either attack. In another incident, he beat and nearly strangled another boy. He relished the power of [[bullying]], and began to stab or slash others.\n\n==Murders==\nIn the city of [[Portland, Maine]], on August 22, 1982, 11-year-old Richard \"Ricky\" Stetson had gone [[jogging]]. When he had not returned by dark, his parents called the police. The next day, a motorist saw the boy's body on the side of the [[Interstate 295 (Maine)|I-295]]. It appeared that an attempt had been made to undress him, and he was stabbed and strangled. A suspect was arrested for the murder, but his teeth did not match a bite mark on Stetson's body, so he was released after a year and a half in custody. No additional leads were presented until January 1984.\n\nDanny Joe Eberle disappeared while delivering the ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'' newspaper on Sunday, September 18, 1983, in [[Bellevue, Nebraska]]. His brother, who also delivered the newspaper, had not seen him, but did remember being followed by a white man in a tan car on previous days. It was found that Eberle had delivered just three of the 70 newspapers on his route. At his fourth delivery, his bicycle was discovered along with the rest of the newspapers. There appeared to be no sign of a struggle. Joubert would later describe how he had approached Eberle, drew a knife and then covered the boy's mouth with his hand. He then instructed the boy to follow him and took him to his truck. He then took him to a gravel road outside of town.\n\nAfter a three-day search, his body was finally discovered about four miles (6&nbsp;km) from where his bike had been found. He had been stripped to his underwear, had his feet and hands bound and mouth taped with [[surgical tape]]. He had been stabbed nine times. As a kidnapping, the crime came under the jurisdiction of the [[federal government of the United States]], so the [[FBI]] was called in.\n\nThe investigation followed several leads, including a young man who was arrested for [[child sexual abuse|molesting]] two young boys about a week after the crime. He failed a [[polygraph]] test and had a false [[Wiktionary:alibi|alibi]] but did not fit the [[offender profiling|profile]] the FBI had created for the murderer. He was released due to a lack of evidence. Other known [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]] in the area were also questioned, but the case went cold due to a scarcity of evidence.\n\nOn December 2, Christopher Walden disappeared in [[Papillion, Nebraska]], about three miles (five km) from where Eberle's body was found. Witnesses again said they saw a white man in a tan car. Joubert said that he had driven up to Walden as he walked, showed him the sheath of his knife and ordered him into the car. After driving to some railways lines out of town, he ordered Walden to strip to his underwear, which he did. But then Walden refused to lie down. After a brief struggle, Joubert overpowered and then stabbed him. Joubert cut Walden's throat, so deep that he had almost been [[Decapitation|decapitated]]. Walden's body was found two days later five miles (eight km) from the town. Although the crimes were similar there were differences. Walden had not been bound, had been concealed better, and was thought to have been killed immediately after being abducted.\n\n==Arrest==\nOn January 11, 1984, a preschool teacher in the area of the murders called police to say that she had seen a young man driving in the area.

Joubert''' (July 2, 1963 &ndash; July 17, 1996) was a [[serial killer]] [[death penalty|executed]] in [[Nebraska]]. He had been convicted of the murders of three boys in [[Maine]] and Nebraska.\n\n==Childhood==\nJoubert's parents [[divorce]]d when he was six years old, and he went to live with his mother in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]]. He was not allowed to visit his father and grew to hate his controlling mother. In 1974, she moved the family to [[Portland, Maine]]. He attended [[Cheverus High School]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Maine authorities want to interview Joubert in Nebraska |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5dA8AAAAIBAJ&sjid=Jy4MAAAAIBAJ&pg=3678,1755520&dq=john+joubert+cheverus&hl=en |accessdate=April 1, 2020 |work=Bangor Daily News |date=October 19, 1984 |via=[[Google News Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nWhen he was 13, he stabbed a young girl with a pencil and felt [[sexual arousal|sexually stimulated]] when she cried in pain. The next day, he took a razor blade and slashed another girl as he biked past her. He was never caught for either attack. In another incident, he beat and nearly strangled another boy. He relished the power of [[bullying]], and began to stab or slash others.\n\n==Murders==\nIn the city of [[Portland, Maine]], on August 22, 1982, 11-year-old Richard \"Ricky\" Stetson had gone [[jogging]]. When he had not returned by dark, his parents called the police. The next day, a motorist saw the boy's body on the side of the [[Interstate 295 (Maine)|I-295]]. It appeared that an attempt had been made to undress him, and he was stabbed and strangled. A suspect was arrested for the murder, but his teeth did not match a bite mark on Stetson's body, so he was released after a year and a half in custody. No additional leads were presented until January 1984.\n\nDanny Joe Eberle disappeared while delivering the ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'' newspaper on Sunday, September 18, 1983, in [[Bellevue, Nebraska]]. His brother, who also delivered the newspaper, had not seen him, but did remember being followed by a white man in a tan car on previous days. It was found that Eberle had delivered just three of the 70 newspapers on his route. At his fourth delivery, his bicycle was discovered along with the rest of the newspapers. There appeared to be no sign of a struggle. Joubert would later describe how he had approached Eberle, drew a knife and then covered the boy's mouth with his hand. He then instructed the boy to follow him and took him to his truck. He then took him to a gravel road outside of town.\n\nAfter a three-day search, his body was finally discovered about four miles (6&nbsp;km) from where his bike had been found. He had been stripped to his underwear, had his feet and hands bound and mouth taped with [[surgical tape]]. He had been stabbed nine times. As a kidnapping, the crime came under the jurisdiction of the [[federal government of the United States]], so the [[FBI]] was called in.\n\nThe investigation followed several leads, including a young man who was arrested for [[child sexual abuse|molesting]] two young boys about a week after the crime. He failed a [[polygraph]] test and had a false [[Wiktionary:alibi|alibi]] but did not fit the [[offender profiling|profile]] the FBI had created for the murderer. He was released due to a lack of evidence. Other known [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]] in the area were also questioned, but the case went cold due to a scarcity of evidence.\n\nOn December 2, Christopher Walden disappeared in [[Papillion, Nebraska]], about three miles (five km) from where Eberle's body was found. Witnesses again said they saw a white man in a tan car. Joubert said that he had driven up to Walden as he walked, showed him the sheath of his knife and ordered him into the car. After driving to some railways lines out of town, he ordered Walden to strip to his underwear, which he did. But then Walden refused to lie down. After a brief struggle, Joubert overpowered and then stabbed him. Joubert cut Walden's throat, so deep that he had almost been [[Decapitation|decapitated]]. Walden's body was found two days later five miles (eight km) from the town. Although the crimes were similar there were differences. Walden had not been bound, had been concealed better, and was thought to have been killed immediately after being abducted.\n\n==Arrest==\nOn January 11, 1984, a preschool teacher in the area of the murders called police to say that she had seen a young man driving in the area. There are conflicting stories as to what occurred \u2014 whether the car was loitering or just driving around. When the driver saw the teacher writing down his license plate, he stopped and threatened her before fleeing. The car was not tan, but was traced and found to be rented by John Joubert, an enlisted radar technician from [[Offutt Air Force Base]]. It turned out that his own car, a tan [[Chevrolet Nova|Nova sedan]], was being repaired.\n\nA [[search warrant]] was issued, and rope consistent with that used to bind Danny Joe Eberle was found in his dorm room.
