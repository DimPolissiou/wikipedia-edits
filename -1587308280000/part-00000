Children who experienced the death of a family member or a close friend or know someone with a chronic illness or parents have divorced have more frequent nightmares than those who are only faced with stress from school or stress from social aspects of daily life.<ref>Schredl, Michael, et al. \"Nightmares and Stress in Children.\" Sleep and Hypnosis 10.1 (2008): 19-25. ProQuest. Web. 29 Apr. 2014.</ref>\nA study researching the causes of nightmares focuses on patients who have [[sleep apnea]]. The study was conducted to determine whether or not nightmares may be caused by sleep apnea, or being unable to breathe. In the nineteenth century, authors believed that nightmares were caused by not having enough oxygen, therefore it was believed that those with sleep apnea had more frequent nightmares than those without it. The results actually showed that healthy people have more nightmares than the sleep apnea patients.<ref>Schredl, Michael, et al. \"Nightmares and Oxygen Desaturations: Is Sleep Apnea Related to Heightened Nightmare Frequency?\" Sleep and Breathing 10.4 (2006): 203-9.

In this study, 48 patients (aged 20\u201385 yrs) with obstructive airways disease (OAD), including 21 with and 27 without asthma, were compared with 149 sex- and age-matched controls without respiratory disease. OAD subjects with asthma reported approximately 3 times as many nightmares as controls or OAD subjects without asthma.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232572123 |title = Prevalence of nightmares among patients with asthma and chronic obstructive airways disease &#124; Request PDF}}</ref> The evolutionary purpose of nightmares then could be a mechanism to awaken a person who is in danger.\n\nLucid-dreaming advocate Stephen LaBerge has outlined a possible reason for how dreams are formulated and why nightmares occur with a high frequency. To LaBerge, a dream starts with an individual thought or scene, such as walking down a dimly lit street. Since dreams are not predetermined, the brain responds to the situation by either thinking a good thought or a bad thought, and the dream framework follows from there. Since the prominence of bad thoughts in dreams is higher than good,{{Explain|date=May 2019|reason=What is the evidence for bad thoughts being more frequent?}} the dream will proceed to be a nightmare.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming|last=Stephen|first=LaBerge|publisher=BALLANTINE BOOKS|year=1990|isbn=|location=New York|pages=65\u201366}}</ref>\n\nThere is a view, possibly featured in the story ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', that eating [[cheese]] before sleep can cause nightmares, but there is little scientific evidence for this phenomenon.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hammond |first=Claudia |date=17 April 2012 |title=Does cheese give you nightmares? |url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120417-does-cheese-give-you-nightmares |work=BBC |access-date=7 October 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\n[[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]] seemed to have shared a belief that people frequently distressed by nightmares could be re-experiencing some stressful event from the past.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coalson |first1=Bob |title=Nightmare help: Treatment of trauma survivors with PTSD. |journal=Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training |date=1995 |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=381\u2013388 |doi=10.1037/0033-3204.32.3.381 }}</ref> Both perspectives on dreams suggest that therapy can provide relief from the dilemma of the nightmarish experience.\n\nHalliday (1987), grouped treatment techniques into four classes.

Children who experienced the death of a family member or a close friend or know someone with a chronic illness have more frequent nightmares than those who are only faced with stress from school or stress from social aspects of daily life.<ref>Schredl, Michael, et al. \"Nightmares and Stress in Children.\" Sleep and Hypnosis 10.1 (2008): 19-25. ProQuest. Web. 29 Apr. 2014.</ref>\nA study researching the causes of nightmares focuses on patients who have [[sleep apnea]]. The study was conducted to determine whether or not nightmares may be caused by sleep apnea, or being unable to breathe. In the nineteenth century, authors believed that nightmares were caused by not having enough oxygen, therefore it was believed that those with sleep apnea had more frequent nightmares than those without it. The results actually showed that healthy people have more nightmares than the sleep apnea patients.<ref>Schredl, Michael, et al. \"Nightmares and Oxygen Desaturations: Is Sleep Apnea Related to Heightened Nightmare Frequency?\" Sleep and Breathing 10.4 (2006): 203-9.

In this study, 48 patients (aged 20\u201385 yrs) with obstructive airways disease (OAD), including 21 with and 27 without asthma, were compared with 149 sex- and age-matched controls without respiratory disease. OAD subjects with asthma reported approximately 3 times as many nightmares as controls or OAD subjects without asthma.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232572123 |title = Prevalence of nightmares among patients with asthma and chronic obstructive airways disease &#124; Request PDF}}</ref> The evolutionary purpose of nightmares then could be a mechanism to awaken a person who is in danger.\n\nLucid-dreaming advocate Stephen LaBerge has outlined a possible reason for how dreams are formulated and why nightmares occur with a high frequency. To LaBerge, a dream starts with an individual thought or scene, such as walking down a dimly lit street. Since dreams are not predetermined, the brain responds to the situation by either thinking a good thought or a bad thought, and the dream framework follows from there. Since the prominence of bad thoughts in dreams is higher than good,{{Explain|date=May 2019|reason=What is the evidence for bad thoughts being more frequent?}} the dream will proceed to be a nightmare.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming|last=Stephen|first=LaBerge|publisher=BALLANTINE BOOKS|year=1990|isbn=|location=New York|pages=65\u201366}}</ref>\n\nThere is a view, possibly featured in the story ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', that eating [[cheese]] before sleep can cause nightmares, but there is little scientific evidence for this phenomenon.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hammond |first=Claudia |date=17 April 2012 |title=Does cheese give you nightmares? |url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120417-does-cheese-give-you-nightmares |work=BBC |access-date=7 October 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\n[[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]] seemed to have shared a belief that people frequently distressed by nightmares could be re-experiencing some stressful event from the past.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coalson |first1=Bob |title=Nightmare help: Treatment of trauma survivors with PTSD. |journal=Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training |date=1995 |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=381\u2013388 |doi=10.1037/0033-3204.32.3.381 }}</ref> Both perspectives on dreams suggest that therapy can provide relief from the dilemma of the nightmarish experience.\n\nHalliday (1987), grouped treatment techniques into four classes.

The action was one of a series of operations conducted by the British [[Royal Navy]] and the [[French Navy]] to contest dominance over the Adriatic between 1807 and 1814. During this period the Adriatic was surrounded by French territory or French client states and as a result British interference was highly disruptive to the movement of French troops and supplies.\n\nThe action came over eight months after the British had achieved a decisive victory over the French at the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Lissa]] and was the first squadron action since that engagement. The action of November 1811 was the result of the British interception of a French military convoy traveling from [[Corfu]] to [[Trieste]] with a consignment of cannon, and resulted in a British victory, only one French ship escaping capture by the British force. It has been suggested that this action was a factor in [[Napoleon]]'s decision to change the direction of his planned eastwards expansion in 1812 from the Balkans [[French invasion of Russia|to Russia]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{details|Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814}}\nSince the [[War of the Third Coalition]], the French had maintained client kingdoms in [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] that controlled the western shores of the Adriatic. Over the next four years, strategically important islands and territories had been seized in the treaties of [[Treaty of Tilsit|Tilsit]] and [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn|Sch\u00f6nbrunn]], giving Napoleon direct command of the eastern shore.<ref name=\"JH111\">Henderson, p. 111</ref> With these treaties, France had seized not only several important fortress islands, most notably [[Corfu]], but also many important shipyards and harbours. Maintaining control of the Adriatic was however even harder than seizing it had been, the threat of attack by [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]], Russian or [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] armies and the mountainous terrain of the [[Balkans]] forcing the development of garrisons that could be effectively resupplied only by sea.<ref name=\"JH111\"/>\n\nThe Royal Navy, preeminent in the [[Mediterranean]] since the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805, sought to disrupt French convoys across the Adriatic. Following the Russian withdrawal in 1807, the Royal Navy dispatched a small frigate squadron to operate in the sea. The squadron was commanded by Captain [[William Hoste]], who seized the Illyrian island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]] (present-day Vis) to use as a base, waging a campaign against the French and their allies that forced the French Navy to deploy significantly larger forces to combat him.<ref name=\"JH112\">Henderson, p. 112</ref> This escalating series of raid and counter raid continued until March 1811, when the French commander in the Adriatic, [[Bernard Dubourdieu]] attacked Lissa with force twice that available to Hoste. In the ensuing battle Hoste not only routed his opponents, but captured two ships, sank another and killed Dubourdieu.<ref name=\"ODNBHoste\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13844 Hoste, Sir William], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[J. K. Laughton]], Retrieved 22 May 2008</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Lissa, the badly wounded Hoste returned to Britain in {{HMS|Amphion|1798|6}} leaving Captain [[James Brisbane]] in command in the Adriatic. Conflict in the theatre was widely dispersed, and so Brisbane delegated command to various commanders of small squadrons and independent cruisers.<ref name=\"ODNBMax\"/> These dispersed forces continued to have success against French convoys; on 27 November 1811, the independently sailing {{HMS|Eagle|1804|6}} foiled an attempt to send supplies to Corfu and captured the unarmed frigate {{ship|French frigate|Corceyre||2}}. The following day at 07:00, a message was received at [[Vis (town)|Port St. George]] on Lissa warning that another French convoy had been sighted close to the island.<ref name=\"WJ375\">James, p. 375</ref>\n\n==Chase==\nThe British commander on Lissa in November 1811 was Captain [[Murray Maxwell]] of {{HMS|Alceste|1806|6}} with two other frigates and a [[sloop-of-war|sloop]].<ref name=\"ODNBMax\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18408 Maxwell, Sir Murray], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', J. K. Laughton, Retrieved 23 May 2008</ref>  Maxwell responded to the signal by readying his squadron to seek out and destroy the convoy, but the attempted invasion of Lissa the previous March had bred caution in the British defenders and Maxwell was therefore compelled to disembark 30 sailors and most of his marines at [[Vis (town)|Port St. George]] and leave behind the 20-gun {{HMS|Acorn}} to protect the harbour.<ref name=\"RG178\">Gardinier, p. 178</ref> This not only weakened the squadron but also delayed it, Maxwell's force not departing Port St. George until 19:00.

By 11:00 it was evident that ''Persanne'' could not maintain the pace of the two larger frigates and so turned north-east in hopes of escaping independently. ''Active'' initially gave chase to the smaller ship, but Maxwell recalled her and sent ''Unite'' after ''Persanne'', keeping ''Active'' and ''Alceste'' in pursuit of the larger French ships.<ref name=\"WJ376\"/> At 11:50 it became clear that ''Alceste'' would soon catch the heavily laden French ships, and Maxwell sent the telegraph signal to Gordon; \"Remember the battle of Lissa\", the action of eight months before at which Hoste had raised the signal \"Remember Nelson\".<ref name=\"WJ377\"/>\n\nThe first shots were fired at 12:30 by ''Persanne'' close to the island of [[Palagru\u017ea|Pelagosa]] (Palagru\u017ea), but the main action did not begin for another hour, when ''Alceste'' and ''Pomone'' exchanged shots from their stern and bow guns.<ref name=\"WJ377\"/> By 13:40, ''Alceste'' was firing her broadside into ''Pomone'' and simultaneously pressing on all sail in an effort to reach ''Pauline'', but this ambition was thwarted when a shot from ''Pomone'' brought down ''Alceste''{{'}}s main topmast, slowing her suddenly and allowing ''Pauline'' to pull a little ahead. At 14:00, ''Active'' had arrived in action and was also firing into ''Pomone'', forcing Montfort to bring ''Pauline'' round to protect her outgunned colleague.<ref name=\"RG178\"/> By 14:20 the conflicts between ''Active'' and ''Pomone'' and ''Alceste'' and ''Pauline'' had separated into different duels, ''Pomone'' particularly suffering severely but ''Active'' also taking heavy damage, a 32-pounder [[carronade]] shot severing Captain Gordon's leg at the height of the engagement.<ref name=\"ODNBGord\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11054/?back=,18408 Gordon, Sir James Alexander] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305164840/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11054/?back=,18408 |date=5 March 2016 }}, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', J. K. Laughton, Retrieved 23 May 2008</ref>\n\nAt 15:05 another British ship appeared on the horizon, the sloop {{HMS|Kingfisher|1804|6}}, which persuaded Montfort that he could no longer protect the battered ''Pomone'' against superior numbers.<ref name=\"WJ377\">James, p. 377</ref> ''Pauline'' set all sail to the west, away from her opponents who were either too battered or too distant to pursue. ''Alceste'' and ''Active'' now concentrated their full broadsides on ''Pomone'', which soon lost both masts and was forced to surrender to prevent total destruction. ''Pauline'' escaped, later reaching [[Ancona]] safely but having suffered severe damage in the engagement.<ref name=\"WJ378\"/>\n\n===''Unite'' vs. ''Persanne''===\nThe secondary engagement of the battle was contested initially within sight of the other combatants, ''Persanne'' firing the first shots at the pursuing ''Unite'' at 12:30. The smaller size of these vessels made them faster and more manoeuvrable than their larger counterparts, and as a result it was not until 16:00 that ''Unite'' caught the smaller ship.<ref name=\"RG178\"/> During the pursuit, the ships had exchanged long-range shots from their stern and bow guns which caused six casualties aboard ''Unite'' but none on ''Persanne''. From external appearances, ''Persanne'' seemed to be a frigate of similar size to the [[fifth rate]] ''Unite'', but in fact the French ship was only lightly armed, carrying 26 small guns to her opponent's 36. As a result, when it became clear that his ship could not outrun ''Unite'', Captain Satie surrendered after firing a token broadside rather than be destroyed by the more powerful ship.<ref name=\"WJ379\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nCasualties suffered in the action were relatively heavy on both sides. The British ships, with their reduced crews, suffered 61 men killed or wounded while the French lost over 50 on ''Pomone'' alone. There were no casualties on ''Persanne'', and ''Pauline''{{'}}s losses are unknown, although believed to be heavy given her battered condition.<ref name=\"WJ378\">James, p. 378</ref> The French also lost the cargo aboard ''Persanne'' and ''Pomone'', which amounted to 201 bronze and iron cannon, 220 iron wheels for gun carriages and numerous other military stores.<ref name=\"WJ379\">James, p. 379</ref>\n\nPromotions were granted to the junior officers of ''Alceste'' and ''Active'' and both crews received praise and prize money for their service in the operation. Similar rewards were not made to the crew of ''Unite'', probably because ''Persanne'' was so much smaller and less-well armed than her opponent.<ref name=\"WJ380\"/> The total prize money was \u00a33,500,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16701|page=280|date=9 February 1913}}</ref> not as much as first anticipated because neither of the captured ships were of sufficient quality to warrant purchase into the Royal Navy. ''Pomone'' had been hastily built in 1803 as the personal warship of [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]] and as a result was of weak construction while ''Persanne'' had been designed as an armed storeship rather than a full-scale warship. Ultimately ''Pomone'' was transferred to Britain, briefly renamed {{HMS|Ambuscade}} and broken up for materials while ''Persanne'' was sold to the [[Bey of Tunis]].<ref name=\"WJ380\">James, p. 380</ref> Nearly four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]], awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.<ref name=\"LG4\">{{London Gazette|issue=20939|pages=236\u2013245|date=26 January 1849}}</ref>\n\nIn France, the action had more significant consequences. The loss of two ships and over 200 cannon was a serious blow to the French army marshalling in the Balkans. Napoleon himself took an interest in the engagement and it has been suggested by British historian James Henderson that this action convinced Napoleon of his inability to control the Adriatic Sea, which was vital to launching operations in the Balkans. This action may have been a factor in his decision to abandon plans to invade the Ottoman Empire, and instead to turn his [[French invasion of Russia|attention on Russia]].<ref name=\"JH153\">Henderson, p. 153</ref> In the French Navy, the flight of ''Pauline'' was deemed cowardly and Captain Montfort was court-martialled and relieved of command.<ref name=\"Roche\">Roche, vol.1 p.344</ref> In 1817, when [[Murray Maxwell]] visited [[St Helena]] on his return from the East Indies where HMS ''Alceste'' had been wrecked, Napoleon greeted him with the words \"Your government must not blame you for the loss of ''Alceste'', for you have taken one of my frigates\".<ref name=\"JH161\">Henderson, p. 161</ref>\n\nThe effects on the Adriatic itself were slight, the action only confirming the already overwhelming British dominance in the region. The French Navy would continue to seek reinforcements for their squadrons, concentrating on the construction of several new ships in Italian seaports that would not be ready until 1812. As a result, this was the last significant action of the year in the Adriatic.<ref name=\"RG179\">Gardinier, p. 179</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814|Adriatic Campaign]] \n*[[Murray Maxwell]] \n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Gardiner\n | first = Robert\n | authorlink =\n | year = 2001 |origyear=1998\n | chapter =\n | title = The Victory of Seapower\n | publisher = Caxton Editions\n | location =\n | isbn = 1-84067-359-1\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Henderson\n | first = James\n | authorlink = \n | year = 1994\n | origyear = 1970\n | chapter = \n | title = The Frigates\n | publisher = Leo Cooper\n | location = \n | isbn = 0-85052-432-6\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/frigatesaccounto0000hend\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = James\n | first = William\n | authorlink = William James (naval historian)\n | year = 2002 |origyear=1827\n | chapter =\n | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 5, 1808\u20131811\n | publisher = Conway Maritime Press\n | location =\n | isbn = 0-85177-909-3\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Roche\n | first = Jean-Michel\n | authorlink =\n | year =\n | chapter =\n | title = Dictionnaire des b\u00e2timents de la flotte de guerre fran\u00e7aise de Colbert \u00e0 nos jours\n | publisher =\n | location =\n | id = ISBN\n}}\n* {{London Gazette|issue=16586|pages=565\u2013567|date=24 March 1812}} Captain Murray Maxwell's despatch concerning the action in the [[London Gazette]].\n\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1811]]\n[[Category:Naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving France]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:History of the Adriatic Sea]]\n[[Category:November 1811 events]]\n", "text_old": "{{good article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict=Action of 29 November 1811\n|partof=the [[Napoleonic Wars]]\n|image=La Pomone contre les fregates Alceste et Active.jpg\n|image_size = 300px\n|alt=A naval painting in which a badly damaged ship in the foreground is flanked by two lightly damaged ships that are firing on the central vessel.\n|caption=''La Pomone contre les fr\u00e9gates HMS Alceste et Active''<br />[[Pierre Julien Gilbert]], 1836.

The action was one of a series of operations conducted by the British [[Royal Navy]] and the [[French Navy]] to contest dominance over the Adriatic between 1807 and 1814. During this period the Adriatic was surrounded by French territory or French client states and as a result British interference was highly disruptive to the movement of French troops and supplies.\n\nThe action came over eight months after the British had achieved a decisive victory over the French at the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Lissa]] and was the first squadron action since that engagement. The action of November 1811 was the result of the British interception of a French military convoy traveling from [[Corfu]] to [[Trieste]] with a consignment of cannon, and resulted in a British victory, only one French ship escaping capture by the British force. It has been suggested that this action was a factor in [[Napoleon]]'s decision to change the direction of his planned eastwards expansion in 1812 from the Balkans [[French invasion of Russia|to Russia]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{details|Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814}}\nSince the [[War of the Third Coalition]], the French had maintained client kingdoms in [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] that controlled the western shores of the Adriatic. Over the next four years, strategically important islands and territories had been seized in the treaties of [[Treaty of Tilsit|Tilsit]] and [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn|Sch\u00f6nbrunn]], giving Napoleon direct command of the eastern shore.<ref name=\"JH111\">Henderson, p. 111</ref> With these treaties, France had seized not only several important fortress islands, most notably [[Corfu]], but also many important shipyards and harbours. Maintaining control of the Adriatic was however even harder than seizing it had been, the threat of attack by [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]], Russian or [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] armies and the mountainous terrain of the [[Balkans]] forcing the development of garrisons that could be effectively resupplied only by sea.<ref name=\"JH111\"/>\n\nThe Royal Navy, preeminent in the [[Mediterranean]] since the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805, sought to disrupt French convoys across the Adriatic. Following the Russian withdrawal in 1807, the Royal Navy dispatched a small frigate squadron to operate in the sea. The squadron was commanded by Captain [[William Hoste]], who seized the Illyrian island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]] (present-day Vis) to use as a base, waging a campaign against the French and their allies that forced the French Navy to deploy significantly larger forces to combat him.<ref name=\"JH112\">Henderson, p. 112</ref> This escalating series of raid and counter raid continued until March 1811, when the French commander in the Adriatic, [[Bernard Dubourdieu]] attacked Lissa with force twice that available to Hoste. In the ensuing battle Hoste not only routed his opponents, but captured two ships, sank another and killed Dubourdieu.<ref name=\"ODNBHoste\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13844 Hoste, Sir William], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[J. K. Laughton]], Retrieved 22 May 2008</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Lissa, the badly wounded Hoste returned to Britain in {{HMS|Amphion|1798|6}} leaving Captain [[James Brisbane]] in command in the Adriatic. Conflict in the theatre was widely dispersed, and so Brisbane delegated command to various commanders of small squadrons and independent cruisers.<ref name=\"ODNBMax\"/> These dispersed forces continued to have success against French convoys; on 27 November 1811, the independently sailing {{HMS|Eagle|1804|6}} foiled an attempt to send supplies to Corfu and captured the unarmed frigate {{ship|French frigate|Corceyre||2}}. The following day at 07:00, a message was received at [[Vis (town)|Port St. George]] on Lissa warning that another French convoy had been sighted close to the island.<ref name=\"WJ375\">James, p. 375</ref>\n\n==Chase==\nThe British commander on Lissa in November 1811 was Captain [[Murray Maxwell]] of {{HMS|Alceste|1806|6}} with two other frigates and a [[sloop-of-war|sloop]].<ref name=\"ODNBMax\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18408 Maxwell, Sir Murray], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', J. K. Laughton, Retrieved 23 May 2008</ref>  Maxwell responded to the signal by readying his squadron to seek out and destroy the convoy, but the attempted invasion of Lissa the previous March had bred caution in the British defenders and Maxwell was therefore compelled to disembark 30 sailors and most of his marines at [[Vis (town)|Port St. George]] and leave behind the 20-gun {{HMS|Acorn}} to protect the harbour.<ref name=\"RG178\">Gardinier, p. 178</ref> This not only weakened the squadron but also delayed it, Maxwell's force not departing Port St. George until 19:00. It was assumed among the British squadron that the convoy comprised {{ship|French frigate|Dana\u00e9|1807|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Flore|1806|2}} and {{ship|Venetian ship|Corona||2}}, the survivors of the Battle of Lissa now sailing from [[Trieste]] to Corfu to supply the island.<ref name=\"WJ376\">James, p. 376</ref>\n\nShortly after passing the southern headland of Lissa, the British squadron encountered a neutral merchant ship that had been carrying Lieutenant John McDougal, formerly of {{HMS|Unite|1803|6}}, to [[Malta]].

The convoy had departed Corfu on 16 November carrying a cargo of [[cannon]] to Trieste.<ref name=\"WJ379\"/>\n\n===Squadrons===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Captain Maxwell's squadron\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n! width=10%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Ship </small>\n! width=10%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Rate </small>\n! width=5%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Guns </small>\n! width=5%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Navy </small>\n! width=25%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Commander </small>\n! width=15%; align= center colspan=3 | <small>Casualties</small>\n! width=30%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small>Notes</small>\n|-valign=\"top\"\n! width=5%; align= center  | <small> Killed </small>\n! width=5%; align= center  | <small> Wounded </small>\n! width=5%; align= center  | <small> Total</small>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | {{HMS|Alceste|1806|6}}\n| align= center  | [[Fifth rate]]\n| align= center  | 38\n| align= center  | {{flagicon|UK|naval}}\n| align= left  | Captain [[Murray Maxwell]]\n| align= right  | 7\n| align= right  | 13\n| align= right  | 20\n| align= left  |\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | {{HMS|Active|1799|6}}\n| align= center  | [[Fifth rate]]\n| align= center  | 38\n| align= center  | {{flagicon|UK|naval}}\n| align= left  | Captain [[James Alexander Gordon]]\n| align= right  | 9\n| align= right  | 26\n| align= right  | 35\n| align= left  |\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | {{HMS|Unite|1803|6}}\n| align= center  | [[Fifth rate]]\n| align= center  | 36\n| align= center  | {{flagicon|UK|naval}}\n| align= left  |Captain Edwin Henry Chamberlayne\n| align= right  | 2\n| align= right  | 4\n| align= right  | 6\n| align= left  |\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | {{HMS|Kingfisher|1804|6}}\n| align= center  | [[Sloop-of-war|Sloop]]\n| align= center  | 18\n| align= center  | {{flagicon|UK|naval}}\n| align= left  |Captain Ewell Tritton\n| align= right  | 0\n| align= right  | 0\n| align= right  | 0\n| align= left  |  Independent sailor, not engaged in the action.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Casualties: 18 killed, 43 wounded, 61 total\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Commodore Montfort's squadron\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n! width=10%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Ship </small>\n! width=10%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Rate </small>\n! width=5%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Guns </small>\n! width=5%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Navy </small>\n! width=25%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small> Commander </small>\n! width=15%; align= center colspan=3 | <small>Casualties</small>\n! width=30%; align= center rowspan=2 | <small>Notes</small>\n|-valign=\"top\"\n! width=5%; align= center  | <small> Killed </small>\n! width=5%; align= center  | <small> Wounded </small>\n! width=5%; align= center  | <small> Total</small>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Windward Division\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | {{ship|French frigate|Pauline|1807|2}}\n| align= center  | [[Fifth rate]]\n| align= center  | 40\n| align= center  | {{flagicon|France|naval}}\n| align= left  | Commodore [[Fran\u00e7ois-Gilles Montfort]]\n| align= right  | -\n| align= right  | -\n| align= right  | unknown\n| align= left  |\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | {{ship|French frigate|Pomone|1805|2}}\n| align= center  | [[Fifth rate]]\n| align= center  |  40\n| align= center  | {{flagicon|France|naval}}\n| align= left  | Captain [[Claude Charles Marie du Campe de Rosamel]]\n| align= right  | -\n| align= right  | -\n| align= right  | ~50\n| align= left  | Captured and taken to Britain, later broken up.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | {{ship|French ship|Persanne|1809|2}}\n| align= center  | [[Sixth rate]]\n| align= center  | 26\n| align= center  | {{flagicon|France|naval}}\n| align= left  | Captain Joseph-Andr\u00e9 Satie\n| align= right  | 3\n| align= right  | 4\n| align= right  | 7\n| align= left  | Captured and sold to the [[Bey of Tunis]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Casualties: At least 50 killed and wounded\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|colspan=\"9\" align=\"left\"|Sources: Gardiner, p.&nbsp;178; James, p.&nbsp;378\n|-\n|}\n\n'''Key'''\n* A \u2020 symbol indicates that the officer was killed during the action or subsequently died of wounds received.\n* The ships are ordered in the sequence in which they formed up for battle.\n\n==Battle==\nCasting south close to the island of [[Lastovo|Augusta]] (Lastovo), Captain Gordon in ''Active'' sighted the French force at 09:20 on 29 November, sailing to the north-west.<ref name=\"RG178\"/> Initially the French ships held their course, but on determining that the approaching squadron was British, Montfort spread all sail to escape pursuit. By 11:00 it was evident that ''Persanne'' could not maintain the pace of the two larger frigates and so turned north-east in hopes of escaping independently. ''Active'' initially gave chase to the smaller ship, but Maxwell recalled her and sent ''Unite'' after ''Persanne'', keeping ''Active'' and ''Alceste'' in pursuit of the larger French ships.<ref name=\"WJ376\"/> At 11:50 it became clear that ''Alceste'' would soon catch the heavily laden French ships, and Maxwell sent the telegraph signal to Gordon; \"Remember the battle of Lissa\", the action of eight months before at which Hoste had raised the signal \"Remember Nelson\".<ref name=\"WJ377\"/>\n\nThe first shots were fired at 12:30 by ''Persanne'' close to the island of [[Palagru\u017ea|Pelagosa]] (Palagru\u017ea), but the main action did not begin for another hour, when ''Alceste'' and ''Pomone'' exchanged shots from their stern and bow guns.<ref name=\"WJ377\"/> By 13:40, ''Alceste'' was firing her broadside into ''Pomone'' and simultaneously pressing on all sail in an effort to reach ''Pauline'', but this ambition was thwarted when a shot from ''Pomone'' brought down ''Alceste''{{'}}s main topmast, slowing her suddenly and allowing ''Pauline'' to pull a little ahead. At 14:00, ''Active'' had arrived in action and was also firing into ''Pomone'', forcing Montfort to bring ''Pauline'' round to protect her outgunned colleague.<ref name=\"RG178\"/> By 14:20 the conflicts between ''Active'' and ''Pomone'' and ''Alceste'' and ''Pauline'' had separated into different duels, ''Pomone'' particularly suffering severely but ''Active'' also taking heavy damage, a 32-pounder [[carronade]] shot severing Captain Gordon's leg at the height of the engagement.<ref name=\"ODNBGord\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11054/?back=,18408 Gordon, Sir James Alexander] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305164840/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11054/?back=,18408 |date=5 March 2016 }}, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', J. K. Laughton, Retrieved 23 May 2008</ref>\n\nAt 15:05 another British ship appeared on the horizon, the sloop {{HMS|Kingfisher|1804|6}}, which persuaded Montfort that he could no longer protect the battered ''Pomone'' against superior numbers.<ref name=\"WJ377\">James, p. 377</ref> ''Pauline'' set all sail to the west, away from her opponents who were either too battered or too distant to pursue. ''Alceste'' and ''Active'' now concentrated their full broadsides on ''Pomone'', which soon lost both masts and was forced to surrender to prevent total destruction. ''Pauline'' escaped, later reaching [[Ancona]] safely but having suffered severe damage in the engagement.<ref name=\"WJ378\"/>\n\n===''Unite'' vs. ''Persanne''===\nThe secondary engagement of the battle was contested initially within sight of the other combatants, ''Persanne'' firing the first shots at the pursuing ''Unite'' at 12:30. The smaller size of these vessels made them faster and more manoeuvrable than their larger counterparts, and as a result it was not until 16:00 that ''Unite'' caught the smaller ship.<ref name=\"RG178\"/> During the pursuit, the ships had exchanged long-range shots from their stern and bow guns which caused six casualties aboard ''Unite'' but none on ''Persanne''. From external appearances, ''Persanne'' seemed to be a frigate of similar size to the [[fifth rate]] ''Unite'', but in fact the French ship was only lightly armed, carrying 26 small guns to her opponent's 36. As a result, when it became clear that his ship could not outrun ''Unite'', Captain Satie surrendered after firing a token broadside rather than be destroyed by the more powerful ship.<ref name=\"WJ379\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nCasualties suffered in the action were relatively heavy on both sides. The British ships, with their reduced crews, suffered 61 men killed or wounded while the French lost over 50 on ''Pomone'' alone. There were no casualties on ''Persanne'', and ''Pauline''{{'}}s losses are unknown, although believed to be heavy given her battered condition.<ref name=\"WJ378\">James, p. 378</ref> The French also lost the cargo aboard ''Persanne'' and ''Pomone'', which amounted to 201 bronze and iron cannon, 220 iron wheels for gun carriages and numerous other military stores.<ref name=\"WJ379\">James, p. 379</ref>\n\nPromotions were granted to the junior officers of ''Alceste'' and ''Active'' and both crews received praise and prize money for their service in the operation. Similar rewards were not made to the crew of ''Unite'', probably because ''Persanne'' was so much smaller and less-well armed than her opponent.<ref name=\"WJ380\"/> The total prize money was \u00a33,500,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16701|page=280|date=9 February 1913}}</ref> not as much as first anticipated because neither of the captured ships were of sufficient quality to warrant purchase into the Royal Navy. ''Pomone'' had been hastily built in 1803 as the personal warship of [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]] and as a result was of weak construction while ''Persanne'' had been designed as an armed storeship rather than a full-scale warship. Ultimately ''Pomone'' was transferred to Britain, briefly renamed {{HMS|Ambuscade}} and broken up for materials while ''Persanne'' was sold to the [[Bey of Tunis]].<ref name=\"WJ380\">James, p. 380</ref> Nearly four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]], awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.<ref name=\"LG4\">{{London Gazette|issue=20939|pages=236\u2013245|date=26 January 1849}}</ref>\n\nIn France, the action had more significant consequences. The loss of two ships and over 200 cannon was a serious blow to the French army marshalling in the Balkans. Napoleon himself took an interest in the engagement and it has been suggested by British historian James Henderson that this action convinced Napoleon of his inability to control the Adriatic Sea, which was vital to launching operations in the Balkans. This action may have been a factor in his decision to abandon plans to invade the Ottoman Empire, and instead to turn his [[French invasion of Russia|attention on Russia]].<ref name=\"JH153\">Henderson, p. 153</ref> In the French Navy, the flight of ''Pauline'' was deemed cowardly and Captain Montfort was court-martialled and relieved of command.<ref name=\"Roche\">Roche, vol.1 p.344</ref> In 1817, when [[Murray Maxwell]] visited [[St Helena]] on his return from the East Indies where HMS ''Alceste'' had been wrecked, Napoleon greeted him with the words \"Your government must not blame you for the loss of ''Alceste'', for you have taken one of my frigates\".<ref name=\"JH161\">Henderson, p. 161</ref>\n\nThe effects on the Adriatic itself were slight, the action only confirming the already overwhelming British dominance in the region. The French Navy would continue to seek reinforcements for their squadrons, concentrating on the construction of several new ships in Italian seaports that would not be ready until 1812. As a result, this was the last significant action of the year in the Adriatic.<ref name=\"RG179\">Gardinier, p. 179</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814|Adriatic Campaign]] \n*[[Murray Maxwell]] \n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Gardiner\n | first = Robert\n | authorlink =\n | year = 2001 |origyear=1998\n | chapter =\n | title = The Victory of Seapower\n | publisher = Caxton Editions\n | location =\n | isbn = 1-84067-359-1\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Henderson\n | first = James\n | authorlink = \n | year = 1994\n | origyear = 1970\n | chapter = \n | title = The Frigates\n | publisher = Leo Cooper\n | location = \n | isbn = 0-85052-432-6\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/frigatesaccounto0000hend\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = James\n | first = William\n | authorlink = William James (naval historian)\n | year = 2002 |origyear=1827\n | chapter =\n | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 5, 1808\u20131811\n | publisher = Conway Maritime Press\n | location =\n | isbn = 0-85177-909-3\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Roche\n | first = Jean-Michel\n | authorlink =\n | year =\n | chapter =\n | title = Dictionnaire des b\u00e2timents de la flotte de guerre fran\u00e7aise de Colbert \u00e0 nos jours\n | publisher =\n | location =\n | id = ISBN\n}}\n* {{London Gazette|issue=16586|pages=565\u2013567|date=24 March 1812}} Captain Murray Maxwell's despatch concerning the action in the [[London Gazette]].\n\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1811]]\n[[Category:Naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving France]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:History of the Adriatic Sea]]\n[[Category:November 1811 events]]\n", "name_user": "Snagemit", "label": "safe", "comment": "Infobox changes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_of_29_November_1811"}

Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has worked for the past twenty years from a rural setting in his studio in Oxfordshire<ref>\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\", p.22.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space, like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, that become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>. This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke />\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77.

Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has worked for the past twenty years from a rural setting in his studio in Oxfordshire<ref>\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\", p.22.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

[[ceremonial county]] of [[Cornwall]], which includes the [[Isles of Scilly]], is divided into six [[United Kingdom constituencies|Parliamentary constituencies]]. They are all [[County constituency|county constituencies]].\n\n==Parliamentary history of Cornwall==\nAll six parliamentary seats are currently held by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], having came from holding no seats in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]], [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] and [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]], to gaining three of the six from the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], to gaining the remaining three to hold all six Cornish seats in [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. All six MPs were re-elected in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]]. In that election, several previous Liberal Democrat candidates, including previous MPs [[Andrew George (politician)|Andrew George]] and [[Steve Gilbert]] re-stood in their old seats, but failed to be re-elected. In all six seats, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] vote surged, pushing the Liberals into third place in four of the six seats. The last Labour MP for a Cornish constituency was [[Candy Atherton]], who held the seat of [[Falmouth and Camborne (UK Parliament constituency)|Falmouth and Camborne]] between 1997 and 2005.\n{{for|information on historical constituencies in Cornwall|Parliamentary representation from Cornwall}}\n\n==Constituencies==\n\n{{legend2|{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] \u2020|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] \u2021|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Liberal Democrats (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] \u00a4|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Constituency\n!rowspan=1|Electorate<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geo.digiminster.com/election/2015-05-07/results/Location/County/Cornwall|format = |title=2015 Electorates}}</ref>\n!rowspan=1|Majority<ref group=nb>The majority is the number of votes the winning candidate receives more than their nearest rival.</ref>\n!colspan=2 class=unsortable|Member of Parliament\n!colspan=2 class=unsortable|2nd-placed candidate\n!rowspan=1 class=unsortable|Electoral divisions<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/elections/polling-districts-and-polling-places-review-2014/|title=Polling Districts and Polling Places Review 2014|publisher=Cornwall Council|date=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n!rowspan=1 class=unsortable|Electoral wards (no longer used)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20071681_en_4|title=The Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 2007|publisher=Crown copyright|work=[[Office of Public Sector Information]]|accessdate=7 November 2009|date=13 June 2007}}</ref><ref>Boundary Commission for England pp. 1004\u20131007</ref>\n!rowspan=1 class=unsortable|Map\n|-\n|[[Camborne and Redruth (UK Parliament constituency)|Camborne and Redruth]]\n|70,250\n|8,700\n|bgcolor={{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}|&nbsp;\n|[[George Eustice]] \u2020\n|bgcolor={{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}|\n|Paul Farmer \u2021\n|\n* Camborne Pendarves\n* Camborne Roskear\n* Camborne Trelowarren\n* Camborne Treslothan\n* Camborne Treswithian\n* Carharrack, Gwennap and St Day\n** (Split between \"Camborne and Redruth\" and \"Truro and Falmouth\")\n* Constantine, Mawnan and Budock\n* Crowan and Wendron\n** (Split between \"Camborne and Redruth\" and \"St Ives\")\n* Four Lanes\n* Gwinear, Gwithian and St Erth\n** (Split between \"Camborne and Redruth\" and \"St Ives\")\n* Hayle North\n* Hayle South\n* Illogan\n* Lanner and Stithians\n* Mabe, Perranarworthal and St Gluvias\n** (Split between \"Camborne and Redruth\" and \"Truro and Falmouth\")\n* Mount Hawke and Portreath\n* Pool and Tehidy\n* Redruth Central\n* Redruth North\n* Redruth South\n* St Agnes\n** (Split between \"Camborne and Redruth\" and \"Truro and Falmouth\")\n* St Keverne and Meneage\n|\n* [[Carrick, Cornwall|Carrick District Council]]:\n** Mount Hawke\n* [[Kerrier|Kerrier District Council]]:\n** Camborne North\n** Camborne South\n** Camborne West\n** Constantine\n** Gweek and Mawnan\n** Illogan North\n** Illogan South\n** Mabe and Budock\n** Redruth North\n** Redruth South\n** St Day\n** Lanner and Carharrack\n** Stithians\n** Wendron\n* [[Penwith#Penwith District Council|Penwith District Council]]:\n** Gwinear, Gwithian and Hayle East\n** Hayle North\n** Hayle South\n|[[File:CamborneRedruth2007Constituency.svg|left|100px|alt=A small constituency.

Riley royally ruined an IG battle between himself and legend Babyface because he was doing too damn much. Black Twitter will roast him forever. (Riley credits [[Barry Michael Cooper]] for giving it its name.)<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Hogan, Paul. \"[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p118768/biography|pure_url=yes}} Teddy Riley biography]\" [[Allmusic]] Retrieved on September 19, 2009</ref> \n\nHe fused hip hop and R&B in his production work with artists including [[Michael Jackson]], [[Bobby Brown]], [[Keith Sweat]], [[Samantha Mumba]], [[Doug E. Fresh]], [[Today (band)|Today]], [[Heavy D|Heavy D & the Boyz]], [[Hi-Five]], [[Men of Vizion]] and [[Profyle]], as well as his spearheaded groups [[Guy (band)|Guy]] and [[Blackstreet]]. Riley's consistency and drum ideas had some influence on modern-day R&B, which since him contained more samples and rapping segments as well as singing, a practice which in part was reminiscent of the [[Jackson family]]. Along with [[Neo Soul]] style of singers such as [[Marvin Gaye]], he has had a seminal influence on [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[R&B]] music, which became more open to using rap and sound effects in their recordings.\n\n==Early life==\nTeddy Riley was raised in [[St. Nicholas Houses]] in [[Harlem]]. A [[child prodigy]] from the age of five, he began playing instruments in church. His uncle, who owned the famed Harlem club The Rooftop, built a studio in the club in which Riley would spend most of his time while growing up. By 14, upstate{{Dubious |Should \"upstate\" be \"Uptown\"?|reason=Harlem is \"Uptown\", not \"Upstate\"|date=March 2019}}  New York rappers began making music to his tracks. Under the guidance of local music producer Gene Griffin, Riley formed the short-lived group Kids at Work. At the age of 18, Riley produced [[Kool Moe Dee]]'s 12\" single, \"Go See the Doctor\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Released on an independent label in 1986, the song became a crossover hit, reaching No.89 on the [[Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Bush|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p58/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Kool Moe Dee > Biography|website=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|location=San Francisco, California|accessdate=October 24, 2018}}</ref> Riley had previously worked on the production of [[Doug E.

Managed by Gene Griffin, Riley's work with Guy pioneered the \"[[new jack swing]]\" style of R&B. Riley infused his own blend of [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] beats, R&B [[Chord progression|progressions]] and the [[Gospel music|gospel]] vocal stylings of Hall to create the archetypal new jack swing sound on Guy's [[Guy (album)|eponymous debut]]. In 1989, Riley produced [[Big Daddy Kane]]'s \"I Get The Job Done\", as well as other work for [[The Jacksons]], [[The Winans]] and [[James Ingram]].  He also created the highly successful remix of [[Jane Child]], \"[[Don't Wanna Fall in Love]]\", which became a crossover pop smash.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nAfter the release and tour of Guy's second album, ''[[The Future (Guy album)|The Future]]'', Riley co-produced half of [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'' album on the recommendation of Jackson's long-time producer [[Quincy Jones]].{{cn|date=August 2019}} After the disbandment of [[Guy (band)|Guy]] in 1992, Riley moved to production, performance on and promotion of [[Wreckx-N-Effect]]'s second album ''[[Hard or Smooth]]''. {{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn late 1991, Riley formed a second group, [[Blackstreet]]. The group would go on to release several major hits, including \"Don't Leave Me\" (1997), the number one single \"[[No Diggity]]\" (1996, featuring [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Queen Pen]]), and \"[[Girlfriend/Boyfriend]]\" (1999, with [[Janet Jackson]], [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]], and [[Ja Rule]]). By 2011, the group had disbanded and reformed several times.\n\nIn 2000, Riley worked with [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]] [[Melanie B]] on three tracks \u2013 \"ABC 123,\" \"I Believe\" and \"Pack Your S**t\"\u2014for her solo debut album, ''[[Hot (Melanie Brown album)|Hot]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Melanie-B-Hot/release/388257 |title=Melanie B \u2013 Hot (CD, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date=October 9, 2000 |accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref> He also worked on an album with Outsiderz 4 Life, producing \"Wil' Out\" and other songs.\n\nAt the start of 2006, he was part of the [[New Jack Reunion Tour]], featuring Blackstreet and Guy, in addition to [[After 7]], [[SWV]], and [[Tony Toni Ton\u00e9]]. In May 2006 Riley announced that he would be working on two key projects: a new Blackstreet album and a new Guy album.\n\nIn June 2008, a fire destroyed Riley's [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]] recording studio. Fire investigators said that an electrical problem caused the blaze that burned the abandoned recording studio. The Virginia Beach Fire Department said lightning in the area also could have been a factor, although there was no direct\nstrike.  The empty studio was for sale and was insured for $336,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wvec.com/news/vabeach/stories/wvec_local_071608_riley_studio_fire_.5f16b374.html |title=Electrical problem caused fire at Riley studio in Va.

Leading on from his work on [[Snoop Dogg]]'s album ''[[Ego Trippin']]'', Riley became part of the production supergroup [[QDT]], which features [[DJ Quik]] as well as Snoop Dogg.\n\nRiley produced and co-wrote the song \"Teeth\" with [[Lady Gaga]] for her EP ''[[The Fame Monster]]''. Speaking in March 2010 to [[Blues & Soul]]'s Pete Lewis \u2013 Riley said that he was no longer affiliated with Guy (Riley had last performed with the group in October 2010).

Fresh]], [[Today (band)|Today]], [[Heavy D|Heavy D & the Boyz]], [[Hi-Five]], [[Men of Vizion]] and [[Profyle]], as well as his spearheaded groups [[Guy (band)|Guy]] and [[Blackstreet]]. Riley's consistency and drum ideas had some influence on modern-day R&B, which since him contained more samples and rapping segments as well as singing, a practice which in part was reminiscent of the [[Jackson family]]. Along with [[Neo Soul]] style of singers such as [[Marvin Gaye]], he has had a seminal influence on [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[R&B]] music, which became more open to using rap and sound effects in their recordings.\n\n==Early life==\nTeddy Riley was raised in [[St. Nicholas Houses]] in [[Harlem]]. A [[child prodigy]] from the age of five, he began playing instruments in church. His uncle, who owned the famed Harlem club The Rooftop, built a studio in the club in which Riley would spend most of his time while growing up.

Managed by Gene Griffin, Riley's work with Guy pioneered the \"[[new jack swing]]\" style of R&B. Riley infused his own blend of [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] beats, R&B [[Chord progression|progressions]] and the [[Gospel music|gospel]] vocal stylings of Hall to create the archetypal new jack swing sound on Guy's [[Guy (album)|eponymous debut]]. In 1989, Riley produced [[Big Daddy Kane]]'s \"I Get The Job Done\", as well as other work for [[The Jacksons]], [[The Winans]] and [[James Ingram]].

constituency)|Cambridgeshire]] and [[Huntingdonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdonshire]], along with all other English Counties regardless of size or population, had elected 2 MPs to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in accordance with the freehold property franchise.  In addition the Parliamentary Boroughs of [[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]] and [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] had been represented since 1295, each also returning 2 MPs. [[Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Peterborough]], which was historically part of Northamptonshire, first returned 2 MPs in 1541. The only change resulting from the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832, which radically changed the representation of the House of Commons, was to increase the representation of Cambridgeshire to 3 MPs. Under the [[Representation of the People Act 1867|Reform Act of 1867]], the representation of the Borough of Huntingdon was reduced to 1 MP.\n\nAdditionally, [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]] returned two Members of Parliament from 1603 to 1950. However it was not a geographic area and instead represented the graduates of the university.\n\n=== 1885-1918 ===\nUnder the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]], the representation of the Borough of Cambridge was reduced to 1 MP and Cambridgeshire was divided into 3 single-member constituencies, namely the Northern or [[Wisbech (UK Parliament constituency)|Wisbech]] Division, the Eastern or [[Newmarket (UK Parliament constituency)|Newmarket]] Division and the Western or [[Chesterton (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesterton]] Division. The Borough of Huntingdon was abolished and Huntingdonshire was divided into 2 single-member Constituencies, namely the Northern or [[Ramsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Ramsey]] Division and the Southern or [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] Division. The representation of the Borough of Peterborough was also reduced to 1 MP.\n\nThe table shows an approximate representation of the development of constituencies in Cambridgeshire since 1885. The text below gives a more detailed description.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!1885-1918\n!1918-1974\n!1974-1983\n!1983-1997\n!1997\u2013present\n|-\n|[[Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Peterborough]] BC\n|''Peterborough CC''<sup>1</sup>\n|Peterborough BC\n|Peterborough BC\n|Peterborough BC\n|-\n|[[Ramsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Ramsey]] CC\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Huntingdonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdonshire]] CC\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Huntingdonshire CC\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Huntingdon CC\n|North West Cambridgeshire CC\n|-\n|[[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] CC\n|Huntingdon CC\n|-\n|[[Wisbech (UK Parliament constituency)|Wisbech]] CC\n|[[Isle of Ely (UK Parliament constituency)|Isle of Ely]] CC\n|Isle of Ely CC\n|[[North East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|North East Cambridgeshire CC\n|-\n|[[Newmarket (UK Parliament constituency)|Newmarket]] CC\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridgeshire]] CC\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Cambridgeshire CC\n|[[South East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South East Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|South East Cambridgeshire CC\n|-\n|[[Chesterton (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesterton]] CC\n|[[South West Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|[[South Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|-\n|[[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]] BC\n|Cambridge BC\n|Cambridge BC\n|Cambridge BC\n|Cambridge BC\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |BC = Borough Constituency (prior to 1950 - Parliamentary Borough or Division thereof)\nCC = County Constituency (prior to 1950 - Parliamentary County of Division thereof)\n|}\n<sup>1</sup>''Part of Northamptonshire with the Soke of Peterborough''\n\n=== 1918-1974 ===\nUnder the [[Local Government Act 1888]], which created county councils, the [[Isle of Ely]] and the [[Soke of Peterborough]] had been created as a separate [[Administrative counties of England|administrative counties]], hived off from Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire respectively. These changes were not reflected until the parliamentary constituencies were next redistributed by the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]].  The Wisbech Division was replaced by the Parliamentary County of [[Isle of Ely (UK Parliament constituency)|Isle of Ely]], including the city of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], which had been in the Newmarket Division, and a small area in the north of the Chesterton Division.  Areas of the expanded [[Cambridge|Municipal Borough of Cambridge]] which had been in the Chesterton Division were now included in the Parliamentary Borough, with the remainder of Newmarket and Chesterton being combined to form the re-established Parliamentary County of [[Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridgeshire]].  The Ramsey and Huntingdon Divisions were also combined to form the re-established Parliamentary County of Huntingdonshire. Peterborough was abolished as a Parliamentary Borough and reconstituted as a Division of Northamptonshire with the Soke of Peterborough, absorbing the bulk of the abolished [[North Northamptonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Northern Division of Northamptonshire]].\n\nThese constituencies remained more-or-less unchanged until 1974.\n\n=== 1974-1983 ===\nIn 1965 the administrative counties of Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely, and Huntingdonshire and the Soke of Peterborough, were combined to form [[Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely]] and [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]] respectively. Following the Second Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies, which came into effect for the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], Peterborough was redesignated as a [[Borough constituency|Borough Constituency]], composed of the local authorities which had comprised the Soke, together with the small [[Thorney Rural District|Rural District of Thorney]], which was transferred from the county/constituency of Isle of Ely. The parts in Northamptonshire were transferred to the county constituency of [[Wellingborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Wellingborough]].  The only other change affected Huntingdonshire, gaining the village of [[Eaton Socon]], which had been in the county of [[Bedfordshire]]/constituency of [[Mid Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Bedfordshire]], and had been absorbed into the [[St Neots|Urban District of St Neots]].\n\n=== 1983-1997 ===\nThe Third Review reflected the 1974 local government reorganisation arising from the [[Local Government Act 1972]] which saw a further rationalisation resulting in the two recently created administrative counties being combined to form the [[non-metropolitan county]] of [[Cambridgeshire]]. The review resulted in the first major redistribution of seats since 1918, with the abolition of the three county constituencies of Huntingdonshire, Isle of Ely and Cambridgeshire, and the creation of four new county constituencies:\n\n* [[Huntingdon]] comprised the majority of the former constituency of Huntingdonshire, including [[Huntingdon]], [[Godmanchester]], [[Ramsey, Cambridgeshire|Ramsey]] and [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]].\u00a0 Areas to the west of Peterborough, including [[Barnack]] and [[Werrington, Peterborough|Werrington]], were transferred from the borough constituency of Peterborough, whilst areas to the south of the [[River Nene]], including [[Fletton]] and [[Orton, Peterborough|the Ortons]], which were now part of the expanded [[Peterborough|City of Peterborough]], were included in Peterborough.\n* [[North East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Cambridgeshire]] was formed from the Isle of Ely, with the exception of the city of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] itself. It also included [[Thorney, Cambridgeshire|Thorney]] and [[Eye, Cambridgeshire|Eye]], transferred back from Peterborough.\n* [[South East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South East Cambridgeshire]] included eastern areas, comprising the majority, of the former constituency of Cambridgeshire, as well as the city of Ely.\n* [[South West Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Cambridgeshire]] was made up from parts of three existing constituencies: southern parts of Huntingdonshire, including [[St Neots]]; western parts of Cambridgeshire; and the wards of Trumpington and Queen Edith's, transferred from Cambridge.\n\n=== 1997-2010 ===\nThe Fourth Review saw another increase in the number of constituencies, with the creation of the county constituency of [[North West Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Cambridgeshire]].  This was formed from northern parts of Huntingdon, including Ramsey, and parts of Peterborough, comprising areas to the south of the River Nene (wards of Fletton, Orton Langueville, Orton Waterville and [[Stanground, Peterborough|Stanground]]). Werrington ward was transferred from Huntingdon to Peterborough. To compensate for the loss of northern areas, Huntingdon gained southern parts of the former county, including St Neots, from South West Cambridgeshire, which was consequently renamed [[South Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Cambridgeshire]]. Other changes included the transfer of north-western areas from South East Cambridgeshire to South Cambridgeshire and a small area from North East Cambridgeshire to South East Cambridgeshire.\n\n=== 2010-present ===\nThe 2007 report of the [[Boundary Commission for England]] retained the same seven constituencies that had existed since the 1997 election, with minor boundary changes to align with current local government wards and to better equalise the electorates. These changes, which were implemented at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], included the transfer back of Thorney and Eye from North East Cambridgeshire to Peterborough, the return of the Cambridge ward of Trumpington from South Cambridgeshire to the Cambridge constituency, and small transfers of rural wards from North West Cambridgeshire to Huntingdon, and from South East Cambridgeshire to South Cambridgeshire.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp;\n!Name\n!Boundaries 1997 \u2013 2010\n!Boundaries 2010 \u2013 present\n|-\n|1\n|[[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge BC]]\n| rowspan=\"7\" |[[File:CambridgeshireParliamentaryConstituenciesNumbered.svg|left]]\n| rowspan=\"7\" |[[File:CambridgeshireParliamentaryConstituencies2007.svg|left]]\n|-\n|2\n|[[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon CC]]\n|-\n|3\n|[[North East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Cambridgeshire CC]]\n|-\n|4\n|[[North West Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Cambridgeshire CC]]\n|-\n|5\n|[[Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Peterborough BC]]\n|-\n|6\n|[[South Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Cambridgeshire CC]]\n|-\n|7\n|[[South East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South East Cambridgeshire CC]]\n|}\n\n==Changes proposed in 2018==\nThe [[Boundary Commission for England]] submitted their final proposals in respect of the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies]] (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] they were not brought forward by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] for approval. Accordingly, they will '''not''' come into effect for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]] due to take place on 12 December 2019, which will be contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]], the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota. The review was carried out using the official UK electorate figures for 2015 and the electoral quota was set at 74,769, establishing a range of 71,031 to 78,507.\n\nIn order to meet these requirements, the Commission has recommended that Cambridgeshire be combined with Hertfordshire and Norfolk as a sub-region of the Eastern Region. This entails the transfer of four [[South Cambridgeshire|District of South Cambridgeshire]] wards, to the north of the Hertfordshire town of [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]], from South Cambridgeshire to the constituency of [[North East Hertfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Hertfordshire]] (to be renamed Letchworth and Royston); and the transfer of the two [[East Cambridgeshire|District of East Cambridgeshire]] wards which comprise the village of [[Littleport, Cambridgeshire|Littleport]] from North East Cambridgeshire to the constituency of [[South West Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Norfolk]] (to be renamed Thetford and Downham Market). After allowing for these movements, the Commission has proposed that the existing seven constituencies be retained with Huntingdon being renamed '''Huntingdon and St Neots'''.\n\nOther changes proposed to bring the constituencies within the required electoral quota range include: the City of Peterborough ward of [[Fletton]] and [[Woodston, Peterborough|Woodstone]] from North West Cambridgeshire to Peterborough; the District of Huntingdonshire ward of [[Earith]] from North West Cambridgeshire to South East Cambridgeshire; the District of Huntingdonshire ward of Gransden and the Offords from Huntingdon to South Cambridgeshire; the District of South Cambridgeshire wards of Fulbourn, Linton and Teversham from South East Cambridgeshire to South Cambridgeshire; and the City of Cambridge ward of Queen Edith's from South Cambridgeshire to Cambridge.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Current constituencies'''\n|'''Electorate'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|title=The electorate of each region subdivided by both local authorities and each existing constituency|last=Boundary Commission for England, 2018 Review, Associated consultation documents (Document type: Electoral data)|date=24 February 2016|access-date=9 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215741/https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|archive-date=15 February 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|'''Proposed constituencies'''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|title=Final recommendations constituency list (with wards)|last=Boundary Commission for England, 2018 Review, Associated consultation documents|date=September 2018|access-date=2019-03-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215741/https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|archive-date=2019-02-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|'''Electorate'''<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n|[[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]] BC\n|67,266\n|Cambridge BC\n|72,757\n|-\n|[[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] CC\n|81,303\n|Huntingdon and St Neots CC\n|77,715\n|-\n|[[North East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|81,779\n|North East Cambridgeshire CC\n|75,727\n|-\n|[[North West Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|89,991\n|North West Cambridgeshire CC\n|78,279\n|-\n|[[Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Peterborough]] BC\n|70,623\n|Peterborough BC\n|77,607\n|-\n|[[South Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|81,368\n|South Cambridgeshire CC\n|76,968\n|-\n|[[South East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South East Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|82,557\n|South East Cambridgeshire CC\n|78,304\n|-\n|\n|\n|Letchworth and Royston CC (part)\n|11,478\n|-\n|\n|\n|Thetford and Downham Market CC (part)\n|6,052\n|-\n|\n|'''554,887'''\n|\n|'''554,887'''\n|}\n\n==Historical representation by party==\nA cell marked \u2192 (with a different colour background to the preceding cell) indicates that the previous MP continued to sit under a new party name.\n\n===1885 to 1918 (6 MPs)===\n{{legend2|{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Constituency\n!1885\n!1886\n!''87''\n!''91''\n!1892\n!1895\n!1900\n!''03''\n!1906\n!Jan 1910\n!Dec 1910\n!''13''\n!''17''\n|-\n|[[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"8\" |[[Sir Robert Uniacke-Penrose-Fitzgerald, 1st Baronet|Uniacke-Penrose-Fitzgerald]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Stanley Buckmaster, 1st Viscount Buckmaster|Buckmaster]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"3\" |[[Almeric Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough|Paget]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Eric Campbell Geddes|Geddes]]\n|-\n|[[Chesterton (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesterton]] \n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"4\" |[[Charles Hall (lawyer)|Hall]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Hugh Edward Hoare|Hoare]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"3\" |[[Sir Walter Greene, 2nd Baronet|Greene]]\n| colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Edwin Samuel Montagu|E.

constituency)|Cambridgeshire]] and [[Huntingdonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdonshire]], along with all other English Counties regardless of size or population, had elected 2 MPs to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in accordance with the freehold property franchise.  In addition the Parliamentary Boroughs of [[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]] and [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] had been represented since 1295, each also returning 2 MPs. [[Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Peterborough]], which was historically part of Northamptonshire, first returned 2 MPs in 1541. The only change resulting from the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832, which radically changed the representation of the House of Commons, was to increase the representation of Cambridgeshire to 3 MPs. Under the [[Representation of the People Act 1867|Reform Act of 1867]], the representation of the Borough of Huntingdon was reduced to 1 MP.\n\nAdditionally, [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]] returned two Members of Parliament from 1603 to 1950. However it was not a geographic area and instead represented the graduates of the university.\n\n=== 1885-1918 ===\nUnder the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]], the representation of the Borough of Cambridge was reduced to 1 MP and Cambridgeshire was divided into 3 single-member constituencies, namely the Northern or [[Wisbech (UK Parliament constituency)|Wisbech]] Division, the Eastern or [[Newmarket (UK Parliament constituency)|Newmarket]] Division and the Western or [[Chesterton (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesterton]] Division. The Borough of Huntingdon was abolished and Huntingdonshire was divided into 2 single-member Constituencies, namely the Northern or [[Ramsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Ramsey]] Division and the Southern or [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] Division. The representation of the Borough of Peterborough was also reduced to 1 MP.\n\nThe table shows an approximate representation of the development of constituencies in Cambridgeshire since 1885. The text below gives a more detailed description.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!1885-1918\n!1918-1974\n!1974-1983\n!1983-1997\n!1997\u2013present\n|-\n|[[Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Peterborough]] BC\n|''Peterborough CC''<sup>1</sup>\n|Peterborough BC\n|Peterborough BC\n|Peterborough BC\n|-\n|[[Ramsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Ramsey]] CC\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Huntingdonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdonshire]] CC\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Huntingdonshire CC\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Huntingdon CC\n|North West Cambridgeshire CC\n|-\n|[[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] CC\n|Huntingdon CC\n|-\n|[[Wisbech (UK Parliament constituency)|Wisbech]] CC\n|[[Isle of Ely (UK Parliament constituency)|Isle of Ely]] CC\n|Isle of Ely CC\n|[[North East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|North East Cambridgeshire CC\n|-\n|[[Newmarket (UK Parliament constituency)|Newmarket]] CC\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridgeshire]] CC\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Cambridgeshire CC\n|[[South East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South East Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|South East Cambridgeshire CC\n|-\n|[[Chesterton (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesterton]] CC\n|[[South West Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|[[South Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|-\n|[[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]] BC\n|Cambridge BC\n|Cambridge BC\n|Cambridge BC\n|Cambridge BC\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |BC = Borough Constituency (prior to 1950 - Parliamentary Borough or Division thereof)\nCC = County Constituency (prior to 1950 - Parliamentary County of Division thereof)\n|}\n<sup>1</sup>''Part of Northamptonshire with the Soke of Peterborough''\n\n=== 1918-1974 ===\nUnder the [[Local Government Act 1888]], which created county councils, the [[Isle of Ely]] and the [[Soke of Peterborough]] had been created as a separate [[Administrative counties of England|administrative counties]], hived off from Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire respectively. These changes were not reflected until the parliamentary constituencies were next redistributed by the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]].  The Wisbech Division was replaced by the Parliamentary County of [[Isle of Ely (UK Parliament constituency)|Isle of Ely]], including the city of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], which had been in the Newmarket Division, and a small area in the north of the Chesterton Division.  Areas of the expanded [[Cambridge|Municipal Borough of Cambridge]] which had been in the Chesterton Division were now included in the Parliamentary Borough, with the remainder of Newmarket and Chesterton being combined to form the re-established Parliamentary County of [[Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridgeshire]].  The Ramsey and Huntingdon Divisions were also combined to form the re-established Parliamentary County of Huntingdonshire. Peterborough was abolished as a Parliamentary Borough and reconstituted as a Division of Northamptonshire with the Soke of Peterborough, absorbing the bulk of the abolished [[North Northamptonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Northern Division of Northamptonshire]].\n\nThese constituencies remained more-or-less unchanged until 1974.\n\n=== 1974-1983 ===\nIn 1965 the administrative counties of Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely, and Huntingdonshire and the Soke of Peterborough, were combined to form [[Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely]] and [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]] respectively. Following the Second Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies, which came into effect for the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], Peterborough was redesignated as a [[Borough constituency|Borough Constituency]], composed of the local authorities which had comprised the Soke, together with the small [[Thorney Rural District|Rural District of Thorney]], which was transferred from the county/constituency of Isle of Ely. The parts in Northamptonshire were transferred to the county constituency of [[Wellingborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Wellingborough]].  The only other change affected Huntingdonshire, gaining the village of [[Eaton Socon]], which had been in the county of [[Bedfordshire]]/constituency of [[Mid Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Bedfordshire]], and had been absorbed into the [[St Neots|Urban District of St Neots]].\n\n=== 1983-1997 ===\nThe Third Review reflected the 1974 local government reorganisation arising from the [[Local Government Act 1972]] which saw a further rationalisation resulting in the two recently created administrative counties being combined to form the [[non-metropolitan county]] of [[Cambridgeshire]]. The review resulted in the first major redistribution of seats since 1918, with the abolition of the three county constituencies of Huntingdonshire, Isle of Ely and Cambridgeshire, and the creation of four new county constituencies:\n\n* [[Huntingdon]] comprised the majority of the former constituency of Huntingdonshire, including [[Huntingdon]], [[Godmanchester]], [[Ramsey, Cambridgeshire|Ramsey]] and [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]].\u00a0 Areas to the west of Peterborough, including [[Barnack]] and [[Werrington, Peterborough|Werrington]], were transferred from the borough constituency of Peterborough, whilst areas to the south of the [[River Nene]], including [[Fletton]] and [[Orton, Peterborough|the Ortons]], which were now part of the expanded [[Peterborough|City of Peterborough]], were included in Peterborough.\n* [[North East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Cambridgeshire]] was formed from the Isle of Ely, with the exception of the city of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] itself. It also included [[Thorney, Cambridgeshire|Thorney]] and [[Eye, Cambridgeshire|Eye]], transferred back from Peterborough.\n* [[South East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South East Cambridgeshire]] included eastern areas, comprising the majority, of the former constituency of Cambridgeshire, as well as the city of Ely.\n* [[South West Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Cambridgeshire]] was made up from parts of three existing constituencies: southern parts of Huntingdonshire, including [[St Neots]]; western parts of Cambridgeshire; and the wards of Trumpington and Queen Edith's, transferred from Cambridge.\n\n=== 1997-2010 ===\nThe Fourth Review saw another increase in the number of constituencies, with the creation of the county constituency of [[North West Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Cambridgeshire]].  This was formed from northern parts of Huntingdon, including Ramsey, and parts of Peterborough, comprising areas to the south of the River Nene (wards of Fletton, Orton Langueville, Orton Waterville and [[Stanground, Peterborough|Stanground]]). Werrington ward was transferred from Huntingdon to Peterborough. To compensate for the loss of northern areas, Huntingdon gained southern parts of the former county, including St Neots, from South West Cambridgeshire, which was consequently renamed [[South Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Cambridgeshire]]. Other changes included the transfer of north-western areas from South East Cambridgeshire to South Cambridgeshire and a small area from North East Cambridgeshire to South East Cambridgeshire.\n\n=== 2010-present ===\nThe 2007 report of the [[Boundary Commission for England]] retained the same seven constituencies that had existed since the 1997 election, with minor boundary changes to align with current local government wards and to better equalise the electorates. These changes, which were implemented at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], included the transfer back of Thorney and Eye from North East Cambridgeshire to Peterborough, the return of the Cambridge ward of Trumpington from South Cambridgeshire to the Cambridge constituency, and small transfers of rural wards from North West Cambridgeshire to Huntingdon, and from South East Cambridgeshire to South Cambridgeshire.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp;\n!Name\n!Boundaries 1997 \u2013 2010\n!Boundaries 2010 \u2013 present\n|-\n|1\n|[[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge BC]]\n| rowspan=\"7\" |[[File:CambridgeshireParliamentaryConstituenciesNumbered.svg|left]]\n| rowspan=\"7\" |[[File:CambridgeshireParliamentaryConstituencies2007.svg|left]]\n|-\n|2\n|[[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon CC]]\n|-\n|3\n|[[North East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Cambridgeshire CC]]\n|-\n|4\n|[[North West Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Cambridgeshire CC]]\n|-\n|5\n|[[Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Peterborough BC]]\n|-\n|6\n|[[South Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Cambridgeshire CC]]\n|-\n|7\n|[[South East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South East Cambridgeshire CC]]\n|}\n\n== Changes proposed by the Boundary Commission<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|title=Final recommendations report|last=Boundary Commission for England, 2018 Review, Associated consultation documents|date=September 2018|access-date=2019-03-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215741/https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|archive-date=2019-02-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> ==\nThe [[Boundary Commission for England]] submitted their final proposals in respect of the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies]] (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] they were not brought forward by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] for approval. Accordingly, they will '''not''' come into effect for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]] due to take place on 12 December 2019, which will be contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]], the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota. The review was carried out using the official UK electorate figures for 2015 and the electoral quota was set at 74,769, establishing a range of 71,031 to 78,507.\n\nIn order to meet these requirements, the Commission has recommended that Cambridgeshire be combined with Hertfordshire and Norfolk as a sub-region of the Eastern Region. This entails the transfer of four [[South Cambridgeshire|District of South Cambridgeshire]] wards, to the north of the Hertfordshire town of [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]], from South Cambridgeshire to the constituency of [[North East Hertfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Hertfordshire]] (to be renamed Letchworth and Royston); and the transfer of the two [[East Cambridgeshire|District of East Cambridgeshire]] wards which comprise the village of [[Littleport, Cambridgeshire|Littleport]] from North East Cambridgeshire to the constituency of [[South West Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Norfolk]] (to be renamed Thetford and Downham Market). After allowing for these movements, the Commission has proposed that the existing seven constituencies be retained with Huntingdon being renamed '''Huntingdon and St Neots'''.\n\nOther changes proposed to bring the constituencies within the required electoral quota range include: the City of Peterborough ward of [[Fletton]] and [[Woodston, Peterborough|Woodstone]] from North West Cambridgeshire to Peterborough; the District of Huntingdonshire ward of [[Earith]] from North West Cambridgeshire to South East Cambridgeshire; the District of Huntingdonshire ward of Gransden and the Offords from Huntingdon to South Cambridgeshire; the District of South Cambridgeshire wards of Fulbourn, Linton and Teversham from South East Cambridgeshire to South Cambridgeshire; and the City of Cambridge ward of Queen Edith's from South Cambridgeshire to Cambridge.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Current constituencies'''\n|'''Electorate'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|title=The electorate of each region subdivided by both local authorities and each existing constituency|last=Boundary Commission for England, 2018 Review, Associated consultation documents (Document type: Electoral data)|date=24 February 2016|access-date=9 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215741/https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|archive-date=15 February 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|'''Proposed constituencies'''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|title=Final recommendations constituency list (with wards)|last=Boundary Commission for England, 2018 Review, Associated consultation documents|date=September 2018|access-date=2019-03-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215741/https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|archive-date=2019-02-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|'''Electorate'''<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n|[[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]] BC\n|67,266\n|Cambridge BC\n|72,757\n|-\n|[[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] CC\n|81,303\n|Huntingdon and St Neots CC\n|77,715\n|-\n|[[North East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|81,779\n|North East Cambridgeshire CC\n|75,727\n|-\n|[[North West Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|89,991\n|North West Cambridgeshire CC\n|78,279\n|-\n|[[Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Peterborough]] BC\n|70,623\n|Peterborough BC\n|77,607\n|-\n|[[South Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|81,368\n|South Cambridgeshire CC\n|76,968\n|-\n|[[South East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South East Cambridgeshire]] CC\n|82,557\n|South East Cambridgeshire CC\n|78,304\n|-\n|\n|\n|Letchworth and Royston CC (part)\n|11,478\n|-\n|\n|\n|Thetford and Downham Market CC (part)\n|6,052\n|-\n|\n|'''554,887'''\n|\n|'''554,887'''\n|}\n\n==Historical representation by party==\nA cell marked \u2192 (with a different colour background to the preceding cell) indicates that the previous MP continued to sit under a new party name.\n\n===1885 to 1918 (6 MPs)===\n{{legend2|{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Constituency\n!1885\n!1886\n!''87''\n!''91''\n!1892\n!1895\n!1900\n!''03''\n!1906\n!Jan 1910\n!Dec 1910\n!''13''\n!''17''\n|-\n|[[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"8\" |[[Sir Robert Uniacke-Penrose-Fitzgerald, 1st Baronet|Uniacke-Penrose-Fitzgerald]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Stanley Buckmaster, 1st Viscount Buckmaster|Buckmaster]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"3\" |[[Almeric Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough|Paget]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Eric Campbell Geddes|Geddes]]\n|-\n|[[Chesterton (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesterton]] \n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"4\" |[[Charles Hall (lawyer)|Hall]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Hugh Edward Hoare|Hoare]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"3\" |[[Sir Walter Greene, 2nd Baronet|Greene]]\n| colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |[[Edwin Samuel Montagu|E.
