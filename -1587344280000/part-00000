As noted by one reviewer, \"Bukowski continued to be, thanks to his antics and deliberate clownish performances, the king of the underground and the epitome of the littles in the ensuing decades, stressing his loyalty to those small press editors who had first championed his work and consolidating his presence in new ventures such as the ''[[New York Quarterly]]'', ''[[Chiron Review]]'', or ''[[Slipstream Magazine|Slipstream]]''.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/Charles-Bukowski-King-of-the-Underground/?K=9781137343543 |title=Charles Bukowski, King of the Underground From Obscurity to Literary Icon |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}</ref> Some of these works include his ''Poems Written Before Jumping Out of an 8 Story Window'', published by his friend and fellow poet [[Charles Potts]], and better known works such as ''Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame''. These poems and stories were later republished by [[John Martin (publisher)|John Martin]]'s [[Black Sparrow Press]] (now [[HarperCollins]]/[[Ecco Press]]) as collected volumes of his work.\n\nIn 1986 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called Bukowski a \"laureate of American lowlife\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961603-2,00.html|title=Celebrities Who Travel Well|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=June 16, 1986|accessdate=April 28, 2010|first=Pico|last=Iyer}}</ref> Regarding Bukowski's enduring popular appeal, [[Adam Kirsch]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote, \"the secret of Bukowski's appeal ...

However, given the crippling reparations being required of Germany, which led to a stagnant economy and high levels of inflation, Henry Bukowski was unable to make a living, so he decided to move the family to the United States. On April 23, 1923, they sailed from [[Bremerhaven]] to [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], where they settled.\n\nThe family moved to [[Mid-City, Los Angeles]], US <ref>https://la.curbed.com/2015/5/26/9956946/charles-bukowski-childhood-home</ref> in 1930, the city where Charles Bukowski's father and grandfather had previously worked and lived.<ref name=\"Miles\" /><ref name=Sounes8 /> Young Charles spoke English with a strong German accent and was taunted by his childhood playmates with the epithet \"Heini,\" German diminutive of Heinrich, in his early youth. In the 1930s the poet's father was often unemployed. In the autobiographical ''[[Ham on Rye]]'' Charles Bukowski says that, with his mother's acquiescence, his father was frequently abusive, both physically and mentally, beating his son for the smallest imagined offense.<ref name=\"hor\">{{cite book|last=Bukowski|first=Charles|title=Ham on Rye|year=1982|publisher=Ecco|isbn=0-06-117758-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/hamonryenovel0000buko}}</ref><ref name=\"Found\">{{cite web|last=Young |first=Molly |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/charles-bukowski |title=Poetry Foundation of America.

In ''Bukowski: Born Into This'', a 2003 film, Bukowski states that his father beat him with a [[razor strop]] three times a week from the ages of six to 11 years. He says that it helped his writing, as he came to understand undeserved pain. The depression bolstered his rage as he grew, and gave him much of his voice and material for his writings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charles Bukowski 1920\u201394|publisher=Routlage}}</ref>{{verification needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn his early teen years, Bukowski had an epiphany when he was introduced to alcohol by his loyal friend William \"Baldy\" Mullinax, depicted as \"Eli LaCrosse\" in ''Ham on Rye'', son of an alcoholic surgeon. \"This [alcohol] is going to help me for a very long time,\" he later wrote, describing a method (drinking) he could use to come to more amicable terms with his own life.<ref name=\"hor\" /> After graduating from [[Los Angeles High School]], Bukowski attended [[Los Angeles City College]] for two years, taking courses in art, journalism, and literature, before quitting at the start of [[World War II]]. He then moved to [[New York City|New York]] to begin a career as a financially pinched blue-collar worker with dreams of becoming a writer.<ref name=\"Found\" />\n\nOn July 22, 1944, with World War II ongoing, Bukowski was arrested by [[F.B.I.]] agents in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], where he lived at the time, on suspicion of [[draft evasion]]. At a time when the United States was at war with Germany and many Germans and German-Americans in the United States were suspected of disloyalty, his German birth troubled the US authorities. He was held for 17 days in Philadelphia's [[Moyamensing Prison]]. Sixteen days later, he failed a psychological examination that was part of his mandatory military entrance physical test and was given a [[Selective Service]] Classification of [[Class 1-A|4-F]] (unfit for military service).\n\n=== Early writing ===\nWhen Bukowski was 24, his short story \"Aftermath of a Lengthy Rejection Slip\" was published in ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine. Two years later, another short story, \"20 Tanks from Kasseldown\", was published by the [[Black Sun Press]] in Issue III of ''[[Portfolio: An Intercontinental Quarterly]]'', a limited-run, loose-leaf broadside collection printed in 1946 and edited by [[Caresse Crosby]]. Failing to break into the literary world, Bukowski grew disillusioned with the publication process and quit writing for almost a decade, a time that he referred to as a \"ten-year drunk\". These \"lost years\" formed the basis for his later semiautobiographical chronicles, and there are fictionalized versions of Bukowski's life through his highly stylized alter-ego, Henry Chinaski.<ref name=\"Bukowski, Charles\" />\n\nDuring part of this period he continued living in Los Angeles, working at a pickle factory for a short time but also spending some time roaming about the United States, working sporadically and staying in cheap [[rooming house]]s.<ref name=Miles />\n\nIn the early 1950s, Bukowski took a job as a fill-in [[letter carrier]] with the [[United States Post Office Department]] in Los Angeles, but resigned just before he reached three years' service.\n\nIn 1955 he was treated for a near-fatal bleeding ulcer. After leaving the hospital he began to write poetry.<ref name=Miles /> In 1955 he agreed to marry small-town Texas poet Barbara Frye, but they divorced in 1958. According to [[Howard Sounes]]'s ''[[Charles Bukowski: Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life]]'', she later died under mysterious circumstances in [[India]]. Following his divorce, Bukowski resumed drinking and continued writing poetry.<ref name=\"Miles\" />\n\nSeveral of his poems were published in the late 1950s in ''Gallows'', a small poetry magazine published briefly (the magazine lasted for two issues) by Jon Griffith.<ref>''\"Sheaf, Hearse, Coffin, Poetry NOW\"'' by E.V. Griffith (Hearse Press, 1996), pp. 23</ref>\n\nThe small ''[[avant-garde]]'' [[literary magazine]] ''[[Nomad (magazine)|Nomad]]'', published by [[Anthony Linick]] and Donald Factor (the son of [[Max Factor Jr.]]), offered a home to Bukowski's early work. ''Nomad''{{'}}s inaugural issue in 1959 featured two of his poems. A year later, ''Nomad'' published one of Bukowski's best known essays, ''Manifesto: A Call for Our Own Critics''.<ref>Debritto (2013), p.90.</ref>\n\n=== 1960s ===\nBy 1960, Bukowski had returned to the post office in Los Angeles where he began work as a letter filing clerk, a position he held for more than a decade. In 1962, he was distraught over the death of Jane Cooney Baker, his first serious girlfriend. Bukowski turned his inner devastation into a series of poems and stories lamenting her death. In 1964 a daughter, Marina Louise Bukowski, was born to Bukowski and his live-in girlfriend [[FrancEyE|Frances Smith]], whom he referred to as a \"white-haired [[hippie]]\", \"shack-job\", and \"old snaggle-tooth\".<ref>Bukowski, Charles ''Run with the hunted: a Charles Bukowski reader'', Edited by John Martin (Ecco, 2003), pp. 363-365</ref>\n\nE.V. Griffith, editor of Hearse Press, published Bukowski's first separately printed publication, a broadside titled \u201cHis Wife, the Painter,\u201d in June 1960. This event was followed by Hearse Press's publication of \u201cFlower, Fist and Bestial Wail,\u201d Bukowski's first [[chapbook]] of poems, in October, 1960.\n[[File:Bukowski Court, 5124 DeLongpre Avenue, Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|5124 DeLongpre Avenue, Los Angeles, now Bukowski Court, where Bukowski resided from 1963 to 1972]]\n\u201cHis Wife, the Painter\u201d and three other broadsides (\u201cThe Paper on the Floor\u201d, \u201cThe Old Man on the Corner\u201d and \u201cWaste Basket\u201d) formed the centerpiece of Hearse Press's \u201cCoffin 1,\u201d an innovative small-poetry publication consisting of a pocketed folder containing 42 broadsides and lithographs which was published in 1964. Hearse Press continued to publish poems by Bukowski through the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s.<ref>''\"Sheaf, Hearse, Coffin, Poetry NOW\"'' by E.V. Griffith (Hearse Press, 1996), pp. 30, 32</ref>\n\nJon and Louise Webb, publishers of ''[[The Outsider (magazine)|The Outsider]]'' literary magazine, featured some of Bukowski's poetry in its pages. Under the Loujon Press imprint, the Webbs published Bukowski's ''It Catches My Heart in Its Hands'' in 1963 and ''Crucifix in a Deathhand'' in 1965.\n\nBeginning in 1967, Bukowski wrote the column \"[[Notes of a Dirty Old Man]]\" for Los Angeles' ''[[Open City (newspaper)|Open City]]'', an underground newspaper. When ''Open City'' was shut down in 1969, the column was picked up by the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]'' as well as the hippie underground paper ''[[NOLA Express]]'' in [[New Orleans]]. In 1969 Bukowski and [[Neeli Cherkovski]] launched their own short-lived [[mimeograph]]ed literary magazine, ''[[Laugh Literary and Man the Humping Guns]]''. They produced three issues over the next two years.\n\n=== Black Sparrow years ===\nIn 1969 Bukowski accepted an offer from legendary [[Black Sparrow Press]] publisher [[John Martin (publisher)|John Martin]] and quit his post office job to dedicate himself to full-time writing. He was then 49 years old. As he explained in a letter at the time, \"I have one of two choices \u2013 stay in the post office and go crazy ... or stay out here and play at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.\"<ref name=buktro>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaydougherty.com/bukowski/index.html |title=''Introduction to Charles Bukowski'' by Jay Dougherty |publisher=Jaydougherty.com |date=1920-08-16 |accessdate=2014-07-17}}</ref> Less than one month after leaving the postal service he finished his first novel, ''[[Post Office (novel)|Post Office]]''. As a measure of respect for Martin's financial support and faith in a relatively unknown writer, Bukowski published almost all of his subsequent major works with Black Sparrow Press, which became a highly successful enterprise owing to Martin's business acumen and editorial skills.  An avid supporter of small independent presses, Bukowski continued to submit poems and short stories to innumerable small publications throughout his career.<ref name=\"Found\" />\n\nBukowski embarked on a series of love affairs and one-night trysts. One of these relationships was with [[Linda King]], a poet and sculptress. Critic [[Robert Peters (playwright)|Robert Peters]] reported seeing the poet as actor in Linda King's play ''Only a Tenant'', in which she and Bukowski stage-read the first act at the Pasadena Museum of the Artist. This was a one-off performance of what was a shambolic work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/criticism/bukowski-charles-19201994/11/|title=Charles Bukowski \u2013 Criticism|work=[[BookRags]]}}</ref> His other affairs were with a recording executive and a twenty-three-year-old redhead; he wrote a book of poetry as a tribute to his love for the latter, titled, \"Scarlet\" (Black Sparrow Press, 1976). His various affairs and relationships provided material for his stories and poems. Another important relationship was with \"Tanya\", pseudonym of \"Amber O'Neil\" (also a pseudonym), described in Bukowski's \"Women\" as a pen-pal that evolved into a week-end tryst at Bukowski's residence in Los Angeles in the 1970s. \"Amber O'Neil\" later self-published a chapbook about the affair entitled \"Blowing My Hero\".<ref>Sounes, Howard. ''Charles Bukowski: Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life''. Grove Press, 1998. 275.</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Bukowski met Linda Lee Beighle, a health food restaurant owner, rock-and-roll groupie, aspiring actress, heiress to a small Philadelphia \"Main Line\" fortune and devotee of [[Meher Baba]].

His gravestone reads: \"Don't Try\", a phrase which Bukowski uses in one of his poems, advising aspiring writers and poets about inspiration and creativity. Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to [[John William Corrington]]: \"Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How do you write, create?' You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: ''not'' to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or, if you like its looks, you make a pet out of it.\"\n\nBukowski was an atheist.<ref>\"For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are answered. But for those of us who can't readily accept the God formula, the big answers don't remain stone-written. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command or faith a dictum. I am my own God. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state and our education system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.\"--Charles Bukowski, Life (magazine), December 1988, quoted from James A. Haught, ed, ''2000 Years of Disbelief''.</ref>\n\nBukowski's work was subject to controversy throughout his career, and [[Hugh Fox]] claimed that his sexism in poetry, at least in part, translated into his life. In 1969, Fox published the first critical study of Bukowski in [[North American Review|The North American Review]], and mentioned Bukowski's attitude toward women: \"When women are around, he has to play Man. In a way it's the same kind of 'pose' he plays at in his poetry\u2014[[Humphrey Bogart|Bogart]], [[Erich von Stroheim|Eric Von Stroheim]]. Whenever my wife Lucia would come with me to visit him he'd play the Man role, but one night she couldn't come I got to Buk's place and found a whole different guy\u2014easy to get along with, relaxed, accessible.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Hugh|title=Hugh Fox: The Living Underground: Charles Bukowski|jstor=25117001|journal=The North American Review|volume=254|issue=3|pages=57\u201358|year=1969}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2006, Bukowski's literary archive was donated by his widow to the [[Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino, California]]. Copies of all editions of his work published by the Black Sparrow Press are held at [[Western Michigan University]], which purchased the archive of the publishing house after its closure in 2003.\n\n[[Ecco Press]] continues to release new collections of his poetry, culled from the thousands of works published in small literary magazines.

In a 1974 interview he said, \"You live in a town all your life, and you get to know every bitch on the street corner and half of them you have already messed around with. You've got the layout of the whole land. You have a picture of where you are.... Since I was raised in L.A., I've always had the geographical and spiritual feeling of being here. I've had time to learn this city.

Drinking was often a featured part of the readings, along with a combative banter with the audience.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bukowskilive.com/riot_pur.htm |title=Excerpt from letter from Bukowski to Carl Weissner \u2013 included in \"\"Living on Luck Selected Letters 1960s \u2013 1970s Volume 2\"\", page 276 |publisher=Bukowskilive.com |accessdate=2014-07-17 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707070304/http://bukowskilive.com/riot_pur.htm |archive-date=2012-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bukowski could also be generous, for example, after a sold-out show at [[Amazingrace Coffeehouse]] in Evanston, Illinois on Nov. 18, 1975, he signed and illustrated over 100 copies of his poem \"Winter,\" published by [[No Mountains Poetry Project]].

As noted by one reviewer, \"Bukowski continued to be, thanks to his antics and deliberate clownish performances, the king of the underground and the epitome of the littles in the ensuing decades, stressing his loyalty to those small press editors who had first championed his work and consolidating his presence in new ventures such as the ''[[New York Quarterly]]'', ''[[Chiron Review]]'', or ''[[Slipstream Magazine|Slipstream]]''.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/Charles-Bukowski-King-of-the-Underground/?K=9781137343543 |title=Charles Bukowski, King of the Underground From Obscurity to Literary Icon |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}</ref> Some of these works include his ''Poems Written Before Jumping Out of an 8 Story Window'', published by his friend and fellow poet [[Charles Potts]], and better known works such as ''Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame''. These poems and stories were later republished by [[John Martin (publisher)|John Martin]]'s [[Black Sparrow Press]] (now [[HarperCollins]]/[[Ecco Press]]) as collected volumes of his work.\n\nIn 1986 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called Bukowski a \"laureate of American lowlife\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961603-2,00.html|title=Celebrities Who Travel Well|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=June 16, 1986|accessdate=April 28, 2010|first=Pico|last=Iyer}}</ref> Regarding Bukowski's enduring popular appeal, [[Adam Kirsch]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote, \"the secret of Bukowski's appeal ...

In contrast, Bukowski enjoyed extraordinary fame in Europe, especially in Germany, the place of his birth.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Family and early years ===\n[[File:Bukowski Geburtshaus.jpg|thumb|upright|Bukowski's birthplace at Aktienstrasse, [[Andernach]]]]\nBukowski was born Heinrich Karl Bukowski ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ha\u026an\u0281\u026a\u00e7 \u02c8ka\u0250\u032fl bu\u02c8k\u0254fski|lang}}) in [[Andernach]], [[Rhine Province]], [[Prussia]], [[Weimar Republic]] (present-day [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Germany]]) to Heinrich (Henry) Bukowski, a German-American in the [[Occupation of the Rhineland#American forces in Germany (1918\u20131923)|U.S. army of occupation]] after [[World War I]] who remained in Germany after his army service, and Katharina (n\u00e9e Fett).

In [[Cleveland]], Leonard met Emilie Krause, an ethnic German, who had emigrated from [[Danzig]], [[Prussia]] (today [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Poland]]).

The poet's father was German-American and a sergeant in the [[United States Army]] serving in Germany following Germany's defeat in 1918.<ref name=\"Miles\" /> He had an affair with Katharina, a German friend's sister, and she became pregnant.

Charles Bukowski: Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life, p. 8</ref> Afterwards, Henry Bukowski became a building contractor, set to make great financial gains in the aftermath of the war, and after two years moved the family to Pfaffendorf (today part of [[Koblenz]]). However, given the crippling reparations being required of Germany, which led to a stagnant economy and high levels of inflation, Henry Bukowski was unable to make a living, so he decided to move the family to the United States. On April 23, 1923, they sailed from [[Bremerhaven]] to [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], where they settled.\n\nThe family moved to [[Mid-City, Los Angeles]], US <ref>https://la.curbed.com/2015/5/26/9956946/charles-bukowski-childhood-home</ref> in 1930, the city where Charles Bukowski's father and grandfather had previously worked and lived.<ref name=\"Miles\" /><ref name=Sounes8 /> Young Charles spoke English with a strong German accent and was taunted by his childhood playmates with the epithet \"Heini,\" German diminutive of Heinrich, in his early youth. In the 1930s the poet's father was often unemployed. In the autobiographical ''[[Ham on Rye]]'' Charles Bukowski says that, with his mother's acquiescence, his father was frequently abusive, both physically and mentally, beating his son for the smallest imagined offense.<ref name=\"hor\">{{cite book|last=Bukowski|first=Charles|title=Ham on Rye|year=1982|publisher=Ecco|isbn=0-06-117758-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/hamonryenovel0000buko}}</ref><ref name=\"Found\">{{cite web|last=Young |first=Molly |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/charles-bukowski |title=Poetry Foundation of America.

In ''Bukowski: Born Into This'', a 2003 film, Bukowski states that his father beat him with a [[razor strop]] three times a week from the ages of six to 11 years. He says that it helped his writing, as he came to understand undeserved pain. The depression bolstered his rage as he grew, and gave him much of his voice and material for his writings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charles Bukowski 1920\u201394|publisher=Routlage}}</ref>{{verification needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn his early teen years, Bukowski had an epiphany when he was introduced to alcohol by his loyal friend William \"Baldy\" Mullinax, depicted as \"Eli LaCrosse\" in ''Ham on Rye'', son of an alcoholic surgeon. \"This [alcohol] is going to help me for a very long time,\" he later wrote, describing a method (drinking) he could use to come to more amicable terms with his own life.<ref name=\"hor\" /> After graduating from [[Los Angeles High School]], Bukowski attended [[Los Angeles City College]] for two years, taking courses in art, journalism, and literature, before quitting at the start of [[World War II]]. He then moved to [[New York City|New York]] to begin a career as a financially pinched blue-collar worker with dreams of becoming a writer.<ref name=\"Found\" />\n\nOn July 22, 1944, with World War II ongoing, Bukowski was arrested by [[F.B.I.]] agents in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], where he lived at the time, on suspicion of [[draft evasion]]. His German birth was troubling at a time when the United States was at war with Germany and many Germans and German-Americans in the United States were suspected of disloyalty. He was held for 17 days in Philadelphia's [[Moyamensing Prison]]. Sixteen days later, he failed a psychological examination that was part of his mandatory military entrance physical test and was given a [[Selective Service]] Classification of [[Class 1-A|4-F]] (unfit for military service).\n\n=== Early writing ===\nWhen Bukowski was 24, his short story \"Aftermath of a Lengthy Rejection Slip\" was published in ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine. Two years later, another short story, \"20 Tanks from Kasseldown\", was published by the [[Black Sun Press]] in Issue III of ''[[Portfolio: An Intercontinental Quarterly]]'', a limited-run, loose-leaf broadside collection printed in 1946 and edited by [[Caresse Crosby]]. Failing to break into the literary world, Bukowski grew disillusioned with the publication process and quit writing for almost a decade, a time that he referred to as a \"ten-year drunk\". These \"lost years\" formed the basis for his later semiautobiographical chronicles, and there are fictionalized versions of Bukowski's life through his highly stylized alter-ego, Henry Chinaski.<ref name=\"Bukowski, Charles\" />\n\nDuring part of this period he continued living in Los Angeles, working at a pickle factory for a short time but also spending some time roaming about the United States, working sporadically and staying in cheap [[rooming house]]s.<ref name=Miles />\n\nIn the early 1950s, Bukowski took a job as a fill-in [[letter carrier]] with the [[United States Post Office Department]] in Los Angeles, but resigned just before he reached three years' service.\n\nIn 1955 he was treated for a near-fatal bleeding ulcer. After leaving the hospital he began to write poetry.<ref name=Miles /> In 1955 he agreed to marry small-town Texas poet Barbara Frye, but they divorced in 1958. According to [[Howard Sounes]]'s ''[[Charles Bukowski: Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life]]'', she later died under mysterious circumstances in [[India]]. Following his divorce, Bukowski resumed drinking and continued writing poetry.<ref name=\"Miles\" />\n\nSeveral of his poems were published in the late 1950s in ''Gallows'', a small poetry magazine published briefly (the magazine lasted for two issues) by Jon Griffith.<ref>''\"Sheaf, Hearse, Coffin, Poetry NOW\"'' by E.V. Griffith (Hearse Press, 1996), pp. 23</ref>\n\nThe small ''[[avant-garde]]'' [[literary magazine]] ''[[Nomad (magazine)|Nomad]]'', published by [[Anthony Linick]] and Donald Factor (the son of [[Max Factor Jr.]]), offered a home to Bukowski's early work. ''Nomad''{{'}}s inaugural issue in 1959 featured two of his poems. A year later, ''Nomad'' published one of Bukowski's best known essays, ''Manifesto: A Call for Our Own Critics''.<ref>Debritto (2013), p.90.</ref>\n\n=== 1960s ===\nBy 1960, Bukowski had returned to the post office in Los Angeles where he began work as a letter filing clerk, a position he held for more than a decade. In 1962, he was distraught over the death of Jane Cooney Baker, his first serious girlfriend. Bukowski turned his inner devastation into a series of poems and stories lamenting her death. In 1964 a daughter, Marina Louise Bukowski, was born to Bukowski and his live-in girlfriend [[FrancEyE|Frances Smith]], whom he referred to as a \"white-haired [[hippie]]\", \"shack-job\", and \"old snaggle-tooth\".<ref>Bukowski, Charles ''Run with the hunted: a Charles Bukowski reader'', Edited by John Martin (Ecco, 2003), pp. 363-365</ref>\n\nE.V. Griffith, editor of Hearse Press, published Bukowski's first separately printed publication, a broadside titled \u201cHis Wife, the Painter,\u201d in June 1960. This event was followed by Hearse Press's publication of \u201cFlower, Fist and Bestial Wail,\u201d Bukowski's first [[chapbook]] of poems, in October, 1960.\n[[File:Bukowski Court, 5124 DeLongpre Avenue, Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|5124 DeLongpre Avenue, Los Angeles, now Bukowski Court, where Bukowski resided from 1963 to 1972]]\n\u201cHis Wife, the Painter\u201d and three other broadsides (\u201cThe Paper on the Floor\u201d, \u201cThe Old Man on the Corner\u201d and \u201cWaste Basket\u201d) formed the centerpiece of Hearse Press's \u201cCoffin 1,\u201d an innovative small-poetry publication consisting of a pocketed folder containing 42 broadsides and lithographs which was published in 1964.

Under the Loujon Press imprint, the Webbs published Bukowski's ''It Catches My Heart in Its Hands'' in 1963 and ''Crucifix in a Deathhand'' in 1965.\n\nBeginning in 1967, Bukowski wrote the column \"[[Notes of a Dirty Old Man]]\" for Los Angeles' ''[[Open City (newspaper)|Open City]]'', an underground newspaper. When ''Open City'' was shut down in 1969, the column was picked up by the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]'' as well as the hippie underground paper ''[[NOLA Express]]'' in [[New Orleans]]. In 1969 Bukowski and [[Neeli Cherkovski]] launched their own short-lived [[mimeograph]]ed literary magazine, ''[[Laugh Literary and Man the Humping Guns]]''. They produced three issues over the next two years.\n\n=== Black Sparrow years ===\nIn 1969 Bukowski accepted an offer from legendary [[Black Sparrow Press]] publisher [[John Martin (publisher)|John Martin]] and quit his post office job to dedicate himself to full-time writing. He was then 49 years old. As he explained in a letter at the time, \"I have one of two choices \u2013 stay in the post office and go crazy ... or stay out here and play at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.\"<ref name=buktro>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaydougherty.com/bukowski/index.html |title=''Introduction to Charles Bukowski'' by Jay Dougherty |publisher=Jaydougherty.com |date=1920-08-16 |accessdate=2014-07-17}}</ref> Less than one month after leaving the postal service he finished his first novel, ''[[Post Office (novel)|Post Office]]''. As a measure of respect for Martin's financial support and faith in a relatively unknown writer, Bukowski published almost all of his subsequent major works with Black Sparrow Press, which became a highly successful enterprise owing to Martin's business acumen and editorial skills.  An avid supporter of small independent presses, Bukowski continued to submit poems and short stories to innumerable small publications throughout his career.<ref name=\"Found\" />\n\nBukowski embarked on a series of love affairs and one-night trysts. One of these relationships was with [[Linda King]], a poet and sculptress. Critic [[Robert Peters (playwright)|Robert Peters]] reported seeing the poet as actor in Linda King's play ''Only a Tenant'', in which she and Bukowski stage-read the first act at the Pasadena Museum of the Artist. This was a one-off performance of what was a shambolic work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/criticism/bukowski-charles-19201994/11/|title=Charles Bukowski \u2013 Criticism|work=[[BookRags]]}}</ref> His other affairs were with a recording executive and a twenty-three-year-old redhead; he wrote a book of poetry as a tribute to his love for the latter, titled, \"Scarlet\" (Black Sparrow Press, 1976). His various affairs and relationships provided material for his stories and poems. Another important relationship was with \"Tanya\", pseudonym of \"Amber O'Neil\" (also a pseudonym), described in Bukowski's \"Women\" as a pen-pal that evolved into a week-end tryst at Bukowski's residence in Los Angeles in the 1970s. \"Amber O'Neil\" later self-published a chapbook about the affair entitled \"Blowing My Hero\".<ref>Sounes, Howard.

Beighle followed him and they lived together intermittently over the next two years.

Beighle is referred to as \"Sara\" in Bukowski's novels ''[[Women (Bukowski novel)|Women]]'' and ''[[Hollywood (Bukowski novel)|Hollywood]]''.\n\nIn May, 1978, he returned to Germany and gave a live poetry reading of his work before an audience in [[Hamburg]].

The funeral rites, orchestrated by his widow, were conducted by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks. He is interred at Green Hills Memorial Park in [[Rancho Palos Verdes]]. An account of the proceedings can be found in [[Gerald Locklin]]'s book ''Charles Bukowski: A Sure Bet''. His gravestone reads: \"Don't Try\", a phrase which Bukowski uses in one of his poems, advising aspiring writers and poets about inspiration and creativity. Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to [[John William Corrington]]: \"Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How do you write, create?' You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: ''not'' to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or, if you like its looks, you make a pet out of it.\"\n\nBukowski was an atheist.<ref>\"For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are answered. But for those of us who can't readily accept the God formula, the big answers don't remain stone-written. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command or faith a dictum. I am my own God. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state and our education system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.\"--Charles Bukowski, Life (magazine), December 1988, quoted from James A. Haught, ed, ''2000 Years of Disbelief''.</ref>\n\nBukowski's work was subject to controversy throughout his career, and [[Hugh Fox]] claimed that his sexism in poetry, at least in part, translated into his life. In 1969, Fox published the first critical study of Bukowski in [[North American Review|The North American Review]], and mentioned Bukowski's attitude toward women: \"When women are around, he has to play Man. In a way it's the same kind of 'pose' he plays at in his poetry\u2014[[Humphrey Bogart|Bogart]], [[Erich von Stroheim|Eric Von Stroheim]].

Copies of all editions of his work published by the Black Sparrow Press are held at [[Western Michigan University]], which purchased the archive of the publishing house after its closure in 2003.\n\n[[Ecco Press]] continues to release new collections of his poetry, culled from the thousands of works published in small literary magazines.

In a 1974 interview he said, \"You live in a town all your life, and you get to know every bitch on the street corner and half of them you have already messed around with. You've got the layout of the whole land. You have a picture of where you are.... Since I was raised in L.A., I've always had the geographical and spiritual feeling of being here. I've had time to learn this city. I can't see any other place than L.A.\"<ref name=buktro />\n\nBukowski also performed live readings of his works, beginning in 1962 on radio station [[KPFK]] in Los Angeles and increasing in frequency through the 1970s. Drinking was often a featured part of the readings, along with a combative banter with the audience.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bukowskilive.com/riot_pur.htm |title=Excerpt from letter from Bukowski to Carl Weissner \u2013 included in \"\"Living on Luck Selected Letters 1960s \u2013 1970s Volume 2\"\", page 276 |publisher=Bukowskilive.com |accessdate=2014-07-17 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707070304/http://bukowskilive.com/riot_pur.htm |archive-date=2012-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bukowski could also be generous, for example, after a sold-out show at [[Amazingrace Coffeehouse]] in Evanston, Illinois on Nov. 18, 1975, he signed and illustrated over 100 copies of his poem \"Winter,\" published by [[No Mountains Poetry Project]].
