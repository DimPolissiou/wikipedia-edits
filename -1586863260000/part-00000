For example, the majority of salmon sold in the United States is raised off the coast of Chile, due in large part to less stringent Chilean standards regarding fish feed and regardless of the fact that salmon are not indigenous in Chilean coastal waters.<ref>(2001); Bjorndal, T., \"The Competitiveness of the Chilean Salmon Aquaculture Industry\", Foundation for Research in Economics and Business Administration, Bergen, Norway</ref> The globalization of food production can result in the loss of traditional food systems in [[Developing country|less developed countries]], and have negative impacts on the [[population health]], ecosystems, and [[cultures]] in those countries.<ref>(1996); Kuhnlein, H.V., Receveur, O.; Dietary Change and Traditional Food Systems of Indigenous Peoples; Centre for Nutrition and the Environment of Indigenous Peoples, and School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition, McGill University, Quebec, Canada</ref>\n\n== Sourcing sustainable food ==\n{{Main|sustainable agriculture}}\nAt the global level the environmental impact of agribusiness is being addressed through [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[organic farming]].

This stemmed from an [[List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament to 1707|Act of Parliament]] requiring all [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] clan [[Scottish clan#Inheritance and authority|chiefs]] to prove legal ownership of their land.<ref name=\"keay\">{{cite book|last=Keay|first=John & Julia|title=Collins Encyclopedia of Scotland|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-00-255082-6|page=370}}</ref> \n\nThis head-over-heels legislation exposed many long-held ancestral lands to seizure. The generally title-less lands of the highlands and islands became a target for the more document-conscious Lowlanders. Legally trained nobility were the first to take opportunity of this, creating papers for lands with which they had no historical connection.\n\n==The Re-Colonisation of Lewis==\n\nKing James had the aim of beginning the \"civilising\" or \"de-[[Gaelicisation]]\" of the islands and had much in common with the [[Plantation of Ulster]] which occurred some years later. James regarded the need for civilisation as sufficiently important to employ \"slauchter, mutilation, fyre-raising, or utheris inconvenieties\" if necessary.<ref name=\"haswell-smith\">{{cite book|last=Haswell-Smith|first=Hamish|title=The Scottish Islands|year=1996|publisher=Canongate|isbn=978-0-86241-579-2|pages=240\u2013241}}</ref> In fact, he had initially planned to murder all of the native inhabitants in order to facilitate settlement, but was persuaded to abandon this plan as impractical.<ref>Lenihan, P\u00e1draig. 2008.Consolidating Conquest: Ireland 1603-1727.

This stemmed from an [[List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament to 1707|Act of Parliament]] requiring all [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] clan [[Scottish clan#Inheritance and authority|chiefs]] to prove legal ownership of their land.<ref name=\"keay\">{{cite book|last=Keay|first=John & Julia|title=Collins Encyclopedia of Scotland|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-00-255082-6|page=370}}</ref> \n\nThis head-over-heels legislation exposed many long-held ancestral lands to seizure. The generally title-less lands of the highlands and islands became a target for the more document-conscious Lowlanders. Legally trained nobility were the first to take opportunity of this, creating papers for lands with which they had no historical connection.\n\n==The Re-Colonisation of Lewis==\n\nKing James had the aim of beginning the \"civilising\" or \"de-[[Gaelicisation]]\" of the islands and had much in common with the [[Plantation of Ulster]] which occurred some years later. James regarded the need for civilisation as sufficiently important to employ \"slauchter, mutilation, fyre-raising, or utheris inconvenieties\" if necessary.<ref name=\"haswell-smith\">{{cite book|last=Haswell-Smith|first=Hamish|title=The Scottish Islands|year=1996|publisher=Canongate|isbn=978-0-86241-579-2|pages=240\u2013241}}</ref> In fact, he had initially planned to murder all of the native inhabitants in order to facilitate settlement, but was persuaded to abandon this plan as impractical.<ref>Lenihan, P\u00e1draig. 2008.Consolidating Conquest: Ireland 1603-1727.

In his ''Reflexiones Militares'', published between 1726 and 1730, he discussed how to spot early signs of an incipient insurgency, prevent insurgencies, and counter them, if they could not be warded off. Strikingly, Santa Cruz recognized that insurgencies are usually due to real grievances: \"A state rarely rises up without the fault of its governors.\" Consequently, he advocated clemency towards the population and good governance, to seek the people's \"heart and love\".<ref name=\"test\">Excerpts from Santa Cruz's writings, translated into English, in Beatrice Heuser: ''The Strategy Makers: Thoughts on War and Society from Machiavelli to Clausewitz'' (Santa Monica, CA: Greenwood/Praeger, 2010), {{ISBN|978-0-275-99826-4}}, pp. 124-146.</ref>\n\n===B. H. Liddell Hart===\nThe majority of counter-insurgency efforts by major powers in the last century have been spectacularly unsuccessful. This may be attributed to a number of causes. First, as [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] pointed out in the Insurgency addendum to the second version of his book ''[[Strategy: The Indirect Approach]]'', a popular insurgency has an inherent advantage over any occupying force. He showed as a prime example the [[Peninsular War|French occupation of Spain]] during the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Whenever Spanish forces managed to constitute themselves into a regular fighting force, the superior French forces beat them every time.\n\nHowever, once dispersed and decentralized, the [[irregular warfare|irregular nature]] of the rebel campaigns proved a decisive counter to French superiority on the battlefield. [[Napoleon]]'s army had no means of effectively combatting the rebels, and in the end their strength and morale were so sapped that when [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] was finally able to challenge French forces in the field, the French had almost no choice but to abandon the situation.\n\nCounter-insurgency efforts may be successful, especially when the insurgents are unpopular. The [[Philippine\u2013American War]], the [[Shining Path]] in Peru, and the [[Malayan Emergency]] in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] have been the sites of failed insurgencies.\n\nHart also points to the experiences of [[T. E. Lawrence]] and the [[Arab Revolt]] during [[World War I]] as another example of the power of the rebel/insurgent. Though the [[Ottomans]] often had advantages in manpower of more than 100 to 1, the [[Arab]]s' ability to materialize out of the desert, strike, and disappear again often left the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] reeling and paralyzed, creating an opportunity for regular [[British forces]] to sweep in and finish the Turkish forces off.\n\nIn both the preceding cases, the insurgents and rebel fighters were working in conjunction with or in a manner complementary to regular forces. Such was also the case with the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]] and the [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front]] during the Vietnam War. The strategy in these cases is for the irregular combatant to weaken and destabilize the enemy to such a degree that victory is easy or assured for the regular forces. However, in many modern rebellions, one does not see rebel fighters working in conjunction with regular forces. Rather, they are home-grown [[militia]]s or imported fighters who have no unified goals or objectives save to expel the occupier.\n\nAccording to Liddell Hart, there are few effective counter-measures to this strategy. So long as the insurgency maintains popular support, it will retain all of its strategic advantages of mobility, invisibility, and legitimacy in its own eyes and the eyes of the people. So long as this is the situation, an insurgency essentially cannot be defeated by regular forces.\n\nAnother option in combating an insurgency would be to make the presence of troops so pervasive that there is simply no place left for insurgents to hide, as demonstrated in [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s conquest of [[Republican Spain]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] or the Union occupation of [[Confederate States]] with Federal troops following the [[American Civil War]]. In each of these cases, enormous amounts of manpower were needed for an extended period to quell resistance over almost every square kilometre of territory. In an age of ever shrinking and increasingly computerized armed forces, this option too is precluded from a modern commander's options.\n\nEssentially, then, only one viable option remains. The key to a successful counter-insurgency is the winning-over of the occupied territory's population. If that can be achieved, then the rebellion will be deprived of its supplies, shelter, and, more importantly, its moral legitimacy. Unless the [[Hearts and minds (concept)|hearts and minds]] of the public can be separated from the insurgency, the occupation is doomed to fail. In a modern [[representative democracy]], in the face of perceived incessant losses, no conflict will be tolerated by an electorate without significant show of tangible gains.\n\n* '''Vietnam War'''\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], counter-insurgency initially formed part of the earlier war as Diem had implemented the poorly conceived [[strategic Hamlet Program]], a similar model to the Malayan Emergency whom had opposite effects. Similarly economic and rural development formed a key strategy as part of Rural Affairs development.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.afsa.org/counterinsurgency-vietnam-lessons-today|title=Counterinsurgency in Vietnam: Lessons for Today - The Foreign Service Journal - April 2015|author=|date=|website=www.afsa.org}}</ref> While the earlier war was marked by considerable emphasis on counter-insurgency programs US forces initially relied on very little if any theoretical doctrine of counter-insurgency during the [[Joint warfare in South Vietnam, 1963\u201369]] phase. This was more or less a failing strategy on the part of the United States, as conventional means were applied in direct contradiction to the wisdom of counter-insurgency. \n\n* '''Current situations'''\nIn these cases, such as the [[Israeli occupation of Lebanon]], which ended in 2000, and the recent [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]], the goal of the insurgent is not to defeat the occupying military force; that is almost always an impossible task given the disparity in resources. Rather, they seek through a constant campaign of sneak attacks to inflict continuous casualties upon their superior enemy forces and thereby over time demoralize the occupying forces and erode political support for the occupation in the homeland of the occupying forces. It is a simple strategy of repeated pin-pricks and bleeding that, though small in proportion to the total force strength, sap the will of the occupier to continue the fight.\n\n===David Galula===\n[[David Galula]] gained his practical experience in counter-insurgency as a French officer in the [[Algerian War]]. His theory of counterinsurgency is not primarily military, but a combination of military, political and social actions under the strong control of a single authority.\n\nGalula proposes four \"laws\" for counterinsurgency:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crinfo.org/booksummary/10672/ |author=Reeder, Brett |title=Book Summary of Counterinsurgency Warfare: Theory and Practice by David Galula |publisher=Crinfo.org (The Conflict Resolution Information Source) |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref>\n\n# The aim of the war is to gain the support of the population rather than control of territory.\n# Most of the population will be neutral in the conflict; support of the masses can be obtained with the help of an active friendly minority.\n# Support of the population may be lost. The population must be efficiently protected to allow it to cooperate without fear of retribution by the opposite party.\n# Order enforcement should be done progressively by removing or driving away armed opponents, then gaining support of the population, and eventually strengthening positions by building infrastructure and setting long-term relationships with the population. This must be done area by area, using a pacified territory as a basis of operation to conquer a neighboring area.\n\nGalula contends that:\n{{quote|A victory [in a counterinsurgency] is not the destruction in a given area of the insurgent's forces and his political organization. ... A victory is that plus the permanent isolation of the insurgent from the population, isolation not enforced upon the population, but maintained by and with the population. ... In conventional warfare, strength is assessed according to military or other tangible criteria, such as the number of divisions, the position they hold, the industrial resources, etc. In revolutionary warfare, strength must be assessed by the extent of support from the population as measured in terms of political organization at the grass roots. The counterinsurgent reaches a position of strength when his power is embedded in a political organization issuing from, and firmly supported by, the population.<ref name=galula />}}\n\nWith his four principles in mind, Galula goes on to describe a general military and political strategy to put them into operation in an area that is under full insurgent control:\n\n{{Quote|In a Selected Area<br>\n1. Concentrate enough armed forces to destroy or to expel the main body of armed insurgents.<br>\n2. Detach for the area sufficient troops to oppose an insurgent's comeback in strength, install these troops in the hamlets, villages, and towns where the population lives.<br>\n3. Establish contact with the population, control its movements in order to cut off its links with the guerrillas.<br>\n4. Destroy the local insurgent political organization.<br>\n5. Set up, by means of elections, new provisional local authorities.<br>\n6. Test those authorities by assigning them various concrete tasks. Replace the softs and the incompetents, give full support to the active leaders. Organize self-defense units.<br>\n7. Group and educate the leaders in a national political movement.<br>\n8.

Thompson outlines five basic principles for a successful counter-insurgency:\n\n# The government must have a clear political aim: to establish and maintain a free, independent and united country which is politically and economically stable and viable;\n# The government must function in accordance with the law;\n# The government must have an overall plan;\n# The government must give priority to defeating political subversion, not the guerrillas;\n# In the guerrilla phase of an insurgency, a government must secure its base areas first.<ref name=\"Hamilton1998\">{{cite book | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = Donald W. | title = The art of insurgency: American military policy and the failure of strategy in Southeast Asia | publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group]] | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-275-95734-6}}</ref>\n\n===David Kilcullen===\n[[File:Kilcullen3Pillars.svg|thumb|right|350px|Three Pillars of Counterinsurgency]]\n\nIn \"The Three Pillars of Counterinsurgency\", Dr. [[David Kilcullen]], the Chief Strategist of the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism of the [[U.S. State Department]] in 2006, described a framework for interagency cooperation in counterinsurgency operations. His pillars \u2013 Security, Political and Economic \u2013 support the overarching goal of Control, but are based on Information:\n\n{{quote|This is because perception is crucial in developing control and influence over population groups. Substantive security, political and economic measures are critical but to be effective they must rest upon, and integrate with a broader information strategy. Every action in counterinsurgency sends a message; the purpose of the information campaign is to consolidate and unify this message. ... Importantly, the information campaign has to be conducted at a global, regional and local level \u2014 because modern insurgents draw upon global networks of sympathy, support, funding and recruitment.<ref name=kilcullen>{{cite web| url = http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/uscoin/3pillars_of_counterinsurgency.pdf | title = Three Pillars of Counterinsurgency| first = David | last = Kilcullen | authorlink = David Kilcullen | conference = U.S. Government Counterinsurgency Conference, Washington D.C. | date =28 September 2006}}</ref>}}\n\nKilcullen considers the three pillars to be of equal importance, because\n{{quote|unless they are developed in parallel, the campaign becomes unbalanced: too much economic assistance with inadequate security, for example, simply creates an array of soft targets for the insurgents.

In each case, we seek not only to establish control, but also to consolidate that control and then transfer it to permanent, effective and legitimate institutions.\"<ref name=kilcullen />\n\n===Martin van Creveld===\nMilitary historian [[Martin van Creveld]], noting that almost all attempts to deal with insurgency have ended in failure, advises:\n{{quote|The first, and absolutely indispensable, thing to do is throw overboard 99 percent of the literature on counterinsurgency, counterguerrilla, counterterrorism, and the like. Since most of it was written by the losing side, it is of little value.<ref>van Creveld, p. 268</ref>}}\n\nIn examining why so many counterinsurgencies by powerful militaries fail against weaker enemies, Van Creveld identifies a key dynamic that he illustrates by the metaphor of killing a child. Regardless of whether the child started the fight or how well armed the child is, an adult in a fight with a child will feel that he is acting unjustly if he harms the child and foolish if the child harms him; he will therefore wonder if the fight is necessary.\n\nVan Creveld argues that \"by definition, a strong counterinsurgent who uses his strength to kill the members of a small, weak organization of insurgents \u2013 let alone the civilian population by which it is surrounded, and which may lend it support \u2013 will commit crimes in an unjust cause,\" while \"a child who is in a serious fight with an adult is justified in using every and any means available \u2013 not because he or she is right, but because he or she has no choice.\"<ref>van Creveld, p. 226</ref> Every act of insurgency becomes, from the perspective of the counterinsurgent, a reason to end the conflict, while also being a reason for the insurgents to continue until victory. [[Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh]], second in command to [[Ho Chi Minh]] of [[Vietnam]], wrote in his ''Primer for Revolt'':\n{{Quote|The guiding principle of the strategy for our whole resistance must be to prolong the war. To protract the war is the key to victory. Why must the war be protracted? ... If we throw the whole of our forces into a few battles to try to decide the outcome, we shall certainly be defeated and the enemy will win. On the other hand, if while fighting we maintain our forces, expand them, train our army and people, learn military tactics ... and at the same time wear down the enemy forces, we shall weary and discourage them in such a way that, strong as they are, they will become weak and will meet defeat instead of victory.<ref>van Creveld, pp. 229-230</ref>}}\n\nVan Creveld thus identifies \"time\" as the key factor in counterinsurgency. In an attempt to find lessons from the few cases of successful counterinsurgency, of which he lists two clear cases: the British efforts during [[The Troubles]] of [[Northern Ireland]] and the 1982 [[Hama massacre]] carried out by the [[Syria]]n government to suppress the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], he asserts that the \"core of the difficulty is neither military nor political, but moral\" and outlines two distinct methods.<ref>van Creveld, p. 269</ref>\n\nThe first method relies on superb intelligence, provided by those who know the natural and artificial environment of the conflict as well as the insurgents. Once such superior intelligence is gained, the counterinsurgents must be trained to a point of high professionalism and discipline such that they will exercise discrimination and restraint. Through such discrimination and restraint, the counterinsurgents do not alienate members of the populace besides those already fighting them, while delaying the time when the counterinsurgents become disgusted by their own actions and demoralized.\n\nGeneral Patrick Walters, British commander of troops in northern Ireland, explicitly stated that his objective was not to kill as many terrorists as possible, but to ensure that as few people on both sides were killed. In the vast majority of counterinsurgencies, the \"forces of order\" kill far more people than they lose. In contrast and using very rough figures, the struggle in Northern Ireland had cost the United Kingdom three thousand casualties in dead alone. Of the three thousand, about seventeen hundred were civilians...of the remaining, a thousand were British soldiers. No more than three hundred were terrorists, a ratio of three to one.<ref name=\"van Creveld, 235\">van Creveld, p. 235</ref>\n\nIf the prerequisites for the first method \u2013 excellent intelligence, superbly trained and disciplined soldiers and police, and an iron will to avoid being provoked into lashing out \u2013 are lacking, van Creveld posits that counterinsurgents who still want to win must use the second method exemplified by the [[Hama massacre]]. In 1982 the regime of Syrian president [[Hafez al-Assad]] was on the point of being overwhelmed by the countrywide insurgency of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. al-Assad sent a division under his brother [[Rifaat al-Assad|Rifaat]] to the city of [[Hama]], known to be the center of the resistance.\n\nFollowing a counterattack by the Brotherhood, Rifaat used his heavy artillery to demolish the city, killing between ten and 25 thousand people, including many women and children. Asked by reporters what had happened, Hafez al-Assad exaggerated the damage and deaths, promoted the commanders who carried out the attacks, and razed Hama's well-known great mosque, replacing it with a parking lot. With the Muslim Brotherhood scattered, the population was so cowed that it would be years before opposition groups dared to disobey the regime again and, van Creveld argues, the massacre most likely saved the regime and prevented a bloody [[civil war]].\n\nVan Creveld condenses al-Assad's strategy into five rules, while noting that they could easily have been written by [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]:<ref name=\"van Creveld, 235\"/>\n# There are situations in which cruelty is necessary, and refusing to apply necessary cruelty is a betrayal of the people who put you into power. When pressed to cruelty, never threaten your opponent but disguise your intention and feign weakness until you strike.\n# Once you decide to strike, it is better to kill too many than not enough. If another strike is needed, it reduces the impact of the first strike. Repeated strikes will also endanger the morale of the counterinsurgent troops; soldiers forced to commit repeated atrocities will likely begin to resort to alcohol or drugs to force themselves to carry out orders and will inevitably lose their military edge, eventually turning into a danger to their commanders.\n# Act as soon as possible. More lives will be saved by decisive action early, than by prolonging the insurgency. The longer you wait, the more inured the population will be to bloodshed, and the more barbaric your action will have to be to make an impression.\n# Strike openly. Do not apologize, make excuses about \"[[collateral damage]]\", express regret, or promise investigations. Afterwards, make sure that as many people as possible know of your strike; media is useful for this purpose, but be careful not to let them interview survivors and arouse sympathy.\n# Do not command the strike yourself, in case it doesn't work for some reason and you need to disown your commander and try another strategy. If it does work, present your commander to the world, explain what you have done and make certain that everyone understands that you are ready to strike again.<ref>van Creveld, pp. 241\u2013245</ref>\n\n===Lorenzo Zambernardi===\nIn \"Counterinsurgency\u2019s Impossible Trilemma\", Dr. Lorenzo Zambernardi, an Italian academic now working in the United States, clarifies the tradeoffs involved in counterinsurgency operations.<ref>Zambernardi, Lorenzo, \"Counterinsurgency's Impossible Trilemma\", ''The Washington Quarterly'', 33:3, July 2010, pp. 21-34</ref> He argues that counterinsurgency involves three main goals, but in real practice a counterinsurgent needs to choose two goals out of three. Relying on economic theory, this is what Zambernardi labels the \"impossible trilemma\" of counterinsurgency. Specifically, the impossible trilemma suggests that it is impossible to simultaneously achieve: 1) force protection, 2) distinction between enemy combatants and noncombatants, and 3) the physical elimination of insurgents.\n\nAccording to Zambernardi, in pursuing any two of these three goals, a state must forgo some portion of the third objective. In particular, a state can protect its armed forces while destroying insurgents, but only by indiscriminately killing civilians as the Ottomans, Italians, and Nazis did in the Balkans, Libya, and Eastern Europe. It can choose to protect civilians along with its own armed forces instead, avoiding so-called collateral damage, but only by abandoning the objective of destroying the insurgents. Finally, a state can discriminate between combatants and noncombatants while killing insurgents, but only by increasing the risks for its own troops, because often insurgents will hide behind civilians, or appear to be civilians. So a country must choose two out of three goals and develop a strategy that can successfully accomplish them, while sacrificing the third objective.\n\nZambernardi's theory posits that to protect populations, which is necessary to defeat insurgencies, and to physically destroy an insurgency, the counterinsurgent's military forces must be sacrificed, risking the loss of domestic political support.\n\n===Akali Omeni===\nAnother writer who explores a trio of features relevant to understanding counter-insurgency is Akali Omeni. Within the contemporary context, COIN warfare by African militaries tends to be at the margins of the theoretical debate - even though Africa today is faced with a number of deadly insurgencies. In ''Counter-insurgency in Nigeria'', Omeni, a Nigerian academic, discusses the interactions between certain features away from the battlefield, which account for battlefield performance against insurgent warfare. Specifically, Omeni argues that the trio of historical experience, organisational culture (OC) and doctrine, help explain the institution of COIN within militaries and their tendency to reject the innovation and adaptation often necessary to defeat insurgency. These three features, furthermore, influence and can undermine the operational tactics and concepts adopted against insurgents. The COIN challenge, therefore, is not just operational; it also is cultural and institutional before ever it reflects on the battlefield.\n\nAccording to Omeni, institutional isomorphism is a sociological phenomenon that constrains the habits of a military (in this case, the Nigerian military) to the long-established, yet increasingly ineffective, ideology of the offensive in irregular warfare. As Omeni writes,\n\n<blockquote>Whereas the Nigerian military\u2019s performance against militias in the Niger Delta already suggested the military had a poor grasp of the threat of insurgent warfare; it was further along the line, as the military struggled against Boko Haram\u2019s threat, that the extent of this weakness was exposed. At best, the utility of force, for the Nigerian military, had become but a temporary solution against the threat of insurgent warfare. At worst, the existing model has been perpetuated at such high cost, that urgent revisionist thinking around the idea of counter-insurgency within the military institution may now be required. Additionally, the military\u2019s decisive civil war victory, the pivot in Nigeria\u2019s strategic culture towards a regional role, and the institutional delegitimization brought about by decades of coups and political meddling, meant that much time went by without substantive revisionism to military\u2019s thinking around its internal function. Change moreover, where it occurred, was institutionally isomorphic and not as far removed from the military\u2019s own origins as the intervening decades may have suggested.<ref>Omeni, Akali (2017) ''Counter-insurgency in Nigeria: The Military and Operations Against Boko Haram, 2011-17''. Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge.  pp. 52-53.</ref></blockquote> \n\nFurther, the infantry-centric nature of the Nigerian Army's battalions, traceable all the way back to the Civil War in [[Nigeria]] back in the 1960s, is reflected in the kinetic nature of the Army's contemporary COIN approach.<ref>Omeni, Akali (2018) ''Insurgency and War in Nigeria: Regional Fracture and the Fight Against Boko Haram'' (forthcoming) I.B. Tauris.</ref> This approach has failed to defeat Boko Haram in the way many expected. Certainly, therefore, the popular argument today, which holds that the Nigerian Army has struggled in COIN due to capabilities shortcomings, holds some merit. However, a full-spectrum analysis of the Nigeria case suggests that this popular dominant narrative scarcely scratches the surface of the true COIN challenge. This population-centered challenge, moreover, is one that militaries across the world continue to contend with. And in attempting to solve the COIN puzzle, state forces over the decades have tried a range of tactics.<ref>Omeni, Akali (2017) ''Counter-insurgency in Nigeria: The Military and Operations against Boko Haram, 2011-17''. Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge</ref>\n\n===Information-Centric Theory===\n\nStarting in the early 2000s, micro-level data has transformed analysis of effective counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. Leading this work is the \"information-centric\" group of theorists and researchers, led by the work of the Empirical Studies of Conflict (ESOC) group at Princeton University <ref>{{cite web |url=https://esoc.princeton.edu/|title=Research Highlights &#124; Empirical Studies of Conflict}}</ref>, and the Conflict and Peace, Research and Development (CPRD) group at the University of Michigan.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.isr.umich.edu/cps/events/cprd/|title=Center for Political Studies - Conflict & Peace, Research & Development (CPRD)}}</ref> Berman, Shapiro, and Felter have outlined the modern information-centric model.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Berman |first1=Eli |last2=Shapiro |first2=Jacob |last3=Felter |first3=Joseph |date=2018 |title=Small Wars, Big Data |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400890118}}</ref> In this framework, the critical determinant of counterinsurgent success is information about insurgents provided to counterinsurgents, such as insurgent locations, plans, and targets. Information can be acquired from civilian sources (human intelligence, [[Human_intelligence_(intelligence_gathering)|HUMINT]]), or through signals intelligence ([[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]]). \n\n==Tactics==\n\n===Population control===\n[[File:Gvnhamlet.jpg|thumb|right|267px|A [[strategic hamlet]] in [[South Vietnam]] c.1964]]\n\nWith regard to tactics, the terms \"drain the water\" or \"drain the swamp\" involves the forced [[population transfer|relocation]] of the population (\"water\") to expose the rebels or [[insurgent]]s (\"fish\"). In other words, relocation deprives the aforementioned of the support, cover, and resources of the local population.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of the strategy was applied by the [[British Empire]] during the [[Second Boer War]]; to segregate potential [[Boer]] supporters from [[Boer Commando]]s, [[scorched earth]] tactics were used to destroy Boer farmland while Boers were shipped abroad or confined to [[Second Boer War#Concentration camps (1900\u20131902)|concentration camps]] converted from refugee camps for displaced Boers. The tactic was later refined in the [[Briggs' Plan|Briggs Plan]] during the [[Malayan Emergency]], when predominantly [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] rural population centers with suspected [[Malayan Races Liberation Army]] sympathizers were gutted and their populations transferred to enclosed and guarded \"[[New village|New Villages]]\" to control and monitor population activity; to improve local support for the British, New Villages were equipped with adequate basic amenities, including running water, electricity, and health and education services.\n\nA somewhat similar strategy was used extensively by [[US forces]] in [[South Vietnam]] until 1969, initially by forcing the rural population into fenced, secured villages, referred to as [[Strategic Hamlet]]s, and later by declaring the areas people in the Strategic Hamlets had come from as [[free-fire zone]]s to remove the remainder of the population from their villages and farms. Widespread use was made of [[Agent Orange]] (which was first used on a large scale by the British during the Malayan Emergency), sprayed from airplanes, to destroy crops that might have provided resources for [[Viet Cong]] and [[North Vietnamese troops]] and their human support base. These measures proved ineffective, since [[Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1ea3o]], who oversaw the program, was a communist agent and sabotaged the implementation of the hamlets. This allowed Viet Cong activists and sympathizers to infiltrate the new communities.<ref>Karnow, p. 274</ref> In any event, the [[Vietnam War]] was only partly a counter-insurgency campaign, as it also involved conventional combat between US/[[ARVN]] forces, [[Vietcong]] Main Force Battalions, and the North Vietnamese Army ([[Vietnam People's Army|NVA]]).\n\nAccording to a report of the [[Naval Postgraduate School]]:\n{{Quote|Among the most effective means are such population-control measures as vehicle and personnel checkpoints and national identity cards. In Malaya, the requirement to carry an [[ID card]] with a photo and thumbprint forced the [[communist]]s to abandon their original three-phase political-military strategy and caused divisive infighting among their leaders over how to respond to this effective population-control measure.<ref name=Sepp>{{Cite journal| first = Kalev I. | last = Sepp| title = Best Practices in Counterinsurgency| journal = Military Review| date = May\u2013June 2005| pages = 8\u201312| url = http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/milreview/sepp.pdf}}</ref>}}\n\n===Oil spot===\nThe oil spot approach is the concentration of counter-insurgent forces into an expanding, secured zone.

The goal of COIN operations is to render the insurgents as ineffective and non-influential, by having strong and secure relations with the population of the host nation.\n\nAn understanding of the host nation and the environment that the COIN operations will take place in is essential. Public diplomacy in COIN warfare is only effective when there is a clear understanding of the culture and population at hand. One of the largest factors needed for defeating an insurgency involves understanding the populace, how they interact with the insurgents, how they interact with [[non-government organizations]] in the area, and how they view the counterinsurgency operations themselves.\n\n[[Ethics]] is a common public diplomacy aspect that is emphasized in COIN warfare. Insurgents win their war by attacking internal will and the international opposition. In order to combat these tactics the counterinsurgency operations need to treat their prisoners and detainees humanely and according to American values and principles. By doing this, COIN operations show the host nation's population that they can be trusted and that they are concerned about the well being of the population in order to be successful in warfare.\n\n[[File:U.S. Marine Hearts and Minds.jpg|thumb|left|287px|[[Operation Moshtarak]]; A [[U.S. Marine]] hands out candy to children while conducting counterinsurgency operations in [[Marjah]], [[Afghanistan]] 2010]]\n\n\"Political, social, and economic programs are usually more valuable than conventional military operations in addressing the root causes of the conflict and undermining the insurgency.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Petraeus|first=General David H.|title=Counterinsurgency Field Manual|year=2006|pages=2\u20131|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-24.pdf}}</ref> These programs are essential in order to gain the support of the population. These programs are designed to make the local population feel secure, safe, and more aligned with the counterinsurgency efforts; this enables the citizens of the host nation to trust the goals and purposes of the counterinsurgency efforts, as opposed to the insurgents\u2019. A counterinsurgency is a battle of ideas and the implementation and integration of these programs is important for success. Social, political and economic programs should be coordinated and administered by the host nation's leaders, as well. Successful COIN warfare allows the population to see that the counterinsurgency efforts are including the host nation in their re-building programs. The war is fought among the people and for the people between the insurgents and the counterinsurgents.\n\nA counterinsurgency is won by utilizing strategic communications and [[Information warfare|information operations]] successfully. A counterinsurgency is a competition of ideas, ideologies, and socio-political movements. In order to combat insurgent ideologies one must understand the values and characteristics of the [[ideology]] or religion. Additionally, counterinsurgency efforts need to understand the culture of which the insurgency resides, in order to strategically launch information and communication operations against the insurgent ideology or religion. Counterinsurgency information operatives need to also identify key audiences, communicators, and public leaders to know whom to influence and reach out to with their information.<ref name=\"Krawchuk\">{{cite journal|last=Krawchuk|first=Fred T.|title=Strategic Communication: An Integral Component of Counterinsurgency Operations|journal=The Quarterly Journal|date=Winter 2006|volume=3|series=5|pages=35\u201350|url=http://www.pfpconsortium.org/file/2489/view|accessdate=April 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007000952/http://www.pfpconsortium.org/file/2489/view|archive-date=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n\n=== Information operations ===\nPublic diplomacy in information operations can only be achieved by a complete understanding of the [[culture]] it is operating in.\nCounterinsurgency operations must be able to perceive the world from the locals\u2019 perspective. To develop a comprehensive cultural picture counterinsurgency efforts should invest in employing \"media consultants, finance and business experts, psychologists, organizational network analysts, and scholars from a wide range of disciplines.\"<ref name=\"Krawchuk\"/> Most importantly, counterinsurgency efforts need to be able to understand why the local population is drawn into the insurgent ideology, like what aspects are appealing and how insurgents use information to draw their followers into the ideology. Counterinsurgency communication efforts need a baseline understanding of values, attitudes, and perceptions of the people in the area of operations to conduct successful public diplomacy to defeat the enemy.\n\nDeveloping information and communication strategies involve providing a legitimate alternate ideology, improving security and economic opportunity, and strengthening family ties outside of the [[insurgency]]. In order to conduct public diplomacy through these means, counterinsurgency communication needs to match its deeds with its words. Information provided through public diplomacy during a counterinsurgency cannot lie, the information and communication to the people always has to be truthful and trustworthy in order to be effective at countering the insurgents. Public diplomacy in counterinsurgency to influence the public thoughts and ideas is a long time engagement and should not be done through negative campaigning about the enemy.\n\nConducting public diplomacy through relaying information and communicating with the public in a counterinsurgency is most successful when a conversation can happen between the counterinsurgency team and the local population of the area of operation. Building rapport with the public involves \"listening, paying attention, and being responsive and proactive\" which is sufficient for the local population to understand and trust the counterinsurgency efforts and vice versa.<ref name=\"Krawchuk\"/> This relationship is stringent upon the counterinsurgents keeping their promises, providing security to the locals, and communicating their message directly and quickly in times of need.\n\nUnderstanding and influencing the cognitive dimension of the local population is essential to winning counterinsurgency warfare. The people's perception of legitimacy about the host nation and the foreign country's counterinsurgency efforts is where success is determined. \"The free flow of information present in all theaters via television, telephone, and Internet, can present conflicting messages and quickly defeat the intended effects.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Joint Publication 3-24|title=Counterinsurgency Operations|date=October 2009|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_24.pdf|access-date=2011-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221100351/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_24.pdf|archive-date=2011-02-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> Coordination between the counterinsurgency operations, the host nation, and the local media in information presented to the public is essential to showing and influencing how the local population perceives the counterinsurgency efforts and the host nation.\n\n[[Public opinion]], the media, and rumors influence how the people view counterinsurgency, the government hosting their efforts, and the host nation [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]]. The use of public diplomacy to strategically relay the correct messages and information to the public is essential to success in a counterinsurgency operation. For example, close relationships with media members in the area is essential to ensure that the locals understand the counterinsurgency objectives and feel secure with the host nation government and the counterinsurgency efforts. If the local media is not in sync with the counterinsurgency operatives then they could spread incomplete or false information about the counterinsurgency campaign to the public.\n\n\"Given Al Qaeda\u2019s global reach, the United States must develop a more integrated strategic communication strategy for counter-insurgency with its allies to diminish violent rhetoric, improve its image abroad, and detect, deter, and defeat this social movement at its many levels.\"<ref name=\"Krawchuk\"/> Information operations and communicative abilities are one of the largest and most influence aspects of public diplomacy within a counterinsurgency.\n\nPublic diplomacy is especially important as modern insurgents are more easily able to gain support through a variety of sources, both local and transnational, thanks to advances in increased communication and globalization. Consequently, modern counter-insurgency requires attention to be focused on an insurgency's ecosystem from the national to the local level, in order to deprive the insurgency of support and prevent future insurgent groups from forming.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kilcullen|first1=David|title=Counter-insurgency Redux|journal=Survival: Global Politics and Strategy|date=Nov 30, 2006|volume=48|issue=4|pages=113\u2013130|doi=10.1080/00396330601062790}}</ref>\n\n==Specific doctrines==\n===Vietnam War===\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], counter-insurgency initially formed part of the earlier war as Diem had implemented the poorly conceived [[Strategic Hamlet Program]], a similar model to the Malayan Emergency whom had opposite effects. Similarly economic and rural development formed a key strategy as part of Rural Affairs development<ref name=\":0\"/>.  While the earlier war was marked by considerable emphasis on counter-insurgency programs US forces initially relied on very little if any theoretical doctrine of counter-insurgency during the [[Joint warfare in South Vietnam, 1963\u201369#Military strategy|Ground-Intervention phase]]. Conventional warfare using massive fire-power and failure to implement adequate counter-insurgency had extremely negative effects and was the strategy whom the NVA were adept at countering through the [[Viet Cong and PAVN strategy, organization and structure#The Protracted War conflict model|protracted political and military warfare model]]. These are in part, reasons for the outright failure of U.S strategic policy in the war<ref name=\":0\"/>. Following the replacement of General [[William Westmoreland]], newer concepts were tried including a revival of earlier COIN strategies including [[Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support]]. This was alongside the brutal and oftentimes badly implemented civilian-assassination program [[Phoenix Program]] targeting Viet Cong civilian personnel. These reasons were contributing factors to the U.S failure as it had become too late by then.\n\n===British Empire===\n\n====Malaya====\nBritish forces were able to employ the relocation method with considerable success during the \"[[Malayan Emergency]]\". The [[Briggs' Plan|Briggs Plan]], implemented fully in 1950, relocated [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] [[Federation of Malaya|Malayans]] into protected \"[[New village|New Villages]]\", designated by British forces. By the end of 1951, some 400,000 ethnic Chinese had moved into the fortifications. Of this population, the British forces were able to form a \"Home Guard\", armed for resistance against the [[Malayan Communist Party]], an implementation mirrored by the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] later used by US forces in South Vietnam.<ref name=Nagl>{{Cite book\n |first = John | last = Nagl\n | title = Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife: Counterinsurgency Lessons from Malaya and Vietnam\n| publisher = Praeger Publishers\n| year = 2002\n|isbn=978-0-275-97695-8\n }}</ref><ref name=Thompson>{{Cite book\n | authorlink = Robert Grainger Ker Thompson | first = Robert | last = Thompson\n | title = Defeating Communist Insurgency: Lessons from Malaya and Vietnam\n | publisher =Chatto & Windus\n | year =1966\n | isbn=978-0-7011-1133-5\n }}</ref> Despite British claims of a victory in the Malayan Emergency, military historian [[Martin van Creveld]] noted that the end result of the counterinsurgency, namely the withdrawal of British forces and establishment of an independent state, are identical to that of [[Aden]], [[Kenya]] and [[Cyprus]], which are not considered victories.<ref>van Creveld, p. 221</ref>\n\n===Dutch Empire===\nThe Dutch formulated a new strategy of counter-insurgency warfare, during the [[Aceh War]] by deploying light-armed [[Korps Marechaussee te voet|Marechaussee]] units and using scorched earth tactics.\n\nIn 1898 [[Van Heutsz]] was proclaimed governor of Aceh, and with his lieutenant, later Dutch Prime Minister [[Hendrikus Colijn]], would finally conquer most of Aceh. They followed [[Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje|Hurgronje]]'s suggestions, finding cooperative ''uleebelang'' or secular chiefs that would support them in the countryside and isolating the resistance from their rural support base.\n\nDuring the [[South Sulawesi campaign of 1946\u20131947|South Sulawesi Campaign]] Captain [[Raymond Westerling]] of the [[Korps Speciale Troepen|KST]], Special Forces of the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] used the '''Westerling Method'''. Westerling ordered the registration of all Javanese arriving in Makassar due to the large numbers of Javanese participating in the Sulawesi resistance. He also used scouts to infiltrate local villages and to identify members of the resistance.<ref>http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/19/westerling039s-war.html</ref>\n\nBased on their information and that of the Dutch military intelligence service, the DST surrounded one of more suspected villages during night, after which they drove the population to a central location. At daybreak, the operation began, often led by Westerling. Men would be separated from women and children. From the gathered information Westerling exposed certain people as terrorists and murderers. They were shot without any further investigation. Afterwards Westerling forced local communities to refrain from supporting guerillas by swearing on the Quran and established local self-defence units with some members recruited from former guerrillas deemed as \"redeemable\".\n\nWesterling directed eleven operations throughout the campaign. He succeeded in eliminating the insurgency and undermining local support for the Republicans. His actions restored Dutch rule in southern Sulawesi. However, the Netherlands East Indies government and the Dutch army command soon realised that Westerling's notoriety led to growing public criticism. In April 1947 the Dutch government instituted an official inquiry of his controversial methods. Raymond Westerling was put on the sidelines. He was relieved of his duties in November 1948.\n\n===France===\n{{Tone|date=February 2020}}\nFrance had major counterinsurgency wars in its [[colonies]] in [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]].

The 1957 [[Battle of Algiers (1957)|Battle of Algiers]] resulted in 24,000 detentions, with most [[torture]]d and an estimated 3,000 killed.

This contributes to the difficulty that foreign, as opposed to indigenous, powers have in counter-insurgent operations.\nOne of France's most influential theorists was [[Roger Trinquier]]. The ''Modern Warfare'' counterinsurgency strategy described by Trinquier, who had led [[anti-communist]] guerrillas in [[Indochina]], was a strong influence on French efforts in Algeria.\n\nTrinquier suggested three principles:\n# separate the guerrilla from the population that supports him;\n# occupy the zones that the guerrillas previously operated from, making the area dangerous for the insurgents and turning the people against the guerrilla movement; and\n# coordinate actions over a wide area and for a long enough time that the guerrilla is denied access to the population centres that could support him.\n\nTrinquier's view was that [[torture]] had to be extremely focused and limited, but many French officers considered its use corrosive to its own side. There were strong protests among French leaders: the Army's most decorated officer, General [[Jacques P\u00e2ris de Bollardi\u00e8re]], confronted General [[Jacques Massu]], the commander of French forces in the Battle of Algiers, over orders institutionalizing torture, as \"an unleashing of deplorable instincts which no longer knew any limits.\" He issued an open letter condemning the danger to the army of the loss of its moral values \"under the fallacious pretext of immediate expediency\", and was imprisoned for sixty days.<ref name=McClintock-2005 />\n\nAs some of the French Army protested, other parts increased the intensity of their approach, which led to an attempted [[military coup]] against the [[French Fourth Republic]] itself. Massu and General [[Raoul Salan]] led a 1958 coup in [[Algiers]], demanding a new Republic under [[Charles de Gaulle]]. When de Gaulle's policies toward Algeria, such as a 1961 referendum on Algerian self-determination, did not meet the expectations of the colonial officers, Salan formed the underground [[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] (OAS), a [[right-wing]] terrorist group, whose actions included a 1962 assassination attempt against de Gaulle himself.\n\n====West Africa====\nFrance has had taken [[Insurgency#Barnett and connecting to the core|Barnett's Leviathan role]]<ref name=Barnett>{{cite book\n | author = Barnett, Thomas P.M.\n | authorlink = Thomas P.M.

In his ''Reflexiones Militares'', published between 1726 and 1730, he discussed how to spot early signs of an incipient insurgency, prevent insurgencies, and counter them, if they could not be warded off. Strikingly, Santa Cruz recognized that insurgencies are usually due to real grievances: \"A state rarely rises up without the fault of its governors.\" Consequently, he advocated clemency towards the population and good governance, to seek the people's \"heart and love\".<ref name=\"test\">Excerpts from Santa Cruz's writings, translated into English, in Beatrice Heuser: ''The Strategy Makers: Thoughts on War and Society from Machiavelli to Clausewitz'' (Santa Monica, CA: Greenwood/Praeger, 2010), {{ISBN|978-0-275-99826-4}}, pp. 124-146.</ref>\n\n===B. H. Liddell Hart===\nThe majority of counter-insurgency efforts by major powers in the last century have been spectacularly unsuccessful. This may be attributed to a number of causes. First, as [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] pointed out in the Insurgency addendum to the second version of his book ''[[Strategy: The Indirect Approach]]'', a popular insurgency has an inherent advantage over any occupying force. He showed as a prime example the [[Peninsular War|French occupation of Spain]] during the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Whenever Spanish forces managed to constitute themselves into a regular fighting force, the superior French forces beat them every time.\n\nHowever, once dispersed and decentralized, the [[irregular warfare|irregular nature]] of the rebel campaigns proved a decisive counter to French superiority on the battlefield. [[Napoleon]]'s army had no means of effectively combatting the rebels, and in the end their strength and morale were so sapped that when [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] was finally able to challenge French forces in the field, the French had almost no choice but to abandon the situation.\n\nCounter-insurgency efforts may be successful, especially when the insurgents are unpopular. The [[Philippine\u2013American War]], the [[Shining Path]] in Peru, and the [[Malayan Emergency]] in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] have been the sites of failed insurgencies.\n\nHart also points to the experiences of [[T. E. Lawrence]] and the [[Arab Revolt]] during [[World War I]] as another example of the power of the rebel/insurgent. Though the [[Ottomans]] often had advantages in manpower of more than 100 to 1, the [[Arab]]s' ability to materialize out of the desert, strike, and disappear again often left the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] reeling and paralyzed, creating an opportunity for regular [[British forces]] to sweep in and finish the Turkish forces off.\n\nIn both the preceding cases, the insurgents and rebel fighters were working in conjunction with or in a manner complementary to regular forces. Such was also the case with the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]] and the [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front]] during the Vietnam War. The strategy in these cases is for the irregular combatant to weaken and destabilize the enemy to such a degree that victory is easy or assured for the regular forces. However, in many modern rebellions, one does not see rebel fighters working in conjunction with regular forces. Rather, they are home-grown [[militia]]s or imported fighters who have no unified goals or objectives save to expel the occupier.\n\nAccording to Liddell Hart, there are few effective counter-measures to this strategy. So long as the insurgency maintains popular support, it will retain all of its strategic advantages of mobility, invisibility, and legitimacy in its own eyes and the eyes of the people. So long as this is the situation, an insurgency essentially cannot be defeated by regular forces.\n\nAnother option in combating an insurgency would be to make the presence of troops so pervasive that there is simply no place left for insurgents to hide, as demonstrated in [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s conquest of [[Republican Spain]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] or the Union occupation of [[Confederate States]] with Federal troops following the [[American Civil War]]. In each of these cases, enormous amounts of manpower were needed for an extended period to quell resistance over almost every square kilometre of territory. In an age of ever shrinking and increasingly computerized armed forces, this option too is precluded from a modern commander's options.\n\nEssentially, then, only one viable option remains. The key to a successful counter-insurgency is the winning-over of the occupied territory's population. If that can be achieved, then the rebellion will be deprived of its supplies, shelter, and, more importantly, its moral legitimacy. Unless the [[Hearts and minds (concept)|hearts and minds]] of the public can be separated from the insurgency, the occupation is doomed to fail. In a modern [[representative democracy]], in the face of perceived incessant losses, no conflict will be tolerated by an electorate without significant show of tangible gains.\n\n* '''Vietnam War'''\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], counter-insurgency initially formed part of the earlier war as Diem had implemented the poorly conceived [[strategic Hamlet Program]], a similar model to the Malayan Emergency whom had opposite effects. Similarly economic and rural development formed a key strategy as part of Rural Affairs development.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.afsa.org/counterinsurgency-vietnam-lessons-today|title=Counterinsurgency in Vietnam: Lessons for Today - The Foreign Service Journal - April 2015|author=|date=|website=www.afsa.org}}</ref> While the earlier war was marked by considerable emphasis on counter-insurgency programs US forces initially relied on very little if any theoretical doctrine of counter-insurgency during the [[Joint warfare in South Vietnam, 1963\u201369]] phase. This was more or less a failing strategy on the part of the United States, as conventional means were applied in direct contradiction to the wisdom of counter-insurgency. \n\n* '''Current situations'''\nIn these cases, such as the [[Israeli occupation of Lebanon]], which ended in 2000, and the recent [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]], the goal of the insurgent is not to defeat the occupying military force; that is almost always an impossible task given the disparity in resources. Rather, they seek through a constant campaign of sneak attacks to inflict continuous casualties upon their superior enemy forces and thereby over time demoralize the occupying forces and erode political support for the occupation in the homeland of the occupying forces. It is a simple strategy of repeated pin-pricks and bleeding that, though small in proportion to the total force strength, sap the will of the occupier to continue the fight.\n\n===David Galula===\n[[David Galula]] gained his practical experience in counter-insurgency as a French officer in the [[Algerian War]]. His theory of counterinsurgency is not primarily military, but a combination of military, political and social actions under the strong control of a single authority.\n\nGalula proposes four \"laws\" for counterinsurgency:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crinfo.org/booksummary/10672/ |author=Reeder, Brett |title=Book Summary of Counterinsurgency Warfare: Theory and Practice by David Galula |publisher=Crinfo.org (The Conflict Resolution Information Source) |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref>\n\n# The aim of the war is to gain the support of the population rather than control of territory.\n# Most of the population will be neutral in the conflict; support of the masses can be obtained with the help of an active friendly minority.\n# Support of the population may be lost. The population must be efficiently protected to allow it to cooperate without fear of retribution by the opposite party.\n# Order enforcement should be done progressively by removing or driving away armed opponents, then gaining support of the population, and eventually strengthening positions by building infrastructure and setting long-term relationships with the population. This must be done area by area, using a pacified territory as a basis of operation to conquer a neighboring area.\n\nGalula contends that:\n{{quote|A victory [in a counterinsurgency] is not the destruction in a given area of the insurgent's forces and his political organization. ... A victory is that plus the permanent isolation of the insurgent from the population, isolation not enforced upon the population, but maintained by and with the population. ... In conventional warfare, strength is assessed according to military or other tangible criteria, such as the number of divisions, the position they hold, the industrial resources, etc. In revolutionary warfare, strength must be assessed by the extent of support from the population as measured in terms of political organization at the grass roots. The counterinsurgent reaches a position of strength when his power is embedded in a political organization issuing from, and firmly supported by, the population.<ref name=galula />}}\n\nWith his four principles in mind, Galula goes on to describe a general military and political strategy to put them into operation in an area that is under full insurgent control:\n\n{{Quote|In a Selected Area<br>\n1. Concentrate enough armed forces to destroy or to expel the main body of armed insurgents.<br>\n2. Detach for the area sufficient troops to oppose an insurgent's comeback in strength, install these troops in the hamlets, villages, and towns where the population lives.<br>\n3. Establish contact with the population, control its movements in order to cut off its links with the guerrillas.<br>\n4. Destroy the local insurgent political organization.<br>\n5. Set up, by means of elections, new provisional local authorities.<br>\n6. Test those authorities by assigning them various concrete tasks. Replace the softs and the incompetents, give full support to the active leaders. Organize self-defense units.<br>\n7. Group and educate the leaders in a national political movement.<br>\n8.

Thompson outlines five basic principles for a successful counter-insurgency:\n\n# The government must have a clear political aim: to establish and maintain a free, independent and united country which is politically and economically stable and viable;\n# The government must function in accordance with the law;\n# The government must have an overall plan;\n# The government must give priority to defeating political subversion, not the guerrillas;\n# In the guerrilla phase of an insurgency, a government must secure its base areas first.<ref name=\"Hamilton1998\">{{cite book | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = Donald W. | title = The art of insurgency: American military policy and the failure of strategy in Southeast Asia | publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group]] | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-275-95734-6}}</ref>\n\n===David Kilcullen===\n[[File:Kilcullen3Pillars.svg|thumb|right|350px|Three Pillars of Counterinsurgency]]\n\nIn \"The Three Pillars of Counterinsurgency\", Dr. [[David Kilcullen]], the Chief Strategist of the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism of the [[U.S. State Department]] in 2006, described a framework for interagency cooperation in counterinsurgency operations. His pillars \u2013 Security, Political and Economic \u2013 support the overarching goal of Control, but are based on Information:\n\n{{quote|This is because perception is crucial in developing control and influence over population groups. Substantive security, political and economic measures are critical but to be effective they must rest upon, and integrate with a broader information strategy. Every action in counterinsurgency sends a message; the purpose of the information campaign is to consolidate and unify this message. ... Importantly, the information campaign has to be conducted at a global, regional and local level \u2014 because modern insurgents draw upon global networks of sympathy, support, funding and recruitment.<ref name=kilcullen>{{cite web| url = http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/uscoin/3pillars_of_counterinsurgency.pdf | title = Three Pillars of Counterinsurgency| first = David | last = Kilcullen | authorlink = David Kilcullen | conference = U.S. Government Counterinsurgency Conference, Washington D.C. | date =28 September 2006}}</ref>}}\n\nKilcullen considers the three pillars to be of equal importance, because\n{{quote|unless they are developed in parallel, the campaign becomes unbalanced: too much economic assistance with inadequate security, for example, simply creates an array of soft targets for the insurgents.

In each case, we seek not only to establish control, but also to consolidate that control and then transfer it to permanent, effective and legitimate institutions.\"<ref name=kilcullen />\n\n===Martin van Creveld===\nMilitary historian [[Martin van Creveld]], noting that almost all attempts to deal with insurgency have ended in failure, advises:\n{{quote|The first, and absolutely indispensable, thing to do is throw overboard 99 percent of the literature on counterinsurgency, counterguerrilla, counterterrorism, and the like. Since most of it was written by the losing side, it is of little value.<ref>van Creveld, p. 268</ref>}}\n\nIn examining why so many counterinsurgencies by powerful militaries fail against weaker enemies, Van Creveld identifies a key dynamic that he illustrates by the metaphor of killing a child. Regardless of whether the child started the fight or how well armed the child is, an adult in a fight with a child will feel that he is acting unjustly if he harms the child and foolish if the child harms him; he will therefore wonder if the fight is necessary.\n\nVan Creveld argues that \"by definition, a strong counterinsurgent who uses his strength to kill the members of a small, weak organization of insurgents \u2013 let alone the civilian population by which it is surrounded, and which may lend it support \u2013 will commit crimes in an unjust cause,\" while \"a child who is in a serious fight with an adult is justified in using every and any means available \u2013 not because he or she is right, but because he or she has no choice.\"<ref>van Creveld, p. 226</ref> Every act of insurgency becomes, from the perspective of the counterinsurgent, a reason to end the conflict, while also being a reason for the insurgents to continue until victory. [[Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh]], second in command to [[Ho Chi Minh]] of [[Vietnam]], wrote in his ''Primer for Revolt'':\n{{Quote|The guiding principle of the strategy for our whole resistance must be to prolong the war. To protract the war is the key to victory. Why must the war be protracted? ... If we throw the whole of our forces into a few battles to try to decide the outcome, we shall certainly be defeated and the enemy will win. On the other hand, if while fighting we maintain our forces, expand them, train our army and people, learn military tactics ... and at the same time wear down the enemy forces, we shall weary and discourage them in such a way that, strong as they are, they will become weak and will meet defeat instead of victory.<ref>van Creveld, pp. 229-230</ref>}}\n\nVan Creveld thus identifies \"time\" as the key factor in counterinsurgency. In an attempt to find lessons from the few cases of successful counterinsurgency, of which he lists two clear cases: the British efforts during [[The Troubles]] of [[Northern Ireland]] and the 1982 [[Hama massacre]] carried out by the [[Syria]]n government to suppress the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], he asserts that the \"core of the difficulty is neither military nor political, but moral\" and outlines two distinct methods.<ref>van Creveld, p. 269</ref>\n\nThe first method relies on superb intelligence, provided by those who know the natural and artificial environment of the conflict as well as the insurgents. Once such superior intelligence is gained, the counterinsurgents must be trained to a point of high professionalism and discipline such that they will exercise discrimination and restraint. Through such discrimination and restraint, the counterinsurgents do not alienate members of the populace besides those already fighting them, while delaying the time when the counterinsurgents become disgusted by their own actions and demoralized.\n\nGeneral Patrick Walters, British commander of troops in northern Ireland, explicitly stated that his objective was not to kill as many terrorists as possible, but to ensure that as few people on both sides were killed. In the vast majority of counterinsurgencies, the \"forces of order\" kill far more people than they lose. In contrast and using very rough figures, the struggle in Northern Ireland had cost the United Kingdom three thousand casualties in dead alone. Of the three thousand, about seventeen hundred were civilians...of the remaining, a thousand were British soldiers. No more than three hundred were terrorists, a ratio of three to one.<ref name=\"van Creveld, 235\">van Creveld, p. 235</ref>\n\nIf the prerequisites for the first method \u2013 excellent intelligence, superbly trained and disciplined soldiers and police, and an iron will to avoid being provoked into lashing out \u2013 are lacking, van Creveld posits that counterinsurgents who still want to win must use the second method exemplified by the [[Hama massacre]]. In 1982 the regime of Syrian president [[Hafez al-Assad]] was on the point of being overwhelmed by the countrywide insurgency of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. al-Assad sent a division under his brother [[Rifaat al-Assad|Rifaat]] to the city of [[Hama]], known to be the center of the resistance.\n\nFollowing a counterattack by the Brotherhood, Rifaat used his heavy artillery to demolish the city, killing between ten and 25 thousand people, including many women and children. Asked by reporters what had happened, Hafez al-Assad exaggerated the damage and deaths, promoted the commanders who carried out the attacks, and razed Hama's well-known great mosque, replacing it with a parking lot. With the Muslim Brotherhood scattered, the population was so cowed that it would be years before opposition groups dared to disobey the regime again and, van Creveld argues, the massacre most likely saved the regime and prevented a bloody [[civil war]].\n\nVan Creveld condenses al-Assad's strategy into five rules, while noting that they could easily have been written by [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]:<ref name=\"van Creveld, 235\"/>\n# There are situations in which cruelty is necessary, and refusing to apply necessary cruelty is a betrayal of the people who put you into power. When pressed to cruelty, never threaten your opponent but disguise your intention and feign weakness until you strike.\n# Once you decide to strike, it is better to kill too many than not enough. If another strike is needed, it reduces the impact of the first strike. Repeated strikes will also endanger the morale of the counterinsurgent troops; soldiers forced to commit repeated atrocities will likely begin to resort to alcohol or drugs to force themselves to carry out orders and will inevitably lose their military edge, eventually turning into a danger to their commanders.\n# Act as soon as possible. More lives will be saved by decisive action early, than by prolonging the insurgency. The longer you wait, the more inured the population will be to bloodshed, and the more barbaric your action will have to be to make an impression.\n# Strike openly. Do not apologize, make excuses about \"[[collateral damage]]\", express regret, or promise investigations. Afterwards, make sure that as many people as possible know of your strike; media is useful for this purpose, but be careful not to let them interview survivors and arouse sympathy.\n# Do not command the strike yourself, in case it doesn't work for some reason and you need to disown your commander and try another strategy. If it does work, present your commander to the world, explain what you have done and make certain that everyone understands that you are ready to strike again.<ref>van Creveld, pp. 241\u2013245</ref>\n\n===Lorenzo Zambernardi===\nIn \"Counterinsurgency\u2019s Impossible Trilemma\", Dr. Lorenzo Zambernardi, an Italian academic now working in the United States, clarifies the tradeoffs involved in counterinsurgency operations.<ref>Zambernardi, Lorenzo, \"Counterinsurgency's Impossible Trilemma\", ''The Washington Quarterly'', 33:3, July 2010, pp. 21-34</ref> He argues that counterinsurgency involves three main goals, but in real practice a counterinsurgent needs to choose two goals out of three. Relying on economic theory, this is what Zambernardi labels the \"impossible trilemma\" of counterinsurgency. Specifically, the impossible trilemma suggests that it is impossible to simultaneously achieve: 1) force protection, 2) distinction between enemy combatants and noncombatants, and 3) the physical elimination of insurgents.\n\nAccording to Zambernardi, in pursuing any two of these three goals, a state must forgo some portion of the third objective. In particular, a state can protect its armed forces while destroying insurgents, but only by indiscriminately killing civilians as the Ottomans, Italians, and Nazis did in the Balkans, Libya, and Eastern Europe. It can choose to protect civilians along with its own armed forces instead, avoiding so-called collateral damage, but only by abandoning the objective of destroying the insurgents. Finally, a state can discriminate between combatants and noncombatants while killing insurgents, but only by increasing the risks for its own troops, because often insurgents will hide behind civilians, or appear to be civilians. So a country must choose two out of three goals and develop a strategy that can successfully accomplish them, while sacrificing the third objective.\n\nZambernardi's theory posits that to protect populations, which is necessary to defeat insurgencies, and to physically destroy an insurgency, the counterinsurgent's military forces must be sacrificed, risking the loss of domestic political support.\n\n===Akali Omeni===\nAnother writer who explores a trio of features relevant to understanding counter-insurgency is Akali Omeni. Within the contemporary context, COIN warfare by African militaries tends to be at the margins of the theoretical debate - even though Africa today is faced with a number of deadly insurgencies. In ''Counter-insurgency in Nigeria'', Omeni, a Nigerian academic, discusses the interactions between certain features away from the battlefield, which account for battlefield performance against insurgent warfare. Specifically, Omeni argues that the trio of historical experience, organisational culture (OC) and doctrine, help explain the institution of COIN within militaries and their tendency to reject the innovation and adaptation often necessary to defeat insurgency. These three features, furthermore, influence and can undermine the operational tactics and concepts adopted against insurgents. The COIN challenge, therefore, is not just operational; it also is cultural and institutional before ever it reflects on the battlefield.\n\nAccording to Omeni, institutional isomorphism is a sociological phenomenon that constrains the habits of a military (in this case, the Nigerian military) to the long-established, yet increasingly ineffective, ideology of the offensive in irregular warfare. As Omeni writes,\n\n<blockquote>Whereas the Nigerian military\u2019s performance against militias in the Niger Delta already suggested the military had a poor grasp of the threat of insurgent warfare; it was further along the line, as the military struggled against Boko Haram\u2019s threat, that the extent of this weakness was exposed. At best, the utility of force, for the Nigerian military, had become but a temporary solution against the threat of insurgent warfare. At worst, the existing model has been perpetuated at such high cost, that urgent revisionist thinking around the idea of counter-insurgency within the military institution may now be required. Additionally, the military\u2019s decisive civil war victory, the pivot in Nigeria\u2019s strategic culture towards a regional role, and the institutional delegitimization brought about by decades of coups and political meddling, meant that much time went by without substantive revisionism to military\u2019s thinking around its internal function. Change moreover, where it occurred, was institutionally isomorphic and not as far removed from the military\u2019s own origins as the intervening decades may have suggested.<ref>Omeni, Akali (2017) ''Counter-insurgency in Nigeria: The Military and Operations Against Boko Haram, 2011-17''. Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge.  pp. 52-53.</ref></blockquote> \n\nFurther, the infantry-centric nature of the Nigerian Army's battalions, traceable all the way back to the Civil War in [[Nigeria]] back in the 1960s, is reflected in the kinetic nature of the Army's contemporary COIN approach.<ref>Omeni, Akali (2018) ''Insurgency and War in Nigeria: Regional Fracture and the Fight Against Boko Haram'' (forthcoming) I.B. Tauris.</ref> This approach has failed to defeat Boko Haram in the way many expected. Certainly, therefore, the popular argument today, which holds that the Nigerian Army has struggled in COIN due to capabilities shortcomings, holds some merit. However, a full-spectrum analysis of the Nigeria case suggests that this popular dominant narrative scarcely scratches the surface of the true COIN challenge. This population-centered challenge, moreover, is one that militaries across the world continue to contend with. And in attempting to solve the COIN puzzle, state forces over the decades have tried a range of tactics.<ref>Omeni, Akali (2017) ''Counter-insurgency in Nigeria: The Military and Operations against Boko Haram, 2011-17''. Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge</ref>\n\n===Information-Centric Theory===\n\nStarting in the early 2000s, micro-level data has transformed analysis of effective counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. Leading this work is the \"information-centric\" group of theorists and researchers, led by the work of the Empirical Studies of Conflict (ESOC) group at Princeton University <ref>{{cite web |url=https://esoc.princeton.edu/|title=Research Highlights &#124; Empirical Studies of Conflict}}</ref>, and the Conflict and Peace, Research and Development (CPRD) group at the University of Michigan.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.isr.umich.edu/cps/events/cprd/|title=Center for Political Studies - Conflict & Peace, Research & Development (CPRD)}}</ref> Berman, Shapiro, and Felter have outlined the modern information-centric model.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Berman |first1=Eli |last2=Shapiro |first2=Jacob |last3=Felter |first3=Joseph |date=2018 |title=Small Wars, Big Data |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400890118}}</ref> In this framework, the critical determinant of counterinsurgent success is information about insurgents provided to counterinsurgents, such as insurgent locations, plans, and targets. Information can be acquired from civilian sources (human intelligence, [[Human_intelligence_(intelligence_gathering)|HUMINT]]), or through signals intelligence ([[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]]). \n\n==Tactics==\n\n===Population control===\n[[File:Gvnhamlet.jpg|thumb|right|267px|A [[strategic hamlet]] in [[South Vietnam]] c.1964]]\n\nWith regard to tactics, the terms \"drain the water\" or \"drain the swamp\" involves the forced [[population transfer|relocation]] of the population (\"water\") to expose the rebels or [[insurgent]]s (\"fish\"). In other words, relocation deprives the aforementioned of the support, cover, and resources of the local population.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of the strategy was applied by the [[British Empire]] during the [[Second Boer War]]; to segregate potential [[Boer]] supporters from [[Boer Commando]]s, [[scorched earth]] tactics were used to destroy Boer farmland while Boers were shipped abroad or confined to [[Second Boer War#Concentration camps (1900\u20131902)|concentration camps]] converted from refugee camps for displaced Boers. The tactic was later refined in the [[Briggs' Plan|Briggs Plan]] during the [[Malayan Emergency]], when predominantly [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] rural population centers with suspected [[Malayan Races Liberation Army]] sympathizers were gutted and their populations transferred to enclosed and guarded \"[[New village|New Villages]]\" to control and monitor population activity; to improve local support for the British, New Villages were equipped with adequate basic amenities, including running water, electricity, and health and education services.\n\nA somewhat similar strategy was used extensively by [[US forces]] in [[South Vietnam]] until 1969, initially by forcing the rural population into fenced, secured villages, referred to as [[Strategic Hamlet]]s, and later by declaring the areas people in the Strategic Hamlets had come from as [[free-fire zone]]s to remove the remainder of the population from their villages and farms. Widespread use was made of [[Agent Orange]] (which was first used on a large scale by the British during the Malayan Emergency), sprayed from airplanes, to destroy crops that might have provided resources for [[Viet Cong]] and [[North Vietnamese troops]] and their human support base. These measures proved ineffective, since [[Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1ea3o]], who oversaw the program, was a communist agent and sabotaged the implementation of the hamlets. This allowed Viet Cong activists and sympathizers to infiltrate the new communities.<ref>Karnow, p. 274</ref> In any event, the [[Vietnam War]] was only partly a counter-insurgency campaign, as it also involved conventional combat between US/[[ARVN]] forces, [[Vietcong]] Main Force Battalions, and the North Vietnamese Army ([[Vietnam People's Army|NVA]]).\n\nAccording to a report of the [[Naval Postgraduate School]]:\n{{Quote|Among the most effective means are such population-control measures as vehicle and personnel checkpoints and national identity cards. In Malaya, the requirement to carry an [[ID card]] with a photo and thumbprint forced the [[communist]]s to abandon their original three-phase political-military strategy and caused divisive infighting among their leaders over how to respond to this effective population-control measure.<ref name=Sepp>{{Cite journal| first = Kalev I. | last = Sepp| title = Best Practices in Counterinsurgency| journal = Military Review| date = May\u2013June 2005| pages = 8\u201312| url = http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/milreview/sepp.pdf}}</ref>}}\n\n===Oil spot===\nThe oil spot approach is the concentration of counter-insurgent forces into an expanding, secured zone.

The goal of COIN operations is to render the insurgents as ineffective and non-influential, by having strong and secure relations with the population of the host nation.\n\nAn understanding of the host nation and the environment that the COIN operations will take place in is essential. Public diplomacy in COIN warfare is only effective when there is a clear understanding of the culture and population at hand. One of the largest factors needed for defeating an insurgency involves understanding the populace, how they interact with the insurgents, how they interact with [[non-government organizations]] in the area, and how they view the counterinsurgency operations themselves.\n\n[[Ethics]] is a common public diplomacy aspect that is emphasized in COIN warfare. Insurgents win their war by attacking internal will and the international opposition. In order to combat these tactics the counterinsurgency operations need to treat their prisoners and detainees humanely and according to American values and principles. By doing this, COIN operations show the host nation's population that they can be trusted and that they are concerned about the well being of the population in order to be successful in warfare.\n\n[[File:U.S. Marine Hearts and Minds.jpg|thumb|left|287px|[[Operation Moshtarak]]; A [[U.S. Marine]] hands out candy to children while conducting counterinsurgency operations in [[Marjah]], [[Afghanistan]] 2010]]\n\n\"Political, social, and economic programs are usually more valuable than conventional military operations in addressing the root causes of the conflict and undermining the insurgency.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Petraeus|first=General David H.|title=Counterinsurgency Field Manual|year=2006|pages=2\u20131|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-24.pdf}}</ref> These programs are essential in order to gain the support of the population. These programs are designed to make the local population feel secure, safe, and more aligned with the counterinsurgency efforts; this enables the citizens of the host nation to trust the goals and purposes of the counterinsurgency efforts, as opposed to the insurgents\u2019. A counterinsurgency is a battle of ideas and the implementation and integration of these programs is important for success. Social, political and economic programs should be coordinated and administered by the host nation's leaders, as well. Successful COIN warfare allows the population to see that the counterinsurgency efforts are including the host nation in their re-building programs. The war is fought among the people and for the people between the insurgents and the counterinsurgents.\n\nA counterinsurgency is won by utilizing strategic communications and [[Information warfare|information operations]] successfully. A counterinsurgency is a competition of ideas, ideologies, and socio-political movements. In order to combat insurgent ideologies one must understand the values and characteristics of the [[ideology]] or religion. Additionally, counterinsurgency efforts need to understand the culture of which the insurgency resides, in order to strategically launch information and communication operations against the insurgent ideology or religion. Counterinsurgency information operatives need to also identify key audiences, communicators, and public leaders to know whom to influence and reach out to with their information.<ref name=\"Krawchuk\">{{cite journal|last=Krawchuk|first=Fred T.|title=Strategic Communication: An Integral Component of Counterinsurgency Operations|journal=The Quarterly Journal|date=Winter 2006|volume=3|series=5|pages=35\u201350|url=http://www.pfpconsortium.org/file/2489/view|accessdate=April 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007000952/http://www.pfpconsortium.org/file/2489/view|archive-date=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n\n=== Information operations ===\nPublic diplomacy in information operations can only be achieved by a complete understanding of the [[culture]] it is operating in.\nCounterinsurgency operations must be able to perceive the world from the locals\u2019 perspective. To develop a comprehensive cultural picture counterinsurgency efforts should invest in employing \"media consultants, finance and business experts, psychologists, organizational network analysts, and scholars from a wide range of disciplines.\"<ref name=\"Krawchuk\"/> Most importantly, counterinsurgency efforts need to be able to understand why the local population is drawn into the insurgent ideology, like what aspects are appealing and how insurgents use information to draw their followers into the ideology. Counterinsurgency communication efforts need a baseline understanding of values, attitudes, and perceptions of the people in the area of operations to conduct successful public diplomacy to defeat the enemy.\n\nDeveloping information and communication strategies involve providing a legitimate alternate ideology, improving security and economic opportunity, and strengthening family ties outside of the [[insurgency]]. In order to conduct public diplomacy through these means, counterinsurgency communication needs to match its deeds with its words. Information provided through public diplomacy during a counterinsurgency cannot lie, the information and communication to the people always has to be truthful and trustworthy in order to be effective at countering the insurgents. Public diplomacy in counterinsurgency to influence the public thoughts and ideas is a long time engagement and should not be done through negative campaigning about the enemy.\n\nConducting public diplomacy through relaying information and communicating with the public in a counterinsurgency is most successful when a conversation can happen between the counterinsurgency team and the local population of the area of operation. Building rapport with the public involves \"listening, paying attention, and being responsive and proactive\" which is sufficient for the local population to understand and trust the counterinsurgency efforts and vice versa.<ref name=\"Krawchuk\"/> This relationship is stringent upon the counterinsurgents keeping their promises, providing security to the locals, and communicating their message directly and quickly in times of need.\n\nUnderstanding and influencing the cognitive dimension of the local population is essential to winning counterinsurgency warfare. The people's perception of legitimacy about the host nation and the foreign country's counterinsurgency efforts is where success is determined. \"The free flow of information present in all theaters via television, telephone, and Internet, can present conflicting messages and quickly defeat the intended effects.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Joint Publication 3-24|title=Counterinsurgency Operations|date=October 2009|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_24.pdf|access-date=2011-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221100351/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_24.pdf|archive-date=2011-02-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> Coordination between the counterinsurgency operations, the host nation, and the local media in information presented to the public is essential to showing and influencing how the local population perceives the counterinsurgency efforts and the host nation.\n\n[[Public opinion]], the media, and rumors influence how the people view counterinsurgency, the government hosting their efforts, and the host nation [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]]. The use of public diplomacy to strategically relay the correct messages and information to the public is essential to success in a counterinsurgency operation. For example, close relationships with media members in the area is essential to ensure that the locals understand the counterinsurgency objectives and feel secure with the host nation government and the counterinsurgency efforts. If the local media is not in sync with the counterinsurgency operatives then they could spread incomplete or false information about the counterinsurgency campaign to the public.\n\n\"Given Al Qaeda\u2019s global reach, the United States must develop a more integrated strategic communication strategy for counter-insurgency with its allies to diminish violent rhetoric, improve its image abroad, and detect, deter, and defeat this social movement at its many levels.\"<ref name=\"Krawchuk\"/> Information operations and communicative abilities are one of the largest and most influence aspects of public diplomacy within a counterinsurgency.\n\nPublic diplomacy is especially important as modern insurgents are more easily able to gain support through a variety of sources, both local and transnational, thanks to advances in increased communication and globalization. Consequently, modern counter-insurgency requires attention to be focused on an insurgency's ecosystem from the national to the local level, in order to deprive the insurgency of support and prevent future insurgent groups from forming.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kilcullen|first1=David|title=Counter-insurgency Redux|journal=Survival: Global Politics and Strategy|date=Nov 30, 2006|volume=48|issue=4|pages=113\u2013130|doi=10.1080/00396330601062790}}</ref>\n\n==Specific doctrines==\n===Vietnam War===\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], counter-insurgency initially formed part of the earlier war as Diem had implemented the poorly conceived [[Strategic Hamlet Program]], a similar model to the Malayan Emergency whom had opposite effects. Similarly economic and rural development formed a key strategy as part of Rural Affairs development<ref name=\":0\"/>.  While the earlier war was marked by considerable emphasis on counter-insurgency programs US forces initially relied on very little if any theoretical doctrine of counter-insurgency during the [[Joint warfare in South Vietnam, 1963\u201369#Military strategy|Ground-Intervention phase]]. Conventional warfare using massive fire-power and failure to implement adequate counter-insurgency had extremely negative effects and was the strategy whom the NVA were adept at countering through the [[Viet Cong and PAVN strategy, organization and structure#The Protracted War conflict model|protracted political and military warfare model]]. These are in part, reasons for the outright failure of U.S strategic policy in the war<ref name=\":0\"/>. Following the replacement of General [[William Westmoreland]], newer concepts were tried including a revival of earlier COIN strategies including [[Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support]]. This was alongside the brutal and oftentimes badly implemented civilian-assassination program [[Phoenix Program]] targeting Viet Cong civilian personnel. These reasons were contributing factors to the U.S failure as it had become too late by then.\n\n===British Empire===\n\n====Malaya====\nBritish forces were able to employ the relocation method with considerable success during the \"[[Malayan Emergency]]\". The [[Briggs' Plan|Briggs Plan]], implemented fully in 1950, relocated [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] [[Federation of Malaya|Malayans]] into protected \"[[New village|New Villages]]\", designated by British forces. By the end of 1951, some 400,000 ethnic Chinese had moved into the fortifications. Of this population, the British forces were able to form a \"Home Guard\", armed for resistance against the [[Malayan Communist Party]], an implementation mirrored by the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] later used by US forces in South Vietnam.<ref name=Nagl>{{Cite book\n |first = John | last = Nagl\n | title = Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife: Counterinsurgency Lessons from Malaya and Vietnam\n| publisher = Praeger Publishers\n| year = 2002\n|isbn=978-0-275-97695-8\n }}</ref><ref name=Thompson>{{Cite book\n | authorlink = Robert Grainger Ker Thompson | first = Robert | last = Thompson\n | title = Defeating Communist Insurgency: Lessons from Malaya and Vietnam\n | publisher =Chatto & Windus\n | year =1966\n | isbn=978-0-7011-1133-5\n }}</ref> Despite British claims of a victory in the Malayan Emergency, military historian [[Martin van Creveld]] noted that the end result of the counterinsurgency, namely the withdrawal of British forces and establishment of an independent state, are identical to that of [[Aden]], [[Kenya]] and [[Cyprus]], which are not considered victories.<ref>van Creveld, p. 221</ref>\n\n===Dutch Empire===\nThe Dutch formulated a new strategy of counter-insurgency warfare, during the [[Aceh War]] by deploying light-armed [[Korps Marechaussee te voet|Marechaussee]] units and using scorched earth tactics.\n\nIn 1898 [[Van Heutsz]] was proclaimed governor of Aceh, and with his lieutenant, later Dutch Prime Minister [[Hendrikus Colijn]], would finally conquer most of Aceh. They followed [[Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje|Hurgronje]]'s suggestions, finding cooperative ''uleebelang'' or secular chiefs that would support them in the countryside and isolating the resistance from their rural support base.\n\nDuring the [[South Sulawesi campaign of 1946\u20131947|South Sulawesi Campaign]] Captain [[Raymond Westerling]] of the [[Korps Speciale Troepen|KST]], Special Forces of the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] used the '''Westerling Method'''. Westerling ordered the registration of all Javanese arriving in Makassar due to the large numbers of Javanese participating in the Sulawesi resistance. He also used scouts to infiltrate local villages and to identify members of the resistance.<ref>http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/19/westerling039s-war.html</ref>\n\nBased on their information and that of the Dutch military intelligence service, the DST surrounded one of more suspected villages during night, after which they drove the population to a central location. At daybreak, the operation began, often led by Westerling. Men would be separated from women and children. From the gathered information Westerling exposed certain people as terrorists and murderers. They were shot without any further investigation. Afterwards Westerling forced local communities to refrain from supporting guerillas by swearing on the Quran and established local self-defence units with some members recruited from former guerrillas deemed as \"redeemable\".\n\nWesterling directed eleven operations throughout the campaign. He succeeded in eliminating the insurgency and undermining local support for the Republicans. His actions restored Dutch rule in southern Sulawesi. However, the Netherlands East Indies government and the Dutch army command soon realised that Westerling's notoriety led to growing public criticism. In April 1947 the Dutch government instituted an official inquiry of his controversial methods. Raymond Westerling was put on the sidelines. He was relieved of his duties in November 1948.\n\n===France===\n{{Tone|date=February 2020}}\nFrance had major counterinsurgency wars in its [[colonies]] in [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]].

The 1957 [[Battle of Algiers (1957)|Battle of Algiers]] resulted in 24,000 detentions, with most [[torture]]d and an estimated 3,000 killed.

This contributes to the difficulty that foreign, as opposed to indigenous, powers have in counter-insurgent operations.\nOne of France's most influential theorists was [[Roger Trinquier]]. The ''Modern Warfare'' counterinsurgency strategy described by Trinquier, who had led [[anti-communist]] guerrillas in [[Indochina]], was a strong influence on French efforts in Algeria.\n\nTrinquier suggested three principles:\n# separate the guerrilla from the population that supports him;\n# occupy the zones that the guerrillas previously operated from, making the area dangerous for the insurgents and turning the people against the guerrilla movement; and\n# coordinate actions over a wide area and for a long enough time that the guerrilla is denied access to the population centres that could support him.\n\nTrinquier's view was that [[torture]] had to be extremely focused and limited, but many French officers considered its use corrosive to its own side. There were strong protests among French leaders: the Army's most decorated officer, General [[Jacques P\u00e2ris de Bollardi\u00e8re]], confronted General [[Jacques Massu]], the commander of French forces in the Battle of Algiers, over orders institutionalizing torture, as \"an unleashing of deplorable instincts which no longer knew any limits.\" He issued an open letter condemning the danger to the army of the loss of its moral values \"under the fallacious pretext of immediate expediency\", and was imprisoned for sixty days.<ref name=McClintock-2005 />\n\nAs some of the French Army protested, other parts increased the intensity of their approach, which led to an attempted [[military coup]] against the [[French Fourth Republic]] itself. Massu and General [[Raoul Salan]] led a 1958 coup in [[Algiers]], demanding a new Republic under [[Charles de Gaulle]]. When de Gaulle's policies toward Algeria, such as a 1961 referendum on Algerian self-determination, did not meet the expectations of the colonial officers, Salan formed the underground [[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] (OAS), a [[right-wing]] terrorist group, whose actions included a 1962 assassination attempt against de Gaulle himself.\n\n====West Africa====\nFrance has had taken [[Insurgency#Barnett and connecting to the core|Barnett's Leviathan role]]<ref name=Barnett>{{cite book\n | author = Barnett, Thomas P.M.\n | authorlink = Thomas P.M.

Pesante Sr. Memorial Hospital, Co.''' (abbreviated as '''APSMHC''' or simply '''Pesante Hospital''') is now a 98-bed capacity tertiary [[Philippine Health Insurance Corporation|PhilHealth]] accredited  [[private hospital]] located in [[Midsayap]], [[Cotabato]] that caters the health needs of the people of [[Legislative districts of Cotabato#1st District|PPALMA area]].\n\n==Background==\nAnecito Trestiza Pesante, Sr., lived modestly with his family in the medium-sized town of [[Midsayap]], [[Cotabato]], then with a population of only 84,041. They run a family-owned sari-sari store that sells dry goods and manage a farm. The family had strong ties with the rural community; one that depended on land for livelihood. Farming wasn\u2019t a particularly lucrative business, soothe people would purchase goods from then Pesante Store using barter system, during harvest season, the family acquired money in exchange for chickens and vegetables.\n\nJanet Pesante recalls an instance of complaining to her father that it was too hot and they need to buy an electric fan, \u201cyou could live without a fan, but not without an education\u201d her father whipped. Their father\u2019s strong emphasis on the importance of education couldn\u2019t be doubted for he have sent his children to private schools despite of tremendous financial challenge that paid big dividends.\n\nIn 1985, Evelyn Pesante, the second child completed her medical school and opened a small clinic in their house in November 1986. A few months later, due to the high demand for hospital services and the increase number of patients, the clinic was moved to a bigger and more strategic location in the public market area. She called her new place as Holy Family Medical Clinic, named after her college dormitory and the street of the former subdivision she lived in. The clinic catered mostly for consultations, as there were only five midwives. Meanwhile, Mr. Pesante Sr., with his background in running a business, was in-charge in the records and accounting section of the clinic. It has only five beds, later upgraded to eight beds available for patients who needed to be admitted.\n\nDr. Evelyn Pesante, who understood the importance of education as much as her father did, worked hard to help send her siblings to school. Eventually, Mr. Pesante Sr. became ill with cancer, the sickness that took his life in 1989. As he lay on his deathbed, he called each of his children to his bedside to leave his last request and wish. Once completed, he was at peace to die.\n\nIn 1995, a huge destructive fire in the public market site affected the operation of the clinic. At the same year, Ramon Pesante, the third child, finished his medical school. He trained at Cotabato Regional and Medical Center, where he specialized in surgery. With the combined efforts of Dr. Evelyn Pesante and Dr. Ramon Pesante, they henceforth moved back to their house, in which they developed to establish the Pesante Surgical and Medical Emergency Clinic. It has a laboratory, an emergency room, an operation room, a delivery room and a capacity of fifteen to twenty beds, but it had remained a clinic that was only for admissions, consultations, and out-patients at that time.\n\nIn the year 2000, due to the Department of Health\u2019s stringent requirements, the clinic did not get the permission to upgrade to a primary hospital. This was also the time when Dr. Ramon Pesante started to settle with his own family; he put up his own clinic where he performs minor surgical procedures. Hence, Dr. Evelyn Pesante also had her own humble clinic that could attend patients for observation for at least twenty-four hours; after this they referred to higher hospitals when necessary.\n\nThe three youngest children, Alex, Janet, and Ron Pesante all became Registered Nurses and moved to the United States. On one of their vacation to their hometown, the family gathered and talk about the idea of construction of the hospital that their late father wished for on his deathbed. Since, for a family of medical professionals, it only made sense they couldn\u2019t have been better way for them to serve their community. This was when they started planting the seed that would grow to be the Anecito T. Pesante, Sr. Memorial Hospital, Co. that stands today.\n\nThe three children abroad, worked hard to fund the hospital. In December 2005, marks the start of construction with the demolition of the family\u2019s ancestral house building. The original plan was to build only two-storey hospital, but they trashed this and went on to build a four-storey hospital, having realized the need for a bigger hospital in PPALMA area that would serve more people. This idea was especially fuelled when the floor plan for the hospital was finally approved by the Department of Health in Manila.\n\nThe construction took a short hiatus due to financial constrains, but roughly after three years, the first three storeys were finished, opening to the public on May 8, 2008 with hospital instruments and equipments came on the way from the States. {{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Medical / clinical services==\n* [[Emergency Medicine]]\n* [[Internal Medicine]]\n* [[General Surgery]]\n* [[Orthopedics]]\n* [[Pediatrics]]\n* [[Obstetrics and Gynecology]]\n* [[Anesthesiology]]\n* [[Ophthalmology]]\n* [[Dentistry]]\n* [[Otorhinolaryngology|ENT]]\n* [[Radiology]]\n* [[Pathology]]\n* [[Family Medicine]]\n* [[General Practice]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of hospitals in Philippines]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n[[Category:Hospitals in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Cotabato]]\n", "text_old": "{{unref|date=January 2017}}\n\n{{Infobox hospital\n| Name        = Anecito T.

(abbreviated as '''APSMHC''' or simply '''Pesante Hospital''') is now a 98-bed capacity tertiary [[Philippine Health Insurance Corporation|PhilHealth]] accredited  [[private hospital]] located in [[Midsayap]], [[Cotabato]] that caters the health needs of the people of [[Legislative districts of Cotabato#1st District|PPALMA area]].\n\n==Background==\nAnecito Trestiza Pesante, Sr., lived modestly with his family in the medium-sized town of [[Midsayap]], [[Cotabato]], then with a population of only 84,041. They run a family-owned sari-sari store that sells dry goods and manage a farm. The family had strong ties with the rural community; one that depended on land for livelihood. Farming wasn\u2019t a particularly lucrative business, soothe people would purchase goods from then Pesante Store using barter system, during harvest season, the family acquired money in exchange for chickens and vegetables.\n\nJanet Pesante recalls an instance of complaining to her father that it was too hot and they need to buy an electric fan, \u201cyou could live without a fan, but not without an education\u201d her father whipped. Their father\u2019s strong emphasis on the importance of education couldn\u2019t be doubted for he have sent his children to private schools despite of tremendous financial challenge that paid big dividends.\n\nIn 1985, Evelyn Pesante, the second child completed her medical school and opened a small clinic in their house in November 1986. A few months later, due to the high demand for hospital services and the increase number of patients, the clinic was moved to a bigger and more strategic location in the public market area. She called her new place as Holy Family Medical Clinic, named after her college dormitory and the street of the former subdivision she lived in. The clinic catered mostly for consultations, as there were only five midwives. Meanwhile, Mr. Pesante Sr., with his background in running a business, was in-charge in the records and accounting section of the clinic. It has only five beds, later upgraded to eight beds available for patients who needed to be admitted.\n\nDr. Evelyn Pesante, who understood the importance of education as much as her father did, worked hard to help send her siblings to school. Eventually, Mr. Pesante Sr. became ill with cancer, the sickness that took his life in 1989. As he lay on his deathbed, he called each of his children to his bedside to leave his last request and wish. Once completed, he was at peace to die.\n\nIn 1995, a huge destructive fire in the public market site affected the operation of the clinic. At the same year, Ramon Pesante, the third child, finished his medical school. He trained at Cotabato Regional and Medical Center, where he specialized in surgery. With the combined efforts of Dr. Evelyn Pesante and Dr. Ramon Pesante, they henceforth moved back to their house, in which they developed to establish the Pesante Surgical and Medical Emergency Clinic. It has a laboratory, an emergency room, an operation room, a delivery room and a capacity of fifteen to twenty beds, but it had remained a clinic that was only for admissions, consultations, and out-patients at that time.\n\nIn the year 2000, due to the Department of Health\u2019s stringent requirements, the clinic did not get the permission to upgrade to a primary hospital. This was also the time when Dr. Ramon Pesante started to settle with his own family; he put up his own clinic where he performs minor surgical procedures. Hence, Dr. Evelyn Pesante also had her own humble clinic that could attend patients for observation for at least twenty-four hours; after this they referred to higher hospitals when necessary.\n\nThe three youngest children, Alex, Janet, and Ron Pesante all became Registered Nurses and moved to the United States. On one of their vacation to their hometown, the family gathered and talk about the idea of construction of the hospital that their late father wished for on his deathbed. Since, for a family of medical professionals, it only made sense they couldn\u2019t have been better way for them to serve their community. This was when they started planting the seed that would grow to be the Anecito T. Pesante, Sr. Memorial Hospital, Co. that stands today.\n\nThe three children abroad, worked hard to fund the hospital. In December 2005, marks the start of construction with the demolition of the family\u2019s ancestral house building. The original plan was to build only two-storey hospital, but they trashed this and went on to build a four-storey hospital, having realized the need for a bigger hospital in PPALMA area that would serve more people. This idea was especially fuelled when the floor plan for the hospital was finally approved by the Department of Health in Manila.\n\nThe construction took a short hiatus due to financial constrains, but roughly after three years, the first three storeys were finished, opening to the public on May 8, 2008 with hospital instruments and equipments came on the way from the States. {{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Medical / clinical services==\n* [[Emergency Medicine]]\n* [[Internal Medicine]]\n* [[General Surgery]]\n* [[Orthopedics]]\n* [[Pediatrics]]\n* [[Obstetrics and Gynecology]]\n* [[Anesthesiology]]\n* [[Ophthalmology]]\n* [[Dentistry]]\n* [[Otorhinolaryngology|ENT]]\n* [[Radiology]]\n* [[Pathology]]\n* [[Family Medicine]]\n* [[General Practice]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of hospitals in Philippines]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord missing|Philippines}}\n\n[[Category:Hospitals in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Cotabato]]\n", "name_user": "Sanglahi86", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed old tag.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecito_T._Pesante_Sr._Memorial_Hospital_Co."}
