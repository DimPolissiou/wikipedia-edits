It had two 16bit computers connected to [[Online service]] networks through telephone lines. Online service users\u2019 offline meetings were held in the ''Electronic Caf\u00e9'', which served as a place that connected online and offline activities. The opening of the online caf\u00e9 in Korea was 2\u20133 years ahead of other countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eng.i-museum.or.kr/jsp/sub02/article_list.jsp?no=2&pageIndex=2# |title=Cyber Internet History Museum |publisher=Eng.i-museum.or.kr |date=2009-09-24 |accessdate=2013-11-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109230917/http://eng.i-museum.or.kr/jsp/sub02/article_list.jsp?no=2 |archivedate=2015-01-09 }}</ref>\n\nThe online caf\u00e9 phenomenon in the [[United States]] was started in July 1991 by Wayne Gregori in [[San Francisco]] when he began [[sf net|SFnet Coffeehouse Network]].  Gregori designed, built and installed 25 coin-operated computer terminals in [[coffeehouses]] throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. The caf\u00e9 terminals dialed into a 32 line [[Bulletin Board System]] that offered an array of electronic services including [[FIDOnet]] mail and, in 1992, [[Internet mail]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfnet.org |title=SFnet Archive &#124; Coffee Bar Network |publisher=Sfnet.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref> being the first company to introduce internet access (email only) in a public venue.\n==Internet cafes==\nThe concept of a caf\u00e9 with full Internet access (and the name ''Cybercaf\u00e9'') was invented in early 1994 by [[Ivan Pope]]. Commissioned to develop an Internet event for an arts weekend at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] (ICA) in London, and inspired by the SFnet terminal based cafes, Pope wrote a proposal outlining the concept of a caf\u00e9 with Internet access.\n\nAfter an initial run in late 1993 as a caf\u00e9 showcasing computers, a bar called ''CompuCaf\u00e9'' was established in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] in the spring of 1994 featuring both Internet access and a robotic beer seller.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nyt.fi/a1475035053314 |title=T\u00e4llainen oli Helsingin CompuCaf\u00e9, \"maailman ensimm\u00e4inen nettikahvila\", jota esittelev\u00e4\u00e4 videota ihastellaan nyt ulkomaillakin |publisher=Nyt | language=fi| date=2016-09-28 |accessdate=2016-09-28}}</ref>\n\nAround June 1994, [[The Binary Cafe]], Canada's first Internet caf\u00e9, opened in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]].\n\nInspired partly by the ICA event, a commercial establishment of this type, called [[Cyberia, London|Cyberia]], opened on September 1, 1994, in [[London]], [[England]].

Although computer and [[Broadband Internet access|broadband]] penetration per capita were very high, young people went to PC bangs to play multiplayer games.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Internet Cafe, Alice Springs, Australia.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Internet Cafe, [[Alice Springs]], Australia (pictured 2005)]]\nInternet caf\u00e9s are located worldwide, and many people use them when traveling to access [[webmail]] and [[instant messaging]] services to keep in touch with family and friends.  Apart from travelers, in many developing countries Internet caf\u00e9s are the primary form of Internet access for citizens as a shared-access model is more affordable than personal ownership of equipment and/or software.  A variation on the Internet caf\u00e9 [[business model]] is the LAN gaming center, used for [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] gaming.  These caf\u00e9s have several computer stations connected to a [[Local area network|LAN]]. The connected computers are custom-assembled for gameplay, supporting popular multiplayer [[video game|games]]. This is reducing the need for [[video arcade]]s and [[arcade game]]s, many of which are being closed down or merged into Internet caf\u00e9s.  The use of Internet caf\u00e9s for [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] gaming is particularly popular in certain areas of Asia like [[India]], [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]] and the [[Philippines]]. In some countries, since practically all LAN gaming centers also offer Internet access, the terms net cafe and LAN gaming center have become interchangeable. Again, this shared-access model is more affordable than personal ownership of equipment and/or software, especially since games often require high end and expensive PCs.\n\nThere are also [[Internet kiosk]]s, Internet access points in [[public place]]s like [[public libraries]], [[airport]] halls, sometimes just for brief use while standing.\n\nMany hotels, resorts, and cruise ships offer Internet access for the convenience of their guests; this can take various forms, such as in-room wireless access, or a web browser that uses the in-room television set for its display (usually in this case the hotel provides a wireless keyboard on the assumption that the guest will use it from the bed), or computer(s) that guests can use, either in the lobby or in a business center. As with telephone service, in the US most mid-price hotels offer Internet access from a computer in the lobby to registered guests without charging an additional fee, while fancier hotels are more likely to charge for the use of a computer in their \"business center.\"\n\nFor those traveling by road in North America, many [[truck stop]]s have Internet kiosks, for which a typical charge is around 20 cents per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fjcomm.com/internet-webstations.asp |title=Internet Web Stations |accessdate=2007-12-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013201446/http://fjcomm.com/internet-webstations.asp |archivedate=2007-10-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nInternet caf\u00e9s come in a wide range of styles, reflecting their location, main clientele, and sometimes, the social agenda of the proprietors. In the early days they were important in projecting the image of the Internet as a 'cool' phenomenon.\n\n==Evolution==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\nInternet caf\u00e9s are a natural evolution of the traditional [[caf\u00e9]]. Caf\u00e9s started as places for information exchange, and have always been used as places to read the paper, send postcards home, play traditional or electronic games, chat to friends, find out local information.\n\nAs Internet access is in increasing demand, many pubs, bars and caf\u00e9s have terminals, so the distinction between the Internet caf\u00e9 and normal caf\u00e9 is eroded. In some, particularly [[Europe]]an countries, the number of pure Internet caf\u00e9s is decreasing since more and more normal caf\u00e9s offer the same services. However, there are European countries where the total number of publicly accessible terminals is also decreasing. An example of such a country is [[Germany]]. The cause of this development is a combination of complicated regulation, relatively high Internet penetration rates, the widespread use of notebooks, tablets and smartphones and the relatively high number of [[hotspot (Wi-Fi)|wireless internet hotspots]]. Many pubs, bars and caf\u00e9s in Germany offer wireless internet, but no terminals since the Internet caf\u00e9 regulations do not apply if no terminal is offered. Additionally, the use of Internet caf\u00e9s for multiplayer gaming is very difficult in Germany since the Internet caf\u00e9 regulations and a second type of regulations which was originally established for video arcade centres applies to this kind of Internet caf\u00e9s. It is, for example, forbidden for people under the age of 18 to enter such an Internet caf\u00e9, although particularly people under 18 are an important group of customers for this type of Internet caf\u00e9.\n\nWhile most Internet caf\u00e9s are private businesses many have been set up to help bridge the '[[digital divide]]', providing computer access and training to those without home access. For example, the UK government has supported the setting up of 6000 telecentres.\n\nIn Asia, gaming is very popular at the Internet caf\u00e9s. This popularity has helped create a strong demand and a sustainable revenue model for most Internet caf\u00e9s. With growing popularity, there also comes with this a responsibility as well. In fighting for competitive market share, the Internet caf\u00e9s have started charging less and hence are adopting alternate means to maximize revenue. This includes selling food, beverages, game and telephone cards to its patrons.\n\nBy 2010, a variation of the internet caf\u00e9 known as a \"[[sweepstakes parlor]]\" had become widespread in certain regions of the United States. These facilities offer entries in a contest to customers who purchase internet usage. The result of the customers' entries are revealed using software installed on the computer terminals, which may simulate the appearance and operation of casino games such as a [[slot machine]]. Although meant to resemble it, these sweepstakes and software are designed in such a way that they could legally be considered [[sweepstakes]] rather than [[gambling]]. Sweepstakes parlors have faced scrutiny by local governments, who have argued that despite arguments claiming otherwise, sweepstakes parlors are a form of illegal gambling, and their patrons are more interested in playing the sweepstakes than actually using their purchased internet time. A large number of these locations have faced raids by officials, while a number of states have enacted laws meant to ban them.<ref name=wsj1>{{cite news|last=Eder|first=Steve|title=Gambling Raids Hit Cafes|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443713704577601951019591954|accessdate=10 January 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=August 22, 2012}}</ref><ref name=casinonxtdr>{{cite journal|last=Gillette|first=Felix|title=The Casino Next Door|journal=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=April 21, 2011|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_18/b4226076180073.htm|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=NYTimes_cafesthrive>{{cite news|last=Saulny|first=Susan|title='Sweepstakes' Cafes Thrive, Despite Police Misgivings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/07/us/07gambling.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|accessdate=10 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Legal issues==\n[[Image:Firenze-Internet-cafe-0836.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A notice about anti-terrorism related ID requirements on the door of an Italian Internet caf\u00e9.

As Australia's first Internet caf\u00e9, founders included Gavin Murray, [[Rita Arrigo]] and [[Christopher Beaumont]]. Direct from London's Cyberia they were joined by Kathryn Phelps and partnerships with Adam Goudie of Standard Computers for hardware and Michael Bethune from Australia Online, Australia's first ISP for of course their Internet access. In 1995 it was delivered via a standard analogue phone line using a 9600-Baud US Robotics Modem. Cafe.on.net also opened on Rundle Street in Adelaide in 1995, with the support of Internode's Simon Hackett.\n\n=== Brazil ===\nIn Brazil, the initial concept brought by Monkey Paulista was based on the business model used by Internet caf\u00e9s in South Korea, since this was the first house LAN to exist in Brazil, inaugurated in S\u00e3o Paulo, starting its activities in 1998. The company closed in 2010. However, just a week later for reasons of bureaucracy, the company Lan Game @ The House<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taglan.blogspot.com/ |title=The @ Game |publisher=Taglan.blogspot.com |date=2011-07-19 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref> was opened and today is the first LAN house of Brazil in activity. Today it is seen as the country as a way to test new technologies and demonstration of games and products.\n\n=== Mainland China ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\nAccording to the \"Survey of China Internet Caf\u00e9 Industry\" by the [[Ministry of Culture (People's Republic of China)|People's Republic of China Ministry of Culture]] in 2005, Mainland China has 110,000 Internet caf\u00e9s, with more than 1,000,000 employees contributing 18,500,000,000 [[Renminbi|yuan]] to P.R. China's GDP. More than 70% of Internet caf\u00e9 visitors are from 18 to 30 years old.  90% are male, 65% are unmarried, and 54% hold a university degree. More than 70% of visitors play computer games. 20% of China's Internet users go to Internet caf\u00e9s.\n\nInternet cafes allow individuals to go about the Internet anonymous, faster, and cheaper than at home. Large Internet cafes of major cities in China are expensive and heavily regulated by Government officials. Large Internet cafes are used by wealthy elite for business transactions and social gatherings.  The majority of Internet cafes are small privately owned cafes comprising 90% of the market. (China Tightening Control, 2003) The majority of Internet cafes are unregistered because they do not meet the requirements of government standards or they do not want to go through the lengthy process of registering. According to Hong and Huang only 200 out of 2,400 cafes are registered in Beijing. The Chinese government is cracking down on the number of unregistered Internet cafes because some users spread propaganda, slander, allow pornography, and allow underage users.  Crack downs by Chinese Government Officials banned 17,488 Internet Cafes in 2002 and another 27,000 were banned in 2003. (J. Hong, L. Huang) Internet cafes that are getting closed are being replaced with government approved businesses. These pre-approved businesses monitor patrons\u2019 activities and help the government crackdown on offending users. (Xiao, 2003; Qiu 2003)\n\nMilestones:\n* Before 1995 \u2013 An Internet caf\u00e9 called 3C+T appeared in Shanghai, probably the first in China. The price was 20 [[renminbi|yuan]] per hour ($2.50 per hour)\n* 1995\u20131998 \u2013 China's Internet caf\u00e9s proliferate. Playing unconnected games is the main purpose of caf\u00e9 users. The average price was 15~20 yuan per hour.\n* After 2002 \u2013 Heavy censorships were imposed, including real-name registration. At the end of 2004, more than 70,000 Internet caf\u00e9s were closed in a nationwide campaign.\n* 2008 \u2013 Microsoft attempts to make Internet caf\u00e9s profitable in Asia and other emerging markets. After discussions with the governments of these countries, it helps to establish safe Internet caf\u00e9s.\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], Internet caf\u00e9s used by traveling people and business are declining since the arrival of widespread mobile Internet usage. A set of other services are also offered, such as printing of documents or webpages. Operators also help computer illiterates through some government processes (as a part of e-governance in India ). Low speed of mobile Internet and these services offered by Internet caf\u00e9s help its survival. In India a positive government ID is compulsory for Internet caf\u00e9 users in most states.\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nAccording to APWKomitel<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apwkomitel.org/ |title=Home of APWKOMITEL |publisher=Apwkomitel.org |accessdate=2012-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126184026/http://www.apwkomitel.org/ |archive-date=2012-01-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (Association of Community Internet Center), there are 5,000 Internet caf\u00e9s in urban Indonesian cities in 2006 providing computer/printer/scanner rentals, training, PC gaming and Internet access/rental to people without computer or internet access.

In urban areas, the generic name is [[:id:Warnet|warnet]] (or ''warung internet'') and in rural areas the generic name is telecenter. Warnets/netcafes are usually privately owned as bottom-up initiatives, while telecenters in rural villages are typically government or donor-funded as top-down financing. Information on netcafe/warnet in Indonesia can also be found in a book titled: ''Connected for Development: Indonesian Case study''.<ref>[http://www.i4donline.net/ATF/2007/fullpapers/Rudi_ATF07ABS129.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809173647/http://www.i4donline.net/ATF/2007/fullpapers/Rudi_ATF07ABS129.pdf |date=August 9, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nCurrently, no special license is required to operate an Internet caf\u00e9 or warnet in Indonesia, except for the ordinary business license applicable to cafes or small shops.

Hourly usage rate varies between Rp 2500-15000 ($0,27 - 1,60)\n\n===Japan===\nJapan has a strong Internet cafe culture, with most serving a dual purpose as joint Internet-[[manga cafe]]s. Most chains (like Media Cafe Popeye and Jiy\u016b K\u016bkan) allow offer customers a variety of seating options, including normal chair, massage chair, couch, and flat mat. Customers are then typically given unlimited access to soft drinks, [[manga]], magazines, Internet, online video games, and [[online pornography]]. Most offer food and shower services for an additional fee. In fact, many purchase \"night packs\" and shower/sleep in the cafes, giving rise to a phenomenon known as \"[[net cafe refugee]]\" or \"net cafe homeless\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Japan homeless living in internet cafes|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7953609.stm |website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|date=21 March 2009|accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Kenya===\n{{see also|Video gaming in Kenya}}\nInternet caf\u00e9s are prevalent in the city of Mombasa, as poverty and unreliable infrastructure do not make personal Internet a viable option for many citizens. The caf\u00e9s are often combined with a variety of other businesses, such as chemists, manicurists, repair shops, and convenience stores. Video gaming has become particularly profitable in Internet caf\u00e9s in Kenya in recent years.\n\n===Philippines===\n[[Image:Internet of cebu slums.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An Internet caf\u00e9 in Cebu City, Philippines.]]\nIn the [[Philippines]], Internet caf\u00e9s or better known as computer shops are found on every street in major cities and there is at least one of which in most municipalities or towns. There are also Internet caf\u00e9s in coffee shops and malls. High-end restaurants and fast food chains also provide free broadband to diners. Rates range from P10 ($0.20) on streets, up to P100 ($2) in malls.\nIn some major cities with existing ordinances regulating Internet caf\u00e9s (e.g. Valenzuela, Marikina, Davao, Lapu-lapu and Zamboanga), students who are below 18 years of age are prohibited from playing computer games during regular class hours. Depending on the city, regulations varies on their exact details and implementation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icafeproject.com/internet-cafe-city-ordinance/ |title=Internet Cafe City Ordinance - Philippines |publisher=iCafeProject |date=2012-06-19 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref> Such city ordinances usually also requires Internet caf\u00e9 owners to:\n* Install filtering software to block adult oriented sites\n* Prohibit the sales of alcoholic drinks and cigarettes inside their establishment\n* Allow open view of rented computers (i.e. no closed cubicles)\n* Front wall panel is 50% transparent to allow a clear view of the interior of the establishment\n* Adequate lighting both inside and outside of the establishment to allow a clear view of the interior at all times\n\n===Poland===\nThe first Internet caf\u00e9 in [[Poland]] was opened in 1996. Such establishments soon became very popular among the Polish population, especially young people, who at the time still rarely had access to computers with high-speed Internet at home. They were commonly used to play games like [[Icy Tower]] or [[Counter-Strike]], as well as for instant messaging on the [[Gadu-Gadu]] client. Internet caf\u00e9s began losing popularity after [[Telekomunikacja Polska]] launched the ADSL ''Neostrada'' service in 2001, providing home Internet access to many Poles, and most establishments were shut down by the 2010s.\n\n=== Slovakia ===\nIn [[Slovakia]], the first Internet caf\u00e9 was opened officially in the city of [[Ko\u0161ice]] on July 17, 1996, providing services such as e-mail, Gopher, News, Telnet, WWW, Talk and others to the general public.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sme.sk/c/2087146/v-kosiciach-oficialne-otvorili-internet-cafe-s-pristupom-do-celosvetovej-pocitacovej-siete.html|title=V Ko\u0161iciach ofici\u00e1lne otvorili Internet Caf\u00e9 s pr\u00edstupom do celosvetovej po\u010d\u00edta\u010dovej siete|last=a.s.|first=Petit Press|work=www.sme.sk|access-date=2018-08-10|language=sk}}</ref>\n\n===South Korea===\n{{Main|PC bang}}\nIn [[South Korea]], Internet caf\u00e9s are called [[PC bang]]s.<ref>In [[Korean (language)|Korean]], \"[[Bang (Korean)|bang]]\" ([[Hangul|Hangeul]]: \ubc29; [[Hanja]]: \u623f) means \"room\", so the term literally means ''PC room''.</ref> They are ubiquitous in South Korean cities, numbering over 20,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/06/08/technology/business2_futureboy0608/index.htm|title=The future is in South Korea|publisher=CNN|date=2006-06-14|accessdate=2007-12-21 | first=Chris | last=Taylor}}</ref> PC bangs mostly cater to online game playing for the younger generation.

The first character literally means \"net\" and the second character is the first syllable of \"caf\u00e9.\"The rate is consistent at about NT$10~20 in the most part, but prominent districts, such as the [[Eastern District of Taipei]], can charge users up to NT$35 per hour. With the growth of [[smartphone]] ownership and free [[Wi-Fi]] networks in all major public attractions, the Internet caf\u00e9s now primarily cater to gamers, and some even provide food and drinks.\n\n[[Image:Cyber Cafe in Mombasa, Kenya, Nov 2013.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An Internet caf\u00e9 in Mombasa, Kenya, combined with other services.]]\n\n===Vietnam===\nIn [[Vietnam]], almost every Internet caf\u00e9s advertises themselves as game centers. Many Internet caf\u00e9s charges a fairly cheap fee, usually $0.1 - $0.25 an hour. Services such as food and drink are also often available.\nInternet caf\u00e9 in Vietnamese is ''qu\u00e1n net'' or ''ti\u1ec7m net'' (''qu\u00e1n'' or ''ti\u1ec7m'' means ''store'' and ''net'' is ''internet'').\n\n===United States===\nReputedly, the first [[kosher]] cybercafe was the [[IDT Cafe]] in New York City's diamond district, opened in the spring of 1997.<ref name=chen>{{cite news |url= http://www.stolaf.edu/people/leming/soc265rel/news/Feb_20.html |title= First, there was the cybercafe.

Although computer and [[Broadband Internet access|broadband]] penetration per capita were very high, young people went to PC bangs to play multiplayer games.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Internet Cafe, Alice Springs, Australia.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Internet Cafe, [[Alice Springs]], Australia (pictured 2005)]]\nInternet caf\u00e9s are located worldwide, and many people use them when traveling to access [[webmail]] and [[instant messaging]] services to keep in touch with family and friends.  Apart from travelers, in many developing countries Internet caf\u00e9s are the primary form of Internet access for citizens as a shared-access model is more affordable than personal ownership of equipment and/or software.  A variation on the Internet caf\u00e9 [[business model]] is the LAN gaming center, used for [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] gaming.  These caf\u00e9s have several computer stations connected to a [[Local area network|LAN]]. The connected computers are custom-assembled for gameplay, supporting popular multiplayer [[video game|games]]. This is reducing the need for [[video arcade]]s and [[arcade game]]s, many of which are being closed down or merged into Internet caf\u00e9s.  The use of Internet caf\u00e9s for [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] gaming is particularly popular in certain areas of Asia like [[India]], [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]] and the [[Philippines]]. In some countries, since practically all LAN gaming centers also offer Internet access, the terms net cafe and LAN gaming center have become interchangeable. Again, this shared-access model is more affordable than personal ownership of equipment and/or software, especially since games often require high end and expensive PCs.\n\nThere are also [[Internet kiosk]]s, Internet access points in [[public place]]s like [[public libraries]], [[airport]] halls, sometimes just for brief use while standing.\n\nMany hotels, resorts, and cruise ships offer Internet access for the convenience of their guests; this can take various forms, such as in-room wireless access, or a web browser that uses the in-room television set for its display (usually in this case the hotel provides a wireless keyboard on the assumption that the guest will use it from the bed), or computer(s) that guests can use, either in the lobby or in a business center. As with telephone service, in the US most mid-price hotels offer Internet access from a computer in the lobby to registered guests without charging an additional fee, while fancier hotels are more likely to charge for the use of a computer in their \"business center.\"\n\nFor those traveling by road in North America, many [[truck stop]]s have Internet kiosks, for which a typical charge is around 20 cents per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fjcomm.com/internet-webstations.asp |title=Internet Web Stations |accessdate=2007-12-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013201446/http://fjcomm.com/internet-webstations.asp |archivedate=2007-10-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nInternet caf\u00e9s come in a wide range of styles, reflecting their location, main clientele, and sometimes, the social agenda of the proprietors. In the early days they were important in projecting the image of the Internet as a 'cool' phenomenon.\n\n==Evolution==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\nInternet caf\u00e9s are a natural evolution of the traditional [[caf\u00e9]]. Caf\u00e9s started as places for information exchange, and have always been used as places to read the paper, send postcards home, play traditional or electronic games, chat to friends, find out local information.\n\nAs Internet access is in increasing demand, many pubs, bars and caf\u00e9s have terminals, so the distinction between the Internet caf\u00e9 and normal caf\u00e9 is eroded. In some, particularly [[Europe]]an countries, the number of pure Internet caf\u00e9s is decreasing since more and more normal caf\u00e9s offer the same services. However, there are European countries where the total number of publicly accessible terminals is also decreasing. An example of such a country is [[Germany]]. The cause of this development is a combination of complicated regulation, relatively high Internet penetration rates, the widespread use of notebooks, tablets and smartphones and the relatively high number of [[hotspot (Wi-Fi)|wireless internet hotspots]]. Many pubs, bars and caf\u00e9s in Germany offer wireless internet, but no terminals since the Internet caf\u00e9 regulations do not apply if no terminal is offered. Additionally, the use of Internet caf\u00e9s for multiplayer gaming is very difficult in Germany since the Internet caf\u00e9 regulations and a second type of regulations which was originally established for video arcade centres applies to this kind of Internet caf\u00e9s. It is, for example, forbidden for people under the age of 18 to enter such an Internet caf\u00e9, although particularly people under 18 are an important group of customers for this type of Internet caf\u00e9.\n\nWhile most Internet caf\u00e9s are private businesses many have been set up to help bridge the '[[digital divide]]', providing computer access and training to those without home access. For example, the UK government has supported the setting up of 6000 telecentres.\n\nIn Asia, gaming is very popular at the Internet caf\u00e9s. This popularity has helped create a strong demand and a sustainable revenue model for most Internet caf\u00e9s. With growing popularity, there also comes with this a responsibility as well. In fighting for competitive market share, the Internet caf\u00e9s have started charging less and hence are adopting alternate means to maximize revenue. This includes selling food, beverages, game and telephone cards to its patrons.\n\nBy 2010, a variation of the internet caf\u00e9 known as a \"[[sweepstakes parlor]]\" had become widespread in certain regions of the United States. These facilities offer entries in a contest to customers who purchase internet usage. The result of the customers' entries are revealed using software installed on the computer terminals, which may simulate the appearance and operation of casino games such as a [[slot machine]]. Although meant to resemble it, these sweepstakes and software are designed in such a way that they could legally be considered [[sweepstakes]] rather than [[gambling]]. Sweepstakes parlors have faced scrutiny by local governments, who have argued that despite arguments claiming otherwise, sweepstakes parlors are a form of illegal gambling, and their patrons are more interested in playing the sweepstakes than actually using their purchased internet time. A large number of these locations have faced raids by officials, while a number of states have enacted laws meant to ban them.<ref name=wsj1>{{cite news|last=Eder|first=Steve|title=Gambling Raids Hit Cafes|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443713704577601951019591954|accessdate=10 January 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=August 22, 2012}}</ref><ref name=casinonxtdr>{{cite journal|last=Gillette|first=Felix|title=The Casino Next Door|journal=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=April 21, 2011|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_18/b4226076180073.htm|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=NYTimes_cafesthrive>{{cite news|last=Saulny|first=Susan|title='Sweepstakes' Cafes Thrive, Despite Police Misgivings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/07/us/07gambling.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|accessdate=10 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Legal issues==\n[[Image:Firenze-Internet-cafe-0836.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A notice about anti-terrorism related ID requirements on the door of an Italian Internet caf\u00e9.

As Australia's first Internet caf\u00e9, founders included Gavin Murray, [[Rita Arrigo]] and [[Christopher Beaumont]]. Direct from London's Cyberia they were joined by Kathryn Phelps and partnerships with Adam Goudie of Standard Computers for hardware and Michael Bethune from Australia Online, Australia's first ISP for of course their Internet access. In 1995 it was delivered via a standard analogue phone line using a 9600-Baud US Robotics Modem. Cafe.on.net also opened on Rundle Street in Adelaide in 1995, with the support of Internode's Simon Hackett.\n\n=== Brazil ===\nIn Brazil, the initial concept brought by Monkey Paulista was based on the business model used by Internet caf\u00e9s in South Korea, since this was the first house LAN to exist in Brazil, inaugurated in S\u00e3o Paulo, starting its activities in 1998. The company closed in 2010. However, just a week later for reasons of bureaucracy, the company Lan Game @ The House<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taglan.blogspot.com/ |title=The @ Game |publisher=Taglan.blogspot.com |date=2011-07-19 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref> was opened and today is the first LAN house of Brazil in activity. Today it is seen as the country as a way to test new technologies and demonstration of games and products.\n\n=== Mainland China ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\nAccording to the \"Survey of China Internet Caf\u00e9 Industry\" by the [[Ministry of Culture (People's Republic of China)|People's Republic of China Ministry of Culture]] in 2005, Mainland China has 110,000 Internet caf\u00e9s, with more than 1,000,000 employees contributing 18,500,000,000 [[Renminbi|yuan]] to P.R. China's GDP. More than 70% of Internet caf\u00e9 visitors are from 18 to 30 years old.  90% are male, 65% are unmarried, and 54% hold a university degree. More than 70% of visitors play computer games. 20% of China's Internet users go to Internet caf\u00e9s.\n\nInternet cafes allow individuals to go about the Internet anonymous, faster, and cheaper than at home. Large Internet cafes of major cities in China are expensive and heavily regulated by Government officials. Large Internet cafes are used by wealthy elite for business transactions and social gatherings.  The majority of Internet cafes are small privately owned cafes comprising 90% of the market. (China Tightening Control, 2003) The majority of Internet cafes are unregistered because they do not meet the requirements of government standards or they do not want to go through the lengthy process of registering. According to Hong and Huang only 200 out of 2,400 cafes are registered in Beijing. The Chinese government is cracking down on the number of unregistered Internet cafes because some users spread propaganda, slander, allow pornography, and allow underage users.  Crack downs by Chinese Government Officials banned 17,488 Internet Cafes in 2002 and another 27,000 were banned in 2003. (J. Hong, L. Huang) Internet cafes that are getting closed are being replaced with government approved businesses. These pre-approved businesses monitor patrons\u2019 activities and help the government crackdown on offending users. (Xiao, 2003; Qiu 2003)\n\nMilestones:\n* Before 1995 \u2013 An Internet caf\u00e9 called 3C+T appeared in Shanghai, probably the first in China. The price was 20 [[renminbi|yuan]] per hour ($2.50 per hour)\n* 1995\u20131998 \u2013 China's Internet caf\u00e9s proliferate. Playing unconnected games is the main purpose of caf\u00e9 users. The average price was 15~20 yuan per hour.\n* After 2002 \u2013 Heavy censorships were imposed, including real-name registration. At the end of 2004, more than 70,000 Internet caf\u00e9s were closed in a nationwide campaign.\n* 2008 \u2013 Microsoft attempts to make Internet caf\u00e9s profitable in Asia and other emerging markets. After discussions with the governments of these countries, it helps to establish safe Internet caf\u00e9s.\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], Internet caf\u00e9s used by traveling people and business are declining since the arrival of widespread mobile Internet usage. A set of other services are also offered, such as printing of documents or webpages. Operators also help computer illiterates through some government processes (as a part of e-governance in India ). Low speed of mobile Internet and these services offered by Internet caf\u00e9s help its survival. In India a positive government ID is compulsory for Internet caf\u00e9 users in most states.\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nAccording to APWKomitel<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apwkomitel.org/ |title=Home of APWKOMITEL |publisher=Apwkomitel.org |accessdate=2012-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126184026/http://www.apwkomitel.org/ |archive-date=2012-01-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (Association of Community Internet Center), there are 5,000 Internet caf\u00e9s in urban Indonesian cities in 2006 providing computer/printer/scanner rentals, training, PC gaming and Internet access/rental to people without computer or internet access.

In urban areas, the generic name is [[:id:Warnet|warnet]] (or ''warung internet'') and in rural areas the generic name is telecenter. Warnets/netcafes are usually privately owned as bottom-up initiatives, while telecenters in rural villages are typically government or donor-funded as top-down financing.

Most chains (like Media Cafe Popeye and Jiy\u016b K\u016bkan) allow offer customers a variety of seating options, including normal chair, massage chair, couch, and flat mat. Customers are then typically given unlimited access to soft drinks, [[manga]], magazines, Internet, online video games, and [[online pornography]]. Most offer food and shower services for an additional fee. In fact, many purchase \"night packs\" and shower/sleep in the cafes, giving rise to a phenomenon known as \"[[net cafe refugee]]\" or \"net cafe homeless\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Japan homeless living in internet cafes|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7953609.stm |website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|date=21 March 2009|accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Kenya===\n{{see also|Video gaming in Kenya}}\nInternet caf\u00e9s are prevalent in the city of Mombasa, as poverty and unreliable infrastructure do not make personal Internet a viable option for many citizens. The caf\u00e9s are often combined with a variety of other businesses, such as chemists, manicurists, repair shops, and convenience stores. Video gaming has become particularly profitable in Internet caf\u00e9s in Kenya in recent years.\n\n===Philippines===\n[[Image:Internet of cebu slums.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An Internet caf\u00e9 in Cebu City, Philippines.]]\nIn the [[Philippines]], Internet caf\u00e9s or better known as computer shops are found on every street in major cities and there is at least one of which in most municipalities or towns. There are also Internet caf\u00e9s in coffee shops and malls. High-end restaurants and fast food chains also provide free broadband to diners. Rates range from P10 ($0.20) on streets, up to P100 ($2) in malls.\nIn some major cities with existing ordinances regulating Internet caf\u00e9s (e.g. Valenzuela, Marikina, Davao, Lapu-lapu and Zamboanga), students who are below 18 years of age are prohibited from playing computer games during regular class hours.

Such establishments soon became very popular among the Polish population, especially young people, who at the time still rarely had access to computers with high-speed Internet at home. They were commonly used to play games like [[Icy Tower]] or [[Counter-Strike]], as well as for instant messaging on the [[Gadu-Gadu]] client. Internet caf\u00e9s began losing popularity after [[Telekomunikacja Polska]] launched the ADSL ''Neostrada'' service in 2001, providing home Internet access to many Poles, and most establishments were shut down by the 2010s.\n\n=== Slovakia ===\nIn [[Slovakia]], the first Internet caf\u00e9 was opened officially in the city of [[Ko\u0161ice]] on July 17, 1996, providing services such as e-mail, Gopher, News, Telnet, WWW, Talk and others to the general public.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sme.sk/c/2087146/v-kosiciach-oficialne-otvorili-internet-cafe-s-pristupom-do-celosvetovej-pocitacovej-siete.html|title=V Ko\u0161iciach ofici\u00e1lne otvorili Internet Caf\u00e9 s pr\u00edstupom do celosvetovej po\u010d\u00edta\u010dovej siete|last=a.s.|first=Petit Press|work=www.sme.sk|access-date=2018-08-10|language=sk}}</ref>\n\n===South Korea===\n{{Main|PC bang}}\nIn [[South Korea]], Internet caf\u00e9s are called [[PC bang]]s.<ref>In [[Korean (language)|Korean]], \"[[Bang (Korean)|bang]]\" ([[Hangul|Hangeul]]: \ubc29; [[Hanja]]: \u623f) means \"room\", so the term literally means ''PC room''.</ref> They are ubiquitous in South Korean cities, numbering over 20,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/06/08/technology/business2_futureboy0608/index.htm|title=The future is in South Korea|publisher=CNN|date=2006-06-14|accessdate=2007-12-21 | first=Chris | last=Taylor}}</ref> PC bangs mostly cater to online game playing for the younger generation.
