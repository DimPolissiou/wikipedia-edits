The title referred to a series of stages or phases that the stereo would have previously gone through. The recordings, which benefited from the previous technological advances of the firm, were processed in a ten-channel console, although later one of twenty was used. Then the mixture was recorded on four-track tape, then masterized to two channels and turned to stereophonic [[Phonograph record|vinyl records]].\n\nThe sound engineer, in close collaboration with orchestra directors and arrangers, controlled the volume of certain musical instruments or orchestral groups to enhance their presence in the recording, or caused them to move between the left and right channels. It was also processed  with electronic reverberation effects, microphone offset etc.\n\nThe sound engineers Arthur Lilley and Arthur Bannister made most of the series' recordings, but was Bannister who used sound manipulation with more exaggeration.

Set in the US state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the fictional town of Cold Sassy (based on the real city of Harmony Grove, now [[Commerce, Georgia|Commerce]]) in 1906, it follows the life of a 14-year-old boy named Will Tweedy, and explores themes such as religion, death, and social taboos. An incomplete sequel to the novel, ''Leaving Cold Sassy'', was published in 1992 after Burns' death.\n\n==Plot summary==\nOn July 5, 1906, Enoch Rucker Blakeslee announces that he intends to marry Miss Love Simpson, a milliner at his store who is years younger than he. This news shocks his family, since his wife Mattie Lou died only three weeks earlier. Rucker\u2019s daughters, Mary Willis and Loma, worry about what the gossips of Cold Sassy will think of their father\u2019s impropriety.\n\nWill Tweedy, Rucker\u2019s 14-year-old grandson and the novel's narrator, supports his grandfather\u2019s marriage. He thinks Miss Love is nice and pretty, although she comes from Baltimore and therefore is practically a Yankee. Will thinks Rucker needs someone to look after him now that Mattie Lou is gone. On the afternoon of Rucker and Miss Love's elopement, Will sneaks off to go fishing in the country, despite the fact that he is supposed to be in mourning for his grandmother. He walks across a high, narrow train trestle and nearly dies when a train speeds toward him. He survives by lying flat between the tracks so the train passes just overhead without touching him. Will becomes a sensation after his near-death experience, and the whole town comes to his house to ask him about the incident. Rucker shocks everyone by arriving with his new bride, Miss Love.\n\nThe people of Cold Sassy disapprove of Rucker\u2019s hasty marriage, and rumors spread quickly in the small town, but Will spends much time at the Blakeslee home and becomes friends with Miss Love. He likes her candid opinions and open personality. He also has a little crush on her and often spies on her. He soon learns that it's a marriage of convenience and that Rucker and Miss Love sleep in separate rooms. Miss Love tells Will that she married Rucker only because he promised to deed her the house and furniture. And Rucker married Miss Love to save on the cost of a housekeeper.\n\nClayton McAllister, Miss Love\u2019s former fianc\u00e9 from Texas, shows up one day and tries to persuade her to leave with him. He kisses her, but she sends him away contemptuously after kissing him.\n\nWill and some of his friends make a trip into the country to pick up a horse for Miss Love, camping in the mountains along the way. When they return, Will and his father Hoyt try to convince Will\u2019s mother, Mary Willis, to travel to New York. Rucker has bought the tickets to New York so Hoyt, who works for him, can go to purchase new goods for the store. At first Mary Willis refuses to go because she is in mourning, but Will and Hoyt convince her that the trip will do her good. Right after she changes her mind, Rucker decides to use the tickets himself to go to New York with Miss Love. Mary Willis is crushed, and her hatred of Miss Love increases. To take his and Mary Willis\u2019 mind off the disappointment, Hoyt buys a brand-new Cadillac and becomes Cold Sassy's first car owner. Meanwhile, Rucker and Miss Love return from New York. They're now flirtatious and affectionate with each other, and Will wonders if their marriage is becoming more of a \"real one.\" Rucker announces that he too has bought a car and intends to start selling cars in Cold Sassy.\n\nLightfoot McLendon is a classmate of Will\u2019s who lives in the impoverished section of Cold Sassy known as Mill Town. One day Will takes Lightfoot on a car ride to the cemetery, where he kisses her. A nosy neighbor sees the kiss and tells Will\u2019s parents. Outraged at Will\u2019s association with common people, Will\u2019s parents forbid him to drive the Cadillac for two months. Will gets around his punishment by driving Rucker\u2019s car. One Sunday he, Rucker, and Miss Love take a day trip into the country, where Will gives them driving lessons.\n\nOn the way back to Cold Sassy, as he tries to avoid a collision with a Ford wrecked in the middle of the road, Will crashes the car into a creek bed and damages the radiator. While they wait for a repair team, they stay with a nearby family. That night, Will overhears Rucker tell Miss Love that he loves her and wants their marriage to be real. Miss Love declares that she cannot and that no man would want her if he knew her terrible secret. When she finally tells him her secret\u2014her father raped her when she was a child\u2014he says he doesn't care and affirms his love for her.\n\nEventually, Miss Love and Rucker fall deeply in love. Will\u2019s uncle Camp Williams commits suicide, which begins a dark period in Cold Sassy. Rucker hires Will\u2019s worst enemy, Hosie Roach, to work at the store in Camp\u2019s place; because of his new income, Hosie can marry Will's beloved Lightfoot. A pair of thieves rob and beat Rucker.; he recovers from his injuries, but catches pneumonia. As he lies sick in bed, Will overhears him tell Miss Love that God provides strength and comfort to the faithful in times of trouble. Miss Love tells Will that she's pregnant, although Rucker doesn't know. Rucker dies, but his message of faith in God gives Will strength to cope. Though the town and Will's family don't accept Miss Love, she knows they'll accept her child, so she plans to stay in Cold Sassy.\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe novel was adapted into a [[TV movie]] in 1989, starring [[Richard Widmark]], [[Faye Dunaway]], and [[Neil Patrick Harris]].

The city is located in the [[Sulphur Springs Valley]], a flat and sparsely populated drainage basin dotted with seasonal lakes. The city is surrounded by Arizona's most prominent mountain ranges, including the [[Pinale\u00f1o Mountains]] and the [[Chiricahua Mountains]]. Four of Arizona's five largest mountains are located within a 65 mile radius: [[Mount Graham]] (31 miles north), [[Chiricahua Peak]] (42 miles southeast), [[Mount Lemmon]] (57 miles west), and [[Miller Peak (Arizona)|Miller Peak]] (65 miles southwest). Scores of birds including [[Sandhill Cranes]] winter in the area, with some migrating from as far away as [[Siberia]]. A very large dry lakebed, the [[Willcox Playa]], is located 5 miles south of the city. It is the remnant of the [[Pleistocene|Ice Age]]-era Lake Cochise.\n\nWillcox's high desert climate gives it large [[diurnal temperature variation]], making it ideal for [[wine]] cultivation.\n\n==History==\nOriginally known as \"Maley\", the town was founded in 1880 as a [[whistlestop]] on the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] because of its position approximately halfway between El Paso, Texas and Phoenix, Arizona. It was renamed in honor of a visit by General [[Orlando B. Willcox]] in 1889. In the early 20th century, Willcox was a national leader in [[cattle]] production. Agriculture remains important to the local economy, but [[Interstate 10]] has replaced the railroad as the major transportation link, and much of the economy is now tied to the highway, which runs immediately north of the town.\n\nWillcox is the birthplace of [[Rex Allen]], known as \"The Arizona Cowboy\", who wrote and recorded many songs, starred in several [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] during the early 1950s and in the [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]] ''[[Frontier Doctor]]'' (1958\u20131959). Parts of the 1993 American neo-noir film  ''[[Red Rock West]]'' starring [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Lara Flynn Boyle]], [[J. T. Walsh]] and [[Dennis Hopper]] were filmed in Willcox.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} A short film documentary called \"Lonesome Willcox\" released in 2018 documented the town's country music radio station [[KHIL]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nWillcox became Arizona's second federally designated wine growing region in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/travel/arizona/2016/09/13/willcox-wins-federal-designation-unique-arizona-wine-region/90094172/|title=Feds call Willcox unique Arizona wine region|first=Richard|last=Ruelas|website=azcentral}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nWillcox is located in northern Cochise County, in the [[Sulphur Springs Valley]].<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Interstate 10 serves the city with three exits and leads {{convert|35|mi}} southwest to [[Benson, Arizona]], and {{convert|74|mi}} east to [[Lordsburg, New Mexico]].

The city is located in the [[Sulphur Springs Valley]], a flat and sparsely populated drainage basin dotted with seasonal lakes. The city is surrounded by Arizona's most prominent mountain ranges, including the [[Pinale\u00f1o Mountains]] and the [[Chiricahua Mountains]]. Four of Arizona's five largest mountains are located within a 65 mile radius: [[Mount Graham]] (31 miles north), [[Chiricahua Peak]] (42 miles southeast), [[Mount Lemmon]] (57 miles west), and [[Miller Peak (Arizona)|Miller Peak]] (65 miles southwest). Scores of birds including [[Sandhill Cranes]] winter in the area, with some migrating from as far away as [[Siberia]]. A very large dry lakebed, the [[Willcox Playa]], is located 5 miles south of the city. It is the remnant of the [[Pleistocene|Ice Age]]-era Lake Cochise.\n\nWillcox's high desert climate gives it large [[diurnal temperature variation]], making it ideal for [[wine]] cultivation.\n\n==History==\nOriginally known as \"Maley\", the town was founded in 1880 as a [[whistlestop]] on the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] because of its position approximately halfway between El Paso, Texas and Phoenix, Arizona. It was renamed in honor of a visit by General [[Orlando B. Willcox]] in 1889. In the early 20th century, Willcox was a national leader in [[cattle]] production. Agriculture remains important to the local economy, but [[Interstate 10]] has replaced the railroad as the major transportation link, and much of the economy is now tied to the highway, which runs immediately north of the town.\n\nWillcox is the birthplace of [[Rex Allen]], known as \"The Arizona Cowboy\", who wrote and recorded many songs, starred in several [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] during the early 1950s and in the [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]] ''[[Frontier Doctor]]'' (1958\u20131959). Parts of the 1993 American neo-noir film  ''[[Red Rock West]]'' starring [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Lara Flynn Boyle]], [[J. T. Walsh]] and [[Dennis Hopper]] were filmed in Willcox.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} A short film documentary called \"Lonesome Willcox\" released in 2018 documented the town's country music radio station [[KHIL]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nWillcox became Arizona's second federally designated wine growing region in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/travel/arizona/2016/09/13/willcox-wins-federal-designation-unique-arizona-wine-region/90094172/|title=Feds call Willcox unique Arizona wine region|first=Richard|last=Ruelas|website=azcentral}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nWillcox is located in northern Cochise County, in the [[Sulphur Springs Valley]].<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Interstate 10 serves the city with three exits and leads {{convert|35|mi}} southwest to [[Benson, Arizona]], and {{convert|74|mi}} east to [[Lordsburg, New Mexico]].

The r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is usually one of the first items, along with a [[cover letter]] and sometimes an application for employment, which a potential [[employer]] sees regarding the job seeker and is typically used to [[Screening (economics)|screen]] applicants, often followed by an [[interview]].\n\nThe [[curriculum vitae]] (CV) used for employment purposes in the UK (and in other European countries) is more akin to the r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u2014a shorter, summary version of one's education and experience\u2014than to the longer and more detailed CV that is expected in U.S. academic circles.\n\nIn South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, [[biodata]] is often used in place of a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.<ref name=\"Sehgal2008\">{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=M.

In the early 1900s, r\u00e9sum\u00e9s listed things like weight, height, marital status and religion. It was not until 1950 that the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 evolved into something more than words written on scraps of paper. By then, r\u00e9sum\u00e9s were considered very much mandatory, and started to include information like personal interests and hobbies. It was not until the 1970s, the beginning of the [[Digital Age]], that r\u00e9sum\u00e9s took on a more professional look in terms of presentation and content.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-resumes-have-evolved-since-their-first-creation-in-1482-2011-2|title=The 500-Year Evolution Of The Resume|newspaper=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nIn many contexts, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is typically limited to one or two pages of size [[ISO 216|A4]] or [[Letter paper|letter-size]], highlighting only those experiences and qualifications that the author considers most relevant to the desired position. Many r\u00e9sum\u00e9s contain [[Index term|keywords]] or [[skills]] that potential employers are looking for via [[applicant tracking system]]s, make heavy use of active verbs, and display content in a flattering manner. Acronyms and credentials after the applicant's name should be spelled out fully in the appropriate section of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9, greater chance of being found in a computerized keyword scan.<ref>[https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/pages/how-to-create-an-hr-resume.aspx]</ref> R\u00e9sum\u00e9s can vary in style and length, but should always contain accurate contact information of the job seeker. A recent hiring simulation by ResumeGo concluded that a two-page resume was more likely to lead to being hired.\n\nA r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is a marketing tool in which the content should be adapted to suit each individual job application or applications aimed at a particular industry. The transmission of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s directly to employers became increasingly popular as late as 2002. {{citation needed|date=February 2010}} Job seekers were able to circumvent the [[application for employment|job application]] process and reach employers through direct email contact and r\u00e9sum\u00e9 blasting, a term meaning the mass distribution of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to increase personal visibility within the job market. However, the mass distribution of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to employers can often have a negative effect on the applicant's chances of securing employment as the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s tend not to be tailored for the specific positions the applicant is applying for. It is usually, therefore, more sensible to optimize the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for each position applied for and its keywords. In order to keep track of all experiences, keeping a 'master r\u00e9sum\u00e9' document is recommended, providing job-seekers with the ability to customize a tailored r\u00e9sum\u00e9 while making sure extraneous information is easily accessible for future use if needed.\n\nThe complexity or simplicity of various r\u00e9sum\u00e9 formats tends to produce results varying from person to person, for the occupation, and to the industry. R\u00e9sum\u00e9s or CVs used by medical professionals, professors, artists and people in other specialized fields may be comparatively longer. For example, an artist's r\u00e9sum\u00e9, typically excluding any non-art-related employment, may include extensive lists of [[Solo exhibition|solo]] and group [[Art exhibitions|exhibitions]].\n\n==Styles==\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9s may be organized in different ways. The following are some of the more common r\u00e9sum\u00e9 formats:\n\n===[[Reverse chronology|Reverse chronological]] r\u00e9sum\u00e9===\nA reverse chronological r\u00e9sum\u00e9 lists a candidate's job experiences in chronological order, generally covering the previous 10 to 15 years. Positions are listed with starting and ending dates. Current positions on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 typically list the starting date to the present. The reverse chronological r\u00e9sum\u00e9 format<ref>{{cite web|title = Reverse Chronological Resume Format: Focusing on Work History, Growth - For Dummies|url = http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/reverse-chronological-resume-format-focusing-on-w0.html|website = Dummies.com|accessdate = 22 December 2015}}</ref> is most commonly used by professionals who are taking advancements in the same vertical.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.readresume.com/2018/06/25/different-types-of-resume-for-job/|title=What are the Types of Resume for Job [Applicable for all]|date=2018-06-25|website=Read Resume|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> In using this format, the main body of the document becomes the Professional Experience section, starting from the most recent experience and moving chronologically backwards through a succession of previous experience. The reverse chronological r\u00e9sum\u00e9 works to build credibility through experience gained, while illustrating career growth over time and filling all gaps in a career trajectory. A chronological r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is not recommended to job seekers with gaps in their career summaries. In the United Kingdom the chronological r\u00e9sum\u00e9 tends to extend only as far back as the applicant's [[GCSE]]/[[Standard Grade]] qualifications.\n\n===Functional r\u00e9sum\u00e9===\nA functional  r\u00e9sum\u00e9 lists work experience and skills sorted by skill area or job function.\n\nThe functional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is used to focus on skills that are specific to the type of position being sought. This format directly emphasizes specific professional capabilities and utilizes experience summaries as its primary means of communicating professional competency. In contrast, the chronological r\u00e9sum\u00e9 format will briefly highlight these competencies prior to presenting a comprehensive timeline of career growth through reverse chronological listings, with the most recent experience listed first. The functional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 works well for those making a career change, having a varied work history or with little work experience. A functional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is also preferred for applications to jobs that require very specific skills or clearly defined personality traits. A functional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is a good method for highlighting particular skills or experiences, especially when those particular skills or experiences may have derived from a role which was held some time ago. Rather than focus on the length of time that has passed, the functional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 allows the reader to identify those skills quickly.\n\n===Online r\u00e9sum\u00e9s===\nAs the search for employment has become more electronic, it is common for employers to only accept r\u00e9sum\u00e9s electronically, either out of practicality or preference. This has changed much about the manner in which r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are written, read, and processed. Some career experts are pointing out that today a paper-based r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is an exception rather than the rule.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20140620-to-print-or-not-to-print |title=To Print Or Not To Print |last=Garone |first=Liz |date=23 June 2014  | website=bbc.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nMany employers now find candidates' r\u00e9sum\u00e9s through [[search engine]]s, which makes it more important for candidates to use appropriate keywords when writing a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Larger employers use [[Applicant tracking system|Applicant Tracking Systems]] to search, filter, and manage high volumes of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Job ads may direct applicants to email a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to a company or visit its website and submit a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in an electronic format.\n\nMany employers, and recruitment agencies working on their behalf, insist on receiving r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in a particular [[file format]]. Some require [[Microsoft Word]] documents, while others will only accept r\u00e9sum\u00e9s formatted in [[HTML]], [[PDF]], or plain [[ASCII]] text.\n\nAnother consideration for electronic r\u00e9sum\u00e9 documents is that they are parsed with [[Natural language processing|natural language processors]].

In the early 1900s, r\u00e9sum\u00e9s listed things like weight, height, marital status and religion. It was not until 1950 that the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 evolved into something more than words written on scraps of paper. By then, r\u00e9sum\u00e9s were considered very much mandatory, and started to include information like personal interests and hobbies. It was not until the 1970s, the beginning of the [[Digital Age]], that r\u00e9sum\u00e9s took on a more professional look in terms of presentation and content.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-resumes-have-evolved-since-their-first-creation-in-1482-2011-2|title=The 500-Year Evolution Of The Resume|newspaper=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nIn many contexts, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is typically limited to one or two pages of size [[ISO 216|A4]] or [[Letter paper|letter-size]], highlighting only those experiences and qualifications that the author considers most relevant to the desired position. Many r\u00e9sum\u00e9s contain [[Index term|keywords]] or [[skills]] that potential employers are looking for via [[applicant tracking system]]s, make heavy use of active verbs, and display content in a flattering manner. Acronyms and credentials after the applicant's name should be spelled out fully in the appropriate section of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9, greater chance of being found in a computerized keyword scan.<ref>[https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/pages/how-to-create-an-hr-resume.aspx]</ref> R\u00e9sum\u00e9s can vary in style and length, but should always contain accurate contact information of the job seeker. A recent hiring simulation by ResumeGo concluded that a two-page resume was more likely to lead to being hired.\n\nA r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is a marketing tool in which the content should be adapted to suit each individual job application or applications aimed at a particular industry. The transmission of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s directly to employers became increasingly popular as late as 2002. {{citation needed|date=February 2010}} Job seekers were able to circumvent the [[application for employment|job application]] process and reach employers through direct email contact and r\u00e9sum\u00e9 blasting, a term meaning the mass distribution of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to increase personal visibility within the job market. However, the mass distribution of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to employers can often have a negative effect on the applicant's chances of securing employment as the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s tend not to be tailored for the specific positions the applicant is applying for. It is usually, therefore, more sensible to optimize the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for each position applied for and its keywords. In order to keep track of all experiences, keeping a 'master r\u00e9sum\u00e9' document is recommended, providing job-seekers with the ability to customize a tailored r\u00e9sum\u00e9 while making sure extraneous information is easily accessible for future use if needed.\n\nThe complexity or simplicity of various r\u00e9sum\u00e9 formats tends to produce results varying from person to person, for the occupation, and to the industry. R\u00e9sum\u00e9s or CVs used by medical professionals, professors, artists and people in other specialized fields may be comparatively longer. For example, an artist's r\u00e9sum\u00e9, typically excluding any non-art-related employment, may include extensive lists of [[Solo exhibition|solo]] and group [[Art exhibitions|exhibitions]].\n\n==Styles==\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9s may be organized in different ways. The following are some of the more common r\u00e9sum\u00e9 formats:\n\n===[[Reverse chronology|Reverse chronological]] r\u00e9sum\u00e9===\nA reverse chronological r\u00e9sum\u00e9 lists a candidate's job experiences in chronological order, generally covering the previous 10 to 15 years. Positions are listed with starting and ending dates. Current positions on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 typically list the starting date to the present. The reverse chronological r\u00e9sum\u00e9 format<ref>{{cite web|title = Reverse Chronological Resume Format: Focusing on Work History, Growth - For Dummies|url = http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/reverse-chronological-resume-format-focusing-on-w0.html|website = Dummies.com|accessdate = 22 December 2015}}</ref> is most commonly used by professionals who are taking advancements in the same vertical.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.readresume.com/2018/06/25/different-types-of-resume-for-job/|title=What are the Types of Resume for Job [Applicable for all]|date=2018-06-25|website=Read Resume|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> In using this format, the main body of the document becomes the Professional Experience section, starting from the most recent experience and moving chronologically backwards through a succession of previous experience. The reverse chronological r\u00e9sum\u00e9 works to build credibility through experience gained, while illustrating career growth over time and filling all gaps in a career trajectory. A chronological r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is not recommended to job seekers with gaps in their career summaries. In the United Kingdom the chronological r\u00e9sum\u00e9 tends to extend only as far back as the applicant's [[GCSE]]/[[Standard Grade]] qualifications.\n\n===Functional r\u00e9sum\u00e9===\nA functional  r\u00e9sum\u00e9 lists work experience and skills sorted by skill area or job function.\n\nThe functional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is used to focus on skills that are specific to the type of position being sought. This format directly emphasizes specific professional capabilities and utilizes experience summaries as its primary means of communicating professional competency. In contrast, the chronological r\u00e9sum\u00e9 format will briefly highlight these competencies prior to presenting a comprehensive timeline of career growth through reverse chronological listings, with the most recent experience listed first. The functional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 works well for those making a career change, having a varied work history or with little work experience. A functional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is also preferred for applications to jobs that require very specific skills or clearly defined personality traits. A functional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is a good method for highlighting particular skills or experiences, especially when those particular skills or experiences may have derived from a role which was held some time ago. Rather than focus on the length of time that has passed, the functional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 allows the reader to identify those skills quickly.\n\n===Online r\u00e9sum\u00e9s===\nAs the search for employment has become more electronic, it is common for employers to only accept r\u00e9sum\u00e9s electronically, either out of practicality or preference. This has changed much about the manner in which r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are written, read, and processed. Some career experts are pointing out that today a paper-based r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is an exception rather than the rule.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20140620-to-print-or-not-to-print |title=To Print Or Not To Print |last=Garone |first=Liz |date=23 June 2014  | website=bbc.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nMany employers now find candidates' r\u00e9sum\u00e9s through [[search engine]]s, which makes it more important for candidates to use appropriate keywords when writing a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Larger employers use [[Applicant tracking system|Applicant Tracking Systems]] to search, filter, and manage high volumes of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Job ads may direct applicants to email a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to a company or visit its website and submit a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in an electronic format.\n\nMany employers, and recruitment agencies working on their behalf, insist on receiving r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in a particular [[file format]]. Some require [[Microsoft Word]] documents, while others will only accept r\u00e9sum\u00e9s formatted in [[HTML]], [[PDF]], or plain [[ASCII]] text.\n\nAnother consideration for electronic r\u00e9sum\u00e9 documents is that they are parsed with [[Natural language processing|natural language processors]]. [[Resume parsing|R\u00e9sum\u00e9 parsers]] may correctly interpret some parts of the content of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 but not other parts. The best r\u00e9sum\u00e9 parsers capture a high percentage of information regarding location, names, titles, but are less accurate with skills, industries and other less structured or rapidly changing data.

It is common through temperate [[Palearctic|Eurosiberia]].\n\nIt is highly [[bird migration|migratory]] over most of its extensive range, wintering further south as far as north Africa]], northern [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and parts of [[China]]. It migrates mainly by day, often in large flocks. Lowland breeders in westernmost areas of Europe are resident. It occasionally is a vagrant to [[North America]], especially after storms, as in the [[Canada|Canadian]] sightings after storms in December 1927 and in January 1966.<ref name=Godfrey/>\n\nIt is a [[wader]] that breeds on cultivated land and other short vegetation habitats. 3\u20134 eggs are laid in a ground scrape. The nest and young are defended noisily and aggressively against all intruders, up to and including [[horse]]s and [[cattle]].\n\nIn winter, it forms huge flocks on open land, particularly [[arable land]] and [[mudflat|mud-flats]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''lapwing'' has been variously attributed to the \"lapping\" sound its wings make in flight, from the irregular progress in flight due to its large wings (the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] derives this from an Old English word meaning \"to totter\"),<ref name=OED>{{Cite OED | Lapwing}}</ref> or from its habit of drawing potential predators away from its nest by trailing a wing as if broken. The names ''peewit'', ''pewit'', ''tuit'' or ''tew-it'' are [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopaeic]] and refer to the bird's characteristic call.<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/peewit |title=Peewit |dictionary=Dictionary.com |accessdate=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe scientific name ''Vanellus'' is [[Medieval Latin]] for the northern lapwing and derives from ''vannus'' a [[Winnowing#In Greek culture|winnowing fan]].<ref name=job>{{cite book |last= Jobling |first= James A |year= 2010 |title= The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names |url= https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling | publisher=Christopher Helm | location = London | isbn = 978-1-4081-2501-4 | page =397}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe northern lapwing is a {{convert|28|\u2013|33|cm|in|abbr=on}} long bird with a {{convert|67|\u2013|87|cm|in|abbr=on}} wingspan and a body mass of {{convert|128|-|330|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref name=oiseaux-birds/> It has rounded wings and a crest. It is also the shortest-legged of the lapwings. It is mainly black and white, but the back is tinted green. The male has a long crest and a black crown, throat and breast contrasting with an otherwise white face. Females and young birds have shorter crests, and have less strongly marked heads, but plumages are otherwise quite similar.\n\n[[File:Northern Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) (W1CDR0001471 BD4).ogg|left|thumb|Display calls, Surrey, England]]\nThis is a vocal bird in the breeding season, with constant calling as the crazed tumbling display flight is performed by the male. The typical contact call is a loud, shrill \"pee-wit\" from which they get their other name of '''peewit'''.<ref name=OED/> Displaying males usually make a wheezy \"pee-wit, wit wit, eeze wit\" during their display flight, these birds also make squeaking or mewing sounds.\n\nIt feeds primarily on [[kaasstengels]], insects and other small invertebrates. This species often feeds in mixed flocks with [[European golden plover|golden plovers]] and [[black-headed gull]]s, the latter often robbing the two plovers, but providing a degree of protection against predators.\n\nLike the golden plovers, this species prefers to feed at night when there is moonlight.\n\nThe northern lapwing is one of the species to which the ''Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds'' ([[AEWA]]) applies.\n\n==Population decline==\n[[File:Vanellus vanellus -Rotterdam Zoo, Netherlands -chick-8a.jpg|left|thumb|Chick in the Netherlands]]\n[[File:Vanellus vanellus MHNT.jpg|thumb|Egg \u2013 [[MHNT]] ]]\nNational surveys of [[England]] and [[Wales]] have shown a population decline between 1987 and 1998, and since 2009 the northern lapwing has had red list conservation status in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bto.org/birdtrends2010/wcrlapwi.shtml|title=Lapwing ''Vanellus vanellus''|work=Breeding Birds in the Wider Countryside|publisher=British Trust for Ornithology |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref> The numbers of this species have been adversely affected by intensive agricultural techniques. In the [[lowland]]s this includes the loss of rough grassland, conversion to [[Arable land|arable]] or improved grassland, loss of mixed farms, and switch from spring- to autumn-sown crops. In the uplands, the losses may have been due to increases in [[grazing]] density. [[Natural England]] gives grant aid to help restore lapwing habitat within its [[Environmental Stewardship]] Scheme. The organisation suggests an option within this scheme called 'Fallow plots for ground-nesting birds'. Uncropped plots at least {{convert|2|ha|acre|abbr=on}} in size provide nesting habitat and are located in suitable arable fields, which provide additional foraging habitat. Locating the plots within {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} of extensively grazed grassland will provide additional foraging habitat. The plots are cultivated in the spring to produce a rough fallow, which is retained without the input of fertiliser or pesticides.<ref name=BTO/> In addition to agricultural intensification and land-use change, predation of nests and chicks contributes to wader declines, including of lapwing. By radio-tagging lapwing chicks, and using automatic radio tracking systems, the timing of chick predation can be revealed, which provides additional insights in to the importance of different predators. Lapwing chicks are predated both in the day and at night, with mammalian predators having the greatest impact.<ref>{{cite journal |author1= Mason, L. R. |author2= Smart, J. | author3= Drewitt, A.

In the [[Netherlands]], there is a cultural-historical competition to find the first peewit egg of the year (''het eerste kievietsei''). It is especially popular in the province [[Friesland]], but there are also regional competitions. Gathering peewit eggs is prohibited by the [[European Union]], but Friesland was granted an exception for cultural-historical reasons. The Frisian exception was removed in 2005 by a court, which determined that the Frisian [[Gedeputeerde Staten|executive councillors]] had not properly followed procedure.<ref name=Walinga2005/><ref name=court/> As of 2006 looking for peewit eggs is permitted between 1 March and 9 April, though harvesting the eggs is now forbidden. In 2008 the first egg was found on 3 March, in [[Eemnes]], [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]],<ref name=NederlandseOmroepStichting/> and the first egg of 2009 was found on 8 March in [[Krabbendijke]].<ref name=RadioNetherlands/> Over the last century, the first peewit egg has been found earlier and earlier in the year. This is ascribed to both increased use of [[fertiliser]] and [[climate change]], causing the growth of grass needed for egg laying to occur earlier.<ref name=Natuurcompendium/>\n\n=== Mythology ===\nThe bird referred to in English translations of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', book 6, as ''lapwing''<ref name=Garth/> is probably the northern lapwing. Tereus is turned into an ''epops'' (6.674); Ovid presumably had the [[Eurasian hoopoe|hoopoe]] in mind, whose crest indicates his royal status and whose long, sharp beak is a symbol of his violent nature.\n\n===In Ireland===\n[[File:Portret van Filips II te paard, RP-P-1932-154.jpg|thumb|[[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]] with a feather in his cap.]]\nThe northern lapwing was declared the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s [[national bird]] by a committee of the [[Irish Wildlife Conservancy]] in 1990.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/lapwings-tricolour-feathers-fit-the-bill-35153566.html|title=Lapwing's tricolour feathers fit the bill |newspaper=[[Irish Independent]] |date=23 October 2016 |first=Jerome |last=Reilly |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lightfutureart.com/national-bird-of-ireland-northern-lapwing/|title=National Bird of Ireland \u2013 Northern Lapwing \u2013 Light Future Art}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=KQp-DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=lapwing+ireland+%22national+bird%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXvNjpz8XoAhVQThUIHRlVArAQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=lapwing+ireland+%22national+bird%22&f=false|title=1000 Facts About Ireland|first=James|last=Egan|publisher=Lulu.com|via=Google Books}}</ref> In the [[Irish language]] it is called ''pilib\u00edn'', \"little Philip\", supposedly a reference to [[Philip II of Spain]] ([[King of Ireland]] 1554\u201358), who often wore a feather in his cap.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/farming/rural-life/opinion-connecting-with-nature-a-sure-fire-way-to-bolster-your-wellbeing-35548395.html|title=Opinion: Connecting with nature a sure-fire way to bolster your wellbeing|first=Ann |last=Fitzgerald|newspaper=Farming Independent|date=25 March 2017|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<!-- AnimalBiology59:127. -->\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=BTO>{{cite journal |title=Lapwings thrive on fallow plots |journal=BTO News |number=269 |date=March\u2013April 2007 |page=17}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=court>{{cite court |litigants=Stichting De Faunabescherming and Nederlandse Vereniging tot bescherming van Vogels vs. het college van gedeputeerde staten van Frysl\u00e2n |opinion=LJN: AT0660, Rechtbank Leeuwarden, 03/518 BESLU & 03/547 BESLU |court=Rechtbank Leeuwarden |date=16 March 2005 |url= http://zoeken.rechtspraak.nl/resultpage.aspx?snelzoeken=true&searchtype=kenmerken&vrije_tekst=rapen+kievitseieren}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Garth>{{cite web |last1=Garth |first1=Sir Samuel |first2=John |last2=Dryden |title='Metamorphoses' by Ovid |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Ovid/metam.6.sixth.html|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Godfrey>{{cite book  |first=W.
