The dam's main purpose would be to supplement storage capacity in the upper San Joaquin River basin. Under the current proposal, Temperance Flat would slightly more than double water storage on the San Joaquin River from below [[Friant Dam]]. The project is highly controversial because it would flood scenic canyons and historic sites along the San Joaquin River, and impact upstream [[hydroelectricity]] generation.

A dam at any of these sites would be either of rockfill, concrete gravity or concrete arch design, ranging in height from {{convert|415|to|840|ft|m|abbr=on}}, with their reservoirs ranging in size from {{convert|460000|to|2775000|acre feet|km3|abbr=on}}. However, since the RM 274 and RM 279 sites are located in the upper reaches of [[Millerton Lake]], the reservoir of Friant Dam, some of the water in their reservoirs would replace the existing storage in Millerton instead of adding new capacity. In addition, most of the previously proposed reservoir heights would flood the upstream Kerckhoff Lake.<ref name=\"summary\">{{cite web |url=http://www.usbr.gov/mp/sccao/storage/docs/phase1_rpt_fnl/tech_app/11_temperance_flat.pdf |title=Temperance Flat Reservoir: Surface Storage Option Technical Appendix to the Phase 1 Investigation Report |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Reclamation |work=Upper San Joaquin River Basin Storage Investigation |date=October 2003 |accessdate=2012-03-10}}</ref>\n\nAs of January 2014, the Bureau of Reclamation has limited the proposed dam to RM 274, with four alternatives on the specifics of the project.<ref name=\"USBR report\"/>\nThe Bureau of Reclamation estimates that the annual net benefit for California of this proposed dam will range from a cost of $22.7 million to a benefit of $41 million, with an average benefit of $14.2 million for all proposed alternative plans. Annual operations and management costs would be between $16.7 and 25.1 million. The average cost-benefit ratio for California across all the alternatives is 1.12, which is reached after spreading the costs of construction over 100 years. Without including the highly subjective ecosystem benefits, the highest cost-benefit ratio is 0.83. At the 6-county level, the ratio when including the ecosystem benefits is at most 0.87.<ref name=\"USBR report\"/> \nThe methods used to calculate environmental benefits are not readily available online.<ref>http://www.usbr.gov/mp/sccao/storage/docs/index.html</ref>\n\nAs the Temperance Flat Reservoir would inundate several existing hydroelectric powerhouses, the most recent proposal for the dam has a larger hydroelectric capacity of 160 MW.<ref name=\"USBR report\"/>\n\nTemperance Flat would allow the San Joaquin River reservoir system to capture significant amounts of winter and spring runoff that would otherwise be spilled downstream because of insufficient storage capacity. Estimates range from {{convert|165000|to|183000|acre feet|km3|abbr=on}} of water conserved each year. By increasing the surface water yield from the San Joaquin River, the dam and reservoir would help reduce the need for groundwater extraction in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] for irrigation.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation estimates that after construction of the dam the long-term average increase in spring-run chinook salmon abundance would vary from between 0.65% and 2.7% (averaged across all four alternatives, for worst case and best case smolt-to-adult return rates, respectively). 25% of the scenarios decreased long-term chinook salmon abundance.<ref name=\"USBR report\"/>\n\n==Negative effects==\nFilling Temperance Flat Reservoir above an elevation of {{convert|1100|ft|m}} would inundate several hydroelectric plants of the [[Big Creek Hydroelectric Project]] that total a capacity of 313 MW and generate 1,125 million KWh annually. Thus, the Temperance Flat Dam project would cause a net loss of hydroelectric generation, in lieu of massive reconstruction of upstream facilities. Additionally, 240 foot tall embankment cofferdams would be built on streams surrounding the area in order to divert flows. In their most recent draft the Bureau of Reclamation deleted measures to construct temperature control devices on [[Friant Dam]], which are known to improve habitat quality for salmon. They additionally deleted a measure which would have increased water quality downstream of Millerton Lake. The Bureau of Reclamation notes that construction of the dam and reservoir will have \"unavoidable and/or disproportionately high and adverse\" impacts on the following: air quality, fisheries, aquatic ecosystems, botanical and wetland resources, wildlife, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, cultural resources, agricultural resources, noise and vibration, and visual resources.<ref name=\"USBR report\"/><ref name=\"summary\"/>\n\nAs the Temperance Flat Dam would flood both historic Kerckhoff powerhouses, the hydroelectric generating capacity of Kerckhoff Reservoir would be entirely removed. The proposed Temperance flat power system would only be able to replace between 81% and 91% of that power.<ref name=\"USBR report\"/> An additional 15.7\u201315.8 GWh of power could be generated by maximizing output at Friant Dam,<ref name=\"USBR report\"/> but this still results in a net loss of hydroelectric power generation, or only a very slight increase, depending on the alternative specified. A dam of similar size, [[New Bullards Bar Dam]], has an annual power generation of nearly 16 times that of the proposed Temperance Flat Dam, even discounting the reduction in power generation from the loss of the Kerckhoff powerhouses.<ref>http://www.ycwa-relicensing.com/Project%20Maps%20Schematics%20and%20Fact%20Sheets/YCWA%20Relicensing%20Fact%20Sheet%20and%20Flow%20Schematic.pdf</ref>\n\nSome environmental groups such as Friends of the River have questioned the effectiveness of the Temperance Flat project on increasing surface water supplies in California, calling it \"an expensive and ineffective solution to the state's water needs\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.friendsoftheriver.org/site/PageServer?pagename=FORCalRiversSanJoaquin |title=California Rivers: San Joaquin River |publisher=Friends of the River |accessdate=2012-03-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924015625/http://www.friendsoftheriver.org/site/PageServer?pagename=FORCalRiversSanJoaquin |archivedate=2015-09-24 }}</ref> In addition, the placement of the Temperance Flat Dam at RM 274 would reduce the capacity of Millerton Lake by 75,000 acre feet, a capacity greater than 150 of California's current reservoirs.\n\nLocal Native American tribes have identified 30 sensitive sites within the Temperance Flat study area, one of which was defined by the Native American Heritage Commission as sacred.<ref name=\"USBR report\"/>\n\nThe proposed reservoir would drown {{convert|18|mi|km}} of the San Joaquin River, which includes scenic canyons, whitewater rapids and historic and cultural sites, as well as reducing the water flow to sensitive habitat in the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bay.org/rivers-and-delta/reconnecting-rivers-to-the-bay/san-joaquin-river/temperance-flat |title=Temperance Flat |publisher=The Bay Institute |accessdate=2012-03-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319100511/http://www.bay.org/rivers-and-delta/reconnecting-rivers-to-the-bay/san-joaquin-river/temperance-flat |archivedate=2011-03-19 }}</ref> Reduction of spring flood flows, via capture by Temperance Flat dam, could reduce rearing habitat for spawning salmonids downstream.

The dam's main purpose would be to supplement storage capacity in the upper San Joaquin River basin. Under the current proposal, Temperance Flat would slightly more than double water storage on the San Joaquin River from below [[Friant Dam]]. The project is highly controversial because it would flood scenic canyons and historic sites along the San Joaquin River, and impact upstream [[hydroelectricity]] generation. The Bureau of Reclamation estimates the construction costs will be between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion,<ref name=\"USBR report\">{{cite news |author=Bureau of Reclamation |url=http://www.usbr.gov/mp/sccao/storage/docs/Draft_Feasibility_Report_2014/USJRBSI_Draft_FR_2014_Full_Report.pdf |title=Draft Upper San Joaquin River Basin Storage Investigation Feasibility Report |work=Bureau of Reclamation Mid-Pacific Region |year=2014 |accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref> while other estimates range from US$2.96 billion up to US$3.35 billion.<ref name=\"valleyvoice\">{{cite news|author=Lindt, John |url=http://www.valleyvoicenewspaper.com/vv/stories/2009/vv_temperanceflat_0164.htm |title=Temperance Flat Cost Pegged at $3.3 Billion |work=Valley Voice Newspaper |year=2009 |accessdate=2012-03-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316022146/http://www.valleyvoicenewspaper.com/vv/stories/2009/vv_temperanceflat_0164.htm |archivedate=March 16, 2012 }}</ref> At 665 feet, Temperance Flat Dam would be the second highest dam in California, and the fifth tallest dam in the United States.<ref>http://www.water.ca.gov/swp/facilities/Oroville/LakeDam.cfm</ref>\n\nOn February 28, 2014, Representative [[Jim Costa]] (D-CA) introduced H.R. 4127, to authorize construction of the Temperance Flat Dam.<ref>http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4127</ref> The Bureau of Reclamation released a draft [[environmental impact statement]] for the project in September 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usbr.gov/mp/nepa/nepa_projdetails.cfm?Project_ID=821 |title=Upper San Joaquin River Basin Storage Project EIS |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Reclamation |work=Upper San Joaquin River Basin Storage Investigation |date=September 2014 |accessdate=2014-10-08}}</ref> The dam is one of three major storage projects that could be funded by a $7.5 billion water bond open for voting in November 2014.<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Temperance Flat Reservoir: It's getting serious\n|work=The Fresno Bee\n|author=Grossi, Mark\n|date=2014-09-13\n|accessdate=2014-09-21\n|url=http://www.fresnobee.com/2014/09/13/4121769_temperance-flat-reservoir-its.html?rh=1}}</ref>\n\n==Specifications and benefits==\nThe [[U.S. Bureau of Reclamation]], which would be responsible for construction and operation of Temperance Flat, previously had proposed three potential dam sites along the San Joaquin River \u2013 at [[river mile]] (RM) 274 ([[river kilometer|RKM]] 441), RM 279 (449), and RM 286 (RKM 460). A dam at any of these sites would be either of rockfill, concrete gravity or concrete arch design, ranging in height from {{convert|415|to|840|ft|m|abbr=on}}, with their reservoirs ranging in size from {{convert|460000|to|2775000|acre feet|km3|abbr=on}}. However, since the RM 274 and RM 279 sites are located in the upper reaches of [[Millerton Lake]], the reservoir of Friant Dam, some of the water in their reservoirs would replace the existing storage in Millerton instead of adding new capacity. In addition, most of the previously proposed reservoir heights would flood the upstream Kerckhoff Lake.<ref name=\"summary\">{{cite web |url=http://www.usbr.gov/mp/sccao/storage/docs/phase1_rpt_fnl/tech_app/11_temperance_flat.pdf |title=Temperance Flat Reservoir: Surface Storage Option Technical Appendix to the Phase 1 Investigation Report |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Reclamation |work=Upper San Joaquin River Basin Storage Investigation |date=October 2003 |accessdate=2012-03-10}}</ref>\n\nAs of January 2014, the Bureau of Reclamation has limited the proposed dam to RM 274, with four alternatives on the specifics of the project.<ref name=\"USBR report\"/>\nThe Bureau of Reclamation estimates that the annual net benefit for California of this proposed dam will range from a cost of $22.7 million to a benefit of $41 million, with an average benefit of $14.2 million for all proposed alternative plans. Annual operations and management costs would be between $16.7 and 25.1 million. The average cost-benefit ratio for California across all the alternatives is 1.12, which is reached after spreading the costs of construction over 100 years. Without including the highly subjective ecosystem benefits, the highest cost-benefit ratio is 0.83. At the 6-county level, the ratio when including the ecosystem benefits is at most 0.87.<ref name=\"USBR report\"/> \nThe methods used to calculate environmental benefits are not readily available online.<ref>http://www.usbr.gov/mp/sccao/storage/docs/index.html</ref>\n\nAs the Temperance Flat Reservoir would inundate several existing hydroelectric powerhouses, the most recent proposal for the dam has a larger hydroelectric capacity of 160 MW.<ref name=\"USBR report\"/>\n\nTemperance Flat would allow the San Joaquin River reservoir system to capture significant amounts of winter and spring runoff that would otherwise be spilled downstream because of insufficient storage capacity. Estimates range from {{convert|165000|to|183000|acre feet|km3|abbr=on}} of water conserved each year. By increasing the surface water yield from the San Joaquin River, the dam and reservoir would help reduce the need for groundwater extraction in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] for irrigation.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation estimates that after construction of the dam the long-term average increase in spring-run chinook salmon abundance would vary from between 0.65% and 2.7% (averaged across all four alternatives, for worst case and best case smolt-to-adult return rates, respectively). 25% of the scenarios decreased long-term chinook salmon abundance.<ref name=\"USBR report\"/>\n\n==Negative effects==\nFilling Temperance Flat Reservoir above an elevation of {{convert|1100|ft|m}} would inundate several hydroelectric plants of the [[Big Creek Hydroelectric Project]] that total a capacity of 313 MW and generate 1,125 million KWh annually. Thus, the Temperance Flat Dam project would cause a net loss of hydroelectric generation, in lieu of massive reconstruction of upstream facilities. Additionally, 240 foot tall embankment cofferdams would be built on streams surrounding the area in order to divert flows. In their most recent draft the Bureau of Reclamation deleted measures to construct temperature control devices on [[Friant Dam]], which are known to improve habitat quality for salmon. They additionally deleted a measure which would have increased water quality downstream of Millerton Lake. The Bureau of Reclamation notes that construction of the dam and reservoir will have \"unavoidable and/or disproportionately high and adverse\" impacts on the following: air quality, fisheries, aquatic ecosystems, botanical and wetland resources, wildlife, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, cultural resources, agricultural resources, noise and vibration, and visual resources.<ref name=\"USBR report\"/><ref name=\"summary\"/>\n\nAs the Temperance Flat Dam would flood both historic Kerckhoff powerhouses, the hydroelectric generating capacity of Kerckhoff Reservoir would be entirely removed. The proposed Temperance flat power system would only be able to replace between 81% and 91% of that power.<ref name=\"USBR report\"/> An additional 15.7\u201315.8 GWh of power could be generated by maximizing output at Friant Dam,<ref name=\"USBR report\"/> but this still results in a net loss of hydroelectric power generation, or only a very slight increase, depending on the alternative specified. A dam of similar size, [[New Bullards Bar Dam]], has an annual power generation of nearly 16 times that of the proposed Temperance Flat Dam, even discounting the reduction in power generation from the loss of the Kerckhoff powerhouses.<ref>http://www.ycwa-relicensing.com/Project%20Maps%20Schematics%20and%20Fact%20Sheets/YCWA%20Relicensing%20Fact%20Sheet%20and%20Flow%20Schematic.pdf</ref>\n\nSome environmental groups such as Friends of the River have questioned the effectiveness of the Temperance Flat project on increasing surface water supplies in California, calling it \"an expensive and ineffective solution to the state's water needs\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.friendsoftheriver.org/site/PageServer?pagename=FORCalRiversSanJoaquin |title=California Rivers: San Joaquin River |publisher=Friends of the River |accessdate=2012-03-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924015625/http://www.friendsoftheriver.org/site/PageServer?pagename=FORCalRiversSanJoaquin |archivedate=2015-09-24 }}</ref> In addition, the placement of the Temperance Flat Dam at RM 274 would reduce the capacity of Millerton Lake by 75,000 acre feet, a capacity greater than 150 of California's current reservoirs.\n\nLocal Native American tribes have identified 30 sensitive sites within the Temperance Flat study area, one of which was defined by the Native American Heritage Commission as sacred.<ref name=\"USBR report\"/>\n\nThe proposed reservoir would drown {{convert|18|mi|km}} of the San Joaquin River, which includes scenic canyons, whitewater rapids and historic and cultural sites, as well as reducing the water flow to sensitive habitat in the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bay.org/rivers-and-delta/reconnecting-rivers-to-the-bay/san-joaquin-river/temperance-flat |title=Temperance Flat |publisher=The Bay Institute |accessdate=2012-03-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319100511/http://www.bay.org/rivers-and-delta/reconnecting-rivers-to-the-bay/san-joaquin-river/temperance-flat |archivedate=2011-03-19 }}</ref> Reduction of spring flood flows, via capture by Temperance Flat dam, could reduce rearing habitat for spawning salmonids downstream.

It is located at 1600 [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and has been the residence of every U.S. president since [[John Adams]] in 1800. The term \"White House\" is often used as a [[metonym]] for the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|president and his advisers]].\n\nThe residence was designed by Irish-born architect [[James Hoban]]{{r|TSGjH}} in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. Hoban modelled the building on [[Leinster House]] in [[Dublin]], a building which today houses the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish legislature. Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using [[Aquia Creek sandstone]] painted white. When [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]]) added low [[colonnade]]s on each wing that concealed stables and storage.{{r|bwDpG}}  In 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the mansion was set ablaze by the [[British Army]] in the [[Burning of Washington]], destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President [[James Monroe]] moved into the partially reconstructed [[Executive Residence]] in October 1817. Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829.\n\nBecause of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed [[West Wing]] in 1901. Eight years later in 1909, President [[William Howard Taft]] expanded the West Wing and created the first [[Oval Office]], which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor [[attic]] was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing [[hip roof]] with long shed dormers. A newly constructed [[East Wing]] was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the residence's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under [[Harry S. Truman]], the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing [[steel frame]] constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.\n\nThe modern-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building]]\u2014the former State Department, which now houses offices for the president's staff and the vice president\u2014and [[Blair House]], a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six stories\u2014the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story [[White House basement|basement]]. The property is a [[National Heritage Site (United States)|National Heritage Site]] owned by the [[National Park Service]] and is part of the [[President's Park]]. In 2007, it was ranked second{{r|1AvjX}} on the [[American Institute of Architects]] list of \"[[America's Favorite Architecture]]\".\n\n==Early history==\n\n===1789\u20131800===\n{{further|Presidency of George Washington#Residences}}\nFollowing his April 1789 inauguration, President [[George Washington]] occupied two private houses in New York City as the executive mansion. He lived at the first, known as the [[Samuel Osgood House|Franklin House]] and owned by Treasury Commissioner [[Samuel Osgood]], at 3 Cherry Street through late February 1790.{{r|Baker1897}}{{r|mvorg}}  The executive mansion moved to the larger quarters of the [[Alexander Macomb House]] at 39\u201341 Broadway{{r|mvorg}} where he stayed, with his wife and a small staff until August 1790. In May 1790, New York began construction of a \"proper\" house for the presidential mansion, [[Government House (New York City)|Government House]].{{r|Stokes}} Washington never used the mansion because it was not completed until after the national capital was moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in December 1790.{{r|Stokes}}\n\nThe July 1790 [[Residence Act]] designated the capital be permanently located in the new [[Washington, D.C.|Federal District]], and temporarily in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] for ten years while the permanent capital was built.{{r|6ylva}} Philadelphia rented the mansion of the wealthy merchant [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] at 190 High Street (now 524\u201330 Market Street) as the [[President's House (Philadelphia)|President's House]], which Washington occupied from November 1790 to March 1797.{{r|ushist}}  Since the house was too small to accommodate the thirty people that made up the presidential family, staff, and servants, Washington had it enlarged.{{r|ushist}} \n\nPresident [[John Adams]] also occupied the High Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On Saturday, November 1, 1800, he became the first president to occupy the White House.{{r|jK8YA}}\n\nThe President's House in Philadelphia was converted into the Union Hotel, and later used for stores before being demolished in 1832.{{r|ushist}}\n\nPhiladelphia began construction of a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away in 1792. It was nearly completed by the time of Adam's 1797 inauguration. However, Adams declined to occupy it saying he did not have Congressional authorization to lease the building. It remained vacant until it was sold to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1800.{{r|Westcott1894}}\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=100px>\nFile:The First Presidential Mansion.jpg|First Presidential Mansion: [[Samuel Osgood House]], Manhattan, New York.

However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the U.S., [[Jean Jules Jusserand]], popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, \"Pierre Charles L'Enfant\". (Reference: Bowling, Kenneth R (2002). ''Peter Charles L'Enfant: vision, honor, and male friendship in the early American Republic.'' George Washington University, Washington, D.C. {{ISBN|978-0-9727611-0-9}}). The [[United States Code]] states in {{USC|40|3309}}: \"(a) In General.\u2014The purposes of this chapter shall be carried out in the District of Columbia as nearly as may be practicable in harmony with the plan of Peter Charles L'Enfant.\" The [[National Park Service]] identifies L'Enfant as \"[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/text.htm#washington Major Peter Charles L'Enfant]\" and as \"[https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/presidents/washington_monument.html Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]\" on its website.}} 1791 [[L'Enfant Plan|plan]] for the newly established federal city, Washington, D.C.{{r|IYuWd}} Washington and his Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]], who both had personal interests in architecture, agreed that the design of the White House, and the Capital, would be chosen in a [[Architectural design competition|design competition]].{{r|Frary}}\n\nAlthough all proposals for the Capital were rejected, an acceptable drawing for the White House submitted by [[James Hoban]] was selected from several including one submitted anonymously by Jefferson himself.{{r|np7Jl}}\n\nHoban was born in Ireland and trained at the [[Dublin Society of Arts]]. He emigrated to the US after the revolution, first seeking work in Philadelphia and later finding success in [[South Carolina]] where he designed several buildings including the state capitol at [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]. Hoban ultimately supervised the construction of both the US Capitol and the White House.{{r|u1v6F}}\n\nPresident Washington visited [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in May 1791 on his \"Southern Tour\", and saw the under-construction [[Charleston County Courthouse]] designed by Hoban. He is reputed to have met with Hoban then. The following year, he summoned the architect to Philadelphia and met with him in June 1792.{{r|eYnQA}}\n\nOn July 16, 1792, the president met with the commissioners of the federal city to make his judgment in the architectural competition. His review is recorded as being brief, and he quickly selected Hoban's submission.{{r|nUHxy}}\n\n===Design influences===\nThe building has classical inspiration sources, that could be found directly or indirectly in the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] or in [[Andrea Palladio]] styles; Palladio being an Italian architect of the [[Renaissance]] which had a considerable influence on the Western architecture ([[Palladian architecture]]). The building Hoban designed is verifiably influenced by the upper floors of [[Leinster House]], in [[Dublin]], which later became the seat of the [[Oireachtas]] (the Irish parliament).{{r|Ywh2c}} Several other Georgian-era Irish country houses have been suggested as sources of inspiration for the overall floor plan, details like the bow-fronted south front, and interior details like the former niches in the present [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. These influences, though undocumented, are cited in the official White House guide, and in [[White House Historical Association]] publications. The first official White House guide, published in 1962, suggested a link between Hoban's design for the South Portico and [[Ch\u00e2teau de Rastignac]], a neoclassical country house located in [[La Bachellerie]] in the [[Dordogne]] region of France and designed by Mathurin Salat. Construction on the French house was initially started before 1789, interrupted by the [[French Revolution]] for twenty years and then finally built 1812\u20131817 (based on Salat's pre-1789 design).{{r|France?}} The theoretical link between the two houses has been criticized because Hoban did not visit France. Supporters of a connection posit that [[Thomas Jefferson]], during his tour of [[Bordeaux]] in 1789, viewed Salat's architectural drawings (which were on-file at the College) at the [[\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale d'Architecture]] (Bordeaux Architectural College).{{r|johnson}}  On his return to the U.S. he then shared the influence with Washington, Hoban, Monroe, and [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]].{{r|France?}}\n\n===Construction===\n\nConstruction of the White House began with the laying of the cornerstone on October 13, 1792, although there was no formal ceremony.{{r|yLpeA}} The main residence, as well as foundations of the house, were built largely by [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] and free [[African-American]] laborers, as well as employed Europeans.{{r|mJ52j}} Much of the other work on the house was performed by immigrants, many not yet with citizenship. The sandstone walls were erected by [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrants, employed by Hoban,{{r|whha overview}} as were the high-relief rose and garland decorations above the north entrance and the \"fish scale\" pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods. There are conflicting claims as to where the sandstone used in the construction of the White House originated. Some reports suggest sandstone from the [[Croatia]]n island of [[Bra\u010d]] (specifically the [[Pu\u010di\u0161\u0107a]] querry whose stone was used to build the ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Diocletian's Palace|palace]] of [[Diocletian|Emperor Diocletian]]) was used in the original construction of the building, contrarily researchers believe limestone from the island was used in the 1902 renovations and not the original construction. Others suggest the original sandstone simply came from [[Aquia Creek]] in [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]], [[Virginia]], as importing the stone would be too costly.{{r|zQgqd}}{{r|L0Ydi}}{{r|J1ZuL}} The initial construction took place over a period of eight years, at a reported cost of $232,371.83 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|232371.83|1800}}}} today). Although not yet completed, the White House was ready for occupancy circa November 1, 1800.{{r|XEjY4}}\n\nShortages, including material and labor, forced alterations to the earlier plan developed by French engineer [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] for a \"palace\" that was five times larger than the house that was eventually built.{{r|whha overview}} The finished structure contained only two main floors instead of the planned three, and a less costly brick served as a lining for the stone fa\u00e7ades. When construction was finished, the porous sandstone walls were [[whitewash]]ed with a mixture of lime, rice glue, casein, and lead, giving the house its familiar color and name.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nSeveral [[replicas of the White House]] have been constructed.\n\n===Architectural description===\n\nThe north front is the principal fa\u00e7ade of the White House and consists of three floors and eleven bays. The ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and [[parapet]], thus the fa\u00e7ade appears to be of two floors. The central three bays are behind a [[Prostyle|prostyle portico]] (this was a later addition to the house, built circa 1830) serving, thanks to the carriage ramp, as a [[porte cochere]]. The windows of the four bays flanking the portico, at first-floor level, have alternating pointed and segmented [[pediment]]s, while at second-floor level the pediments are flat. The principal entrance at the center of the portico is surmounted by a [[lunette]] [[fanlight]]. Above the entrance is a sculpted floral [[festoon]]. The roofline is hidden by a balustraded [[parapet]].\n\nThe mansion's southern fa\u00e7ade is a combination of the [[Palladian]] and neoclassical styles of architecture. It is of three floors, all visible. The ground floor is [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] in the Palladian fashion. At the center of the fa\u00e7ade is a neoclassical projecting bow of three bays. The bow is flanked by five bays, the windows of which, as on the north fa\u00e7ade, have alternating segmented and pointed pediments at first-floor level. The bow has a ground floor [[double staircase]] leading to an [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[colonnade]]d [[loggia]] (with the [[Truman Balcony]] at second-floor level), known as the south portico. The more modern third floor is hidden by a balustraded parapet and plays no part in the composition of the fa\u00e7ade.\n\n===Naming conventions===\n\nThe building was originally variously referred to as the \"President's Palace\", \"Presidential Mansion\", or \"President's House\".{{r|xVvhI}} The earliest evidence of the public calling it the \"White House\" was recorded in 1811.{{r|8Rmlj}} A myth emerged that during the rebuilding of the structure after the [[Burning of Washington]], white paint was applied to mask the burn damage it had suffered,{{r|A3bMb}} giving the building its namesake hue.{{r|EdqBf}} The name \"Executive Mansion\" was used in official contexts until President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established the formal name by having \"White House\u2013Washington\" engraved on the stationery in 1901.{{r|Qtiju}}{{r|WH facts}} The current letterhead wording and arrangement \"The White House\" with the word \"Washington\" centered beneath goes back to the administration of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].{{r|WH facts}}\n\nAlthough the structure was not completed until some years after the presidency of George Washington, there is speculation that the name of the traditional residence of the president of the United States may have derived from [[Martha Washington]]'s home, [[White House (plantation)|White House Plantation]] in Virginia, where the nation's first president had courted the first lady in the mid-18th century.{{r|D7o2v}}\n\n==Evolution of the White House==\n\n===Early use, the 1814 fire, and rebuilding===\n\nOn Saturday, November 1, 1800, [[John Adams]] became the first president to take residence in the building.{{r|whha overview}} The next day he wrote his wife Abigail:\n\"I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.\"{{r|whha state dining room}} \nFranklin D. Roosevelt had Adams's blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room.{{r|whha state dining room}}\n\nAdams lived in the house only briefly before [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the \"pleasant country residence\"{{r|NRJJd}} in 1801. Despite his complaints that the house was too big (\"big enough for two emperors, one pope, and the grand lama in the bargain\"{{r|sacjA}}), Jefferson considered how the White House might be added to. With [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], he helped lay out the design for the East and West Colonnades, small wings that help conceal the domestic operations of laundry, a stable and storage.{{r|whha overview}} Today, Jefferson's colonnades link the residence with the East and West Wings.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nIn 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the White House was set ablaze by British troops{{r|whha east room}} during the [[Burning of Washington]], in retaliation for burning of [[Port Dover]] and other towns in [[Upper Canada]]; much of Washington was affected by these fires as well. Only the exterior walls remained, and they had to be torn down and mostly reconstructed because of weakening from the fire and subsequent exposure to the elements, except for portions of the south wall. Of the numerous objects taken from the White House when it was ransacked by British troops, only two have been recovered. Employees and slaves rescued a painting of George Washington,{{r|whha east room}} and in 1939, a Canadian man returned a jewelry box to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], claiming that his grandfather had taken it from Washington. Some observers allege that most of these spoils were lost when a convoy of British ships led by [[HMS Fantome (1810)|HMS ''Fantome'']] sank en route to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] off [[Prospect, Nova Scotia|Prospect]] during a storm on the night of November 24, 1814,{{r|K9M68}}{{r|iDYQ3}} even though ''Fantome'' had no involvement in that action.{{r|2ZhT4}}\n\nAfter the fire, President [[James Madison]] resided in [[The Octagon House (Washington, D.C.)|the Octagon House]] from 1814 to 1815, and then the [[Seven Buildings]] from 1815 to the end of his term.{{r|KQzqy}} Meanwhile, both architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe and Hoban contributed to the design and oversight of the reconstruction, which lasted from 1815 until 1817. The south [[portico]] was constructed in 1824 during the [[James Monroe]] administration; the north portico was built six years later.{{r|whha overview}} Though Latrobe proposed similar porticos before the fire in 1814, both porticos were built as designed by Hoban.{{r|tbe3z}} An elliptical portico at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Rastignac]] in La Bachellerie, France with nearly identical curved stairs is speculated as the source of inspiration due to its similarity with the South Portico,{{r|wh museum 1825-1872}} although this matter is one of great debate.{{r|wSPdx}} Italian artisans, brought to Washington to help in constructing the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]], carved the decorative stonework on both porticos. Contrary to speculation, the North Portico was not modeled on a similar portico on another Dublin building, the [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in|Viceregal Lodge]] (now ''\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in'', residence of the [[President of Ireland]]), for its portico postdates the White House porticos' design.{{r|wh museum 1825-1872}} For the North Portico, a variation on the [[Ionic Order]] was devised incorporating a swag of roses between the volutes.

The location of the White House was questioned, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for [[malaria]] and other unhealthy conditions.{{r|epstein}} Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler was tasked to propose solutions to address these concerns. He proposed abandoning the use of the White House as a residence and designed a new estate for the first family at [[Meridian Hill Park|Meridian Hill]] in Washington, D.C., but Congress rejected the plan.{{r|epstein}} Another site under consideration was Metropolis View, today the campus of [[The Catholic University of America]].{{r|MqIIY}}\n\n[[File:WhiteHouseProposedAddition.jpg|thumb|right|Additions proposed by architect Frederick D.

Arthur]] took office in 1881, he ordered renovations to the White House to take place as soon as the recently widowed [[Lucretia Garfield]] moved out. Arthur inspected the work almost nightly and made several suggestions. [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] was asked to send selected designers to assist. Over twenty wagonloads of furniture and household items were removed from the building and sold at a [[public auction]].{{r|reeves268}} All that was saved were bust portraits of [[John Adams]] and [[Martin Van Buren]].{{r|reevesn473}} A proposal was made to build a new residence south of the White House, but it failed to gain support.\n\nIn the fall of 1882 work was done on the main corridor, including tinting the walls pale olive and adding squares of [[gold leaf]], and decorating the ceiling in gold and silver, and colorful [[Tracery|traceries]] woven to spell \"USA\". The Red Room was painted a dull Pomeranian red, and its ceiling was decorated with gold, silver, and copper stars and stripes of red, white, and blue. A fifty-foot jeweled [[Tiffany glass|Tiffany]] glass screen, supported by imitation marble columns, replaced the glass doors that separated the main corridor from the north vestibule.{{r|reeves269}}{{r|bFjvZ}}\n\nIn 1891, First Lady [[Caroline Harrison]] proposed major extensions to the White House, including a National Wing on the east for a historical art gallery, and a wing on the west for official functions.{{r|epstein}} A plan was devised by Colonel Theodore A. Bingham, which reflected the Harrison proposal.{{r|epstein}} These plans were ultimately rejected.\n\nHowever, in 1902 [[Theodore Roosevelt]] hired [[McKim, Mead & White]] to carry out expansions and renovations in a neoclassical style suited to the building's architecture, removing the Tiffany screen and all Victorian additions.{{r|Yl4bH}}{{r|R6fqD}}  [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles McKim]] himself designed and managed the project, which gave more living space to the president's large family by removing a staircase in the West Hall and moving executive office staff from the second floor of the residence into the new West Wing.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nPresident [[William Howard Taft]] enlisted the help of architect [[Nathan C.

Truman]]{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} took a great toll on the brick and sandstone structure built around a timber frame.{{r|whha overview}} By 1948, the house was declared to be in imminent danger of collapse, forcing President Truman to commission a reconstruction and to live across the street at [[Blair House]] from 1949 to 1951.{{r|OA7bu}} The work, done by the firm of [[Philadelphia]] contractor [[John McShain]], required the complete dismantling of the interior spaces, construction of a new load-bearing internal steel frame and the reconstruction of the original rooms within the new structure.{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} The total cost of the renovations was about $5.7 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5.7|1951|r=0}}}} million in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{r|vm2mG}} Some modifications to the floor plan were made, the largest being the repositioning of the grand staircase to open into the Entrance Hall, rather than the Cross Hall.{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} Central air conditioning was added, as well as two additional sub-basements providing space for workrooms, storage, and a bomb shelter.{{r|whha overview}} The Trumans moved back into the White House on March 27, 1952.{{r|whha overview}} While the house's structure was kept intact by the Truman reconstruction, much of the new interior finishes were generic, and of little historic value. Much of the original plasterwork, some dating back to the 1814\u20131816 rebuilding, was too damaged to reinstall, as was the original robust Beaux Arts paneling in the East Room. President Truman had the original timber frame sawn into paneling; the walls of the [[Vermeil Room]], [[Library (White House)|Library]], [[China Room]], and [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]] on the ground floor of the main residence were paneled in wood from the timbers.{{r|UtzOl}}\n\n===Jacqueline Kennedy restoration===\n[[File:BoudinRedRoom.jpg|thumb|The [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]] as designed by [[St\u00e9phane Boudin]] during the presidency of John F. Kennedy]]\n[[Jacqueline Kennedy]], wife of President [[John F. Kennedy]] (1961\u201363), directed a very extensive and historic redecoration of the house. She enlisted the help of [[Henry Francis du Pont]] of the [[Winterthur Museum]] to assist in collecting artifacts for the mansion, many of which had once been housed there.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} Other antiques, fine paintings, and improvements of the Kennedy period were donated to the White House by wealthy philanthropists, including the [[Crowninshield family]], [[Jane Engelhard]], [[Jayne Wrightsman]], and the Oppenheimer family.\n\n[[St\u00e9phane Boudin]] of the [[Maison Jansen|House of Jansen]], a Paris interior-design firm that had been recognized worldwide, was employed by Jacqueline Kennedy to assist with the decoration.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} Different periods of the early republic and world history were selected as a theme for each room: the Federal style for the [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]], French Empire for the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]], American Empire for the [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], Louis XVI for the [[Yellow Oval Room]], and Victorian for the president's study, renamed the [[Treaty Room]]. Antique furniture was acquired, and decorative fabric and trim based on period documents was produced and installed. The Kennedy restoration resulted in a more authentic White House of grander stature, which recalled the French taste of Madison and Monroe.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} In the [[Diplomatic Reception Room (White House)|Diplomatic Reception Room]], Mrs. Kennedy installed an antique \"Vue de l'Am\u00e9rique Nord\" wallpaper which [[Zuber & Cie]] had designed in 1834. The wallpaper had hung previously on the walls of another mansion until 1961 when that house was demolished for a grocery store. Just before the demolition, the wallpaper was salvaged and sold to the White House.\n\nThe first White House guidebook was produced under the direction of curator Lorraine Waxman Pearce with direct supervision from Mrs. Kennedy.{{r|OLizx}} Sale of the guidebook helped finance the restoration.\n\nKennedy showed her restoration of the White House to the public in [[A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F.

Furniture, fixtures, and decorative arts could now be declared either historic or of artistic interest by the president. This prevented them from being sold (as many objects in the executive mansion had been in the past 150 years). When not in use or display at the White House, these items were to be turned over to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for preservation, study, storage, or exhibition. The White House retains the right to have these items returned.{{r|AbbottRice|p=29}}\n\nOut of respect for the historic character of the White House, no substantive architectural changes have been made to the house since the Truman renovation.{{r|YsEpb}} Since the Kennedy restoration, every presidential family has made some changes to the private quarters of the White House, but the [[Committee for the Preservation of the White House]] must approve any modifications to the State Rooms. Charged with maintaining the historical integrity of the White House, the congressionally authorized committee works with each First Family\u2014usually represented by the first lady, the [[White House Office of the Curator|White House curator]], and the [[White House Chief Usher|chief usher]]\u2014to implement the family's proposals for altering the house.{{r|nJVBo}}\n\nDuring the Nixon Administration (1969\u20131974), First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] refurbished the Green Room, Blue Room, and Red Room, working with Clement Conger, the curator appointed by President [[Richard Nixon]].{{r|t2zEz}} Mrs. Nixon's efforts brought more than 600 artifacts to the house, the largest acquisition by any administration.{{r|MF74M}} Her husband created the modern press briefing room over [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s old swimming pool.{{r|press room}} Nixon also added a single-lane bowling alley to the White House basement.{{r|gMser}}\n\nComputers and the first laser printer were added during the Carter administration, and the use of computer technology was expanded during the Reagan administration.{{r|gff8t}} A Carter-era innovation, a set of [[solar heating|solar water heating panels]] that were mounted on the roof of the White House, was removed during Reagan's presidency.{{r|wq6cM}}{{r|Burdick}} Redecorations were made to the private family quarters and maintenance was made to public areas during the Reagan years.{{r|da1980}} The house was accredited as a museum in 1988.{{r|da1980}}\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] refurbished some rooms with the assistance of [[Arkansas]] decorator Kaki Hockersmith, including the Oval Office, the East Room, Blue Room, [[State Dining Room of the White House|State Dining Room]], Lincoln Bedroom, and Lincoln Sitting Room.{{r|wh makeover}} During the administration of [[George W. Bush]], First Lady [[Laura Bush]] refurbished the Lincoln Bedroom in a style contemporary with the Lincoln era; the Green Room, [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]], and theater were also refurbished.{{r|wh makeover}}\n\nThe White House became one of the first wheelchair-accessible government buildings in Washington when modifications were made during the presidency of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who used a wheelchair because of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|his paralytic illness]]. In the 1990s, [[Hillary Clinton]], at the suggestion of Visitors Office Director Melinda N. Bates, approved the addition of a ramp in the East Wing corridor. It allowed easy [[wheelchair]] access for the public tours and special events that enter through the secure entrance building on the east side.\n\nIn 2003, the Bush administration reinstalled solar thermal heaters.{{r|Burdick}} These units are used to heat water for landscape maintenance personnel and for the presidential pool and spa. 167 solar photovoltaic grid-tied panels were installed at the same time on the roof of the maintenance facility. The changes were not publicized as a White House spokeswoman said the changes were an internal matter. The story was picked up by industry trade journals.{{r|FCAxL}} In 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] had a set of [[solar panel]]s installed on the roof of the White House, making it the first time solar power would be used for the president's living quarters.{{r|ztiyM}}{{r|BA0aA}}\n\n===Layout and amenities===\n\nToday the group of buildings housing the presidency is known as the White House Complex. It includes the central [[Executive Residence]] flanked by the [[East Wing]] and [[West Wing]]. The [[White House Chief Usher|Chief Usher]] coordinates day to day household operations. The White House includes: six stories and 55,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup> (5,100 m<sup>2</sup>) of floor space, 132 rooms and 35 bathrooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, twenty-eight fireplaces, eight staircases, three elevators, five full-time chefs, a tennis court, a (single-lane) bowling alley, a movie theater (officially called the [[White House Family Theater]]{{r|JDYhZ}}), a jogging track, a swimming pool, and a putting green.{{r|WH facts}} It receives up to 30,000 visitors each week.{{r|bumiller200901}}\n{{multiple image\n | align =center\n | direction =horizontal\n | perrow = 3\n | image1 = White House and grounds.png\n | width1 = 68\n | caption1 = Layout of entire site\n | image2 = WHComplex.svg\n | width2 = 300\n | caption2 = White House Complex\n | image3 = White House West Wing FloorPlan1.svg\n | width3 = 168\n | caption3 = [[West Wing]]\n | image4 = WHground.svg\n | width4 = 150\n | caption4 = Ground floor\n | image5 = White House State Floor.svg\n | width5 = 153\n | caption5 = State floor\n | image6 = White House FloorPlan2.svg\n | width6 = 150\n | caption6 = Second floor (residence)\n}}\n\n===Executive Residence===\n{{Main|Executive Residence}}\n\nThe original residence is in the center. Two [[colonnade]]s\u2014one on the east and one on the west\u2014designed by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings added later. The [[Executive Residence]] houses the president's dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining. The State Floor of the residence building includes the [[East Room]], [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]], [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]], [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], [[State Dining Room]], [[Family Dining Room]], [[Cross Hall]], [[Entrance Hall]], and [[Grand Staircase (White House)|Grand Staircase]].{{r|OwkS5}} The Ground Floor is made up of the [[Diplomatic Reception Room]], [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]], [[China Room]], [[Vermeil Room]], [[White House Library|Library]], the main kitchen, and other offices.{{r|8vyYA}} The second floor family residence includes the [[Yellow Oval Room]], [[East Sitting Hall|East]] and [[West Sitting Hall]]s, the White House Master Bedroom, [[President's Dining Room]], the [[Treaty Room]], [[Lincoln Bedroom]] and [[Queens' Bedroom]], as well as two additional bedrooms, a smaller kitchen, and a private dressing room.{{r|S4zYx}} The third floor consists of the White House Solarium, Game Room, Linen Room, a Diet Kitchen, and another sitting room (previously used as President George W. Bush's workout room).{{r|gqDUm}}\n\n===West Wing===\n{{Main|West Wing}}\n\nThe West Wing houses the president's office (the [[Oval Office]]) and offices of his senior staff, with room for about 50 employees. It also includes the [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]], where the president conducts business meetings and where the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meets,{{r|kzExn}} as well as the [[White House Situation Room]], [[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room]], and [[Roosevelt Room]].{{r|cQOP2}} In 2007, work was completed on renovations of the press briefing room, adding [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] cables and [[LCD]] screens for the display of charts and graphs.{{r|press room2}} The makeover took 11 months and cost of $8 million, out of which news outlets paid $2 million.{{r|press room2}} In September 2010, [[White House Big Dig|a two-year project]] began on the West Wing, creating a multistory underground structure.{{r|vyYFd}}\n\nSome members of the President's staff are located in the adjacent [[Old Executive Office Building]], formerly the State War and Navy building, and sometimes known as the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.{{r|press room2}}\n\nThe Oval Office, Roosevelt Room, and other portions of the West Wing were partially replicated on a [[sound stage]] and used as the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] for the popular television show ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]''.{{r|wKroZ}}\n\n===East Wing===\n{{Main|East Wing}}\n\nThe East Wing, which contains additional office space, was added to the White House in 1942. Among its uses, the East Wing has intermittently housed the offices and staff of the [[First Lady of the United States|first lady]], and the White House Social Office. [[Rosalynn Carter]], in 1977, was the first to place her personal office in the East Wing and to formally call it the \"Office of the First Lady\". The East Wing was built during [[World War II]] in order to hide the construction of an underground bunker to be used in emergencies. The bunker has come to be known as the [[Presidential Emergency Operations Center]].\n\n===Grounds===\nThe White House and grounds cover just over 18 acres (about 7.3 hectares). Before the construction of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the [[South Lawn (White House)|South Lawn]], which was graded and planted by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the [[North Lawn (White House)|North Lawn]] that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger [[greenhouse]]s were built on the west side of the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds. The general layout of the White House grounds today is based on the 1935 design by [[Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.]] of the [[Olmsted Brothers]] firm, commissioned by  President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the Kennedy administration, the [[White House Rose Garden]] was redesigned by [[Rachel Lambert Mellon]]. The Rose Garden borders the West Colonnade. Bordering the East Colonnade is the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Garden]], which was begun by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] but completed after her husband's assassination. On the weekend of June 23, 2006, a century-old [[American Elm|American Elm (''Ulmus americana'' L.)]] tree on the north side of the building came down during one of the many storms amid [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006|intense flooding]]. Among the oldest trees on the grounds are several magnolias (''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'') planted by Andrew Jackson, including the Jackson Magnolia, reportedly grown from a sprout taken from the favorite tree of Jackson's recently deceased wife, the sprout planted after Jackson moved into the White House. The tree stood for over 200 years; but in 2017, having become too weak to stand on its own, it was decided it should be removed and replaced with one of its offspring.{{r|CcD01}}{{r|KpnOF}} Michelle Obama planted the White House's first organic garden and installed beehives on the South Lawn of the White House, which will supply organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.{{r|U4C8Y}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:White-house-floor1-cross-Hall.jpg|The [[Cross Hall]], connecting the [[State Dining Room]] and the [[East Room]] on the State Floor\nFile:WhSouthLawn.JPEG|[[Marine One]] prepares to land on the South Lawn, where [[State Arrival Ceremony|State Arrival Ceremonies]] are held.\nFile:White House, Blue Sky.jpg|View from the south, with fountain\nFile:1122-WAS-The White House.JPG|View from the north\nFile:The White House at night, 2011.jpg|White House at night, view from the north\n</gallery>\n\n==Public access and security==\n{{See also|White House Visitors Office|List of White House security breaches}}\n\n===Historical accessibility===\nLike the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] followed him home, where he greeted them in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President [[Andrew Jackson]] had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected [[Grover Cleveland]] arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President [[Bill Clinton]] briefly revived the New Year's Day open house in his first term.\n\nThe White House remained accessible in other ways; President [[Abraham Lincoln]] complained that he was constantly beleaguered by job seekers waiting to ask him for political appointments or other favors, or eccentric dispensers of advice like \"General\" [[Daniel Pratt (eccentric)|Daniel Pratt]], as he began the business day. Lincoln put up with the annoyance rather than risk alienating some associate or friend of a powerful politician or opinion maker.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Aviation incidents===\n{{Update|section|date=April 2015}}<!-- April 15, 2015 incident; possibly January 2015 if drones count -->\nIn February 1974, a stolen army helicopter [[1974 White House helicopter incident|landed without authorization]] on the White House's grounds.{{r|bXgDO}} Twenty years later, in 1994, a light plane flown by [[Frank Eugene Corder]] crashed on the White House grounds, and he died instantly.{{r|JO4kZ}}\n\nAs a result of increased security regarding air traffic in the capital, the White House was evacuated in May 2005 before an unauthorized aircraft could approach the grounds.{{r|ZScbt}}\n\n===Closure of Pennsylvania Avenue===\n[[File:U.S. Secret Service Agent.jpg|left|thumb|A uniformed U.S. Secret Service Agent on Pennsylvania Avenue.]]\nOn May 20, 1995, primarily as a response to the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] of April 19, 1995, the [[United States Secret Service]] closed off Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White House from the eastern edge of Lafayette Park to 17th Street. Later, the closure was extended an additional block to the east to 15th Street, and East Executive Avenue, a small street between the White House and the [[Treasury Building (Washington, D.C.)|Treasury Building]].\n\nAfter [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], this change was made permanent in addition to closing E Street between the South Portico of the White House and [[the Ellipse]].{{r|VuiCP}} In response to the [[Boston Marathon bombing]], the road was closed to the public in its entirety for a period of two days.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Avenue closing has been opposed by organized civic groups in Washington, D.C. They argue that the closing impedes traffic flow unnecessarily and is inconsistent with the well-conceived historic plan for the city. As for security considerations, they note that the White House is set much farther back from the street than numerous other sensitive federal buildings are.{{r|F17OZ}}\n\nPrior to its inclusion within the fenced compound that now includes the [[Old Executive Office Building]] to the west and the Treasury Building to the east, this sidewalk served as a queuing area for the daily public tours of the White House. These tours were suspended in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. In September 2003, they resumed on a limited basis for groups making prior arrangements through their Congressional representatives or embassies in Washington for foreign nationals and submitting to background checks, but the White House remained closed to the public.{{r|6Dutd}} White House tours were suspended for most of 2013 due to budget constraints after [[Budget sequestration in 2013|sequestration]].{{r|1xVao}} The White House reopened to the public in November 2013.{{r|msl6S}}\n\n===Protection===\nThe White House Complex is protected by the [[United States Secret Service]] and the [[United States Park Police]].\n\n[[NASAMS]] (Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System) were used to guard air space over Washington, D.C. during the 2005 presidential inauguration.

It is located at 1600 [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and has been the residence of every U.S. president since [[John Adams]] in 1800. The term \"White House\" is often used as a [[metonym]] for the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|president and his advisers]].\n\nThe residence was designed by Irish-born architect [[James Hoban]]{{r|TSGjH}} in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. Hoban modelled the building on [[Leinster House]] in [[Dublin]], a building which today houses the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish legislature. Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using [[Aquia Creek sandstone]] painted white. When [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]]) added low [[colonnade]]s on each wing that concealed stables and storage.{{r|bwDpG}}  In 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the mansion was set ablaze by the [[British Army]] in the [[Burning of Washington]], destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President [[James Monroe]] moved into the partially reconstructed [[Executive Residence]] in October 1817. Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829.\n\nBecause of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed [[West Wing]] in 1901. Eight years later in 1909, President [[William Howard Taft]] expanded the West Wing and created the first [[Oval Office]], which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor [[attic]] was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing [[hip roof]] with long shed dormers. A newly constructed [[East Wing]] was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the residence's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under [[Harry S. Truman]], the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing [[steel frame]] constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.\n\nThe modern-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building]]\u2014the former State Department, which now houses offices for the president's staff and the vice president\u2014and [[Blair House]], a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six stories\u2014the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story [[White House basement|basement]]. The property is a [[National Heritage Site (United States)|National Heritage Site]] owned by the [[National Park Service]] and is part of the [[President's Park]]. In 2007, it was ranked second{{r|1AvjX}} on the [[American Institute of Architects]] list of \"[[America's Favorite Architecture]]\".\n\n==Early history==\n\n===1789\u20131800===\n{{further|Presidency of George Washington#Residences}}\nFollowing his April 1789 inauguration, President [[George Washington]] occupied two private houses in New York City as the executive mansion. He lived at the first, known as the [[Samuel Osgood House|Franklin House]] and owned by Treasury Commissioner [[Samuel Osgood]], at 3 Cherry Street through late February 1790.{{r|Baker1897}}{{r|mvorg}}  The executive mansion moved to the larger quarters of the [[Alexander Macomb House]] at 39\u201341 Broadway{{r|mvorg}} where he stayed, with his wife and a small staff until August 1790. In May 1790, New York began construction of a \"proper\" house for the presidential mansion, [[Government House (New York City)|Government House]].{{r|Stokes}} Washington never used the mansion because it was not completed until after the national capital was moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in December 1790.{{r|Stokes}}\n\nThe July 1790 [[Residence Act]] designated the capital be permanently located in the new [[Washington, D.C.|Federal District]], and temporarily in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] for ten years while the permanent capital was built.{{r|6ylva}} Philadelphia rented the mansion of the wealthy merchant [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] at 190 High Street (now 524\u201330 Market Street) as the [[President's House (Philadelphia)|President's House]], which Washington occupied from November 1790 to March 1797.{{r|ushist}}  Since the house was too small to accommodate the thirty people that made up the presidential family, staff, and servants, Washington had it enlarged.{{r|ushist}} \n\nPresident [[John Adams]] also occupied the High Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On Saturday, November 1, 1800, he became the first president to occupy the White House.{{r|jK8YA}}\n\nThe President's House in Philadelphia was converted into the Union Hotel, and later used for stores before being demolished in 1832.{{r|ushist}}\n\nPhiladelphia began construction of a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away in 1792. It was nearly completed by the time of Adam's 1797 inauguration. However, Adams declined to occupy it saying he did not have Congressional authorization to lease the building. It remained vacant until it was sold to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1800.{{r|Westcott1894}}\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=100px>\nFile:The First Presidential Mansion.jpg|First Presidential Mansion: [[Samuel Osgood House]], Manhattan, New York.

However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the U.S., [[Jean Jules Jusserand]], popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, \"Pierre Charles L'Enfant\". (Reference: Bowling, Kenneth R (2002). ''Peter Charles L'Enfant: vision, honor, and male friendship in the early American Republic.'' George Washington University, Washington, D.C. {{ISBN|978-0-9727611-0-9}}). The [[United States Code]] states in {{USC|40|3309}}: \"(a) In General.\u2014The purposes of this chapter shall be carried out in the District of Columbia as nearly as may be practicable in harmony with the plan of Peter Charles L'Enfant.\" The [[National Park Service]] identifies L'Enfant as \"[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/text.htm#washington Major Peter Charles L'Enfant]\" and as \"[https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/presidents/washington_monument.html Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]\" on its website.}} 1791 [[L'Enfant Plan|plan]] for the newly established federal city, Washington, D.C.{{r|IYuWd}} Washington and his Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]], who both had personal interests in architecture, agreed that the design of the White House, and the Capital, would be chosen in a [[Architectural design competition|design competition]].{{r|Frary}}\n\nAlthough all proposals for the Capital were rejected, an acceptable drawing for the White House submitted by [[James Hoban]] was selected from several including one submitted anonymously by Jefferson himself.{{r|np7Jl}}\n\nHoban was born in Ireland and trained at the [[Dublin Society of Arts]]. He emigrated to the US after the revolution, first seeking work in Philadelphia and later finding success in [[South Carolina]] where he designed several buildings including the state capitol at [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]. Hoban ultimately supervised the construction of both the US Capitol and the White House.{{r|u1v6F}}\n\nPresident Washington visited [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in May 1791 on his \"Southern Tour\", and saw the under-construction [[Charleston County Courthouse]] designed by Hoban. He is reputed to have met with Hoban then. The following year, he summoned the architect to Philadelphia and met with him in June 1792.{{r|eYnQA}}\n\nOn July 16, 1792, the president met with the commissioners of the federal city to make his judgment in the architectural competition. His review is recorded as being brief, and he quickly selected Hoban's submission.{{r|nUHxy}}\n\n===Design influences===\nThe building has classical inspiration sources, that could be found directly or indirectly in the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] or in [[Andrea Palladio]] styles; Palladio being an Italian architect of the [[Renaissance]] which had a considerable influence on the Western architecture ([[Palladian architecture]]). The building Hoban designed is verifiably influenced by the upper floors of [[Leinster House]], in [[Dublin]], which later became the seat of the [[Oireachtas]] (the Irish parliament).{{r|Ywh2c}} Several other Georgian-era Irish country houses have been suggested as sources of inspiration for the overall floor plan, details like the bow-fronted south front, and interior details like the former niches in the present [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. These influences, though undocumented, are cited in the official White House guide, and in [[White House Historical Association]] publications. The first official White House guide, published in 1962, suggested a link between Hoban's design for the South Portico and [[Ch\u00e2teau de Rastignac]], a neoclassical country house located in [[La Bachellerie]] in the [[Dordogne]] region of France and designed by Mathurin Salat. Construction on the French house was initially started before 1789, interrupted by the [[French Revolution]] for twenty years and then finally built 1812\u20131817 (based on Salat's pre-1789 design).{{r|France?}} The theoretical link between the two houses has been criticized because Hoban did not visit France. Supporters of a connection posit that [[Thomas Jefferson]], during his tour of [[Bordeaux]] in 1789, viewed Salat's architectural drawings (which were on-file at the College) at the [[\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale d'Architecture]] (Bordeaux Architectural College).{{r|johnson}}  On his return to the U.S. he then shared the influence with Washington, Hoban, Monroe, and [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]].{{r|France?}}\n\n===Construction===\n\nConstruction of the White House began with the laying of the cornerstone on October 13, 1792, although there was no formal ceremony.{{r|yLpeA}} The main residence, as well as foundations of the house, were built largely by [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] and free [[African-American]] laborers, as well as employed Europeans.{{r|mJ52j}} Much of the other work on the house was performed by immigrants, many not yet with citizenship. The sandstone walls were erected by [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrants, employed by Hoban,{{r|whha overview}} as were the high-relief rose and garland decorations above the north entrance and the \"fish scale\" pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods. There are conflicting claims as to where the sandstone used in the construction of the White House originated. Some reports suggest sandstone from the [[Croatia]]n island of [[Bra\u010d]] (specifically the [[Pu\u010di\u0161\u0107a]] querry whose stone was used to build the ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Diocletian's Palace|palace]] of [[Diocletian|Emperor Diocletian]]) was used in the original construction of the building, contrarily researchers believe limestone from the island was used in the 1902 renovations and not the original construction. Others suggest the original sandstone simply came from [[Aquia Creek]] in [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]], [[Virginia]], as importing the stone would be too costly.{{r|zQgqd}}{{r|L0Ydi}}{{r|J1ZuL}} The initial construction took place over a period of eight years, at a reported cost of $232,371.83 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|232371.83|1800}}}} today). Although not yet completed, the White House was ready for occupancy circa November 1, 1800.{{r|XEjY4}}\n\nShortages, including material and labor, forced alterations to the earlier plan developed by French engineer [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] for a \"palace\" that was five times larger than the house that was eventually built.{{r|whha overview}} The finished structure contained only two main floors instead of the planned three, and a less costly brick served as a lining for the stone fa\u00e7ades. When construction was finished, the porous sandstone walls were [[whitewash]]ed with a mixture of lime, rice glue, casein, and lead, giving the house its familiar color and name.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nSeveral [[replicas of the White House]] have been constructed.\n\n===Architectural description===\n\nThe north front is the principal fa\u00e7ade of the White House and consists of three floors and eleven bays. The ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and [[parapet]], thus the fa\u00e7ade appears to be of two floors. The central three bays are behind a [[Prostyle|prostyle portico]] (this was a later addition to the house, built circa 1830) serving, thanks to the carriage ramp, as a [[porte cochere]]. The windows of the four bays flanking the portico, at first-floor level, have alternating pointed and segmented [[pediment]]s, while at second-floor level the pediments are flat. The principal entrance at the center of the portico is surmounted by a [[lunette]] [[fanlight]]. Above the entrance is a sculpted floral [[festoon]]. The roofline is hidden by a balustraded [[parapet]].\n\nThe mansion's southern fa\u00e7ade is a combination of the [[Palladian]] and neoclassical styles of architecture. It is of three floors, all visible. The ground floor is [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] in the Palladian fashion. At the center of the fa\u00e7ade is a neoclassical projecting bow of three bays. The bow is flanked by five bays, the windows of which, as on the north fa\u00e7ade, have alternating segmented and pointed pediments at first-floor level. The bow has a ground floor [[double staircase]] leading to an [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[colonnade]]d [[loggia]] (with the [[Truman Balcony]] at second-floor level), known as the south portico. The more modern third floor is hidden by a balustraded parapet and plays no part in the composition of the fa\u00e7ade.\n\n===Naming conventions===\n\nThe building was originally variously referred to as the \"President's Palace\", \"Presidential Mansion\", or \"President's House\".{{r|xVvhI}} The earliest evidence of the public calling it the \"White House\" was recorded in 1811.{{r|8Rmlj}} A myth emerged that during the rebuilding of the structure after the [[Burning of Washington]], white paint was applied to mask the burn damage it had suffered,{{r|A3bMb}} giving the building its namesake hue.{{r|EdqBf}} The name \"Executive Mansion\" was used in official contexts until President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established the formal name by having \"White House\u2013Washington\" engraved on the stationery in 1901.{{r|Qtiju}}{{r|WH facts}} The current letterhead wording and arrangement \"The White House\" with the word \"Washington\" centered beneath goes back to the administration of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].{{r|WH facts}}\n\nAlthough the structure was not completed until some years after the presidency of George Washington, there is speculation that the name of the traditional residence of the president of the United States may have derived from [[Martha Washington]]'s home, [[White House (plantation)|White House Plantation]] in Virginia, where the nation's first president had courted the first lady in the mid-18th century.{{r|D7o2v}}\n\n==Evolution of the White House==\n\n===Early use, the 1814 fire, and rebuilding===\n\nOn Saturday, November 1, 1800, [[John Adams]] became the first president to take residence in the building.{{r|whha overview}} The next day he wrote his wife Abigail:\n\"I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.\"{{r|whha state dining room}} \nFranklin D. Roosevelt had Adams's blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room.{{r|whha state dining room}}\n\nAdams lived in the house only briefly before [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the \"pleasant country residence\"{{r|NRJJd}} in 1801. Despite his complaints that the house was too big (\"big enough for two emperors, one pope, and the grand lama in the bargain\"{{r|sacjA}}), Jefferson considered how the White House might be added to. With [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], he helped lay out the design for the East and West Colonnades, small wings that help conceal the domestic operations of laundry, a stable and storage.{{r|whha overview}} Today, Jefferson's colonnades link the residence with the East and West Wings.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nIn 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the White House was set ablaze by British troops{{r|whha east room}} during the [[Burning of Washington]], in retaliation for burning of [[Port Dover]] and other towns in [[Upper Canada]]; much of Washington was affected by these fires as well. Only the exterior walls remained, and they had to be torn down and mostly reconstructed because of weakening from the fire and subsequent exposure to the elements, except for portions of the south wall. Of the numerous objects taken from the White House when it was ransacked by British troops, only two have been recovered. Employees and slaves rescued a painting of George Washington,{{r|whha east room}} and in 1939, a Canadian man returned a jewelry box to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], claiming that his grandfather had taken it from Washington. Some observers allege that most of these spoils were lost when a convoy of British ships led by [[HMS Fantome (1810)|HMS ''Fantome'']] sank en route to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] off [[Prospect, Nova Scotia|Prospect]] during a storm on the night of November 24, 1814,{{r|K9M68}}{{r|iDYQ3}} even though ''Fantome'' had no involvement in that action.{{r|2ZhT4}}\n\nAfter the fire, President [[James Madison]] resided in [[The Octagon House (Washington, D.C.)|the Octagon House]] from 1814 to 1815, and then the [[Seven Buildings]] from 1815 to the end of his term.{{r|KQzqy}} Meanwhile, both architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe and Hoban contributed to the design and oversight of the reconstruction, which lasted from 1815 until 1817. The south [[portico]] was constructed in 1824 during the [[James Monroe]] administration; the north portico was built six years later.{{r|whha overview}} Though Latrobe proposed similar porticos before the fire in 1814, both porticos were built as designed by Hoban.{{r|tbe3z}} An elliptical portico at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Rastignac]] in La Bachellerie, France with nearly identical curved stairs is speculated as the source of inspiration due to its similarity with the South Portico,{{r|wh museum 1825-1872}} although this matter is one of great debate.{{r|wSPdx}} Italian artisans, brought to Washington to help in constructing the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]], carved the decorative stonework on both porticos. Contrary to speculation, the North Portico was not modeled on a similar portico on another Dublin building, the [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in|Viceregal Lodge]] (now ''\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in'', residence of the [[President of Ireland]]), for its portico postdates the White House porticos' design.{{r|wh museum 1825-1872}} For the North Portico, a variation on the [[Ionic Order]] was devised incorporating a swag of roses between the volutes. This was done to link the new portico with the earlier carved roses above the entrance.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:The President's House by George Munger, 1814-1815 - Crop.jpg|The White House as it looked following the fire of August 24, 1814\nFile:White-House.jpg|[[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Latrobe]]'s West Wing Colonnade, in this nineteenth-century engraved view, is now the [[James S.

The location of the White House was questioned, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for [[malaria]] and other unhealthy conditions.{{r|epstein}} Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler was tasked to propose solutions to address these concerns. He proposed abandoning the use of the White House as a residence and designed a new estate for the first family at [[Meridian Hill Park|Meridian Hill]] in Washington, D.C., but Congress rejected the plan.{{r|epstein}} Another site under consideration was Metropolis View, today the campus of [[The Catholic University of America]].{{r|MqIIY}}\n\n[[File:WhiteHouseProposedAddition.jpg|thumb|right|Additions proposed by architect Frederick D. Owen (1901).]]\n[[File:1860s White House.jpg|thumb|right|The [[North Lawn (White House)|North Lawn]] during the [[Abraham Lincoln]] administration]]\n\nWhen [[Chester A. Arthur]] took office in 1881, he ordered renovations to the White House to take place as soon as the recently widowed [[Lucretia Garfield]] moved out. Arthur inspected the work almost nightly and made several suggestions. [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] was asked to send selected designers to assist. Over twenty wagonloads of furniture and household items were removed from the building and sold at a [[public auction]].{{r|reeves268}} All that was saved were bust portraits of [[John Adams]] and [[Martin Van Buren]].{{r|reevesn473}} A proposal was made to build a new residence south of the White House, but it failed to gain support.\n\nIn the fall of 1882 work was done on the main corridor, including tinting the walls pale olive and adding squares of [[gold leaf]], and decorating the ceiling in gold and silver, and colorful [[Tracery|traceries]] woven to spell \"USA\". The Red Room was painted a dull Pomeranian red, and its ceiling was decorated with gold, silver, and copper stars and stripes of red, white, and blue. A fifty-foot jeweled [[Tiffany glass|Tiffany]] glass screen, supported by imitation marble columns, replaced the glass doors that separated the main corridor from the north vestibule.{{r|reeves269}}{{r|bFjvZ}}\n\nIn 1891, First Lady [[Caroline Harrison]] proposed major extensions to the White House, including a National Wing on the east for a historical art gallery, and a wing on the west for official functions.{{r|epstein}} A plan was devised by Colonel Theodore A. Bingham, which reflected the Harrison proposal.{{r|epstein}} These plans were ultimately rejected.\n\nHowever, in 1902 [[Theodore Roosevelt]] hired [[McKim, Mead & White]] to carry out expansions and renovations in a neoclassical style suited to the building's architecture, removing the Tiffany screen and all Victorian additions.{{r|Yl4bH}}{{r|R6fqD}}  [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles McKim]] himself designed and managed the project, which gave more living space to the president's large family by removing a staircase in the West Hall and moving executive office staff from the second floor of the residence into the new West Wing.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nPresident [[William Howard Taft]] enlisted the help of architect [[Nathan C. Wyeth]] to add additional space to the West Wing, which included the addition of the [[Oval Office]].{{r|epstein}}  In 1925, Congress enacted legislation allowing the White House to accept gifts of furniture and art for the first time.{{r|AbbottRice|p=17}} The West Wing was damaged by fire on Christmas Eve 1929; [[Herbert Hoover]] and his aides moved back into it on April 14, 1930.{{r|oeGVZ}} \nIn the 1930s, a second story was added, as well as a larger basement for White House staff, and President Franklin Roosevelt had the Oval Office moved to its present location: adjacent to the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]].{{r|whha overview}}\n\n===Truman reconstruction===\n{{main|White House Reconstruction}}\n[[File:The Shell of the White House during the Renovation-05-17-1950.jpg|thumb|[[Harry S.

Truman]]{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} took a great toll on the brick and sandstone structure built around a timber frame.{{r|whha overview}} By 1948, the house was declared to be in imminent danger of collapse, forcing President Truman to commission a reconstruction and to live across the street at [[Blair House]] from 1949 to 1951.{{r|OA7bu}} The work, done by the firm of [[Philadelphia]] contractor [[John McShain]], required the complete dismantling of the interior spaces, construction of a new load-bearing internal steel frame and the reconstruction of the original rooms within the new structure.{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} The total cost of the renovations was about $5.7 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5.7|1951|r=0}}}} million in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{r|vm2mG}} Some modifications to the floor plan were made, the largest being the repositioning of the grand staircase to open into the Entrance Hall, rather than the Cross Hall.{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} Central air conditioning was added, as well as two additional sub-basements providing space for workrooms, storage, and a bomb shelter.{{r|whha overview}} The Trumans moved back into the White House on March 27, 1952.{{r|whha overview}} While the house's structure was kept intact by the Truman reconstruction, much of the new interior finishes were generic, and of little historic value. Much of the original plasterwork, some dating back to the 1814\u20131816 rebuilding, was too damaged to reinstall, as was the original robust Beaux Arts paneling in the East Room. President Truman had the original timber frame sawn into paneling; the walls of the [[Vermeil Room]], [[Library (White House)|Library]], [[China Room]], and [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]] on the ground floor of the main residence were paneled in wood from the timbers.{{r|UtzOl}}\n\n===Jacqueline Kennedy restoration===\n[[File:BoudinRedRoom.jpg|thumb|The [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]] as designed by [[St\u00e9phane Boudin]] during the presidency of John F.

She enlisted the help of [[Henry Francis du Pont]] of the [[Winterthur Museum]] to assist in collecting artifacts for the mansion, many of which had once been housed there.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} Other antiques, fine paintings, and improvements of the Kennedy period were donated to the White House by wealthy philanthropists, including the [[Crowninshield family]], [[Jane Engelhard]], [[Jayne Wrightsman]], and the Oppenheimer family.\n\n[[St\u00e9phane Boudin]] of the [[Maison Jansen|House of Jansen]], a Paris interior-design firm that had been recognized worldwide, was employed by Jacqueline Kennedy to assist with the decoration.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} Different periods of the early republic and world history were selected as a theme for each room: the Federal style for the [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]], French Empire for the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]], American Empire for the [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], Louis XVI for the [[Yellow Oval Room]], and Victorian for the president's study, renamed the [[Treaty Room]]. Antique furniture was acquired, and decorative fabric and trim based on period documents was produced and installed. The Kennedy restoration resulted in a more authentic White House of grander stature, which recalled the French taste of Madison and Monroe.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} In the [[Diplomatic Reception Room (White House)|Diplomatic Reception Room]], Mrs. Kennedy installed an antique \"Vue de l'Am\u00e9rique Nord\" wallpaper which [[Zuber & Cie]] had designed in 1834. The wallpaper had hung previously on the walls of another mansion until 1961 when that house was demolished for a grocery store. Just before the demolition, the wallpaper was salvaged and sold to the White House.\n\nThe first White House guidebook was produced under the direction of curator Lorraine Waxman Pearce with direct supervision from Mrs. Kennedy.{{r|OLizx}} Sale of the guidebook helped finance the restoration.\n\nKennedy showed her restoration of the White House to the public in [[A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F.

This prevented them from being sold (as many objects in the executive mansion had been in the past 150 years). When not in use or display at the White House, these items were to be turned over to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for preservation, study, storage, or exhibition. The White House retains the right to have these items returned.{{r|AbbottRice|p=29}}\n\nOut of respect for the historic character of the White House, no substantive architectural changes have been made to the house since the Truman renovation.{{r|YsEpb}} Since the Kennedy restoration, every presidential family has made some changes to the private quarters of the White House, but the [[Committee for the Preservation of the White House]] must approve any modifications to the State Rooms. Charged with maintaining the historical integrity of the White House, the congressionally authorized committee works with each First Family\u2014usually represented by the first lady, the [[White House Office of the Curator|White House curator]], and the [[White House Chief Usher|chief usher]]\u2014to implement the family's proposals for altering the house.{{r|nJVBo}}\n\nDuring the Nixon Administration (1969\u20131974), First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] refurbished the Green Room, Blue Room, and Red Room, working with Clement Conger, the curator appointed by President [[Richard Nixon]].{{r|t2zEz}} Mrs. Nixon's efforts brought more than 600 artifacts to the house, the largest acquisition by any administration.{{r|MF74M}} Her husband created the modern press briefing room over [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s old swimming pool.{{r|press room}} Nixon also added a single-lane bowling alley to the White House basement.{{r|gMser}}\n\nComputers and the first laser printer were added during the Carter administration, and the use of computer technology was expanded during the Reagan administration.{{r|gff8t}} A Carter-era innovation, a set of [[solar heating|solar water heating panels]] that were mounted on the roof of the White House, was removed during Reagan's presidency.{{r|wq6cM}}{{r|Burdick}} Redecorations were made to the private family quarters and maintenance was made to public areas during the Reagan years.{{r|da1980}} The house was accredited as a museum in 1988.{{r|da1980}}\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] refurbished some rooms with the assistance of [[Arkansas]] decorator Kaki Hockersmith, including the Oval Office, the East Room, Blue Room, [[State Dining Room of the White House|State Dining Room]], Lincoln Bedroom, and Lincoln Sitting Room.{{r|wh makeover}} During the administration of [[George W. Bush]], First Lady [[Laura Bush]] refurbished the Lincoln Bedroom in a style contemporary with the Lincoln era; the Green Room, [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]], and theater were also refurbished.{{r|wh makeover}}\n\nThe White House became one of the first wheelchair-accessible government buildings in Washington when modifications were made during the presidency of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who used a wheelchair because of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|his paralytic illness]]. In the 1990s, [[Hillary Clinton]], at the suggestion of Visitors Office Director Melinda N. Bates, approved the addition of a ramp in the East Wing corridor. It allowed easy [[wheelchair]] access for the public tours and special events that enter through the secure entrance building on the east side.\n\nIn 2003, the Bush administration reinstalled solar thermal heaters.{{r|Burdick}} These units are used to heat water for landscape maintenance personnel and for the presidential pool and spa. 167 solar photovoltaic grid-tied panels were installed at the same time on the roof of the maintenance facility. The changes were not publicized as a White House spokeswoman said the changes were an internal matter. The story was picked up by industry trade journals.{{r|FCAxL}} In 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] had a set of [[solar panel]]s installed on the roof of the White House, making it the first time solar power would be used for the president's living quarters.{{r|ztiyM}}{{r|BA0aA}}\n\n===Layout and amenities===\n\nToday the group of buildings housing the presidency is known as the White House Complex. It includes the central [[Executive Residence]] flanked by the [[East Wing]] and [[West Wing]]. The [[White House Chief Usher|Chief Usher]] coordinates day to day household operations. The White House includes: six stories and 55,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup> (5,100 m<sup>2</sup>) of floor space, 132 rooms and 35 bathrooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, twenty-eight fireplaces, eight staircases, three elevators, five full-time chefs, a tennis court, a (single-lane) bowling alley, a movie theater (officially called the [[White House Family Theater]]{{r|JDYhZ}}), a jogging track, a swimming pool, and a putting green.{{r|WH facts}} It receives up to 30,000 visitors each week.{{r|bumiller200901}}\n{{multiple image\n | align =center\n | direction =horizontal\n | perrow = 3\n | image1 = White House and grounds.png\n | width1 = 68\n | caption1 = Layout of entire site\n | image2 = WHComplex.svg\n | width2 = 300\n | caption2 = White House Complex\n | image3 = White House West Wing FloorPlan1.svg\n | width3 = 168\n | caption3 = [[West Wing]]\n | image4 = WHground.svg\n | width4 = 150\n | caption4 = Ground floor\n | image5 = White House State Floor.svg\n | width5 = 153\n | caption5 = State floor\n | image6 = White House FloorPlan2.svg\n | width6 = 150\n | caption6 = Second floor (residence)\n}}\n\n===Executive Residence===\n{{Main|Executive Residence}}\n\nThe original residence is in the center. Two [[colonnade]]s\u2014one on the east and one on the west\u2014designed by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings added later. The [[Executive Residence]] houses the president's dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining. The State Floor of the residence building includes the [[East Room]], [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]], [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]], [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], [[State Dining Room]], [[Family Dining Room]], [[Cross Hall]], [[Entrance Hall]], and [[Grand Staircase (White House)|Grand Staircase]].{{r|OwkS5}} The Ground Floor is made up of the [[Diplomatic Reception Room]], [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]], [[China Room]], [[Vermeil Room]], [[White House Library|Library]], the main kitchen, and other offices.{{r|8vyYA}} The second floor family residence includes the [[Yellow Oval Room]], [[East Sitting Hall|East]] and [[West Sitting Hall]]s, the White House Master Bedroom, [[President's Dining Room]], the [[Treaty Room]], [[Lincoln Bedroom]] and [[Queens' Bedroom]], as well as two additional bedrooms, a smaller kitchen, and a private dressing room.{{r|S4zYx}} The third floor consists of the White House Solarium, Game Room, Linen Room, a Diet Kitchen, and another sitting room (previously used as President George W. Bush's workout room).{{r|gqDUm}}\n\n===West Wing===\n{{Main|West Wing}}\n\nThe West Wing houses the president's office (the [[Oval Office]]) and offices of his senior staff, with room for about 50 employees. It also includes the [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]], where the president conducts business meetings and where the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meets,{{r|kzExn}} as well as the [[White House Situation Room]], [[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room]], and [[Roosevelt Room]].{{r|cQOP2}} In 2007, work was completed on renovations of the press briefing room, adding [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] cables and [[LCD]] screens for the display of charts and graphs.{{r|press room2}} The makeover took 11 months and cost of $8 million, out of which news outlets paid $2 million.{{r|press room2}} In September 2010, [[White House Big Dig|a two-year project]] began on the West Wing, creating a multistory underground structure.{{r|vyYFd}}\n\nSome members of the President's staff are located in the adjacent [[Old Executive Office Building]], formerly the State War and Navy building, and sometimes known as the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.{{r|press room2}}\n\nThe Oval Office, Roosevelt Room, and other portions of the West Wing were partially replicated on a [[sound stage]] and used as the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] for the popular television show ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]''.{{r|wKroZ}}\n\n===East Wing===\n{{Main|East Wing}}\n\nThe East Wing, which contains additional office space, was added to the White House in 1942. Among its uses, the East Wing has intermittently housed the offices and staff of the [[First Lady of the United States|first lady]], and the White House Social Office. [[Rosalynn Carter]], in 1977, was the first to place her personal office in the East Wing and to formally call it the \"Office of the First Lady\". The East Wing was built during [[World War II]] in order to hide the construction of an underground bunker to be used in emergencies. The bunker has come to be known as the [[Presidential Emergency Operations Center]].\n\n===Grounds===\nThe White House and grounds cover just over 18 acres (about 7.3 hectares). Before the construction of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the [[South Lawn (White House)|South Lawn]], which was graded and planted by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the [[North Lawn (White House)|North Lawn]] that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger [[greenhouse]]s were built on the west side of the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds. The general layout of the White House grounds today is based on the 1935 design by [[Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.]] of the [[Olmsted Brothers]] firm, commissioned by  President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the Kennedy administration, the [[White House Rose Garden]] was redesigned by [[Rachel Lambert Mellon]]. The Rose Garden borders the West Colonnade. Bordering the East Colonnade is the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Garden]], which was begun by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] but completed after her husband's assassination. On the weekend of June 23, 2006, a century-old [[American Elm|American Elm (''Ulmus americana'' L.)]] tree on the north side of the building came down during one of the many storms amid [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006|intense flooding]]. Among the oldest trees on the grounds are several magnolias (''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'') planted by Andrew Jackson, including the Jackson Magnolia, reportedly grown from a sprout taken from the favorite tree of Jackson's recently deceased wife, the sprout planted after Jackson moved into the White House. The tree stood for over 200 years; but in 2017, having become too weak to stand on its own, it was decided it should be removed and replaced with one of its offspring.{{r|CcD01}}{{r|KpnOF}} Michelle Obama planted the White House's first organic garden and installed beehives on the South Lawn of the White House, which will supply organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.{{r|U4C8Y}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:White-house-floor1-cross-Hall.jpg|The [[Cross Hall]], connecting the [[State Dining Room]] and the [[East Room]] on the State Floor\nFile:WhSouthLawn.JPEG|[[Marine One]] prepares to land on the South Lawn, where [[State Arrival Ceremony|State Arrival Ceremonies]] are held.\nFile:White House, Blue Sky.jpg|View from the south, with fountain\nFile:1122-WAS-The White House.JPG|View from the north\nFile:The White House at night, 2011.jpg|White House at night, view from the north\n</gallery>\n\n==Public access and security==\n{{See also|White House Visitors Office|List of White House security breaches}}\n\n===Historical accessibility===\nLike the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] followed him home, where he greeted them in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President [[Andrew Jackson]] had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected [[Grover Cleveland]] arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President [[Bill Clinton]] briefly revived the New Year's Day open house in his first term.\n\nThe White House remained accessible in other ways; President [[Abraham Lincoln]] complained that he was constantly beleaguered by job seekers waiting to ask him for political appointments or other favors, or eccentric dispensers of advice like \"General\" [[Daniel Pratt (eccentric)|Daniel Pratt]], as he began the business day. Lincoln put up with the annoyance rather than risk alienating some associate or friend of a powerful politician or opinion maker.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Aviation incidents===\n{{Update|section|date=April 2015}}<!-- April 15, 2015 incident; possibly January 2015 if drones count -->\nIn February 1974, a stolen army helicopter [[1974 White House helicopter incident|landed without authorization]] on the White House's grounds.{{r|bXgDO}} Twenty years later, in 1994, a light plane flown by [[Frank Eugene Corder]] crashed on the White House grounds, and he died instantly.{{r|JO4kZ}}\n\nAs a result of increased security regarding air traffic in the capital, the White House was evacuated in May 2005 before an unauthorized aircraft could approach the grounds.{{r|ZScbt}}\n\n===Closure of Pennsylvania Avenue===\n[[File:U.S. Secret Service Agent.jpg|left|thumb|A uniformed U.S. Secret Service Agent on Pennsylvania Avenue.]]\nOn May 20, 1995, primarily as a response to the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] of April 19, 1995, the [[United States Secret Service]] closed off Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White House from the eastern edge of Lafayette Park to 17th Street. Later, the closure was extended an additional block to the east to 15th Street, and East Executive Avenue, a small street between the White House and the [[Treasury Building (Washington, D.C.)|Treasury Building]].\n\nAfter [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], this change was made permanent in addition to closing E Street between the South Portico of the White House and [[the Ellipse]].{{r|VuiCP}} In response to the [[Boston Marathon bombing]], the road was closed to the public in its entirety for a period of two days.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Avenue closing has been opposed by organized civic groups in Washington, D.C. They argue that the closing impedes traffic flow unnecessarily and is inconsistent with the well-conceived historic plan for the city. As for security considerations, they note that the White House is set much farther back from the street than numerous other sensitive federal buildings are.{{r|F17OZ}}\n\nPrior to its inclusion within the fenced compound that now includes the [[Old Executive Office Building]] to the west and the Treasury Building to the east, this sidewalk served as a queuing area for the daily public tours of the White House. These tours were suspended in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. In September 2003, they resumed on a limited basis for groups making prior arrangements through their Congressional representatives or embassies in Washington for foreign nationals and submitting to background checks, but the White House remained closed to the public.{{r|6Dutd}} White House tours were suspended for most of 2013 due to budget constraints after [[Budget sequestration in 2013|sequestration]].{{r|1xVao}} The White House reopened to the public in November 2013.{{r|msl6S}}\n\n===Protection===\nThe White House Complex is protected by the [[United States Secret Service]] and the [[United States Park Police]].\n\n[[NASAMS]] (Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System) were used to guard air space over Washington, D.C. during the 2005 presidential inauguration. The same NASAMS units have since been used to protect the president and all airspace around the White House, which is strictly prohibited to aircraft.{{r|2YCbp}}{{r|D55GA}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:PennAveWhiteHouse.jpg|For security reasons, the section of Pennsylvania Avenue on the north side of the White House is closed to all vehicular traffic, except government officials.\nFile:US $20 Series 2006 Reverse.jpg|North front of the White House on the reverse (back) of the [[United States twenty-dollar bill|U.S. $20 bill]].\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Pedro Casanave]]\n* [[Camp David]]\n* [[Germantown White House]]\n* [[Graphics and Calligraphy Office]]\n* [[List of largest houses in the United States]]\n* [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Washington, D.C.]]\n* [[List of residences of Presidents of the United States]]\n* [[List of residences of Presidents of the United States#Western White House]]\n* [[Number One Observatory Circle]], residence of the Vice President\n* [[Reportedly haunted locations in the District of Columbia#White House|Reported White House ghosts]]\n* [[:Category:Rooms in the White House]]\n* [[White House Acquisition Trust]]\n* [[White House Chief Calligrapher]]\n* [[White House Chief Floral Designer]]\n* [[White House Christmas tree]]\n* [[White House Communications Agency]]\n* [[White House Endowment Trust]]\n* [[White House Executive Chef]]\n* [[White House Fellows]]\n* ''[[White House History]]''\n* [[White House Social Secretary]]\n{{Div col end}}\n{{Portal bar|Politics|United States}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2013a}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Baker1897\">{{cite book|last=Baker|first=William Spohn|title=Washington After the Revolution: 1784-1799|url=https://archive.org/details/washingtonafter00bakegoog|accessdate=January 15, 2020|year=1897|page=[https://archive.org/details/washingtonafter00bakegoog/page/n125 118]}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mvorg\">{{cite web |title=Presidential Residency in New York |url=https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/presidential-residency-in-new-york/ |website=mountvernon.org |publisher=The Fred W.

To this end, he enrols at the Benjamenta Institute, a school for servants.\n\nWalser based the novel on his own experiences: upon arriving in Berlin in 1905 he attended a school for servants, and served as a butler the following winter.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\nWalser in ''Jakob von Gunten'' uses  an \"ordinary and internalized narrative, turning the novel into what Walser\u2019s translator Christopher Middleton in the novel\u2019s foreword calls, 'an analytic fictional soliloquy'\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ahmadian, M. and Hanif, M.|first=|date=Nov 2018|title=An Existential Crisis: the Significance of the Opening and Concluding Passages of Robert Walser\u2019s Jakob Von Gunten|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328928251_An_Existential_Crisis_the_Significance_of_the_Opening_and_Concluding_Passages_of_Robert_Walser%27s_Jakob_Von_Gunten|journal=Forum for World Literature Studies|volume=10 (3)|pages=463-472|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nJakob von Gunten comes from a well-off family. His father has a car and horse at his disposal and his mother has her own box at the theatre. His brother Johann is a well-known, established artist, who cultivates a bourgeois lifestyle and moves in elite circles. Jakob runs away from home in order to escape the overbearing shadow of his father, an alderman. He joins a school for servants, situated on one floor at the rear of a house in Berlin. The headmaster of the institute is Herr Benjamenta. Due to a lack of teaching staff, the pupils are taught by the headmaster\u2019s sister, Lisa Benjamenta. There are in fact more teachers, but they are either absent or said to be fast asleep. The pupils are trained as servants with the aim of securing a job. The teaching predominantly consists of learning-by-heart from one of the institute\u2019s brochures with the title \"What is the aim of Benjamenta\u2019s School for Boys?\" and from the \"Rules\". The pupils willingly let themselves be treated like children, drilled and pushed hard. A principle of the Institute is: \"Little, but thoroughly\". They are taught how to deal with people in social situations through theory and role-play.\n\nAs a new pupil Jakob is tested by the headmaster. At first he rebels, walks into his office and demands his money back, resenting the poor quality of the education. But then he acquiesces and ends his attempts at revolution.  Jakob later gets mixed up in a fight and receives a hit to the head from the headmaster who doesn\u2019t ascertain who was initially responsible. Jakob does not feel inferior. On the contrary, he has ample self-confidence and considers himself the brightest among his classmates. Jakob considers himself conceited and arrogant. His pride is slightly injured and Jakob presumes that he is being dumbed down by the institute. He knows in any case that he is being made to look small.\n\nThe headmaster confesses to Jakob that he has a fondness for him which he can no longer control. He perceives something special in Jakob. The headmaster has no explanation for this. Jakob is also surprised, but knows how to act around superiors. He wisely says nothing in reply \u2013 even when the headmaster confesses his love for him. When Jakob is supposed to become the friend and confidant of the headmaster the pupil is hesitant. Jakob does not get a job through the headmaster because the headmaster, already over 40, loves someone for the first time and doesn't want to let him go. But then Jakob becomes afraid; the headmaster wants to choke him. Later, however, the headmaster wants to kiss Jakob. Outraged, the splendid young boy refuses.\n\nFrau Benjamenta tells Jakob she is going to die. Herr Benjamenta and Jakob sit in vigil over her dead body before she is taken away. The school has been failing for a long time, with a falling intake of pupils. Jakob agrees to pack up and go travelling with Herr Benjamenta.\n\n==J. M.

Jakob later gets mixed up in a fight and receives a hit to the head from the headmaster who doesn\u2019t ascertain who was initially responsible. Jakob does not feel inferior. On the contrary, he has ample self-confidence and considers himself the brightest among his classmates. Jakob considers himself conceited and arrogant. His pride is slightly injured and Jakob presumes that he is being dumbed down by the institute. He knows in any case that he is being made to look small.\n\nThe headmaster confesses to Jakob that he has a fondness for him which he can no longer control. He perceives something special in Jakob. The headmaster has no explanation for this. Jakob is also surprised, but knows how to act around superiors. He wisely says nothing in reply \u2013 even when the headmaster confesses his love for him. When Jakob is supposed to become the friend and confidant of the headmaster the pupil is hesitant. Jakob does not get a job through the headmaster because the headmaster, already over 40, loves someone for the first time and doesn't want to let him go. But then Jakob becomes afraid; the headmaster wants to choke him. Later, however, the headmaster wants to kiss Jakob. Outraged, the splendid young boy refuses.\n\nFrau Benjamenta tells Jakob she is going to die. Herr Benjamenta and Jakob sit in vigil over her dead body before she is taken away. The school has been failing for a long time, with a falling intake of pupils. Jakob agrees to pack up and go travelling with Herr Benjamenta.\n\n==J. M.

The tail is half as long or slightly shorter than the rest of the body and laterally compressed. During life in water, both sexes develop a tail [[fin]], and males a low, smooth-edged crest on the back. The [[cloaca]] of males swells during breeding season. The skin is smooth during and granular outside breeding season, and velvety during the land phase.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\nAlpine newts are blackish\u2013grey to bluish on the sides and the back, while their belly is an unspotted orange. Males also have a white band with black spots and a light blue flash running along the flanks, from the cheeks to the tail. Their crest, during breeding season, is white with regular dark spots. Females are of a more drab, mottled colour than males. Body shape and colour differ slightly among the subspecies.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\n[[Larvae]] are 7\u20138 mm long after hatching and grow to {{convert|4-5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. They are usually light brown-yellow and darker towards the tail, which ends in a small, pointed filament.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\nThe alpine newt was first described in 1768, as ''Triton alpestris'' from mount [[\u00d6tscher]] in the Austrian Alps (''alpestris'' meaning \"alpine\" in Latin), by Austrian zoologist [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]].{{r|Laurenti1768}} Laurenti thought that males, females and larvae were different species.{{r|Schmidtler2007}} Later, the alpine newt was placed in ''[[Triturus]]'' along with most other European newts. As this genus was found to contain several unrelated lineages, the alpine newt was split off as [[monotypic]] genus ''Mesotriton'' in 2004,{{r|Garcia-Paris2004}} which had been erected as a [[subgenus]] by [[Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef Bolkay]] in 1928.{{r|Bolkay1928}} However, it was argued that a gilled newt Laurenti had described as ''Proteus tritonius'' in fact represented a larva of the alpine newt. The name ''Ichthyosaura'', introduced by [[Sonnini de Manoncourt]] and [[Latreille]] in 1801 for that larva,{{r|SonniniLatreille1802|p=310}} therefore has priority over ''Mesotriton'' and is the [[valid name (zoology)|valid]] genus name.{{r|1=Schmidtler2009|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=9-10}}\n\n==Distribution and subspecies==\n\nThe alpine newt is native to continental Europe. It is relatively common over a large, more or less continuous range from northwestern France to the [[Carpathians]] in Romania, and from southern Denmark in the north to the [[Alps]] and France just north of the Mediterranean in the south, but absent from the [[Pannonian basin]]. Isolated areas of distribution exist in Spain, Italy and Greece.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214\u2013215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=39-46|3=RecueroBuckley2014|4=Raffaelli2018}} Populations have been deliberately [[Introduced species|introduced]] to various places in continental Europe, including within the boundaries of cities such as [[Bremen]] and [[Berlin]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=39-46}} More distant introductions have occurred to [[Great Britain]], mainly England but also Scotland,{{r|BondNHSN}} and New Zealand.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\nA number of geographic [[subspecies]] have been described, but many were not recognised by later authors. Differences in shape and colour are not consistent.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} The ''Handbook of the Amphibians and Reptiles of Europe'' (2003),{{r|Rocek2003}} followed by later authors,{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} recognised four subspecies (see table below). [[Molecular phylogenetics]] confirmed five distinct lineages, which correspond only in part to these subspecies: The western populations of the [[nominate subspecies]] ''I. a. alpestris'', together with the [[Cantabrian]] ''I. a. cyreni'' and the [[Apennines|Apennine]] ''I. a. apuana'' form one group, while the eastern populations are genetically closer to the Greek ''I. a. veluchiensis''.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Several authors argued that these ancient lineages might even represent [[cryptic species]].{{r|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} An article from 2018 accepted four species,{{r|Raffaelli2018}} but this has been considered premature in ''Amphibian Species of the World''.{{r|Frost2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n! colspan=2; style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Subspecies{{r|1=Rocek2003|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=214|3=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=16-36}} !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Distribution !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Alternative classification{{r|Raffaelli2018}}\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| rowspan=2 | ''I. a. alpestris'' {{small|Laurenti, 1768}}<br>\u2013 Alpine newt || western populations || Northwestern France to northern [[Carpathians]] in Romania; southern Denmark in the north; Alps and France north of the Mediterranean in the south || Subspecies ''I. alpestris alpestris''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| eastern populations || [[Balkan peninsula]] north of Greece to Bulgaria and southern Carpathians in Romania || Species ''I. reiseri'', with subspecies ''reiseri'', ''carpathica'' and ''montenegrina''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. apuana'' {{small|Gray, 1850}}<br>\u2013 Apennine alpine newt || Extreme southeastern France, Apennines to [[Lazio]] in central Italy, isolated populations in [[Calabria]] || Species ''I. apuana'', with subspecies ''apuana'' and ''inexpectata'' (Calabria)\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. cyreni'' {{small|Mertens & Muller, 1940}}<br>\u2013 Cantabrian alpine newt || Spain: Cantabrian mountains and [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] (introduced) || Subspecies ''I. alpestris cyreni''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. veluchiensis'' {{small|Wolterstorff, 1935}}<br>\u2013 Greek alpine newt || Greece: mainland and northern [[Peloponnese]] || Species ''I. veluchiensis''\n\n|}\n\n==Habitats==\n\nThe alpine newt can occur at high elevation and has been found up to {{convert|2370|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]] in the Alps. However, it does occur in the lowlands down to sea level. Towards the south of its range, most populations are found above {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=51-59}}\n\nForests, including both [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests (but avoiding pure [[Picea abies|spruce]] plantations), are the main land habitat. Less common are forest edges, [[brownfield land]], or gardens. Populations can be found above [[tree line]] in the high mountains, where they prefer south-exposed slopes. The newts use logs, stones, leaf litter, [[burrow]]s, [[construction waste]] or similar structures as hiding places.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=54-59}}\n\nAquatic breeding sites close to suitable land habitat are critical. While small, cool water bodies in forested areas are preferred, alpine newts tolerate a wide range of permanent or [[vernal pool|non-permanent]], natural or human-made water bodies. These can range from shallow puddles over small ponds to larger, fish-free lakes or reservoirs and quiet parts of streams. Damming by [[Eurasian beaver|beavers]] creates valuable breeding sites. Overall, the alpine newt is tolerant regarding chemical parameters such as [[pH]], [[water hardness]] and [[eutrophication]]. Other European newts such as the [[Northern crested newt|crested]], [[Smooth newt|smooth]], [[Palmate newt|palmate]] or [[Carpathian newt]] often use the same breeding sites, but are less common at higher elevation.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=47-54}}\n\n==Life and behaviour==\n\nAlpine newts are usually [[semiaquatic]], spending most of the year (9-10 months) on land and only returning to the water for breeding. The juvenile [[eft]]s are probably terrestrial throughout the year.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=54}} They reach [[sexual maturity]] at around three years in males, and four to five years in females, and can reach an age of ten years in lowland. At higher altitude, maturity is reached only after 9-11 years, and the newts can grow up to 30 years old.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n===Terrestrial phase===\n\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg | thumb | right | Juvenile hibernating in dead wood]]\n\nOn land, alpine newts are mainly nocturnal, hiding most of the day and moving and feeding during the night or in the [[twighlight]]. They have been observed to climb up to {{convert|2|m|ft}} high vertical walls on wet nights. [[Hibernation]] also usually takes place in hiding places on land.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=105-107}} Migration to breeding sites occurs on sufficiently warm (above 5 \u00b0C) and humid nights and may be delayed or interrupted for several weeks in unfavourable conditions. The newts can also leave the water again in case of a sudden cold snap.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=89-90}}\n\nAlpine newts tend to stay close to their breeding sites and only a small proportion, mainly juveniles, [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] to new habitats. A dispersal distance of {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} has been observed, but this is considered uncommon. Over short distances, the newts use mainly their smell for [[animal navigation|navigation]], while over long distances, orientation by the night sky, and potentially through [[magnetoreception]] are more important.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=122-128}} \n\n===Aquatic phase and breeding===\n\nThe aquatic phase starts as soon as ice starts to disappear, from February in the lowlands to June at higher altitudes, while egg-laying follows a few months later and can continue until August.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=87-90}} Some southern populations in Greece and Italy appear to stay aquatic most of the year and hibernate under water.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=104-105}} Two rounds of breeding and egg-laying, in autumn and spring, have been observed in the Apennine subspecies, ''I. a. apuana''.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=96}}\n\n[[File:Love-Is-Blind-Indiscriminate-Female-Mating-Responses-to-Male-Courtship-Pheromones-in-Newts-pone.0056538.s001.ogv | thumb | right | Stages of [[courtship display]], filmed in captivity{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}]]\n\nBreeding behaviour occurs mainly in the morning and at dawn. Males perform a [[courtship display]], which differs somewhat from other newt species. The male first places himself in front of the female, remains static for a while and, fans his tail to stimulate the female and wave [[pheromones]] towards her. After leaning in and touching her snout, he creeps away, followed by the female. When she touches the base of his tail with her snout, he releases a sperm packet ([[spermatophore]]) and blocks the female's path so she picks it up with her cloaca. Several rounds of spermatophore deposition may follow. Males frequently interfere with displays of rivals.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}} Experiments suggested that it is mainly male pheromones that trigger mating behaviour in females while colour and other visual cues are less relevant.{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}} In a breeding season, a male can produce more than 48 spermatophores, and offspring from one female has usually several fathers.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=83-86}}\n\nFemales wrap their eggs in leaves of water plants for protection, preferring leaves closer to the surface where temperatures are higher. Where no plants are available, they may also use leaf litter, dead wood or stones for egg deposition.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=94-104}} They lay 70\u2013390 eggs in a season, which are light grey-brown and 1.5\u20131.7 mm in diameter (2.5\u20133 mm including the jelly capsule). Incubation time is longer under cold conditions, but larvae typically hatch after two to four weeks.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}} The larvae are [[benthic]], staying in general close to the bottom of the water body.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=98}} [[Metamorphosis]] occurs after around three months, again depending on temperature, but some larvae overwinter and metamorphose only in the next year.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}}\n\n===Paedomorphy===\n\n[[File:Mesotriton alpestris apuanus04.jpg | thumb | right | Paedomorphic adult (above) and larva (below) of subspecies ''I. a. apuana'']]\n\n[[Paedomorphy]] (or neoteny), where adults do not metamorphose and instead retain their [[gill]]s and stay aquatic, is more common in the alpine newt than in other European newts. It is almost exclusively found in the southern part of the range (but not in the Cantabrian subspecies, ''I. a. cyreni''). Paedomorphic adults are more pale in colour than metamorphic ones. Only part of the population is usually paedomorphic, and metamorphosis can follow if the pool dries out. Paedomorphic and metamorphic newts sometimes prefer different prey, but they do interbreed. Overall, paedomorphy appears to be a facultative strategy under particular conditions which are not fully understood.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=60-65}}\n\n===Diet, predators and parasites===\n\nAlpine newts are diet generalists, taking mainly different [[invertebrates]] as prey. Larvae and adults living in the water eat various [[plankton]], larvae of insects such as [[chironomids]], crustaceans such as [[ostracods]] or [[amphipods]], and terrestrial insects falling on the surface. Amphibian eggs and larvae, including the same species, are also eaten. Prey on land includes various insects, worms, spiders or [[isopods]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=68-72}}\n\n[[Predator]]s taking adult alpine newts are snakes such as the [[grass snake]], fish such as [[trout]], birds such as [[heron]]s or [[duck]]s, and mammals such as [[hedgehogs]], [[marten]]s or [[shrew]]s. Under water, large diving beetles (''[[Dytiscus]]'') can kill newts, while small juveniles on land may be predated by ground beetles (''[[Carabus]]''). For eggs and larvae, diving beetles, fish, [[dragonfly]] larvae, and other newts are the main enemies.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=73-77}}\n\nThreatened adult newts often take on a defence position, where they expose the [[aposematism|warning colour]] of their belly by bending backwards or raising their tail. They also sometimes emit sounds, whose function is however unknown.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=74-75}}\n\nParasites include [[parasitic worm]]s, [[leeches]], the ciliate ''[[Balantidium elongatum]]'', and potentially [[Lucilia bufonivora|toadflies]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=77}} A [[ranavirus]] transmitted to alpine newts from [[midwife toad]]s in Spain caused bleeding and [[necrosis]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=142}} The [[chytridiomycosis]]-causing fungus ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'' has been found in wild populations,<ref name=\"ZampigliaCanestrelli2013\"/> and the emerging ''[[Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans|B. salamandrivorans]]'' was lethal for alpine newts in laboratory experiments.<ref name=\"MartelBlooi2014\"/>\n\n==Evolution==\n\nAlpine newt [[population]]s have separated since the [[Early Miocene]], around 20 [[million years ago]], according to a [[molecular phylogenetic]] estimate.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Fossil remains of the alpine newt were found in the [[Pleistocene]] of Northern Italy.{{r|VillaBlain2018}} An older, [[Miocene]] fossil from Germany, ''[[Ichthyosaura randeckensis]]'', may be its [[sister species]].{{r|Schoch2013}}\n\nAnalyses showed that populations fall into a western and an eastern group. Each of these again contains two major [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]], which only in part correspond to described [[subspecies]] (see below).{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|SotiropoulosEleftherakos2007}} These genetic differences suggest that the alpine newt may be a [[species complex|complex]] of several distinct species.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} Higher temperatures during the [[Miocene]] or sea level oscillations may have separated early populations, leading to [[allopatric speciation]]. However, [[nuclear DNA|nuclear]] and [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial DNA]] show different population structures, which may results from [[genetic admixture|admixture]] and [[introgression]] between lineages. The [[Quaternary glaciation]] probably led to cycles of population retreat, expansion and range shifts.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}}\n\n==Threats and conservation==\n\nBecause of its overall large range and populations that are not severely fragmented, the alpine newt is classified as [[Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]]; the population trend however is \"Decreasing\".{{r|iucn}} Threats are similar to those affecting other newts and include mainly [[habitat destruction|destruction]] and [[water pollution|pollution]] of aquatic habitats, as well as the introduction of fish, especially [[salmonids]], to breeding sites.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}} In the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] [[karst]] region, populations have declined as ponds created for cattle and human use were abandoned over the last decades.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\nIntroduced alpine newts may themselves pose a threat to native amphibians if they carry disease. At least one introduced population in the United Kingdom was affected by [[chytridiomycosis]],{{r|iucn}} and for the exotic subspecies ''I. a. apuana'' in New Zealand, [[eradication]] was recommended.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist | 30em | refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bell2016\">{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=B.D. | title = A review of potential alpine newt (''Ichthyosaura alpestris'') impacts on native frogs in New Zealand | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand | volume = 46 | issue=3\u20134 | year = 2016 | pages = 214\u2013231 | issn=0303-6758 | doi = 10.1080/03036758.2016.1216455}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bolkay1928\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bolkay | first1 = J. | title = Die Sch\u00e4del der Salamandrinen, mit besonderer R\u00fccksicht auf ihre systematische Bedeutung | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte | volume = 86 | issue = 3-4 | year = 1928 | pages = 259\u2013319 | issn = 0340-2061 |doi = 10.1007/BF02117989 | language = German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BondNHSN\">{{cite url | last1 = Bond | first1 = I. | title = Alpine Newt | year = 2020 | publisher = Natural History Society of Northumbria | url = https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ | accessdate = 5 April 2020 | archiveurl = | archive-date = 22 September 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190922004603/https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Frost2020\">{{ cite web |last=Frost |first=D.R. | year = 2020 | title = ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' (Laurenti, 1768).

The tail is half as long or slightly shorter than the rest of the body and laterally compressed. During life in water, both sexes develop a tail [[fin]], and males a low, smooth-edged crest on the back. The [[cloaca]] of males swells during breeding season. The skin is smooth during and granular outside breeding season, and velvety during the land phase.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\nAlpine newts are blackish\u2013grey to bluish on the sides and the back, while their belly is an unspotted orange. Males also have a white band with black spots and a light blue flash running along the flanks, from the cheeks to the tail. Their crest, during breeding season, is white with regular dark spots. Females are of a more drab, mottled colour than males. Body shape and colour differ slightly among the subspecies.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\n[[Larvae]] are 7\u20138 mm long after hatching and grow to {{convert|4-5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. They are usually light brown-yellow and darker towards the tail, which ends in a small, pointed filament.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\nThe alpine newt was first described in 1768, as ''Triton alpestris'' from mount [[\u00d6tscher]] in the Austrian Alps (''alpestris'' meaning \"alpine\" in Latin), by Austrian zoologist [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]].{{r|Laurenti1768}} Laurenti thought that males, females and larvae were different species.{{r|Schmidtler2007}} Later, the alpine newt was placed in ''[[Triturus]]'' along with most other European newts. As this genus was found to contain several unrelated lineages, the alpine newt was split off as [[monotypic]] genus ''Mesotriton'' in 2004,{{r|Garcia-Paris2004}} which had been erected as a [[subgenus]] by [[Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef Bolkay]] in 1928.{{r|Bolkay1928}} However, it was argued that a gilled newt Laurenti had described as ''Proteus tritonius'' in fact represented a larva of the alpine newt. The name ''Ichthyosaura'', introduced by [[Sonnini de Manoncourt]] and [[Latreille]] in 1801 for that larva,{{r|SonniniLatreille1802|p=310}} therefore has priority over ''Mesotriton'' and is the [[valid name (zoology)|valid]] genus name.{{r|1=Schmidtler2009|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=9-10}}\n\n==Distribution and subspecies==\n\nThe alpine newt is native to continental Europe. It is relatively common over a large, more or less continuous range from northwestern France to the [[Carpathians]] in Romania, and from southern Denmark in the north to the [[Alps]] and France just north of the Mediterranean in the south, but absent from the [[Pannonian basin]]. Isolated areas of dsitribution exist in Spain, Italy and Greece.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214\u2013215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=39-46|3=RecueroBuckley2014|4=Raffaelli2018}} Populations have been deliberately [[Introduced species|introduced]] to various places in continental Europe, including within the boundaries of cities such as [[Bremen]] and [[Berlin]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=39-46}} More distant introductions have occurred to [[Great Britain]], mainly England but also Scotland,{{r|BondNHSN}} and New Zealand.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\nA number of geographic [[subspecies]] have been described, but many were not recognised by later authors. Differences in shape and colour are not consistent.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} The ''Handbook of the Amphibians and Reptiles of Europe'' (2003),{{r|Rocek2003}} followed by later authors,{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} recognised four subspecies (see table below). [[Molecular phylogenetics]] confirmed five distinct lineages, which correspond only in part to these subspecies: The western populations of the [[nominate subspecies]] ''I. a. alpestris'', together with the [[Cantabrian]] ''I. a. cyreni'' and the [[Apennines|Apennine]] ''I. a. apuana'' form one group, while the eastern populations are genetically closer to the Greek ''I. a. veluchiensis''.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Several authors argued that these ancient lineages might even represent [[cryptic species]].{{r|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} An article from 2018 accepted four species,{{r|Raffaelli2018}} but this has been considered premature in ''Amphibian Species of the World''.{{r|Frost2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n! colspan=2; style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Subspecies{{r|1=Rocek2003|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=214|3=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=16-36}} !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Distribution !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Alternative classification{{r|Raffaelli2018}}\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| rowspan=2 | ''I. a. alpestris'' {{small|Laurenti, 1768}}<br>\u2013 Alpine newt || western populations || Northwestern France to northern [[Carpathians]] in Romania; southern Denmark in the north; Alps and France north of the Mediterranean in the south || Subspecies ''I. alpestris alpestris''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| eastern populations || [[Balkan peninsula]] north of Greece to Bulgaria and southern Carpathians in Romania || Species ''I. reiseri'', with subspecies ''reiseri'', ''carpathica'' and ''montenegrina''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. apuana'' {{small|Gray, 1850}}<br>\u2013 Apennine alpine newt || Extreme southeastern France, Apennines to [[Lazio]] in central Italy, isolated populations in [[Calabria]] || Species ''I. apuana'', with subspecies ''apuana'' and ''inexpectata'' (Calabria)\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. cyreni'' {{small|Mertens & Muller, 1940}}<br>\u2013 Cantabrian alpine newt || Spain: Cantabrian mountains and [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] (introduced) || Subspecies ''I. alpestris cyreni''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. veluchiensis'' {{small|Wolterstorff, 1935}}<br>\u2013 Greek alpine newt || Greece: mainland and northern [[Peloponnese]] || Species ''I. veluchiensis''\n\n|}\n\n==Habitats==\n\nThe alpine newt can occur at high elevation and has been found up to {{convert|2370|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]] in the Alps. However, it does occur in the lowlands down to sea level. Towards the south of its range, most populations are found above {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=51-59}}\n\nForests, including both [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests (but avoiding pure [[Picea abies|spruce]] plantations), are the main land habitat. Less common are forest edges, [[brownfield land]], or gardens. Populations can be found above [[tree line]] in the high mountains, where they prefer south-exposed slopes. The newts use logs, stones, leaf litter, [[burrow]]s, [[construction waste]] or similar structures as hiding places.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=54-59}}\n\nAquatic breeding sites close to suitable land habitat are critical. While small, cool water bodies in forested areas are preferred, alpine newts tolerate a wide range of permanent or [[vernal pool|non-permanent]], natural or human-made water bodies. These can range from shallow puddles over small ponds to larger, fish-free lakes or reservoirs and quiet parts of streams. Damming by [[Eurasian beaver|beavers]] creates valuable breeding sites. Overall, the alpine newt is tolerant regarding chemical parameters such as [[pH]], [[water hardness]] and [[eutrophication]]. Other European newts such as the [[Northern crested newt|crested]], [[Smooth newt|smooth]], [[Palmate newt|palmate]] or [[Carpathian newt]] often use the same breeding sites, but are less common at higher elevation.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=47-54}}\n\n==Life and behaviour==\n\nAlpine newts are usually [[semiaquatic]], spending most of the year (9-10 months) on land and only returning to the water for breeding. The juvenile [[eft]]s are probably terrestrial throughout the year.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=54}} They reach [[sexual maturity]] at around three years in males, and four to five years in females, and can reach an age of ten years in lowland. At higher altitude, maturity is reached only after 9-11 years, and the newts can grow up to 30 years old.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n===Terrestrial phase===\n\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg | thumb | right | Juvenile hibernating in dead wood]]\n\nOn land, alpine newts are mainly nocturnal, hiding most of the day and moving and feeding during the night or in the [[twighlight]]. They have been observed to climb up to {{convert|2|m|ft}} high vertical walls on wet nights. [[Hibernation]] also usually takes place in hiding places on land.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=105-107}} Migration to breeding sites occurs on sufficiently warm (above 5 \u00b0C) and humid nights and may be delayed or interrupted for several weeks in unfavourable conditions. The newts can also leave the water again in case of a sudden cold snap.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=89-90}}\n\nAlpine newts tend to stay close to their breeding sites and only a small proportion, mainly juveniles, [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] to new habitats. A dispersal distance of {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} has been observed, but this is considered uncommon. Over short distances, the newts use mainly their smell for [[animal navigation|navigation]], while over long distances, orientation by the night sky, and potentially through [[magnetoreception]] are more important.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=122-128}} \n\n===Aquatic phase and breeding===\n\nThe aquatic phase starts as soon as ice starts to disappear, from February in the lowlands to June at higher altitudes, while egg-laying follows a few months later and can continue until August.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=87-90}} Some southern populations in Greece and Italy appear to stay aquatic most of the year and hibernate under water.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=104-105}} Two rounds of breeding and egg-laying, in autumn and spring, have been observed in the Apennine subspecies, ''I. a. apuana''.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=96}}\n\n[[File:Love-Is-Blind-Indiscriminate-Female-Mating-Responses-to-Male-Courtship-Pheromones-in-Newts-pone.0056538.s001.ogv | thumb | right | Stages of [[courtship display]], filmed in captivity{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}]]\n\nBreeding behaviour occurs mainly in the morning and at dawn. Males perform a [[courtship display]], which differs somewhat from other newt species. The male first places himself in front of the female, remains static for a while and, fans his tail to stimulate the female and wave [[pheromones]] towards her. After leaning in and touching her snout, he creeps away, followed by the female. When she touches the base of his tail with her snout, he releases a sperm packet ([[spermatophore]]) and blocks the female's path so she picks it up with her cloaca. Several rounds of spermatophore deposition may follow. Males frequently interfere with displays of rivals.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}} Experiments suggested that it is mainly male pheromones that trigger mating behaviour in females while colour and other visual cues are less relevant.{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}} In a breeding season, a male can produce more than 48 spermatophores, and offspring from one female has usually several fathers.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=83-86}}\n\nFemales wrap their eggs in leaves of water plants for protection, preferring leaves closer to the surface where temperatures are higher. Where no plants are available, they may also use leaf litter, dead wood or stones for egg deposition.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=94-104}} They lay 70\u2013390 eggs in a season, which are light grey-brown and 1.5\u20131.7 mm in diameter (2.5\u20133 mm including the jelly capsule). Incubation time is longer under cold conditions, but larvae typically hatch after two to four weeks.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}} The larvae are [[benthic]], staying in general close to the bottom of the water body.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=98}} [[Metamorphosis]] occurs after around three months, again depending on temperature, but some larvae overwinter and metamorphose only in the next year.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}}\n\n===Paedomorphy===\n\n[[File:Mesotriton alpestris apuanus04.jpg | thumb | right | Paedomorphic adult (above) and larva (below) of subspecies ''I. a. apuana'']]\n\n[[Paedomorphy]] (or neoteny), where adults do not metamorphose and instead retain their [[gill]]s and stay aquatic, is more common in the alpine newt than in other European newts. It is almost exclusively found in the southern part of the range (but not in the Cantabrian subspecies, ''I. a. cyreni''). Paedomorphic adults are more pale in colour than metamorphic ones. Only part of the population is usually paedomorphic, and metamorphosis can follow if the pool dries out. Paedomorphic and metamorphic newts sometimes prefer different prey, but they do interbreed. Overall, paedomorphy appears to be a facultative strategy under particular conditions which are not fully understood.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=60-65}}\n\n===Diet, predators and parasites===\n\nAlpine newts are diet generalists, taking mainly different [[invertebrates]] as prey. Larvae and adults living in the water eat various [[plankton]], larvae of insects such as [[chironomids]], crustaceans such as [[ostracods]] or [[amphipods]], and terrestrial insects falling on the surface. Amphibian eggs and larvae, including the same species, are also eaten. Prey on land includes various insects, worms, spiders or [[isopods]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=68-72}}\n\n[[Predator]]s taking adult alpine newts are snakes such as the [[grass snake]], fish such as [[trout]], birds such as [[heron]]s or [[duck]]s, and mammals such as [[hedgehogs]], [[marten]]s or [[shrew]]s. Under water, large diving beetles (''[[Dytiscus]]'') can kill newts, while small juveniles on land may be predated by ground beetles (''[[Carabus]]''). For eggs and larvae, diving beetles, fish, [[dragonfly]] larvae, and other newts are the main enemies.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=73-77}}\n\nThreatened adult newts often take on a defence position, where they expose the [[aposematism|warning colour]] of their belly by bending backwards or raising their tail. They also sometimes emit sounds, whose function is however unknown.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=74-75}}\n\nParasites include [[parasitic worm]]s, [[leeches]], the ciliate ''[[Balantidium elongatum]]'', and potentially [[Lucilia bufonivora|toadflies]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=77}} A [[ranavirus]] transmitted to alpine newts from [[midwife toad]]s in Spain caused bleeding and [[necrosis]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=142}} The [[chytridiomycosis]]-causing fungus ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'' has been found in wild populations,<ref name=\"ZampigliaCanestrelli2013\"/> and the emerging ''[[Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans|B. salamandrivorans]]'' was lethal for alpine newts in laboratory experiments.<ref name=\"MartelBlooi2014\"/>\n\n==Evolution==\n\nAlpine newt [[population]]s have separated since the [[Early Miocene]], around 20 [[million years ago]], according to a [[molecular phylogenetic]] estimate.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Fossil remains of the alpine newt were found in the [[Pleistocene]] of Northern Italy.{{r|VillaBlain2018}} An older, [[Miocene]] fossil from Germany, ''[[Ichthyosaura randeckensis]]'', may be its [[sister species]].{{r|Schoch2013}}\n\nAnalyses showed that populations fall into a western and an eastern group. Each of these again contains two major [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]], which only in part correspond to described [[subspecies]] (see below).{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|SotiropoulosEleftherakos2007}} These genetic differences suggest that the alpine newt may be a [[species complex|complex]] of several distinct species.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} Higher temperatures during the [[Miocene]] or sea level oscillations may have separated early populations, leading to [[allopatric speciation]]. However, [[nuclear DNA|nuclear]] and [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial DNA]] show different population structures, which may results from [[genetic admixture|admixture]] and [[introgression]] between lineages. The [[Quaternary glaciation]] probably led to cycles of population retreat, expansion and range shifts.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}}\n\n==Threats and conservation==\n\nBecause of its overall large range and populations that are not severely fragmented, the alpine newt is classified as [[Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]]; the population trend however is \"Decreasing\".{{r|iucn}} Threats are similar to those affecting other newts and include mainly [[habitat destruction|destruction]] and [[water pollution|pollution]] of aquatic habitats, as well as the introduction of fish, especially [[salmonids]], to breeding sites.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}} In the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] [[karst]] region, populations have declined as ponds created for cattle and human use were abandoned over the last decades.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\nIntroduced alpine newts may themselves pose a threat to native amphibians if they carry disease. At least one introduced population in the United Kingdom was affected by [[chytridiomycosis]],{{r|iucn}} and for the exotic subspecies ''I. a. apuana'' in New Zealand, [[eradication]] was recommended.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist | 30em | refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bell2016\">{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=B.D. | title = A review of potential alpine newt (''Ichthyosaura alpestris'') impacts on native frogs in New Zealand | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand | volume = 46 | issue=3\u20134 | year = 2016 | pages = 214\u2013231 | issn=0303-6758 | doi = 10.1080/03036758.2016.1216455}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bolkay1928\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bolkay | first1 = J. | title = Die Sch\u00e4del der Salamandrinen, mit besonderer R\u00fccksicht auf ihre systematische Bedeutung | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte | volume = 86 | issue = 3-4 | year = 1928 | pages = 259\u2013319 | issn = 0340-2061 |doi = 10.1007/BF02117989 | language = German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BondNHSN\">{{cite url | last1 = Bond | first1 = I. | title = Alpine Newt | year = 2020 | publisher = Natural History Society of Northumbria | url = https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ | accessdate = 5 April 2020 | archiveurl = | archive-date = 22 September 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190922004603/https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Frost2020\">{{ cite web |last=Frost |first=D.R. | year = 2020 | title = ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' (Laurenti, 1768).

Hamburg was briefly annexed by [[Napoleon I]] to the [[First French Empire]], however, Russian forces under [[Levin August, Count von Bennigsen|General Bennigsen]] freed the city in 1814. Hamburg re-assumed its pre-1811 status as a city-state in 1814 when Rumpff returned to his hometown. He joined the diplomatic service and served as [[attach\u00e9]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]] which confirmed Hamburg's independence and it became one of 39 sovereign states of the [[German Confederation]].\n\nIn 1815, he was sent to [[Frankfurt]] as legation secretary of the Hamburg embassy to the [[Federal Convention (German Confederation)|Bundestag]]. In 1819, he acquired Hamburg citizenship. Hamburg entrusted him with the newly founded Hanseatic embassy at the [[Emperor of Austria#The Imperial Court|Imperial Court in Vienna]], and appointed him Minister.\n\nIn 1824, he took over the post of Minister at the French court in Paris and was a representative of the [[Hanseatic cities|Hanseatic]] merchants in Paris.<ref name=\"Emmerich2013\">{{cite book |last1=Emmerich |first1=Alexander |title=John Jacob Astor and the First Great American Fortune |date=2013 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-1-4766-0382-7 |page=112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQ43AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112 |accessdate=24 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>  The other three free cities of [[Bremen]], Frankfurt and [[L\u00fcbeck]] also delegated their diplomatic representation to him.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established during the [[heptarchy]], as an administrative and defensive unit in 918.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> Its purpose was to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]], and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation. A second report known as the ''West Midlands General Review'' looked into the administrative authorities within the wider [[West Midlands (region)|region]], including the remainder of Worcestershire.<ref>Local Government Commission for England: Report No 2. West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 7: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.

The county of Hereford & Worcester was to be reviewed again, despite an earlier structural review which recommended no change to the county.\n\nVarious options were put to consultation, including:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

''Preference of Malvern Hills District Council and supported by Leominster District Council.''\n|-\n| '''Hybrid''' || A unitary Herefordshire and two tier Worcestershire, based on pre-1974 boundaries (excluding Stourbridge & Halesowen).

''This was put forward by the commission as an alternative structure to the final recommendation''\n|}\n\nOther ideas put forward and discounted before the consultation stage included a complete restoration of the pre-1974 Worcestershire county boundary. This option included Stourbridge and Halesowen, as they were under the jurisdiction of Worcestershire County Council until 1 April 1974.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established during the [[heptarchy]], as an administrative and defensive unit in 918.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> Its purpose was to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]], and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation. A second report known as the ''West Midlands General Review'' looked into the administrative authorities within the wider [[West Midlands (region)|region]], including the remainder of Worcestershire.<ref>Local Government Commission for England: Report No 2. West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 7: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.

These men were sent, ostensibly, to set up [[coconut]] farming in Kerala. Another version of the story says that the Sri Lankan king sent eight martial families to Kerala at the request of a Chera king to quell a civil war that had erupted in Kerala against him.<ref name=\"ezh9\"/>{{clarify|reason=please can we see a translation of the relevant content on the talk page&nbsp;\u2014 thanks.|date=October 2011}}\n\n===Social and religious divergence===\nIt has been suggested that the Ezhavas may share a common heritage with the [[Nair]] caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the [[Zamorin]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the rulers of the [[Cochin dynasty]]. [[Cyriac Pullapilly]] has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nA theory has been proposed for the origins of the [[Caste system in Kerala|caste system in the Kerala region]] based on the actions of the Aryan [[Jain]]s introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited sympathetic local people to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they \"... were given ''kshatriya'' functions, but only ''shudra'' status. Thus originated the Nairs.\" The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nAn alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st-century AD, there was a large influx from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nThe Buddhist tradition of the Ezhavas, and the refusal to give it up, pushed them to an outcaste role within the greater Brahminic society.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/><ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=A6MfPh-9DiEC&pg=PA25#PPA18,M1 | page = 18 | title = On life and times of George Joseph, 1887\u20131938, a Syrian Christian nationalist from Kerala | author = Joseph, George Gheverghese | publisher = Orient Longman | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-12-09 | isbn=978-81-250-2495-8}}</ref> This tradition is still evident as Ezhavas show greater interest in the moral, non-ritualistic, and non-dogmatic aspects of the religion rather than the theological.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\n==Past occupations==\nThe social anthropologists Filippo and Caroline Osella say that the Ezhavas \"...&nbsp;consisted in the mid-nineteenth century of a small landowning and titled elite and a large mass of landless and small tenants who were largely illiterate, considered untouchable, and who eked out a living by manual labour and petty trade.\"<ref name=\"Osella8\">{{cite book |title=Social Mobility in Kerala: Modernity and Identity in Conflict |first1=Filippo |last1=Osella |first2=Caroline |last2=Osella |publisher=Pluto Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7453-1693-2 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rMRw0gTZSJwC&pg=PA8}}</ref>{{efn|Gough describes Thiyya subtenants in Central Travancore, who worked land held by the Nair caste.

This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as ''toddy tapping'', toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of [[coir]] products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> The coastal town of [[Alleppey]] became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after [[World War I]] led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas. The [[Great Depression]] impacted in particular on the export trade, causing a reduction in price and in wages even though production increased, with the consequence that during the 1930s many Ezhava families found themselves to be in dire financial circumstances.<ref name=\"Osella50\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Communal Road to a Secular Kerala |first=George |last=Mathew |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=1989 |isbn=978-81-7022-282-8 |pages=137\u2013138 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1TuPeXFP0WgC&pg=PA137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title='Destroy Capitalism!': Growing Solidarity of Alleppey's Coir Workers, 1930\u201340 |first=Robin |last=Jeffrey |authorlink=Robin Jeffrey |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=19 |issue=29 |pages=1159\u20131165 |date=21 July 1984 |jstor=4373437}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nSome Ezhavas were involved in weaving and ship making.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bVgeAAAAMAAJ&dq=jaggery+izhava&q=jaggery|title= Religion and ideology in Kerala |page=246|first=Genevi\u00e8ve |last=Lemercinier|publisher=D.K.

This is also known as Pandavarkali, which means the play of the Pandavas, (the five heroes of the ''[[Mahabharatha]]''), and is performed by Asari, Moosari, Karuvan, Thattan and Kallasari communities. This ritualistic dance is performed beneath a decorated pandal with a [[nilavilakku]] at its centre.

Arjuna nritham is also called \"Mayilpeeli Thookkam\" as the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli ([[peacock]] feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the \"uduthukettu\" of [[Kathakali]]. The various dance movements are closely similar to [[Kalarippayattu]] techniques.

In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twin around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times. [[Sandalwood]] paste on the forehead, a red towel round the head, red silk around the waist and bells round the ankles form the costume.

Those living in southern [[Travancore]] tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\nThese arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the [[Nair]]s, another [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste]] in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called ''[[tharavadu|taravadu]]'' and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\n===Thiyyar Marriage===\n\n[[Edgar Thurston]] has described Thiyyar wedding in his [[Castes and Tribes of Southern India]] as\n\n\"The South Malabar Tiyan bridegroom, dressed as if for a wrestling match, with his cloth tied tight about his loins, carries a sword and shield, and is escorted by two companions similarly equipped, dancing their way along. The Izhuvan does not carry a sword under any circumstances. The chief feature of his wedding ceremony is a singing match. This, called the vatil-tura-pattu, or open the door song, assumes the form of a contest between the parties of the bridegroom and bride. The story of Krishna and his wife Rukmini is supposed to be alluded to. We have seen it all under slightly different colour at Conjeeveram. Krishna asks Rukmini to open the door, and admit him. She refuses, thinking he has been gallivanting with some other lady. He beseeches ; she refuses. He explains, and at length she yields. The song is more or less extem- pore, and each \"side must be ready with an immediate answer. The side which is reduced to the extremity of having no answer is beaten and under ignominy. Marriage is strictly forbidden between two persons belonging to the same illam. The bride and bridegroom must belong to different illams. In fact, the illams are exogamous. The following formula is repeated by the headman of the bride's party. Translated as accurately as possible, it runs thus. \"The tara and changati of both sides having met and consulted ; the astrologer having fixed an auspicious day after examining the star and porutham ; permission having been obtained from the tara, the relations, the illam and kulam, the father, uncle, and the brothers, and from the eight and four (twelve illams) and the six and four (ten kiriyams) ; the conji and adayalam ceremonies and the four tazhus having been performed, let me perform the kanjikudi ceremony for the marriage of ....

This was named after [[Narayana Guru]], who had established an ''[[ashram]]'' from where he preached his message of \"one caste, one religion, one god\" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\" /> One of the initial aims of the SNDP was to campaign for the removal of the restrictions on school entry but even after those legal barriers to education were removed, it was uncommon in practice for Ezhavas to be admitted to government schools. Thus, the campaign shifted to providing schools operated by the community itself.<ref name=\"Padmanabhan\" /> The organisation, attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful.

The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924\u20131925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of ''[[avarna]]'' access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], orchestrated by [[T.

Membership had reached 50,000 by 1928 and 60,000 by 1974, but Nossiter notes that, \"From the Vaikom ''satyagraha'' onwards the SNDP had stirred the ordinary Ezhava without materially improving his position.\" The division in the 1920s of 60,000 acres of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than 1 acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalization and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on the coir industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the [[Nair Service Society]] (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/>\n\n==Position in society==\nThey were considered as ''avarna'' (outside brahmanical varna system) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> [[Kathleen Gough]] says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the \"higher polluting castes\", a group whose other constituents included [[Kanisan]]s and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the \"lower polluting castes\", such as the [[Pulayar]]s and [[Paraiyar]]s.

These men were sent, ostensibly, to set up [[coconut]] farming in Kerala. Another version of the story says that the Sri Lankan king sent eight martial families to Kerala at the request of a Chera king to quell a civil war that had erupted in Kerala against him.<ref name=\"ezh9\"/>{{clarify|reason=please can we see a translation of the relevant content on the talk page&nbsp;\u2014 thanks.|date=October 2011}}\n\n===Social and religious divergence===\nIt has been suggested that the Ezhavas may share a common heritage with the [[Nair]] caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the [[Zamorin]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the rulers of the [[Cochin dynasty]]. [[Cyriac Pullapilly]] has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nA theory has been proposed for the origins of the [[Caste system in Kerala|caste system in the Kerala region]] based on the actions of the Aryan [[Jain]]s introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited sympathetic local people to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they \"... were given ''kshatriya'' functions, but only ''shudra'' status. Thus originated the Nairs.\" The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nAn alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st-century AD, there was a large influx from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes.

This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as ''toddy tapping'', toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of [[coir]] products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> The coastal town of [[Alleppey]] became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after [[World War I]] led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas. The [[Great Depression]] impacted in particular on the export trade, causing a reduction in price and in wages even though production increased, with the consequence that during the 1930s many Ezhava families found themselves to be in dire financial circumstances.<ref name=\"Osella50\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Communal Road to a Secular Kerala |first=George |last=Mathew |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=1989 |isbn=978-81-7022-282-8 |pages=137\u2013138 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1TuPeXFP0WgC&pg=PA137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title='Destroy Capitalism!': Growing Solidarity of Alleppey's Coir Workers, 1930\u201340 |first=Robin |last=Jeffrey |authorlink=Robin Jeffrey |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=19 |issue=29 |pages=1159\u20131165 |date=21 July 1984 |jstor=4373437}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nSome Ezhavas were involved in weaving and ship making.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bVgeAAAAMAAJ&dq=jaggery+izhava&q=jaggery|title= Religion and ideology in Kerala |page=246|first=Genevi\u00e8ve |last=Lemercinier|publisher=D.K.

This was a ritualistic art form performed in almost all important temples of Kerala.  Today it is found in central Kerala.  This is also known as Pandavarkali, which means the play of the Pandavas, (the five heroes of the ''[[Mahabharatha]]''), and is performed by Asari, Moosari, Karuvan, Thattan and Kallasari communities. This ritualistic dance is performed beneath a decorated pandal with a [[nilavilakku]] at its centre.

Arjuna nritham is also called \"Mayilpeeli Thookkam\" as the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli ([[peacock]] feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the \"uduthukettu\" of [[Kathakali]]. The various dance movements are closely similar to [[Kalarippayattu]] techniques. The performers have their faces painted green and wear distinctive headgears.  The all night performance of the dance form is usually presented solo or in pairs.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Makachuttu===\nMakachuttu art is popular among Ezhavas in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and Chirayinkizhu taluks and in [[Kilimanoor]], Pazhayakunnummal and Thattathumala regions. In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twin around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times. [[Sandalwood]] paste on the forehead, a red towel round the head, red silk around the waist and bells round the ankles form the costume.

Those living in southern [[Travancore]] tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\nThese arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the [[Nair]]s, another [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste]] in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called ''[[tharavadu|taravadu]]'' and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\n===Thiyyar Marriage===\n\n[[Edgar Thurston]] has described Thiyyar wedding in his [[Castes and Tribes of Southern India]] as\n\n\"The South Malabar Tiyan bridegroom, dressed as if for a wrestling match, with his cloth tied tight about his loins, carries a sword and shield, and is escorted by two companions similarly equipped, dancing their way along. The Izhuvan does not carry a sword under any circumstances. The chief feature of his wedding ceremony is a singing match. This, called the vatil-tura-pattu, or open the door song, assumes the form of a contest between the parties of the bridegroom and bride. The story of Krishna and his wife Rukmini is supposed to be alluded to. We have seen it all under slightly different colour at Conjeeveram. Krishna asks Rukmini to open the door, and admit him. She refuses, thinking he has been gallivanting with some other lady. He beseeches ; she refuses. He explains, and at length she yields. The song is more or less extem- pore, and each \"side must be ready with an immediate answer. The side which is reduced to the extremity of having no answer is beaten and under ignominy. Marriage is strictly forbidden between two persons belonging to the same illam. The bride and bridegroom must belong to different illams. In fact, the illams are exogamous. The following formula is repeated by the headman of the bride's party. Translated as accurately as possible, it runs thus. \"The tara and changati of both sides having met and consulted ; the astrologer having fixed an auspicious day after examining the star and porutham ; permission having been obtained from the tara, the relations, the illam and kulam, the father, uncle, and the brothers, and from the eight and four (twelve illams) and the six and four (ten kiriyams) ; the conji and adayalam ceremonies and the four tazhus having been performed, let me perform the kanjikudi ceremony for the marriage of ....

This was named after [[Narayana Guru]], who had established an ''[[ashram]]'' from where he preached his message of \"one caste, one religion, one god\" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\" /> One of the initial aims of the SNDP was to campaign for the removal of the restrictions on school entry but even after those legal barriers to education were removed, it was uncommon in practice for Ezhavas to be admitted to government schools. Thus, the campaign shifted to providing schools operated by the community itself.<ref name=\"Padmanabhan\" /> The organisation, attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful.

The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924\u20131925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of ''[[avarna]]'' access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], orchestrated by [[T. K. Madhavan]], a revolutionary and civil rights activist,<ref name=\"Smith1976p38\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] p. 38</ref> and with a famous temple at [[Vaikom]] as the focal point. Although it failed in its stated aim of achieving access, the [[satyagraha]] (movement) did succeed in voicing a \"radical rhetoric\", according to Nossiter.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/> During this movement, a few [[Khalsa|Akalis]]\u2014an order of armed [[Sikh]]s\u2014came to Vaikom in support of the demonstrators. After the eventual passing of the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], some of the Akalis remained. They attracted some Ezhava youth to the concepts of the Sikhism, resulting in Ezhava conversions to Sikhism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C8EBAAAAMAAJ&q=sikhism+ezhava&dq=sikhism+ezhava|title= The abstention movement|page=19|first=K.K |last=Kusuman|publisher=Kerala Historical Society |year=1976|accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the SNDP in improving the lot of Ezhavas has been questioned. Membership had reached 50,000 by 1928 and 60,000 by 1974, but Nossiter notes that, \"From the Vaikom ''satyagraha'' onwards the SNDP had stirred the ordinary Ezhava without materially improving his position.\" The division in the 1920s of 60,000 acres of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than 1 acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalization and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on the coir industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the [[Nair Service Society]] (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/>\n\n==Position in society==\nThey were considered as ''avarna'' (outside brahmanical varna system) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> [[Kathleen Gough]] says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the \"higher polluting castes\", a group whose other constituents included [[Kanisan]]s and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the \"lower polluting castes\", such as the [[Pulayar]]s and [[Paraiyar]]s.
