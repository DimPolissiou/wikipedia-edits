As such, the written name ''kurios'' took on a whole new aura of significance. [...] [Hence arose] a special way of writing the divine name ''kurios'' in Greek. The result was {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}}, a contracted form, using the first and last letters of ''kurios''. Interestingly, a transitional stage\u2014between writing YHWH and {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}}\u2014can be witnessed in [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 656]]. (Though this codex is dated to the second century AD, it probably represents earlier practice.) [...] the original scribe left a four-letter space open [...] for someone else to fill in the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew. But it was not filled in with the Tetragrammaton. Instead, the divine name was squeezed in by another scribe with the name \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2. Evidently, there was no one qualified to fill in the space with the archaic-Hebrew form, so it was filled in with the Greek surrogate.\" He then pictures a situation where the second scribe filled in the empty space not with \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 but with {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}}, and in support quotes [[Harry Y. Gamble]], who, \"following G. Howard, reconstructed a similar scenario for the creation of the nomina sacra\".{{sfn|Comfort|2005|pp=209\u2013210}}\n\nComfort adds: \"Christians (whether Jews or Gentiles) would have first used the nomina sacra in Greek Old Testament texts, and then transferred this practice to New Testament manuscripts. These Old Testament writings could have been books of the Old Testament [...] [or] collections of testimonia\u2014i.e., excerpts of Old Testament passages (with commentary) that Christians compiled as proof texts for Christian claims and that the early Christian writers used for providing quotations in their writings, such as we see in Matthew's Gospel.\" {{sfn|Comfort|2005|pp=210\u2013211}} Howard, on the other hand, supposed that the New Testament writers took their quotations directly from Septuagint manuscripts (which he also supposed to have the Hebrew tetragrammaton), not from the handier testimonia. which might already have nomina sacra.\n\nRecognizing that \"the earliest extant testimony for the nomina sacra does not come from the Testimonia but from continuous Old Testament texts\" of the early second century, Comfort states: \"Regardless of whether the nomina sacra were invented in the testimonia stage or in early Christian Greek Old Testament manuscripts (i.e., first century), the significance is that they may have existed in written form before the Gospels and Epistles were written. As such, some of the New Testament writers themselves could have adopted these forms when they wrote their books. The presence of the nomina sacra in all the earliest Christian manuscripts dating from the early second century necessitates that it was a widespread practice established much earlier. If we place the origin of that practice to the autographs and/or early publications of the New Testament writings, it explains the universal proliferation thereafter.\"{{sfn|Comfort|2005|p=211}}\n\nGeorge Howard proposes that the change to the ''nomina sacra'' {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}} and {{overline|\u03b8\u03c2}} instead of YHWH in Christian copies of the Septuagint took place \"at least by the beginning of the second century\": it began \"towards the end of the first century\", and \"somewhere around the beginning of the second century [...] must have crowded out the Tetragram in both Testaments\".<ref name=Howard2/> Already by the late second century ''nomina sacra'' were used not only in New Testament manuscripts but also in inscriptions in [[Lycaonia]] (modern central Turkey).<ref>{{cite book|title=Early Christianity in Lycaonia and Adjacent Areas: From Paul to Amphilochius of Iconium, Early Christianity in Asia Minor|author=Cilliers Breytenbach, Christiane Zimmermann|publisher=BRILL|year=2018|url=https://books.google.com.gt/books?id=ztBCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false |quote=Following the usage in Greek New Testament manuscripts, abbreviation of ''nomina sacra'' occurs as early as the late 2nd century|isbn= 9789004352520}}</ref> [[David Trobisch]] proposes that the replacement of ''YHWH'' to ''nomina sacra'' was a conscious editorial decision at the time of compiling both New and Old Testaments, in the second century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=89}}{{sfn|Trobisch|2000|pp=19}}\n\n== Tables related to \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 in the New Testament ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=6|Forms corresponding to the MT Tetragrammaton in some Greek OT and NT manuscripts\n|-https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Names_and_titles_of_God_in_the_New_Testament&action=history\n|'''Date'''\n|'''LXX/OG mss'''\n|'''Forms in LXX/OG mss'''\n|'''NT mss'''\n|'''Forms in NT mss'''\n|-\n|1st century BCE \n|4Q120 <br> P.

[[George Howard (Hebraist)|George Howard]] published in 1977 a thesis that Robert F. Shedinger calls \"somewhat speculative\", and whose \"revolutionary theological ramifications\" Howard himself drew out. He proposed that the original texts of the New Testament had \"YHWH\" (either in Hebrew characters or in a Greek transliteration) in their quotations from the Old Testament, but not elsewhere, and that it was replaced in the copies made during the second century.{{sfn|Shedinger|2001|pp=138}}\n\nDidier Fontaine observes that Howard's postulate is built on three further suppositions:\n{{quote|[Howard's] thesis boils down to simply this: it is possible that when quoting the OT, the NT authors retained the tetragram in their writings where it figured in the Greek text [i.e., the [[Septuagint]]]. Three observations allow this postulate: 1) the translators of the LXX retained the divine name in Hebrew or paleo-Hebrew in the Greek text\u2014that, at least, is what the manuscripts of the pre-Christian era indicate; 2) it was the Christians, not the Jews, who replaced these instances of the name with \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; and 3) the textual tradition of the NT contains variants that are explained well in this context.\"{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=11}}}}\n\nIn his concluding observations, Howard, recognizing \"the revolutionary nature\" of his thesis that at one time the tetragrammaton was employed in the New Testament, said that, if true, it would require further explanation on various questions:\n\n{{quote|If the Tetragram was used in the NT, how extensively was it used? Was it confined to OT quotations and OT paraphrastic allusions, or was it used in traditional phrases, such as \"the word of God / Lord\" (see the variants in Acts 6:7; 8:25; 12:24; 13:5; 13:44, 48; 14:25; 16:6, 32), \"in the day of the Lord\" (cf. variants in 1 Cor 5:5), \"through the will of God\" (cf. variants in Rom 15:32)? Was it also used in OT-like narratives such as we have in the first two chapters of Luke?{{sfn|Howard|1977|pp=82}}}}\n\nFontaine continues: \"The thesis of Howard has generally aroused negative reactions, like those of [[Carroll D. Osburn|C. Osburn]], [[Donald Juel|D. Juel]] or [[Bruce M. Metzger]]. In the case of Metzger, [Frank] Shaw shows how Howard's thesis has perhaps been distorted and cited in the wrong way.\" Fontaine indicates that dictation, in which what was communicated was the ''spoken'' equivalent of the Tetragrammaton, generally a surrogate (such as ''kurios'', not the Tetragrammaton itself) shows that the text of a Septuagint manuscript or of an original letter of [[Paul the Apostle]] could differ from that in an existing copy of the Septuagint and would thus explain the textual variations adduced in support of Howard's thesis.{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=11-12}}\n\nRobert J. Wilkinson rejects Howard's hypothesis: \"It is not possible to assert that all Jewish Greek biblical manuscripts had the Tetragrammaton, nor for that matter that someone reading a Tetragrammaton in a biblical text would necessarily transcribe it into another text as such rather than as, say, ''kurios'' [...}  this conjectured account has Christians initially quoting biblical texts in their own writings to make a clear distinction between Christ and Yhwh and then introducing 'confusion' by deciding to eliminate the Tetragrammaton from their own works. One may ask why they would do that and when.\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=94}} He says that Howard's article was influential with regard to certain \"denominational interests\", whom he identifies as those of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], whose enthusiastic response perhaps somewhat obscured the clarity of the situation (incompatible with those sectarian positions) of \"total absence of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton from all recovered early Christian Greek New Testament manuscripts and their texts\".{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=92\u201393}}\n\nLarry W. Hurtado remarks: \"Against the contentions of a few (e.g., George Howard), these remarkable developments [\"at a remarkably early point the exalted Jesus was associated with YHWH, such that practices and texts that originally applied to YHWH were 'extended' (so to speak) to include Jesus as the further referent\"] cannot be ascribed to some sort of textual confusion brought on by a supposedly later copyist practice of writing 'Kyrios' in place of YHWH in Greek biblical manuscripts. The developments in question exploded so early and so quickly to render any such a proposal irrelevant.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Larry W.

While in non-biblical material Jews freely used either the Tetragrammaton or a substitute such as \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, in copying the biblical text itself they carefully guarded the Tetragrammaton, a practice that they extended to translation into Greek but not into Aramaic (p.&nbsp;72); but, Howard said, in the earliest extant copies of the Christian LXX the tetragrammaton is not to be found and is almost universally replaced by \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (p.&nbsp;74). \"In all probability\", he said, \"the Tetragram in the Christian LXX began to be surrogated with the contracted words {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}} and {{overline|\u03b8\u03c2}} at least by the beginning of the second century\" (pp.&nbsp;74\u221275). \"Towards the end of the first century\", he said, \"Gentile Christians [...] substituted the words \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 [...] for the Tetragram\" (pp.&nbsp;76\u221277). Howard's theory was that, in the interval between the writing of the texts that were later compiled to form the New Testament and the adoption of these surrogates, quotations in those texts would have the Tetragrammaton: \"It is reasonable to believe that the NT writers, when quoting from Scripture, preserved the Tetragram within the biblical text. On the analogy of pre-Christian Jewish practice we can imagine that the NT text incorporated the Tetragram into its OT quotations and that the words \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 were used when secondary references to God were made in the comments that were based upon the quotations. The Tetragram in these quotations would, of course, have remained as long as it continued to be used in the Christian copies of the LXX. But when it was removed from the Greek OT, it was also removed from the quotations of the OT in the NT. Thus somewhere around the beginning of the second century the use of surrogates must have crowded out the Tetragram in both Testaments\" (p.&nbsp;77).{{sfn|Howard|1977|pp=77}}\n\nIn the following year 1978, Howard wrote in the popular-style [[Biblical Archaeology Review]]: \"I offer the following scenario of the history of the Tetragrammaton in the Greek Bible as a whole, including both testaments. First, as to the Old Testament- Jewish scribes always preserved the Tetragrammaton in their copies of the Septuagint both before and after the New Testament period. In all probability Jewish Christians wrote the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew as well. Toward the end of the first Christian century, when the church had become predominantly Gentile, the motive for retaining the Hebrew name for God was lost and the words kyrios and theos were substituted for it in Christian copies of Old Testament Septuagints. Both kyrios and theos were written in abbreviated form in a conscious effort to preserve the sacred nature of the divine name. Soon the original significance of the contractions was lost and many other contracted words were added. A similar pattern probably evolved with respect to the New Testament. ''When the Septuagint which the New Testament church used and quoted contained the Hebrew form of the divine name, the New Testament writers no doubt included the Tetragrammaton in their quotations.'' But when the Hebrew form for the divine name was eliminated in favor of Greek substitutes in the Septuagint, it was eliminated also from the New Testament quotations of the Septuagint.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=George Howard|title=The Name of God in the New Testament.

Hurtado]] stated that scholars are divided on their interpretation of the manuscript evidence on the Septuagint: \"In Septuagint manuscripts (dating from ca. 3rd century CE and later), \"Kyrios\" (Greek: \"Lord\") is used rather frequently. But some have proposed that the earliest practice was fairly consistently to translate YHWH with \"Kyrios\" (\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2), others that the Hebrew divine name was initially rendered phonetically as \u0399\u0391\u03a9 (\"Iao\"), and others that the divine name was originally retained in Hebrew characters.

On the basis of the available evidence, the analysis of the original representation of the Tetragrammaton in Greek Scriptures therefore focuses on the question of whether the first translators wrote either \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 or \u0399\u03b1\u03c9\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=p6Nb0o3qY6oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Emanuel+Tov+2008&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL3N2LstPlAhXINcAKHay8AcUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Emanuel%20Tov%202008&f=false Emanuel Tov, ''Hebrew Bible, Greek Bible and Qumran: Collected Essays'' (Mohr Siebeck 2008), chapter 23]</ref><ref>[http://www.emanueltov.info/docs/papers/23.Greek.2008.pdf?v=1.0 Extract of chapter 23, p. 20]</ref> Vasileiadis himself does not accept Pietersma's arguments, which are in direct contradiction of Howard's: he notes that, while Howard proposed that \"several OG/LXX manuscripts dated from the pre-Christian and Christian times preserve the Tetragrammaton where later Christian LXX codices read \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 [...] A. Pietersma proposed the reverse, that the original Alexandrian text of the LXX read \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 while the observed occurrence of the Tetragrammaton in pre-Christian LXX manuscripts represents an archaizing tendency within Palestinian Judaism. Nevertheless, Pietersma's explanation's however repeated may be has not proved convincing.\"{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2018|pp=18-19}} He also, in disagreement with Tov, questions the pre-Christian character of the manuscript with \u0399\u0391\u03a9, proposing instead the \"hypothesis of a Jewish Christian origin for the 4Q120 scroll\".{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2017|pp=51}} He reported others' rejection of Pietersma's arguments and their view that the original Septuagint text had either the Hebrew Tetragrammaton or the word \u0399\u0391\u03a9, without attributing to them support of Howard's hypothesis of the absence of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in the pre-Christian text of the Septuagint. Kilpatrick is reported by Robert J.

Frank Shaw, taking as his starting point the Septuagint manuscript [[4Q120]], which renders the name of the Israelite God not by \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 or \u03a0\u0399\u03a0\u0399 or \ud802\udd09\ud802\udd05\ud802\udd04\ud802\udd05, but by the word \u0399\u03b1\u03ce, rejects the arguments put forward in support of the various proposals: \"The matter of any (especially single) 'original' form of the divine name in the LXX is too complex, the evidence is too scattered and indefinite, and the various approaches offered for the issue are too simplistic\" (p. 158). In particular, he rejects the arguments for an original \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 put forward by Pietersma, R\u00f6sel and Perkins and the idea that the tetragrammaton was put in its place for the sake of making the Greek text conform more closely to the Hebrew.<ref>[http://www.thlz.com/artikel/19214/?inhalt=heft%3D2016%23r548 Bob Becking, Review of Frank Shaw, '' The Earliest Non-Mystical Jewish Use of \u0399\u03b1\u03c9'' in ''Theologische Literaturzeitung'' (November 2016)]</ref>{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=9}}{{sfn|Meyer|2016|}} He holds that \"there was no one 'original' form but different translators had different feelings, theological beliefs, motivations, and practices when it came to their handling of the name\".<ref>Shaw, Frank, ''The Earliest Non-Mystical Jewish Use of \u0399\u03b1\u03c9'' (Contributions to Biblical Exegesis and Theology, 70; Leuven/Paris/Walpole, Mass.: Peeters, 2014), p. 271</ref> There was, he says, \"considerable choice among ancient Jews and early Christians regarding how to refer to God\".<ref>[https://www.oapen.org/download?type=document&docid=401999 David T.

But since there is no sure proof that kyrios in these works is a substitute for the tetragram, we had better not draw on them. Similarly, we might appeal to Aristeas 155 which contains a near quotation of Deut 7:18, and Aristobulus who seems to make reference to Exod 9:3; but since these authors were transmitted by Christians, kyrios could be secondary.\"{{sfn|Pietersma|Cox|Wevers|1984|pp=93}}\n\nIn what in May 2019 [[Larry W. Hurtado]] called \"the most recent and most detailed study\" on the biblical sources,<ref name=\"May2019\"/> Anthony R. Meyer states in relation to Greek biblical manuscripts: \"While \u03b9\u03b1\u03c9 and the Hebrew Tetragrammaton are clearly attested in Greek biblical texts, absent from all [[Second Temple]] copies is the title \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 as a replacement for the Hebrew Tetragrammaton. \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 is the standard title for God in the major Christian codices of the fourth and fifth centuries CE [[Codex Vaticanus|Vaticanus]], [[Codex Sinaiticus|Sinaiticus]], and [[Codex Alexandrinus|Alexandrinus]] [...] this practice enters the extant record in the second century CE, and from that point on, Christian copies of Greek biblical texts invariably use the term \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 where the underlying Hebrew text reads the Tetragrammaton.\"{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=217\u2013218}} A. R. Meyer's study centers on Greek biblical manuscripts and Jewish-Greek literature from \"Hellenistic and early Roman periods, including Jewish-Hellenistic poets, historians, apologists, Philo, New Testament writings, and many works known today as Pseudepigrapha,\" and additionally in his work it reads that \"the Greek copies of these works date on paleographic grounds much later than the Second Temple period. As such, they do not offer a direct window into Jewish divine name practices from earlier times.\"{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=218}} A. R. Meyer claim: \"overall, the extant Second Temple Greek biblical manuscripts show the avoidance of the divine name in speech, but not in writing, the latter continued well into the first century CE, until Christian scribes largely took over the transmission of Jewish Greek biblical texts and worked to standardize terms for God with \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in the nomina sacra, a convention which seems to have been in force since earliest Christian transmission. Yet, it is improbable that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 entered Greek biblical manuscripts only in the first century CE. Apart from the widely held view that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 was used in reading Greek biblical texts that show evidence for avoiding the Tetragrammaton, Jewish religious uses of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, as indicated by epigraphic and literary sources that are implausible to explain as the result of later Christian scribal habits\u2014Greek additions to Esther, 2\u20133 Macc, Ach 70 and 71, 4Q126 (?), P. Fouad 203, and others\u2014show that Jews began using \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in writing around the second century BCE.\"{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=279}} Accordingly, he writes that \"the Septuagint manuscripts of the first century CE, which Philo and NT authors rely on for their quotations, could well have contained \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, but this does necessarily require that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 goes back to the Old Greek translation.\";{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=255-256}} and states: \"In summary of the use and non-use of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, the available epigraphic and literary evidence suggests that Jews began using \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in writing approximately during the second and first centuries BCE, but such uses are not uniform or standard. At both ends there are writers for whom \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 was not significant: the Jewish-Hellenistic authors of the early second century BCE and Josephus and 4 Macc of the late first century CE. But among these, other writers use \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, including the Greek additions earlier works (Esther, A\u2013F), original Jewish-Greek compositions (2 Macc), and also epigraphic sources (Ach 70 and Ach 71). Further evidence may be adduced from 4Q126, if the reading is accurate, and the apotropaic prayer of P. Fouad 203.\"{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=265}}\n\n=== New Testament treatment of Old Testament quotations ===\nIn 1871, [[Robert Baker Girdlestone]], who later became principal of [[Wycliffe Hall, Oxford]], wrote:\n{{quote|If [the Septuagint] had retained the word [Jehovah], or had even used one Greek word for Jehovah and another for Adonai, such usage would doubtless have been retained in the discourses and arguments of the N.T. Thus our Lord in quoting the 110th Psalm, [...] might have said \"Jehovah said unto Adoni.\"\n\nSupposing a Christian scholar were engaged in translating the Greek Testament into Hebrew, he would have to consider, each time the word \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 occurred, whether there was anything in the context to indicate its true Hebrew representative; and this is the difficulty which would arise in translating the N. T. into all languages if the title Jehovah had been allowed to stand in the O. T. The Hebrew Scriptures would be a guide in many passages: thus, wherever the expression 'the angel of the Lord' occurs, we know that the word Lord represents Jehovah; a similar conclusion as to the expression 'the word of the Lord' would be arrived at, if the precedent set by the O. T. were followed: so also in the case of the title 'the Lord of Hosts.' Wherever, on the contrary, the expression 'My Lord' or 'Our Lord' occurs, we should know that the word Jehovah would be inadmissible, and Adonai or Adoni would have to be used. But many passages would remain for which no rules could be framed.\n\nIt is to be noticed, in connection with this subject, that there are several passages in the O.T. referring to Jehovah which are adopted in the N.T. as fulfilled in the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus, in Joel 2.32, we read, 'Whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be saved'; but these words are applied to Jesus Christ in Rom. 10.13. St John (chap. 12.41), after quoting a certain passage from Isaiah, which there refers to Jehovah, affirms that it was a vision of the Glory of Christ (see Isa. 6.9,10). In Isa. 4.3, the preparation of the way of Jehovah is spoken of, but John the Baptist adopts it as referring to the preparation of the way of the Messiah. In Mal. 3.1, there seems to be a very important identification of Jehovah with the Messiah, for we read, 'Jehovah, whom ye (profess to) seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the angel of the covenant whom ye (profess to) delight in.' In Rom. 9.33, and in 1 Pet. 2.6\u22128, Christ is described as 'a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence', titles which appear to be given to Jehovah in Isa. 8.13,14. Again in Isa. 45.23\u221225, Jehovah says, 'Unto me every knee shall bow ... in Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified'. But in Phil. 2.3, we read that God 'hath highly exalted Christ Jesus, and hath given him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is {{LORD}} (surely Jehovah), to the glory of God the Father'.<ref>{{cite book|author=R.

This arises from the theological conviction that it is entirely appropriate to do so since, granted Jesus' identity, what is predicated of God can be predicated no less of him. In other passages, however, God sends the Messiah or the Davidic king, and Jesus himself is that Davidic king, thus establishing a distinction between God and Jesus. The subtleties of these diverse usages of OT texts meld with the complexities of NT Christology to constitute the essential building blocks of what would in time come to be called the doctrine of the Trinity.{{sfn|Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament|2007|p=xxv}}}}\n\nAn example often remarked on of a New Testament writer's application to Jesus of an Old Testament passage concerning the God of Israel is the use in Hebrews 1:10 of Psalm 102:25.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1omnb4D5uaMC&pg=PA69&dq=%22Hebrews+1:10%22+Psalm+102&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiV96zk_vHlAhW8UxUIHQ9RDpMQ6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&q=%22Hebrews%201%3A10%22%20Psalm%20102&f=false Philip Edgcumbe Hughes, ''A Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews'' (Eerdmans 1987), p. 69]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hN5iDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT226&dq=%22verses+25-27%22+familiar&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwim2-Dbg_LlAhV-QxUIHfvoBR0Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22verses%2025-27%22%20familiar&f=false Robert L.

Vasileiadis: \"There is compelling evidence, both explicit and implicit, that some of the Greek Bible copies\u2014like the ones read by Christians such as Irenaeus of Lyons, Origen, Eusebius of Caesarea, Tertullian, Jerome, and Ps-John Chrysostom\u2014were employing the use of \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 for the Tetragram. If this conclusion is valid, this would imply that for a few centuries \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 was prevailingly present within the Bible copies read by the dispersed Christian communities, side-by-side with Hebrew Tetragrammata and the increasingly dominant scribal device of ''nomina sacra''. As a result, a possible consequence is that \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 (or, less possibly, a similar Greek term) might well have appeared in the original NT copies\".{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2017|pp=29}}\n\n=== Further observations on the Howard hypothesis ===\n{{Confusing section|date=July 2019}}\nAccording to Didier Fontaine, no specialist has provided a satisfactory (written) solution to the variants reported by Howard. As a background here one might seemingly advance the idea that the Christological controversies are behind these variants \u2013 which seems satisfactory at first, but Shaw points out some latent problems. In an astounding way, great specialists in textual criticism like Metzger and Ehrman do not directly address the thesis of Howard on the variants, which is readily described as \"highly speculative.\" (Osburn). Those who have endorsed Howard's thesis often quote Romans 10.13 as an emblematic case; but Howard has never quoted this verse in his study: one cannot suspect his thesis on this ground. Shaw cites certain scholars who understand this passage, and the quotation of Joel, as referring to the Father.{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=16}}\n\nAlbert Pietersma studied the Pentateuch, proposed an original Kurios in the LXX,{{sfn|Pietersma|Cox|Wevers|1984|pp=87}} and states:\n{{quote|If correct, Howard\u2019s theory could produce interesting results for students of early Christianity, but as will be argued below, the foundation on which it has been built, namely, the ancient LXX, will not sustain it, though it might possibly still be debated whether perhaps the Palestinian copies with which the NT authors were familiar read some form of the tetragram.{{sfn|Pietersma|Cox|Wevers|1984|pp=87}}}}\n\nD. Fontaine claim that \"Indeed, it is particularly important to discredit the original presence of the tetragrammaton in the Septuagint (whatever its form may have been) because it is the starting point of G. Howard's thesis. It is therefore not surprising that from the beginning of the study, Pietersma is attacking Howard.\"{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=3}} D. Fontaine citing ''The Earliest Non-Mystical Jewish Use of \u0399\u03b1\u03c9'' wrote about A. Pietersma that \"[Frank] Shaw reports: \"his arguments are quite often sprinkled with provisos such as 'presumably' (94, 96), 'evidently' (96), 'in our view', 'at times' and 'it would seem' (98). To the critical reader all this hardly inspires any real notion of 'proof'\" (141).{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=7-8}} D. Fontaine also wrote that \"Shaw begins to address the most crucial topics. He thus attacks the thesis of Pietersma (134-149) and shows that it is not sustainable\".{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=7-8}} D. Fontaine also states:\n{{quote|[Frank] Shaw investigates the problem of dictation among NT writers, Paul, for example: did he dictate from the text of the LXX while using a substitute when he read the Name? Would one have sought out the manuscript in order to quote it exactly? (177) Shaw provides no answer: however, is clear from 1QIsaa (-II) this type of pro-cedure is not unknown \u2013 and above all it does not prevent the tetragram from appearing! For example, in Is. 3.17 \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 is put for \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 , and in the same verse, \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 is put for \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 .

D. Vasileiadis gives an answer that L. Hurtado calls his \"(final?) reiteration\": \"it is hard to believe that more than 4 centuries of manuscripts extant today would have not included even a trace of the \"Kyrios\" use in the Greek Bible/LXX copies [...] That is, if the rabbinical practice of using (or better, writing) \"Kyrios\" (as rendering of the Tetragrammaton) into the Bible text of the Greek-speaking Judaism was the pre-Christian mainstream practice we should have at least a sample of it. But this is not the case up to today. So, despite the hardly attempt to convince the audience for the rightness of Pietersma's proposal and overturn the \"scholarly consensus\" and \"the prevailing assumption\" \"that the original translators of the LXX never rendered the divine name with Kyrios, but kept the tetragrammaton in Hebrew or Palaeo-Hebrew characters, or that they used the transcription IAO\" (R\u00f6sel 2007:416), I think that Pietersma's proposal is not convincing. The hard (manuscript) evidence does not support this well-built theory. Moreover, it seems that more and more researchers admit that the \"Jewish practice of never pronouncing the name as it is written\" was not as widespread as it has been believed to be until recently. It is probable that despite the fact that the Temple/priestly intelligentsia might refrain or even forbade pronouncing the Tetragrammaton, at least the knowledge of the correct pronunciation of God's name (as was heard at least by the high priest until 70 CE) and respectively its utterance was common practice until at least the 1st century CE. The widespread use of the form IAO is supporting this view.<ref name=\"Hurtado2013\"/>\n\nIn an article that according to D. Fontaine, P. D.

However, as G. Howard argued, this scenario does not satisfactorily explain the subsequent Christological implications of the NT textual variants and the long and bloodstained theological disputes provoked. [...] Pietersma tried to revive the core of Baudissin\u2019s thesis, that is, that \"the LXX had rendered the divine name as kurios right from the beginning\" but \"today, however, Baudissin's view is generally discarded.\" [...] Regarding the sequence in which \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 appeared, M. R\u00f6sel concluded: \"I would speculate that the strange reading of \u0399\u0391\u03a9 is a secondary replacement that comes from a community (in Egypt?) that still pronounced the name of God in this way.\" [...] But the question remains: If there were a \u2018community in Egypt that still pronounced the name of God\u2019 during the first century BCE and the first century CE, why might there not have been such a community two centuries earlier when the LXX Torah was written down?.{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2017|pp=29}}\n\nAlong with Howard, [[Rolf Furuli]] suggested that the tetragrammaton may have been removed from the Greek manuscripts.{{sfn|Furuli|1999|pp=179-191}}{{sfn|Furuli|2011|}}{{sfn|Andrews|2018|pp=154}} Regarding nomina sacra, R.

However, we simply do not know whether or not the original writers may have abbreviated the word kurios as the copyists have done. Whether they did so or not, it seems clear that there would have been no question among early readers that KS consistently represented the word kurios, and thus the abbreviation can hardly be said to represent a textual corruption that leaves the reader\u2019s mind in doubt as to the original wording.{{sfn|Andrews|2018|}}\n\n[[David Trobisch]] proposes that ''YHWH'' survived in the manuscripts until c. 150, when the biblical canon was compiled.{{sfn|Trobisch|2000|pp=66-67}}<ref>{{cite book|title=Putting Jesus in His Place: The Case for the Deity of Christ|author1=Robert M.

However, while the notation is consistent, there is a problem with the application of the system: there are a number of instances where a nomen sacrum is contracted at one place in a manuscript, whereas in other locations it is not (12). Finally, while there is a uniform list of terms that can be designated as nomina sacra, it is highly significant that only \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2, \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, and \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 are consistently and regularly noted as nomina sacra in virtually all extant New Testament manuscripts.

Regarding the early text of the Christian Scriptures, Howard supported the thesis that the original texts of the New Testament preserved the Tetragrammaton (either in Hebrew scripts or in a Greek transliteration) in citations and allusions of the OT (Howard, ''\"The Tetragram\"''; idem, ''\"The Name of God\"''; idem, ''\"Tetragrammaton\"''). Shedinger proposed that the Syriac Diatessaron, composed some time after the middle of the second century  C.E.,  may  provide  additional  confirmation  of  Howard\u2019s  hypothesis  (''Tatian  and  the  Jewish  Scriptures'',  136\u2013140).  Additionally,  within the [[Syriac Peshitta#Syriac New Testament|Syriac Peshitta]] is discernible the distinction between \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 rendered as \u0710\u0733\u072a\u071d\u0733\u0721 (marya, which means \"lord\" and refers to the God as signified by the Tetragrammaton; see Lu 1:32) and \u0722\u0730\u072a\u0733\u0721 (maran, a more generic term for \"lord\"; see Joh 21:7).{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2014|pp=64}}}}\n\nPavlos D. Vasileiadis continues and cites to Muraoka, ''A Greek-Hebrew Aramaic Two-way Index to the Septuagint'' (72), and believes that kurios cannot be a synonym for YHWH: \"Bearing in mind that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in the late LXX copies is used to render more than twenty corresponding Hebrew terms or term combinations of the HB, in a similar manner the term \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 does comprise richer information in the Greek NT.\"{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2014|pp=64}} P. D. Vasileiadis and [[Nehemia Gordon]] in 2019 establish:\n{{quote|On the conceptual level, while some maintain that Jesus and his disciples observed the proscription against speaking the Tetragrammaton, others have concluded that \"it is possible that in oral speech Jesus and the disciples vocalized the divine name.\" Some have gone as far as to suggest that 'Jesus did not know the Jewish fear of pronouncing God's name.\nOn the textual level, the Tetragrammaton has not been found in any surviving Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. Does this mean that the Christian authors opted to use terms like \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 to translate the Tetragrammaton? For the time being we cannot give a definitive answer. As discussed above, it seems improbable that the Tetragrammaton-to-\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 convention\u2014as a kind of Septuagintalism\u2014existed when the New Testament texts were authored. The earliest surviving copies of the New Testament use the nomina sacra, a scribal convention for rendering terms like God and Lord, that expanded rapidly and widely along with the rapid increase of Christian Bible copying. But it becomes obvious from the parallel development of the Old Greek/Septuagint tradition that this practice first appears only in the second century CE and without following a strictly uniform pattern.\nAlthough the support for the use of the Tetragrammaton in Greek New Testament manuscripts is lacking, it is often possible to identify where \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 reflects the Tetragrammaton in contrast to where it reflects Hebrew terms such as adoni used of mortal men and angels.

On the analogy of pre-Christian Jewish practice we can imagine that the NT text incorporated the Tetragram into its OT quotations and that the words \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 were used when secondary references to God were made in the comments that were based upon the quotations.{{sfn|Howard|1977|pp=77}}}}\n\nSome groups go beyond this hypothesis, treating it as a certainty. The same groups differ from Howard also in presenting the New Testament authors as writing the Tetragrammaton \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 (in Hebrew or paleo-Hebrew script or at least in the Greek transcription \u0399\u0391\u03a9) in their own compositions, and not only in quotations from the (Septuagint) Old Testament. Each group uses its own judgment in choosing which instances of the words \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 outside the Old Testament quotations to translate as having originally been written not as \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 but as some representation of the Tetragrammaton.\n \nIn this, the groups also go beyond the distinction that all modern translators have to make between upper-case and lower-case letters, a distinction that did not exist when the New Testament books were composed. Accordingly, the word \"lord\" sometimes appears in lower case throughout,<ref>Matthew 11:25, 12:8; Mark 2:28; Luke 6:5, 10:21; Acts 17:24; 1 Corinthians 8:5; 1 Timothy 6:15; Revelation 17:14, 19:16</ref> sometimes with an initial capital, and sometimes, in reference to [[God the Father|God]] as distinct from Jesus, with capitals throughout.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=pYkn5RbltmwC&pg=PA34&dq=%22Finally+Larry+Walker%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0gKz4pM3jAhX1VRUIHfCRC80Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22Finally%20Larry%20Walker%22&f=false Glen G.

This usage is seen particularly in the numerous NT quotations from the OT where ''kyrios'' stands for Yahweh (e.g., Rom 4:8, Ps 32:2; Rom. 9:28-29, Isa. 10:22-23; Rom. 10:16, Isa. 53:1). Third, it is used of Jesus as ''kyrios'' (Matt. 10:24-25; John 13:16; 15:20; Rom 14:4; Eph. 6:5, 9; Col. 3:22: 4:1).{{sfn|Bock|2006|pp=127}}}}\n\n==== Angel of the Lord ====\nThe Greek phrase \u1f04\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 (''aggelos kuriou'' \u2013 \"[[angel of the Lord]]\") is found in {{bibleverse||Matthew|1:20|ESV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|1:24|ESV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|2:13|ESV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|2:19|ESV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|28:2|ESV}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|1:11|ESV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|2:9|ESV}}; {{bibleverse||John|5:4|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Acts|5:19|ESV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|8:26|ESV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|12:7|ESV}}, and {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|12:23|ESV}}.

As such, the written name ''kurios'' took on a whole new aura of significance. [...] [Hence arose] a special way of writing the divine name ''kurios'' in Greek. The result was {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}}, a contracted form, using the first and last letters of ''kurios''. Interestingly, a transitional stage\u2014between writing YHWH and {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}}\u2014can be witnessed in [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 656]]. (Though this codex is dated to the second century AD, it probably represents earlier practice.) [...] the original scribe left a four-letter space open [...] for someone else to fill in the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew. But it was not filled in with the Tetragrammaton. Instead, the divine name was squeezed in by another scribe with the name \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2. Evidently, there was no one qualified to fill in the space with the archaic-Hebrew form, so it was filled in with the Greek surrogate.\" He then pictures a situation where the second scribe filled in the empty space not with \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 but with {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}}, and in support quotes [[Harry Y. Gamble]], who, \"following G. Howard, reconstructed a similar scenario for the creation of the nomina sacra\".{{sfn|Comfort|2005|pp=209\u2013210}}\n\nComfort adds: \"Christians (whether Jews or Gentiles) would have first used the nomina sacra in Greek Old Testament texts, and then transferred this practice to New Testament manuscripts. These Old Testament writings could have been books of the Old Testament [...] [or] collections of testimonia\u2014i.e., excerpts of Old Testament passages (with commentary) that Christians compiled as proof texts for Christian claims and that the early Christian writers used for providing quotations in their writings, such as we see in Matthew's Gospel.\" {{sfn|Comfort|2005|pp=210\u2013211}} Howard, on the other hand, supposed that the New Testament writers took their quotations directly from Septuagint manuscripts (which he also supposed to have the Hebrew tetragrammaton), not from the handier testimonia. which might already have nomina sacra.\n\nRecognizing that \"the earliest extant testimony for the nomina sacra does not come from the Testimonia but from continuous Old Testament texts\" of the early second century, Comfort states: \"Regardless of whether the nomina sacra were invented in the testimonia stage or in early Christian Greek Old Testament manuscripts (i.e., first century), the significance is that they may have existed in written form before the Gospels and Epistles were written. As such, some of the New Testament writers themselves could have adopted these forms when they wrote their books. The presence of the nomina sacra in all the earliest Christian manuscripts dating from the early second century necessitates that it was a widespread practice established much earlier. If we place the origin of that practice to the autographs and/or early publications of the New Testament writings, it explains the universal proliferation thereafter.\"{{sfn|Comfort|2005|p=211}}\n\nGeorge Howard proposes that the change to the ''nomina sacra'' {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}} and {{overline|\u03b8\u03c2}} instead of YHWH in Christian copies of the Septuagint took place \"at least by the beginning of the second century\": it began \"towards the end of the first century\", and \"somewhere around the beginning of the second century [...] must have crowded out the Tetragram in both Testaments\".<ref name=Howard2/> Already by the late second century ''nomina sacra'' were used not only in New Testament manuscripts but also in inscriptions in [[Lycaonia]] (modern central Turkey).<ref>{{cite book|title=Early Christianity in Lycaonia and Adjacent Areas: From Paul to Amphilochius of Iconium, Early Christianity in Asia Minor|author=Cilliers Breytenbach, Christiane Zimmermann|publisher=BRILL|year=2018|url=https://books.google.com.gt/books?id=ztBCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false |quote=Following the usage in Greek New Testament manuscripts, abbreviation of ''nomina sacra'' occurs as early as the late 2nd century|isbn= 9789004352520}}</ref> [[David Trobisch]] proposes that the replacement of ''YHWH'' to ''nomina sacra'' was a conscious editorial decision at the time of compiling both New and Old Testaments, in the second century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=89}}{{sfn|Trobisch|2000|pp=19}}\n\n== Tables related to \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 in the New Testament ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=6|Forms corresponding to the MT Tetragrammaton in some Greek OT and NT manuscripts\n|-https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Names_and_titles_of_God_in_the_New_Testament&action=history\n|'''Date'''\n|'''LXX/OG mss'''\n|'''Forms in LXX/OG mss'''\n|'''NT mss'''\n|'''Forms in NT mss'''\n|-\n|1st century BCE \n|4Q120 <br> P.

[[George Howard (Hebraist)|George Howard]] published in 1977 a thesis that Robert F. Shedinger calls \"somewhat speculative\", and whose \"revolutionary theological ramifications\" Howard himself drew out. He proposed that the original texts of the New Testament had \"YHWH\" (either in Hebrew characters or in a Greek transliteration) in their quotations from the Old Testament, but not elsewhere, and that it was replaced in the copies made during the second century.{{sfn|Shedinger|2001|pp=138}}\n\nDidier Fontaine observes that Howard's postulate is built on three further suppositions:\n{{quote|[Howard's] thesis boils down to simply this: it is possible that when quoting the OT, the NT authors retained the tetragram in their writings where it figured in the Greek text [i.e., the [[Septuagint]]]. Three observations allow this postulate: 1) the translators of the LXX retained the divine name in Hebrew or paleo-Hebrew in the Greek text\u2014that, at least, is what the manuscripts of the pre-Christian era indicate; 2) it was the Christians, not the Jews, who replaced these instances of the name with \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; and 3) the textual tradition of the NT contains variants that are explained well in this context.\"{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=11}}}}\n\nIn his concluding observations, Howard, recognizing \"the revolutionary nature\" of his thesis that at one time the tetragrammaton was employed in the New Testament, said that, if true, it would require further explanation on various questions:\n\n{{quote|If the Tetragram was used in the NT, how extensively was it used? Was it confined to OT quotations and OT paraphrastic allusions, or was it used in traditional phrases, such as \"the word of God / Lord\" (see the variants in Acts 6:7; 8:25; 12:24; 13:5; 13:44, 48; 14:25; 16:6, 32), \"in the day of the Lord\" (cf. variants in 1 Cor 5:5), \"through the will of God\" (cf. variants in Rom 15:32)? Was it also used in OT-like narratives such as we have in the first two chapters of Luke?{{sfn|Howard|1977|pp=82}}}}\n\nFontaine continues: \"The thesis of Howard has generally aroused negative reactions, like those of [[Carroll D. Osburn|C. Osburn]], [[Donald Juel|D. Juel]] or [[Bruce M. Metzger]]. In the case of Metzger, [Frank] Shaw shows how Howard's thesis has perhaps been distorted and cited in the wrong way.\" Fontaine indicates that dictation, in which what was communicated was the ''spoken'' equivalent of the Tetragrammaton, generally a surrogate (such as ''kurios'', not the Tetragrammaton itself) shows that the text of a Septuagint manuscript or of an original letter of [[Paul the Apostle]] could differ from that in an existing copy of the Septuagint and would thus explain the textual variations adduced in support of Howard's thesis.{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=11-12}}\n\nRobert J. Wilkinson rejects Howard's hypothesis: \"It is not possible to assert that all Jewish Greek biblical manuscripts had the Tetragrammaton, nor for that matter that someone reading a Tetragrammaton in a biblical text would necessarily transcribe it into another text as such rather than as, say, ''kurios'' [...}  this conjectured account has Christians initially quoting biblical texts in their own writings to make a clear distinction between Christ and Yhwh and then introducing 'confusion' by deciding to eliminate the Tetragrammaton from their own works. One may ask why they would do that and when.\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=94}} He says that Howard's article was influential with regard to certain \"denominational interests\", whom he identifies as those of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], whose enthusiastic response perhaps somewhat obscured the clarity of the situation (incompatible with those sectarian positions) of \"total absence of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton from all recovered early Christian Greek New Testament manuscripts and their texts\".{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=92\u201393}}\n\nLarry W. Hurtado remarks: \"Against the contentions of a few (e.g., George Howard), these remarkable developments [\"at a remarkably early point the exalted Jesus was associated with YHWH, such that practices and texts that originally applied to YHWH were 'extended' (so to speak) to include Jesus as the further referent\"] cannot be ascribed to some sort of textual confusion brought on by a supposedly later copyist practice of writing 'Kyrios' in place of YHWH in Greek biblical manuscripts. The developments in question exploded so early and so quickly to render any such a proposal irrelevant.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Larry W.

While in non-biblical material Jews freely used either the Tetragrammaton or a substitute such as \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, in copying the biblical text itself they carefully guarded the Tetragrammaton, a practice that they extended to translation into Greek but not into Aramaic (p.&nbsp;72); but, Howard said, in the earliest extant copies of the Christian LXX the tetragrammaton is not to be found and is almost universally replaced by \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (p.&nbsp;74). \"In all probability\", he said, \"the Tetragram in the Christian LXX began to be surrogated with the contracted words {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}} and {{overline|\u03b8\u03c2}} at least by the beginning of the second century\" (pp.&nbsp;74\u221275). \"Towards the end of the first century\", he said, \"Gentile Christians [...] substituted the words \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 [...] for the Tetragram\" (pp.&nbsp;76\u221277). Howard's theory was that, in the interval between the writing of the texts that were later compiled to form the New Testament and the adoption of these surrogates, quotations in those texts would have the Tetragrammaton: \"It is reasonable to believe that the NT writers, when quoting from Scripture, preserved the Tetragram within the biblical text. On the analogy of pre-Christian Jewish practice we can imagine that the NT text incorporated the Tetragram into its OT quotations and that the words \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 were used when secondary references to God were made in the comments that were based upon the quotations. The Tetragram in these quotations would, of course, have remained as long as it continued to be used in the Christian copies of the LXX. But when it was removed from the Greek OT, it was also removed from the quotations of the OT in the NT. Thus somewhere around the beginning of the second century the use of surrogates must have crowded out the Tetragram in both Testaments\" (p.&nbsp;77).{{sfn|Howard|1977|pp=77}}\n\nIn the following year 1978, Howard wrote in the popular-style [[Biblical Archaeology Review]]: \"I offer the following scenario of the history of the Tetragrammaton in the Greek Bible as a whole, including both testaments. First, as to the Old Testament- Jewish scribes always preserved the Tetragrammaton in their copies of the Septuagint both before and after the New Testament period. In all probability Jewish Christians wrote the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew as well. Toward the end of the first Christian century, when the church had become predominantly Gentile, the motive for retaining the Hebrew name for God was lost and the words kyrios and theos were substituted for it in Christian copies of Old Testament Septuagints. Both kyrios and theos were written in abbreviated form in a conscious effort to preserve the sacred nature of the divine name. Soon the original significance of the contractions was lost and many other contracted words were added. A similar pattern probably evolved with respect to the New Testament. ''When the Septuagint which the New Testament church used and quoted contained the Hebrew form of the divine name, the New Testament writers no doubt included the Tetragrammaton in their quotations.'' But when the Hebrew form for the divine name was eliminated in favor of Greek substitutes in the Septuagint, it was eliminated also from the New Testament quotations of the Septuagint.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=George Howard|title=The Name of God in the New Testament.

But some have proposed that the earliest practice was fairly consistently to translate YHWH with \"Kyrios\" (\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2), others that the Hebrew divine name was initially rendered phonetically as \u0399\u0391\u03a9 (\"Iao\"), and others that the divine name was originally retained in Hebrew characters. To my knowledge, the most recent discussion of the matter is the recent journal article by Martin R\u00f6sel\".<ref name=\"Hurtado2013\">{{cite web|author=Larry Hurtado|website=Larry Hurtado's Blog|date=July 3, 2013|url=https://larryhurtado.wordpress.com/2013/07/03/the-divine-name-and-greek-translation/|title=The Divine Name and Greek Translation}}</ref>\n \nMartin R\u00f6sel holds that the Septuagint used \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 to represent the Tetragrammaton of the Hebrew text and that the appearance of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton in some copies of the Septuagint is due to a later substitution for the original \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2: \"By means of exegetical observations in the Greek version of the [[Torah]], it becomes clear that already the translators of the Septuagint have chosen 'Lord' (''kyrios'') as an appropriate representation of the ''tetragrammaton''; the replacement by the Hebrew ''tetragrammaton'' in some Greek manuscripts is not original.\"{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=411}} He recalls that, although \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 was obviously the name that early Christians read in their Greek Bible, \"Jewish versions of the Greek Bible, including Aquila and Symmachus as well as a few LXX manuscripts,\" had the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew letters or the form \u03a0\u0399\u03a0\u0399 imitating Hebrew \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 and also recalls the arguments for the originality of the Greek transcription \u0399\u0391\u03a9.{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=414\u2013419}} However, in view of the inconclusive nature of the analysis of the manuscripts, he proposes evidence internal to the Septuagint text that suggests that \"\u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 is the original representation of the first translators\", delimiting his research in this matter to the Pentateuch texts, since these were the earliest and provide a glimpse of a translator's theological thinking,{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=419}} for, as he said earlier, \"the translators of the Septuagint were influenced by theological considerations when choosing an equivalent for the divine name\".{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=411}} In some contexts, to avoid giving the impression of injustice or harshness on the part of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, they represent the Tetragrammaton instead by \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2.{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=420}} Thus the immediate context explains the use of \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 as avoidance of the default translation as \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2,{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=421\u2013422}} while \"it is hardly conceivable that later scribes should have changed a Hebrew ''tetragrammaton'' or Greek \u0399\u0391\u03a9 into a form of \u1f41 \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2\".{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=424}} The presence of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in the [[deuterocanonical books]] not translated from Hebrew but composed originally (like the New Testament) in Greek and in the works of Philo shows, R\u00f6sel says, that \"the use of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 as a representation of \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 must be pre-Christian in origin\".{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=425}} He adds that this use was not universal among Jews, as shown by the later replacement of the original Septuaginta \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 by the Hebrew Tetragrammaton; and he says that \"the \u0399\u0391\u03a9 readings in the biblical manuscript 4QLXXLevb are a mystery still awaiting sound explanation.

She accepts that the evidence comes from manuscripts of the Christian era and is therefore inconclusive, but she considers doubtful any explanation as due to Christian influence in the 1st or 2nd century the pronunciation of \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 as \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 by Hellenistic Jews.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RS7gMJWqX-cC&pg=PA213&dq=Spottorno+%C3%A1mbito+absoluto&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiml47DzIXkAhUFSBUIHTcgCF0Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Spottorno%20%C3%A1mbito%20absoluto&f=false M\u00aa V\u00aa Spottorno y D\u00edaz Caro, \"The Divine Name in Ezekiel Papyrus 967\" in Natalio Fern\u00e1ndez Marcos (editor), ''La Septuaginta en la Investigaci\u00f3n Contempor\u00e1nea (V Congreso de la IOSCS)'' (Editorial Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Scient\u00edficas, 1985), pp. 213, 216\u2013217]</ref>\n\nPietersma agrees with Dahl and Segal that, \"while preserved Jewish fragments of the Greek version have some form of transliteration for the tetragrammaton, ''Philo must have read kyrios in his texts''\",{{sfn|Pietersma|Cox|Wevers|1984|pp=93}} and then he adds that: \"there is only one way to negate the force of Philo\u2019s evidence on the equation of kyrios and the tetragram, and that is by making a distinction between what Philo ''saw'' in his Bible and what he ''understood'' and ''read'', but that issue we will turn to at a later point\".

On the basis of the available evidence, the analysis of the original representation of the Tetragrammaton in Greek Scriptures therefore focuses on the question of whether the first translators wrote either \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 or \u0399\u03b1\u03c9\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=p6Nb0o3qY6oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Emanuel+Tov+2008&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL3N2LstPlAhXINcAKHay8AcUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Emanuel%20Tov%202008&f=false Emanuel Tov, ''Hebrew Bible, Greek Bible and Qumran: Collected Essays'' (Mohr Siebeck 2008), chapter 23]</ref><ref>[http://www.emanueltov.info/docs/papers/23.Greek.2008.pdf?v=1.0 Extract of chapter 23, p. 20]</ref> Vasileiadis himself does not accept Pietersma's arguments, which are in direct contradiction of Howard's: he notes that, while Howard proposed that \"several OG/LXX manuscripts dated from the pre-Christian and Christian times preserve the Tetragrammaton where later Christian LXX codices read \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 [...] A.

As such, they do not offer a direct window into Jewish divine name practices from earlier times.\"{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=218}} A. R. Meyer claim: \"overall, the extant Second Temple Greek biblical manuscripts show the avoidance of the divine name in speech, but not in writing, the latter continued well into the first century CE, until Christian scribes largely took over the transmission of Jewish Greek biblical texts and worked to standardize terms for God with \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in the nomina sacra, a convention which seems to have been in force since earliest Christian transmission.

Fouad 203, and others\u2014show that Jews began using \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in writing around the second century BCE.\"{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=279}} Accordingly, he writes that \"the Septuagint manuscripts of the first century CE, which Philo and NT authors rely on for their quotations, could well have contained \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, but this does necessarily require that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 goes back to the Old Greek translation.\";{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=255-256}} and states: \"In summary of the use and non-use of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, the available epigraphic and literary evidence suggests that Jews began using \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in writing approximately during the second and first centuries BCE, but such uses are not uniform or standard. At both ends there are writers for whom \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 was not significant: the Jewish-Hellenistic authors of the early second century BCE and Josephus and 4 Macc of the late first century CE. But among these, other writers use \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, including the Greek additions earlier works (Esther, A\u2013F), original Jewish-Greek compositions (2 Macc), and also epigraphic sources (Ach 70 and Ach 71). Further evidence may be adduced from 4Q126, if the reading is accurate, and the apotropaic prayer of P. Fouad 203.\"{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=265}}\n\n=== New Testament treatment of Old Testament quotations ===\nIn 1871, [[Robert Baker Girdlestone]], who later became principal of [[Wycliffe Hall, Oxford]], wrote:\n{{quote|If [the Septuagint] had retained the word [Jehovah], or had even used one Greek word for Jehovah and another for Adonai, such usage would doubtless have been retained in the discourses and arguments of the N.T. Thus our Lord in quoting the 110th Psalm, [...] might have said \"Jehovah said unto Adoni.\"\n\nSupposing a Christian scholar were engaged in translating the Greek Testament into Hebrew, he would have to consider, each time the word \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 occurred, whether there was anything in the context to indicate its true Hebrew representative; and this is the difficulty which would arise in translating the N. T. into all languages if the title Jehovah had been allowed to stand in the O. T. The Hebrew Scriptures would be a guide in many passages: thus, wherever the expression 'the angel of the Lord' occurs, we know that the word Lord represents Jehovah; a similar conclusion as to the expression 'the word of the Lord' would be arrived at, if the precedent set by the O. T. were followed: so also in the case of the title 'the Lord of Hosts.' Wherever, on the contrary, the expression 'My Lord' or 'Our Lord' occurs, we should know that the word Jehovah would be inadmissible, and Adonai or Adoni would have to be used. But many passages would remain for which no rules could be framed.\n\nIt is to be noticed, in connection with this subject, that there are several passages in the O.T. referring to Jehovah which are adopted in the N.T. as fulfilled in the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus, in Joel 2.32, we read, 'Whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be saved'; but these words are applied to Jesus Christ in Rom. 10.13. St John (chap. 12.41), after quoting a certain passage from Isaiah, which there refers to Jehovah, affirms that it was a vision of the Glory of Christ (see Isa. 6.9,10). In Isa. 4.3, the preparation of the way of Jehovah is spoken of, but John the Baptist adopts it as referring to the preparation of the way of the Messiah. In Mal. 3.1, there seems to be a very important identification of Jehovah with the Messiah, for we read, 'Jehovah, whom ye (profess to) seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the angel of the covenant whom ye (profess to) delight in.' In Rom. 9.33, and in 1 Pet. 2.6\u22128, Christ is described as 'a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence', titles which appear to be given to Jehovah in Isa. 8.13,14. Again in Isa. 45.23\u221225, Jehovah says, 'Unto me every knee shall bow ... in Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified'. But in Phil. 2.3, we read that God 'hath highly exalted Christ Jesus, and hath given him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is {{LORD}} (surely Jehovah), to the glory of God the Father'.<ref>{{cite book|author=R.

This arises from the theological conviction that it is entirely appropriate to do so since, granted Jesus' identity, what is predicated of God can be predicated no less of him. In other passages, however, God sends the Messiah or the Davidic king, and Jesus himself is that Davidic king, thus establishing a distinction between God and Jesus.

Vasileiadis: \"There is compelling evidence, both explicit and implicit, that some of the Greek Bible copies\u2014like the ones read by Christians such as Irenaeus of Lyons, Origen, Eusebius of Caesarea, Tertullian, Jerome, and Ps-John Chrysostom\u2014were employing the use of \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 for the Tetragram. If this conclusion is valid, this would imply that for a few centuries \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 was prevailingly present within the Bible copies read by the dispersed Christian communities, side-by-side with Hebrew Tetragrammata and the increasingly dominant scribal device of ''nomina sacra''. As a result, a possible consequence is that \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 (or, less possibly, a similar Greek term) might well have appeared in the original NT copies\".{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2017|pp=29}}\n\n=== Further observations on the Howard hypothesis ===\n{{Confusing section|date=July 2019}}\nAccording to Didier Fontaine, no specialist has provided a satisfactory (written) solution to the variants reported by Howard. As a background here one might seemingly advance the idea that the Christological controversies are behind these variants \u2013 which seems satisfactory at first, but Shaw points out some latent problems. In an astounding way, great specialists in textual criticism like Metzger and Ehrman do not directly address the thesis of Howard on the variants, which is readily described as \"highly speculative.\" (Osburn). Those who have endorsed Howard's thesis often quote Romans 10.13 as an emblematic case; but Howard has never quoted this verse in his study: one cannot suspect his thesis on this ground. Shaw cites certain scholars who understand this passage, and the quotation of Joel, as referring to the Father.{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=16}}\n\nAlbert Pietersma studied the Pentateuch, proposed an original Kurios in the LXX,{{sfn|Pietersma|Cox|Wevers|1984|pp=87}} and states:\n{{quote|If correct, Howard\u2019s theory could produce interesting results for students of early Christianity, but as will be argued below, the foundation on which it has been built, namely, the ancient LXX, will not sustain it, though it might possibly still be debated whether perhaps the Palestinian copies with which the NT authors were familiar read some form of the tetragram.{{sfn|Pietersma|Cox|Wevers|1984|pp=87}}}}\n\nD. Fontaine claim that \"Indeed, it is particularly important to discredit the original presence of the tetragrammaton in the Septuagint (whatever its form may have been) because it is the starting point of G. Howard's thesis. It is therefore not surprising that from the beginning of the study, Pietersma is attacking Howard.\"{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=3}} D. Fontaine citing ''The Earliest Non-Mystical Jewish Use of \u0399\u03b1\u03c9'' wrote about A. Pietersma that \"[Frank] Shaw reports: \"his arguments are quite often sprinkled with provisos such as 'presumably' (94, 96), 'evidently' (96), 'in our view', 'at times' and 'it would seem' (98). To the critical reader all this hardly inspires any real notion of 'proof'\" (141).{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=7-8}} D. Fontaine also wrote that \"Shaw begins to address the most crucial topics. He thus attacks the thesis of Pietersma (134-149) and shows that it is not sustainable\".{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=7-8}} D. Fontaine also states:\n{{quote|[Frank] Shaw investigates the problem of dictation among NT writers, Paul, for example: did he dictate from the text of the LXX while using a substitute when he read the Name? Would one have sought out the manuscript in order to quote it exactly? (177) Shaw provides no answer: however, is clear from 1QIsaa (-II) this type of pro-cedure is not unknown \u2013 and above all it does not prevent the tetragram from appearing! For example, in Is. 3.17 \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 is put for \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 , and in the same verse, \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 is put for \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 . This proves that an amanuensis could very well have heard the qer\u00e9 \"Lord\" and decided that, according to the context, whether he had to write \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 or \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 . In the case of a Christian amanuensis, nothing forbids thinking of an identical process: while hearing the qer\u00e9 \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, \"Lord\", the scribe could have decided according to the context to write the tetragram or not. Incidentally, this could account for the variants which Howard highlights\u2026 Furthermore, the hypothesis of a Hebrazing recension would not be an obstacle for this scenario: the Christian authors were quite able to turn to these types of \"more exact\" manuscripts, and we know that they existed at their time (cf. 179).{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=11-12}}}}\n\n[[Emanuel Tov]] affirmed: \"in some book of the New Testament and in early Christian literature, Hebraizing revisions of the OG often were quoted rather than the OG version itself, reflecting the beginning of the decline of the LXX (the OG) in Judaism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Emanuel Tov|title=Hebrew Bible, Greek Bible and Qumran: Collected Essays|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|year=2008|isbn=9783161495465|url=https://books.google.com.gt/books?id=p6Nb0o3qY6oC&pg=PA365}}</ref> According to Tuukka Kauhanen, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Faculty of Theology at [[University of Helsinki]], the authors of the New Testament could to know a [[kaige]] type Septuagint text.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Legacy of Barthelemy: 50 Years After Les Devanciers D'Aquila|publisher=V&r Academic|year=2017|isbn=978-3525540626|author=Tuukka Kauhanen|editor=Anneli Aejmelaeus, Tuukka Kauhanen}}</ref> Some scholars have exposed different views to explain why in citation of [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 12:10 in [[Gospel of John|John]] 19:37 \"with known forms of the text reveals that it demonstrates many similarities with the Hebrew Masoretic text\",<ref name=Bynum>{{cite book|isbn=9789004229143|work=The Fourth Gospel and the Scriptures: Illuminating the Form and Meaning of Scriptural Citation in John 19:37|publisher=BRILL|year=2012|author=Wm.

Fontaine objects that: \"Even if kyrios was used orally by the Hellenic-speaking Jews (which is very far from being acquired, see Shaw 2002), the written practice might be different\" and he adds that \"what is annoying is that Pietersma supports a thesis that not only has no textual proof, but is mostly overturned by textual evidence.\"<ref name = Fontaine4/> P. D. Vasileiadis gives an answer that L. Hurtado calls his \"(final?) reiteration\": \"it is hard to believe that more than 4 centuries of manuscripts extant today would have not included even a trace of the \"Kyrios\" use in the Greek Bible/LXX copies [...] That is, if the rabbinical practice of using (or better, writing) \"Kyrios\" (as rendering of the Tetragrammaton) into the Bible text of the Greek-speaking Judaism was the pre-Christian mainstream practice we should have at least a sample of it. But this is not the case up to today. So, despite the hardly attempt to convince the audience for the rightness of Pietersma's proposal and overturn the \"scholarly consensus\" and \"the prevailing assumption\" \"that the original translators of the LXX never rendered the divine name with Kyrios, but kept the tetragrammaton in Hebrew or Palaeo-Hebrew characters, or that they used the transcription IAO\" (R\u00f6sel 2007:416), I think that Pietersma's proposal is not convincing. The hard (manuscript) evidence does not support this well-built theory. Moreover, it seems that more and more researchers admit that the \"Jewish practice of never pronouncing the name as it is written\" was not as widespread as it has been believed to be until recently. It is probable that despite the fact that the Temple/priestly intelligentsia might refrain or even forbade pronouncing the Tetragrammaton, at least the knowledge of the correct pronunciation of God's name (as was heard at least by the high priest until 70 CE) and respectively its utterance was common practice until at least the 1st century CE.

Regarding the early text of the Christian Scriptures, Howard supported the thesis that the original texts of the New Testament preserved the Tetragrammaton (either in Hebrew scripts or in a Greek transliteration) in citations and allusions of the OT (Howard, ''\"The Tetragram\"''; idem, ''\"The Name of God\"''; idem, ''\"Tetragrammaton\"''). Shedinger proposed that the Syriac Diatessaron, composed some time after the middle of the second century  C.E.,  may  provide  additional  confirmation  of  Howard\u2019s  hypothesis  (''Tatian  and  the  Jewish  Scriptures'',  136\u2013140).  Additionally,  within the [[Syriac Peshitta#Syriac New Testament|Syriac Peshitta]] is discernible the distinction between \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 rendered as \u0710\u0733\u072a\u071d\u0733\u0721 (marya, which means \"lord\" and refers to the God as signified by the Tetragrammaton; see Lu 1:32) and \u0722\u0730\u072a\u0733\u0721 (maran, a more generic term for \"lord\"; see Joh 21:7).{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2014|pp=64}}}}\n\nPavlos D. Vasileiadis continues and cites to Muraoka, ''A Greek-Hebrew Aramaic Two-way Index to the Septuagint'' (72), and believes that kurios cannot be a synonym for YHWH: \"Bearing in mind that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in the late LXX copies is used to render more than twenty corresponding Hebrew terms or term combinations of the HB, in a similar manner the term \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 does comprise richer information in the Greek NT.\"{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2014|pp=64}} P. D. Vasileiadis and [[Nehemia Gordon]] in 2019 establish:\n{{quote|On the conceptual level, while some maintain that Jesus and his disciples observed the proscription against speaking the Tetragrammaton, others have concluded that \"it is possible that in oral speech Jesus and the disciples vocalized the divine name.\" Some have gone as far as to suggest that 'Jesus did not know the Jewish fear of pronouncing God's name.\nOn the textual level, the Tetragrammaton has not been found in any surviving Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. Does this mean that the Christian authors opted to use terms like \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 to translate the Tetragrammaton? For the time being we cannot give a definitive answer. As discussed above, it seems improbable that the Tetragrammaton-to-\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 convention\u2014as a kind of Septuagintalism\u2014existed when the New Testament texts were authored. The earliest surviving copies of the New Testament use the nomina sacra, a scribal convention for rendering terms like God and Lord, that expanded rapidly and widely along with the rapid increase of Christian Bible copying. But it becomes obvious from the parallel development of the Old Greek/Septuagint tradition that this practice first appears only in the second century CE and without following a strictly uniform pattern.\nAlthough the support for the use of the Tetragrammaton in Greek New Testament manuscripts is lacking, it is often possible to identify where \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 reflects the Tetragrammaton in contrast to where it reflects Hebrew terms such as adoni used of mortal men and angels. Several scholars have attempted this undertaking..., with the result being an average of 64.4 instances of the Tetragrammaton in the Gospels.{{sfn|Vasileiadis|Gordon|2019|pp=6}}}}\n\nR.

Each group uses its own judgment in choosing which instances of the words \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 outside the Old Testament quotations to translate as having originally been written not as \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 but as some representation of the Tetragrammaton.\n \nIn this, the groups also go beyond the distinction that all modern translators have to make between upper-case and lower-case letters, a distinction that did not exist when the New Testament books were composed. Accordingly, the word \"lord\" sometimes appears in lower case throughout,<ref>Matthew 11:25, 12:8; Mark 2:28; Luke 6:5, 10:21; Acts 17:24; 1 Corinthians 8:5; 1 Timothy 6:15; Revelation 17:14, 19:16</ref> sometimes with an initial capital, and sometimes, in reference to [[God the Father|God]] as distinct from Jesus, with capitals throughout.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=pYkn5RbltmwC&pg=PA34&dq=%22Finally+Larry+Walker%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0gKz4pM3jAhX1VRUIHfCRC80Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22Finally%20Larry%20Walker%22&f=false Glen G.

In this, they are in line with all existing manuscripts of the Greek New Testament.\n\nDifferent translations of the New Testament earlier than the publication of Howard's 1977 hypothesis rendered \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 of the Greek text as \"Jehovah\" or, if the target language was Hebrew, \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 or \u05d4\u05e9\u05dd, without proposing that the original word in the New Testament text was not \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 but \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4.<ref name=Pierro/> Matteo Pierro drew up a list of 135 translations of the New Testament, from the 14th century on, that used the Hebrew tetragram itself, \"Jehovah\", \"Yahweh\" or related forms: 26 into Hebrew with \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4, twenty in other languages with a translated form throughout, seven with a translated form frequently, while others use a translated form in specified verses.<ref name=Pierro>{{cite book|author=Matteo Pierro|title=Geova e il Nuovo Testamento|trans-title=Jehovah and the New Testament|publisher=Sacchi Editore, Rescaldina (Milano), Italy|year=2000|pp=140\u2013146}}</ref> These 135 translations represent a minute proportion of the existing translations of the New Testament, which by 1 October 2019 has been translated into 2246 different languages, in some of which it exists in dozens of distinct translations.<ref>[https://www.wycliffe.net/resources/scripture-access-statistics/ Scripture Access Statistics (Wycliffe Global Alliance)]</ref>\n\nAs indicated above, capitalization of \"Lord\" in quotations from the Old Testament is a matter of editorial choice and does not necessarily indicate belief that the New Testament texts once displayed some form of the Tetragrammaton instead of \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 or \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2.

Until today, these marching bands represent a characteristic element in the parades for [[History of Sudan (1956\u201369)|Independence Day]] or other official celebrations.\n\n==The 1920s - Haqibah and the origins of modern Sudanese music==\nModern Sudanese music has its roots in [[haqibah]] style music (pronounced ''hagee-ba'' and meaning ''\"briefcase\"''). It originated in the early 1920s, and was originally derived from the Islamic praise of the prophet, known as [[madeeh]]. Haqibah is essentially a [[harmonic]] vocal style, with percussion coming from the [[tambourine]]-like [[riq]] and from other instruments. Occasionally, tonal instruments such as the [[piano]] and the [[qanun (instrument)|qanun]] (a stringed instrument) are used.\n\n{{Quote|text=The original Briefcase (translated from the Arabic El Haqiba), is a large and somewhat ill-defined collection of Sudanese songs from the mid 20th century, combining strong words and songs by both Sudanese and non-Sudanese poets and musicians. The name comes from the briefcase that the radio presenter Ahmed Osman used to carry the records in and from which he selected the different tracks to play on his radio show back in the 1920s.

Thus, it has a rich and very diverse musical culture, ranging from traditional folk music to Sudanese popular urban music of the 20th century and up to the internationally influenced [[African pop music|African popular music]] of today.

This period was marked by the introduction of tonal instruments from both East and West, such as the [[violin]], [[accordion]], [[oud]], [[tabla]] and [[bongo drum|bongo]]. A [[big band]] style came into existence, mirroring trends in the [[Western world|West]]. Post-haqibah, like haqibah, was based on the [[pentatonic]] scale.  Haqibah mixed with Egyptian and European elements is called ''al-aghani al-hadith''(modern songs).\n\nThe 1940s saw an influx of new names due to the rise of live radio shows at Radio Omdurman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.voanews.com/music-time-in-africa/2009/12/16/the-golden-era-of-omdurman-songs/|title=The Golden Era of Omdurman Songs \u00ab Music Time in Africa|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> Early performers included Ismail Abdul Mennen, Hassan Atya, and Ahmed al Mustafa. Ismael Abdul Queen was a pioneer who strived to adapt to the new conditions and deserted the old style. He was followed by a singer-songwriter called Ahmed Ibrahim Falah. But both were soon overtaken by [[Ibrahim al Kashif]], who became known as the \"Father of modern singing\". Al Kashif began to sing under the influence of Haj Mohamed Ahmed Sarour and relied on what the pioneer of Sudanese singing Abdel-Karim Karouma had started, renewing these popular singing styles. For live performances, there were also two dance halls in Khartoum, St James' and the Gordon Music Hall.\n\n== The 1960s up to the 1980s - International influence of Western and African pop music ==\n\nIn the 1960s, American pop stars became well known, which had a profound effect on Sudanese musicians like Osman Alamu and Ibrahim Awad, the latter becoming the first Sudanese musician to dance onstage.<ref name=\"roughguide\" />  Under these influences, Sudanese popular music saw a further [[Westernisation]], with the introduction of [[guitar]]s and [[brass]] instruments; guitars came from the south of the country, played like the [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]lese guitar styles.

The lyrics were also poetic and popular. Up to the 2010s, Sharhabil's band has been one of the leading names in Sudanese music, performing both at home as well as internationally.\n\nStarting in the 1940s, female singers became socially acceptable with the rise of Mihera bint Abboud, Um el Hassan el Shaygiya and [[Aisha Musa Ahmad|Aisha al Falatiya]], who as early as 1943 was the first woman to sing on Sudanese radio.

She falls in with a group of rebel [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]] from [[Clan]] MacKenzie, who are being pursued by English [[Red coat (military uniform)|redcoats]] led by Captain Jonathan \"Black Jack\" Randall, Frank's ancestor. She marries a Highlander, Jamie Fraser, out of necessity, but they quickly fall in love.

Developed by [[Ronald D. Moore]], the show premiered on August 9, 2014, on [[Starz]]. It stars [[Caitriona Balfe]] as [[Claire Fraser (character)|Claire Randall]], a married former [[World War II]] nurse who in 1946 finds herself transported back to [[Scotland]] in 1743. There she encounters the dashing [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] warrior [[Jamie Fraser (character)|Jamie Fraser]] ([[Sam Heughan]]) and becomes embroiled in the [[Jacobite risings]]. The first season of the television series is based on the first novel in the series, ''[[Outlander (novel)|Outlander]]'' (also known as ''Cross Stitch'').\n\nThe second season of 13 episodes, based on ''[[Dragonfly in Amber]]'', premiered on April 9, 2016. On June 1, Starz renewed the series for a third and fourth season, which adapt the third and fourth ''Outlander'' novels, ''[[Voyager (novel)|Voyager]]'' and ''[[Drums of Autumn]],'' respectively. The 13-episode third season premiered on September 10, 2017. The 13-episode fourth season premiered on November 4, 2018. Starz has renewed the series for fifth and sixth seasons; the fifth premiered on February 16, 2020.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n{{main|List of Outlander episodes}}\n{{:List of Outlander episodes}}\n\n===Season 1 (2014\u201315)===\nIn 1946, former World War II nurse Claire Randall and her husband Frank are visiting [[Inverness]], Scotland, when she is carried from the standing stones at Craigh na Dun back in time to 1743. She falls in with a group of rebel [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]] from [[Clan]] MacKenzie, who are being pursued by English [[Red coat (military uniform)|redcoats]] led by Captain Jonathan \"Black Jack\" Randall, Frank's ancestor. She marries a Highlander, Jamie Fraser, out of necessity, but they quickly fall in love. The Clan suspect her of being a spy, and retain her as a healer, preventing her from attempting to return to her own time. Knowing that the Jacobite cause is doomed to fail, Claire tries to warn them against rebellion. Her husband Jamie is captured, tortured, and raped by the sadistic Randall, but Claire and his clansmen rescue him. Claire tells Jamie that she is pregnant and they set sail for France.\n\n===Season 2 (2016)===\nIn Paris, Claire and Jamie try to thwart the Jacobites by subverting the funds that King [[Louis XV of France]] is likely to provide. Jamie becomes the confidante of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Charles Stuart]], but the Frasers fail to prevent the risings. Randall reappears in Paris, but Claire makes Jamie swear to keep him alive until Frank's descent is assured. She achieves this by convincing Randall to marry Mary Hawkins. Claire loses her baby, and she and Jamie return to Scotland. The Jacobites win the [[Battle of Prestonpans]].\n\nBefore the [[Battle of Culloden]], Jamie convinces Claire, pregnant again, to return to the 20th century. Jamie decides to die fighting at Culloden with his clan. Back in her own century, Claire tells Frank about her time travel. He asks her to forget Jamie, and let him raise their child as his own. Twenty years later, Frank has died. Claire takes her daughter Brianna to Scotland. Claire discovers that Jamie did not die at Culloden, and vows to return to him.\n\n===Season 3 (2017)===\nJamie kills Randall at Culloden, and is gravely injured, but spared execution. At Ardsmuir prison, he befriends the governor [[Lord John Grey (character)|Lord John Grey]], who later paroles him to work at an English estate. There Jamie is manipulated into a sexual liaison and fathers an illegitimate son, William. Jamie returns to Scotland and becomes a printer.\n\nIn 1948, Claire enrolls in medical school in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Frank is killed in a car accident while Brianna is in college. With the help of Roger Wakefield, Claire finds clues to Jamie's fate after Culloden. She returns to the 18th century, and discovers Jamie has married a widowed Laoghaire. Claire's return nullifies their union as illegal. They try to retrieve some hidden treasure so that he can placate Laoghaire with a settlement. But his nephew Ian is captured by pirates and taken to the Caribbean. Jamie and Claire follow, and manage to rescue him from Geillis (who had escaped burning at the stake in season one). Claire and Jamie sail for Scotland, but are shipwrecked on the coast of [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]].\n\n===Season 4 (2018\u201319)===\nIn the [[Thirteen Colonies|British colony]] of [[Province of North-Carolina|North Carolina]], Claire and Jamie seek to return to Scotland with Fergus, Marsali, and Ian. They visit the plantation of Jamie's aunt Jocasta Cameron, where they see conditions of [[slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]]. Claire and Jamie decide to leave, and claim land that they name Fraser's Ridge, which is already inhabited by [[Cherokee]]. Jamie reunites with Murtagh, now a [[blacksmith]] and leader of the [[War of the Regulation|Regulator movement]]. Lord John visits with Jamie's son, Willy. \n\nIn the 1970s, Brianna rejects Roger's marriage proposal. After learning her parents will die in a fire, Brianna travels through the stones. Roger follows her. They meet in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] and enter into [[handfast marriage]].  Bonnet rapes Brianna. She discovers she is pregnant. Roger goes to Fraser's Ridge where Jamie wrongly assumes that he is the rapist, and beats him. Young Ian sells Roger to the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]. Discovering their mistake, they set off to rescue Roger, and Ian trades his freedom for Roger's. Roger and Brianna are reunited at Jocasta's plantation. Jamie receives instructions to kill Murtagh, who is a fugitive.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Outlander characters}}\n{{Div col}}\n<!-- Only list actors who are credited in the opening titles. -->\n* [[Caitriona Balfe]] as [[Claire Fraser (character)|Claire Beauchamp Randall/Fraser]]\n* [[Sam Heughan]] as [[Jamie Fraser (character)|James \"Jamie\" MacKenzie Fraser]]\n* [[Tobias Menzies]] as Frank Randall (seasons 1\u20134){{efn|Menzies only appears in one episode of season four, although credited as a main cast member.}} /<br>Jonathan \"Black Jack\" Randall (seasons 1\u20133)\n* [[Graham McTavish]] as Dougal MacKenzie (seasons 1\u20132) /<br>William \"Buck\" MacKenzie (season 5)\n* Duncan Lacroix as Murtagh Fitzgibbons Fraser (seasons 1\u20135)\n* Grant O'Rourke as Rupert MacKenzie (seasons 1\u20133){{efn|O'Rourke only appears in one episode of season three, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Stephen Walters]] as Angus Mhor (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Colum MacKenzie (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Lotte Verbeek]] as Geillis Duncan {{a.k.a.}} Gillian Edgars (seasons 1\u20133){{efn|Verbeek only appears in one episode of season two, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as Edward \"Ned\" Gowan (seasons 1, 3){{efn|Paterson only appears in one episode of season three, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Simon Callow]] as Clarence Marylebone, Duke of Sandringham (seasons 1\u20132){{efn|Callow only appears in one episode of season one, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Laura Donnelly (actress)|Laura Donnelly]] as Janet \"Jenny\" Fraser Murray (seasons 1\u20133){{efn|Donnelly only appears in one episode of season two, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Douglas Henshall]] as Taran MacQuarrie (season 1)\n* [[Steven Cree]] as Ian Murray (seasons 1\u20134){{efn|Cree only appears in one episode of season two and one episode of season four, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Stanley Weber]] as [[Count of St. Germain|Le Comte St. Germain]] (season 2)\n* [[Andrew Gower (actor)|Andrew Gower]] as Prince [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (seasons 2\u20133){{efn|Gower only appears in one episode of season three, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Rosie Day]] as Mary Hawkins (season 2)\n* [[Dominique Pinon]] as Master Raymond (season 2)\n* [[Frances de la Tour]] as Mother Hildegarde (season 2)\n* [[Nell Hudson]] as Laoghaire MacKenzie (seasons 2\u20134;

{"title_page": "Darius the Mede", "text_new": "{{short description|Biblical character}}\n[[File:Lambrechtshagen Kirche Empore4.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Detail from the church of Lambrechtshagen, Germany, 1759: [[Daniel in the lions' den]] with Darius the Mede above.]]\n'''Darius the Mede''' is mentioned in the [[Book of Daniel]] as king of [[Babylon]] between [[Belshazzar]] and [[Cyrus the Great]], but he is not known to history, and no additional king can be placed between the known figures of Belshazzar and Cyrus.{{sfn|Coleman|1990|p=198}} Most scholars view him as a literary fiction, but some have tried to harmonise the Book of Daniel with history by identifying him with various known figures, notably Cyrus or [[Gobryas]], the general who was first to enter Babylon when it fell to the Persians in 539 BCE.{{sfn|Hill|2009|p=114}}\n\n== Book of Daniel ==\nDarius the Mede is first mentioned in the story of [[Belshazzar's feast]] ([[Daniel 5]]). Belshazzar, king of [[Babylon]], holds a great feast, during which a hand appears and writes on the wall: \"''MENE'', ''MENE'', ''TEKEL'', and ''PARSIN''\" ({{Hebrew|\u05de\u05e0\u05d0 \u05de\u05e0\u05d0 \u05ea\u05e7\u05dc \u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05e1\u05d9\u05df}}). Daniel interprets the words: Belshazzar has been weighed and found wanting, and his kingdom is to be divided between the [[Medes]] and Persians. The story concludes: \"That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean (Babylonian) king was killed, and Darius the Mede received the kingdom.\"{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=74-75}} \n\nIn the story of [[Daniel in the lions' den]] ([[Daniel 6]]), Daniel has continued to serve at the royal court under Darius, and has been raised to high office. His jealous rivals plot his downfall, tricking Darius into issuing a decree that no prayers should be addressed to any god or man but to Darius himself, on pain of death. Daniel continues to pray to the God of Israel, and Darius, although deeply distressed, must condemn him to be thrown into the lions' den because the edicts of the Medes and Persians cannot be altered. At daybreak the king hurries to the place and Daniel tells him that his God sent an angel to save him. Darius commands that those who had conspired against Daniel should be thrown to the lions in his place, along with their wives and children.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=85-86}}\n\nThe final appearance of Darius is in [[Daniel 9]], which presents a vision of Daniel relating to the end-time travails and triumph of the Israelites over their enemies. The mention of Darius is used as a chronological marker, placing the vision in \"the first year of Darius son of [[Ahasuerus]]\".{{sfn|Knibb|2006|p=435}}\n\n==Historical and literary background==\n[[Image:Cyrus invasion of Babylonia.svg|right|thumb|250px|The Persian invasion of Babylonia, September\u2013October 539 BC, showing Gutium, Opis, and Babylon.]]\n\n===Medes and the fall of Babylon===\nThe [[Medes]] came to prominence in 612 BCE when they joined with the [[Neo-Babylonian empire|Babylonians]] in overthrowing [[Neo-Assyrian empire|Assyria]]. Little is known about them, but they were possibly a significant power in the Middle East for several decades thereafter. The fall of their empire is recorded in a Babylonian inscription from around 553 BCE  (a second report puts the event in 550 BCE) reporting that the Median king has been conquered by \"[[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], king of [[Anshan (Persia)|Anshan]],\" in south-western Iran: this is the first appearance of Cyrus in the historical record, and the beginning of the rapid rise of the [[Achaemenid empire|Persians]].\n\nAfter extending his empire from the Mediterranean to Central Asia, Cyrus turned his attention to Babylonia. The most important ancient sources for his conquest of Babylon are the [[Nabonidus Chronicle]] ([[Nabonidus]] was the last Babylonian king, and [[Belshazzar]], who is described as king of Babylon in the Book of Daniel, was his son and crown prince), the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], and the Verse Account of Nabonidus\u2014which, despite its name, was commissioned by Cyrus.{{sfn|Waters|2014|p=38-39,43}}\n\nCyrus' Babylonian campaign began in 539 BCE, although there were presumably previous tensions. On 10 October Cyrus won a battle at [[Battle of Opis|Opis]], opening the way to Babylon, and on 12 October \"[[Gubaru|Ugbaru]], governor of the district of [[Gutium]], and the army of Cyrus entered Babylon without a battle\" (Babylonian Chronicle). Ugbaru is presumably the same person as the Gorbyras mentioned by the Greek historian [[Xenophon]], a Babylonian provincial governor who switched to the Persian side. Cyrus made his entrance into the city a few days later; Nabonidus was captured and his life spared, but nothing is known of the fate of Belshazzar.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=41-42}}\n\n===Biblical Book of Daniel===\nThe [[Book of Daniel]] is not regarded by scholars as a reliable guide to history.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=1}} The broad consensus is that Daniel never existed, and that the author appears to have taken the name from a legendary hero of the distant past mentioned in the [[Book of Ezekiel]].{{sfn|Collins|1999|p=219-220}}{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=3-4}} The book that bears his name is an [[apocalypse]], not a book of prophecy, and its contents form a cryptic allusion to the persecution of the Jews by the Syrian king [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] (reigned 175\u2013164 BCE).{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=29}}{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2002|p=74}} There is broad agreement that the stories making up chapters 1\u20136 are legendary in character, and that the visions of chapters 7\u201312 were added during the persecution of Antiochus, the book itself being completed soon after 164 BCE.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=2}}\n\n[[Daniel 5]] and [[Daniel 6]] belong to the folktales making up the first half of the book.{{sfn|Mobley|2012|p=135-136}} The language of Daniel 5 (\"Belshazzar's Feast\"), for example, follows ancient Near Eastern conventions which are in some cases precisely those used in Daniel.{{sfn|Paul|2002|p=59}} Daniel 6 (\"Daniel in the Lions' Den\") is based on the classic Babylonian folk-tale ''Ludlul-bel-nemeqi'', telling of a courtier who suffers disgrace at the hands of evil enemies but is eventually restored due to the intervention of a kindly god (in the story in Daniel, this is the God of Israel): in the Babylonian original the \"pit of lions\" is a metaphor for human adversaries at court, but the biblical tale has turned the metaphorical lions into real animals.{{sfn|Van Der Toorn|2001|p=43}}\n\nIn [[Daniel 9]], Daniel, pondering the meaning of [[Jeremiah]]'s prediction that [[Jerusalem]] would remain desolate for seventy years, is told by the angel [[Gabriel]] that the 70 years should be taken to mean seventy weeks (literally \"sevens\") of years.{{sfn|Collins|2003|p=75}} Verse 1 sets the time of Daniel's vision as the \"first year of Darius son of [[Ahasuerus]], by birth a Mede\",{{sfn|Levine|2010|p=1251 fn.9.1\u201319}} but no Darius is known to history, nor can any king of Babylon be placed between the genuine historical figures of Belshazzar and Cyrus.{{sfn|Coleman|1990|p=198}}\n\n==Identity==\n[[Image:Achaemenid coin daric 420BC front.jpg|thumb|right|Gold [[Persian daric]] (with a purity of 95.83%) issued by Darius the Great, c. 490 BCE).]]\n[[H. H. Rowley]]'s 1935 study of the question (''Darius the Mede and the Four World Empires of Darius the Mede'', 1935) has shown that Darius the Mede cannot be identified with any king,{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=192}} and he is generally seen today as a literary fiction combining the historical Persian king [[Darius I]] and the words of [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 51:11 that God \"stirred up\" the Medes against Babylon.{{sfn|Hill|2009|p=114}} Nevertheless, numerous attempts have been made to identify him with historical figures, with the following being perhaps the best-known candidates:{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=192}} \n \n*[[Darius the Great]] (Darius I Hystaspes), c. 550\u2013486 BCE. This historically known Darius was the third Persian emperor, and an important figure for Jews in the early Persian period because of his role in the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=95}} At the beginning of his career Darius had to (re)conquer Babylon to remove a usurper, before expanding the empire and dividing it into satrapies.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=115}}{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=191-192}} The author of Daniel, mindful of certain prophecies that the Medes would destroy Babylon (Jeremiah 51:11,28 and Isaiah 13:17), and needing a Median king to complete his four-kingdom schema (see the story of Nebuchadnezzar's dream in [[Daniel 2]]), appears to have taken the historic Darius and projected him into a fictional past.{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=191-192}}\n*[[Astyages]]. Astyages was the last king of the Medes; he was defeated by Cyrus in 550 (or 553), his father was named Cyaxares (not Ahasuerus/Xerxes), and there is no record of him being present at the fall of Babylon. Consequently, he gets little attention in modern apologetics, but the 1st century CE Jewish historian Josephus, followed later by the early Christian Church Father [[Jerome]], harmonised Daniel with the historical sources by claiming that Darius the Mede was a son of Astyages.{{sfn|Shea|1982|p=231}}{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=191-192}}\n*\"[[Cyaxares II]]\". The Greek writer [[Xenophon]] tells of a Median king called Cyaxares who was the son of Astyages; other Greek historians say that Astyages had no son. According to Xenophon, Cyrus became king of Media through marriage to Cyaxares' daughter\u2014contradicting all other sources, notably the Babylonian, which say Cyrus won Media by conquest from Astyages. Xenophon is not given credence by historians, and he does not, in any case, say that this otherwise unknown Cyaxares ruled Babylon.{{sfn|Shea|1982|p=231-232}}\n*[[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]]. This argument hinges on a reinterpretation of Daniel 6:28, \"\"Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius, and the reign of Cyrus the Persian\", to read \"Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius, even the reign of Cyrus the Persian\", making them the same individual. William Shea, a conservative scholar, comments that it would be strange to refer to Cyrus the Persian, son of [[Cambyses I]], as Darius the Mede, son of Ahasuerus, and strange also to refer to the same king as Cyrus in some passages and Darius in others.{{sfn|Shea|1982|p=232-233}}\n*[[Cambyses II]]. Cambyses was Cyrus' son and his successor as emperor. The Babylonian records indicate that Cyrus installed him as regent in Babylon, but he was not a Mede, his father was not Ahasuerus, and he was probably not sixty-two years old.{{sfn|Shea|1982|p=233}}\n*[[Gobryas|Gubaru]] (or Ugbaru, called Gobryas in Greek sources), the general who was the first to enter Babylon. Ugbaru was the Babylonian governor of Gutium (an area closely associated with Media in Babylonian sources) before switching sides to the Persians, and Cyrus seems to have given him administrative responsibility for Babylon after its capture, but he never held the title \"King of Babylon\".{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=192}}\n\n==References==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* {{Cite book\n|last                           = Briant\n|first                          = Pierre\n|title                          = From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire\n|year                           = 2002\n|publisher                      = Eisenbrauns\n|url                            = https://books.google.com/?id=lxQ9W6F1oSYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|ref                            = harv\n|isbn                          = 9781575061207\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n|last                           = Coleman\n|first                          = G.

the church of Lambrechtshagen, Germany, 1759: [[Daniel in the lions' den]] with Darius the Mede above.]]\n'''Darius the Mede''' is mentioned in the [[Book of Daniel]] as king of [[Babylon]] between [[Belshazzar]] and [[Cyrus the Great]], but he is not known to history, and no additional king can be placed between the known figures of Belshazzar and Cyrus.{{sfn|Coleman|1990|p=198}} Most scholars view him as a literary fiction, but some have tried to harmonise the Book of Daniel with history by identifying him with various known figures, notably Cyrus or [[Gobryas]], the general who was first to enter Babylon when it fell to the Persians in 539 BCE.{{sfn|Hill|2009|p=114}}\n\n== Book of Daniel ==\nDarius the Mede is first mentioned in the story of [[Belshazzar's feast]] ([[Daniel 5]]). Belshazzar, king of [[Babylon]], holds a great feast, during which a hand appears and writes on the wall: \"''MENE'', ''MENE'', ''TEKEL'', and ''PARSIN''\" ({{Hebrew|\u05de\u05e0\u05d0 \u05de\u05e0\u05d0 \u05ea\u05e7\u05dc \u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05e1\u05d9\u05df}}). Daniel interprets the words: Belshazzar has been weighed and found wanting, and his kingdom is to be divided between the [[Medes]] and Persians. The story concludes: \"That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean (Babylonian) king was killed, and Darius the Mede received the kingdom.\"{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=74-75}} \n\nIn the story of [[Daniel in the lions' den]] ([[Daniel 6]]), Daniel has continued to serve at the royal court under Darius, and has been raised to high office. His jealous rivals plot his downfall, tricking Darius into issuing a decree that no prayers should be addressed to any god or man but to Darius himself, on pain of death. Daniel continues to pray to the God of Israel, and Darius, although deeply distressed, must condemn him to be thrown into the lions' den because the edicts of the Medes and Persians cannot be altered. At daybreak the king hurries to the place and Daniel tells him that his God sent an angel to save him. Darius commands that those who had conspired against Daniel should be thrown to the lions in his place, along with their wives and children.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=85-86}}\n\nThe final appearance of Darius is in [[Daniel 9]], which presents a vision of Daniel relating to the end-time travails and triumph of the Israelites over their enemies. The mention of Darius is used as a chronological marker, placing the vision in \"the first year of Darius son of [[Ahasuerus]]\".{{sfn|Knibb|2006|p=435}}\n\n==Historical and literary background==\n[[Image:Cyrus invasion of Babylonia.svg|right|thumb|250px|The Persian invasion of Babylonia, September\u2013October 539 BC, showing Gutium, Opis, and Babylon.]]\n\n===Medes and the fall of Babylon===\nThe [[Medes]] came to prominence in 612 BCE when they joined with the [[Neo-Babylonian empire|Babylonians]] in overthrowing [[Neo-Assyrian empire|Assyria]]. Little is known about them, but they were possibly a significant power in the Middle East for several decades thereafter. The fall of their empire is recorded in a Babylonian inscription from around 553 BCE  (a second report puts the event in 550 BCE) reporting that the Median king has been conquered by \"[[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], king of [[Anshan (Persia)|Anshan]],\" in south-western Iran: this is the first appearance of Cyrus in the historical record, and the beginning of the rapid rise of the [[Achaemenid empire|Persians]].\n\nAfter extending his empire from the Mediterranean to Central Asia, Cyrus turned his attention to Babylonia. The most important ancient sources for his conquest of Babylon are the [[Nabonidus Chronicle]] ([[Nabonidus]] was the last Babylonian king, and [[Belshazzar]], who is described as king of Babylon in the Book of Daniel, was his son and crown prince), the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], and the Verse Account of Nabonidus\u2014which, despite its name, was commissioned by Cyrus.{{sfn|Waters|2014|p=38-39,43}}\n\nCyrus' Babylonian campaign began in 539 BCE, although there were presumably previous tensions. On 10 October Cyrus won a battle at [[Battle of Opis|Opis]], opening the way to Babylon, and on 12 October \"[[Gubaru|Ugbaru]], governor of the district of [[Gutium]], and the army of Cyrus entered Babylon without a battle\" (Babylonian Chronicle). Ugbaru is presumably the same person as the Gorbyras mentioned by the Greek historian [[Xenophon]], a Babylonian provincial governor who switched to the Persian side. Cyrus made his entrance into the city a few days later; Nabonidus was captured and his life spared, but nothing is known of the fate of Belshazzar.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=41-42}}\n\n===Biblical Book of Daniel===\nThe [[Book of Daniel]] is not regarded by scholars as a reliable guide to history.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=1}} The broad consensus is that Daniel never existed, and that the author appears to have taken the name from a legendary hero of the distant past mentioned in the [[Book of Ezekiel]].{{sfn|Collins|1999|p=219-220}}{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=3-4}} The book that bears his name is an [[apocalypse]], not a book of prophecy, and its contents form a cryptic allusion to the persecution of the Jews by the Syrian king [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] (reigned 175\u2013164 BCE).{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=29}}{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2002|p=74}} There is broad agreement that the stories making up chapters 1\u20136 are legendary in character, and that the visions of chapters 7\u201312 were added during the persecution of Antiochus, the book itself being completed soon after 164 BCE.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=2}}\n\n[[Daniel 5]] and [[Daniel 6]] belong to the folktales making up the first half of the book.{{sfn|Mobley|2012|p=135-136}} The language of Daniel 5 (\"Belshazzar's Feast\"), for example, follows ancient Near Eastern conventions which are in some cases precisely those used in Daniel.{{sfn|Paul|2002|p=59}} Daniel 6 (\"Daniel in the Lions' Den\") is based on the classic Babylonian folk-tale ''Ludlul-bel-nemeqi'', telling of a courtier who suffers disgrace at the hands of evil enemies but is eventually restored due to the intervention of a kindly god (in the story in Daniel, this is the God of Israel): in the Babylonian original the \"pit of lions\" is a metaphor for human adversaries at court, but the biblical tale has turned the metaphorical lions into real animals.{{sfn|Van Der Toorn|2001|p=43}}\n\nIn [[Daniel 9]], Daniel, pondering the meaning of [[Jeremiah]]'s prediction that [[Jerusalem]] would remain desolate for seventy years, is told by the angel [[Gabriel]] that the 70 years should be taken to mean seventy weeks (literally \"sevens\") of years.{{sfn|Collins|2003|p=75}} Verse 1 sets the time of Daniel's vision as the \"first year of Darius son of [[Ahasuerus]], by birth a Mede\",{{sfn|Levine|2010|p=1251 fn.9.1\u201319}} but no Darius is known to history, nor can any king of Babylon be placed between the genuine historical figures of Belshazzar and Cyrus.{{sfn|Coleman|1990|p=198}}\n\n==Identity==\n[[Image:Achaemenid coin daric 420BC front.jpg|thumb|right|Gold [[Persian daric]] (with a purity of 95.83%) issued by Darius the Great, c. 490 BCE).]]\n[[H. H. Rowley]]'s 1935 study of the question (''Darius the Mede and the Four World Empires of Darius the Mede'', 1935) proposed that Darius the Mede cannot be identified with any king,{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=192}} and he is generally seen today as a literary fiction combining the historical Persian king [[Darius I]] and the words of [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 51:11 that God \"stirred up\" the Medes against Babylon.{{sfn|Hill|2009|p=114}} Nevertheless, numerous attempts have been made to identify him with historical figures, with the following being perhaps the best-known candidates:{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=192}} \n \n*[[Darius the Great]] (Darius I Hystaspes), c. 550\u2013486 BCE. This historically known Darius was the third Persian emperor, and an important figure for Jews in the early Persian period because of his role in the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=95}} At the beginning of his career Darius had to (re)conquer Babylon to remove a usurper, before expanding the empire and dividing it into satrapies.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=115}}{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=191-192}} The author of Daniel, mindful of certain prophecies that the Medes would destroy Babylon (Jeremiah 51:11,28 and Isaiah 13:17), and needing a Median king to complete his four-kingdom schema (see the story of Nebuchadnezzar's dream in [[Daniel 2]]), appears to have taken the historic Darius and projected him into a fictional past.{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=191-192}}\n*[[Astyages]]. Astyages was the last king of the Medes; he was defeated by Cyrus in 550 (or 553), his father was named Cyaxares (not Ahasuerus/Xerxes), and there is no record of him being present at the fall of Babylon. Consequently, he gets little attention in modern apologetics, but the 1st century CE Jewish historian Josephus, followed later by the early Christian Church Father [[Jerome]], harmonised Daniel with the historical sources by claiming that Darius the Mede was a son of Astyages.{{sfn|Shea|1982|p=231}}{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=191-192}}\n*\"[[Cyaxares II]]\". The Greek writer [[Xenophon]] tells of a Median king called Cyaxares who was the son of Astyages; other Greek historians say that Astyages had no son. According to Xenophon, Cyrus became king of Media through marriage to Cyaxares' daughter\u2014contradicting all other sources, notably the Babylonian, which say Cyrus won Media by conquest from Astyages. Xenophon is not given credence by historians, and he does not, in any case, say that this otherwise unknown Cyaxares ruled Babylon.{{sfn|Shea|1982|p=231-232}}\n*[[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]]. This argument hinges on a reinterpretation of Daniel 6:28, \"\"Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius, and the reign of Cyrus the Persian\", to read \"Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius, even the reign of Cyrus the Persian\", making them the same individual. William Shea, a conservative scholar, comments that it would be strange to refer to Cyrus the Persian, son of [[Cambyses I]], as Darius the Mede, son of Ahasuerus, and strange also to refer to the same king as Cyrus in some passages and Darius in others.{{sfn|Shea|1982|p=232-233}}\n*[[Cambyses II]]. Cambyses was Cyrus' son and his successor as emperor. The Babylonian records indicate that Cyrus installed him as regent in Babylon, but he was not a Mede, his father was not Ahasuerus, and he was probably not sixty-two years old.{{sfn|Shea|1982|p=233}}\n*[[Gobryas|Gubaru]] (or Ugbaru, called Gobryas in Greek sources), the general who was the first to enter Babylon. Ugbaru was the Babylonian governor of Gutium (an area closely associated with Media in Babylonian sources) before switching sides to the Persians, and Cyrus seems to have given him administrative responsibility for Babylon after its capture, but he never held the title \"King of Babylon\".{{sfn|Newsom|Breed|2014|p=192}}\n\n==References==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* {{Cite book\n|last                           = Briant\n|first                          = Pierre\n|title                          = From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire\n|year                           = 2002\n|publisher                      = Eisenbrauns\n|url                            = https://books.google.com/?id=lxQ9W6F1oSYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|ref                            = harv\n|isbn                          = 9781575061207\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n|last                           = Coleman\n|first                          = G.

He was also Chairman of the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]], and in the second half of 2006 he was [[President of the European Council]]. In his earlier career he was a journalist. Vanhanen is the son of professor [[Tatu Vanhanen]] and Anni Tiihonen.\n\n==Career==\nVanhanen studied [[political science]] at the [[University of Helsinki]], graduating as a Master of [[Social Science]]s in 1989.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/laitos/alumni/index.htm |title=Yleisen valtio-opin laitos |publisher=Valt.helsinki.fi |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=2010-06-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703051031/http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/laitos/alumni/index.htm |archivedate=3 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He was chairman of the Centre Party Youth League from 1980 to 1983. He also served as a member of the [[Espoo]] City Council from 1981 to 1984. Vanhanen used to work as a journalist. He was an editor (1985\u20131988) and editor-in-chief (1988\u20131991) at the local newspaper ''Keh\u00e4sanomat''. In a column in ''[[Suomenmaa]]'' (the Centre Party's organ), he strongly condemned the ''Baltic Star'' pro-Estonian independence demonstration held in Helsinki in July 1985, calling the demonstration \"provocative\".<ref>[http://kavkaz.fi/vanhanen.html Matti Vanhanen, Suomenmaa 30.7.1985 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720185147/http://kavkaz.fi/vanhanen.html |date=20 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nVanhanen was elected to the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament (Eduskunta)]] in 1991. As a member of Parliament he was interested in ecological issues. For instance, Vanhanen spoke against the building of a fifth [[nuclear power plant]] in 1992, at the same time as serving on the board of electricity corporation [[Fortum]]. He served on the Parliamentary Environment Committee 1991\u20131995, and was chair of the Parliamentary Grand Committee 2000\u20132001. He was vice-chair of the Centre Party Parliamentary group 1994\u20132001, and Deputy Chairman of the Centre Party 2000\u20132003.\n\nAnother important topic for Vanhanen was [[Foreign relations of Finland|Finland's foreign and security policy]]. As a specialist on the [[European Union]] he was a member of the [[Convention on the Future of Europe|European Union Constitutional Convention]]. There he criticised the president of the convention, former French president [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]], as [[authoritarian]]. Vanhanen has said<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suomenkuvalehti.fi/?id=5835 |title=Suomenkuvalehti.fi |publisher=Suomenkuvalehti.fi |date=12 March 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref> that he is unenthusiastic about European co-operation, and that he is an \"EU pragmatist\", so he may be considered a [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptic]], especially when compared to his EU-enthusiast predecessor [[Paavo Lipponen]].\n\n===Vanhanen's first cabinet===\nVanhanen resigned from the Constitutional Convention in 2003 when he became Minister of Defense in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Anneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki]]. After J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki's resignation, Vanhanen [[Matti Vanhanen's first cabinet|was elected Prime Minister]] and [[Matti Vanhanen's first cabinet|his first cabinet]] was formed.\n\nAs a politician, Vanhanen is considered to be part of the liberal wing of the old agrarian Central Party, along with the two other Party ministers from [[Uusimaa|Uusimaa region]]. His government cut the top state income tax rate from 35.5% to 33.5% in 2005 and 32.5% in 2006 (resulting in approximately 55% total tax rate after local government and social security taxes). The corporate tax rate was also lowered to 26% and capital gains to 28% (both formerly 29%), though at the same time dividends were partially made taxable. Vanhanen has said he is willing to continue tax cuts.\n\n===Presidential candidate===\n[[File:World leaders at the 32nd G8 Summit, Strelna, Russia - 20060716.jpg|thumb|right|Vanhanen after [[2006 Finnish presidential election|Finnish 2006 presidential elections]] in G8 Summit in [[Strelna]], Russia. Left to right: [[Romano Prodi]], [[Angela Merkel]], [[Tony Blair]], [[Jacques Chirac]], [[Vladimir Putin]], [[George W. Bush]], [[Junichiro Koizumi]], [[Stephen Harper]], Matti Vanhanen and [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]].]]\nAs the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] candidate, Vanhanen challenged [[president of Finland|President]] [[Tarja Halonen]] in the 2006 [[2006 Finnish presidential election|Finnish presidential election]]. He received 18.6% of the vote, coming third to the [[National Coalition Party (Finland)|National Coalition Party]]'s [[Sauli Niinist\u00f6]] (24.1%) and [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrat]] and incumbent [[Tarja Halonen]] (46.3%), and thus did not qualify for the runoff. Vanhanen expressed his support for Niinist\u00f6 in the runoff election against his coalition partner's candidate Halonen.\n\nThe presidential election, and co-operation between Centre Party and National Coalition Party, proved to be a major strain on the government coalition between the Centre Party and Social Democrats. The flashpoint came in March, when the Centre Party demanded national [[Agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] to cover farmers' losses when the Finnish exception in the European Union's [[Common Agricultural Policy]] was about to expire. At the end of the crisis Vanhanen told his parliamentary group that taxpayers would cover ninety percent or about 100 million euros in losses.\n\n===Vanhanen's second cabinet===\n[[File:Vanhasen II hallitus.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Vanhanen's second cabinet.]]\nAfter the [[2007 Finnish parliamentary election|March 2007 election]] the Centre Party narrowly remained the largest party after losing four seats. However their coalition partner, the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|SDP]], lost eight seats and the centre-right [[National Coalition Party (Finland)|National Coalition Party]] gained ten. [[Matti Vanhanen's second cabinet|Vanhanen's second cabinet]] was formed on a centre-right basis, with minor partners the [[Green League]] and the [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]].\n\nA scandal involving Vanhanen's second cabinet began rolling in May 2008, after the leader of the Centre Party's parliamentary group [[Timo Kalli]] said publicly that he would not reveal information about his [[campaign finance]]s, because such disclosure was not required. After a media backlash, Kalli gave up his secrecy and listed a group of businessmen known as \"Kehittyvien maakuntien Suomi\" (KMS; in English, \"The Finland of Developing Regions\"), who had financed the Centre Party. Centre Party links with KMS were suspected, as one address of the organisation belonged to a party official. It was later revealed that the organisation had been formed in the Centre Party's general secretary's office.\n\nAfter the Russian response to the Georgian invasion of South Ossetia, Vanhanen said that Finland would rethink its security.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2008/08/vanhanen_finland_to_rethink_security_following_crisis_in_georgia_314968.html |title=Vanhanen: Finland to Rethink Security Following Crisis in Georgia |publisher=Yle.fi |accessdate=2010-06-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229204507/http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2008/08/vanhanen_finland_to_rethink_security_following_crisis_in_georgia_314968.html |archivedate=29 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nVanhanen's cabinet proposed raising the retirement age from 63 to 65 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/200902289164604_uu.shtml |title=Vanhanen: El\u00e4kei\u00e4n korotus l\u00e4hti minun aloitteestani |publisher=Iltalehti.fi |date=28 February 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/kotimaa.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2009/02/818706 |title=Vanhanen: El\u00e4kei\u00e4n nostolla maksetaan laman laskut |publisher=Mtv3.fi |date=25 February 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-5730671 |title=PM Vanhanen: \"Necessary to Raise Pension Age\" |publisher=Yle.fi |date=8 March 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23 }}</ref> His proposal was fiercely opposed by the [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions]] (Finnish acronym SAK), which is affiliated with the SDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taloussanomat.fi/tyomarkkinat/2009/03/02/sak--uhkaa-katkaista-valit-hallitukseen/20095555/12 |title=SAK uhkaa katkaista v\u00e4lit hallitukseen |publisher=Taloussanomat.fi |date=3 February 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2009, Vanhanen announced that he would step down as chair of the Centre Party at its June 2010 convention.

Because the charges concerned Vanhanen's actions while in office, the decision whether he should be prosecuted fell to the Constitutional Law Committee of the [[Finnish Parliament]].

He was also Chairman of the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]], and in the second half of 2006 he was [[President of the European Council]]. In his earlier career he was a journalist. Vanhanen is the son of professor [[Tatu Vanhanen]] and Anni Tiihonen.\n\n==Career==\nVanhanen studied [[political science]] at the [[University of Helsinki]], graduating as a Master of [[Social Science]]s in 1989.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/laitos/alumni/index.htm |title=Yleisen valtio-opin laitos |publisher=Valt.helsinki.fi |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=2010-06-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703051031/http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/laitos/alumni/index.htm |archivedate=3 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He was chairman of the Centre Party Youth League from 1980 to 1983. He also served as a member of the [[Espoo]] City Council from 1981 to 1984. Vanhanen used to work as a journalist. He was an editor (1985\u20131988) and editor-in-chief (1988\u20131991) at the local newspaper ''Keh\u00e4sanomat''. In a column in ''[[Suomenmaa]]'' (the Centre Party's organ), he strongly condemned the ''Baltic Star'' pro-Estonian independence demonstration held in Helsinki in July 1985, calling the demonstration \"provocative\".<ref>[http://kavkaz.fi/vanhanen.html Matti Vanhanen, Suomenmaa 30.7.1985 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720185147/http://kavkaz.fi/vanhanen.html |date=20 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nVanhanen was elected to the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament (Eduskunta)]] in 1991. As a member of Parliament he was interested in ecological issues. For instance, Vanhanen spoke against the building of a fifth [[nuclear power plant]] in 1992, at the same time as serving on the board of electricity corporation [[Fortum]]. He served on the Parliamentary Environment Committee 1991\u20131995, and was chair of the Parliamentary Grand Committee 2000\u20132001. He was vice-chair of the Centre Party Parliamentary group 1994\u20132001, and Deputy Chairman of the Centre Party 2000\u20132003.\n\nAnother important topic for Vanhanen was [[Foreign relations of Finland|Finland's foreign and security policy]]. As a specialist on the [[European Union]] he was a member of the [[Convention on the Future of Europe|European Union Constitutional Convention]]. There he criticised the president of the convention, former French president [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]], as [[authoritarian]]. Vanhanen has said<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suomenkuvalehti.fi/?id=5835 |title=Suomenkuvalehti.fi |publisher=Suomenkuvalehti.fi |date=12 March 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref> that he is unenthusiastic about European co-operation, and that he is an \"EU pragmatist\", so he may be considered a [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptic]], especially when compared to his EU-enthusiast predecessor [[Paavo Lipponen]].\n\n===Vanhanen's first cabinet===\nVanhanen resigned from the Constitutional Convention in 2003 when he became Minister of Defense in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Anneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki]]. After J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki's resignation, Vanhanen [[Matti Vanhanen's first cabinet|was elected Prime Minister]] and [[Matti Vanhanen's first cabinet|his first cabinet]] was formed.\n\nAs a politician, Vanhanen is considered to be part of the liberal wing of the old agrarian Central Party, along with the two other Party ministers from [[Uusimaa|Uusimaa region]]. His government cut the top state income tax rate from 35.5% to 33.5% in 2005 and 32.5% in 2006 (resulting in approximately 55% total tax rate after local government and social security taxes). The corporate tax rate was also lowered to 26% and capital gains to 28% (both formerly 29%), though at the same time dividends were partially made taxable. Vanhanen has said he is willing to continue tax cuts.\n\n===Presidential candidate===\n[[File:World leaders at the 32nd G8 Summit, Strelna, Russia - 20060716.jpg|thumb|right|Vanhanen after [[2006 Finnish presidential election|Finnish 2006 presidential elections]] in G8 Summit in [[Strelna]], Russia. Left to right: [[Romano Prodi]], [[Angela Merkel]], [[Tony Blair]], [[Jacques Chirac]], [[Vladimir Putin]], [[George W. Bush]], [[Junichiro Koizumi]], [[Stephen Harper]], Matti Vanhanen and [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]].]]\nAs the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] candidate, Vanhanen challenged [[president of Finland|President]] [[Tarja Halonen]] in the 2006 [[2006 Finnish presidential election|Finnish presidential election]]. He received 18.6% of the vote, coming third to the [[National Coalition Party (Finland)|National Coalition Party]]'s [[Sauli Niinist\u00f6]] (24.1%) and [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrat]] and incumbent [[Tarja Halonen]] (46.3%), and thus did not qualify for the runoff. Vanhanen expressed his support for Niinist\u00f6 in the runoff election against his coalition partner's candidate Halonen.\n\nThe presidential election, and co-operation between Centre Party and National Coalition Party, proved to be a major strain on the government coalition between the Centre Party and Social Democrats. The flashpoint came in March, when the Centre Party demanded national [[Agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] to cover farmers' losses when the Finnish exception in the European Union's [[Common Agricultural Policy]] was about to expire. At the end of the crisis Vanhanen told his parliamentary group that taxpayers would cover ninety percent or about 100 million euros in losses.\n\n===Vanhanen's second cabinet===\n[[File:Vanhasen II hallitus.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Vanhanen's second cabinet.]]\nAfter the [[2007 Finnish parliamentary election|March 2007 election]] the Centre Party narrowly remained the largest party after losing four seats. However their coalition partner, the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|SDP]], lost eight seats and the centre-right [[National Coalition Party (Finland)|National Coalition Party]] gained ten. [[Matti Vanhanen's second cabinet|Vanhanen's second cabinet]] was formed on a centre-right basis, with minor partners the [[Green League]] and the [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]].\n\nA scandal involving Vanhanen's second cabinet began rolling in May 2008, after the leader of the Centre Party's parliamentary group [[Timo Kalli]] said publicly that he would not reveal information about his [[campaign finance]]s, because such disclosure was not required. After a media backlash, Kalli gave up his secrecy and listed a group of businessmen known as \"Kehittyvien maakuntien Suomi\" (KMS; in English, \"The Finland of Developing Regions\"), who had financed the Centre Party. Centre Party links with KMS were suspected, as one address of the organisation belonged to a party official. It was later revealed that the organisation had been formed in the Centre Party's general secretary's office.\n\nAfter the Russian response to the Georgian invasion of South Ossetia, Vanhanen said that Finland would rethink its security.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2008/08/vanhanen_finland_to_rethink_security_following_crisis_in_georgia_314968.html |title=Vanhanen: Finland to Rethink Security Following Crisis in Georgia |publisher=Yle.fi |accessdate=2010-06-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229204507/http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2008/08/vanhanen_finland_to_rethink_security_following_crisis_in_georgia_314968.html |archivedate=29 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nVanhanen's cabinet proposed raising the retirement age from 63 to 65 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/200902289164604_uu.shtml |title=Vanhanen: El\u00e4kei\u00e4n korotus l\u00e4hti minun aloitteestani |publisher=Iltalehti.fi |date=28 February 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/kotimaa.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2009/02/818706 |title=Vanhanen: El\u00e4kei\u00e4n nostolla maksetaan laman laskut |publisher=Mtv3.fi |date=25 February 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-5730671 |title=PM Vanhanen: \"Necessary to Raise Pension Age\" |publisher=Yle.fi |date=8 March 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23 }}</ref> His proposal was fiercely opposed by the [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions]] (Finnish acronym SAK), which is affiliated with the SDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taloussanomat.fi/tyomarkkinat/2009/03/02/sak--uhkaa-katkaista-valit-hallitukseen/20095555/12 |title=SAK uhkaa katkaista v\u00e4lit hallitukseen |publisher=Taloussanomat.fi |date=3 February 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2009, Vanhanen announced that he would step down as chair of the Centre Party at its June 2010 convention.
