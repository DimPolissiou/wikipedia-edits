{"title_page": "1923 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1923 season of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] was its 15th. The First Grade competition featured 7 teams with the Fire Brigade club who featured in it in 1922 not entering a team. Fire Brigade had originally been named [[Grafton Athletic]] and had formed in 1914.\n\n[[City Rovers]] won their 6th championship title and the 3rd in succession after defeating Athletic 8-7 in the final. With a round to play City was only 2 competition points ahead of Athletic so it was decided to play a final to decide the champions. The match was played on [[Carlaw Park]] in front of an enormous crowd of 11,500 with \u00a3325 received in gate takings<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championship Final/City Defeat Athletic/Great Contest For Honours\n| page =4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LX, Issue 18488\n| date = 1923-08-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19230827.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref>. City were the second team to win three consecutive titles after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] had won the competition in 1917, 1918, and 1919. It was to be 61 years until it happened again with [[Mt Albert Lions|Mt Albert]] winning the title from 1984-86 before [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] won 4 titles from 1991-94, [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] 3 titles from 1997-99, and [[Pt Chevalier Pirates|Pt Chevalier]] won 3 titles from 2013-15.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the second straight year and their third time in the competitions history after defeating [[City Rovers]] 14-3 in the final.\n\nThe Auckland representative team played 5 matches for 4 wins and a 20-20 draw. The draw was arguably the most significant result as it was in a match for the Northern Union Challenge Cup against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]]. Auckland had lost the cup to the same opposition the previous season and as the match was drawn South Auckland retained it. The two teams met again at the end of the season at Carlaw Park which Auckland won convincingly however the cup was not being played for as it was only defended at the holders home ground.\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1922 Auckland Rugby League season|1922]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=15th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1923}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n        {{end}}\n===Manukau Rugby League Team===\nNear the end of the season the Manukau and Mangere clubs sent a letter to the Auckland Rugby League which was read at the management committee meeting on August 29. It stated that the two clubs had decided to amalgamate and would enter a team in the senior grade the following year provided permission was granted, which it was. The Manukau club is the [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau]] club of today, though the Mangere club is not related to the modern day [[Mangere East Hawks|Mangere East]] who were not founded until 1963. They were located predominantly in the Onehunga area before moving much later to their current location at Moyle Park.\n\n== First Grade Championship  ==\nThe 1923 First Grade Championship was arguably the most keenly fought in the competitions history to this point with three teams in the hunt for the title up until the last two weeks. [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] who were in a good position to win the title lost in the 12th and 13th rounds and bowed out of contention, leaving [[City Rovers]] and Athletics to contend. It was ultimately won by [[City Rovers]] who finished the season with a 10 win and 2 loss record, as did Athletic, with a final being required to determine the winner. City won by the narrowest of margins 8-7 to go back to back.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|13||12||0||1||231||69||'''24'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Athletic\n|13||10||0||3||180||87||'''20'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]\n|12||9||0||2||170||111||'''18'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Rugby Football Club|Devonport United]]\n|12||5||0||7||131||144||'''10'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]\n|12||4||0||8||118||179||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|12||2||0||10||88||182||'''4'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]]\n|12||1||0||11||93||239||'''2'''\n|-\n|}\n\nA final was played between [[City Rovers]] and Athletic after the round robin to decide the title with City winning 8 points to 7 in front of 11,500 spectators at Carlaw Park.\n\n=== First Grade Fixtures ===\nThe First Grade season was particularly close right until the end. In the final round the step was made to play both games on [[Carlaw Park]] number 1 field for the first time (usually one match was always played on the number 2 field at the same time). If Athletics had defeated [[City Rovers]] in the main match they would have won the championship for the first time however they lost to [[City Rovers|City]] which forced a final to be played the following week between the same two teams and [[City Rovers|City]] were again victorious to claim their 3rd straight championship.\n\n===Round 1===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 5 May\n| time =

It was to be 61 years until it happened again with [[Mt Albert Lions|Mt Albert]] winning the title from 1984-86 before [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] won 4 titles from 1991-94, [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] 3 titles from 1997-99, and [[Pt Chevalier Pirates|Pt Chevalier]] won 3 titles from 2013-15.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the second straight year and their third time in the competitions history after defeating [[City Rovers]] 14-3 in the final.\n\nThe Auckland representative team played 5 matches for 4 wins and a 20-20 draw. The draw was arguably the most significant result as it was in a match for the Northern Union Challenge Cup against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]]. Auckland had lost the cup to the same opposition the previous season and as the match was drawn South Auckland retained it. The two teams met again at the end of the season at Carlaw Park which Auckland won convincingly however the cup was not being played for as it was only defended at the holders home ground.\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1922 Auckland Rugby League season|1922]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=15th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1923}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n        {{end}}\n===Manukau Rugby League Team===\nNear the end of the season the Manukau and Mangere clubs sent a letter to the Auckland Rugby League which was read at the management committee meeting on August 29. It stated that the two clubs had decided to amalgamate and would enter a team in the senior grade the following year provided permission was granted, which it was. The Manukau club is the [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau]] club of today, though the Mangere club is not related to the modern day [[Mangere East Hawks|Mangere East]] who were not founded until 1963. They were located predominantly in the Onehunga area before moving much later to their current location at Moyle Park.\n\n== First Grade Championship  ==\nThe 1923 First Grade Championship was arguably the most keenly fought in the competitions history to this point with three teams in the hunt for the title up until the last two weeks. [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] who were in a good position to win the title lost in the 12th and 13th rounds and bowed out of contention, leaving [[City Rovers]] and Athletics to contend. It was ultimately won by [[City Rovers]] who finished the season with a 10 win and 2 loss record, as did Athletic, with a final being required to determine the winner. City won by the narrowest of margins 8-7 to go back to back.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|13||12||0||1||231||69||'''24'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Athletic\n|13||10||0||3||180||87||'''20'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]\n|12||9||0||2||170||111||'''18'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Rugby Football Club|Devonport United]]\n|12||5||0||7||131||144||'''10'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]\n|12||4||0||8||118||179||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|12||2||0||10||88||182||'''4'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]]\n|12||1||0||11||93||239||'''2'''\n|-\n|}\n\nA final was played between [[City Rovers]] and Athletic after the round robin to decide the title with City winning 8 points to 7 in front of 11,500 spectators at Carlaw Park.\n\n=== First Grade Fixtures ===\nThe First Grade season was particularly close right until the end. In the final round the step was made to play both games on [[Carlaw Park]] number 1 field for the first time (usually one match was always played on the number 2 field at the same time). If Athletics had defeated [[City Rovers]] in the main match they would have won the championship for the first time however they lost to [[City Rovers|City]] which forced a final to be played the following week between the same two teams and [[City Rovers|City]] were again victorious to claim their 3rd straight championship.\n\n===Round 1===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 5 May\n| time =

[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] received a bye in the semi-finals and met Athletic in the final who they defeated 5 points to 0.\n\nThe following weekend another seven-a-side tournament was held at [[Carlaw Park]] to raise money for the Takapuna Orphanage which was destroyed by fire. Unfortunately the weather was particularly bad in the morning which had an effect on the attendance with only 1,000 spectators.

They started the season with a match against Wellington in which they ran up a huge score, winning by 71 points to 12. Their second match was played mid week against Hamilton, before two games against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] and finishing the season with a game against an Auckland provincial team.\n\nAuckland challenged [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] for the Northern Union Cup which it had lost to the same opponents in 2022. The match was drawn and so [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] retained the cup. Auckland later played an Auckland provincial team and won comfortably in front of 7,000 spectators on [[Carlaw Park]]. A curtain-raiser was played between the Referees Association and the Junior Advisory Board, and was won by the former by 10 points to 6.

Many Sikhs in Britain have insisted on their right of not conforming to the Khalsa norms while maintaining that they are truly Sikh. On the other hand, some of the Khalsa Sikhs think of the non-Khalsa Sikhs as having abandoned the Sikh faith altogether. A 3HO sect is a western group that emerged in 1971, founded by Harbhajan Singh also known as Yogi Bhajan. It requires both men and women to wear turbans, and adopt the surname Khalsa.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Parsons\n| first = Gerald\n| title = The Growth of Religious Diversity: Britain from 1945\n| year = 1994\n| publisher = Routledge\n| isbn = 978-0415083263\n| oclc = 29957116\n| pages = 231\n}}</ref>\n\nEach year the Khalsa display their military skills around the world at a festival called [[Hola Mohalla]].

This has been deemed necessary due to the rising persecution of the rulers. Before joining the Khalsa, most of the people were from professions like farming, pottery, masonry, carpenters, [[Labana]]s, etc.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh in Oct 1708 deputed his disciple [[Banda Singh Bahadur]] to lead the Khalsa in an uprising against the Mughals. Banda Singh Bahadur first established a Sikh kingdom and then brought in the Land reforms in the form of breaking up large estates and distributing the land to peasants. He and his comrades were eventually defeated and executed, but he became an icon among the Sikhs. After a long exile the Khalsa regrouped under [[Nawab Kapur Singh]], who gathered local Khalsa leaders and created ''[[Dal Khalsa (Sikh Empire)|Dal Khalsa]]'', a coalition army. The Dal Khalsa fought against the Mughals and the Afghans, eventually resulting in the establishment of a number of small republics called [[misl]]s (autonomous confederacies) and later in the formation of the [[Sikh Empire]].\n\nAfter the fall of the Mughal empire and the later establishment of the Sikh Empire in Punjab, the Khalsa was converted into a strong, multireligious and multinational fighting force, modernized according to European principles: the [[Sikh Khalsa Army]] which had a huge role in the expansion of the empire. Led by generals like: [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] himself, [[Misr Diwan Chand]] and [[Hari Singh Nalwa]]. It successfully defeated all its adversaries, including the Afghan tribals and army, Hill Chiefs, [[Misl|Misldars,]] Chinese, Tibetan and [[Gurkha]]s. By the time of death of [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] in 1839, the whole army of [[Sikh Empire]] was assessed at 120,000 men, with 250 artillery pieces.

According to Sainapti, while creating the Khalsa, Guru Gobind Singh said that ''bhaddar'' is ''bharam'' (illusion), and not ''[[dharma|dharam]]''.<ref name=\"JeevanDeol Identity\"/>\n\nTensions developed between the Punjabi [[Khatri]] disciples of the Guru in Delhi, and members of the newly formed Khalsa. A prominent Khatri disciple was expelled from the place of worship (''dharmasala'') for refusing to join the Khalsa. Another disciple was expelled for eating with him, starting a chain of further expulsions.<ref name=\"JeevanDeol Identity\"/> The expelled disciples convened a community gathering, at which two wealthy Khatris demanded that the Khalsa produce a written order from the Guru that a new mandatory code of conduct had been promulgated. A Khatri family that refused to follow the ''bhaddar'' ritual was boycotted by the Khatri community.<ref name=\"JeevanDeol Identity\"/> The Khatri council ([[panchayat|panch]]) closed the bazaar to pressure the Khalsa. The Khalsa petitioned the state officials to intervene, who forced reopening of the shops. Later, peace was established between the two groups in a ''sangat'' (congregation). However, hostility between some Khatris and the Khalsa persisted in the later years.<ref name=\"JeevanDeol Identity\"/>\n\n==Contemporary status==\n[[File:Communal lunch in Keshgarh Sahib.jpg|thumb| Khalsa principles of [[Deg Tegh Fateh|Deg]] to cook food ([[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]]) in huge amount]]\n\nToday, the Khalsa is respected by the entire gamut of Sikhs; however, not all Sikhs are Amritdharis<ref name=\"Cynthia Mahmood Faith Baisakhi\"/> The issue of Khalsa code of conduct has led to several controversies. In the early 1950s, a serious split occurred in the [[Sikh diaspora|Canadian Sikh community]], when the [[Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver|Khalsa Diwan Society]] in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]] elected a clean-shaven Sikh to serve on its management committee.<ref name=\" PRMagocsi Canada\">{{cite book|editor=Paul Robert Magocsi |title=Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples |origyear=1998 |year=1999 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-0802029386 |oclc=56300149 |pages=1157}}</ref> Although most of the early Sikh immigrants to Canada were non-Khalsa, and a majority of the members of the society were clean-shaven non-Khalsa Sikhs, a faction objected to the election of a non-Khalsa to the management committee. The factions in Vancouver and [[Victoria, British Columbia]] broke away from the Khalsa Diwan Society and established their own gurdwara society called Akali Singh.<ref name=\"PRMagocsi Canada\"/>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there have been tensions between the Khalsa Sikhs and the non-Khalsa Sikhs. Many Sikhs in Britain have insisted on their right of not conforming to the Khalsa norms while maintaining that they are truly Sikh. On the other hand, some of the Khalsa Sikhs think of the non-Khalsa Sikhs as having abandoned the Sikh faith altogether. A 3HO sect is a western group that emerged in 1971, founded by Harbhajan Singh also known as Yogi Bhajan. It requires both men and women to wear turbans, and adopt the surname Khalsa.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Parsons\n| first = Gerald\n| title = The Growth of Religious Diversity: Britain from 1945\n| year = 1994\n| publisher = Routledge\n| isbn = 978-0415083263\n| oclc = 29957116\n| pages = 231\n}}</ref>\n\nEach year the Khalsa display their military skills around the world at a festival called [[Hola Mohalla]].

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941 and [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I of Germany]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) appointed him as [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He was subsequently married to [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters, in 947 and became one of the king's closest allies. The relationship was strained, however, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had conducted with the rebellious [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], which he saw as threatening his own power. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto, but the rebellion was defeated and Conrad was stripped of his duchy. Conrad and Otto were soon reconciled, with Conrad fighting for Otto in the great [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955. Though the Germans were successful in halting the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]], Conrad lost his life in the battle. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], a grandson of Otto I. Sometime between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' oldest son, [[Henry of Speyer]], was born. Little is known of his life as he died the age of 20 between 985 and 990. Conrad II's father was [[Henry of Speyer]], and his mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]], an area of [[Upper Lorraine]].

Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his position at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded so as not to diminish his rank. Otto of Worms remained loyal to the new Emperor, receiving rulership of the [[March of Verona]] in 955, though the actual Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III appointed Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV were candidates for election as King of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany'', in return. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his holdings in Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival. Buchard assumed care for Conrad, providing his education and upbringing by 1000.\n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]], the elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by Emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy.

Gisela was first married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]]. By the marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] at the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. This marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].\n\nConrad II's hopes of obtaining his own duchy failed, but his marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and her father. The marriage was problematic because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad: both were descendants of [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian King]] [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]], Henry in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was not allowed among relatives of the first to seventh generations. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists took exception to the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] used this breach of canonical law to force Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017. Conrad and Emperor Henry II were eventually reconciled, allowing him to return to Germany.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Reign as King==\n\n===Royal election===\nEmperor Henry II died in 1024. Childless, Henry's death brought the [[Ottonian dynasty]], which had ruled Germany since 919, to an end. Without a clear successor as [[King of Germany]], Henry's widow [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] served as regent while the German dukes gathered to elect a new king. Cunigunde was assisted by her brothers [[Dietrich I of Metz|Bishop Dietrich I of Metz]] and [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]].

The [[Duchy of Saxony]] adopted a neutral strategy while the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] favored the younger Conrad. A majority of the assembled princes favored the elder Conrad, as the father of a seven-year-old son implied a more stable dynastic future for the kingdom. As president of the assembly, Archbishop Aribo cast the first vote and supported the elder Conrad. He was joined by the other clerics in support of him. The secular dukes then cast their votes for the elder Conrad as well.

The duchies of Saxony and Lorraine were in opposition to his rule, as well as his cousin Conrad of Carinthia. To secure his reign, Conrad went on a tour of Germany, making stops in [[Augsburg]] to receive the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]], and at [[Strasbourg]] to receive the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]], the brothers of the late Emperor Henry II. Both were appointed to high-ranking offices at Conrad's court. Traveling from Cologne to [[Aachen]], the site of Charlemagne's old capital, Conrad continued the tradition of claiming the right to rule Germany as successor to Charlemagne. Despite the continuance of this Ottonian tradition, the Duchy of Lorraine still did not accept his rule. Conrad then traveled north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both daughters of the late Ottonian [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. Their support of Conrad's rule greatly influenced the Saxony nobility. Celebrating [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], recognized Conrad as their king after he promised he would respect Saxon law. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony during the winter until March 1025. Upon leaving Saxony, Conrad traveled to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]]. He then traveled to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] to celebrate [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad next traveled to [[Zurich]] near the German-Burgundian border. In 1016, Emperor Henry II forced the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir. With Henry's death in 1024, Conrad claimed the same rights over Burgundy. This ended his tour of Germany, visiting all major regions of the kingdom within ten months of his election.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad had to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' upon assuming the German throne. The forty-year conflict stretched back to 989, during the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]], over control of [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, including the authority to anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III eased the tensions between the parties by declaring that both bishops would anoint the Abbess, the conflict continued. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], sought to overturn this precedent. Conrad was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election and worked to support his ally. In January 1027, the king called a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to resolve the dispute, but a conclusion was not reached. Conrad called a second synod in September 1028, which likewise failed to find a solution. Only a third synod in 1030 ended the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims to the monastery in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04818-2|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his travel to Augsburg, a conflict broke out between Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]]. The reasons for the dispute are not clear, however, the younger Conrad claimed he did not receive the compensation the king had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men might have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 as Conrad the Younger had ceased to oppose Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=20}}\n\n===Unrest in Italy===\n[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]\nIn Bavaria, Conrad was brought into contact with the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], and other bishops from [[Northern Italy]], traveled north over the Alps to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain privileges in the governing of Italy, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]].{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}} The situation in Italy was unstable after the death of the Henry II. The secular nobles believed the Italian throne to be vacant, not accepting Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles offered the Italian crown to the  [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After he rejected the offer, the secular lords approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]]. Though initially excited by the offer, William V subsequently rejected it as well.\n\nIn addition to the ecclesiastical mission, secular Italian nobles from [[Pavia]] also traveled north to Conrad. While Conrad's election did not meet significant obstacles north of the Alps, in Italy, in the aftermath of the death of [[Emperor Henry II]], there were several riots, and some Italian nobles attempted to separate the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When the news spread of Henry's death, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted, destroying the imperial palace, which dated to the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]] during the 5th century. Though Pavia had lost is position as the seat of royal administration in Italy under the Ottonian dynasty, the palace had been a great symbol of imperial authority in Italy. Pavia, thanks to its strategic location situated on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France, had become an important commercial center. Traders of the lower nobility demanded greater autonomy from imperial control. The nobility saw the mere presence of the imperial palace within the city walls intolerable.<ref name=boni>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/40250313/Reconsidering_Donizone_s_Vita_Mathildis_again_Boniface_of_Canossa_and_the_Emperor_Conrad_II |title= Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III  |publisher= Academiaa  | date=July 24, 2017 | author=Robert Houghton | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAmbassadors from Pavia traveled north to meet with the German king. According to Conrad's personal cleric Wipo, the Italian kingship was not \"durable\" with the German throne but instead a mere \"[[personal union]]\". Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity, not a permanent [[political union]]. They tried to justify the actions of their fellow citizens, claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Therefore, the burning of the palace should be excused. Conrad rejected their argument, however, saying that just as a ship remains after the death of its captain, the Empire remains after the death of the Emperor. The kingship of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to him as king of Germany as a matter of legal right. Conrad also declared that the palace was property of the Empire, not of the old king, and therefore the new king had the right to punish those responsible. The secular nobles returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled an army of thousands of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army marched south, besieging Pavia, but the city walls blocked the attackers. Conrad decided to leave a contingent of soldiers to keep the city under siege, blocking all trade in the area, and continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert became highest ranking religious figure in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad marched with his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers alongside the Ravennese population caused tension in the city. Conrad marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat posed to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the secular nobles of Italy voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Rudolph's attendance marked an improvement in the relationship between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the seven-day coronation ceremony, a rank dispute between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna arose, with Conrad deciding in favor of Milan. Following the synod, Conrad traveled south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the southern Italian states of [[Principality of Capua]], the [[Principality of Salerno]], and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees to reorganize the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the particular goal of bringing the church at [[Venice]] under Imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the Emperor resolved the dispute in favor of Old-Aquileia. The [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquleia]] [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him as Patriarch in 1020 during the Emperor's campaign to reassert his authority in Italy. Conrad's action placed the church at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.\n\nToward the end of May 1027, Conrad returned north to Germany to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. With the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] left vacant, Conrad asserted his right to name a next duke as a matter of [[royal prerogative]], taking the unprecedented decision of naming his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as Duke of Bavaria despite the existence of candidates with a better claim to the Duchy. Never before had the Bavarian Duchy passed to a non-member of the Bavarian ducal family.\n\nThe young prince assumed the Bavarian dignity on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree requiring an accounting of all imperial property in the duchy. This required the various counts and bishops to report to Conrad all property they possessed in their castles and abbeys that belonged to the Emperor. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, with the Emperor even claiming Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property left to her by her late husband Emperor Henry II) as belonging to him. Conrad's promotion of imperial authority over the ducal succession and his claims to property throughout Bavaria caused tension between him and the German aristocracy, who viewed Conrad's actions as infringing upon their privileges.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}} Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]]. Though Conrad favored Wazo to lead the German Church as Archbishop and Primate, Gisela convinced him to appoint Bardo instead.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n===Relations with Poland===\n\n====War with Mieszko====\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[Duchies of Poland|Duchy of Poland]] at its greatest extent under [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]] and his son [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]].]]\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] warred with [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] three times during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars from 1002 to 1018]]. In January 1018, Henry II and Boles\u0142aw I signed a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Bautzen]],<ref name=Knefelkamp123>Knefelkamp (2002), p. 125</ref> in which the Empire and Poland declared a permanent peace with Boles\u0142aw recognizing Henry II as his nominal feudal lord.<ref name=cmh>Previte-orton, pg. 451</ref> In return, Henry II granted to Boles\u0142aw lands on the Empire's eastern border. To seal the peace, Boles\u0142aw I, a widower, reinforced his dynastic bonds with the German nobility by marrying [[Oda of Meissen]], daughter of the Saxon Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]]. Otto went to Germany to seek Conrad's protection.\n\nConrad considered the assumption of the title \"king\" by Mieszko an act of war and a disregard of his imperial authority, but had to address domestic issues before marching against Mieszko. In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to assert German authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century. Located on the northeast border of Germany, the Lutici were the regular target of German aggression during the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] with [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subjugating many of the Slavic tribes beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031. Under the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Mieszko returned control over the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] and the [[March of Lusatia]] to the Empire.\n\n====Treaty of Merseburg====\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson-Krolowa Ryksa.jpg|thumb|left|19th century painting of king [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II's]] wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]] (Wojciech Gerson, 1891) ]]\nSoon after Mieszko concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by his half-brother [[Bezprym]]. When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref> With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], which stretched from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and promised protection against Polish aggression in return for incorporation. Jaromir ruled only a smaller territory, however, as Poland occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. In the civil war which followed, Meiszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Meiszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPoland was unable to stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Meiszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear to the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich was imprisoned in Bavaria but by 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.\n\nOldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew. Bretislaus was then installed as the new Duke of Bohemia by Conrad.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n====Hungary====\n\n[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=Equestrian statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Budapest|[[Equestrian statue]] of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King St. Stephen]], [[Budapest]], 1905]]\nWith Otto III's approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian [[king of Hungary]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1000.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Otto III's successor, [[Emperor Henry II]], was Stephen's brother-in-law by Stephen's marriage to Henry's sister [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary.

Conrad left matters in Hungary to his son Henry, so he could address his problems with his stepson [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]], the deposed [[Duke of Swabia]]. Henry settled the conflict by 1031 by granting lands between the [[Leitha River]] and [[Fischa River]] in eastern Bavaria to Hungary. Hungary and the Empire remained at peace from 1031 through to Henry's own reign as Emperor in 1040.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 149-150}}\n\n===Conquest of Burgundy===\nAs in 1016 King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] was left without a male heir, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] seized the opportunity and forced King Rudolph III to name him - Henry his royal successor.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=16}} Henry II, the son of Rudolph's sister [[Gisela of Burgundy]] was his nephew, and his closest living male relative. However, Rudolph was still alive when Henry II died in 1024. Soon emperor Conrad II, as Henry II's imperial successor claimed he is also entitled to Henry II's rights on the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute. Henry II's widowed wife, Empress [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], mediated between the two parties.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} An agreement was reached that allowed Conrad II to succeed to the Burgundian throne upon Rudolph's death under the same conditions as Henry II.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} In return, Rudolph was allowed to retain independent rule over his kingdom.\n\nRudolph died on September 6, 1032, while Conrad was on campaign against [[Mieszko II Lambert|Duke Mieszko II of Poland]]. Upon Mieszko's  surrender, Conrad marched his army to Burgundy during the winter of 1032/1033. Conrad's rival to the Burgundian throne, Count Odo II of Blois had already invaded the kingdom to secure his rule and controlled large sections of the kingdom's western territories.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=30}} On February 2, 1033, Conrad arrived at [[Vaud]], where he held an assembly at the [[Payerne Priory|Abbey of Payerne]] and was crowned King of Burgundy.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}} Initially, Conrad made little progress against Odo and had to withdraw to [[Zurich]] in March.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}}  In two large-scale military summer campaigns in 1033 and 1034, Conrad defeated Odo.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}} On August 1, 1034, Conrad officially incorporated Burgundy into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at a ceremony held in the [[St. Pierre Cathedral|Cathedral of Geneva]].{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}}\n\nThough Burgundy had been brought under full imperial control, the kingdom was allowed a remarkable degree of autonomy. Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire. With Burgundy secured, Conrad controlled the western Alpine passes into Italy and block foreign invasions.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=40}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Conrad II et prince imp\u00e9rial, vitrail roman, Cath\u00e9drale de Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Conrad II, 12th-century stained glass depiction, [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]]]\n[[Image:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|Salian family tree]]\n\nConrad formally confirmed the popular [[legal]] traditions of [[Saxony]] and issued new constitutions for [[Lombardy]]. In 1028 at [[Aachen]], he had his son Henry elected and anointed king of [[Germany]]. Henry married [[Gunhilda of Denmark]], daughter of King [[Canute the Great]] of [[England]], [[Denmark]], and [[Norway]] by [[Emma of Normandy]]. This was an arrangement that Conrad had made many years prior, when he gave Canute parts of northern Germany to administer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Henry, who would later become Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], became his father's chief counselor.\n\nConrad campaigned unsuccessfully against [[Poland]] in 1028\u20131030. In 1031, Conrad and the [[Kievan Rus']] forced King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]], son and heir of [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]], to make peace and return the land that Boles\u0142aw had taken from the Empire during the reign of Henry II. Mieszko II was compelled to give up his royal title, and for the remainder of his troubled rule became the Duke of Poland and Conrad's vassal.\n\nIn 1029 some [[Bavaria]]n border conflicts undermined the good relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]]. One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the [[bishop]] had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers.

Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]]. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of ''Prince'' on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]]. Conrad thus left the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'' firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=boni/>\n\n===Death===\nDuring the return to Germany a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of the troops.

of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1027 until his death in 1039. The first of a succession of four [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors, who reigned for one century until 1125, Conrad also served as [[King of Germany]] from 1024, [[King of Italy]] from 1026, and [[King of Burgundy|King of Burgundy (Arelat)]] from 1033.\n\nThe son of [[Franconia]]n count [[Henry of Speyer]] (also Henry of Worms) and [[Adelaide of Metz]] of the ''Matfriding dynasty'', that had ruled the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] from 959 until 972, Conrad inherited the titles of count of [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] during childhood after his father had died around the year 990. He extended his influence beyond his inherited lands, as he came into favor of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] of the kingdom. When the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|dynastic line]] was left without a successor after [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II's]] death in 1024, on September 4 an assembly of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial princes]] appointed the 34 year-old Conrad king (''Rex romanorum'').{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}}<ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\nConrad II largely continued the political course, the ''Renovatio regni Francorum'' of his [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessor Henry II regarding the role of the Church and the status and affairs of Italy. He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.<ref name=boni/><ref name=\"Blumenthal1988\">{{cite book|author=Uta-Renate Blumenthal|title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&pg=PA45|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1386-6|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941 and [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I of Germany]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) appointed him as [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He was subsequently married to [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters, in 947 and became one of the king's closest allies. The relationship was strained, however, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had conducted with the rebellious [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], which he saw as threatening his own power. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto, but the rebellion was defeated and Conrad was stripped of his duchy. Conrad and Otto were soon reconciled, with Conrad fighting for Otto in the great [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955. Though the Germans were successful in halting the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]], Conrad lost his life in the battle. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], a grandson of Otto I. Sometime between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' oldest son, [[Henry of Speyer]], was born. Little is known of his life as he died the age of 20 between 985 and 990. Conrad II's father was [[Henry of Speyer]], and his mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]], an area of [[Upper Lorraine]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman. After her remarriage, Adelaide demonstrated no close relationship with her son.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]] after deposing the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]] during the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his position at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded so as not to diminish his rank. Otto of Worms remained loyal to the new Emperor, receiving rulership of the [[March of Verona]] in 955, though the actual Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III appointed Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV were candidates for election as King of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany'', in return. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his holdings in Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival. Buchard assumed care for Conrad, providing his education and upbringing by 1000.\n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]], the elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by Emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy. Conrad the Younger was placed in Conrad's care.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\">{{cite book|author1=Lenelotte M\u00f6ller|author2=Hans Ammerich|title=Die Salier: 1024-1125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZd4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT3|date=1 December 2015|publisher=marixverlag|isbn=978-3-8438-0474-5|pages=3\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\n===Adulthood===\nConrad married [[Gisela of Swabia]], a twice widowed [[duchess]], in 1016.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Gisela was the daughter of [[Herman II of Swabia|Duke Herman II of Swabia]] who, in 1002, unsuccessfully claimed the German throne following [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]'s death, losing the election to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]]. Gisela was first married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]]. By the marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] at the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. This marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].\n\nConrad II's hopes of obtaining his own duchy failed, but his marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and her father. The marriage was problematic because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad: both were descendants of [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian King]] [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]], Henry in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was not allowed among relatives of the first to seventh generations. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists took exception to the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] used this breach of canonical law to force Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017. Conrad and Emperor Henry II were eventually reconciled, allowing him to return to Germany.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Reign as King==\n\n===Royal election===\nEmperor Henry II died in 1024. Childless, Henry's death brought the [[Ottonian dynasty]], which had ruled Germany since 919, to an end. Without a clear successor as [[King of Germany]], Henry's widow [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] served as regent while the German dukes gathered to elect a new king. Cunigunde was assisted by her brothers [[Dietrich I of Metz|Bishop Dietrich I of Metz]] and [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]]. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbiship Aribo of Mainz]], the [[Primate of Germany]], also assisted Cunigunde.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bmagon.html |title= Archbishop Aribo di Magonza  |publisher= Catholic-Hierarchy  | date=July 24, 2017 | author= | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Konr\u00e1d2.jpg|thumb|left|Conrad&nbsp;II, depicted in the Chronicle of [[Ekkehard von Aura]]]]\n\nOn September 4, 1024, the German princes gathered at ''Kamba'', a historical name for an area on the east banks of the [[Rhine River]] opposite the modern German town of [[Oppenheim]]. Now the location of ''Kamba'' is marked with a small equestrian statue of Conrad II. The chronicler and Conrad's [[chaplain]], [[Wipo of Burgundy]] attended the meeting and documented the event. Archbishop Aribo presided over the assembly. Conrad presented himself as a candidate for election, as did his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]].

The [[Duchy of Saxony]] adopted a neutral strategy while the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] favored the younger Conrad. A majority of the assembled princes favored the elder Conrad, as the father of a seven-year-old son implied a more stable dynastic future for the kingdom. As president of the assembly, Archbishop Aribo cast the first vote and supported the elder Conrad. He was joined by the other clerics in support of him. The secular dukes then cast their votes for the elder Conrad as well.

To secure his reign, Conrad went on a tour of Germany, making stops in [[Augsburg]] to receive the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]], and at [[Strasbourg]] to receive the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]], the brothers of the late Emperor Henry II. Both were appointed to high-ranking offices at Conrad's court. Traveling from Cologne to [[Aachen]], the site of Charlemagne's old capital, Conrad continued the tradition of claiming the right to rule Germany as successor to Charlemagne. Despite the continuance of this Ottonian tradition, the Duchy of Lorraine still did not accept his rule. Conrad then traveled north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both daughters of the late Ottonian [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. Their support of Conrad's rule greatly influenced the Saxony nobility. Celebrating [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], recognized Conrad as their king after he promised he would respect Saxon law. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony during the winter until March 1025. Upon leaving Saxony, Conrad traveled to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]]. He then traveled to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] to celebrate [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad next traveled to [[Zurich]] near the German-Burgundian border. In 1016, Emperor Henry II forced the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir. With Henry's death in 1024, Conrad claimed the same rights over Burgundy. This ended his tour of Germany, visiting all major regions of the kingdom within ten months of his election.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad had to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' upon assuming the German throne. The forty-year conflict stretched back to 989, during the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]], over control of [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, including the authority to anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III eased the tensions between the parties by declaring that both bishops would anoint the Abbess, the conflict continued. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], sought to overturn this precedent. Conrad was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election and worked to support his ally. In January 1027, the king called a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to resolve the dispute, but a conclusion was not reached. Conrad called a second synod in September 1028, which likewise failed to find a solution. Only a third synod in 1030 ended the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims to the monastery in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04818-2|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his travel to Augsburg, a conflict broke out between Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]]. The reasons for the dispute are not clear, however, the younger Conrad claimed he did not receive the compensation the king had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men might have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 as Conrad the Younger had ceased to oppose Conrad II.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\n===Unrest in Italy===\n[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]\nIn Bavaria, Conrad was brought into contact with the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], and other bishops from [[Northern Italy]], traveled north over the Alps to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain privileges in the governing of Italy, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]].{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}} The situation in Italy was unstable after the death of the Henry II. The secular nobles believed the Italian throne to be vacant, not accepting Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles offered the Italian crown to the  [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After he rejected the offer, the secular lords approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]]. Though initially excited by the offer, William V subsequently rejected it as well.\n\nIn addition to the ecclesiastical mission, secular Italian nobles from [[Pavia]] also traveled north to Conrad. While Conrad's election did not meet significant obstacles north of the Alps, in Italy, in the aftermath of the death of [[Emperor Henry II]], there were several riots, and some Italian nobles attempted to separate the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When the news spread of Henry's death, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted, destroying the imperial palace, which dated to the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]] during the 5th century. Though Pavia had lost is position as the seat of royal administration in Italy under the Ottonian dynasty, the palace had been a great symbol of imperial authority in Italy. Pavia, thanks to its strategic location situated on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France, had become an important commercial center. Traders of the lower nobility demanded greater autonomy from imperial control. The nobility saw the mere presence of the imperial palace within the city walls intolerable.<ref name=boni>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/40250313/Reconsidering_Donizone_s_Vita_Mathildis_again_Boniface_of_Canossa_and_the_Emperor_Conrad_II |title= Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III  |publisher= Academiaa  | date=July 24, 2017 | author=Robert Houghton | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAmbassadors from Pavia traveled north to meet with the German king. According to Conrad's personal cleric Wipo, the Italian kingship was not \"durable\" with the German throne but instead a mere \"[[personal union]]\". Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity, not a permanent [[political union]]. They tried to justify the actions of their fellow citizens, claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Therefore, the burning of the palace should be excused. Conrad rejected their argument, however, saying that just as a ship remains after the death of its captain, the Empire remains after the death of the Emperor. The kingship of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to him as king of Germany as a matter of legal right. Conrad also declared that the palace was property of the Empire, not of the old king, and therefore the new king had the right to punish those responsible. The secular nobles returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled an army of thousands of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army marched south, besieging Pavia, but the city walls blocked the attackers. Conrad decided to leave a contingent of soldiers to keep the city under siege, blocking all trade in the area, and continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert became highest ranking religious figure in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad marched with his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers alongside the Ravennese population caused tension in the city. Conrad marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat posed to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the secular nobles of Italy voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Conrad was crowned as Emperor on March 26, 1027, by [[Pope John XIX]].]]\nOn March 26, 1027, [[Pope John XIX]] crowned Conrad and his wife Gisela as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and Empress, respectively, in [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=102}} The coronation was attended by [[Cnut the Great|Cnut the Great, King of England, Denmark and Norway]], [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]] and 70 high-ranking clerics, including the Archbishops of Cologne, Mainz, Trier, Magdeburg, Salzburg, Milan, and Ravenna.{{sfn|Heer|1968|p=51}} Conrad's son and heir [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] also  attended. Rudolph's attendance marked an improvement in the relationship between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the seven-day coronation ceremony, a rank dispute between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna arose, with Conrad deciding in favor of Milan. Following the synod, Conrad traveled south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the southern Italian states of [[Principality of Capua]], the [[Principality of Salerno]], and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees to reorganize the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the particular goal of bringing the church at [[Venice]] under Imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the Emperor resolved the dispute in favor of Old-Aquileia. The [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquleia]] [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him as Patriarch in 1020 during the Emperor's campaign to reassert his authority in Italy. Conrad's action placed the church at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.\n\nToward the end of May 1027, Conrad returned north to Germany to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. With the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] left vacant, Conrad asserted his right to name a next duke as a matter of [[royal prerogative]], taking the unprecedented decision of naming his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as Duke of Bavaria despite the existence of candidates with a better claim to the Duchy. Never before had the Bavarian Duchy passed to a non-member of the Bavarian ducal family.\n\nThe young prince assumed the Bavarian dignity on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree requiring an accounting of all imperial property in the duchy. This required the various counts and bishops to report to Conrad all property they possessed in their castles and abbeys that belonged to the Emperor. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, with the Emperor even claiming Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property left to her by her late husband Emperor Henry II) as belonging to him. Conrad's promotion of imperial authority over the ducal succession and his claims to property throughout Bavaria caused tension between him and the German aristocracy, who viewed Conrad's actions as infringing upon their privileges.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}} Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]]. Though Conrad favored Wazo to lead the German Church as Archbishop and Primate, Gisela convinced him to appoint Bardo instead.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n===Relations with Poland===\n\n====War with Mieszko====\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[Duchies of Poland|Duchy of Poland]] at its greatest extent under [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]] and his son [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]].]]\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] warred with [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] three times during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars from 1002 to 1018]]. In January 1018, Henry II and Boles\u0142aw I signed a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Bautzen]],<ref name=Knefelkamp123>Knefelkamp (2002), p. 125</ref> in which the Empire and Poland declared a permanent peace with Boles\u0142aw recognizing Henry II as his nominal feudal lord.<ref name=cmh>Previte-orton, pg. 451</ref> In return, Henry II granted to Boles\u0142aw lands on the Empire's eastern border. To seal the peace, Boles\u0142aw I, a widower, reinforced his dynastic bonds with the German nobility by marrying [[Oda of Meissen]], daughter of the Saxon Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]]. Otto went to Germany to seek Conrad's protection.\n\nConrad considered the assumption of the title \"king\" by Mieszko an act of war and a disregard of his imperial authority, but had to address domestic issues before marching against Mieszko. In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to assert German authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century. Located on the northeast border of Germany, the Lutici were the regular target of German aggression during the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] with [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subjugating many of the Slavic tribes beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031. Under the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Mieszko returned control over the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] and the [[March of Lusatia]] to the Empire.\n\n====Treaty of Merseburg====\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson-Krolowa Ryksa.jpg|thumb|left|19th century painting of king [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II's]] wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]] (Wojciech Gerson, 1891) ]]\nSoon after Mieszko concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by his half-brother [[Bezprym]]. When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref> With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], which stretched from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and promised protection against Polish aggression in return for incorporation. Jaromir ruled only a smaller territory, however, as Poland occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. In the civil war which followed, Meiszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Meiszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPoland was unable to stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Meiszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear to the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich was imprisoned in Bavaria but by 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.\n\nOldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew. Bretislaus was then installed as the new Duke of Bohemia by Conrad.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n====Hungary====\n\n[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=Equestrian statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Budapest|[[Equestrian statue]] of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King St. Stephen]], [[Budapest]], 1905]]\nWith Otto III's approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian [[king of Hungary]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1000.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Otto III's successor, [[Emperor Henry II]], was Stephen's brother-in-law by Stephen's marriage to Henry's sister [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary. Under Conrad, however, relations quickly turned hostile as Conrad pursued a more aggressive policy regarding eastern Europe.{{sfn|Lenkey|2003|p = 90}} Conrad II expelled Venetian Doge [[Otto Orseolo]], the husband of Stephen's sister [[Grimelda of Hungary]], from Venice in 1026.{{sfn|Lenkey|2003|p = 90}}{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 148}} Conrad also persuaded the Bavarians to proclaim his own son, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], as their duke in 1027, although Stephen's son, [[Saint Emeric of Hungary|Emeric of Hungary]], had a strong claim to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] through his mother.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 187}}\n\nEmperor Conrad planned a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Empire and dispatched one of his advisors, Bishop [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Werner of Strasbourg]], to Constantinople.{{sfn|Butler|Cumming|Burns|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp = 197-198}} The bishop seemingly traveled as a pilgrim, but Stephen, who had been informed of his actual purpose, refused to let him enter into his country in the autumn of 1027.{{sfn|Butler|Cumming|Burns|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp = 197-198}} Conrad's biographer, [[Wipo of Burgundy]] recorded that the Bavarians incited skirmishes along the common Imperial-Hungarian border in 1029, causing a rapid deterioration in relations between the two countries.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 149}}{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|2003|p = 74}} In 1030, open conflict erupted. Conrad launched an invasion of Hungary, but had to retreat when the Hungarians successfully used [[scorched earth tactics]]. Conrad left matters in Hungary to his son Henry, so he could address his problems with his stepson [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]], the deposed [[Duke of Swabia]]. Henry settled the conflict by 1031 by granting lands between the [[Leitha River]] and [[Fischa River]] in eastern Bavaria to Hungary. Hungary and the Empire remained at peace from 1031 through to Henry's own reign as Emperor in 1040.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 149-150}}\n\n===Conquest of Burgundy===\nAs in 1016 King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] was left without a male heir, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] seized the opportunity and forced King Rudolph III to name him - Henry his royal successor.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=16}} Henry II, the son of Rudolph's sister [[Gisela of Burgundy]] was his nephew, and his closest living male relative. However, Rudolph was still alive when Henry II died in 1024. Soon emperor Conrad II, as Henry II's imperial successor claimed he is also entitled to Henry II's rights on the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute. Henry II's widowed wife, Empress [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], mediated between the two parties.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} An agreement was reached that allowed Conrad II to succeed to the Burgundian throne upon Rudolph's death under the same conditions as Henry II.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} In return, Rudolph was allowed to retain independent rule over his kingdom.\n\nRudolph died on September 6, 1032, while Conrad was on campaign against [[Mieszko II Lambert|Duke Mieszko II of Poland]]. Upon Mieszko's  surrender, Conrad marched his army to Burgundy during the winter of 1032/1033. Conrad's rival to the Burgundian throne, Count Odo II of Blois had already invaded the kingdom to secure his rule and controlled large sections of the kingdom's western territories.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=30}} On February 2, 1033, Conrad arrived at [[Vaud]], where he held an assembly at the [[Payerne Priory|Abbey of Payerne]] and was crowned King of Burgundy.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}} Initially, Conrad made little progress against Odo and had to withdraw to [[Zurich]] in March.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}}  In two large-scale military summer campaigns in 1033 and 1034, Conrad defeated Odo.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}} On August 1, 1034, Conrad officially incorporated Burgundy into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at a ceremony held in the [[St. Pierre Cathedral|Cathedral of Geneva]].{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}}\n\nThough Burgundy had been brought under full imperial control, the kingdom was allowed a remarkable degree of autonomy. Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire. With Burgundy secured, Conrad controlled the western Alpine passes into Italy and block foreign invasions.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=40}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Conrad II et prince imp\u00e9rial, vitrail roman, Cath\u00e9drale de Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Conrad II, 12th-century stained glass depiction, [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]]]\n[[Image:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|Salian family tree]]\n\nConrad formally confirmed the popular [[legal]] traditions of [[Saxony]] and issued new constitutions for [[Lombardy]]. In 1028 at [[Aachen]], he had his son Henry elected and anointed king of [[Germany]]. Henry married [[Gunhilda of Denmark]], daughter of King [[Canute the Great]] of [[England]], [[Denmark]], and [[Norway]] by [[Emma of Normandy]]. This was an arrangement that Conrad had made many years prior, when he gave Canute parts of northern Germany to administer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Henry, who would later become Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], became his father's chief counselor.\n\nConrad campaigned unsuccessfully against [[Poland]] in 1028\u20131030. In 1031, Conrad and the [[Kievan Rus']] forced King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]], son and heir of [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]], to make peace and return the land that Boles\u0142aw had taken from the Empire during the reign of Henry II. Mieszko II was compelled to give up his royal title, and for the remainder of his troubled rule became the Duke of Poland and Conrad's vassal.\n\nIn 1029 some [[Bavaria]]n border conflicts undermined the good relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]]. One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the [[bishop]] had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers. Conrad restored order with skillful diplomacy and luck.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Late life==\n\n===Securing the imperial succession===\nOn 14 January 1040 Conrad II's heir Henry issued a charter, in which he announced his official designation as of ''Rex romanorum'' - King of the Romans. Thus he effectively elevates the traditional Frankish kingship to Imperial authority. By this assignment only, one reserves the rights for the office of Holy Roman Emperor.<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\"/>\n\n===Second Italian expedition===\n[[Image:Grab Konrad II. im Dom zu Speyer.JPG|thumb|Emperor Conrad II's tomb in the crypt of [[Speyer Cathedral]], Germany]]\nIn 1038, Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] requested that Conrad adjudicate in a dispute over [[Capua]] with its Prince [[Pandulf IV of Capua|Pandulf]], whom Conrad had released from imprisonment in 1024, immediately after his coronation. Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]]. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of ''Prince'' on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]]. Conrad thus left the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'' firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=boni/>\n\n===Death===\nDuring the return to Germany a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of the troops. Conrad's daughter-in-law and stepson died. Conrad himself returned home safely and held court on important occasions in [[Solothurn]], [[Strasbourg]], and [[Goslar]]. His son Henry was invested with the duchies of Swabia and Carinthia.{{sfn|North|2001|p=143}}\n\nA year later in 1039 Conrad fell ill and died of [[gout]] in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 345}} His heart and bowels are buried at the [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 345-346}} His body was transferred to Speyer via [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], where the funeral procession made stops. His body is buried at Speyer Cathedral, which was still under construction at this time. During a major excavation in 1900 his sarcophagus was relocated from his original resting place in front of the altar to the crypt, where it is still visible today along with those of seven of his successors.\n\nA biography of Conrad II in chronicle form, ''Gesta Chuonradi II imperatoris'', was written by his chaplain [[Wipo of Burgundy]], and presented to Henry III in 1046, not long after he was crowned.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Family and children==\n{{see also|Kings of Germany family tree}}\nConrad married Gisela of Swabia in 1016, the daughter of Duke Herman II of Swabia.

She was the first of five children born to George Smith, and Ruth Chapman. George Smith was a soldier, having enlisted in the 2nd Regiment [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]] in December 1834. Chapman's parents were not married at the time of her birth, although they married on 22 February 1842, in Paddington. Following the birth of their second child in 1844, the family relocated to [[Knightsbridge]], where George Smith became a [[valet]].<ref>''Serial Killers and the Phenomenon of Serial Murder: A Student Textbook'' {{ISBN|978-1-909-97621-4}} p. 73</ref> The family eventually relocated to [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] in 1856.<ref>''Revelations of the True Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-411-69741-6}} p. 63</ref>\nHello\n[[Census]] records from 1861 indicate all members of the Smith family\u2014except Annie\u2014had relocated to the parish of [[Clewer]].

The marriage was witnessed by one of her sisters, Emily Laticia, and a colleague of her husband named George White.<ref name=shelden>'Annie Chapman: Jack the Ripper Victim A Short Biography'. Written and published by Neal Shelden (2001)</ref> Initially, the couple resided in Montpelier Place, [[Brompton, London|Brompton]], although in the years following their marriage, the Chapmans lived at various [[West London]] addresses. The couple had three children: Emily Ruth (b. 25 June 1870); Annie Georgina (b. 5 June 1873); and John Alfred (b. 21 November 1880). Emily Ruth was born at Chapman's mother's home in Monpelier Place, Knightsbridge; Annie Georgina was born at South Bruton Mews, [[Mayfair]]; and John Alfred was born in the [[Berkshire]] village of [[Bray, Berkshire|Bray]].<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Facts'' {{ISBN|978-1-909-39615-9}} ch. 6</ref> John was born [[cripple]]d,<ref>''Revelations of the True Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-411-69741-6}} p. 25</ref> leadng the Chapmans to seek medical help for their son at a London hospital before later placing him in the care of an institution for the physically disabled. Although Chapman had struggled with [[alcoholism]] as an adult, she had reportedly weaned herself off drink by 1880. Her son's disability is believed to have contributed to Chapman's reversion to [[alcohol dependency]].<ref>''London's Shadows: The Dark Side of the Victorian City'' {{ISBN|978-6-612-82171-4}} p. 163</ref>\n[[File:EmilyRuthChapmanAnnieChapmanDaughterc.1879a.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Emily Ruth Chapman.

The following year, Emily Ruth Chapman died of [[meningitis]] on her brother's second birthday at the age of 12.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia p29\" />\n\nFollowing the death of their daughter, both Chapman and her husband took to heavy drinking.<ref>''London's Shadows: The Dark Side of the Victorian City'' {{ISBN|978-6-612-82171-4}} p. 163</ref> Over the following years, she is known to have been arrested on several occasions for [[public intoxication]] in both Clewer and Windsor.<ref>''Complete Jack The Ripper'' {{ISBN|0-14-017395-1}} p. 39</ref> The couple separated by mutual consent in 1884,<ref name=shelden/> with John Chapman being obliged to pay his wife a weekly allowance of 10[[Shilling|s]] via Post Office Order. The precise reason for the couple's separation is unknown, although a later police report states the reason for the separation as Annie Chapman's \"drunken and [[Immorality|immoral]] ways\".<ref>''Revelations of the True Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-411-69741-6}} p. 63</ref>\n\nTwo years later, on 25 December 1886, John Chapman died of [[cirrhosis|liver cirrhosis]]<ref>''The News from Whitechapel: Jack the Ripper in the Daily Telegraph'' {{ISBN|978-0-786-41385-0}} p. 43</ref> and [[edema]], leading to the cessation of these weekly payments.<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'' {{ISBN|978-1-317-86633-6}} p. 188</ref> Chapman learned of her husband's death via her brother-in-law.<ref>''Revelations of the True Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-411-69741-6}} p. 63</ref>\n\n===Life in Whitechapel===\nFollowing her separation from her husband, Annie Chapman relocated to Whitechapel. Over the following years, she resided in [[common lodging-house]]s in both Whitechapel and Spitalfields.<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'' {{ISBN|0-582-50631-X}} p. 188</ref> In 1886, she is known to have resided with a man who made wire sieves for a living.

However, at the end of 1886, these payments abruptly stopped. Upon enquiring why these weekly payments had suddenly ceased, Chapman discovered her husband had died of alcohol-related causes. Shortly thereafter\u2014possibly due to the cessation of Chapman's inheritance\u2014this sieve-maker left Chapman. One of her friends later testified Chapman had subsequently become very [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] and generally seemed to abandon the [[Volition (psychology)|will]] to live.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/jack-the-ripper/crimes|title=The Man Who Shook a City|website=crimeandinvestigation.co.uk|accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of Chapman's death, her son John had been placed in the care of an institution for the physically disabled.<ref>''Jack the Ripper: From the Cradle to the Grave'' {{ISBN|978-1-481-79895-2}} p. 114</ref> Her surviving daughter, Annie Georgina, then an adolescent, was travelling with a circus in France.<ref name=shelden/>\n\n==1888==\nBy May or June of 1888, Chapman resided in Crossingham's Lodging House at 35 [[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]],<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'' {{ISBN|0-582-50631-X}} p. 188</ref> paying 8[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] a night for a double bed.

In the police records, however, she is identified as \"Long Mrs. alias Durrell\" (HO 144/221/A49301C f. 136, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 289).</ref> testified at the subsequent [[inquest]] into Chapman's murder that she had seen Chapman talking with a man at approximately 5:30 a.m. on 8 September. The two had stood just beyond the back yard of 29 [[Hanbury Street]], Spitalfields. Mrs. Long described the man as being over forty years of age, slightly taller than Chapman, with dark hair, and of a foreign, \"shabby-[[Gentry|genteel]]\" appearance.<ref name=begg153/> He was wearing a [[Deerstalker|deer-stalker hat]] and dark overcoat.<ref name=begg153>Begg, p. 153; Cook, p. 163; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 98; Marriott, pp. 59\u201375</ref> If Elizabeth Long was correct with regards to her identification of Chapman and the description of the individual in her company at the time of this sighting, it is likely she was the last person to see Chapman alive, and in the company of her murderer.<ref>''The Real Jack the Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-845-29182-2}} p. 369</ref>\n\n===Murder===\nShortly before 5:00&nbsp;a.m. on 8 September, the son of a resident of 29 Hanbury Street, John Richardson, entered the back yard of the property to trim a loose piece of leather from his boot.

Two brass rings Chapman is known to have worn were not recovered at the crime scene, either because she had [[Pawnbroker|pawned]] them or because they had been stolen.<ref>Fido, pp. 31\u201332</ref> All the pawnbrokers in the area were searched for the rings without success.<ref name=\"Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69\">Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69</ref> The envelope bore the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the [[Royal Sussex Regiment]], and was briefly believed could be traced to Edward Stanley, who is known to have falsely claimed to be an army veteran, in receipt of a pension. This lead of enquiry was abandoned after police discovered Chapman had wrapped the pills in this section of envelope at Crossingham's Lodging House just hours before her murder.<ref>Fido, p. 32</ref>\n\nContemporary press reports claimed that two [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]]s were also found in the yard of Hanbury Street, but these coins are not mentioned in the surviving police records.<ref name=\"Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69\"/> The local inspector of the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], [[Edmund Reid]] of H Division Whitechapel, was reported as mentioning these coins at an inquest in 1889, and the acting Commissioner of the City Police, Major Henry Smith, also mentioned them in his memoirs.<ref name=\"Fido, p. 31\"/> Smith's memoirs, however, are unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect, and were written more than twenty years after the event.<ref>Fido, pp. 50, 120</ref> Smith claimed medical students frequently polished farthings so they could be passed off as [[Sovereign (British coin)|sovereigns]] to unsuspecting prostitutes, and so the presence of the farthings suggested the culprit may have been a medical student. However, the price to solicit the services of an East End prostitute was as little as [[Fourpence (British coin)|4d]]\u2014much less than a sovereign.<ref name=\"Fido, p. 31\"/>\n[[File:Bagsterphillips2.jpg|thumb|230px|''[[Illustrated Police News]]'' sketch of Dr [[George Bagster Phillips]] examining the body of Annie Chapman at 29 Hanbury Street]]\nThe first officer on the scene was inspector Joseph Luniss Chandler of H Division, but Chief Inspector [[Donald Swanson]] of [[Scotland Yard]] was placed in overall command on 15 September.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 69, 85</ref> The murder was quickly linked to similar murders in the district, particularly to that of [[Mary Ann Nichols]] a week previously. Nichols had also suffered a slash to the throat and abdominal wounds, and a blade of similar size and design had been used.

On the wooden [[Palisade|paling]] between the yard in question and the next, smears of blood, corresponding to where the head of the deceased lay, were to be seen. These were about 14 inches from the ground, and immediately above the part where the blood from the neck lay.&nbsp;...\n\nThe instrument used at the throat and abdomen was the same. It must have been a very sharp knife with a thin narrow blade, and must have been at least 6 to 8 inches in length, probably longer. He should say that the injuries could not have been inflicted by a bayonet or a sword bayonet. They could have been done by such an instrument as a medical man used for post-mortem purposes, but the ordinary surgical cases might not contain such an instrument. Those used by the slaughtermen, well ground down, might have caused them. He thought the knives used by those in the leather trade would not be long enough in the blade. There were indications of anatomical knowledge&nbsp;... he should say that the deceased had been dead at least two hours, and probably more, when he first saw her; but it was right to mention that it was a fairly cool morning, and that the body would be more apt to cool rapidly from its having lost a great quantity of blood. There was no evidence&nbsp;... of a struggle having taken place. He was positive the deceased entered the yard alive&nbsp;...\n\nA handkerchief was round the throat of the deceased when he saw it early in the morning.

At the request of Chapman's family, the funeral was not publicised, with no mourning [[Coach (carriage)|coaches]] used throughout the service, and only the [[undertaker]], police, and her relatives knowing of these arrangements. Resultingly, her family members were the only mourners to attend the service.<ref>''Ripper Notes: Death in London's East End'' {{ISBN|978-0-975-91295-9}} p. 94</ref>\n\nA hearse supplied by Hanbury Street undertaker H.

Chapman's relatives met the hearse outside the cemetery.

Although Chapman had struggled with [[alcoholism]] as an adult, she had reportedly weaned herself off drink by 1880.

Shortly thereafter\u2014possibly due to the cessation of Chapman's inheritance\u2014this sieve-maker left Chapman.

Two brass rings Chapman is known to have worn were not recovered at the crime scene, either because she had [[Pawnbroker|pawned]] them or because they had been stolen.<ref>Fido, pp. 31\u201332</ref> All the pawnbrokers in the area were searched for the rings without success.<ref name=\"Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69\">Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69</ref> The envelope bore the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the [[Royal Sussex Regiment]], and was briefly believed could be traced to Edward Stanley, who is known to have falsely claimed to be an army veteran, in receipt of a pension. This lead of enquiry was abandoned after police discovered Chapman had wrapped the pills in this section of envelope at Crossingham's Lodging House just hours before her murder.<ref>Fido, p. 32</ref>\n\nContemporary press reports claimed that two [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]]s were also found in the yard of Hanbury Street, but these coins are not mentioned in the surviving police records.<ref name=\"Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69\"/> The local inspector of the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], [[Edmund Reid]] of H Division Whitechapel, was reported as mentioning these coins at an inquest in 1889, and the acting Commissioner of the City Police, Major Henry Smith, also mentioned them in his memoirs.<ref name=\"Fido, p. 31\"/> Smith's memoirs, however, are unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect, and were written more than twenty years after the event.<ref>Fido, pp. 50, 120</ref> Smith claimed medical students frequently polished farthings so they could be passed off as [[Sovereign (British coin)|sovereigns]] to unsuspecting prostitutes, and so the presence of the farthings suggested the culprit may have been a medical student. However, the price to solicit the services of an East End prostitute was as little as [[Fourpence (British coin)|4d]]\u2014much less than a sovereign.<ref name=\"Fido, p. 31\"/>\n[[File:Bagsterphillips2.jpg|thumb|230px|''[[Illustrated Police News]]'' sketch of Dr [[George Bagster Phillips]] examining the body of Annie Chapman at 29 Hanbury Street]]\nThe first officer on the scene was inspector Joseph Luniss Chandler of H Division, but Chief Inspector [[Donald Swanson]] of [[Scotland Yard]] was placed in overall command on 15 September.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 69, 85</ref> The murder was quickly linked to similar murders in the district, particularly to that of [[Mary Ann Nichols]] a week previously. Nichols had also suffered a slash to the throat and abdominal wounds, and a blade of similar size and design had been used. Swanson reported that an \"immediate and searching enquiry was made at all common lodging-houses to ascertain if anyone had entered that morning with blood on his hands or clothes, or under any suspicious circumstances\".<ref>Report of Superintendent Swanson, 19 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 68</ref> The body was conveyed later that day to Whitechapel mortuary in the same police ambulance, which was a handcart just large enough for one coffin, used for Nichols by Sergeant [[Edward Badham]].<ref>Marriott, p. 46</ref> Badham was the first to testify at the subsequent inquest.\n\n=== Inquest ===\nThe inquest was opened on 10 September at the Working Lad's Institute, Whitechapel, by local coroner [[Wynne Edwin Baxter]]. Evidence indicated that Chapman may have been killed as late as 5:30 a.m., in the enclosed back yard of a house occupied by sixteen people,<!--There were 17 residents but one was out at the time of the murder (Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 76)--> none of whom had seen or heard anything at the time of the murder.<ref>Coroner Baxter quoted in Marriott, p. 71</ref> The passage through the house to the back-yard was not locked, as it was frequented by the residents at all hours of the day, and the front door was wide open when the body was discovered.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 71</ref> Richardson said that he had often seen strangers, both men and women, in the passage of the house.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 78</ref> Dr [[George Bagster Phillips]], the police surgeon, described the body as he saw it at 6:30 a.m. in the back yard of the house at 29 Hanbury Street:\n{{quote|text=The left arm was placed across the left breast. The legs were drawn up, the feet resting on the ground, and the knees turned outwards. The face was swollen and turned on the right side. The tongue protruded between the front teeth, but not beyond the lips. The tongue was evidently much swollen. The front teeth were perfect as far as the first molar, top and bottom and very fine teeth they were. The body was terribly mutilated&nbsp;... the stiffness of the limbs was not marked, but was evidently commencing. He noticed that the throat was dissevered deeply; that the incision through the skin were jagged and reached right round the neck&nbsp;... On the wooden [[Palisade|paling]] between the yard in question and the next, smears of blood, corresponding to where the head of the deceased lay, were to be seen. These were about 14 inches from the ground, and immediately above the part where the blood from the neck lay.&nbsp;...\n\nThe instrument used at the throat and abdomen was the same. It must have been a very sharp knife with a thin narrow blade, and must have been at least 6 to 8 inches in length, probably longer. He should say that the injuries could not have been inflicted by a bayonet or a sword bayonet. They could have been done by such an instrument as a medical man used for post-mortem purposes, but the ordinary surgical cases might not contain such an instrument. Those used by the slaughtermen, well ground down, might have caused them. He thought the knives used by those in the leather trade would not be long enough in the blade. There were indications of anatomical knowledge&nbsp;... he should say that the deceased had been dead at least two hours, and probably more, when he first saw her; but it was right to mention that it was a fairly cool morning, and that the body would be more apt to cool rapidly from its having lost a great quantity of blood. There was no evidence&nbsp;... of a struggle having taken place. He was positive the deceased entered the yard alive&nbsp;...\n\nA handkerchief was round the throat of the deceased when he saw it early in the morning. He should say it was not tied on after the throat was cut.<ref>''The Times'', 14 September 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 85\u201388</ref>}}\n[[File:Annie Chapman mortuary photo.jpg|thumb|160px|Mortuary photograph of Annie Chapman]]\nChapman's throat had been cut from left to right so deeply the bones of her [[vertebral column]] bore striations,<ref>''Jack the Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-848-68522-2}} p. 158</ref> and she had been [[Disembowelment|disembowelled]], with a section of the flesh from her stomach being placed upon her left shoulder and another section of skin and flesh\u2014plus her [[small intestine]]s\u2014being removed and placed above her right shoulder.<ref>''The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970'' {{ISBN|978-0-863-79040-9}} pp. 55-56</ref> The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing.

Ship's cook William Henry Piggott was detained after being found in possession of a blood-stained shirt while making misogynist remarks. He claimed that he had been bitten by a woman, and the blood was his.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 83</ref> He was investigated, cleared and released.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 89</ref> Swiss butcher Jacob Isenschmidt matched the description of a blood-stained man seen acting strangely on the morning of the murder by a public house landlady, Mrs Fiddymont. His distinctive appearance included a large ginger moustache, and he had a history of mental illness. He was detained in a mental asylum. German hairdresser Charles Ludwig was arrested after he attempted to stab a man at a coffee stall shortly after attacking a prostitute. Isenschmidt and Ludwig were exonerated after another murder was committed while they were in custody.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 86\u201388</ref> Other suspects named in the police files and contemporary newspapers include Friedrich Schumacher, pedlar Edward McKenna, apothecary and mental patient Oswald Puckridge, and insane medical student John Sanders, but there was no evidence against any of them.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 80, 84, 88</ref>\n\nEdward Stanley was eliminated as a suspect as his alibis for the nights of two of the murders were confirmed.

She was laid to rest in a communal grave within Manor Park Cemetery, [[Forest Gate]], east London. At the request of Chapman's family, the funeral was not publicised, with no mourning [[Coach (carriage)|coaches]] used throughout the service, and only the [[undertaker]], police, and her relatives knowing of these arrangements. Resultingly, her family members were the only mourners to attend the service.<ref>''Ripper Notes: Death in London's East End'' {{ISBN|978-0-975-91295-9}} p. 94</ref>\n\nA hearse supplied by Hanbury Street undertaker H. Smith travelled to the Whitechapel Mortuary in Montague Street to collect Chapman's body at 7:00 a.m. Her body was placed in an [[elm]] coffin draped in black and was then driven to a Spitalfields undertaker named Harry Hawes, who arranged the funeral. Chapman's relatives met the hearse outside the cemetery.

His older brother, [[Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France|Louis Joseph]], died in June 1789, a little over a month before the start of the [[French Revolution]]. At his brother's death he became the [[heir apparent]] to the throne and the [[Dauphin of France]], a title he held until 1791, when the new constitution accorded the heir apparent the style of Prince Royal of France.\n\nWhen his father was executed on 21 January 1793, during the middle-period of the French Revolution, he became \"[[List of French monarchs|King of France]]\" in the eyes of the royalists. However, since France was by then [[First French Republic|a republic]], and Louis XVII had been imprisoned from August 1792 until his death from illness in 1795 at the age of 10, he  never actually governed. His title stems from monarchist theory, whereby [[The king is dead, long live the king!|there is always a monarch]]; on the death of one monarch, the [[heir apparent]] or failing that the [[heir presumptive]] are immediately monarch. His title was the reason why on his death his uncle took the regnal name of [[Louis XVIII of France]] rather than Louis XVII, retaining it upon the [[Bourbon Restoration]] in 1814.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Acte de bapt\u00eame de Louis Charles.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Baptismal certificate, [[Church of Notre-Dame, Versailles|Parish of Notre-Dame]]]]\nLouis-Charles de France was born at the [[Palace of Versailles]], the second son and third child of his parents, [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie-Antoinette]].<ref name=\":1\">{{EB1911|wstitle=Louis XVII. of France|volume=17|page=45}}</ref> He was named after his father and his mother's favourite sister [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Maria Carolina, Queen of Naples and Sicily]], who was known as Charlotte in the family, Charles being the masculine version of her name. His younger sister, [[Princess Sophie Helene Beatrice of France|Sophie]], was born a little over a year later. He became the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] on the death of his elder brother, Louis-Joseph, on 4 June 1789.\n\nAs customary in royal families, Louis-Charles was cared for by multiple people. Queen Marie Antoinette appointed governesses to look after all three of her children. Louis-Charles' original governess was [[Yolande de Polastron|Yolande de Polastron, ''duchesse de Polignac'']], who left France on the night of 16\u201317 July 1789, at the outbreak of the Revolution, at the urging of Louis XVI.<ref name=\":2\">Lever, Evelyne: ''Marie-Antoinette'', Fayard, Paris, 1991, p. 480</ref> She was replaced by the [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Cro\u00ff|marquise Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Tourzel]]. Additionally, the queen selected [[Agathe de Rambaud]] to be the official nurse of Louis-Charles. [[Alain Decaux]] wrote: <blockquote>\"Madame de Rambaud was officially in charge of the care of the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] from the day of his birth until [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]]; in other words, for seven years. During these seven years, she never left him, she cradled him, took care of him, dressed him, comforted him, and scolded him. Many times, more than Marie Antoinette, she was a true mother for him\".<ref>Alain Decaux, ''[[Louis XVII]] retrouv\u00e9'', 1947, p. 306.{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k73447w/f65.table|title=Gallica|publisher = BNF}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome have suggested that [[Axel von Fersen the Younger|Axel von Fersen]], who was romantically linked with Marie Antoinette, was the father of her son. The fact that Louis Charles was born exactly nine months after he returned to court was noted, but this theory was debunked by most scholars, who reject it, observing that the time of his conception corresponded perfectly in the time that Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had spent a lot of time together. Marie Antoinette, who gained massive weight because of her pregnancies, including this one (she was described as \"very fat\" by the king of Sweden), retained her charisma with an imposing figure in her court, where she had lot of admirers, but she remained a faithful, strong-willed wife and a stern but loving mother.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=180\u2013200, 305\u2013313}}</ref>{{citation needed|date:February 2020|date=February 2020}}\n\nOn 6 October 1789, the royal family was forced by a [[Women's March on Versailles|Parisian mob mostly composed of women]] to move from Versailles to the [[Tuileries Palace]] in [[Paris]], where they spent the next three years as prisoners under the daily surveillance of the national guards who did not spare any humiliation to the royal family; at that time Marie Antoinette was always surrounded by guards, even in her bedroom at night and these guards were present when the Queen was allowed to see her children.\n\nThe family lived a secluded life, and Marie Antoinette dedicated most of her time to her two children under the daily surveillance of the national guards who kept her hands behind her back and searched everybody from the Queen to the children to see if any letters were smuggled to the royal prisoner.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=350\u2013360}}</ref> On 21 June 1791, the family tried to escape in what is known as the [[Flight to Varennes]], but the attempt failed. After the family was recognized, they were brought back to Paris. When the Tuileries Palace was stormed by an armed mob on [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]], the royal family sought refuge at the Legislative Assembly.\n\nOn 13 August, the royal family was imprisoned in the tower of the [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]]. At first, their conditions were not extremely harsh, but they were prisoners and were re-styled as \"Capets\" by the newborn Republic. On 11 December, at the beginning of his trial, Louis XVI was separated from his family.\n\n===Naming===\nAt his birth, Louis-Charles, a ''[[Fils de France]]'' (\"Son of France\"), was given the title of [[Duke of Normandy]], and, on 4 June 1789, when [[Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France]], his elder brother, died, the four-year-old became [[Dauphin of France]], title he held until [[French Constitution of 1791|September 1791]], when France became a constitutional monarchy. Under the new constitution, the heir-apparent to the throne of France, formerly \"Dauphin\", was restyled ''Prince Royal''. Louis-Charles held that title until the [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|fall of the monarchy]] on 21 September 1792. At the death of his father on 21 January 1793, royalists and foreign powers intent on restoring the monarchy held him to be the new king of France, with the title of Louis XVII. From his exile in [[Hamm]], in today's [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], his uncle, the Count of Provence and future [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], who had emigrated on 21 June 1791, appointed himself [[Regent]] for the young imprisoned king.\n\n===Prison and rumours of escape===\n\n====1793: In care of Antoine Simon====\n[[File:Louis XVI au Temple, Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise - Vizille.jpg|thumb|''Louis XVI taking care of the education of his son in the [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]]'', ([[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]]).]]\nImmediately following Louis XVI's execution, plots were hatched for the escape of the prisoners from the Temple, the chief of which were engineered by the {{ill|Fran\u00e7ois Augustin Regnier de Jarjayes|lt=Chevalier de Jarjayes|fr}}, the [[Jean, Baron de Batz|Baron de Batz]], and [[Charlotte Atkyns|Lady Atkyns]]. All came to nothing.\n\nOn 3 July, Louis-Charles was separated from his mother and put in the care of [[Antoine Simon]], a [[Shoemaking|cobbler]] who had been named his guardian by the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and tasked to transform the former young prince into a staunch republican citizen.\n\nThe tales told by royalist writers of the cruelty inflicted by Simon and his wife on the child are not proven. Louis Charles' sister, Marie Therese, wrote in her memoires about the \"monster Simon\", as did Alcide Beauchesne. Antoine Simon's wife Marie-Jeanne, in fact, took great care of the child's person. Stories survive narrating how he was encouraged to eat and drink to excess and learned the language of the gutter. The foreign secretaries of Britain and Spain also heard accounts from their spies that the boy was raped by prostitutes in order to infect him with venereal diseases to supply the Commune with manufactured \"evidence\" against the Queen.<ref name=nagel /> However, the scenes related by {{ill|Alcide de Beauchesne|fr}} of the physical martyrdom of the child are not supported by any testimony, though he was at this time seen by a great number of people.\n\nOn 6 October, [[Jean-Nicolas Pache|Pache]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette|Chaumette]], [[Jacques H\u00e9bert]] and others visited him and secured his signature to charges of sexual molestation against his mother and his aunt.<ref name=nagel>{{cite book|last=Nagel|first=Susan|title=Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se: the fate of Marie Antoinette's daughter|year=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0-7475-9666-0|pages=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ydFDp1ZasMC }}</ref> The next day he met  with his elder sister [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-Charlotte]] for the last time.\n\n====1794: Illness====\nOn 19 January 1794, the Simons left the Temple, after securing a receipt for the safe transfer of their ward, who was declared to be in good health. A large part of the Temple records from that time onward disappeared under the [[Bourbon Restoration]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} making knowledge of the facts impossible. Two days after the departure of the Simons, Louis-Charles is said by the Restoration historians to have been put in a dark room which was barricaded like the cage of a wild animal. The story runs that food was passed through the bars to the boy, who survived despite the accumulated filth of his surroundings.\n\n[[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] visited Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se on 11 May, but no one, according to the legend, entered the dauphin's room for six months until [[Paul Fran\u00e7ois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]] visited the prison after the 9th Thermidor (27 July 1794). Barras's account of the visit describes the child as suffering from extreme neglect, but conveys no idea of the alleged walling in. It is nevertheless certain that during the first half of 1794 Louis-Charles was very strictly secluded; he had no special guardian, but was under the charge of guards who changed from day to day.\n\nThe boy made no complaint to Barras of any ill treatment. He was then cleaned and re-clothed. His room was cleaned, and during the day he was visited by his new attendant, [[Jean Jacques Christophe Laurent]] (1770\u20131807), a creole from [[Martinique]]. From 8 November onward, Laurent had assistance from a man named Gomin.\n\n[[File:Louis Charles of France2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Louis Charles by \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun]]\nLouis-Charles was then taken out for fresh air and walks on the roof of the Tower. From about the time of Gomin's arrival, he was inspected, not by delegates of the Commune, but by representatives of the civil committee of the 48 sections of Paris. The rare recurrence of the same inspectors would obviously facilitate fraud, if any such was intended. From the end of October onward, the child maintained an obstinate silence, explained by Laurent as a determination taken on the day he made his deposition against his mother. On 19 December 1794 he was visited by three commissioners from the Committee of Public Safety&nbsp;\u2014 [[Jean-Baptiste Harmand|J. B. Harmand de la Meuse]], [[Jean-Baptiste Charles Matthieu|J. B. C. Mathieu]] and [[Jacques Reverchon|J. Reverchon]]&nbsp;\u2014 who extracted no word from him.\n\n====1795: Death====\n[[File:Jeton sur la mort de louis XVII.jpg|thumb|Louis XVII]]\nOn 31 March 1795, [[\u00c9tienne Lasne]] was appointed to be the child's guardian in replacement of Laurent. In May 1795, the boy was seriously ill, and a doctor, [[P. J. Desault]], who had visited him seven months earlier, was summoned. However, on 1 June, Desault died suddenly, not without suspicion of poison, and it was some days before doctors [[Philippe-Jean Pelletan]] and [[Dumangin]] were called.\n\nLouis-Charles died on 8 June 1795. The next day an autopsy was conducted by Pelletan, at which it was stated that a child apparently about ten years of age, \"which the commissioners told us was the late Louis Capet's son\", had died of a [[scrofulous]] infection of long standing. \"Scrofula\" as it was previously known, is nowadays called ''[[Tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis]]'' referring to a [[lymphadenitis]] (chronic lymph node swelling or infection) of the neck ([[cervical lymph nodes]]) [[lymph node]]s associated with [[tuberculosis]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/100011836|tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nDuring the autopsy, the physician Dr. Pelletan was shocked to see the countless scars which covered the body of Louis-Charles.

Thus, the heart of Louis-Charles was not interred with the rest of the body. Dr. Pelletan stored the smuggled heart in distilled wine in order to preserve it. However, after 8 to 10 years the distilled wine had evaporated, and the heart was further kept dry.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the Restoration in 1815, Dr. Pelletan attempted to give the heart to Louis-Charles's uncle, [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]; the latter refused because he could not bring himself to believe that was the heart of his nephew. Dr. Pelletan then donated the heart to the [[Archbishop of Paris]], [[Hyacinthe-Louis de Qu\u00e9len]].\n\nFollowing the [[July Revolution|Revolution of 1830]], and the plundering of the palace, the son of Pelletan found the relic in the remnants of the palace and placed it in the crystal urn, in which it still resides today. After his death in 1879, Eduard Dumont received the heart.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1895, the nephew of the [[Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este (1817\u20131886)|Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este]], [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Don Carlos de Bourbon]], a pretender to the throne of Spain accepted the relic from a friend of Eduart Dumont, Paul Cottin. The relic was held near [[Vienna|Vienna, Austria]] at the castle of [[Frohsdorf]]. The son of Carlos, [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid]], in 1909 inherited the heart, and gave it to his sister, [[Infanta Beatriz of Spain|Beatriz]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFinally two granddaughters of Don Carlos offered the heart to the president of the Memorial of [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint-Denis]] in Paris, Duc de Bauffremont, where he put the heart and its crystal urn in the necropolis of the Kings of France, the burial place of Louis-Charles's parents and other members of the [[Capetian dynasty|French royal family]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn December 1999, public notaries witnessed a section of the heart muscle of the aorta removed from the rest of the heart, and the transfer of the samples into a sealed envelope, and then the opening of the sealed envelope in the laboratory to be tested. Scientists using DNA samples from [[Queen Anne of Romania]], and her brother Andre de Bourbon-Parme, maternal relatives of Louis XVII, and from a strand of Marie-Antoinette's hair, thus proved the young royal's identity.

When the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Bourbon monarchy was restored]] in 1814, some one hundred claimants came forward. Would-be royal heirs continued to appear across Europe for decades afterward and some of their descendants still have small but loyal retinues of followers today. Popular candidates for the Lost Dauphin included [[John James Audubon]], the naturalist; [[Eleazer Williams]], a missionary from [[Wisconsin]] of [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] descent; and [[Karl Wilhelm Naundorff]], a German clockmaker. However, DNA testing conducted in 1993 proved that Naundorff was not the Dauphin.<ref>Frasier, Antonia (2001), ''Marie Antoinette: The Journey''</ref>\n\n===Naundorff===\nKarl Wilhelm Naundorff's story rested on a series of complicated intrigues. According to him, [[Paul Fran\u00e7ois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]] determined to save the dauphin in order to please [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]],{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} the future empress, having conceived the idea of using the dauphin's existence as a means of dominating the [[comte de Provence]] in the event of a restoration. The dauphin was concealed in the fourth storey of the Tower, a wooden figure being substituted for him. Laurent, to protect himself from the consequences of the substitution, replaced the wooden figure with a deaf mute, who was presently exchanged for the scrofulous child of the death certificate. The deaf mute was also concealed in the Temple. It was not the dead child, but the dauphin who left the prison in the coffin, to be retrieved by friends before it reached the cemetery.\n\nNaundorff arrived in Berlin in 1810, with papers giving the name Karl Wilhelm Naundorff. He said he was escaping persecution and settled at [[Spandau]] in 1812 as a clockmaker, marrying Johanna Einert in 1818. In 1822 he removed to [[Brandenburg an der Havel]], and in 1828 to [[Krosno Odrza\u0144skie|Crossen]], near [[Frankfurt (Oder)]]. He was imprisoned from 1825 to 1828 for coining, though apparently on insufficient evidence, and in 1833 came to push his claims in Paris, where he was recognised as the dauphin by many persons formerly connected with the court of [[Louis XVI]]. Expelled from France in 1836, the day after bringing a suit against the [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of France|duchess of Angoul\u00eame]] for the restitution of the dauphin's private property, he lived in exile until his death at [[Delft]] on 10 August 1845, and his tomb was inscribed \"Louis XVII., roi de France et de Navarre (Charles Louis, duc de Normandie)\". The Dutch authorities who had inscribed on his death certificate the name of Charles Louis de Bourbon, duc de Normandie (Louis XVII) permitted his son to bear the name de Bourbon, and when the family appealed in 1850\u201351, and again in 1874, for the restitution of their civil rights as heirs of Louis XVI, no less an advocate than [[Jules Favre]] pled their cause.\n\n===Richemont===\n[[Baron de Richemont]]'s tale that Jeanne Simon, who was genuinely attached to him, smuggled him out in a basket, is simple and more credible, and does not necessarily invalidate the story of the subsequent operations with the deaf mute and the scrofulous patient, Laurent in that case being deceived from the beginning, but it renders them extremely unlikely.\n\nRichemont, alias ''Henri \u00c9thelbert-Louis-Hector H\u00e9bert'', was in prison in [[Milan]] for seven years and began to put forward his claims in Paris in 1828. In 1833, he was again arrested, was brought to trial in the following year and condemned to twelve years' imprisonment. He escaped after a few months and left the country, to return in 1840. He died at [[Gleiz\u00e9]] on 10 August 1853, the name of Louis Charles de France being inscribed on his tomb until the government ordered its removal.\n\n===Williams===\nAnother pretender was Reverend [[Eleazer Williams|Eleazar Williams]], a [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]-born Protestant missionary, and an advocate for land rights of Native Americans. While at the house Francis Vinton, William began shaking and trembling upon seeing a portrait of [[Antoine Simon]], a member of the [[sans-culottes]], claiming the portrait has \"haunted me, day, and night, as long as I can remember.\" Simon was rumored to have physically abused the dauphin while he was imprisoned at the Temple.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e2be8aa0-37bd-46a7-9015-7d525c9588ac@sessionmgr104&vid=1&hid=102|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Francis Vinton was convinced by Eleazar William's reaction, that Williams was Louis-Charles. Williams claims he has no recollection of how he escaped his imprisonment at the Temple, or his early years in France.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nHe was a missionary to Native Americans when the [[prince de Joinville]], son of [[Louis-Philippe]], met him, and after some conversation asked him to sign a document abdicating his rights in favour of Louis-Philippe, in return for which he, the dauphin (alias Eleazar Williams), was to receive the private inheritance which was his. This Eleazar Williams refused. Williams's story is generally regarded as false.\n\n===Burial===\n[[File:LOUIS XVII.jpg|thumb|The grave supposed to be that of Louis XVII; \u00c9glise Sainte-Marguerite, Paris]]\nLouis XVII's remains were not interred with ceremony. \"At seven o'clock the police commissary ordered the body to be taken up, and that they should proceed to the cemetery. It was the season of the longest days, and therefore the interment did not take place in secrecy and at night, as some misinformed narrators have said or written; it took place in broad daylight, and attracted a great concourse of people before the gates of the Temple palace.\" Added, \"The funeral entered the cemetery of Ste. Marguerite, not by the church, as some accounts assert, but by the old gate of the cemetery. The interment was made in the corner, on the left, at a distance of eight or nine feet from the enclosure wall, and at an equal distance from a small house, which subsequently served as a school. The grave was filled up,\u2014no mound marked its place, and not even a trace remained of the interment! Not till then did the commissaries of police and the municipality withdraw, and enter the house opposite the church to draw up the declaration of interment.\"<ref>Memoirs of the Court of Marie Antoinette by Madame Campan, 1900, pg 294</ref>\n\n==Conclusion==\nStrangely, the account of the substitution in the Temple deceived royalists and republicans alike. [[Charlotte Atkyns|Lady Atkyns]] was trying by every possible means to get the dauphin out of his prison when he may already have been in safe hands. A child was in fact delivered to her agents, but he was a deaf mute. That there was a complicated fraud on the guardians of the dauphin was considered by a succession of writers from 1850 onwards, and more recently by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Barbey]], who wisely attempts no ultimate solution. When the partisans of Richemont or Naundorff come to the post-Temple careers of their heroes, they become in most cases so uncritical as to be unconvincing.\n\nBy 1900, there were over 100 pretenders who had presented themselves to be the \"lost-dauphin\". The popularity of the false-dauphins peaked in the wake of the [[July Revolution|1830 Revolution]], and waned over the course of the century. Unlike the deaths of his parents which were a national spectacle, the dauphin's death was a matter of administrative and medical record, consequently easier to repudiate.<ref name=\":5\" /> The myth of the substition before the death of Louis-Charles was popularized and encouraged by [[Jean-Joseph Regnault-Warin|Jean-Joseph Regnault Warin]]'s immense popular novel Le Cimeti\u00e8re de la Madeleine in 1800. Pretenders increased in regularity after the accession of [[Louis XVIII of France|King Louis XVIII]] in the [[Bourbon Restoration]]. Following the Revolution of 1830 pretender claims were treated with heightened seriousness in France because of their ability to serve as critiques of the King Louis-Philippe. The premise of a Bourbon claimant challenging the legitimacy of Louis-Phillppe's legitimacy, certainly served as the reason for the aggression of which the pretenders were pursued in the courts.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nTo his mourners and his impersonators, Louis-Charles offered the opportunity of a transformative and mythical future, beyond the problems of the present. The royalists were able to reverse the child abuse claims with which the revolution charged Marie-Antoinette during her trial, directing them at the revolution itself, for harming Louis-Charles.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 2000, [[Philippe Delorme]] arranged for [[DNA testing]] of the heart as well as bone samples from [[Karl Wilhelm Naundorff]]. Ernst Brinkmann of [[M\u00fcnster University]] and Belgian genetics professor Jean-Jacques Cassiman of [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], conducted [[mitochondrial DNA]] tests in 2000 using samples from Marie-Antoinette, her sisters [[Archduchess Maria Johanna Gabriela of Austria|Maria Johanna Gabriela]] and [[Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria|Maria Josepha]], their mother, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], and two living direct descendants in strict maternal line of Maria Theresa, [[Queen Anne of Romania]] and her brother, Prince Andr\u00e9 de Bourbon Parme. The tests proved that Naundorff was not the dauphin, and the heart was that of Louis-Charles.\n\nIn 2004, the heart of Louis XVII was transferred to the Saint-Denis basilica, the traditional burial place for France's kings and queens. At the Mass, 12-year-old Prince Amaury de Bourbon-Parme carried the heart and placed it in a niche beside the tombs of Louis-Charles' parents, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==In fiction==\n===Novel===\n* 1884 \u2013 [[Mark Twain]], ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', {{ISBN|9780486280615}}\n* 1913 \u2013 [[Baroness Emmuska Orczy]], ''[[Eldorado (novel)|Eldorado]]'', {{ISBN|9780755111121}}\n* 1937 \u2013 [[Rafael Sabatini]], ''[[The Lost King]]'', {{ISBN|9780755115440}}\n* 1951 \u2013 [[Dennis Wheatley]], ''[[The Man Who Killed The King]]'', {{ISBN|0090031903}}\n* 1953 \u2013 [[Willa Gibbs]], ''Seed of Mischief'', {{ISBN|9780110500645}}\n* 1955 \u2013 [[Carley Dawson]], ''Dragon Run''\n* 2000 \u2013 [[Deborah Cadbury]], ''The Lost King of France: A true story of revolution, revenge, and DNA'', {{ISBN|9780312283124}}\n* 2003 \u2013 [[Fran\u00e7oise Chandernagor]], ''La Chambre'', \u00e9ditions Gallimard, {{ISBN|2070314200}}\n* 2003 \u2013 [[Am\u00e9lie de Bourbon Parme]], ''Le Sacre de Louis XVII'', \u00e9ditions Folio, {{ISBN|9782070302284}}\n* 2005 \u2013 [[Ann Dukthas]], ''En M\u00e9moire d'un prince'', \u00e9ditions 10/18, Grands D\u00e9tectives, {{ISBN|2264037903}}\n* 2007 \u2013 [[Christophe Donner]], ''Un roi sans lendemain'', \u00e9ditions Grasset, {{ISBN|2246625815}}\n* 2009 \u2013 [[Dominic Lagan]], ''Live Free or Die'', {{ISBN|0956151809}}\n* 2010 \u2013 [[Jennifer Donnelly]], ''[[Revolution (novel)|Revolution]]'', {{ISBN|9780385737647}}\n* 2011 \u2013 [[Louis Bayard]], ''The Black Tower'', {{ISBN|9782266188906}}\n* 2011 \u2013 [[Jacques Soppelsa]], ''Louis XVII, la piste argentine'', Histoires, A2C M\u00e9dias, {{ISBN|9782916831169}}\n* 2011 \u2013 [[Missouri Dalton]], ''The Grave Watchers'', {{ISBN|9781610402842}}\n\n===Cinema===\n* 1937 \u2013 ''[[Le roi sans couronne]]'' played by [[Scotty Beckett]]\n* 1938 \u2013 ''[[La Marseillaise (film)|La Marseillaise]]'' played by [[Marie-Pierre Sordet-Dant\u00e8s]]\n* 1938 \u2013 ''[[Marie Antoinette (1938 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' played by [[Scotty Beckett]]\n* 1945 \u2013 ''[[Pamela (film)|Pamela]]'' played by [[Serge Emrich]]\n* 1957 \u2013 ''[[Dangerous Exile]]'' played by [[Richard O'Sullivan]]\n* 1982 \u2013 ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel (1982 film)|The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' played by Richard Charles\n* 1989 \u2013 ''[[La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise (film)|La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]]'' played by [[Jane Seymour (actress)#Personal life|Sean Flynn]]\n* 1991 \u2013 ''[[Killer Tomatoes Eat France]]'' played by [[Steve Lundquist]].\n* 1995 \u2013 ''[[Jefferson in Paris]]'' played by [[Damien Groelle]]\n* 2001 \u2013 ''[[The Affair of the Necklace]]'' played by [[Thomas Dodgson-Gates]]\n* 2006 \u2013 ''[[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' played by [[Jago Betts]], [[Axel K\u00fcng]], [[Driss Hugo-Kalff]]\n\n===Music===\n* 2014 \u2013 ''[[Symphony of the Vampire]]'' by [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]]\n* 2018 \u2013 ''[[Sang (Kamijo song)|Sang]]'' by [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]]\n\n==Exhibition==\nFrom 29 June to 1 October 2018 the [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise|Museum of the French Revolution]] showed an exhibition on Louis XVII.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.petit-bulletin.fr/grenoble/expositions-article-61859-Heurs+et+malheurs+de+Louis+XVII++arret+sur+images+++petit+roi++grande+histoire.html|title=Heurs et malheurs de Louis XVII, arr\u00eat sur images : petit roi, grande histoire|last=|first=|date=|website=www.petit-bulletin.fr|language=fr|trans-title=Hours and misfortunes of Louis XVII, freeze frame: little king, big story|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

His older brother, [[Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France|Louis Joseph]], died in June 1789, a little over a month before the start of the [[French Revolution]]. At his brother's death he became the [[heir apparent]] to the throne and the [[Dauphin of France]], a title he held until 1791, when the new constitution accorded the heir apparent the style of Prince Royal of France.\n\nWhen his father was executed on 21 January 1793, during the middle-period of the French Revolution, he became \"[[List of French monarchs|King of France]]\" in the eyes of the royalists. However, since France was by then [[First French Republic|a republic]], and Louis XVII had been imprisoned from August 1792 until his death from illness in 1795 at the age of 10, he  never actually governed. His title stems from monarchist theory, whereby [[The king is dead, long live the king!|there is always a monarch]]; on the death of one monarch, the [[heir apparent]] or failing that the [[heir presumptive]] are immediately monarch. His title was the reason why on his death his uncle took the regnal name of [[Louis XVIII of France]] rather than Louis XVII, retaining it upon the [[Bourbon Restoration]] in 1814.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Acte de bapt\u00eame de Louis Charles.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Baptismal certificate, [[Church of Notre-Dame, Versailles|Parish of Notre-Dame]]]]\nLouis-Charles de France was born at the [[Palace of Versailles]], the second son and third child of his parents, [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie-Antoinette]].<ref name=\":1\">{{EB1911|wstitle=Louis XVII. of France|volume=17|page=45}}</ref> He was named after his father and his mother's favourite sister [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Maria Carolina, Queen of Naples and Sicily]], who was known as Charlotte in the family, Charles being the masculine version of her name. His younger sister, [[Princess Sophie Helene Beatrice of France|Sophie]], was born a little over a year later. He became the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] on the death of his elder brother, Louis-Joseph, on 4 June 1789.\n\nAs customary in royal families, Louis-Charles was cared for by multiple people. Queen Marie Antoinette appointed governesses to look after all three of her children. Louis-Charles' original governess was [[Yolande de Polastron|Yolande de Polastron, ''duchesse de Polignac'']], who left France on the night of 16\u201317 July 1789, at the outbreak of the Revolution, at the urging of Louis XVI.<ref name=\":2\">Lever, Evelyne: ''Marie-Antoinette'', Fayard, Paris, 1991, p. 480</ref> She was replaced by the [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Cro\u00ff|marquise Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Tourzel]]. Additionally, the queen selected [[Agathe de Rambaud]] to be the official nurse of Louis-Charles. [[Alain Decaux]] wrote: <blockquote>\"Madame de Rambaud was officially in charge of the care of the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] from the day of his birth until [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]]; in other words, for seven years. During these seven years, she never left him, she cradled him, took care of him, dressed him, comforted him, and scolded him. Many times, more than Marie Antoinette, she was a true mother for him\".<ref>Alain Decaux, ''[[Louis XVII]] retrouv\u00e9'', 1947, p. 306.{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k73447w/f65.table|title=Gallica|publisher = BNF}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome have suggested that [[Axel von Fersen the Younger|Axel von Fersen]], who was romantically linked with Marie Antoinette, was the father of her son. The fact that Louis Charles was born exactly nine months after he returned to court was noted, but this theory was debunked by most scholars, who reject it, observing that the time of his conception corresponded perfectly in the time that Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had spent a lot of time together. Marie Antoinette, who gained massive weight because of her pregnancies, including this one (she was described as \"very fat\" by the king of Sweden), retained her charisma with an imposing figure in her court, where she had lot of admirers, but she remained a faithful, strong-willed wife and a stern but loving mother.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=180\u2013200, 305\u2013313}}</ref>{{citation needed|date:February 2020|date=February 2020}}\n\nOn 6 October 1789, the royal family was forced by a [[Women's March on Versailles|Parisian mob mostly composed of women]] to move from Versailles to the [[Tuileries Palace]] in [[Paris]], where they spent the next three years as prisoners under the daily surveillance of the national guards who did not spare any humiliation to the royal family; at that time Marie Antoinette was always surrounded by guards, even in her bedroom at night and these guards were present when the Queen was allowed to see her children.\n\nThe family lived a secluded life, and Marie Antoinette dedicated most of her time to her two children under the daily surveillance of the national guards who kept her hands behind her back and searched everybody from the Queen to the children to see if any letters were smuggled to the royal prisoner.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=350\u2013360}}</ref> On 21 June 1791, the family tried to escape in what is known as the [[Flight to Varennes]], but the attempt failed. After the family was recognized, they were brought back to Paris. When the Tuileries Palace was stormed by an armed mob on [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]], the royal family sought refuge at the Legislative Assembly.\n\nOn 13 August, the royal family was imprisoned in the tower of the [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]]. At first, their conditions were not extremely harsh, but they were prisoners and were re-styled as \"Capets\" by the newborn Republic. On 11 December, at the beginning of his trial, Louis XVI was separated from his family.\n\n===Naming===\nAt his birth, Louis-Charles, a ''[[Fils de France]]'' (\"Son of France\"), was given the title of [[Duke of Normandy]], and, on 4 June 1789, when [[Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France]], his elder brother, died, the four-year-old became [[Dauphin of France]], title he held until [[French Constitution of 1791|September 1791]], when France became a constitutional monarchy. Under the new constitution, the heir-apparent to the throne of France, formerly \"Dauphin\", was restyled ''Prince Royal''. Louis-Charles held that title until the [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|fall of the monarchy]] on 21 September 1792. At the death of his father on 21 January 1793, royalists and foreign powers intent on restoring the monarchy held him to be the new king of France, with the title of Louis XVII. From his exile in [[Hamm]], in today's [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], his uncle, the Count of Provence and future [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], who had emigrated on 21 June 1791, appointed himself [[Regent]] for the young imprisoned king.\n\n===Prison and rumours of escape===\n\n====1793: In care of Antoine Simon====\n[[File:Louis XVI au Temple, Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise - Vizille.jpg|thumb|''Louis XVI taking care of the education of his son in the [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]]'', ([[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]]).]]\nImmediately following Louis XVI's execution, plots were hatched for the escape of the prisoners from the Temple, the chief of which were engineered by the {{ill|Fran\u00e7ois Augustin Regnier de Jarjayes|lt=Chevalier de Jarjayes|fr}}, the [[Jean, Baron de Batz|Baron de Batz]], and [[Charlotte Atkyns|Lady Atkyns]]. All came to nothing.\n\nOn 3 July, Louis-Charles was separated from his mother and put in the care of [[Antoine Simon]], a [[Shoemaking|cobbler]] who had been named his guardian by the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and tasked to transform the former young prince into a staunch republican citizen.\n\nThe tales told by royalist writers of the cruelty inflicted by Simon and his wife on the child are not proven. Louis Charles' sister, Marie Therese, wrote in her memoires about the \"monster Simon\", as did Alcide Beauchesne. Antoine Simon's wife Marie-Jeanne, in fact, took great care of the child's person. Stories survive narrating how he was encouraged to eat and drink to excess and learned the language of the gutter. The foreign secretaries of Britain and Spain also heard accounts from their spies that the boy was raped by prostitutes in order to infect him with venereal diseases to supply the Commune with manufactured \"evidence\" against the Queen.<ref name=nagel /> However, the scenes related by {{ill|Alcide de Beauchesne|fr}} of the physical martyrdom of the child are not supported by any testimony, though he was at this time seen by a great number of people.\n\nOn 6 October, [[Jean-Nicolas Pache|Pache]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette|Chaumette]], [[Jacques H\u00e9bert]] and others visited him and secured his signature to charges of sexual molestation against his mother and his aunt.<ref name=nagel>{{cite book|last=Nagel|first=Susan|title=Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se: the fate of Marie Antoinette's daughter|year=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0-7475-9666-0|pages=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ydFDp1ZasMC }}</ref> The next day he met  with his elder sister [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-Charlotte]] for the last time.\n\n====1794: Illness====\nOn 19 January 1794, the Simons left the Temple, after securing a receipt for the safe transfer of their ward, who was declared to be in good health. A large part of the Temple records from that time onward disappeared under the [[Bourbon Restoration]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} making knowledge of the facts impossible. Two days after the departure of the Simons, Louis-Charles is said by the Restoration historians to have been put in a dark room which was barricaded like the cage of a wild animal. The story runs that food was passed through the bars to the boy, who survived despite the accumulated filth of his surroundings.\n\n[[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] visited Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se on 11 May, but no one, according to the legend, entered the dauphin's room for six months until [[Paul Fran\u00e7ois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]] visited the prison after the 9th Thermidor (27 July 1794). Barras's account of the visit describes the child as suffering from extreme neglect, but conveys no idea of the alleged walling in. It is nevertheless certain that during the first half of 1794 Louis-Charles was very strictly secluded; he had no special guardian, but was under the charge of guards who changed from day to day.\n\nThe boy made no complaint to Barras of any ill treatment. He was then cleaned and re-clothed. His room was cleaned, and during the day he was visited by his new attendant, [[Jean Jacques Christophe Laurent]] (1770\u20131807), a creole from [[Martinique]]. From 8 November onward, Laurent had assistance from a man named Gomin.\n\n[[File:Louis Charles of France2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Louis Charles by \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun]]\nLouis-Charles was then taken out for fresh air and walks on the roof of the Tower. From about the time of Gomin's arrival, he was inspected, not by delegates of the Commune, but by representatives of the civil committee of the 48 sections of Paris. The rare recurrence of the same inspectors would obviously facilitate fraud, if any such was intended. From the end of October onward, the child maintained an obstinate silence, explained by Laurent as a determination taken on the day he made his deposition against his mother. On 19 December 1794 he was visited by three commissioners from the Committee of Public Safety&nbsp;\u2014 [[Jean-Baptiste Harmand|J. B. Harmand de la Meuse]], [[Jean-Baptiste Charles Matthieu|J. B. C. Mathieu]] and [[Jacques Reverchon|J. Reverchon]]&nbsp;\u2014 who extracted no word from him.\n\n====1795: Death====\n[[File:Jeton sur la mort de louis XVII.jpg|thumb|Louis XVII]]\nOn 31 March 1795, [[\u00c9tienne Lasne]] was appointed to be the child's guardian in replacement of Laurent. In May 1795, the boy was seriously ill, and a doctor, [[P. J. Desault]], who had visited him seven months earlier, was summoned. However, on 1 June, Desault died suddenly, not without suspicion of poison, and it was some days before doctors [[Philippe-Jean Pelletan]] and [[Dumangin]] were called.\n\nLouis-Charles died on 8 June 1795. The next day an autopsy was conducted by Pelletan, at which it was stated that a child apparently about ten years of age, \"which the commissioners told us was the late Louis Capet's son\", had died of a [[scrofulous]] infection of long standing. \"Scrofula\" as it was previously known, is nowadays called ''[[Tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis]]'' referring to a [[lymphadenitis]] (chronic lymph node swelling or infection) of the neck ([[cervical lymph nodes]]) [[lymph node]]s associated with [[tuberculosis]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/100011836|tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nDuring the autopsy, the physician Dr. Pelletan was shocked to see the countless scars which covered the body of Louis-Charles.

A skull was found there in 1846 and identified as his, though later re-examination in 1893 showed it to be from a teenager and therefore unlikely to be his.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Xavier de Roche, ''Louis XVII.

Thus, the heart of Louis-Charles was not interred with the rest of the body. Dr. Pelletan stored the smuggled heart in distilled wine in order to preserve it. However, after 8 to 10 years the distilled wine had evaporated, and the heart was further kept dry.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the Restoration in 1815, Dr. Pelletan attempted to give the heart to Louis-Charles's uncle, [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]; the latter refused because he could not bring himself to believe that was the heart of his nephew. Dr. Pelletan then donated the heart to the [[Archbishop of Paris]], [[Hyacinthe-Louis de Qu\u00e9len]].\n\nFollowing the [[July Revolution|Revolution of 1830]], and the plundering of the palace, the son of Pelletan found the relic in the remnants of the palace and placed it in the crystal urn, in which it still resides today. After his death in 1879, Eduard Dumont received the heart.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1895, the nephew of the [[Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este (1817\u20131886)|Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este]], [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Don Carlos de Bourbon]], a pretender to the throne of Spain accepted the relic from a friend of Eduart Dumont, Paul Cottin. The relic was held near [[Vienna|Vienna, Austria]] at the castle of [[Frohsdorf]]. The son of Carlos, [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid]], in 1909 inherited the heart, and gave it to his sister, [[Infanta Beatriz of Spain|Beatriz]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFinally two granddaughters of Don Carlos offered the heart to the president of the Memorial of [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint-Denis]] in Paris, Duc de Bauffremont, where he put the heart and its crystal urn in the necropolis of the Kings of France, the burial place of Louis-Charles's parents and other members of the [[Capetian dynasty|French royal family]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn December 1999, public notaries witnessed a section of the heart muscle of the aorta removed from the rest of the heart, and the transfer of the samples into a sealed envelope, and then the opening of the sealed envelope in the laboratory to be tested. Scientists using DNA samples from [[Queen Anne of Romania]], and her brother Andre de Bourbon-Parme, maternal relatives of Louis XVII, and from a strand of Marie-Antoinette's hair, thus proved the young royal's identity. Historian [[Jean Tulard]] wrote: \"This [mummified] heart is ... almost certainly that of Louis XVII.

When the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Bourbon monarchy was restored]] in 1814, some one hundred claimants came forward. Would-be royal heirs continued to appear across Europe for decades afterward and some of their descendants still have small but loyal retinues of followers today. Popular candidates for the Lost Dauphin included [[John James Audubon]], the naturalist; [[Eleazer Williams]], a missionary from [[Wisconsin]] of [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] descent; and [[Karl Wilhelm Naundorff]], a German clockmaker. However, DNA testing conducted in 1993 proved that Naundorff was not the Dauphin.<ref>Frasier, Antonia (2001), ''Marie Antoinette: The Journey''</ref>\n\n===Naundorff===\nKarl Wilhelm Naundorff's story rested on a series of complicated intrigues.

The dauphin was concealed in the fourth storey of the Tower, a wooden figure being substituted for him. Laurent, to protect himself from the consequences of the substitution, replaced the wooden figure with a deaf mute, who was presently exchanged for the scrofulous child of the death certificate. The deaf mute was also concealed in the Temple. It was not the dead child, but the dauphin who left the prison in the coffin, to be retrieved by friends before it reached the cemetery.\n\nNaundorff arrived in Berlin in 1810, with papers giving the name Karl Wilhelm Naundorff. He said he was escaping persecution and settled at [[Spandau]] in 1812 as a clockmaker, marrying Johanna Einert in 1818. In 1822 he removed to [[Brandenburg an der Havel]], and in 1828 to [[Krosno Odrza\u0144skie|Crossen]], near [[Frankfurt (Oder)]]. He was imprisoned from 1825 to 1828 for coining, though apparently on insufficient evidence, and in 1833 came to push his claims in Paris, where he was recognised as the dauphin by many persons formerly connected with the court of [[Louis XVI]]. Expelled from France in 1836, the day after bringing a suit against the [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of France|duchess of Angoul\u00eame]] for the restitution of the dauphin's private property, he lived in exile until his death at [[Delft]] on 10 August 1845, and his tomb was inscribed \"Louis XVII., roi de France et de Navarre (Charles Louis, duc de Normandie)\". The Dutch authorities who had inscribed on his death certificate the name of Charles Louis de Bourbon, duc de Normandie (Louis XVII) permitted his son to bear the name de Bourbon, and when the family appealed in 1850\u201351, and again in 1874, for the restitution of their civil rights as heirs of Louis XVI, no less an advocate than [[Jules Favre]] pled their cause.\n\n===Richemont===\n[[Baron de Richemont]]'s tale that Jeanne Simon, who was genuinely attached to him, smuggled him out in a basket, is simple and more credible, and does not necessarily invalidate the story of the subsequent operations with the deaf mute and the scrofulous patient, Laurent in that case being deceived from the beginning, but it renders them extremely unlikely.\n\nRichemont, alias ''Henri \u00c9thelbert-Louis-Hector H\u00e9bert'', was in prison in [[Milan]] for seven years and began to put forward his claims in Paris in 1828. In 1833, he was again arrested, was brought to trial in the following year and condemned to twelve years' imprisonment. He escaped after a few months and left the country, to return in 1840. He died at [[Gleiz\u00e9]] on 10 August 1853, the name of Louis Charles de France being inscribed on his tomb until the government ordered its removal.\n\n===Williams===\nAnother pretender was Reverend [[Eleazer Williams|Eleazar Williams]], a [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]-born Protestant missionary, and an advocate for land rights of Native Americans. While at the house Francis Vinton, William began shaking and trembling upon seeing a portrait of [[Antoine Simon]], a member of the [[sans-culottes]], claiming the portrait has \"haunted me, day, and night, as long as I can remember.\" Simon was rumored to have physically abused the dauphin while he was imprisoned at the Temple.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e2be8aa0-37bd-46a7-9015-7d525c9588ac@sessionmgr104&vid=1&hid=102|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Francis Vinton was convinced by Eleazar William's reaction, that Williams was Louis-Charles. Williams claims he has no recollection of how he escaped his imprisonment at the Temple, or his early years in France.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nHe was a missionary to Native Americans when the [[prince de Joinville]], son of [[Louis-Philippe]], met him, and after some conversation asked him to sign a document abdicating his rights in favour of Louis-Philippe, in return for which he, the dauphin (alias Eleazar Williams), was to receive the private inheritance which was his. This Eleazar Williams refused. Williams's story is generally regarded as false.\n\n===Burial===\n[[File:LOUIS XVII.jpg|thumb|The grave supposed to be that of Louis XVII; \u00c9glise Sainte-Marguerite, Paris]]\nLouis XVII's remains were not interred with ceremony. \"At seven o'clock the police commissary ordered the body to be taken up, and that they should proceed to the cemetery. It was the season of the longest days, and therefore the interment did not take place in secrecy and at night, as some misinformed narrators have said or written; it took place in broad daylight, and attracted a great concourse of people before the gates of the Temple palace.\" Added, \"The funeral entered the cemetery of Ste. Marguerite, not by the church, as some accounts assert, but by the old gate of the cemetery. The interment was made in the corner, on the left, at a distance of eight or nine feet from the enclosure wall, and at an equal distance from a small house, which subsequently served as a school. The grave was filled up,\u2014no mound marked its place, and not even a trace remained of the interment! Not till then did the commissaries of police and the municipality withdraw, and enter the house opposite the church to draw up the declaration of interment.\"<ref>Memoirs of the Court of Marie Antoinette by Madame Campan, 1900, pg 294</ref>\n\n==Conclusion==\nStrangely, the account of the substitution in the Temple deceived royalists and republicans alike. [[Charlotte Atkyns|Lady Atkyns]] was trying by every possible means to get the dauphin out of his prison when he may already have been in safe hands. A child was in fact delivered to her agents, but he was a deaf mute. That there was a complicated fraud on the guardians of the dauphin was considered by a succession of writers from 1850 onwards, and more recently by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Barbey]], who wisely attempts no ultimate solution. When the partisans of Richemont or Naundorff come to the post-Temple careers of their heroes, they become in most cases so uncritical as to be unconvincing.\n\nBy 1900, there were over 100 pretenders who had presented themselves to be the \"lost-dauphin\". The popularity of the false-dauphins peaked in the wake of the [[July Revolution|1830 Revolution]], and waned over the course of the century. Unlike the deaths of his parents which were a national spectacle, the dauphin's death was a matter of administrative and medical record, consequently easier to repudiate.<ref name=\":5\" /> The myth of the substition before the death of Louis-Charles was popularized and encouraged by [[Jean-Joseph Regnault-Warin|Jean-Joseph Regnault Warin]]'s immense popular novel Le Cimeti\u00e8re de la Madeleine in 1800. Pretenders increased in regularity after the accession of [[Louis XVIII of France|King Louis XVIII]] in the [[Bourbon Restoration]]. Following the Revolution of 1830 pretender claims were treated with heightened seriousness in France because of their ability to serve as critiques of the King Louis-Philippe. The premise of a Bourbon claimant challenging the legitimacy of Louis-Phillppe's legitimacy, certainly served as the reason for the aggression of which the pretenders were pursued in the courts.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nTo his mourners and his impersonators, Louis-Charles offered the opportunity of a transformative and mythical future, beyond the problems of the present. The royalists were able to reverse the child abuse claims with which the revolution charged Marie-Antoinette during her trial, directing them at the revolution itself, for harming Louis-Charles.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 2000, [[Philippe Delorme]] arranged for [[DNA testing]] of the heart as well as bone samples from [[Karl Wilhelm Naundorff]]. Ernst Brinkmann of [[M\u00fcnster University]] and Belgian genetics professor Jean-Jacques Cassiman of [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], conducted [[mitochondrial DNA]] tests in 2000 using samples from Marie-Antoinette, her sisters [[Archduchess Maria Johanna Gabriela of Austria|Maria Johanna Gabriela]] and [[Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria|Maria Josepha]], their mother, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], and two living direct descendants in strict maternal line of Maria Theresa, [[Queen Anne of Romania]] and her brother, Prince Andr\u00e9 de Bourbon Parme. The tests proved that Naundorff was not the dauphin, and the heart was that of Louis-Charles.\n\nIn 2004, the heart of Louis XVII was transferred to the Saint-Denis basilica, the traditional burial place for France's kings and queens. At the Mass, 12-year-old Prince Amaury de Bourbon-Parme carried the heart and placed it in a niche beside the tombs of Louis-Charles' parents, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==In fiction==\n===Novel===\n* 1884 \u2013 [[Mark Twain]], ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', {{ISBN|9780486280615}}\n* 1913 \u2013 [[Baroness Emmuska Orczy]], ''[[Eldorado (novel)|Eldorado]]'', {{ISBN|9780755111121}}\n* 1937 \u2013 [[Rafael Sabatini]], ''[[The Lost King]]'', {{ISBN|9780755115440}}\n* 1951 \u2013 [[Dennis Wheatley]], ''[[The Man Who Killed The King]]'', {{ISBN|0090031903}}\n* 1953 \u2013 [[Willa Gibbs]], ''Seed of Mischief'', {{ISBN|9780110500645}}\n* 1955 \u2013 [[Carley Dawson]], ''Dragon Run''\n* 2000 \u2013 [[Deborah Cadbury]], ''The Lost King of France: A true story of revolution, revenge, and DNA'', {{ISBN|9780312283124}}\n* 2003 \u2013 [[Fran\u00e7oise Chandernagor]], ''La Chambre'', \u00e9ditions Gallimard, {{ISBN|2070314200}}\n* 2003 \u2013 [[Am\u00e9lie de Bourbon Parme]], ''Le Sacre de Louis XVII'', \u00e9ditions Folio, {{ISBN|9782070302284}}\n* 2005 \u2013 [[Ann Dukthas]], ''En M\u00e9moire d'un prince'', \u00e9ditions 10/18, Grands D\u00e9tectives, {{ISBN|2264037903}}\n* 2007 \u2013 [[Christophe Donner]], ''Un roi sans lendemain'', \u00e9ditions Grasset, {{ISBN|2246625815}}\n* 2009 \u2013 [[Dominic Lagan]], ''Live Free or Die'', {{ISBN|0956151809}}\n* 2010 \u2013 [[Jennifer Donnelly]], ''[[Revolution (novel)|Revolution]]'', {{ISBN|9780385737647}}\n* 2011 \u2013 [[Louis Bayard]], ''The Black Tower'', {{ISBN|9782266188906}}\n* 2011 \u2013 [[Jacques Soppelsa]], ''Louis XVII, la piste argentine'', Histoires, A2C M\u00e9dias, {{ISBN|9782916831169}}\n* 2011 \u2013 [[Missouri Dalton]], ''The Grave Watchers'', {{ISBN|9781610402842}}\n\n===Cinema===\n* 1937 \u2013 ''[[Le roi sans couronne]]'' played by [[Scotty Beckett]]\n* 1938 \u2013 ''[[La Marseillaise (film)|La Marseillaise]]'' played by [[Marie-Pierre Sordet-Dant\u00e8s]]\n* 1938 \u2013 ''[[Marie Antoinette (1938 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' played by [[Scotty Beckett]]\n* 1945 \u2013 ''[[Pamela (film)|Pamela]]'' played by [[Serge Emrich]]\n* 1957 \u2013 ''[[Dangerous Exile]]'' played by [[Richard O'Sullivan]]\n* 1982 \u2013 ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel (1982 film)|The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' played by Richard Charles\n* 1989 \u2013 ''[[La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise (film)|La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]]'' played by [[Jane Seymour (actress)#Personal life|Sean Flynn]]\n* 1991 \u2013 ''[[Killer Tomatoes Eat France]]'' played by [[Steve Lundquist]].\n* 1995 \u2013 ''[[Jefferson in Paris]]'' played by [[Damien Groelle]]\n* 2001 \u2013 ''[[The Affair of the Necklace]]'' played by [[Thomas Dodgson-Gates]]\n* 2006 \u2013 ''[[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' played by [[Jago Betts]], [[Axel K\u00fcng]], [[Driss Hugo-Kalff]]\n\n===Music===\n* 2014 \u2013 ''[[Symphony of the Vampire]]'' by [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]]\n* 2018 \u2013 ''[[Sang (Kamijo song)|Sang]]'' by [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]]\n\n==Exhibition==\nFrom June 29 to October 1, 2018 the [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise|Museum of the French Revolution]] showed an exhibition on Louis XVII.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.petit-bulletin.fr/grenoble/expositions-article-61859-Heurs+et+malheurs+de+Louis+XVII++arret+sur+images+++petit+roi++grande+histoire.html|title=Heurs et malheurs de Louis XVII, arr\u00eat sur images : petit roi, grande histoire|last=|first=|date=|website=www.petit-bulletin.fr|language=fr|trans-title=Hours and misfortunes of Louis XVII, freeze frame: little king, big story|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

The umbels are some {{convert|8-12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, relatively small compared to the tall stems, hence the description 'drumstick allium'. Individual flowers, of which there are many, are a typical allium shape, with a superior ovary and six [[tepal]]s of a lilac to purple colour, around 2.5 to 5&nbsp;cm long; white forms are known.\n\nPlants grow on rocky slopes and in fields at elevations of {{convert|1500-2500|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Davies1992/><ref name=Mathew1978>{{Citation |last=Mathew |first=Brian |year=1978 |title=The Larger Bulbs |publication-place=London |publisher=B.T.

The umbels are some {{convert|8-12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, relatively small compared to the tall stems, hence the description 'drumstick allium'. Individual flowers, of which there are many, are a typical allium shape, with a superior ovary and six [[tepal]]s of a lilac to purple colour, around 2.5 to 5&nbsp;cm long; white forms are known.\n\nPlants grow on rocky slopes and in fields at elevations of {{convert|1500-2500|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Davies1992/><ref name=Mathew1978>{{Citation |last=Mathew |first=Brian |year=1978 |title=The Larger Bulbs |publication-place=London |publisher=B.T.
