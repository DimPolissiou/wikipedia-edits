The series features new production designs and the characters (aside from the host) are animated digitally, though the visual style remains similar to the style used in the original series.\n\nLike the original show, ''Blue's Clues & You!'' depended upon built-in silences designed to encourage audience participation and what ''The New York Times'' called \"direct address inviting preschoolers to play along with games and solve mini-mysteries\".<ref name=\"onstad\"/> The show's producers recognized that its return was due to 1990s nostalgia, and that although young children had more access to technology and were more visual than preschoolers in the 1990s, they still had the same developmental and emotional needs to \"slow down\".<ref name=\"onstad\"/>\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{{See also|List of Blue's Clues characters}}\n=== Main ===\n* Blue (voiced by [[Traci Paige Johnson]]) \u2013 A blue puppy who leaves pawprints on objects as clues to what she wants to say.\n* Josh (played by Joshua Dela Cruz) \u2013 The host of the new series.

The series features new production designs and the characters (aside from the host) are animated digitally, though the visual style remains similar to the style used in the original series.\n\nLike the original show, ''Blue's Clues & You!'' depended upon built-in silences designed to encourage audience participation and what ''The New York Times'' called \"direct address inviting preschoolers to play along with games and solve mini-mysteries\".<ref name=\"onstad\"/> The show's producers recognized that its return was due to 1990s nostalgia, and that although young children had more access to technology and were more visual than preschoolers in the 1990s, they still had the same developmental and emotional needs to \"slow down\".<ref name=\"onstad\"/>\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{{See also|List of Blue's Clues characters}}\n=== Main ===\n* Blue (voiced by [[Traci Paige Johnson]]) \u2013 A blue puppy who leaves pawprints on objects as clues to what she wants to say.\n* Josh (played by Joshua Dela Cruz) \u2013 The host of the new series.

{"title_page": "Adverb", "text_new": "{{English grammar}}\n\nAn '''adverb''' is a word or an expression that [[modifier (grammar)|modifies]] a [[verb]], [[adjective]], [[determiner]], [[clause]], [[preposition]], or [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]].ty, etc., answering questions such as ''how?'', ''in what way?'', ''when?'', ''where?'', and ''to what extent?''. This is called the [[adverbial]] function, and may be realized by single words (adverbs) or by multi-word expressions ([[adverbial phrase]]s and [[adverbial clause]]s).\n\nAdverbs are traditionally regarded as one of the [[parts of speech]].

Some examples:\n*She sang '''loudly''' (''loudly'' modifies the verb ''sang'', indicating the manner of singing)\n*We left it '''here''' (''here'' modifies the verb phrase ''left it'', indicating place)\n*I worked '''yesterday''' (''yesterday'' modifies the verb ''worked'', indicating time)\n*You '''often''' make mistakes (''often'' modifies the verb phrase ''make mistakes'', indicating frequency)\n*He '''undoubtedly''' did it (''undoubtedly'' modifies the verb phrase ''did it'', indicating certainty)\n\nAdverbs can also be used as modifiers of [[adjective]]s, and of other adverbs, often to indicate degree. Examples:\n* You are '''quite''' right (the adverb ''quite'' modifies the adjective ''right'')\n* She sang '''very''' loudly (the adverb ''very'' modifies another adverb \u2013 ''loudly'')\n\nThey can also modify [[determiner]]s, [[prepositional phrase]]s,<ref name=\"stud\"/> or whole [[clause]]s or [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, as in the following examples:\n* I bought '''practically''' the only fruit (''practically'' modifies the determiner ''the '' in the [[noun phrase]], \"the only fruit\" wherein \"only\" is an [[adjective]])\n* She drove us '''almost''' to the station (''almost'' modifies the prepositional phrase ''to the station'')\n* '''Certainly''' we need to act (''certainly'' modifies the sentence as a whole)\nAdverbs thus perform a wide range of modifying functions. The major exception is the function of modifier of [[noun]]s, which is performed instead by adjectives (compare ''she sang loudly'' with ''her loud singing disturbed me''; here the verb ''sang'' is modified by the adverb ''loudly'', whereas the noun ''singing'' is modified by the adjective ''loud'').

Other languages often have similar methods for deriving adverbs from adjectives ([[French language|French]], for example, uses the suffix ''-ment''), or else use the same form for both adjectives and adverbs, as in German and Dutch where for example ''schnell'' or ''snel'', respectively, can mean either \"quick\" or \"quickly\", depending on the context. Many other adverbs, however, are not related to adjectives in this way; they may be derived from other words or phrases, or may be single [[morpheme]]s. Examples of such adverbs in English include ''here, there, together, yesterday, aboard, very, almost'', etc.\n\nWhere the meaning permits, adverbs may undergo [[comparison (grammar)|comparison]], taking [[comparative]] and [[superlative]] forms. In English this is usually done by adding ''more'' and ''most'' before the adverb (''more slowly, most slowly''), although there are a few adverbs that take [[inflection|inflected]] forms, such as ''well'', for which ''better'' and ''best'' are used.\n\nFor more information about the formation and use of adverbs in English, see {{slink|English grammar|Adverbs}}. For other languages, see {{slink||In specific languages}} below, and the articles on individual languages and their grammars.\n\n== Adverbs as a \"catch-all\" category ==\nAdverbs are considered a [[part of speech]] in traditional English grammar, and are still included as a part of speech in grammar taught in schools and used in dictionaries. However, modern grammarians recognize that words traditionally grouped together as adverbs serve a number of different functions. Some describe adverbs a \"catch-all\" category that includes all words that do not belong to one of the other parts of speech.<ref>For example: Thomas Edward Payne, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LC3DfjWfCiwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Describing Morphosyntax: A Guide for Field Linguists]'', CUP 1997, p. 69.</ref>\n\nA logical approach to dividing words into classes relies on recognizing which words can be used in a certain context.  For example, the only type of word that can be inserted in the following template to form a grammatical sentence is a [[noun]]:\n:The _____ is red. (For example, \"The hat is red\".)\nWhen this approach is taken, it is seen that adverbs fall into a number of different categories. For example, some adverbs can be used to modify an entire sentence, whereas others cannot. Even when a sentential adverb has other functions, the meaning is often not the same. For example, in the sentences ''She gave birth naturally'' and ''Naturally, she gave birth'', the word ''naturally'' has different meanings: in the first sentence, as a verb-modifying adverb, it means \"in a natural manner\", while in the second sentence, as a sentential adverb, it means something like \"of course\".\n\nWords like ''very'' afford another example. We can say ''Perry is very fast'', but not ''Perry very won the race''. These words can modify adjectives but not verbs. On the other hand, there are words like ''here'' and ''there'' that cannot modify adjectives. We can say ''The sock looks good there'' but not ''It is a there beautiful sock''. The fact that many adverbs can be used in more than one of these functions can confuse the issue, and it may seem like splitting hairs to say that a single adverb is really two or more words that serve different functions. However, this distinction can be useful, especially when considering adverbs like ''naturally'' that have different meanings in their different functions. [[Rodney Huddleston]] distinguishes between a ''word'' and a ''lexicogrammatical-word''.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Huddleston\n  | first = Rodney\n  | authorlink = Rodney Huddleston\n  | title = English Grammar: An Outline\n  | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n  | location = Cambridge\n  | year = 1988\n  | page = 7\n  | doi = 10.2277/0521311527\n  | isbn = 0-521-32311-8 }}</ref>\n\nGrammarians find difficulty categorizing [[Affirmative and negative|negating words]], such as the English ''not''. Although traditionally listed as an adverb, this word does not behave grammatically like any other, and it probably should be placed in a class of its own.<ref>[[Guglielmo Cinque|Cinque, Guglielmo]].  1999.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\n==In specific languages==\n* In [[Dutch language|Dutch]] adverbs have the basic form of their corresponding [[adjective]]s and are not inflected (though they sometimes can be [[Comparison (grammar)|compared]]).\n* In [[German language|German]] the term ''Adverb'' is differently defined than in the English language. German adverbs form a group of noninflectable words (though a few can be [[Comparison (grammar)|compared]]). An English ''adverb'' which is derived from an adjective is arranged in German under the adjectives with ''adverbial use'' in the sentence. The others are also called adverbs in the German language.\n* In [[Scandinavian languages]], adverbs are typically derived from adjectives by adding the suffix '-t', which makes it identical to the adjective's neuter form. Scandinavian adjectives, like English ones, are inflected in terms of comparison by adding '-ere'/'-are' (comparative) or '-est'/'-ast' (superlative). In inflected forms of adjectives, the '-t' is absent. [[Periphrastic]] comparison is also possible.\n* In [[Romance languages]], many adverbs are formed from adjectives (often the feminine form) by adding '-mente' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Italian language|Italian]]) or '-ment' ([[French language|French]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) (from [[Latin]] ''mens, mentis'': mind, intelligence, or [[suffix]] ''-mentum'', result or way of action). Other adverbs are single forms which are invariable.\n* In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], almost all adverbs are simply the masculine singular form of the corresponding adjective, one notable exception being ''bine'' (\"well\") / ''bun'' (\"good\"). However, there are some Romanian adverbs built from certain masculine singular nouns using the suffix ''\"-e\u0219te\"'', such as the following ones: ''b\u0103ie\u021b-e\u0219te'' (boyishly), ''tiner-e\u0219te'' (youthfully), ''b\u0103rb\u0103t-e\u0219te'' (manly), ''fr\u0103\u021b-e\u0219te'' (brotherly), etc.\n* [[Interlingua]] also forms adverbs by adding '-mente' to the adjective. If an adjective ends in ''c'', the adverbial ending is '-amente'. A few short, invariable adverbs, such as ''ben'', \"well\", and ''mal'', \"badly\", are available and widely used.\n* In [[Esperanto]], adverbs are not formed from adjectives but are made by adding '-e' directly to the word root. Thus, from ''bon'' are derived ''bone'', \"well\", and ''bona'', \"good\". See also: [[special Esperanto adverbs]].\n* In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] adverbs are formed from adjectives of any degree through the suffixes ''-ul/\u00fcl'' and ''-an/en'' depending on the adjective: ''sz\u00e9p'' (beautiful) \u2192 ''sz\u00e9pen'' (beautifully) or the comparative ''szebb'' (more beautiful) \u2192 ''szebben'' (more beautifully)\n* [[Modern Standard Arabic]] forms adverbs by adding the indefinite accusative ending '-an' to the root: ''kathiir-'', \"many\", becomes ''kathiiran'' \"much\".  However, Arabic often avoids adverbs by using a [[cognate accusative]] followed by an adjective.\n* [[Austronesian languages]] generally form [[comparative]] adverbs by repeating the root (as in [[Wiki|WikiWiki]]) like the plural noun.\n* [[Japanese language|Japanese]] forms adverbs from verbal adjectives by adding  /ku/ (\u304f) to the stem (haya- \"rapid\" hayai \"quick/early\", hayakatta \"was quick\", hayaku \"quickly\") and from [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] adjectives by placing /ni/ (\u306b) after the adjective instead of the copula /na/ (\u306a) or /no/ (\u306e) (rippa \"splendid\", rippa ni \"splendidly\"). The derivations are quite productive, but from a few adjectives, adverbs may not be derived.\n* In the [[Celtic languages]], an adverbial form is often made by preceding the adjective with a preposition: ''go'' in [[Irish language|Irish]] or ''gu'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]], meaning 'until'. In [[Cornish language|Cornish]], ''yn'' is used, meaning 'in'.\n* In [[Modern Greek]], an adverb is most commonly made by adding the endings <-\u03b1> or <-\u03c9\u03c2> to the root of an adjective. Often, the adverbs formed from a common root using each of these endings have slightly different meanings. So, <\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2> (<t\u00e9leios>, meaning \"perfect\" and \"complete\") yields <\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1> (<t\u00e9leia>, \"perfectly\") and <\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03c2> (<tele\u00edos>, \"completely\"). Not all adjectives can be transformed into adverbs by using both endings. <\u0393\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2> (<gr\u00edgoros>, \"rapid\") becomes <\u03b3\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1> (<gr\u00edgora>, \"rapidly\"), but not normally *<\u03b3\u03c1\u03b7\u03b3\u03cc\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2> (*<grig\u00f3ros>). When the <-\u03c9\u03c2> ending is used to transform an adjective whose tonal accent is on the third syllable from the end, such as <\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2> (<ep\u00edsimos>, \"official\"), the corresponding adjective is accented on the second syllable from the end; compare <\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1> (<ep\u00edsima>) and <\u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03ae\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2> (<epis\u00edmos>), which both mean \"officially\". There are also other endings with particular and restricted use as <-\u03af>, <-\u03b5\u03af>, <-\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af>, etc. For example, <\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03af> (<atimorit\u00ed>, \"with impunity\") and <\u03b1\u03c3\u03c5\u03b6\u03b7\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03af> (<asyzitit\u00ed>, \"indisputably\"); <\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b5\u03af> (<autolexe\u00ed> \"word for word\") and <\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b5\u03af> (<autostigme\u00ed>, \"in no time\"); <\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af> [<anglist\u00ed> \"in English (language)\"] and <\u03c0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af> (<papagalist\u00ed>, \"by rote\"); etc.\n* In [[Latvian language|Latvian]], an adverb is formed from an adjective by changing the masculine or feminine adjective endings -s and -a to -i. \"Labs\", meaning \"good\", becomes \"labi\" for \"well\". Latvian adverbs have a particular use in expressions meaning \"to speak\" or \"to understand\" a language. Rather than use the noun meaning \"Latvian/English/Russian\", the adverb formed form these words is used. \"Es run\u0101ju latviski/angliski/krieviski\" means \"I speak Latvian/English/Russian\" or, literally, \"I speak Latvianly/Englishly/Russianly\". If a noun is required, the expression used means literally \"language of the Latvians/English/Russians\", \"latvie\u0161u/ang\u013cu/krievu valoda\".\n*In [[Russian language|Russian]], and analogously in [[Ukrainian Language|Ukrainian]]  and some other [[Slavic languages]], most adverbs are formed by removing the adjectival suffices \"-\u0438\u0439\" \"-\u0430\" or \"-\u0435\" from an adjective, and replacing them with the adverbial \"-\u043e\". For example, in Ukrainian, \"\u0448\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0438\u0439\", \"\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430\", and \"\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0435\" (fast, nice, tasty) become \"\u0448\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043a\u043e\", \"\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e\", and \"\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e\" (quickly, nicely, tastefully), while in Russian, \"\u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044b\u0439\", \"\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439\" and \"\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439\" (quick, good, wonderful) become \"\u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\", \"\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\", \"\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\" (quickly, well, wonderfully). Another wide group of adverbs are formed by gluing a [[preposition]] to an oblique case form. In Ukrainian, for example, ('''\u0434\u043e''' ''onto'')  +  ('''\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0443''' ''bottom'') \u2192 ('''\u0434\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0443''' ''downwards''); ('''\u0437''' ''off'') + ('''\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0443''' ''afar'') \u2192 ('''\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0443'''  ''afar-off'') . As well, note that adverbs are mostly placed before the verbs they modify: \"\u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u043d \u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0456\u0432\u0430\u0454.\" (A good son sings nicely/well). There is no specific word order in East Slavic languages.\n* In [[Korean language|Korean]], adverbs are commonly formed by replacing the -\ub2e4 ending of the dictionary form of a descriptive verb with \uac8c. So, \uc27d\ub2e4 (easy) becomes \uc27d\uac8c (easily). They are also formed by replacing the \ud558\ub2e4 of some compound verbs with \ud788, e.g. \uc548\ub155\ud558\ub2e4 (peaceful) > \uc548\ub155\ud788 (peacefully).\n* In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the same word usually serves as adjective and adverb: ''iyi bir k\u0131z'' (\"a good girl\"), ''iyi anlamak'' (\"to understand well'').\n* In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], adverbs end in the word \"\u5730\uff08\u7684\uff09\".\n* In [[Persian language|Persian]], many adjectives and adverbs have the same form such as \"\u062e\u0648\u0628\", \"\u0633\u0631\u06cc\u0639\", \"\u062a\u0646\u062f\" so there is no obvious way to recognise them out of context. The only exceptions are Arabic adverbs with a \"\u0627\u064b\" suffix such as \"\u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631\u0627\u064b\" and \"\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u0627\u064b\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category:Adverbs by type]]\n* [[Prepositional adverb]]\n* [[Pronominal adverb]]\n* [[Grammatical conjunction]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Ernst, Thomas. 2002.

Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc., answering questions such as ''how?'', ''in what way?'', ''when?'', ''where?'', and ''to what extent?''.

For example, in the sentences ''She gave birth naturally'' and ''Naturally, she gave birth'', the word ''naturally'' has different meanings: in the first sentence, as a verb-modifying adverb, it means \"in a natural manner\", while in the second sentence, as a sentential adverb, it means something like \"of course\".\n\nWords like ''very'' afford another example. We can say ''Perry is very fast'', but not ''Perry very won the race''. These words can modify adjectives but not verbs. On the other hand, there are words like ''here'' and ''there'' that cannot modify adjectives. We can say ''The sock looks good there'' but not ''It is a there beautiful sock''. The fact that many adverbs can be used in more than one of these functions can confuse the issue, and it may seem like splitting hairs to say that a single adverb is really two or more words that serve different functions. However, this distinction can be useful, especially when considering adverbs like ''naturally'' that have different meanings in their different functions. [[Rodney Huddleston]] distinguishes between a ''word'' and a ''lexicogrammatical-word''.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Huddleston\n  | first = Rodney\n  | authorlink = Rodney Huddleston\n  | title = English Grammar: An Outline\n  | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n  | location = Cambridge\n  | year = 1988\n  | page = 7\n  | doi = 10.2277/0521311527\n  | isbn = 0-521-32311-8 }}</ref>\n\nGrammarians find difficulty categorizing [[Affirmative and negative|negating words]], such as the English ''not''. Although traditionally listed as an adverb, this word does not behave grammatically like any other, and it probably should be placed in a class of its own.<ref>[[Guglielmo Cinque|Cinque, Guglielmo]].  1999. ''Adverbs and functional heads\u2014a cross linguistic perspective''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref><ref>Haegeman, Liliane. 1995. ''The syntax of negation''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\n==In specific languages==\n* In [[Dutch language|Dutch]] adverbs have the basic form of their corresponding [[adjective]]s and are not inflected (though they sometimes can be [[Comparison (grammar)|compared]]).\n* In [[German language|German]] the term ''Adverb'' is differently defined than in the English language. German adverbs form a group of noninflectable words (though a few can be [[Comparison (grammar)|compared]]). An English ''adverb'' which is derived from an adjective is arranged in German under the adjectives with ''adverbial use'' in the sentence. The others are also called adverbs in the German language.\n* In [[Scandinavian languages]], adverbs are typically derived from adjectives by adding the suffix '-t', which makes it identical to the adjective's neuter form. Scandinavian adjectives, like English ones, are inflected in terms of comparison by adding '-ere'/'-are' (comparative) or '-est'/'-ast' (superlative). In inflected forms of adjectives, the '-t' is absent. [[Periphrastic]] comparison is also possible.\n* In [[Romance languages]], many adverbs are formed from adjectives (often the feminine form) by adding '-mente' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Italian language|Italian]]) or '-ment' ([[French language|French]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) (from [[Latin]] ''mens, mentis'': mind, intelligence, or [[suffix]] ''-mentum'', result or way of action). Other adverbs are single forms which are invariable.\n* In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], almost all adverbs are simply the masculine singular form of the corresponding adjective, one notable exception being ''bine'' (\"well\") / ''bun'' (\"good\"). However, there are some Romanian adverbs built from certain masculine singular nouns using the suffix ''\"-e\u0219te\"'', such as the following ones: ''b\u0103ie\u021b-e\u0219te'' (boyishly), ''tiner-e\u0219te'' (youthfully), ''b\u0103rb\u0103t-e\u0219te'' (manly), ''fr\u0103\u021b-e\u0219te'' (brotherly), etc.\n* [[Interlingua]] also forms adverbs by adding '-mente' to the adjective. If an adjective ends in ''c'', the adverbial ending is '-amente'. A few short, invariable adverbs, such as ''ben'', \"well\", and ''mal'', \"badly\", are available and widely used.\n* In [[Esperanto]], adverbs are not formed from adjectives but are made by adding '-e' directly to the word root. Thus, from ''bon'' are derived ''bone'', \"well\", and ''bona'', \"good\". See also: [[special Esperanto adverbs]].\n* In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] adverbs are formed from adjectives of any degree through the suffixes ''-ul/\u00fcl'' and ''-an/en'' depending on the adjective: ''sz\u00e9p'' (beautiful) \u2192 ''sz\u00e9pen'' (beautifully) or the comparative ''szebb'' (more beautiful) \u2192 ''szebben'' (more beautifully)\n* [[Modern Standard Arabic]] forms adverbs by adding the indefinite accusative ending '-an' to the root: ''kathiir-'', \"many\", becomes ''kathiiran'' \"much\".  However, Arabic often avoids adverbs by using a [[cognate accusative]] followed by an adjective.\n* [[Austronesian languages]] generally form [[comparative]] adverbs by repeating the root (as in [[Wiki|WikiWiki]]) like the plural noun.\n* [[Japanese language|Japanese]] forms adverbs from verbal adjectives by adding  /ku/ (\u304f) to the stem (haya- \"rapid\" hayai \"quick/early\", hayakatta \"was quick\", hayaku \"quickly\") and from [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] adjectives by placing /ni/ (\u306b) after the adjective instead of the copula /na/ (\u306a) or /no/ (\u306e) (rippa \"splendid\", rippa ni \"splendidly\"). The derivations are quite productive, but from a few adjectives, adverbs may not be derived.\n* In the [[Celtic languages]], an adverbial form is often made by preceding the adjective with a preposition: ''go'' in [[Irish language|Irish]] or ''gu'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]], meaning 'until'. In [[Cornish language|Cornish]], ''yn'' is used, meaning 'in'.\n* In [[Modern Greek]], an adverb is most commonly made by adding the endings <-\u03b1> or <-\u03c9\u03c2> to the root of an adjective. Often, the adverbs formed from a common root using each of these endings have slightly different meanings. So, <\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2> (<t\u00e9leios>, meaning \"perfect\" and \"complete\") yields <\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1> (<t\u00e9leia>, \"perfectly\") and <\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03c2> (<tele\u00edos>, \"completely\"). Not all adjectives can be transformed into adverbs by using both endings. <\u0393\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2> (<gr\u00edgoros>, \"rapid\") becomes <\u03b3\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1> (<gr\u00edgora>, \"rapidly\"), but not normally *<\u03b3\u03c1\u03b7\u03b3\u03cc\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2> (*<grig\u00f3ros>). When the <-\u03c9\u03c2> ending is used to transform an adjective whose tonal accent is on the third syllable from the end, such as <\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2> (<ep\u00edsimos>, \"official\"), the corresponding adjective is accented on the second syllable from the end; compare <\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1> (<ep\u00edsima>) and <\u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03ae\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2> (<epis\u00edmos>), which both mean \"officially\". There are also other endings with particular and restricted use as <-\u03af>, <-\u03b5\u03af>, <-\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af>, etc. For example, <\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03af> (<atimorit\u00ed>, \"with impunity\") and <\u03b1\u03c3\u03c5\u03b6\u03b7\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03af> (<asyzitit\u00ed>, \"indisputably\"); <\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b5\u03af> (<autolexe\u00ed> \"word for word\") and <\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b5\u03af> (<autostigme\u00ed>, \"in no time\"); <\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af> [<anglist\u00ed> \"in English (language)\"] and <\u03c0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af> (<papagalist\u00ed>, \"by rote\"); etc.\n* In [[Latvian language|Latvian]], an adverb is formed from an adjective by changing the masculine or feminine adjective endings -s and -a to -i. \"Labs\", meaning \"good\", becomes \"labi\" for \"well\". Latvian adverbs have a particular use in expressions meaning \"to speak\" or \"to understand\" a language. Rather than use the noun meaning \"Latvian/English/Russian\", the adverb formed form these words is used. \"Es run\u0101ju latviski/angliski/krieviski\" means \"I speak Latvian/English/Russian\" or, literally, \"I speak Latvianly/Englishly/Russianly\". If a noun is required, the expression used means literally \"language of the Latvians/English/Russians\", \"latvie\u0161u/ang\u013cu/krievu valoda\".\n*In [[Russian language|Russian]], and analogously in [[Ukrainian Language|Ukrainian]]  and some other [[Slavic languages]], most adverbs are formed by removing the adjectival suffices \"-\u0438\u0439\" \"-\u0430\" or \"-\u0435\" from an adjective, and replacing them with the adverbial \"-\u043e\". For example, in Ukrainian, \"\u0448\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0438\u0439\", \"\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430\", and \"\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0435\" (fast, nice, tasty) become \"\u0448\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043a\u043e\", \"\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e\", and \"\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e\" (quickly, nicely, tastefully), while in Russian, \"\u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044b\u0439\", \"\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439\" and \"\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439\" (quick, good, wonderful) become \"\u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\", \"\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\", \"\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\" (quickly, well, wonderfully). Another wide group of adverbs are formed by gluing a [[preposition]] to an oblique case form. In Ukrainian, for example, ('''\u0434\u043e''' ''onto'')  +  ('''\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0443''' ''bottom'') \u2192 ('''\u0434\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0443''' ''downwards''); ('''\u0437''' ''off'') + ('''\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0443''' ''afar'') \u2192 ('''\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0443'''  ''afar-off'') . As well, note that adverbs are mostly placed before the verbs they modify: \"\u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u043d \u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0456\u0432\u0430\u0454.\" (A good son sings nicely/well). There is no specific word order in East Slavic languages.\n* In [[Korean language|Korean]], adverbs are commonly formed by replacing the -\ub2e4 ending of the dictionary form of a descriptive verb with \uac8c. So, \uc27d\ub2e4 (easy) becomes \uc27d\uac8c (easily). They are also formed by replacing the \ud558\ub2e4 of some compound verbs with \ud788, e.g. \uc548\ub155\ud558\ub2e4 (peaceful) > \uc548\ub155\ud788 (peacefully).\n* In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the same word usually serves as adjective and adverb: ''iyi bir k\u0131z'' (\"a good girl\"), ''iyi anlamak'' (\"to understand well'').\n* In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], adverbs end in the word \"\u5730\uff08\u7684\uff09\".\n* In [[Persian language|Persian]], many adjectives and adverbs have the same form such as \"\u062e\u0648\u0628\", \"\u0633\u0631\u06cc\u0639\", \"\u062a\u0646\u062f\" so there is no obvious way to recognise them out of context. The only exceptions are Arabic adverbs with a \"\u0627\u064b\" suffix such as \"\u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631\u0627\u064b\" and \"\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u0627\u064b\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category:Adverbs by type]]\n* [[Prepositional adverb]]\n* [[Pronominal adverb]]\n* [[Grammatical conjunction]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Ernst, Thomas. 2002.
