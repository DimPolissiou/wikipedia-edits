In the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885|Redistribution of Seats Act of 1885]] Berkshire was divided into three county constituencies, [[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Northern (Abingdon)]], Southern (Newbury), and [[Wokingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Eastern (Wokingham)]], and two [[borough constituency|borough constituencies]], [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]] and [[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|New Windsor]], each returning one member.\n\nThe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] have held the constituency for all but seventeen years since the creation of the seat - only three spells of [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], or [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]], majorities have intersected their control. In [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], the party held the largest majority in the seat since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]] at 46%, before being reduced to 40.1% in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]].\n\nSince the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 election]], the Liberal Democrats have been one of the two largest parties in the constituency. They most recently gained the seat at the [[1993 Newbury by-election|1993 by-election]], holding it until [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]] where it was regained by the Conservatives.\n\nThe constituency in 2010 produced the third lowest share of the vote for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] (4.3%), one of five lost deposits for Labour nationally, below the 5% of the vote deposit threshold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/elections/results/general_elections|title=General Election Results from the Electoral Commission}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Other lost Labour deposits took place in Eastbourne, Somerton & Frome, Cornwall North and Westmorland & Lonsdale|group= n}} In 2017, Labour earned its highest share of the vote in Newbury since the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 election]] with 14.1% of the vote.\n\nIt was estimated that the constituency voted 51% in favour of remaining in the European Union during the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum on EU membership]], with 49% voting to leave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/cgi-bin/seatdetails.py?seat=Newbury|title=Newbury|work=Electoral Calculus|accessdate=5 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{for|European Elections|Newbury, Berkshire}}\n\n== Boundaries and boundary changes ==\n[[File:Newbury election results (smaller).png|right|thumb|320x320px|A graph plotting the election results for Newbury.([[:File:Newbury election results.png|larger version and key]])]]\n'''1885\u20131918''': The constituency was created as the Southern or Newbury Division of Berkshire under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]], when the three-member Parliamentary County of [[Berkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Berkshire]] was divided into the three single-member constituencies of [[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Abingdon,]] Newbury and [[Wokingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wokingham.]] It comprised the Boroughs of Newbury and Reading, the Sessional Divisions of Ilsley, Lambourn, Newbury (including Hungerford), and Reading (except the parishes of East Swallowfield and West Swallowfield), and part of the Sessional Division of Wokingham.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/publicgeneralac01walegoog|title=The public general acts|last=Great Britain|first=Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales|publisher=Proprietors of the Law Journal Reports, 1884|others=unknown library|language=English}}</ref>  Only non-resident freeholders of the municipal borough Reading (which comprised the Parliamentary Borough of [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]]) were entitled to vote.\n\n'''1918\u20131950''': The Boroughs of Newbury and Wokingham, the Rural Districts of Hungerford and Newbury, and parts of the Rural Districts of Bradfield and Wokingham.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=Boundaries of parliamentary constituencies 1885-1972;|last=S.|first=Craig, Fred W.|date=1972|publisher=Political Reference Publications|isbn=0900178094|location=Chichester|oclc=539011}}</ref>\n\nExtended eastwards, with the addition of Wokingham and surrounding areas from the abolished Wokingham Division of Berkshire.

In the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885|Redistribution of Seats Act of 1885]] Berkshire was divided into three county constituencies, [[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Northern (Abingdon)]], Southern (Newbury), and [[Wokingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Eastern (Wokingham)]], and two [[borough constituency|borough constituencies]], [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]] and [[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|New Windsor]], each returning one member.\n\nThe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] have held the constituency for all but seventeen years since the creation of the seat - only three spells of [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], or [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]], majorities have intersected their control. In [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], the party held the largest majority in the seat since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]] at 46%, before being reduced to 40.1% in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]].\n\nSince the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 election]], the Liberal Democrats have been one of the two largest parties in the constituency. They most recently gained the seat at the [[1993 Newbury by-election|1993 by-election]], holding it until [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]] where it was regained by the Conservatives.\n\nThe constituency in 2010 produced the third lowest share of the vote for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] (4.3%), one of five lost deposits for Labour nationally, below the 5% of the vote deposit threshold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/elections/results/general_elections|title=General Election Results from the Electoral Commission}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Other lost Labour deposits took place in Eastbourne, Somerton & Frome, Cornwall North and Westmorland & Lonsdale|group= n}} In 2017, Labour earned its highest share of the vote in Newbury since the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 election]] with 14.1% of the vote.\n\nIt was estimated that the constituency voted 51% in favour of remaining in the European Union during the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum on EU membership]], with 49% voting to leave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/cgi-bin/seatdetails.py?seat=Newbury|title=Newbury|work=Electoral Calculus|accessdate=5 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{for|European Elections|Newbury, Berkshire}}\n\n== Boundaries and boundary changes ==\n[[File:Newbury election results (smaller).png|right|thumb|320x320px|A graph plotting the election results for Newbury.([[:File:Newbury election results.png|larger version and key]])]]\n'''1885\u20131918''': The constituency was created as the Southern or Newbury Division of Berkshire under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]], when the three-member Parliamentary County of [[Berkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Berkshire]] was divided into the three single-member constituencies of [[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Abingdon,]] Newbury and [[Wokingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wokingham.]] It comprised the Boroughs of Newbury and Reading, the Sessional Divisions of Ilsley, Lambourn, Newbury (including Hungerford), and Reading (except the parishes of East Swallowfield and West Swallowfield), and part of the Sessional Division of Wokingham.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/publicgeneralac01walegoog|title=The public general acts|last=Great Britain|first=Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales|publisher=Proprietors of the Law Journal Reports, 1884|others=unknown library|language=English}}</ref>  Only non-resident freeholders of the municipal borough Reading (which comprised the Parliamentary Borough of [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]]) were entitled to vote.\n\n'''1918\u20131950''': The Boroughs of Newbury and Wokingham, the Rural Districts of Hungerford and Newbury, and parts of the Rural Districts of Bradfield and Wokingham.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=Boundaries of parliamentary constituencies 1885-1972;|last=S.|first=Craig, Fred W.|date=1972|publisher=Political Reference Publications|isbn=0900178094|location=Chichester|oclc=539011}}</ref>\n\nExtended eastwards, with the addition of Wokingham and surrounding areas from the abolished Wokingham Division of Berkshire.

At this meeting, the Inter-Varsity Association and the International Students Bureau (which organised student travel and had been lobbying for a national body) agreed to merge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/prize-esd/2016laureates/nus|title=National Union of Students|last=https://plus.google.com/+UNESCO|date=2016-09-14|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nusconnect.org.uk/nus-uk/who-we-are/our-story|title=Our story @ NUS Connect|website=www.nusconnect.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nFounding members included the unions of [[University of Birmingham]], [[Birkbeck College|Birkbeck, University of London]], [[London School of Economics]], [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] (who first left in 1923 and have subsequently rejoined and left three times, the last time being in June 2008), [[King's College London]] (who supplied the first President, [[Ivison Macadam|Sir Ivison Macadam]]) and the [[University of Bristol]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/2945/students-start-voting-nus-membership/|title=Students start voting on NUS membership {{!}} Imperial News {{!}} Imperial College London|website=Imperial News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n===Politicisation and Broad Left, 1968\u20131982===\nIn the aftermath of the [[Second World War]] and with the onset of the [[Cold War]], the National Union of Students had adopted a \"no politics\" clause in its charter in an attempt to distance itself from its 1930s flirtations with [[communism]]. During the 1950s it had thus concerned itself with collective bargaining over student grants, teaching salaries and education. This apolitical consensus was challenged in concert with the international [[protests of 1968]] and as the Cold War intensified.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://eprints.port.ac.uk/16958/1/ERH_National_Union_of_Students_1958_1968_post_print.pdf|publisher=Jodi Burkett|title=The National Union of Students and transnational solidarity,1958-1968|date=26 January 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828105606/http://eprints.port.ac.uk/16958/1/ERH_National_Union_of_Students_1958_1968_post_print.pdf|archivedate=28 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> At the 1969 NUS conference, then president [[Trevor Fisk]] came up against [[Jack Straw]] (then close to [[Bert Ramelson]] of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], but much later Foreign Secretary under the [[New Labour]] government of [[Tony Blair]]) over the issue. Straw supported student protests against US military involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], while Fisk advocated neutrality; Straw's side won and the \"no politics\" clause was removed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nus.org.uk/en/who-we-are/our-history/a-brief-history/|publisher=National Union of Students|title=A Brief History|date=26 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nA new era began for the NUS, where political agitation and protest became institutionalized. Straw was followed up as president by [[Digby Jacks]], also representing the [[Radical Student Alliance]] (formed in 1966 by [[Fergus Nicholson]]) and a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. According to contemporary British government reports, the RSA was connected to the Trotskyite-led [[Vietnam Solidarity Campaign]] and had close links with the ''[[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund]]'' (organising a protest following [[Rudi Dutschke]]'s shooting).

At the same time, the NUS adopted a [[NUS No Platform Policy|No Platform policy]]; a concept pioneered by the [[International Marxist Group|IMG]] in 1972; to stifle the campus organisation and speech of nationalistic British groups that it declared to be \"racist or fascist\". At the time this was aimed at the [[British National Front|National Front]] and the [[Monday Club]] (a faction in the [[Federation of Conservative Students]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://hatfulofhistory.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/by-whatever-means-necessary-the-origins-of-the-no-platform-policy/|publisher=Hatful of History|title=\u2018By whatever means necessary\u2019: The origins of the \u2018no platform\u2019 policy|date=26 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe union was also involved in affairs in [[Northern Ireland]], where most higher education establishments there were members of both the NUS and the [[Union of Students in Ireland]], though this differed from case to case. Indeed, two presidents of the NUS earlier on in the 1960s were from [[Queen's University, Belfast]]; T. William Savage and T. Geoff Martin. The 1968-69 unrest in Northern Ireland saw the onset of [[The Troubles]] and a sectarian divisiveness come to the fore. After members of the QUBSU organised a protest against politician [[William Craig (Northern Ireland politician)|Bill Craig]], some members such as [[Bernadette Devlin]], [[Eamonn McCann]] and [[Michael Farrell (activist)|Michael Farrell]] decided to found the Trotskyite-group [[People's Democracy (Ireland)|People's Democracy]] in 1968, which played a role in the [[Northern Ireland civil rights movement]]. Following a meeting in Galway in 1972, to combat divisions it was agreed that a group called the [[NUS-USI]] would be founded with dual-membership to cover Northern Ireland.\n\nOne of the NUS' protest campaigns which was of particular significance during the 1970s and the 1980s was the boycott campaign against [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] governed [[South Africa]] as part of the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]].<ref name=\"aa\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nus.org.uk/en/news/the-anti-apartheid-movement-50-years-on/|publisher=NUS|title=The Anti-Apartheid Movement: 50 Years On|date=26 January 2016}}</ref>  In 1970, NUS vice president Tony Klug visited South Africa and met with [[Steve Biko]] of the [[South African Students' Organisation|SASO]] among others.<ref name=\"aa\"/> Members also attempted to disrupt South African rugby and cricket matches in the United Kingdom during the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/mike-terry-campaigner-who-led-the-anti-apartheid-movement-for-two-decades-1059367.html|publisher=The Independent|title=Mike Terry: Campaigner who led the Anti-Apartheid Movement for two decades|date=26 January 2016}}</ref> In the 1980s, the NUS played a significant role in getting [[Barclay's Bank]] to divest from South Africa, attacking it as \"[[Boer]]clay Bank\".<ref name=\"aa\"/>\n\nThroughout this period, the NUS presidency was dominated by the [[Broad Left]], within which the Communist Party of Great Britain (where Eurocommunism was most popular among students rather than the pro-Soviet \"[[Tankie]]\" anti-revisionists) predominated and usually supplied the president, but were backed up Labour and the Liberals. They did so to work as a voting bloc against both the Conservatives and [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]]. The first of these Broad Left presidents was [[Charles Clarke]] (later a Home Secretary under Blair) who as a member of the [[Clause Four Group]],  won the [[National Organisation of Labour Students]] back from Militant influence. Other presidents included [[Sue Slipman]] (who began on the [[Eurocommunist]] wing on the Communist Party of Great Britain but ended up a founding member of the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] by 1981), [[Trevor Phillips]] (a Broad Left independent and the first black NUS president, who later led the race relations group the [[Runnymede Trust]]) and [[David Aaronovitch]] (who was then a Eurocommunist, but later a journalist aligned to [[neoconservatism]]).\n\n===Labour Students presidency, 1982\u20132000===\nFrom 1982 with the election of [[Neil Stewart (British politician)|Neil Stewart]], until [[Andrew Pakes]] stood down in 2000, the presidency of the National Union of Students was controlled by the National Organisation of Labour Students, which shortened its name to [[Labour Students]] in 1994.\n\n===History in the 21st century===\n\n====Fairtrade====\n{{Citation needed-span|date=June 2016|text=The '''Fairtrade NUS Campaign''' was started by students at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in autumn 2005.

Before the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]], the NUS invited candidates sign a [[Vote for Students pledge|pledge not to raise tuition fees]], receiving over 1000 signatories from prospective parliamentary candidates. This became a very high-profile campaign when many Liberal Democrat MPs, who all signed individual NUS pledges stating they would vote against any rise in tuition fees if elected, had to abstain or do the opposite as part of their coalition agreement.\n\nThe NUS, under new leader [[Aaron Porter]], organised [[2010 student protest in London|a national protest attended by thousands]] in November 2010, demanding an end to education cuts. The march route passed [[Whitehall]] and the [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative Party]] headquarters at [[Millbank Tower]]. As they marched past the building, some protesters diverted in to the courtyard of [[Millbank Tower]] and began an occupation of the building.\n\nWith an attendance of over 50,000 people, it was the largest British demonstration since the [[February 15, 2003, anti-war protests|Iraq War protest]].

In addition to these political factions, interest groups such as the [[Federation of Student Islamic Societies]] and the [[Union of Jewish Students]] are deeply involved in the internal democratic processes of the NUS.\n\n==NUS Services==\n{{Citation needed-span|date=June 2016|text=NUS Services provides collective purchasing, support and marketing services to NUS-affiliated students' unions.

Officers of NUS are elected at conferences by delegates chosen by affiliated unions of NUS. Critics, from both within and outside the student movement, have argued that consultation by unions with their members over who should represent the students' union at national conferences is often minimal, and some have argued in favour of changes to the NUS constitution that would result in a one-member-one-vote policy.<ref>{{cite web|title=One Member One Vote Working Group Findings|url=http://www.theyworkforstudents.co.uk/uploads/6/2/1/0/6210998/nc2012_omov_report.pdf|website=They Work for Students|publisher=Theyworkforstudents.com|accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=#NUSnc14 - And our one member one vote motion.|url=http://www.yusu.org/your-union/blogs/entry/1319|website=University of York Students' Union|publisher=University of York Students' Union|accessdate=22 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222131054/http://www.yusu.org/your-union/blogs/entry/1319|archivedate=22 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe NUS has also been criticised for prioritisation of NUS Extra over campaigning on issues which affect students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epigram.org.uk/view.php?id=906 |title=NUS: Extra rip-off for students? |publisher=Epigram.org.uk |accessdate=31 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722200944/http://www.epigram.org.uk/view.php?id=906 |archivedate=22 July 2011 }}</ref> Despite it being NUS policy that none of the discounts on the original free NUS card would be moved to NUS Extra, proposed by [[Cambridge University Students' Union]], NUS Treasurer Dave Lewis did not follow policy and removed the discounts from the original free NUS card.<ref>[http://resource.nusonline.co.uk/media/resource/CD22_Resolutions.pdf CD22_Resolutions] resource.nusonline.co.uk {{Dead link|date = September 2013}}</ref>\n\nOther critics have focussed on the organisation's perceived failure to campaign effectively on student issues such as [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]] and prescription costs,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/issue/comment/nus-should-we-vote-to-disaffiliate/ |title=NUS \u2013 Should we vote to disaffiliate? &#124; The Cambridge Student |publisher=Tcs.cam.ac.uk |date=21 January 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129040138/http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/issue/comment/nus-should-we-vote-to-disaffiliate/ |archive-date=29 January 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and have advocated that students and unions coordinate independently of the NUS to campaign on the national stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.free-education.org.uk/?p=653 |title=NUS Trustee Board: hammering in the final nails\u2026 : Education Not For Sale |publisher=Free-education.org.uk |date=14 December 2009 |accessdate=31 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807041847/http://www.free-education.org.uk/?p=653 |archivedate=7 August 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cambridgetab.co.uk/news/chigbos-guilty-of-election-abuses/ |title=Chigbo Guilty Of Election Abuses \u00ab THE TAB \u2013 www.cambridgetab.co.uk \u2013 All the latest Cambridge University news online |publisher=Cambridgetab.co.uk |accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Financial crisis===\nIn the mid-2000s, NUS faced a financial crisis, caused by a coinciding of spiraling expenditure and decreasing income.

According to contemporary British government reports, the RSA was connected to the Trotskyite-led [[Vietnam Solidarity Campaign]] and had close links with the ''[[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund]]'' (organising a protest following [[Rudi Dutschke]]'s shooting).

Indeed, two presidents of the NUS earlier on in the 1960s were from [[Queen's University, Belfast]]; T. William Savage and T. Geoff Martin. The 1968-69 unrest in Northern Ireland saw the onset of [[The Troubles]] and a sectarian divisiveness come to the fore. After members of the QUBSU organised a protest against politician [[William Craig (Northern Ireland politician)|Bill Craig]], some members such as [[Bernadette Devlin]], [[Eamonn McCann]] and [[Michael Farrell (activist)|Michael Farrell]] decided to found the Trotskyite-group [[People's Democracy (Ireland)|People's Democracy]] in 1968, which played a role in the [[Northern Ireland civil rights movement]]. Following a meeting in Galway in 1972, to combat divisions it was agreed that a group called the [[NUS-USI]] would be founded with dual-membership to cover Northern Ireland.\n\nOne of the NUS' protest campaigns which was of particular significance during the 1970s and the 1980s was the boycott campaign against [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] governed [[South Africa]] as part of the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]].<ref name=\"aa\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nus.org.uk/en/news/the-anti-apartheid-movement-50-years-on/|publisher=NUS|title=The Anti-Apartheid Movement: 50 Years On|date=26 January 2016}}</ref>  In 1970, NUS vice president Tony Klug visited South Africa and met with [[Steve Biko]] of the [[South African Students' Organisation|SASO]] among others.<ref name=\"aa\"/> Members also attempted to disrupt South African rugby and cricket matches in the United Kingdom during the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/mike-terry-campaigner-who-led-the-anti-apartheid-movement-for-two-decades-1059367.html|publisher=The Independent|title=Mike Terry: Campaigner who led the Anti-Apartheid Movement for two decades|date=26 January 2016}}</ref> In the 1980s, the NUS played a significant role in getting [[Barclay's Bank]] to divest from South Africa, attacking it as \"[[Boer]]clay Bank\".<ref name=\"aa\"/>\n\nThroughout this period, the NUS presidency was dominated by the [[Broad Left]], within which the Communist Party of Great Britain (where Eurocommunism was most popular among students rather than the pro-Soviet \"[[Tankie]]\" anti-revisionists) predominated and usually supplied the president, but were backed up Labour and the Liberals. They did so to work as a voting bloc against both the Conservatives and [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]]. The first of these Broad Left presidents was [[Charles Clarke]] (later a Home Secretary under Blair) who as a member of the [[Clause Four Group]],  won the [[National Organisation of Labour Students]] back from Militant influence. Other presidents included [[Sue Slipman]] (who began on the [[Eurocommunist]] wing on the Communist Party of Great Britain but ended up a founding member of the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] by 1981), [[Trevor Phillips]] (a Broad Left independent and the first black NUS president, who later led the race relations group the [[Runnymede Trust]]) and [[David Aaronovitch]] (who was then a Eurocommunist, but later a journalist aligned to [[neoconservatism]]).\n\n===Labour Students presidency, 1982\u20132000===\nFrom 1982 with the election of [[Neil Stewart (British politician)|Neil Stewart]], until [[Andrew Pakes]] stood down in 2000, the presidency of the National Union of Students was controlled by the National Organisation of Labour Students, which shortened its name to [[Labour Students]] in 1994.\n\n===History in the 21st century===\n\n====Fairtrade====\n{{Citation needed-span|date=June 2016|text=The '''Fairtrade NUS Campaign''' was started by students at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in autumn 2005.

Before the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]], the NUS invited candidates sign a [[Vote for Students pledge|pledge not to raise tuition fees]], receiving over 1000 signatories from prospective parliamentary candidates. This became a very high-profile campaign when many Liberal Democrat MPs, who all signed individual NUS pledges stating they would vote against any rise in tuition fees if elected, had to abstain or do the opposite as part of their coalition agreement.\n\nThe NUS, under new leader [[Aaron Porter]], organised [[2010 student protest in London|a national protest attended by thousands]] in November 2010, demanding an end to education cuts. The march route passed [[Whitehall]] and the [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative Party]] headquarters at [[Millbank Tower]]. As they marched past the building, some protesters diverted in to the courtyard of [[Millbank Tower]] and began an occupation of the building.\n\nWith an attendance of over 50,000 people, it was the largest British demonstration since the [[February 15, 2003, anti-war protests|Iraq War protest]].

Officers of NUS are elected at conferences by delegates chosen by affiliated unions of NUS.

Though, other commercial car washes came before it, the first semi-automatic car wash in the United States made its debut in 1946, and from there, the industry has grown in both size and sophistication.\n\n===1946===\nThe start of the history of car washing dated back into 1914. People used manpower to push or move the cars through stages of the process. Eventually, manual car wash operations peaked at 32 drive-through facilities in the United States. Prior to this time, the evolution of car washing was just at the beginning, and that the automatic car washing was born. The first semi-automatic car wash was active for the first time in [[Detroit]], Michigan using automatic pulley systems and manual brushing.<ref name=\"Car Wash Finder\">{{cite web | title=History of the Car Wash | website=Car Wash Finder | url=http://www.carwashfinder.com.au/resources/history-car-wash | accessdate=27 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1955===\nMany things had occurred within 1955 regarding car washing history. A businessman named Dan Hanna was encouraged by the car washers in Detroit, operated his own materials, then eventually made his own car wash called the Rub-a-Dub in [[Oregon]]. In 1957, he formed the Hanna Enterprises and eventually reached about 31 car washes in America. In 1959, Hanna operated his wash rack until he made the first mechanized car washing system. As the news spread throughout the city, so did his business.<ref name=\"Car Wash Finder\"/>\n\n===1960s===\nBy the mid 1960s Hanna Enterprises had established itself as the main source innovator and the manufacturer of car washing equipments and materials. Over time, Hanna had made several machines that will be the first to do the main requirements over car washing, this includes the Wrap-Around Brush, Roller-on-demand Conveyor belt, soft cloth friction washing, several ways to wash the [[tires]], and a recirculating water system. With that said, Hanna Enterprises have become the largest vehicle washing equipment manufacturer.<ref name=\"Car Wash Finder\"/>\n\n===1970s===\nIn the 1970s it was a difficult time for the car washing industry, as the result of the [[gasoline]] prices increasing rapidly. Still, Hanna Enterprises made another two inventions during this time: the automatic wheel cleaner, and the polish'n'wax.<ref name=\"Car Wash Finder\"/>\n\n\n==Categories==\n[[File:Broadways Car Wash.jpg|thumb|An in-bay automatic car wash performing a friction wash pass]]\nWhile there are many types of car washes, most fall into the following categories:\n*Car wash lift, where cars are placed in a car wash lift where cars can then be washed by employees. <ref name=\"Lam Tran\">{{cite web | url=http://www.sontunglam.com/tin-tuc/mo-tram-rua-xe-can-gi-kinh-nghiem-cho-nguoi-mo | title=M\u1ede TR\u1ea0M R\u1eecA XE C\u1ea6N G\u00cc ?

Sometimes these systems are mounted on trailers, on trucks, or in vans. Generally these operators also have a generator to run a shop vac., buffers, and other tools as well.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n[[Machine|Mechanized]] car washes, especially those with brushes, were once avoided by some meticulous car owners because of the risk of damaging the finish. Paint finishes have improved as have car washing processes, and this perception of vehicle damage is much less prevalent today.  However, this perception was the motive behind the rise of facilities utilizing \"brushless\" (cloth) and \"touch-free\" (high-pressure water) equipment, as well as modern \"foam\" washing wheels made of closed cell foam.\n\nIn today's modern car wash facilities, whether tunnel, in-bay automatic or self-serve, soaps and other cleaning solutions used are designed to loosen and eliminate dirt and grime. This is in contrast to earlier times, when [[hydrofluoric acid]], a hazardous chemical, was commonly used as a cleaning agent in the industry by some operators.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}  There has been a strong move in the industry to shift to safer cleaning solutions. Most car wash facilities are required by law to treat and/or reuse their water and may be required to maintain waste-water discharge permits, in contrast to unregulated facilities or even driveway washing (at one's home), where waste-water can end up in the storm drain and, eventually, in streams, rivers, and lakes.\n\n==Self-serve car wash==\n[[File:Self-service car was in Seattle, Washington.jpg|thumb|right|A multi-bay, coin-operated self-service car wash in Seattle, Washington]]\nA simple and automated type of car wash that is typically coin-operated or [[Token (numismatics)|token]]-operated self-service system. Newer self-service car washes offer the ability to pay with [[credit card]]s or [[loyalty card]]s.

When [[customer]]s insert coins or tokens into the [[Control system|controller]], they can choose options such as [[soap]], tire cleaner, wax or clear water rinse, all dispensed from the sprayer, or scrub the vehicle with the foam brush. The number of coins or tokens inserted determines the amount of time customers have to operate the equipment; in most instances, a minimum number of coins is necessary to start the equipment. These facilities are often equipped with separate [[vacuum cleaner|vacuum]] stations that allow customers to clean the [[upholstery]] and rugs inside their cars. Some self-service car washes offer hand-held dryers, a somewhat new feature.\n\n==Automatic car wash==\n[[File:Inside a car wash.jpg|thumb|Rotating brushes inside a conveyor car-wash]]\n\n===Conveyorized/tunnel car wash===\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=January 2018}}\nThe first conveyorized automatic car wash appeared in Hollywood, CA in 1940.Conveyorized automatic car washes consist of tunnel-like buildings into which customers (or attendants) drive.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nSome car washes have their customers pay through a computerized ''POS'', or [[point of sale]] unit, also known as an \"automatic cashier\", which may take the place of a human cashier. The mechanism inputs the wash [[Price Look-Up|PLU]] into a master [[computer]] or a tunnel controller<!-- tunnel controller is the generic term, Tunnel Master is a specific brand --> automatically. When the sale is automated, after paying the car is put into a line-up called the stack or queue. The stack moves sequentially, so the wash knows what each car purchased. After pulling up to the tunnel entrance, an attendant usually guides the customer onto the conveyor. At some washes, the system will send the correct number of rollers automatically, based on tire sensors. The tire sensor lets the wash know where the wheels are and how far apart they are. On other systems the employee may guide the customer on and press a 'Send Car' button on the tunnel controller, to manually send the rollers which push the car through.\n\nPrior to entering the automated section of the wash tunnel, attendants may prewash customers' cars. This process can consist of a wide range of manual cleaning procedures, including applying specialized bug removing cleaning agents to various parts of the car, performing a manual high pressure prewash (possibly focusing on areas which the tunnel cannot sufficiently clean), and using manual brushes to scrub down areas of the vehicle which are difficult for the equipment to clean. Manual prewashing may be more extensive if a vehicle has mud or if the customer purchases an upgrade.\n\nWhen the customer is on the conveyor, the attendant (or signage) will instruct the customer to put the vehicle into neutral, release all [[brakes]], and refrain from steering. Failure to do so can cause an accident on the conveyor. The rollers come up behind the tires, pushing the car through a photogate, which measures vehicle length, allowing the controller to tailor the wash to each individual vehicle. Some car washes may also use ultrasonic profiling systems to determine the height or width of a vehicle, or to detect open pick-up truck beds. The equipment [[Structural system|frame]], or [[arch]]es, vary in number and type.\n[[File:Auto wash interior.jpg|thumb|A vehicle exiting the friction zone of the wash. Visible are side brushes, wrap-around brushes, the conveyor, and a high pressure rinse arch.]]\n\nThe car wash will typically start cleaning with chemicals called presoaks applied through special arches. These arches often use nozzles positioned to spray chemicals in a bi-directional pattern.  In many cases, presoak arches are designed to foam the presoak prior to its application to the car. They may apply a higher pH (mild [[alkali]]) followed by a lower [[pH]] (mild [[acid]]) or vice versa. Chemical formulas and concentrations may also vary based upon seasonal dirt and film on vehicles, as well as exterior temperature, and other factors.  Chemical dilution and application works in combination with removal systems based on either high pressure water, friction, or a combination of both.  One or more sets CTAs, or \"chemical tire applicators,\" are often found near the presoak arches.  These will apply specialized formulations, which remove brake dust and build up from the surface of the wheels and tires.  In many cases, CTAs will only activate if the customer has purchased a wheel cleaning upgrade. Special presoaks may be applied if the customer purchases an upgrade. Extra presoaks are typically applied via a \"lava\" or \"sheet\"-style foamer to provide more of a show for the customer.<ref>{{Citation|title = Carwash Easy and Go lavaboog|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-buFWCvjPo|date = 17 December 2014|accessdate = 16 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the presoak application, a car wash tunnel's layout can vary greatly.  In some car washes, presoak application is followed by an empty space, or idle zone.  This provides time for the presoak to loosen dirt on the car.  In many cases, wheel cleaning equipment, such as sill brushes or high pressure wheel blasters, are placed in the idle zone.  A sill brush (also known as a wheel brush or tire brush) consists of an 8-foot-long brush assembly which is pushed against the car's wheels and door sill area. Sill brushes are typically use flagged bristle, as dirt is usually most heavily concentrated on the lower parts of the car. The material on a sill brush may have alternating lengths or use material which is intentionally mounted off-center to allow wheel surfaces of various depths to be cleaned. Sill brushes rely on the rotation of a customer's car's wheels in order to achieve complete wheel contact. Similarly to the CTAs, wheel brushes often only activate when the customer buys a wheel cleaning upgrade. Some car washes use wheel-rim disc brushes in addition to or in place of sill brushes. These assemblies extend out towards the wheel and follow it at the same speed as the conveyor while rotating at high speeds to clean the wheels. These devices are popular in car washes that use belt conveyors, as a belt conveyor prevents the wheels of a customer's car from rotating and thus renders sill brushes useless for wheel cleaning. Some car washes feature multiple sets of wheel brushes and offer multiple levels of wheel cleaning. Tracking high pressure wheel blasters consist of assemblies with multiple nozzles that follow a car's wheel over a distance. While following a car's wheel, a wheel blaster directs high-pressure water at the wheel. The following motion may be achieved by having the nozzles pivot to face the wheel or by having the nozzles move alongside the car at the same speed as the conveyor. At the end of a car wash's presoak idle zone is often a high pressure arch which direct high pressure water at a vehicle's surface. This may be done \"V-jet\" nozzles, rotating \"turbo\" nozzles, spinning manifolds, and oscillating and/or pivoting manifolds. Some high pressure systems maintain a constant distance from the vehicle to provide more consistent results. Separate high pressure top, wheel, and/or side blasters may be present in place of or supplementary to a high pressure arch.\n\n[[Image:orscarwash.jpg|thumb|A typical \"tunnel\" car wash viewed from the inside of a vehicle]]\n\nFollowing the idle zone and/or high pressure arch (if applicable) is the friction zone.  In the friction zone, a variety of brushes are used to clean all of the vehicle's surfaces.  Wrap-around brushes (wraps) clean the front, sides, and rear of a car.  A set of wraps consists of two offset brushes which are attached to overhead arms which are generally mounted over the center of the tunnel. Some wrap-around brush designs use jointed side-mounted arms to increase the brush's front and rear contact time. Wraps typically rotate with the vehicle's direction of travel. Some wrap-around brushes are capable of switching direction while cleaning the front of a car to prevent customers' license plates from being bent. Wraps are supplemented by side brushes. Side brushes rotate against the vehicle's direction of travel to increase cleaning power. Top brushes are rotating brush assemblies which clean the vehicle's top surfaces. A top brush can face either the entrance or exit of the tunnel to assist in cleaning the car's front or rear. Some specialized top brushes are designed to achieve more contact time with the front or rear of vehicles.<ref>{{Citation|title = ANAC Arnhem test 21-10-2012|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQTu9Z71zvI|date = 21 October 2012|accessdate = 16 January 2016}}</ref> To prevent damage, a top brush can be programmed to retract if an ultrasonic pick-up truck bed detection system detects a pick-up truck with an open bed. In many car washes, top brushes are either supplemented by or replaced with mitters. Mitters are ribbon-like components which suspend cloth strips or sheets over the tunnel while utilizing motion to increase friction against the car's surface. The friction zone may also include specialized front grill and rear brushes. Front grill brushes clean the front, and in many cases, the sides of vehicles. They often appear as side washers with an unusually long and bent arm. Instead of bent arms, some front grill brushes use jointed arms. Rear brushes appear as a specialized tall side washers with long arms that face the entrance of the tunnel. Once a car's mirror passes a rear brush, the brush makes contact with the vehicle's side, where it then continues to engage until the assembly cleans the rear of the car. Additional high pressure components may also be present in the main friction zone.<ref>{{Citation|title = Waschparadies Ulm by carwashTV|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9zWZ_-oxXY|date = 3 March 2011|accessdate = 16 January 2016}}</ref>  Older automatic washes - a majority of which were built prior to 1980 - used to use brushes with soft nylon bristles, which tended to leave a nylon deposit in the shape of a bristle, called brush marks, on the vehicle's paint. Many newer washes use either soft cloth (which is not harmful to a car's finish, as long as it is flushed with plenty of water to remove the grit from previous washes) or a closed cell foam brush, which does not hold dirt or water, thus is far less likely to harm any painted finish.  Closed cell foam brushes can, in fact, provide a gentle polishing effect that will shine the vehicle's surface during a wash.\n\n[[File:Super Clean Auto Wash.JPG|thumb|A glass car wash building containing an inbay automatic and freestanding blowers]]\n\nAfter the main friction zone, some car washes have a dedicated care zone. Prior to entering the care zone, the car is rinsed with fresh water. This is immediately followed by a series of extra services. In many car washes, the first of these services is a polish wax. Polish waxes fill in microscopic imperfections in the vehicle's clear coat, thus improving shine. After the polish wax application is typically a retractable mitter or top brush and, in some cases, side brushes or wrap-around brushes. Next is a protectant, which creates a thin protective film over a vehicle's surface. Protectants generally repel water, which assists in drying the car and aiding in the driver's ability to see through their windshield during rain. A low-end wax or clear coat protectant follows the main protectant. A drying agent is typically applied at the end of the tunnel to assist in removing water from the vehicle's surface prior to forced air drying. After the drying agent, there may be a \"spot free\" rinse of soft water, that has been filtered of the salts normally present, and sent through semi-permeable membranes to produce highly purified water that will not leave spots.\n\nDrying is done using dryers, and, in many cases, mitters, side brushes, top brushes, and/or wraps outfitted with specialized drying material.<ref>{{Citation|title = Carwash Uden wasstraat|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKudzgBzoTg|date = 2 November 2015|accessdate = 16 January 2016}}</ref> Dryers may be present in a variety of forms, such as stationary gantries with a contouring roof jet or as small circular assemblies with nozzles of various shapes and sizes mounted on arches. Mitters, side brushes, top brushes, and/or wraps outfitted with [[chamois leather|chamois]]- or [[microfiber]]-based material may follow the dryers. In many cases, these additional drying components retract if a customer does not buy an upgrade. Below the dryers or textile drying elements are often tire shine applicators (also referred to as tire shiners). When active, a tire shiner extends out towards the vehicle and applies a water or silicone-based tire shine product to its brush, which in turn applies the product to the tire. Tire shiners are generally activated only if the customer purchases an upgrade.\n\nAt \"full-service\" car washes, the exterior of the car is washed mechanically with conveyorized equipment, by hand, or using a combination of both, with attendants available to dry the car manually, and to clean the interior (normally consisting of cleaning the windows, wiping the front and side dashes, and vacuuming the carpet and upholstery).  Many full service car washes also provide \"detailing\" services, which may include polishing and waxing the car's exterior by hand or machine, shampooing and steaming interiors, and other services to provide thorough cleaning and protection to the car.\n\n====Touchless wash====\n[[File:Touchless Car Wash.jpg|thumb|A touchless in-bay automatic car wash]]\n\nLike soft-touch car washes, touchless car washes are automated, with the vehicle passing through a tunnel where the vehicle is cleaned; however, touchless car washes do not use the foam or cloth applicators that soft-touch washes use, instead relying on high-pressure washers to both clean and rinse the vehicle off. Sensors utilized by these washes allow for a more precise clean along the vehicle's exact shape.<ref name=\"PC&D\">{{cite web |last1=Hobby |first1=Tom |title=Pros and cons: soft-touch vs. touch-free carwashing |url=https://www.carwash.com/pros-cons-soft-touch-vs-touch-free-carwashing/ |website=Professional Carwashing & Detailing |accessdate=October 15, 2019 |date=September 4, 2019}}</ref> To compensate for not physically contacting the vehicle, touchless washes use more caustic detergents than ordinary car washes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Johansen |first1=Mark |title=Will a Car Wash Hurt Your Car\u2019s Finish? |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/ownership/will-a-car-wash-hurt-your-cars-finish/ar-AADKWzY |website=[[MSN]] |accessdate=October 15, 2019 |date=July 2, 2019}}</ref> Because the vehicle is not physically impacted during a touchless wash, the vehicle is at a lower risk of being damaged.

Typically, women in bikinis bring in donors by standing on a roadside with colorful cardboard signs or posters, and the cars are washed by their classmates in a nearby parking lot.\nDepending on the organization responsible, as well as the local laws, a variation of the bikini car wash sometimes occurs, in which the women will wash the car topless, usually for an extra fee. There are also commercial bikini car washes, where bikini-clad women actually wash the cars for a fee and the entertainment of the drivers. [[Hooters]] restaurants usually have bikini car washes in the summer to attract customers.\n\n==Environmental factors==\nThe primary environmental considerations for car washing are:\n*Use of water and energy resources;\n*Contamination of surface waters;\n*[[Soil contamination|Contamination of soil]] and [[groundwater]].\n\nUse of water supplies and energy are self-evident, since car washes are users of such resources. The professional car wash industry has made great strides in reducing its environmental footprint, a trend that will continue to accelerate due to regulation and consumer demand. Many car washes already use water reclamation systems to significantly reduce water usage and a variety of energy usage reduction technologies.  These systems may be mandatory where [[water restrictions]] are in place. In Europe, Germany is leading the way and has very strict regulations making it illegal to wash your car on the street or in your driveway.\n\nContamination of surface waters may arise from the rinse discharging to storm drains, which eventually drain to [[river]]s and [[lake]]s. Chief pollutants in such wash-water include [[phosphate]]s; oil and grease; and lead. This is almost exclusively an issue for home/driveway washing, and parking lot style charity washes. Professional carwashing is a \"non-point source\" of discharge that has the ability to capture these contaminants, normally in [[Petrol interceptor|interceptor drains]], so the contaminants can be removed before the water enters sanitary systems.  (Water and contaminants that enter storm water drains does not undergo treatment, and is released directly into rivers, lakes and streams.)\n\nSoil contamination is sometimes related to such [[surface runoff]], but more importantly is associated with soil contamination from underground fuel tanks or auto servicing operations which commonly are ancillary uses of car wash sites&nbsp;\u2014 but not an issue for car washing itself.\n\nFor these reasons, some state and local environmental groups (the most notable being the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection) have begun campaigns to encourage consumers to use professional car washes as opposed to driveway washing, including moving charity car wash fund raisers from parking lots to professional car washes.\n\n{{wide image|Abandoned car wash in Houston, Texas.jpg|650px|alt=Abandoned car wash in Houston, Texas|align-cap=center|An abandoned self-serve car wash in Houston, Texas}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Auto detailing]]\n*[[Car costs]]\n*[[wikt:jetwash]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category|Car washes}}\n{{Commons category|Car washing}}\n{{wikibooks|Car Washing Techniques}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[http://www.carwash.org International Carwash Association]\n*[http://www.canadiancarwash.ca Canadian car Wash Association]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Car Wash}}\n[[Category:Motor vehicle maintenance|Wash]]\n[[Category:Car costs|Wash]]\n[[Category:Service retailing]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Facility used to clean the exterior of motor vehicles}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=August 2012}}\n{{original research|date=August 2012}}\n{{advert|date=July 2017}}\n}}\n[[File:2015 K\u0142odzko, ul.

Though, other commercial car washes came before it, the first semi-automatic car wash in the United States made its debut in 1946, and from there, the industry has grown in both size and sophistication.\n\n===1946===\nThe start of the history of car washing dated back into 1914. People used manpower to push or move the cars through stages of the process. Eventually, manual car wash operations peaked at 32 drive-through facilities in the United States. Prior to this time, the evolution of car washing was just at the beginning, and that the automatic car washing was born. The first semi-automatic car wash was active for the first time in [[Detroit]], Michigan using automatic pulley systems and manual brushing.<ref name=\"Car Wash Finder\">{{cite web | title=History of the Car Wash | website=Car Wash Finder | url=http://www.carwashfinder.com.au/resources/history-car-wash | accessdate=27 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1955===\nMany things had occurred within 1955 regarding car washing history. A businessman named Dan Hanna was encouraged by the car washers in Detroit, operated his own materials, then eventually made his own car wash called the Rub-a-Dub in [[Oregon]]. In 1957, he formed the Hanna Enterprises and eventually reached about 31 car washes in America. In 1959, Hanna operated his wash rack until he made the first mechanized car washing system. As the news spread throughout the city, so did his business.<ref name=\"Car Wash Finder\"/>\n\n===1960s===\nBy the mid 1960s Hanna Enterprises had established itself as the main source innovator and the manufacturer of car washing equipments and materials. Over time, Hanna had made several machines that will be the first to do the main requirements over car washing, this includes the Wrap-Around Brush, Roller-on-demand Conveyor belt, soft cloth friction washing, several ways to wash the [[tires]], and a recirculating water system. With that said, Hanna Enterprises have become the largest vehicle washing equipment manufacturer.<ref name=\"Car Wash Finder\"/>\n\n===1970s===\nIn the 1970s it was a difficult time for the car washing industry, as the result of the [[gasoline]] prices increasing rapidly. Still, Hanna Enterprises made another two inventions during this time: the automatic wheel cleaner, and the polish'n'wax.<ref name=\"Car Wash Finder\"/>\n\n\n==Categories==\n[[File:Broadways Car Wash.jpg|thumb|An in-bay automatic car wash performing a friction wash pass]]\nWhile there are many types of car washes, most fall into the following categories:\n*Car wash lift, where cars are placed in a car wash lift where cars can then be washed by employees. <ref name=\"Lam Tran\">{{cite web | url=http://www.sontunglam.com/tin-tuc/mo-tram-rua-xe-can-gi-kinh-nghiem-cho-nguoi-mo | title=M\u1ede TR\u1ea0M R\u1eecA XE C\u1ea6N G\u00cc ?

Generally these operators also have a generator to run a shop vac., buffers, and other tools as well.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n[[Machine|Mechanized]] car washes, especially those with brushes, were once avoided by some meticulous car owners because of the risk of damaging the finish. Paint finishes have improved as have car washing processes, and this perception of vehicle damage is much less prevalent today.  However, this perception was the motive behind the rise of facilities utilizing \"brushless\" (cloth) and \"touch-free\" (high-pressure water) equipment, as well as modern \"foam\" washing wheels made of closed cell foam.\n\nIn today's modern car wash facilities, whether tunnel, in-bay automatic or self-serve, soaps and other cleaning solutions used are designed to loosen and eliminate dirt and grime. This is in contrast to earlier times, when [[hydrofluoric acid]], a hazardous chemical, was commonly used as a cleaning agent in the industry by some operators.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}  There has been a strong move in the industry to shift to safer cleaning solutions. Most car wash facilities are required by law to treat and/or reuse their water and may be required to maintain waste-water discharge permits, in contrast to unregulated facilities or even driveway washing (at one's home), where waste-water can end up in the storm drain and, eventually, in streams, rivers, and lakes.\n\n==Self-serve car wash==\n[[File:Self-service car was in Seattle, Washington.jpg|thumb|right|A multi-bay, coin-operated self-service car wash in Seattle, Washington]]\nA simple and automated type of car wash that is typically coin-operated or [[Token (numismatics)|token]]-operated self-service system. Newer self-service car washes offer the ability to pay with [[credit card]]s or [[loyalty card]]s. The vehicle is parked inside a large covered bay that is equipped with a trigger gun and wand (a high-pressure sprayer) and a scrub foam-brush. When [[customer]]s insert coins or tokens into the [[Control system|controller]], they can choose options such as [[soap]], tire cleaner, wax or clear water rinse, all dispensed from the sprayer, or scrub the vehicle with the foam brush. The number of coins or tokens inserted determines the amount of time customers have to operate the equipment; in most instances, a minimum number of coins is necessary to start the equipment. These facilities are often equipped with separate [[vacuum cleaner|vacuum]] stations that allow customers to clean the [[upholstery]] and rugs inside their cars. Some self-service car washes offer hand-held dryers, a somewhat new feature.\n\n==Automatic car wash==\n[[File:Inside a car wash.jpg|thumb|Rotating brushes inside a conveyor car-wash]]\n\n===Conveyorized/tunnel car wash===\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=January 2018}}\nThe first conveyorized automatic car wash appeared in Hollywood, CA in 1940.Conveyorized automatic car washes consist of tunnel-like buildings into which customers (or attendants) drive.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nSome car washes have their customers pay through a computerized ''POS'', or [[point of sale]] unit, also known as an \"automatic cashier\", which may take the place of a human cashier.

On other systems the employee may guide the customer on and press a 'Send Car' button on the tunnel controller, to manually send the rollers which push the car through.\n\nPrior to entering the automated section of the wash tunnel, attendants may prewash customers' cars. This process can consist of a wide range of manual cleaning procedures, including applying specialized bug removing cleaning agents to various parts of the car, performing a manual high pressure prewash (possibly focusing on areas which the tunnel cannot sufficiently clean), and using manual brushes to scrub down areas of the vehicle which are difficult for the equipment to clean. Manual prewashing may be more extensive if a vehicle has mud or if the customer purchases an upgrade.\n\nWhen the customer is on the conveyor, the attendant (or signage) will instruct the customer to put the vehicle into neutral, release all [[brakes]], and refrain from steering. Failure to do so can cause an accident on the conveyor. The rollers come up behind the tires, pushing the car through a photogate, which measures vehicle length, allowing the controller to tailor the wash to each individual vehicle. Some car washes may also use ultrasonic profiling systems to determine the height or width of a vehicle, or to detect open pick-up truck beds. The equipment [[Structural system|frame]], or [[arch]]es, vary in number and type.\n[[File:Auto wash interior.jpg|thumb|A vehicle exiting the friction zone of the wash.

These arches often use nozzles positioned to spray chemicals in a bi-directional pattern.  In many cases, presoak arches are designed to foam the presoak prior to its application to the car. They may apply a higher pH (mild [[alkali]]) followed by a lower [[pH]] (mild [[acid]]) or vice versa. Chemical formulas and concentrations may also vary based upon seasonal dirt and film on vehicles, as well as exterior temperature, and other factors.  Chemical dilution and application works in combination with removal systems based on either high pressure water, friction, or a combination of both.  One or more sets CTAs, or \"chemical tire applicators,\" are often found near the presoak arches.  These will apply specialized formulations, which remove brake dust and build up from the surface of the wheels and tires.  In many cases, CTAs will only activate if the customer has purchased a wheel cleaning upgrade. Special presoaks may be applied if the customer purchases an upgrade. Extra presoaks are typically applied via a \"lava\" or \"sheet\"-style foamer to provide more of a show for the customer.<ref>{{Citation|title = Carwash Easy and Go lavaboog|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-buFWCvjPo|date = 17 December 2014|accessdate = 16 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the presoak application, a car wash tunnel's layout can vary greatly.  In some car washes, presoak application is followed by an empty space, or idle zone.  This provides time for the presoak to loosen dirt on the car.  In many cases, wheel cleaning equipment, such as sill brushes or high pressure wheel blasters, are placed in the idle zone.  A sill brush (also known as a wheel brush or tire brush) consists of an 8-foot-long brush assembly which is pushed against the car's wheels and door sill area. Sill brushes are typically use flagged bristle, as dirt is usually most heavily concentrated on the lower parts of the car. The material on a sill brush may have alternating lengths or use material which is intentionally mounted off-center to allow wheel surfaces of various depths to be cleaned. Sill brushes rely on the rotation of a customer's car's wheels in order to achieve complete wheel contact. Similarly to the CTAs, wheel brushes often only activate when the customer buys a wheel cleaning upgrade. Some car washes use wheel-rim disc brushes in addition to or in place of sill brushes. These assemblies extend out towards the wheel and follow it at the same speed as the conveyor while rotating at high speeds to clean the wheels. These devices are popular in car washes that use belt conveyors, as a belt conveyor prevents the wheels of a customer's car from rotating and thus renders sill brushes useless for wheel cleaning. Some car washes feature multiple sets of wheel brushes and offer multiple levels of wheel cleaning. Tracking high pressure wheel blasters consist of assemblies with multiple nozzles that follow a car's wheel over a distance. While following a car's wheel, a wheel blaster directs high-pressure water at the wheel. The following motion may be achieved by having the nozzles pivot to face the wheel or by having the nozzles move alongside the car at the same speed as the conveyor. At the end of a car wash's presoak idle zone is often a high pressure arch which direct high pressure water at a vehicle's surface. This may be done \"V-jet\" nozzles, rotating \"turbo\" nozzles, spinning manifolds, and oscillating and/or pivoting manifolds. Some high pressure systems maintain a constant distance from the vehicle to provide more consistent results. Separate high pressure top, wheel, and/or side blasters may be present in place of or supplementary to a high pressure arch.\n\n[[Image:orscarwash.jpg|thumb|A typical \"tunnel\" car wash viewed from the inside of a vehicle]]\n\nFollowing the idle zone and/or high pressure arch (if applicable) is the friction zone.  In the friction zone, a variety of brushes are used to clean all of the vehicle's surfaces.  Wrap-around brushes (wraps) clean the front, sides, and rear of a car.  A set of wraps consists of two offset brushes which are attached to overhead arms which are generally mounted over the center of the tunnel. Some wrap-around brush designs use jointed side-mounted arms to increase the brush's front and rear contact time. Wraps typically rotate with the vehicle's direction of travel. Some wrap-around brushes are capable of switching direction while cleaning the front of a car to prevent customers' license plates from being bent. Wraps are supplemented by side brushes. Side brushes rotate against the vehicle's direction of travel to increase cleaning power. Top brushes are rotating brush assemblies which clean the vehicle's top surfaces. A top brush can face either the entrance or exit of the tunnel to assist in cleaning the car's front or rear. Some specialized top brushes are designed to achieve more contact time with the front or rear of vehicles.<ref>{{Citation|title = ANAC Arnhem test 21-10-2012|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQTu9Z71zvI|date = 21 October 2012|accessdate = 16 January 2016}}</ref> To prevent damage, a top brush can be programmed to retract if an ultrasonic pick-up truck bed detection system detects a pick-up truck with an open bed. In many car washes, top brushes are either supplemented by or replaced with mitters. Mitters are ribbon-like components which suspend cloth strips or sheets over the tunnel while utilizing motion to increase friction against the car's surface. The friction zone may also include specialized front grill and rear brushes. Front grill brushes clean the front, and in many cases, the sides of vehicles. They often appear as side washers with an unusually long and bent arm. Instead of bent arms, some front grill brushes use jointed arms. Rear brushes appear as a specialized tall side washers with long arms that face the entrance of the tunnel. Once a car's mirror passes a rear brush, the brush makes contact with the vehicle's side, where it then continues to engage until the assembly cleans the rear of the car. Additional high pressure components may also be present in the main friction zone.<ref>{{Citation|title = Waschparadies Ulm by carwashTV|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9zWZ_-oxXY|date = 3 March 2011|accessdate = 16 January 2016}}</ref>  Older automatic washes - a majority of which were built prior to 1980 - used to use brushes with soft nylon bristles, which tended to leave a nylon deposit in the shape of a bristle, called brush marks, on the vehicle's paint. Many newer washes use either soft cloth (which is not harmful to a car's finish, as long as it is flushed with plenty of water to remove the grit from previous washes) or a closed cell foam brush, which does not hold dirt or water, thus is far less likely to harm any painted finish.  Closed cell foam brushes can, in fact, provide a gentle polishing effect that will shine the vehicle's surface during a wash.\n\n[[File:Super Clean Auto Wash.JPG|thumb|A glass car wash building containing an inbay automatic and freestanding blowers]]\n\nAfter the main friction zone, some car washes have a dedicated care zone. Prior to entering the care zone, the car is rinsed with fresh water. This is immediately followed by a series of extra services. In many car washes, the first of these services is a polish wax. Polish waxes fill in microscopic imperfections in the vehicle's clear coat, thus improving shine. After the polish wax application is typically a retractable mitter or top brush and, in some cases, side brushes or wrap-around brushes. Next is a protectant, which creates a thin protective film over a vehicle's surface. Protectants generally repel water, which assists in drying the car and aiding in the driver's ability to see through their windshield during rain. A low-end wax or clear coat protectant follows the main protectant. A drying agent is typically applied at the end of the tunnel to assist in removing water from the vehicle's surface prior to forced air drying. After the drying agent, there may be a \"spot free\" rinse of soft water, that has been filtered of the salts normally present, and sent through semi-permeable membranes to produce highly purified water that will not leave spots.\n\nDrying is done using dryers, and, in many cases, mitters, side brushes, top brushes, and/or wraps outfitted with specialized drying material.<ref>{{Citation|title = Carwash Uden wasstraat|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKudzgBzoTg|date = 2 November 2015|accessdate = 16 January 2016}}</ref> Dryers may be present in a variety of forms, such as stationary gantries with a contouring roof jet or as small circular assemblies with nozzles of various shapes and sizes mounted on arches. Mitters, side brushes, top brushes, and/or wraps outfitted with [[chamois leather|chamois]]- or [[microfiber]]-based material may follow the dryers. In many cases, these additional drying components retract if a customer does not buy an upgrade. Below the dryers or textile drying elements are often tire shine applicators (also referred to as tire shiners). When active, a tire shiner extends out towards the vehicle and applies a water or silicone-based tire shine product to its brush, which in turn applies the product to the tire. Tire shiners are generally activated only if the customer purchases an upgrade.\n\nAt \"full-service\" car washes, the exterior of the car is washed mechanically with conveyorized equipment, by hand, or using a combination of both, with attendants available to dry the car manually, and to clean the interior (normally consisting of cleaning the windows, wiping the front and side dashes, and vacuuming the carpet and upholstery).  Many full service car washes also provide \"detailing\" services, which may include polishing and waxing the car's exterior by hand or machine, shampooing and steaming interiors, and other services to provide thorough cleaning and protection to the car.\n\n====Touchless wash====\n[[File:Touchless Car Wash.jpg|thumb|A touchless in-bay automatic car wash]]\n\nLike soft-touch car washes, touchless car washes are automated, with the vehicle passing through a tunnel where the vehicle is cleaned; however, touchless car washes do not use the foam or cloth applicators that soft-touch washes use, instead relying on high-pressure washers to both clean and rinse the vehicle off. Sensors utilized by these washes allow for a more precise clean along the vehicle's exact shape.<ref name=\"PC&D\">{{cite web |last1=Hobby |first1=Tom |title=Pros and cons: soft-touch vs. touch-free carwashing |url=https://www.carwash.com/pros-cons-soft-touch-vs-touch-free-carwashing/ |website=Professional Carwashing & Detailing |accessdate=October 15, 2019 |date=September 4, 2019}}</ref> To compensate for not physically contacting the vehicle, touchless washes use more caustic detergents than ordinary car washes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Johansen |first1=Mark |title=Will a Car Wash Hurt Your Car\u2019s Finish? |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/ownership/will-a-car-wash-hurt-your-cars-finish/ar-AADKWzY |website=[[MSN]] |accessdate=October 15, 2019 |date=July 2, 2019}}</ref> Because the vehicle is not physically impacted during a touchless wash, the vehicle is at a lower risk of being damaged.

Typically, women in bikinis bring in donors by standing on a roadside with colorful cardboard signs or posters, and the cars are washed by their classmates in a nearby parking lot.\nDepending on the organization responsible, as well as the local laws, a variation of the bikini car wash sometimes occurs, in which the women will wash the car topless, usually for an extra fee. There are also commercial bikini car washes, where bikini-clad women actually wash the cars for a fee and the entertainment of the drivers. [[Hooters]] restaurants usually have bikini car washes in the summer to attract customers.\n\n==Environmental factors==\nThe primary environmental considerations for car washing are:\n*Use of water and energy resources;\n*Contamination of surface waters;\n*[[Soil contamination|Contamination of soil]] and [[groundwater]].\n\nUse of water supplies and energy are self-evident, since car washes are users of such resources. The professional car wash industry has made great strides in reducing its environmental footprint, a trend that will continue to accelerate due to regulation and consumer demand. Many car washes already use water reclamation systems to significantly reduce water usage and a variety of energy usage reduction technologies.  These systems may be mandatory where [[water restrictions]] are in place. In Europe, Germany is leading the way and has very strict regulations making it illegal to wash your car on the street or in your driveway.\n\nContamination of surface waters may arise from the rinse discharging to storm drains, which eventually drain to [[river]]s and [[lake]]s. Chief pollutants in such wash-water include [[phosphate]]s; oil and grease; and lead. This is almost exclusively an issue for home/driveway washing, and parking lot style charity washes. Professional carwashing is a \"non-point source\" of discharge that has the ability to capture these contaminants, normally in [[Petrol interceptor|interceptor drains]], so the contaminants can be removed before the water enters sanitary systems.  (Water and contaminants that enter storm water drains does not undergo treatment, and is released directly into rivers, lakes and streams.)\n\nSoil contamination is sometimes related to such [[surface runoff]], but more importantly is associated with soil contamination from underground fuel tanks or auto servicing operations which commonly are ancillary uses of car wash sites&nbsp;\u2014 but not an issue for car washing itself.\n\nFor these reasons, some state and local environmental groups (the most notable being the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection) have begun campaigns to encourage consumers to use professional car washes as opposed to driveway washing, including moving charity car wash fund raisers from parking lots to professional car washes.\n\n{{wide image|Abandoned car wash in Houston, Texas.jpg|650px|alt=Abandoned car wash in Houston, Texas|align-cap=center|An abandoned self-serve car wash in Houston, Texas}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Auto detailing]]\n*[[Car costs]]\n*[[wikt:jetwash]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category|Car washes}}\n{{Commons category|Car washing}}\n{{wikibooks|Car Washing Techniques}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[http://www.carwash.org International Carwash Association]\n*[http://www.canadiancarwash.ca Canadian car Wash Association]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Car Wash}}\n[[Category:Motor vehicle maintenance|Wash]]\n[[Category:Car costs|Wash]]\n[[Category:Service retailing]]\n", "name_user": "Beingonlineguru", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCategories:Hand car wash", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_wash"}

"{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}\nThe '''throw-away society''' is a human society strongly influenced by [[consumerism]]. The term describes a critical view of [[overconsumption]] and excessive production of short-lived or [[disposable]] items over durable goods that can be repaired.\n\n==Origin of the term==\nIn its August 1, 1955 issue [[Life magazine]] published an article titled ''\"Throwaway Living\"''.<ref>http://www.lifemagazineconnection.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1069</ref>\nThis article has been cited as the source that first used the term \"throw-away society\".<ref>http://photo.pds.org:5012/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2007121404</ref>\n\n==Rise of packaging waste==\n{{main|Packaging waste}}\nAs a consequence of [[economic growth]], we have seen both increased production and increased product waste during the last century. Between the start of New York City [[waste collection]]s in 1905 and 2005 there was a tenfold rise in \"product [[waste]]\" ([[packaging]] and old products), from 92 to 1,242 pounds (42 to 563 kilograms) per person per year. Containers and packaging now represent 32 percent of all [[municipal solid waste]]. [[Non-durable goods]] (defined as products in use for less than three years) constitute 27 percent, while durable goods comprise 16 percent.<ref>Products, Waste, And The End Of The Throwaway Society, Helen Spiegelman and Bill Sheehan, The Networker, http://www.sehn.org/Volume_10-2.html</ref>\n\n==Food service and disposable food packaging==\n{{see|Disposable food packaging}} \n[[Disposable tableware]] was a key part of the business strategy of chain [[Fast food|fast food]] restaurants in the US.<ref name=\"feedbins\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JhTU1lVp8 McDonald's ad \"Feed the Wastebaskets\"] (video), training children to bus disposable packaging [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tRmNqpdG6M (alternate link)]</ref> In order for the business model to work, fast food chains found it economically advantageous to convince consumers through advertising campaigns to carry their own tableware to a waste bins, in order to avoid labor expenses incurred in clearing tables.<ref name=\"dontbus\">[http://www.skoozeme.com/issues/dontbus.html http://skoozeme.com/issues/dontbus.html]</ref>  By establishing a custom in which customers are encouraged to carry disposables, some of the internal costs of the disposable tableware can be offset.\n\nIn 2002, [[Taiwan]] began taking action to reduce the use of [[disposable tableware]] at institutions and businesses, and to reduce the use of [[plastic bag]]s. Yearly, the nation of 17.7 million people was producing {{convert|59000|t}} of disposable tableware waste and {{convert|105000|t}} of waste plastic bags, and increasing measures have been taken in the years since then to reduce the amount of waste.<ref>Env. Research Foundation (undated). [http://www.rachel.org/?q=en/node/149 Taiwan\u2019s Plastics Ban].</ref> In 2013, Taiwan's Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) banned outright the use of disposable tableware in the nation's 968 schools, government agencies and hospitals.  The ban is expected to eliminate {{convert|2600|t}} of waste like [[disposable cup]]s yearly.<ref>China Post. June 5, 2013. [http://www.chinapost.com.tw/print/111477.htm EPA to ban disposable cups from June 1].</ref>\n\nIn [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]], laws banning use of disposable food and drink containers at large-scale events have been enacted. Such a ban has been in place in Munich, Germany since 1991, applying to all city facilities and events. This includes events of all sizes, including very large ones ([[Christmas market]], Auer-Dult Faire, [[Oktoberfest]] and Munich City Marathon). For small events of a few hundred people, the city has arranged for a corporation offer rental of crockery and dishwasher equipment. In part through this regulation, Munich reduced the waste generated by Oktoberfest, which attracts tens of thousands of people, from 11,000 metric tons in 1990 to 550 tons in 1999.<ref>Pre-Waste EU.

About 45 percent are made from trees &ndash; about 3.8 million of them &ndash; mainly [[Populus|cotton wood]], [[birch]], and [[spruce]], the remainder being made from [[bamboo]]. Japan uses about 24 billion pairs of these disposables per year, and globally about 80 billion pairs are thrown away by about 1.4 million people. Reusable chopsticks in restaurants have a lifespan of 130 meals. In Japan, with disposable ones costing about 2 cents and reusable ones costing typically $1.17, the reusables better the $2.60 breakeven cost. Campaigns in several countries to reduce this waste are beginning to have some effect.<ref>New York Times. Reus Oct. 24, 2011.

Most notable are the large shipments of trash from North America and Western Europe to Africa and Asia due to the relatively low cost of disposal. By the 1990s, over half of all nations in Africa have faced negative externalities from [[toxic waste]] dumped by richer countries. Waste, both toxic and non-toxic is often dumped without [[safety regulations]]. It is thrown in unlined and unregulated [[landfill]]s where it [[soil contamination|contaminates soil]] and water, and even [[waste incineration|burnt]], which circulates toxins in the air. Recently, [[electronic waste]] shipped to [[Nigeria]] has increased due to higher consumption of electronics by North America Europe, with hundreds of shipments of old electronics dropped off at [[Lagos]], Nigeria, every month. A significantly large percentage of the trash being hazardous waste shipped with the \"explicit intent of cheap (and unsafe) disposal\". China, also, receives huge amounts of waste, often toxic material, averaging 1.9 million tons per year, because companies find it cheaper to ship garbage away rather than dispose of it themselves. \n<ref>{{cite book|last1=Liddick|first1=Donald|title=Crimes Against Nature|date=2011|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=978-0-313-38464-6|pages=14\u201316}}</ref>\n\n==Food waste==\n{{main article|food waste}}\nIn 2004, a [[University of Arizona]] study indicates that forty to fifty percent of all edible food never gets eaten.

They are the \u03b17&nbsp;II (ILCE-7M2), \u03b17R&nbsp;II (ILCE-7RM2) and \u03b17S&nbsp;II (ILCE-7SM2).\n[[Sony]] continues to produce the first generation models \u03b17 and \u03b17S, even three years after the launch, only the \u03b17R has been discontinued in April 2019.\n\nThe basic \u03b17 II model has 24&nbsp;MP and hybrid autofocus.\n\nThe second generation common ground is the newer and improved body design as well as the world's first five-axis sensor-shift image stabilization system for a full-frame ILC. Sony claims that this can compensate a 4.5-stop equivalent of camera shake. In-body stabilization requires no special lens features, and mirrorless system cameras can typically accommodate lenses from any SLR system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/sony-a7-ii/sony-a7-iiA.HTM |title=Sony \u03b17&nbsp;II Review |author=William Browley |accessdate=2015-01-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stevehuffphoto.com/2014/11/26/the-new-sony-a7-mark-ii-pricing-and-ship-dates/ |title=The New Sony \u03b17 Mark II |accessdate=2015-01-14}}</ref> As an upgrade of the \u03b17, the \u03b17&nbsp;II has the same 50&nbsp;Mbit XAVC-S codec as the \u03b17S but lacks 4K video, and the five-axis stabilization is less effective in video mode than that used in the [[Olympus OM-D E-M1]].<ref name=\"reid\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eoshd.com/2014/11/sony-a7-ii-review-5-axis-stabilisation-video-mode/ | title=Sony \u03b17&nbsp;II review \u2013 5 axis stabilization in video mode | author=Andrew Reid | accessdate=2015-01-14}}</ref> However, the crop mode used in the \u03b17&nbsp;II does not incur \"very much loss in image quality\", unlike that of the [[Nikon D750]].<ref name=\"reid\" />\n\nOn 14 June 2015, [[Hasselblad]] announced the '''Lusso''', a variant of the Sony \u03b17R marketed by Hasselblad.\n\nThe third generation started in 2017, and the fourth was announced in July 2019.\n\n=={{anchor|ILCE-7|ILCE-7R|ILCE-7S|ILCE-7II}}Model differences==\n{{See also|Sony \u03b17 II|Sony \u03b17R II|Sony \u03b17S II|Sony \u03b17R III|Sony \u03b17 III|Sony \u03b17R IV}}\n{|class=wikitable style=line-height:1;text-align:center\n|-\n!Model!!\u03b17!!\u03b17R!!\u03b17S!!\u03b17 II!!\u03b17R II!!\u03b17S II!!\u03b17R III!! \u03b17 III!! \u03b17R IV\n|-\n!Product standing\n|Balanced||High Resolution||High Sensitivity||Balanced Mark II||High Resolution Mark II||High Sensitivity Mark II||High Resolution Mark III||Balanced Mark III || High Resolution Mark IV\n|-\n!Sensor resolution at [[35mm format|Full Format]]\n|24.3 Mpx [[Exmor]] CMOS<br>6000\u00d74000 pixels||36.4 Mpx Exmor CMOS<br>7360\u00d74912 pixels|| bgcolor=\"FFCC99\" |12.2 Mpx Exmor CMOS<br>4240\u00d72832 pixels||24.3 Mpx Exmor CMOS<br>6,000\u00d74,000 pixels||bgcolor=B0FFB0|42.4 Mpx [[Exmor R]] BSI-CMOS<ref name=\"IMX378-XDA\" /><br>7952\u00d75,304 pixels|| bgcolor=\"FFCC99\" |12.2 Mpx Exmor CMOS<br>4,240\u00d72,832 pixels||bgcolor=B0FFB0|42.4 Mpx [[Exmor R]] BSI-CMOS<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7rm3#product_details_default|title=Sony \u03b17R III 35mm full-frame camera with autofocus|author=|date=|website=Sony}}</ref><br>7952\u00d75304 pixels|| bgcolor=\"B0FFB0\" |24.2MP Mpx [[Exmor R]] BSI-CMOS sensor<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7m3-body-kit#product_details_default|title=Sony \u03b17 III with 35-mm full-frame image sensor|author=|date=|website=Sony}}</ref><br>6000 x 4000 pixels || bgcolor=B0FFB0 | 61.0 MP Mpx [[Exmor R]] BSI-CMOS sensor<ref name=A7RIV>{{cite web|url=https://www.dpreview.com/news/7747501993/sony-introduces-a7r-iv |title= Sony introduces the a7R IV with 61 Megapixel full-frame sensor |website=Digital Photography Review |date=July 16, 2019 |accessdate=July 16, 2019}}</ref><br>9504 x 6336 pixels\n|-\n![[ISO speed|ISO range]]\n|bgcolor=FFCC99|Expanded ISO 50 -

Sony claims that this can compensate a 4.5-stop equivalent of camera shake.
