The wing's dark carpal patches can also display broad panels of [[Buff (colour)|buff]] or almost [[orange (colour)|orange]] on the wings across the base of primaries, which represent a more richly emphasized version of a pattern shared with other owls that tend to be [[vole]]-hunting specialists, like [[short-eared owl]]s (''Asio flammeus'') and [[great gray owl]] (''Strix nebulosa''). On the underside, the body tends to be a somewhat paler ochraceous-tawny compared to the upperside.

However, some potential owl species may be confused for them. [[Stygian owl]]s (''Asio stygius'') (which barely overlap perhaps in northern Mexico) is larger with partially bare toes and generally darker with [[ink]]y and more boldly patterned plumage, with often nearly the enter facial mask appearing off-black.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Howell>Howell, S. N., & Webb, S. (1995). ''A guide to the birds of Mexico and northern Central America''. Oxford University Press.</ref> [[Tawny owl]]s, which co-exist with long-eared owls in Eurasia, are unlikely to be mistaken given that they usually appear considerably rounder and bulkier overall (and are indeed slightly larger and much heavier), further possessing a much broader, more rounded head. The tawny species has no ear tufts, eyes of blackish-brown colour and relatively shorter wings. In flight, tawny owls show well-fingered primaries (with five apparent emarginations) unlike the squared off wings of the long-eared owl.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Mikkola2/><ref name= Davis>Davis, A. H., & Prytherch, R. (1976). ''Field identification of Long-eared and Short-eared Owls''. British Birds, 69, 281-287.</ref> The [[Eurasian eagle-owl]] (''Bubo bubo'') is far larger and more massive than a long-eared owl with visibly more overdeveloped and  powerful-looking feet and talons and a huge squared-off-looking head with the ear tufts set nearer to the edge. The eagle-owl is often more heavily patterned on the crown and back with heavy blackish marking but has a less strongly demarked (and shallower) facial disc when compared to the long-eared.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Mikkola2/> In some parts of the wintering range, other [[Horned owl|eagle-owls]] may scarcely abut the wide range of long-eared owls in Eurasia (and perhaps [[Northwestern Africa]]) but are usually distinguishable (similarly as in the Eurasian species) by size differences, plumage characteristics and, occasionally, habitat preferences.<ref name= Weick/> Asian [[Horned owl|fish owls]], which are essentially a subset of eagle-owls, are generally also much larger than long-eared owls with tousled looking ear tufts, have less variable coloring and often have feathering over only part of their tarsi.<ref name= Konig/> In North America, [[great horned owl]]s (''Bubo virginianus''), yet another type of eagle-owl in all but name, have a squarish head and more widely separated ear tufts. Like other ''Bubo'' species, great horned owls are also perceptibly larger and more massively built than any long-eared owl (despite being smaller than the Eurasian eagle-owl). Great horned owls also have typically heavily barred, rather than streaked, underparts.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Johnsgard/> [[Scops owl|Scops]] and [[screech owl]]s are much smaller than long-eared owls, as well as differently marked (often with more individual varying overall coloring, i.e. from gray to brown to [[rufous]]) and usually have rather short ear tufts.<ref name= Konig/> [[Marsh owl]] (''Asio capensis'') (rare overlap perhaps in northern [[Morocco]]) is generally brown with quite different looking fine mottling or barring below and has brown eyes and tiny ear tufts.<ref name= Konig/>\n\nOver much of its range, long-eared owls occur with the related [[short-eared owl]], the latter species averaging slightly larger. Much has been written about distinguishing them in the field, though, if seen well, the resemblance between the species is not particularly strong. Furthermore, the two species differ in habitat preferences, with the short-eared owl often favoring (where available) any kind of entirely treeless, open habitats (including many [[wetland]]s and [[Tundra|Artic tundra]] as well as [[steppe]], [[prairie]] and extensive [[meadow]]s), often avoiding the edge habitats favored by the long-eared.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Konig/><ref name= Davis/> However, in dim light, at a distance or in flight, confusion is certainly possible.<ref name= Davis/><ref name= Robertson>Robertson, Iain S. (1982). ''Field identification of Long-eared and Short-eared Owls''. British Birds 75(5):227-229.</ref> In both long-eared and short-eared owls, the flight style when seen has a distinctive, erratic and [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] flapping quality that many [[birdwatcher]]s considered reminiscent of a [[moth]].<ref name= Sutton>{{cite book |title=''Birds and Birding at Cape May: What to See and When and Where to Go'' |first1=Pat |last1=Sutton |first2=Clay |last2=Sutton |publisher=Stackpole Books |year=2006 |isbn=978-0811731348}}</ref> At rest, the ear-tufts of the long-eared owl serve to easily distinguish the two (although long-eared owls can sometimes hold their ear-tufts lax). The iris-colour differs: yellow in short-eared, and often orange in long-eared. Furthermore, the black surrounding the eyes is vertical and slight on the long-eared, and horizontal and far more conspicuous on the short-eared. Overall, the short-eared owl tends to be a paler, sandier-looking bird than the long-eared, lacking the darker and more extensive markings of the latter.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Davis/><ref name= Robertson/>  There are a number of other ways in which the two species differ which are best seen when they are flying. Short-eared owls often have a broad white band along the rear edge of the wing, which is not shown by long-eared owls. On the upperwing, the short-eared owl's primary-patches are usually paler and more obvious. The band on the upper side of the short-eared owl's tail are usually bolder than those of the long-eared. The short-eared's innermost secondaries are often dark-marked, contrasting with the rest of the underwing. The long-eared owl has streaking throughout its underparts whereas on the short-eared the streaking ends at the breast. The dark markings on the underside of the tips of the longest primaries are bolder on short-eared owls. The upperparts of short-eared owls are coarsely blotched, whereas on the long-eared they are more finely marked. The short-eared owl also differs structurally from the long-eared, having longer, slimmer wings. The shorter and broader wings in combination with a squarer tail in long-eared owls produce proportions more reminiscent of a [[Common buzzard|buzzard]] than the short-eared.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Johnsgard/><ref name= Hume/><ref name= Davis/><ref name= Robertson/><ref name= Harris>Harris, A., Tucker, L., & Vinicombe, K.

Their upperparts are ochraceous-tawny, finely peppered with dusky spots and blackish streaks on a grey \"veil\", while the crown is finely [[mottle]]d in dusky. The nape and hindneck bear dusky shaft-streaks with the feather outer webs of the scapulars being whitish, forming a row across the shoulder. [[Flight feather|Primaries]] basally are uniformly ochraceous-tawny, distally barred light and dark, while the [[Flight feather|secondaries]] are barred ochraeous and dusky. The tail is typically tawny with a greyish wash, overlaid with 6-8 very narrow dark brown bars. The underparts have a base colour of ochre, with the foreneck and upper breast marked with blackish-brown streaks, thence becomes paler below and marked with dusky shaft-streaks and narrow cross bars. The underwing has distinctive barring and dark comma-like markings at the wrist (conspicuously lacking on overlapping Eurasian [[short-eared owl]]s). The eyes tend to be yellowish [[orange (colour)|orange]] to orange, but occasionally may be [[chrome yellow]]. The [[cere]] is brownish-[[flesh]], the bill is grey and the talons are blackish grey.

Long-eared owls, unlike these irruptive northern owls, often migrate from the northern areas regardless of conditions. However, like the northern irruptive owls, long-eared owls tend to appear in unprecedented numbers to the south when a peak prey year is followed by a winter during which prey population crashes. In North America, the migratory habits of long-eared owls are strongly mirrored by those of [[northern saw-whet owl]]s.<ref name= Kirk/><ref name= Cheveau>Cheveau, M., Drapeau, P., Imbeau, L., & Bergeron, Y.

In winter often stays close to the same tree or grove of trees (i.e. in [[park]]s, large gardens, or cemeteries). Usual when approached, the owl will freezes with its body stiffly upright, eyes closed to narrow slits and ear tufts erect. This is called the \u201ctall-thin position\u201d and is common to at least a couple dozen species of typical owl. If approached closed, the owls will alternately open and close their eyes (apparently having stirred but trying to fool potential predators into thinking the owl is still at rest), finally lowering ear tufts, fluffing body plumage and flying to another roost.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Mikkola2/> Unlike most owls, which show a tendency towards territorial behavior on a fixed range year-around when possible, long-eared owls in the non-breeding season are often prone to occur in [[Aggregation (ethology)|aggregations]] of owls while roosting. Such grouping may not uncommonly include up to 6 to 50 owls at times, with a European record of about 150 owls at a single roost.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Hume/><ref name= Mikkola2/><ref name= Bent/> Even other migratory owls in the temperate zone do not tolerate each other as closely as do long-eared owls, with short-eared owls seemingly only forming aggregations when food supplies are exceptionally high, while social roosting in long-eared owls seems to occur regardless of local prey numbers.<ref name= Mikkola2/><ref name= Schneider>Schneider, K.

Roost height in the New Jersey study was at {{convert|3|to|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} or occasionally higher. In New Jersey, different roosts were preferred each year and in the local heavily modified environment, the owls become partially habituated to human activities. However, approach at closer than {{convert|3|to|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} away usually caused them to flush. Departure of owls for nighttime hunting would generally occur between 40 and 49 minutes after sundown.<ref name=Bosakowski/> Studies in the [[Moscow]] region of wintering roosts were done over 10 years, with 12 communal and 14 solitary roosts found. The communal roosts included up to 16 individuals per winter, with a mean of 9.9. Overall, the average in Moscow per roost site was 2.1 owl(s).

In lab settings, long-eared owls were considerably more skilled at finding mice by sound in more or less complete darkness than [[Tawny owl|tawny]] and [[barred owl]]s (''Strix varia''), and in some American experiments even outclassed the auditorily-acute [[barn owl]]s in this regard.<ref name= Marti>Marti, C.

Long-eared owls either disregarded or killed but did not eat [[amphibian]]s, while tawny owls did catch and eat amphibians when they were available. Occasionally the tawny owls would attack fish whilst one long-eared owl caught but did not eat a fish. The European study further revealed that several owls of different species ate bits of plant and did not appear to do so out of food deprivation or hunger.<ref name= Raber>R\u00e4ber, H. (1949).

One study accrued information from 312 studies from around the species\u2019 range. In total 478 prey species were found to be described, of which 180 were [[mammal]] species, 191 were [[bird]] species, 83 were assorted [[invertebrate]] species, 15 were [[reptile]]s, 7 were [[amphibian]]s, and reportedly just a couple [[fish]] species.

Ardea, 97(4), 615-625.</ref> However, on closer inspection, the long-eared owl generally appears to be something of a dietary specialist. It usually takes primarily, often nearly entirely, small [[mammal]]s, e.g. [[rodent]]s, as food in almost every part of its range. Usually a broad picture emerges that between 80 and 99% of the diet consists of mammals, averaging 94% in one estimate for all of Europe. However, in [[Subtropics|warmer]], [[Island|insular]] or more [[Peri-urbanisation|urbanized]] environments, a greater percentage or, rarely, even a majority of the diet can locally be non-mammalian prey.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Konig/><ref name= Birrer/><ref name= Marti2>Marti, C.

In accordance with the cyclic nature of vole populations, the local numbers of long-eared owls can rise and fall sharply. In low vole years, they tend to lay fewer eggs and feed fewer young, and may not attempt to breed at all. In high vole years, they generally lay and hatch more eggs and rear more young. While incubation starts with first egg, only the oldest siblings may be feed in low food years.

A wide variety of owls are especially likely to be encountered both in terms of shared [[nocturnality]] and a shared preference for rodent prey, which is favored by about 75% of owls found in North America and about 85% of the owls found in Europe and occasionally favored by nearly all owls in both continents.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Johnsgard/><ref name= Mikkola2/> Much study has gone into contrasting the ecology of long-eared owls against other owls and also occasionally diurnal birds of prey, especially in terms of differences in dietary habits and habitat preferences. In Europe, arguably the most populous owl is likely the [[tawny owl]], which has therefore warranted a considerable number of comparisons with long-eared owls. While tawny owls overlap in prey preferences with the long-eared owl, it tends to show greater dietary flexibility, with larger contributions of secondary prey such as birds, reptiles and amphibians and insects. For example, in southern Sweden, the [[Niche differentiation|food niche breadth]] of tawny owls was roughly three times greater than that of long-eared owls. Generally tawny owls prefer more extensively [[Woodland|wooded environments]] than long-eared owls but can adapt as well as the long-eared to [[forest fragmentation]] and [[peri-urbanisation]], thus often competing rather directly over foods. While the tawny owl usually selects slightly larger prey on average than long-eared owls, often over {{convert|30|g|oz|abbr=on}} mean prey mass, studied size of common voles hunted in central Lithuania showed that both long-eared and tawny owls selected larger than average voles, with average caught estimated at {{convert|21.45|g|oz|abbr=on}} against the average weight surveyed by humans at {{convert|16.42|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Surprisingly, especially in the non-breeding season in this study, long-eared owls in Lithuania tended to select larger voles on average (at {{convert|21.56|g|oz|abbr=on}}) than did tawny owls ({{convert|19.56|g|oz|abbr=on}}).<ref name= Raber/><ref name= Balciauskas>Balciauskas, L., & Balciauskiene, L.

However, the long-eared owl takes larger prey on average usually than little owls, since it focuses more on rodents rather than invertebrates like [[insect]]s and [[earthworm]]s and, especially during winter, varies its prey compositions less so than the smaller species. Also, the long-eared owl requires some timbered spots for roosting purposes while little owls can adapt to both treeless and partially treed areas as well as, in [[Spain]] at least, more heavily modified areas by humans.<ref name= Martinez/><ref name= Scott/><ref name= Sekour/><ref name= Romanowski>Romanowski, J.

Despite considerable overlap in both range and diet, long-eared owls are largely buffered from considerable competition with short-eared owls by habitat preferences, as the short-eared owls always venture to more open habitats, generally roosting and nesting in [[Grass|tall grasses]] rather than timber, and seldom, if ever, hunt in the same edge habitats as the long-eared species.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Mikkola2/><ref name= Selcuk/> In western [[Russia]] when compared to short-eared owl, long-eared owl showed less of a tendency to appear in cluster where prey was concentrated, most likely because of the habitat differences.

The habitats used by the barn and long-eared owls are not mutually exclusive nor are their prey species. Despite being similar aerial hunters of open areas, barn owls differ in life history in many respects from long-eared owls, in part by being cavity nesters. While their dietary habits can appear similar and show similar dependence on small mammals, barn owls are somewhat more generalized and catholic as feeders, with less of a heavy reliance on voles. Barn owls can live quite well on virtually any small mammal assemblage. In some parts of Europe, the two species\u2019 food niche breadth is comparable or even slightly higher in the long-eared. However, globally barn owls are much more wide-ranging, more tropical in their central range and globally have a much wider prey spectrum than long-eared owls. Barn owls are also more widely adaptive to [[Island|insular]] living than long-eared owls, and are capable living proficiently on a diversity of prey classes even in environments completely lacking small mammals.<ref name= Yalden/><ref name= Alivizatos/><ref name= Sekour/><ref name= Leader2/><ref name= Roulin/><ref name= Capizzi>Capizzi, D., & Luigi Canou, P.

Consequently, in the Americas, barn owls tend to consistently take slightly larger prey than long-eared owls and tend to access a broader overall [[Ecological niche|feeding niche]].<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Marti/><ref name= Barrows/><ref name= Marks2/> Despite the great adaptability and range of the barn owl, it was found in a study from [[France]] that they experience higher mortality due to starvation than long-eared and tawny owls. This was attributed to the barn owl's inferior [[Fatty acid metabolism|lipid fat reserves]] while they attempt to survive the cooler seasons within [[temperate climate]]s, as they are better suited to survival in warmer climates.<ref name= Massemin>Massemin, S., & Handrich, Y.

However, again, in most cases habitat preferences, slight partitioning in dietary preferences (which may be in prey species or body sizes of prey selected) and life histories generally allow most species to persist even when living in proximity to one another.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Johnsgard/> As throughout their range, long-eared owls tend to differ from most other North American owls by being much more migratory in nature. Therefore, [[Population cycle|cyclic food variations]] affect them differently and are less likely to be the direct cause of winter mortality than in more permanently residential owls.<ref name= BNA/><ref name= Cheveau/><ref name= Krebs>Krebs, C.

In this regard, long-eared owls are much more often the victims rather than the predators. Their generally successful life history on the contrary often makes long-eared owls perhaps more vulnerable than most other medium-sized owls to predations and even perhaps many smaller owl species. These include nesting in relatively open abandoned bird nests rather than hard to access cavities. Also, long-eared owls tendency to occur in quite open areas whilst hunting coupled with the loud vocalizations (including begging calls of their fledglings) and other auditory displays are all likely to court predators.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Mikkola2/><ref name= Earhart/><ref name= Mikkola3>Mikkola, H.

It is likely that largely perch hunting raptor such as ''[[Buteo]]'' and most [[eagle]]s may either chance upon an owl roost during a hunting foray or encounter a long-eared owl perhaps during overlapping activity around dawn or dusk, while large [[falcon]]s are likely to only strike one down when an owl is flushed during daytime.

However, some potential owl species may be confused for them. [[Stygian owl]]s (''Asio stygius'') (which barely overlap perhaps in northern Mexico) is larger with partially bare toes and generally darker with [[ink]]y and more boldly patterned plumage, with often nearly the enter facial mask appearing off-black.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Howell>Howell, S. N., & Webb, S. (1995). ''A guide to the birds of Mexico and northern Central America''. Oxford University Press.</ref> [[Tawny owl]]s, which co-exist with long-eared owls in Eurasia, are unlikely to be mistaken given that they usually appear considerably rounder and bulkier overall (and are indeed slightly larger and much heavier), further possessing a much broader, more rounded head. The tawny species has no ear tufts, eyes of blackish-brown colour and relatively shorter wings. In flight, tawny owls show well-fingered primaries (with five apparent emarginations) unlike the squared off wings of the long-eared owl.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Mikkola2/><ref name= Davis>Davis, A. H., & Prytherch, R. (1976). ''Field identification of Long-eared and Short-eared Owls''. British Birds, 69, 281-287.</ref> The [[Eurasian eagle-owl]] (''Bubo bubo'') is far larger and more massive than a long-eared owl with visibly more overdeveloped and  powerful-looking feet and talons and a huge squared-off-looking head with the ear tufts set nearer to the edge. The eagle-owl is often more heavily patterned on the crown and back with heavy blackish marking but has a less strongly demarked (and shallower) facial disc when compared to the long-eared.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Mikkola2/> In some parts of the wintering range, other [[Horned owl|eagle-owls]] may scarcely abut the wide range of long-eared owls in Eurasia (and perhaps [[Northwestern Africa]]) but are usually distinguishable (similarly as in the Eurasian species) by size differences, plumage characteristics and, occasionally, habitat preferences.<ref name= Weick/> Asian [[Horned owl|fish owls]], which are essentially a subset of eagle-owls, are generally also much larger than long-eared owls with tousled looking ear tufts, have less variable coloring and often have feathering over only part of their tarsi.<ref name= Konig/> In North America, [[great horned owl]]s (''Bubo virginianus''), yet another type of eagle-owl in all but name, have a squarish head and more widely separated ear tufts. Like other ''Bubo'' species, great horned owls are also perceptibly larger and more massively built than any long-eared owl (despite being smaller than the Eurasian eagle-owl). Great horned owls also have typically heavily barred, rather than streaked, underparts.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Johnsgard/> [[Scops owl|Scops]] and [[screech owl]]s are much smaller than long-eared owls, as well as differently marked (often with more individual varying overall coloring, i.e. from gray to brown to [[rufous]]) and usually have rather short ear tufts.<ref name= Konig/> [[Marsh owl]] (''Asio capensis'') (rare overlap perhaps in northern [[Morocco]]) is generally brown with quite different looking fine mottling or barring below and has brown eyes and tiny ear tufts.<ref name= Konig/>\n\nOver much of its range, long-eared owls occur with the related [[short-eared owl]], the latter species averaging slightly larger. Much has been written about distinguishing them in the field, though, if seen well, the resemblance between the species is not particularly strong. Furthermore, the two species differ in habitat preferences, with the short-eared owl often favoring (where available) any kind of entirely treeless, open habitats (including many [[wetland]]s and [[Tundra|Artic tundra]] as well as [[steppe]], [[prairie]] and extensive [[meadow]]s), often avoiding the edge habitats favored by the long-eared.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Konig/><ref name= Davis/> However, in dim light, at a distance or in flight, confusion is certainly possible.<ref name= Davis/><ref name= Robertson>Robertson, Iain S. (1982). ''Field identification of Long-eared and Short-eared Owls''. British Birds 75(5):227-229.</ref> In both long-eared and short-eared owls, the flight style when seen has an distinctive, erratic and [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] flapping quality that many [[birdwatcher]]s considered reminiscent of a [[moth]].<ref name= Sutton>{{cite book |title=''Birds and Birding at Cape May: What to See and When and Where to Go'' |first1=Pat |last1=Sutton |first2=Clay |last2=Sutton |publisher=Stackpole Books |year=2006 |isbn=978-0811731348}}</ref> At rest, the ear-tufts of the long-eared owl serve to easily distinguish the two (although long-eared owls can sometimes hold their ear-tufts lax). The iris-colour differs: yellow in short-eared, and often orange in long-eared. Furthermore, the black surrounding the eyes is vertical and slight on the long-eared, and horizontal and far more conspicuous on the short-eared. Overall, the short-eared owl tends to be a paler, sandier-looking bird than the long-eared, lacking the darker and more extensive markings of the latter.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Davis/><ref name= Robertson/>  There are a number of other ways in which the two species differ which are best seen when they are flying. Short-eared owls often have a broad white band along the rear edge of the wing, which is not shown by long-eared owls. On the upperwing, the short-eared owl's primary-patches are usually paler and more obvious. The band on the upper side of the short-eared owl's tail are usually bolder than those of the long-eared. The short-eared's innermost secondaries are often dark-marked, contrasting with the rest of the underwing. The long-eared owl has streaking throughout its underparts whereas on the short-eared the streaking ends at the breast. The dark markings on the underside of the tips of the longest primaries are bolder on short-eared owls. The upperparts of short-eared owls are coarsely blotched, whereas on the long-eared they are more finely marked. The short-eared owl also differs structurally from the long-eared, having longer, slimmer wings. The shorter and broader wings in combination with a squarer tail in long-eared owls produce proportions more reminiscent of a [[Common buzzard|buzzard]] than the short-eared.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Johnsgard/><ref name= Hume/><ref name= Davis/><ref name= Robertson/><ref name= Harris>Harris, A., Tucker, L., & Vinicombe, K.

It is well known that a majority of owls can hunt in darkness due to their extraordinary hearing, which allows them to pinpoint locations of prey, but they can also utilize their hearing to track intraspecific calls and activities and avoid predation risks.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Schwartzkopff2/><ref name= vanDijk/>\n[[File:Partial Eclipsed Moon and Long-eared Owl calls.webm|thumb|left|Partial Eclipsed Moon and the begging calls of Long-eared Owls after they've left the nest.]]\nThe vocalizations of this species are highly variable.

''Nesting and food habits of the Long-eared Owl in Michigan (Vol. 1)''.

It starts with some hoots at slightly lower pitch before reaching full [[Loudness|volume]] and quality. On calm nights, this song may carry over up to {{convert|1|to|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away (at least to human auditory perception). The song of the male is around 400 [[hertz]].<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Johnsgard/> In [[North America]], some observers have considered the male's song as [[Analogy|analogous]] to the deep cooing of [[band-tailed pigeon]]s (''Patagioenas fasciata'').<ref name= Voous/> Females gives a weaker, less clear and much higher pitched song with a nasal quality. In nearly all owl species, the females, despite being typically the larger sex, have smaller [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinx]] than the males and so tend to have less powerful voices.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Konig/><ref name= Schwartzkopff/> The call of the female is at times compared to a weak [[tin whistle]] and is only audible at close range, being about 4-5 [[halftone]]s higher than the song of the male.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Konig/> Females usually call only in duet with male during courtship, but also when the nest is selected and around the beginning of incubation (probably in conjunction with food-begging).

In winter often stays close to the same tree or grove of trees (i.e. in [[park]]s, large gardens, or cemeteries). Usual when approached, the owl will freezes with its body stiffly upright, eyes closed to narrow slits and ear tufts erect. This is called the \u201ctall-thin position\u201d and is common to at least a couple dozen species of typical owl. If approached closed, the owls will alternately open and close their eyes (apparently having stirred but trying to fool potential predators into thinking the owl is still at rest), finally lowering ear tufts, fluffing body plumage and flying to another roost.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Mikkola2/> Unlike most owls, which show a tendency towards territorial behavior on a fixed range year-around when possible, long-eared owls in the non-breeding season are often prone to occur in [[Aggregation (ethology)|aggregations]] of owls while roosting. Such grouping may not uncommonly include up to 6 to 50 owls at times, with a European record of about 150 owls at a single roost.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Hume/><ref name= Mikkola2/><ref name= Bent/> Even other migratory owls in the temperate zone do not tolerate each other as closely as do long-eared owls, with short-eared owls seemingly only forming aggregations when food supplies are exceptionally high, while social roosting in long-eared owls seems to occur regardless of local prey numbers.<ref name= Mikkola2/><ref name= Schneider>Schneider, K.

Roost height in the New Jersey study was at {{convert|3|to|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} or occasionally higher. In New Jersey, different roosts were preferred each year and in the local heavily modified environment, the owls become partially habituated to human activities. However, approach at closer than {{convert|3|to|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} away usually caused them to flush. Departure of owls for nighttime hunting would generally occur between 40 and 49 minutes after sundown.<ref name=Bosakowski/> Studies in the [[Moscow]] region of wintering roosts were done over 10 years, with 12 communal and 14 solitary roosts found. The communal roosts included up to 16 individuals per winter, with a mean of 9.9. Overall, the average in Moscow per roost site was 2.1 owl(s). [[Vole]] numbers the preceding year were likely the causes of numeric variations in years here while wind and snow avoidance were key in characteristics of roost sites.<ref name= Sharikov>Sharikov, A.

Long-eared owls either disregarded or killed but did not eat [[amphibian]]s, while tawny owls did catch and eat amphibians when they were available. Occasionally the tawny owls would attack fish whilst one long-eared owl caught but did not eat a fish. The European study further revealed that several owls of different species ate bits of plant and did not appear to do so out of food deprivation or hunger.<ref name= Raber>R\u00e4ber, H. (1949).

One study accrued information from 312 studies from around the species\u2019 range. In total 478 prey species were found to be described, of which 180 were [[mammal]] species, 191 were [[bird]] species, 83 were assorted [[invertebrate]] species, 15 were [[reptile]]s, 7 were [[amphibian]]s, and reportedly just a couple [[fish]] species.

Ardea, 97(4), 615-625.</ref> However, on closer inspection, the long-eared owl generally appears to be something of a dietary specialist. It usually takes primarily, often nearly entirely, small [[mammal]]s, e.g. [[rodent]]s, as food in almost every part of its range. Usually a broad picture emerges that between 80 and 99% of the diet consists of mammals, averaging 94% in one estimate for all of Europe. However, in [[Subtropics|warmer]], [[Island|insular]] or more [[Peri-urbanisation|urbanized]] environments, a greater percentage or, rarely, even a majority of the diet can locally be non-mammalian prey.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Konig/><ref name= Birrer/><ref name= Marti2>Marti, C.

In accordance with the cyclic nature of vole populations, the local numbers of long-eared owls can rise and fall sharply. In low vole years, they tend to lay fewer eggs and feed fewer young, and may not attempt to breed at all. In high vole years, they generally lay and hatch more eggs and rear more young. While incubation starts with first egg, only the oldest siblings may be feed in low food years.

A wide variety of owls are especially likely to be encountered both in terms of shared [[nocturnality]] and a shared preference for rodent prey, which is favored by about 75% of owls found in North America and about 85% of the owls found in Europe and occasionally favored by nearly all owls in both continents.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Johnsgard/><ref name= Mikkola2/> Much study has gone into contrasting the ecology of long-eared owls against other owls and also occasionally diurnal birds of prey, especially in terms of differences in dietary habits and habitat preferences. In Europe, arguably the most populous owl is likely the [[tawny owl]], which has therefore warranted a considerable number of comparisons with long-eared owls. While tawny owls overlap in prey preferences with the long-eared owl, it tends to show greater dietary flexibility, with larger contributions of secondary prey such as birds, reptiles and amphibians and insects. For example, in southern Sweden, the [[Niche differentiation|food niche breadth]] of tawny owls was roughly three times greater than that of long-eared owls. Generally tawny owls prefer more extensively [[Woodland|wooded environments]] than long-eared owls but can adapt as well as the long-eared to [[forest fragmentation]] and [[peri-urbanisation]], thus often competing rather directly over foods. While the tawny owl usually selects slightly larger prey on average than long-eared owls, often over {{convert|30|g|oz|abbr=on}} mean prey mass, studied size of common voles hunted in central Lithuania showed that both long-eared and tawny owls selected larger than average voles, with average caught estimated at {{convert|21.45|g|oz|abbr=on}} against the average weight surveyed by humans at {{convert|16.42|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Surprisingly, especially in the non-breeding season in this study, long-eared owls in Lithuania tended to select larger voles on average (at {{convert|21.56|g|oz|abbr=on}}) than did tawny owls ({{convert|19.56|g|oz|abbr=on}}).<ref name= Raber/><ref name= Balciauskas>Balciauskas, L., & Balciauskiene, L.

However, the long-eared owl takes larger prey on average usually than little owls, since it focuses more on rodents rather than invertebrates like [[insect]]s and [[earthworm]]s and, especially during winter, varies its prey compositions less so than the smaller species. Also, the long-eared owl requires some timbered spots for roosting purposes while little owls can adapt to both treeless and partially treed areas as well as, in [[Spain]] at least, more heavily modified areas by humans.<ref name= Martinez/><ref name= Scott/><ref name= Sekour/><ref name= Romanowski>Romanowski, J.

Other than occasional predatory interactions, competition is limited with most of these diurnal birds of prey due to the temporal differences of their habits.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Mikkola2/><ref name=  Roulin>Roulin, A.

Despite considerable overlap in both range and diet, long-eared owls are largely buffered from considerable competition with short-eared owls by habitat preferences, as the short-eared owls always venture to more open habitats, generally roosting and nesting in [[Grass|tall grasses]] rather than timber, and seldom, if ever, hunt in the same edge habitats as the long-eared species.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Mikkola2/><ref name= Selcuk/> In western [[Russia]] when compared to short-eared owl, long-eared owl showed less of a tendency to appear in cluster where prey was concentrated, most likely because of the habitat differences. In both western Russia and further east in western [[Siberia]], the short-eared tended to take more [[tundra vole]]s in addition to common voles, while long-eared owls focused more exclusively on common voles.<ref name= Dupal/><ref name= Volkov>Volkov, S.

Entomological Review, 88(10), 1248-1257.</ref> Comparisons between barn and long-eared owls have been made in many areas of the latter species less extensive range. The habitats used by the barn and long-eared owls are not mutually exclusive nor are their prey species. Despite being similar aerial hunters of open areas, barn owls differ in life history in many respects from long-eared owls, in part by being cavity nesters. While their dietary habits can appear similar and show similar dependence on small mammals, barn owls are somewhat more generalized and catholic as feeders, with less of a heavy reliance on voles. Barn owls can live quite well on virtually any small mammal assemblage. In some parts of Europe, the two species\u2019 food niche breadth is comparable or even slightly higher in the long-eared. However, globally barn owls are much more wide-ranging, more tropical in their central range and globally have a much wider prey spectrum than long-eared owls. Barn owls are also more widely adaptive to [[Island|insular]] living than long-eared owls, and are capable living proficiently on a diversity of prey classes even in environments completely lacking small mammals.<ref name= Yalden/><ref name= Alivizatos/><ref name= Sekour/><ref name= Leader2/><ref name= Roulin/><ref name= Capizzi>Capizzi, D., & Luigi Canou, P.

Consequently, in the Americas, barn owls tend to consistently take slightly larger prey than long-eared owls and tend to access a broader overall [[Ecological niche|feeding niche]].<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Marti/><ref name= Barrows/><ref name= Marks2/> Despite the great adaptability and range of the barn owl, it was found in a study from [[France]] that they experience higher mortality due to starvation than long-eared and tawny owls. This was attributed to the barn owl's inferior [[Fatty acid metabolism|lipid fat reserves]] while they attempt to survive the cooler seasons within [[temperate climate]]s, as they are better suited to survival in warmer climates.<ref name= Massemin>Massemin, S., & Handrich, Y.

The Condor, 99(4), 969-971.</ref>\n\nNorth America has more species of owl than Europe and can be considered a more competitive environment for long-eared owls living there. However, again, in most cases habitat preferences, slight partitioning in dietary preferences (which may be in prey species or body sizes of prey selected) and life histories generally allow most species to persist even when living in proximity to one another.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Johnsgard/> As throughout their range, long-eared owls tend to differ from most other North American owls by being much more migratory in nature. Therefore, [[Population cycle|cyclic food variations]] affect them differently and are less likely to be the direct cause of winter mortality than in more permanently residential owls.<ref name= BNA/><ref name= Cheveau/><ref name= Krebs>Krebs, C.

In this regard, long-eared owls are much more often the victims rather than the predators. Their generally successful life history on the contrary often makes long-eared owls perhaps more vulnerable than most other medium-sized owls to predations and even perhaps many smaller owl species. These include nesting in relatively open abandoned bird nests rather than hard to access cavities. Also, long-eared owls tendency to occur in quite open areas whilst hunting coupled with the loud vocalizations (including begging calls of their fledglings) and other auditory displays are all likely to court predators.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Mikkola2/><ref name= Earhart/><ref name= Mikkola3>Mikkola, H.

It is likely that largely perch hunting raptor such as ''[[Buteo]]'' and most [[eagle]]s may either chance upon an owl roost during a hunting foray or encounter a long-eared owl perhaps during overlapping activity around dawn or dusk, while large [[falcon]]s are likely to only strike one down when an owl is flushed during daytime. Goshawks and other ''[[Accipiter]]'' hawks are a particularly deadly threat among diurnal raptors due to their intensive searching hunting methods and willingness to dive into wooded thickets holding roosting owls.<ref name= Mikkola2/><ref name= Mikkola3/><ref name= Sergio2>Sergio, F., & Hiraldo, F.

The Slovenian average number of owls hatched was 2.4 per nest (5.3 per successful nest) and the average number of owls fledged was 1.6 per nest (3.9 per successful nest).<ref name= Tome3/> In [[Province of Pisa|Pisa]], [[Italy]], long-eared owl pairs produced a mean of 0.95 per territorial pair and 2.13 per successful pair.<ref name= Sergio/> In central Slovenia, 57 nests produced an average of 5.7 eggs per clutch. Of the 51 fledged owls, 31 died in the study, 22 of which were due to mammal and bird predation, 6 due to starvation, 2 due to road collisions and 1 drowned in ditch.<ref name= Tome3/> In Britain, the most common diagnosed cause of nest failure was egg theft by humans (accounting for 28.2% of 46 failed nests).<ref name= Glue/> Banding studies show that the long-eared owl typically have a short lifespan, with more than 91% of 105 owls recovered in North America of determined age being 4 years or younger. The oldest recorded in these efforts was banded in New York and recovered in Ontario at the age of 11 years and 4 months. Another one may have been over 15 years old, however.<ref name= Houston/> One exceptional isolated record is known of a European long-eared owl of just under 28 years of age.<ref name= Konig/><ref name= Cramp/> Annual survivorship in Germany and Switzerland for adults is 69%.<ref name= Glutz/>\n [[File:Asio otus MWNH 2203.JPG|thumb|Eggs, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden]]]]\n\n==Status==\nThe long-eared owl is rather common and widespread in many regions. With a range of 80 million square kilometers, it is easily one of the most widely found owls. The [[IUCN]] estimates the total population between 2 million and 5.5 million, placing it as one of the most numerous owls beyond the wider ranging [[barn owl]] and less wide-ranging [[little owl]] (both likely between 5 and 10 million total birds) and roughly equaling the total population of great horned owls.<ref name= IUCN/><ref name= Sauer>Sauer, J.

A net total 0.98% decline was recorded over the survey time. This was considered the second greatest reduction behind [[short-eared owl]] and [[burrowing owl]] (''Athene cunicularia''), furthermore among the 19 raptors surveyed in Canada, these 3 owls showed the most declining trends. The long-eared owl was apparently the most scarce of the 6 sub-boreal owl species surveyed. A similar trend has been detected throughout North America with a very large net 1.6% reduction overall during [[Christmas Bird Count]]s (CBC), again making it the most severe decline for an owl behind only the short-eared owl and the two related owl species seemed to have had the most severe declines of all 28 raptor species mentioned in these CBC surveys.<ref name= Kirk/>\n\n==References==<!-- AnimalBiology58:211. -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==In art==\n[[John James Audubon]] illustrates the \"Long-eared Owl - ''Strix otus''\" as Plate 383 in Birds of America, published London, 1827\u201338.
