Please do not remove or replace without talk page consensus. Thank you.-->\n{{Masculinism sidebar}}\nA '''man''' is an adult [[male]] human. Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a [[boy]].\n\nLike most other male [[mammal]]s, a man's [[genome]] typically inherits an [[X chromosome|X&nbsp;chromosome]] from his mother and a [[Y chromosome|Y&nbsp;chromosome]] from his father. The male [[fetus]] generally produces larger amounts of [[androgen]]s and smaller amounts of [[estrogen]]s than a female fetus. This difference in the relative amounts of these [[sex steroid]]s is largely responsible for the [[physiology|physiological]] differences that distinguish men from women. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes. However, there are exceptions to the above for some [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] men.\n\n==Etymology and terminology==\n{{Main|Man (word)}}\nThe English term \"man\" is derived from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*man-'' (see [[Sanskrit]]/[[Avestan]] ''manu-'', [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''m\u01eb\u017e'' \"man, male\").<ref>''American Heritage Dictionary'', Appendix I: Indo-European Roots.

Accessed 2007-07-22.</ref> More directly, the word derives from [[Old English]] ''mann.'' The Old English form had a default meaning of \"adult male\" (which was the exclusive meaning of ''wer''), though it could also signify a person of unspecified gender. The closely related Old English pronoun ''man'' was used just as it is in Modern German to designate  \"one\" (e.&nbsp;g., in the saying ''man muss mit den W\u00f6lfen heulen'').<ref>[[John Richard Clark Hall]]: A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary</ref>\n\n== Biology == <!-- Please don't rename to \"...sex\" as there is a link from \"woman\" here. Biology and sex is redundant here, whereas this section does discuss gender in paragraph 5 -->\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\n{{Main|Secondary sexual characteristics|Sex differences in humans}}\n{{see also|Trans man|Intersexuality}}\n\nIn human beings, the sex of an individual is determined at the time of [[fertilization]] by the genetic material carried in the [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] cell. If a sperm cell carrying an [[X chromosome]] fertilizes the [[ovum|egg]], the offspring will typically be female (XX). On the other hand, if a sperm cell carrying a [[Y chromosome]] fertilizes the egg, the offspring will typically be male (XY). Persons whose anatomy or chromosomal makeup differ from this pattern are referred to as [[intersex]].\n\nLike most other male [[mammal]]s, a man's [[genome]] typically inherits an [[X chromosome|X&nbsp;chromosome]] from his mother and a [[Y chromosome|Y&nbsp;chromosome]] from his father. The male [[fetus]] produces larger amounts of [[androgen]]s and smaller amounts of [[estrogen]]s than a female fetus. This difference in the relative amounts of these [[sex steroid]]s is largely responsible for the [[physiology|physiological]] differences that distinguish men from women.\n\nHumans exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]] in many characteristics, many of which have no direct link to reproductive ability, although most of these characteristics do have a role in sexual attraction. Most expressions of sexual dimorphism in humans are found in height, weight, and body structure, though there are always examples that do not follow the overall pattern. For example, men tend to be taller than women, but there are many people of both sexes who are in the mid-height range for the species.\n\nPrimary sex characteristics (or sex organs) are characteristics that are present at birth and are integral to the reproductive process. For men, primary sex characteristics include the penis and testicles. Secondary sex characteristics are features that appear during [[puberty]] in [[human]]s.<ref name=\"Melmed\">{{cite book |vauthors=Melmed S, Polonsky KS, Larsen PR, Kronenberg HM|title=Williams Textbook of Endocrinology E-Book|publisher=[[Elsevier Health Sciences]]|isbn=1437736009|year=2011|page=1054|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbg1QOAObicC&pg=PA1054}}</ref><ref name=\"Pack\">{{cite book |vauthors=Pack PE|title=CliffsNotes AP Biology, 5th Edition|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|isbn=0544784170|year=2016|page=219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsalDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA219}}</ref> Such features are especially evident in the [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] [[phenotypic trait]]s that distinguish between the sexes, but\u2014unlike the primary sex characteristics\u2014are not directly part of the [[reproductive system]].<ref name=\"Bjorklund\">{{cite book |vauthors=Bjorklund DF, Blasi CH|title=Child and Adolescent Development: An Integrated Approach|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=113316837X|year=2011|pages=152\u2013153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTQIAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA152}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://sciencing.com/primary-secondary-sexual-characteristics-8557301.html|title=Primary & Secondary Sexual Characteristics|work=Sciencing.com|date=30 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Reproduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4RlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA103|year=2018|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-815145-7|page=103}}</ref> Secondary sexual characteristics that are specific to men include:\n[[File:Male pelvic structures.svg|thumb|right|200px|Human male reproductive anatomy and surroundings]]\n* [[Facial hair]];<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n* Chest hair;<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Secondary+sexual+characteristics|title=Secondary sexual characteristics|website=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref>\n* Broadened shoulders;<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Kathleen Stassen|title=The Developing Person Through the Life Span|url=https://archive.org/details/developingperson00berg_0|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=Worth Publishers|isbn=978-0-7167-5706-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/developingperson00berg_0/page/349 349]}}</ref>\n* An enlarged larynx (also known as an [[Adam's apple]]);<ref name=\"auto2\"/> and\n* A voice that is significantly deeper than the voice of a child or a woman.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Reproductive system===\n{{main|Male reproductive system (human)}}\nThe male reproductive system includes external and internal genitalia. The male external genitalia consist of the [[human penis|penis]], the male urethra, and the scrotum, while the male internal genitalia consist of the testes, the prostate, the epididymis, the seminal vesicle, the vas deferens, the ejaculatory duct, and the bulbourethral gland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33684|title=Definition of Male genitalia|website=MedicineNet}}</ref>\n\nThe male reproductive system's function is to produce [[semen]], which carries [[spermatozoon|sperm]] and thus [[DNA|genetic information]] that can unite with an egg within a woman. Since sperm that enters a woman's [[uterus]] and then [[fallopian tubes]] goes on to [[Fertilization|fertilize]] an egg which develops into a [[fetus]] or child, the male reproductive system plays no necessary role during the [[gestation]]. The study of male reproduction and associated organs is called [[andrology]].\n\n[[File:NHGRI human male karyotype.png|thumbnail|left|[[Karyogram]] of human male using [[Giemsa]] staining. Human males typically possess an [[Sex determination and differentiation (human)|XY combination]].]]\n\n===Sex hormones===\n\nIn mammals, the [[hormones]] that influence sexual differentiation and development are [[androgens]] (mainly [[testosterone]]), which stimulate later development of the ovary. In the sexually undifferentiated [[embryo]], testosterone stimulates the development of the [[Wolffian duct]]s, the penis, and closure of the [[labioscrotal folds]] into the scrotum.  Another significant hormone in sexual differentiation is the [[anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone]], which inhibits the development of the [[M\u00fcllerian duct]]s. For males during puberty, testosterone, along with [[gonadotropin]]s released by the [[pituitary gland]], stimulates [[spermatogenesis]].\n\n===Health===\n{{Main|Gender disparities in health}}\nMen are biologically the weaker sex.

Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a [[boy]].\n\nLike most other male [[mammal]]s, a man's [[genome]] typically inherits an [[X chromosome|X&nbsp;chromosome]] from his mother and a [[Y chromosome|Y&nbsp;chromosome]] from his father. The male [[fetus]] generally produces larger amounts of [[androgen]]s and smaller amounts of [[estrogen]]s than a female fetus. This difference in the relative amounts of these [[sex steroid]]s is largely responsible for the [[physiology|physiological]] differences that distinguish men from women. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes. However, there are exceptions to the above for some [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] men.\n\n==Etymology and terminology==\n{{Main|Man (word)}}\nThe English term \"man\" is derived from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*man-'' (see [[Sanskrit]]/[[Avestan]] ''manu-'', [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''m\u01eb\u017e'' \"man, male\").<ref>''American Heritage Dictionary'', Appendix I: Indo-European Roots.

Accessed 2007-07-22.</ref> More directly, the word derives from [[Old English]] ''mann.'' The Old English form had a default meaning of \"adult male\" (which was the exclusive meaning of ''wer''), though it could also signify a person of unspecified gender. The closely related Old English pronoun ''man'' was used just as it is in Modern German to designate  \"one\" (e.&nbsp;g., in the saying ''man muss mit den W\u00f6lfen heulen'').<ref>[[John Richard Clark Hall]]: A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary</ref>\n\n== Biology == <!-- Please don't rename to \"...sex\" as there is a link from \"woman\" here. Biology and sex is redundant here, whereas this section does discuss gender in paragraph 5 -->\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\n{{Main|Secondary sexual characteristics|Sex differences in humans}}\n{{see also|Trans man|Intersexuality}}\n\nIn human beings, the sex of an individual is determined at the time of [[fertilization]] by the genetic material carried in the [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] cell. If a sperm cell carrying an [[X chromosome]] fertilizes the [[ovum|egg]], the offspring will typically be female (XX). On the other hand, if a sperm cell carrying a [[Y chromosome]] fertilizes the egg, the offspring will typically be male (XY). Persons whose anatomy or chromosomal makeup differ from this pattern are referred to as [[intersex]].\n\nLike most other male [[mammal]]s, a man's [[genome]] typically inherits an [[X chromosome|X&nbsp;chromosome]] from his mother and a [[Y chromosome|Y&nbsp;chromosome]] from his father. The male [[fetus]] produces larger amounts of [[androgen]]s and smaller amounts of [[estrogen]]s than a female fetus. This difference in the relative amounts of these [[sex steroid]]s is largely responsible for the [[physiology|physiological]] differences that distinguish men from women.\n\nHumans exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]] in many characteristics, many of which have no direct link to reproductive ability, although most of these characteristics do have a role in sexual attraction. Most expressions of sexual dimorphism in humans are found in height, weight, and body structure, though there are always examples that do not follow the overall pattern. For example, men tend to be taller than women, but there are many people of both sexes who are in the mid-height range for the species.\n\nPrimary sex characteristics (or sex organs) are characteristics that are present at birth and are integral to the reproductive process. For men, primary sex characteristics include the penis and testicles. Secondary sex characteristics are features that appear during [[puberty]] in [[human]]s.<ref name=\"Melmed\">{{cite book |vauthors=Melmed S, Polonsky KS, Larsen PR, Kronenberg HM|title=Williams Textbook of Endocrinology E-Book|publisher=[[Elsevier Health Sciences]]|isbn=1437736009|year=2011|page=1054|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbg1QOAObicC&pg=PA1054}}</ref><ref name=\"Pack\">{{cite book |vauthors=Pack PE|title=CliffsNotes AP Biology, 5th Edition|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|isbn=0544784170|year=2016|page=219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsalDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA219}}</ref> Such features are especially evident in the [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] [[phenotypic trait]]s that distinguish between the sexes, but\u2014unlike the primary sex characteristics\u2014are not directly part of the [[reproductive system]].<ref name=\"Bjorklund\">{{cite book |vauthors=Bjorklund DF, Blasi CH|title=Child and Adolescent Development: An Integrated Approach|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=113316837X|year=2011|pages=152\u2013153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTQIAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA152}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://sciencing.com/primary-secondary-sexual-characteristics-8557301.html|title=Primary & Secondary Sexual Characteristics|work=Sciencing.com|date=30 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Reproduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4RlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA103|year=2018|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-815145-7|page=103}}</ref> Secondary sexual characteristics that are specific to men include:\n[[File:Male pelvic structures.svg|thumb|right|200px|Human male reproductive anatomy and surroundings]]\n* [[Facial hair]];<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n* Chest hair;<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Secondary+sexual+characteristics|title=Secondary sexual characteristics|website=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref>\n* Broadened shoulders;<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Kathleen Stassen|title=The Developing Person Through the Life Span|url=https://archive.org/details/developingperson00berg_0|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=Worth Publishers|isbn=978-0-7167-5706-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/developingperson00berg_0/page/349 349]}}</ref>\n* An enlarged larynx (also known as an [[Adam's apple]]);<ref name=\"auto2\"/> and\n* A voice that is significantly deeper than the voice of a child or a woman.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Reproductive system===\n{{main|Male reproductive system (human)}}\nThe male reproductive system includes external and internal genitalia. The male external genitalia consist of the [[human penis|penis]], the male urethra, and the scrotum, while the male internal genitalia consist of the testes, the prostate, the epididymis, the seminal vesicle, the vas deferens, the ejaculatory duct, and the bulbourethral gland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33684|title=Definition of Male genitalia|website=MedicineNet}}</ref>\n\nThe male reproductive system's function is to produce [[semen]], which carries [[spermatozoon|sperm]] and thus [[DNA|genetic information]] that can unite with an egg within a woman. Since sperm that enters a woman's [[uterus]] and then [[fallopian tubes]] goes on to [[Fertilization|fertilize]] an egg which develops into a [[fetus]] or child, the male reproductive system plays no necessary role during the [[gestation]]. The study of male reproduction and associated organs is called [[andrology]].\n\n[[File:NHGRI human male karyotype.png|thumbnail|left|[[Karyogram]] of human male using [[Giemsa]] staining. Human males typically possess an [[Sex determination and differentiation (human)|XY combination]].]]\n\n===Sex hormones===\n\nIn mammals, the [[hormones]] that influence sexual differentiation and development are [[androgens]] (mainly [[testosterone]]), which stimulate later development of the ovary. In the sexually undifferentiated [[embryo]], testosterone stimulates the development of the [[Wolffian duct]]s, the penis, and closure of the [[labioscrotal folds]] into the scrotum.  Another significant hormone in sexual differentiation is the [[anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone]], which inhibits the development of the [[M\u00fcllerian duct]]s. For males during puberty, testosterone, along with [[gonadotropin]]s released by the [[pituitary gland]], stimulates [[spermatogenesis]].\n\n===Health===\n{{Main|Gender disparities in health}}\nAlthough in general men suffer from many of the same illnesses as women, they suffer from slightly more illnesses in comparison to women.

In order to ensure the success of the truck of [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]], Clear Channel contracted the team of Tom Meents (who was already popular from driving Monster Patrol and [[Bulldozer (truck)|Bulldozer]]) to build and campaign the \"Goldberg\" truck. Meents debuted in the truck in January 2000 at the [[Georgia Dome]], where he won racing and finished third in [[freestyle (monster trucks)|freestyle]]. As the year progressed, and as [[Dennis Anderson]] struggled in [[Grave Digger (truck)|Grave Digger]], Meents dominated and capped the year by winning the first [[Monster Jam World Finals]] Racing Championship. The following year saw a continuation of the dominance, when Meents won the world racing and freestyle championships.\n\nIn 2001, WCW was bought out by the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and the deal with Clear Channel was dropped. For 2002, Meents kept the same truck and body but renamed the truck Team Meents, even retaining much of Goldberg's color scheme and graphics. Once again, Meents swept both the racing and freestyle at World Finals 3.\n\nIn 2003, saw the truck change both name and image to become Maximum Destruction, a name which Meents had intended to run the year before until he delayed those plans out of respect for the [[September 11 attacks]]. Neil Elliot began driving a second truck for the team that year as well. The team has remained significantly popular, and is now generally introduced as the chief rival of Grave Digger, the tours' most popular team.\n[[Image:Maximum destruction.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Tom Meents signing autographs in front of Maximum Destruction]]\n\nIn 2005 Meents jumped Maximum Destruction over his old house, before destroying the house with the truck.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Still going strong: Meents still having fun driving monster trucks|work=Paxton Record|url = http://www.paxtonrecord.net/sports/prep-sports/miscellaneous/2011-12-14/still-going-strong-meents-still-having-fun-driving-monst|accessdate = August 28, 2015|last = Hinton|first = Dave|date = December 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Maximum Destruction celebrated 10 years. The trucks were painted in a new livery featuring spikes around the body, and the truck began to be known as \"Max-D\". At World Finals 14, Meents won freestyle in Max-D, earning his 11th World Finals Championship.\n\nIn 2016, Meents's two stepsons, Colton and Jared Eichelberger, joined the team. At World Finals 17, both Meents and Colton competed in the main events while Jared competed in the Young Guns Shootout. During the racing encore, Meents jumped his truck over five monster trucks. In an attempt to break this record, he tried to jump over six trucks in April at [[Levis Stadium]], though the trucks were positioned to either side of the area Meents was jumping, thus not breaking the record. This was mainly because of the conditions of the muddy track. He later reattempted this, successfully jumping over six trucks later in the same month at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nIn 2017, Meents sustained an injury and was unable to compete. Due to his injury, Meents did not compete in World Finals 18. Dennis Anderson also sustained an injury, making this the first time where Meents and Anderson both did not compete in the World Finals; Anderson would retire after that season.\n\nIn 2018, at World Finals 19, the Max-D team celebrated their 15-year anniversary of the truck with a special encore after competition ended, featuring all the Max-D trucks throughout the past years, including the original Maximum Destruction truck.\n\n==Signature elements==\nSince the truck debuted as Goldberg, the truck has become known for bouncy and wild rides, and for its ability to make large jumps and take several hits during freestyle runs and not suffer significant damage. The truck is also known for its numerous crashes, often simply as a result of Meents' full-throttle driving. Meents' driving style is emulated by the other drivers, who are said to have graduated from the \"Tom Meents School of Monster Truck Driving\".\n\nMaximum Destruction is one of the few teams in the modern monster truck industry to use a front-mounted engines.\n\n=== Backflips ===\nDuring the freestyle portion of a European tour event in Gothenburg, Sweden, Meents hit the backside of a 'step up' jump which caused the truck to rotate backwards, land on the roof at the top of the obstacle and then continue to roll backwards back onto the wheels where Meents continued his run. This inspired drivers to attempt a complete aerial backflip. [[Travis Pastrana]] made an attempt during a Season 1 episode of [[Nitro Circus (TV series)|''Nitro Circus'']] using a purpose-built ramp. However, the truck did not get enough rotation and slammed down onto the roof from about 40 feet in the air; Pastran was uninjured.\n\nIn 2009, at World Finals 10 in [[Las Vegas]], Meents rolled on to the floor during the encore in Maximum Destruction. Nobody knew what he was going to do until he launched his truck off the backside of the center jump, which was almost a solid wall of dirt. The truck instantly bounced up into the air and managed to rotate one and half times backwards until landing on the tailgate, resulting in the truck rolling onto its roof. Although spectacular, it did not technically count because he did not land on his tires. It was later revealed in a special DVD release about Meents' build up to the backflip at the World Finals, that he had, in fact, landed a complete backflip in his backyard during testing. Therefore, Meents was the first to land a successful backflip. In 2010, Cam McQueen, driving Pastrana's Nitro Circus truck, completed a backflip in Jacksonville, Florida. This was the first backflip landed in competition.\n\nSince then, there have been many successful and unsuccessful attempts from several drivers. A few drivers have even completed corkscrew type flips where the truck backflips and lands facing the opposite direction. Linsey Weenk, driver of the [[Lucas Oil Crusader]] truck, was the first driver to land two backflips in one scored freestyle run.\n\nAfter George Balhan, driver of Mohawk Warrior, landed two consecutive backflips at the 2012 Monster Jam World Finals, Meents was driven to land the double. After months of preparation at his shop in Paxton, Illinois, on June 16, 2012, at the last show of the [[Monster Jam Path of Destruction Tour]] at [[Metlife Stadium]] in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Meents came out in a modified Maximum Destruction stunt truck, built specifically for the double backflip. When Meents hit the jump, his truck completed one rotation, but started to twist in the second rotation then landing on the roof, coming up just short. Then, on Saturday, March 23, 2013, he attempted it again in the encore portion of Monster Jam World Finals 14. The truck landed on the sides of the left side tires, and bounced into a perfect landing, becoming the first successful double backflip. A double backflip has yet to be landed in competition.\n\n== Trucks ==\n[[File:Max D.jpg|thumb|Max D in 2013]]\nSince the debut of the Maximum Destruction name in 2003, there have been 11 trucks fielded by the team:\n\n*1 \u2013 Debuted in 2000 as Goldberg, became Maximum Destruction in 2003, retired in 2009\n*2 \u2013 Debuted in 2003, retired in 2011\n*3 \u2013 Debuted in 2010, retired in 2016\n*3.5 \u2013 A display-only truck built in 2010\n*4 \u2013 Debuted in 2012, retired in 2017 and now used as a display truck\n*5 \u2013  Debuted in 2012, retired in 2017\n*5.5 \u2013  Debuted in 2012, specially designed truck used only for special stunts\n*6 \u2013 Debuted in 2016, currently driven by Colton Eichelberger\n*7 \u2013 Debuted in 2017, currently driven by Blake Granger\n*8 \u2013 Debuted in 2017, currently driven by Tom Meents\n*9 \u2013 Debuted in 2018, currently driven by Neil Elliott\n\nAdditionally, the Maximum Destruction body design has been used on chassis owned by Monster Jam parent [[Feld Entertainment]] for international tours; these do not feature the front-mounted engine usually used by the team.\n\n==Drivers==\n=== Current ===\n*Tom Meents (since 2000)\n*Neil Elliott (since 2003)\n*Colton Eichelberger (since 2016)\n*Blake Granger (since 2017)\n*Chuck Werner (part-time; usually drives [[El Toro Loco]])\n\n=== Former ===\n*Morgan Kane (2014\u20132016)\n*Kreg Christensen (2009\u20132014)\n*Jared Eichelberger (2016\u20132019)\n\n== World Finals history ==\n*Racing championships: 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2011, 2012\n*Freestyle championships: 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2013\n*2-wheel skills championships: 2019\n\n'''NOTE''': All championships have been won by Meents.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of monster trucks]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071016193018/http://crushcars.com/ Tom Meents & Maximum Destruction Official Website]\n*[https://www.monsterjam.com/en-US/trucks/max-d Max-D on monsterjam.com]\n*[https://www.monsterjam.com/en-US/drivers/tom-meents Tom Meents on monsterjam.com ]\n*[https://www.monsterjam.com/en-US/drivers/neil-elliott Neil Elliot on monsterjam.com]\n*[https://www.monsterjam.com/en-US/drivers/colton-eichelberger Colton Eichelberger on monsterjam.com]\n*[https://www.monsterjam.com/en-US/drivers/jared-eichelberger Jared Eichelberger on monsterjam.com]\n*[https://www.monsterjam.com/en-US/drivers/blake-granger Blake Granger on monsterjam.com]\n\n{{Monster Jam|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maximum Destruction}}\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Monster trucks]]\n[[Category:Off-road vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sports entertainment]]\n[[Category:Vehicles introduced in 1978]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=August 2015}}\n{{Infobox Monstertruck\n|name=Maximum Destruction\n|image=Max-D Jacksonville 2014.jpg\n|caption=Maximum Destruction in 2014\n|owner=Tom Meents\n|driver=[[#Drivers|Multiple]]\n|home_city=[[Paxton, Illinois]]\n|year_created=2000\n|previous =Goldberg (2000\u20132001)<br>Team Meents (2002)\n|style=Futuristic SUV\n|chassis=Willman\n|engine=540 CID Merlin\n|transmission = Coan 2-speed\n|tires=BKT\n}}\n\n'''Maximum Destruction''', also known as '''Max-D''', is a [[monster truck]] team owned by [[Tom Meents]] that runs as part of the [[Monster Jam]] circuit.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Maximum Destruction Truck 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Maximum Destruction's original look used from 2003 to 2012]]\nIn 1999, [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]] (now [[Feld Entertainment]]) signed a contract with [[World Championship Wrestling]] to create monster trucks based on popular professional wrestlers. In order to ensure the success of the truck of [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]], Clear Channel contracted the team of Tom Meents (who was already popular from driving Monster Patrol and [[Bulldozer (truck)|Bulldozer]]) to build and campaign the \"Goldberg\" truck. Meents debuted in the truck in January 2000 at the [[Georgia Dome]], where he won racing and finished third in [[freestyle (monster trucks)|freestyle]]. As the year progressed, and as [[Dennis Anderson]] struggled in [[Grave Digger (truck)|Grave Digger]], Meents dominated and capped the year by winning the first [[Monster Jam World Finals]] Racing Championship. The following year saw a continuation of the dominance, when Meents won the world racing and freestyle championships.\n\nIn 2001, WCW was bought out by the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and the deal with Clear Channel was dropped. For 2002, Meents kept the same truck and body but renamed the truck Team Meents, even retaining much of Goldberg's color scheme and graphics. Once again, Meents swept both the racing and freestyle at World Finals 3.\n\nIn 2003, saw the truck change both name and image to become Maximum Destruction, a name which Meents had intended to run the year before until he delayed those plans out of respect for the [[September 11 attacks]]. Neil Elliot began driving a second truck for the team that year as well. The team has remained significantly popular, and is now generally introduced as the chief rival of Grave Digger, the tours' most popular team.\n[[Image:Maximum destruction.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Tom Meents signing autographs in front of Maximum Destruction]]\n\nIn 2005 Meents jumped Maximum Destruction over his old house, before destroying the house with the truck.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Still going strong: Meents still having fun driving monster trucks|work=Paxton Record|url = http://www.paxtonrecord.net/sports/prep-sports/miscellaneous/2011-12-14/still-going-strong-meents-still-having-fun-driving-monst|accessdate = 2015-08-28|last = Hinton|first = Dave|date = 14 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Maximum Destruction celebrated 10 years. The trucks were painted in a new livery featuring spikes around the body, and the truck began to be known as \"Max-D\". At World Finals 14, Meents won freestyle in Max-D, earning his 11th World Finals Championship.\n\nIn 2016, Meents's two stepsons, Colton and Jared Eichelberger, joined the team. At World Finals 17, both Meents and Colton competed in the main events while Jared competed in the Young Guns Shootout. During the racing encore, Meents jumped his truck over five monster trucks. In an attempt to break this record, he tried to jump over six trucks in April at [[Levis Stadium]], though the trucks were positioned to either side of the area Meents was jumping, thus not breaking the record. This was mainly because of the conditions of the muddy track. He later reattempted this, successfully jumping over six trucks later in the same month at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nIn 2017, Meents sustained an injury and was unable to compete. Due to his injury, Meents did not compete in World Finals 18. Dennis Anderson also sustained an injury, making this the first time where Meents and Anderson both did not compete in the World Finals; Anderson would retire after that season.\n\nIn 2018, at World Finals 19, the Max-D team celebrated their 15-year anniversary of the truck with a special encore after competition ended, featuring all the Max-D trucks throughout the past years, including the original Maximum Destruction truck.\n\n==Signature elements==\nSince the truck debuted as Goldberg, the truck has become known for bouncy and wild rides, and for its ability to make large jumps and take several hits during freestyle runs and not suffer significant damage.

MEYER'''<br/>\n'''UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS'''}}\nFor service as set forth in the following:\n<br/>\n{{quote|  For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with Marine Embedded Training Team 2-8, Regional Corps Advisory Command 3-7, in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, on 8 September 2009. Corporal Meyer maintained security at a patrol rally point while other members of his team moved on foot with two platoons of Afghan National Army and Border Police into the village of Ganjgal for a pre-dawn meeting with village elders. Moving into the village, the patrol was ambushed by more than 50 enemy fighters firing rocket propelled grenades, mortars, and machine guns from houses and fortified positions on the slopes above. Hearing over the radio that four U.S. team members were cut off, Corporal Meyer seized the initiative. With a fellow Marine driving, Corporal Meyer took the exposed gunner's position in a gun-truck as they drove down the steeply terraced terrain in a daring attempt to disrupt the enemy attack and locate the trapped U.S. team. Disregarding intense enemy fire now concentrated on their lone vehicle, Corporal Meyer killed a number of enemy fighters with the mounted machine guns and his rifle, some at near point blank range, as he and his driver made three solo trips into the ambush area. During the first two trips, he and his driver evacuated two dozen Afghan soldiers, many of whom were wounded. When one machine gun became inoperable, he directed a return to the rally point to switch to another gun-truck for a third trip into the ambush area where his accurate fire directly supported the remaining U.S. personnel and Afghan soldiers fighting their way out of the ambush. Despite a shrapnel wound to his arm, Corporal Meyer made two more trips into the ambush area in a third gun-truck accompanied by four other Afghan vehicles to recover more wounded Afghan soldiers and search for the missing U.S. team members. Still under heavy enemy fire, he dismounted the vehicle on the fifth trip and moved on foot to locate and recover the bodies of his team members. Meyer's daring initiative and bold fighting spirit throughout the 6-hour battle significantly disrupted the enemy's attack and inspired the members of the combined force to fight on. His unwavering courage and steadfast devotion to his U.S. and Afghan comrades in the face of almost certain death reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marines.mil/community/Pages/MedalofHonorSgtDakotaMeyer-Citation.aspx |title=Citation |author= |date= |work=Medal of Honor Sgt Dakota Meyer |publisher=United States Marine Corps |accessdate=15 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124043800/http://www.marines.mil/community/Pages/MedalofHonorSgtDakotaMeyer-citation.aspx|archivedate=November 24, 2011}}</ref>}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* [[Jason Dunham]]\n* [[Salvatore Giunta]]\n* [[Leroy Petry]]\n* [[Clinton Romesha]]\n* [[Ty Carter]]\n* [[William D.

MEYER'''<br/>\n'''UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS'''}}\nFor service as set forth in the following:\n<br/>\n{{quote|  For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with Marine Embedded Training Team 2-8, Regional Corps Advisory Command 3-7, in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, on 8 September 2009. Corporal Meyer maintained security at a patrol rally point while other members of his team moved on foot with two platoons of Afghan National Army and Border Police into the village of Ganjgal for a pre-dawn meeting with village elders. Moving into the village, the patrol was ambushed by more than 50 enemy fighters firing rocket propelled grenades, mortars, and machine guns from houses and fortified positions on the slopes above. Hearing over the radio that four U.S. team members were cut off, Corporal Meyer seized the initiative. With a fellow Marine driving, Corporal Meyer took the exposed gunner's position in a gun-truck as they drove down the steeply terraced terrain in a daring attempt to disrupt the enemy attack and locate the trapped U.S. team. Disregarding intense enemy fire now concentrated on their lone vehicle, Corporal Meyer killed a number of enemy fighters with the mounted machine guns and his rifle, some at near point blank range, as he and his driver made three solo trips into the ambush area. During the first two trips, he and his driver evacuated two dozen Afghan soldiers, many of whom were wounded. When one machine gun became inoperable, he directed a return to the rally point to switch to another gun-truck for a third trip into the ambush area where his accurate fire directly supported the remaining U.S. personnel and Afghan soldiers fighting their way out of the ambush. Despite a shrapnel wound to his arm, Corporal Meyer made two more trips into the ambush area in a third gun-truck accompanied by four other Afghan vehicles to recover more wounded Afghan soldiers and search for the missing U.S. team members. Still under heavy enemy fire, he dismounted the vehicle on the fifth trip and moved on foot to locate and recover the bodies of his team members. Meyer's daring initiative and bold fighting spirit throughout the 6-hour battle significantly disrupted the enemy's attack and inspired the members of the combined force to fight on. His unwavering courage and steadfast devotion to his U.S. and Afghan comrades in the face of almost certain death reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marines.mil/community/Pages/MedalofHonorSgtDakotaMeyer-Citation.aspx |title=Citation |author= |date= |work=Medal of Honor Sgt Dakota Meyer |publisher=United States Marine Corps |accessdate=15 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124043800/http://www.marines.mil/community/Pages/MedalofHonorSgtDakotaMeyer-citation.aspx|archivedate=November 24, 2011}}</ref>}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* [[Jason Dunham]]\n* [[Salvatore Giunta]]\n* [[Leroy Petry]]\n* [[Clinton Romesha]]\n* [[Ty Carter]]\n* [[William D.

Bupyeong-gu comprises an area of 12.35 square miles (31.98 square km), and has a population of 508,587.<ref>https://www.icbp.go.kr/open_content/bbs.do?act=detail&msg_no=54&bcd=Fboard_375</ref> It is located north of [[Namdong District|Namdong-gu]], east of [[Seo-gu, Incheon|Seo-gu]], and south of [[Gyeyang District|Gyeyang-gu]].  The city of [[Bucheon]], in neighboring [[Gyeonggi Province]], comprises its eastern limit.\n\n==History==\nBupyeong-gu was created as its own district in 1995 when 'Buk-gu' was split into 'Gyeyang-gu' and 'Bupyeong-gu' due to rapid growth in the region.<ref>http://www.icbp.go.kr/foreign/eng/introduction/origin.asp{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Before the 1970s, much of the area was rich farmland. However, with rapid industrial development and the construction of large apartment complexes, the farmland quickly disappeared leaving what is today a large urban district.\n\n===History of \"old Bupyeong\"===\nOld Bupyeong was an administrative district, distinctive from Incheon, before 1914, when the Japanese colonial government merged it with outer parts of old [[Incheon]] into Bucheon County. Bupyeong Metropolitan Prefecture (i.e. Buyeong Dohobu, \ubd80\ud3c9\ub3c4\ud638\ubd80) consisted of today's [[Bupyeong-gu]], [[Gyeyang-gu]], [[Seo District, Incheon|Seo-gu]](excepting Geomdan) in Incheon, [[Bucheon]] City in [[Gyeonggi]], and western part of [[Guro-gu]] in [[Seoul]]. In 1895, Bupyeong Metropolitan Prefecture was degraded to Bupyeong County. The city centre was in [[Gyesan]]-dong, [[Gyeyang-gu]]. The two remaining buildings of the Bupyeong prefecture office are located in Bupyeong Elementary School.\n\nOnly Sipjeong-dong was part of Juan township of old Incheon, other than old Bupyeong.\n\nOld Bupyeong was traditionally a district of higher hierarchy than old Incheon in the administrative district system before Incheon became a metropolitan prefecture in early [[Joseon]], and was a military centre for coastal Gyeonggi area, covering old Incheon, Tongjin, Gimpo, Yangcheon, Ansan, Siheung, Gwacheon, and so on.\n\n* January 1, 1968 Establishment of Buk-gu, Incheon, Gyeonggi-do.\n* July 1, 1981 Buk-gu, Incheon Direct Control City\n* January 1, 1988 Transfer of its western parts such as Geomam-dong and Yeonhui-dong to Seo-gu.\n* May 1, 1988 Elevated to autonomous district.\n* January 1, 1989 Gyeyang-myeon, Gimpo-gun, Gyeonggi-do included in Buk-gu.\n* January 1, 1995 Buk-gu, Incheon Metropolitan City\n* March 1, 1995 Name change from  Buk-gu to Bupyeong-gu, and creation of Gyeyang-gu by dividing part of Bupyeong-gu.\n* April 20, 2006 Sub-division of Samsan-dong to Samsan-1-dong and Samsan-2-dong.\n\n==Overview==\nAt the core of the district is [[Bupyeong Station]].  The station lies at the intersection of the Incheon Subway Line 1 and Seoul Subway Line 1, instantly making it one of the busiest subway stations in all of Korea. It is also possible to reach Bupyeong-Gu Office via Seoul Subway Line 7 and Incheon Subway Line 1.\n\nThe area around Bupyeong Station includes the Bupyeong Underground Market, which boasts hundreds of small shops selling mostly clothing and make-up, and the Bupyeong Cultural Street, a walking street which holds several performances and cultural events throughout the year.  The area also contains many restaurants and bars, making it a popular weekend destination for residents of Incheon.  Nearby is Bupyeong Market, a large traditional market where vendors sell fresh meat,  produce, and traditional medicine.\n\n[[GM Korea]], formerly [[Daewoo Motors]], has its company headquarters and largest automobile manufacturing plant in Bupyeong.
