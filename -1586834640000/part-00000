He worked as a lawyer for two years before serving in the [[United States Navy Reserve|United States Naval Reserve]] from 1942 to 1945 during [[World War II]]. Upon his return, Muskie served in the [[Maine Legislature|Maine State Legislature]] from 1946 to 1951 against heavy Republican opposition. Despite an unsuccessful bid for the mayoralty of [[Waterville, Maine|Waterville]], he was elected the 64th Governor of Maine in an upset victory as its first [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] in 1954. Although elected as a reform Governor, Muskie split from his [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]]; he amended [[Constitution of Maine|its constitution]] multiple times to consolidate power, suspended the \"[[as Maine goes, so goes the nation]]\" doctrine, pressed aggressive [[Expansionism|economic expansionism]] and instated strict environmental provisions.

A supporter of the civil rights movement, Muskie rallied support for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the creation of [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] and tapered [[Richard Nixon]]'s \"[[Imperial Presidency]]\" by advancing [[New Federalism]]. Muskie ran with Humphrey against Nixon in the 1968 presidential election, only to lose by 0.7 percentage points \u2013 one of the [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin#List|narrowest margins in U.S. history]].

Set in [[Houston]]'s [[Third Ward, Houston|Third Ward]], the film is a story about misunderstood young American adults learning how to deal with love and maturity.\n\n==Plot ==\nJason ([[Allen Payne]]) is a responsible young man who has a job in a television repair shop and lives at home with his hard-working mom ([[Suzzanne Douglas]]). Joshua ([[Bokeem Woodbine]]) is the younger brother, who is just released from prison. Previously traumatized by his father, Joshua is a volatile, disturbed ex-con who is obviously bound for a violent end. Joshua deals drugs for short-term cash and joins a crew plotting a [[bank robbery]].\n\nWhen Lyric ([[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]]) walks into the shop to buy a television, Jason meets his perfect match. She has dreams of escape, and inspires Jason to do romantic things like borrow a city bus to take her on a date. Their relationship continually grows and blossoms into love.  The height comes when Jason and Lyric take a romantic ride in a rowboat, then [[sexual intercourse|make love]] in the woods.\n\nIn a series of flashbacks, [[Forest Whitaker]] plays the boys' father, Mad Dog. Throughout the film, Jason has nightmares about a tragedy in his childhood. Either Jason (played as a youth by Sean Hutchinson) or Joshua (played as a youth by Burleigh Moore) killed Mad Dog, while he was drunkenedly attacking their mother. After being comforted by Lyric, he learns to deal with his past. Alonzo tells his gang and Joshua about the bank robbery plan. Lyric, eavesdropping on their conversation, tells Jason about the bank robbery.\n\nUnfortunately, the robbery does not go as planned; Joshua comes in late. Most significantly, he causes bedlam by independently terrorizing and beating the customers of the bank. He does get in the getaway car with his gang when the heist is over.  As punishment, Joshua is [[flagellation|flogged]] by the rest of his gang. Joshua returns home. Jason realizes how badly he's been beaten, so he confronts the leader of the gang, Alonzo ([[Treach]]), who is Lyric's brother. As a result of this, the two have a vicious fight in a public restroom.\n\nJason then meets Lyric at the bayou and tells her that he can't leave with her. His nightmares occur because Jason took a gun from Joshua, but accidentally shot Mad Dog in the chest instead, which is why he feels obligated to his family.\n\nThings get worse when Joshua hears his mother tell Jason to leave town with Lyric because he doesn't owe her or Joshua anything. Joshua believes that Jason is leaving not only because of Lyric, but because Alonzo may take revenge. Joshua plans to kill them all in order to keep his brother from leaving.\n\nJason hears about Joshua's plan and heads to Alonzo/Lyric's house, but he's too late. He sees that Joshua has already shot down both of Alonzo's crew members and rushes upstairs looking for Lyric. He finds that Joshua has a gun pointed at her neck. He draws a gun as well and is able to convince Joshua not to kill her. However Joshua accidentally shoots Lyric. \n\nJason carries her out of the home to a growing crowd outside the house. Lyric is injured, but still alive. Joshua is fed up with his life and decides to end it all by [[suicide|killing himself]] (off screen), in earshot of everyone outside. The film ends with Jason and Lyric riding a bus, leaving town; however, some versions do not show this part.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Allen Payne]] \u2014 Jason Alexander\n**Sean Hutchinson \u2013 Jason (age 11)\n*[[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]] \u2014 Lyric\n*[[Bokeem Woodbine]] \u2014 Joshua Alexander\n**Burleigh Moore \u2013 Joshua (age 8)\n*[[Treach|Anthony 'Treach' Criss]] \u2014 Alonzo \"A-1\"\n*[[Eddie Griffin]] \u2014 Rat \n*[[Suzzanne Douglas]] \u2014 Gloria \n*[[Lisa Nicole Carson]] \u2014 Marti\n*Lahmard Tate \u2014 Ron\n*[[Forest Whitaker]] \u2014 Maddog\n*[[Wayne Dehart]] - Street Preacher\n\n==Reception==\n''Jason's Lyric'' received generally positive reviews from movie critics.

21st centuries.  After [[World War II]] many badges were phased out of the [[United States Armed Forces]] in favor of more modern military badges which are used today.\n\nA unique obsolete badge situation occurred with [[General of the Air Force]] [[Henry H. Arnold]], who in 1913 was among the 24 Army pilots to receive the first [[U.S. Air Force Aeronautical Ratings#Military Aviator|Military Aviator Badge]], an eagle bearing [[U.S. Army Signal Corps|Signal Corps]] flags suspended from a bar.<ref name=\"Eagle\">[http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Documents/1963/1063wings.pdf The Mark of an Eagle], Air Force Magazine, by TSgt Harold L. Craven, dated October 1963, last accessed 14 October 2019</ref>  Replaced in 1917 by the more conventional \"wings\" embroidered design (authorized as an oxidized [[silver]] badge in 1921), Arnold displayed both types on his uniform throughout his career. The original Military Aviator Badge design can be seen in pictures of him in uniform.\n\nThe following is a listing of obsolete U.S. military badges and insignia organized by branch of service.\n\n==[[United States Army|U.S. Army]]==\n===[[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps|Army Aviation Section]]/[[United States Army Air Service|Air Service]]===\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa;
