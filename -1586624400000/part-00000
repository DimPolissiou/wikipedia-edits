Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurance, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]].

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. According to the historical anthropology [[Susan Bayly]] of [[University of Cambridge]] states that this is the [[Kshatriya]] of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and uppar [[India]]. Until tye 1940, kolis were considered as criminal stocks and mostly used for police and military by rulers and authorities. Some of them engaged in marketing as [[Vaishya]] and a large number engaged in agriculture and as soldier. They have gained prominence from islamic india and were political strong and petty rulers from koli community were vested the titles of [[Thakor]] and [[Girasia]] which means ''Girasdar'' or collector of tax from his territory.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite book|last=Bayly|first=Susan|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=HbAjKR_iHogC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age|date=2001-02-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79842-6|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mughal time, kolis were most notorious for rulers. so a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] chronicler mentioned that the kolis of gujarat raised against mughal rule.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurance, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis. There were no difficulties for rebels and ''Govindas Ramdas'' proclaimed himself as ruler (''Koli Thakor)'' of Thasra. <ref name=\":17\">{{Cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Vinayak|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzPlZSOjCpsC&pg=PA90&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Peasant Pasts: History and Memory in Western India|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25076-5|language=en}}</ref> he led the kolis 1826 to 1830 as a ruler.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDuring the ''Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]],'' the kolis of [[Nashik district]] in [[Maharashtra]] rebelled in the ''Petty Princely State Of [[Peint]]'' also spelled ''Penth and Peth .'' peint was a [[Jagir]]'' '' of twenty four vilages and ruled by koli king ''Bhagvant Rao'' also knowns as ''Bhargav Rav .''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Deshpande|first=Arvind M.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=79sS_w_bOQYC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Koli+Raja+Peint&source=bl&ots=Vf7J9ivfZy&sig=ACfU3U3qQfAfE5epilPBBXeDIE0DOCmSvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit3crjnt_oAhU9H7cAHd_1AcYQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Koli%20Raja%20Peint&f=false|title=John Briggs in Maharashtra: A Study of District Administration Under Early British Rule|date=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|language=en}}</ref> the rebellion was raised by it's koli chief, queen and her [[Dewan|Diwan]]'' '' in the lead of ''Bhagojee Naik and Bhow Patel Malekar'' (both koli) to collapse the british rule.

Five of the 8 records still stand over 20 years later.\n\nA few of his biggest feats, a .484 batting average, 1.8 RBIs per game (he had 90 in 50 games), and 22 HRs, including 2 Grand Slams in one inning.\n\nWhile the NCAA does not presently keep official records of [[On-base plus slugging]] (OPS), by comparison, Ross's 1.607 OPS is 13% higher than the 1.422 of [[Major League Baseball]] single season [[List of Major League Baseball record holders|OPS record]] holder [[Barry Bonds]] (set in 2004).\n\n==1985 Season Statistics==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|width=\"25\"|'''BA'''\n|width=\"25\"|'''Gms'''\n|width=\"25\"|'''AB'''\n|width=\"25\"|'''R'''\n|width=\"25\"|'''H'''\n|width=\"25\"|'''2B'''\n|width=\"25\"|'''3B'''\n|width=\"25\"|'''HR'''\n|width=\"25\"|'''RBI'''\n|width=\"25\"|'''TB'''\n|width=\"25\"|'''SLG%'''\n|width=\"25\"|'''BB'''\n|width=\"25\"|'''SO'''\n|width=\"25\"|'''OBP'''\n|width=\"25\"|'''OPS'''\n|-bgcolor=\"#FBCEB1\"\n|.484||50||186||79||90||17||3||22||90||179||.962||53||15||.645||1.607\n|-bgcolor=\"#D0F0C0\"\n|}\n\nIn the highly competitive Division II [[Sunshine State Conference]], in which Saint Leo played, Ross was the first player to win the triple crown (Batting Average, HRs, and RBIs). The Sunshine State Conference has had 14 NCAA Division II College World Series champions since 1968.\n\nRoss\u2019 performance in 1985 earned him 1st Team All-Sunshine State Conference, 1st Team All-South, and 1st Team All-American (the only unanimous choice that year).\n\nHis excellence was remarkable in that the prior season for Saint Leo he hit .313 with only 8 HRs and 38 RBIs in 59 games (he was 2nd Team All-Conference at 1st Base).  His turnaround was largely attributable to first-year Saint Leo head baseball coach and legendary [[Major League Baseball]] pitcher [[Mike Marshall (baseball pitcher)]].  Marshall trusted on Ross team captain responsibility and made numerous refinements to his batting stance and swing.\n\nAt 6\u20192\u201d and 215&nbsp;lbs. Ross was an imposing and strong figure.  Marshall, who played Major League Baseball from 1967\u201381, commented that \u201cthere was only one player stronger than Ross\u201d he had ever seen or played against; and \u201cit was [[Willie Stargell]].\u201d\n\nOf Ross\u2019 22 HRs, 16 were with men on base, 3 were leadoff solo HRs.  He hit 2 HRs in a game 3 times.  His slugging percentage was .962; his on-base percentage was .645.  He had 53 walks in 50 games.  In the 19 games in which he hit his 22 HRs, his batting average was .623 with 67 RBIs (3.5 RBI per game).\n\nHe only struck out 15 times in 248 plate appearances (an average of 6 strikeouts per 100 plate appearances).  He scored 79 times, 1.58 times per game.\n\nAs a first baseman Ross was near perfect.  The left-hander made only 6 errors in 516 total plays for a .988 fielding percentage.\n\n==2 Grand Slams in One Inning==\nOn March 18, 1985, in a home game against Division I [[Florida A&M]], Ross went 3-4, including 2 Grand Slams in the second inning, a stand up double (a lined shot off the center field fence) with the bases loaded in the 4th inning, and he reached 1st base on a fielders choice in the 1st inning.  He scored 4 times in 4 plate appearances, and had 11 RBIs.  In a measure of professionalism and an acknowledgement of the incredible accomplishment on the afternoon, Coach Marshall removed Ross from the game to a standing ovation to teammates and fans on hand after Ross fielded a grounder in the top of the 4th inning.  Ross was featured that evening on [[CNN]] Sports by anchor Jim Huber.\n\nRoss was 1 of 3 seniors on a Saint Leo team that went 22-26-2 (4-20 in Sunshine State Conference play).  The previous year Ross started at 1st base on a Saint Leo team that started 7 seniors, was ranked 5th in the nation in the final regular season Collegiate Baseball Poll, and went 46-13 (17-11 in Conference play, and 13-1 vs. Division I schools), and tied for the second most wins in the nation in Division II during the regular season.\n\nIn Ross\u2019 final game of his college career, at home versus Conference rival [[Eckerd College]], Ross hit a home run in his last at-bat. While rounding third base, in an incredible show of sportsmanship, the Eckerd players emptied the dugout and shook hands with Ross before he reached home plate.\n\nMysteriously Ross was not drafted that summer in the Major League Baseball draft and never attempted to try out for a major league club.\n\nRoss was inducted into the Sunshine State Conference Hall of Fame in the class of 1992-93. In the Conference he is #1 in career batting average, #1 in slugging percentage, and 3rd in RBIs.\n\nRoss was inducted into the Saint Leo Athletic Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\n===NCAA Division II Records===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|width=\"38\"|'''Record #'''\n|width=\"150\"|'''What '''\n|width=\"60\"|'''How Many'''\n|width=\"100\"|'''NCAA Div II Rank'''\n|width=\"200\"|'''Notes'''\n|-bgcolor=\"#FBCEB1\"\n| 1 ||2 Grand Slams in 1 inning||1 ||Tied 1st|| 1st player ever to accomplish in Div II (had been done twice before in Div 1, never in Div III at that point)\n|-bgcolor=\"#ABCDEF\"\n| 2 ||Grand Slams in 1 game||2 ||Tied 1st|| 3rd player ever in Div II to accomplish \n|-bgcolor=\"#FBCEB1\"\n| 3 ||RBIs in 1 inning||8 ||Tied 2nd|| Held the record until 1996\n|-bgcolor=\"#ABCDEF\"\n| 4 ||RBIs in 1 game||11 ||Tied 3rd|| Accomplished in only 4 plate appearances\n|-bgcolor=\"#FBCEB1\"\n| 5 ||RBIs per game||1.80 ||Tied 9th|| 90 RBIs in 50 games; Was ranked 4th after the 1985 season\n|-bgcolor=\"#ABCDEF\"\n| 6 ||RBIs season||90 ||No longer ranked|| Was 4th after the 1985 season; 11 of the Top 15 players ahead in this category played in 60 or more games, 10 or more than Ross\n|-bgcolor=\"#FBCEB1\"\n| 7 ||Slugging percentage||.962 ||No longer ranked|| Was ranked 8th after the 1985 season; of the Top 15 in this category, 14 played in less games than Ross\n|-bgcolor=\"#ABCDEF\"\n| 8 ||HRs per game average||.44 ||No longer ranked|| 22 HRs in 50 games\n|-bgcolor=\"#FBCEB1\"\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.ncaa.org/library/records/baseball/baseball_records_book/index.html NCAA baseball records book]\n*[http://www.sunshinestateconference.com/hofbios.html Sunshine State Conference biography]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ross, Phil}}\n[[Category:1962 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Saint Leo Lions baseball players]]\n[[Category:American baseball players]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the actor|Phillip Ross}} {{hangon}}\n'''Phil Ross''' (born May 23, 1962) had one of the greatest single seasons in college baseball history.

Marshall, who played Major League Baseball from 1967\u201381, commented that \u201cthere was only one player stronger than Ross\u201d he had ever seen or played against; and \u201cit was [[Willie Stargell]].\u201d\n\nOf Ross\u2019 22 HRs, 16 were with men on base, 3 were leadoff solo HRs.  He hit 2 HRs in a game 3 times.  His slugging percentage was .962; his on-base percentage was .645.  He had 53 walks in 50 games.  In the 19 games in which he hit his 22 HRs, his batting average was .623 with 67 RBIs (3.5 RBI per game).\n\nHe only struck out 15 times in 248 plate appearances (an average of 6 strikeouts per 100 plate appearances).  He scored 79 times, 1.58 times per game.\n\nAs a first baseman Ross was near perfect.  The left-hander made only 6 errors in 516 total plays for a .988 fielding percentage.\n\n==2 Grand Slams in One Inning==\nOn March 18, 1985, in a home game against Division I [[Florida A&M]], Ross went 3-4, including 2 Grand Slams in the second inning, a stand up double (a lined shot off the center field fence) with the bases loaded in the 4th inning, and he reached 1st base on a fielders choice in the 1st inning.  He scored 4 times in 4 plate appearances, and had 11 RBIs.  In a measure of professionalism and an acknowledgement of the incredible accomplishment on the afternoon, Coach Marshall removed Ross from the game to a standing ovation to teammates and fans on hand after Ross fielded a grounder in the top of the 4th inning.  Ross was featured that evening on [[CNN]] Sports by anchor Jim Huber.\n\nRoss was 1 of 3 seniors on a Saint Leo team that went 22-26-2 (4-20 in Sunshine State Conference play).  The previous year Ross started at 1st base on a Saint Leo team that started 7 seniors, was ranked 5th in the nation in the final regular season Collegiate Baseball Poll, and went 46-13 (17-11 in Conference play, and 13-1 vs. Division I schools), and tied for the second most wins in the nation in Division II during the regular season.\n\nIn Ross\u2019 final game of his college career, at home versus Conference rival [[Eckerd College]], Ross hit a home run in his last at-bat. While rounding third base, in an incredible show of sportsmanship, the Eckerd players emptied the dugout and shook hands with Ross before he reached home plate.\n\nMysteriously Ross was not drafted that summer in the Major League Baseball draft and never attempted to try out for a major league club.\n\nRoss was inducted into the Sunshine State Conference Hall of Fame in the class of 1992-93. In the Conference he is #1 in career batting average, #1 in slugging percentage, and 3rd in RBIs.\n\nRoss was inducted into the Saint Leo Athletic Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\n===NCAA Division II Records===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|width=\"38\"|'''Record #'''\n|width=\"150\"|'''What '''\n|width=\"60\"|'''How Many'''\n|width=\"100\"|'''NCAA Div II Rank'''\n|width=\"200\"|'''Notes'''\n|-bgcolor=\"#FBCEB1\"\n| 1 ||2 Grand Slams in 1 inning||1 ||Tied 1st|| 1st player ever to accomplish in Div II (had been done twice before in Div 1, never in Div III at that point)\n|-bgcolor=\"#ABCDEF\"\n| 2 ||Grand Slams in 1 game||2 ||Tied 1st|| 3rd player ever in Div II to accomplish \n|-bgcolor=\"#FBCEB1\"\n| 3 ||RBIs in 1 inning||8 ||Tied 2nd|| Held the record until 1996\n|-bgcolor=\"#ABCDEF\"\n| 4 ||RBIs in 1 game||11 ||Tied 3rd|| Accomplished in only 4 plate appearances\n|-bgcolor=\"#FBCEB1\"\n| 5 ||RBIs per game||1.80 ||Tied 9th|| 90 RBIs in 50 games; Was ranked 4th after the 1985 season\n|-bgcolor=\"#ABCDEF\"\n| 6 ||RBIs season||90 ||No longer ranked|| Was 4th after the 1985 season; 11 of the Top 15 players ahead in this category played in 60 or more games, 10 or more than Ross\n|-bgcolor=\"#FBCEB1\"\n| 7 ||Slugging percentage||.962 ||No longer ranked|| Was ranked 8th after the 1985 season; of the Top 15 in this category, 14 played in less games than Ross\n|-bgcolor=\"#ABCDEF\"\n| 8 ||HRs per game average||.44 ||No longer ranked|| 22 HRs in 50 games\n|-bgcolor=\"#FBCEB1\"\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.ncaa.org/library/records/baseball/baseball_records_book/index.html NCAA baseball records book]\n*[http://www.sunshinestateconference.com/hofbios.html Sunshine State Conference biography]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ross, Phil}}\n[[Category:1962 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Saint Leo Lions baseball players]]\n[[Category:American baseball players]]\n", "name_user": "EurekaLott", "label": "safe", "comment": "no deletion proposal was made; no need for {{hangon}}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Ross"}

{"title_page": "History of the Panama Canal", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:Wikipediacanal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Large ship coming through a canal lock|Miraflores Locks in 2004]]\nThe idea of the [[Panama canal]] dates back to 1513, when [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] first crossed [[Isthmus of Panama|the isthmus]]. The narrow land bridge between [[North America|North]] and South America houses the Panama Canal, a water passage between the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Oceans. The earliest European colonists recognized this potential, and several proposals for a [[canal]] were made.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Lydia|title=Panama Canal 100th Anniversary|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/panama-canal-100th-anniversary-history-facts-about-one-seven-wonders-modern-world-1461183|website=International Business Times|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, technological advances and commercial pressure allowed construction to begin in earnest. Noted canal engineer [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] led an initial attempt by France to build a [[sea-level]] canal.  Beset by cost overruns due to the severe underestimation of the difficulties in excavating the rugged Panama land, heavy personnel losses in Panama due to [[tropical diseases]], and [[Panama scandals|political corruption in France]] surrounding the financing of the massive project, the project succeeded in only partially completing the canal.\n\nInterest in a U.S.-led canal effort picked up as soon as France abandoned the project.  Initially, the Panama site was politically unfavorable in the U.S. for a variety of reasons, including the taint of the failed French efforts and the [[Colombia]]n government's unfriendly attitude towards the U.S. continuing the project.  The U.S. first sought to construct a [[History of the Nicaragua Canal|completely new canal]] through [[Nicaragua]] instead.\n\nFrench engineer and financier [[Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla]] played a key role in changing U.S. attitudes.  Bunau-Varilla had a large stake in the failed French canal company, and stood to make money on his investment only if the Panama Canal was completed.  Extensive [[lobbying]] of U.S. lawmakers coupled with his support of a nascent independence movement among the Panamanian people led to a simultaneous revolution in Panama and the negotiation of the [[Hay\u2013Bunau-Varilla Treaty]] which secured both independence for Panama and the right for the U.S. to lead a renewed effort to construct the canal.  Colombia's response to the Panamanian independence movement was tempered by U.S. military presence; the move is often cited as a classic example of the era of [[gunboat diplomacy]].\n\nU.S. success hinged on two factors.  First was converting the original French sea-level plan to a more realistic [[Lock (water navigation)|lock]]-controlled canal.  The second was controlling disease which decimated workers and management alike under the original French attempt.  Initial chief engineer [[John Frank Stevens]] built much of the infrastructure necessary for later construction; slow progress on the canal itself led to his replacement by [[George Washington Goethals]].  Goethals oversaw the bulk of the excavation of the canal, including appointing Major [[David du Bose Gaillard]] to oversee the most daunting project, the [[Culebra Cut]] through the roughest terrain on the route.  Almost as important as the engineering advances was the healthcare advances made during the construction, led by [[William C. Gorgas]], an expert in controlling tropical diseases such as [[yellow fever]] and [[malaria]].  Gorgas was one of the first to recognize the role of [[mosquito]]es in the spread of these diseases, and by focusing on controlling the mosquitoes greatly improved worker conditions.\n\nOn 7 January 1914 the French crane boat ''Alexandre La Valley'' became the first to make the traverse, and on 1 April 1914 the construction was officially completed with the hand-over of the project from the construction company to the Canal Zone government.  The outbreak of World War I caused the cancellation of any official \"grand opening\" celebration, and the canal officially opened to commercial traffic on 15 August 1914 with the transit of the ''[[SS Ancon (1901)|SS Ancon]]''.\n\nDuring World War II, the canal proved a vital part of the U.S. military strategy, allowing ships to transfer easily between the Atlantic and Pacific.  Politically, the Canal remained a territory of the United States until 1977, when the [[Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties]] began the process of transferring territorial control of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to Panama, a process completed on 31 December 1999.\n\nThe Panama Canal continues to be a viable commercial venture and a vital link in world shipping, and continues to be periodically updated and maintained.  The [[Panama Canal expansion project]] started construction in 2007 and began commercial operation on 26 June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger [[Post-Panamax]] and [[New Panamax]] ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the original locks could accommodate.<ref name=NYT062016/>\n\n=={{anchor|The French project}}French project==\n[[File:Kanal MK1888.png|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=See caption|1888 German map of a projected Panama Canal (above) and an alternate Nicaragua route (below)]]\nThe idea of a canal across Central America was revived during the early 19th century. In 1819, the Spanish government authorized the construction of a canal and the creation of a company to build it.\n\nAlthough the project stalled for some time, a number of surveys were made between 1850 and 1875. They indicated that the two most-favorable routes were across Panama (then part of Colombia) and [[Nicaragua canal|Nicaragua]], with a third route across the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] in Mexico another option. The Nicaraguan route was surveyed.\n\n===Conception===\n[[File:Panama-Canal 1880.JPG|thumb|Part de Fondateur of the Compagnie Universelle du Canal Interoc\u00e9anique de Panama, issued 29. November 1880]]\nAfter the 1869 completion of the [[Suez Canal]], France thought that an apparently similar project to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans could be carried out with little difficulty. In 1876 an international company, La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 internationale du Canal interoc\u00e9anique, was created to undertake its construction; two years later, it obtained a [[Concession (contract)|concession]] from the Colombian government (since Panama was a Colombian province) to dig a canal across the isthmus.\n\n[[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], who was in charge of the Suez Canal construction, headed the project. His enthusiastic leadership and his reputation as the man who had built the Suez Canal persuaded speculators and ordinary citizens to invest nearly $400&nbsp;million in the project.\n\nHowever, despite his previous success de Lesseps was not an engineer. The Suez Canal, essentially a ditch dug through a flat, sandy desert, presented few challenges. Although Central America's mountainous spine has a low point in Panama, it is still {{convert|110|m|ft|1|sp=us}} above sea level at its lowest crossing point. The sea-level canal proposed by de Lesseps would require a great deal of excavation through a variety of rock, rather than Suez' sand.\n\nLess-obvious barriers were the rivers crossing the canal, particularly the [[Chagres River|Chagres]] (which flows strongly during the rainy season). Since the water would be a hazard to shipping if it drained into the canal, a sea-level canal would require the river's diversion.\n\nThe most serious problem was [[tropical disease]], particularly [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]], whose methods of transmission were unknown at the time. The legs of hospital beds were placed in cans of water to keep insects from crawling up them, but the stagnant water was an ideal breeding place for mosquitoes (carriers of the diseases).\n\nThe project was plagued by a lack of engineering expertise. In May 1879, an international engineering congress led by de Lesseps convened in Paris. Of its 136 delegates, only 42 were engineers; the others were speculators, politicians and friends of de Lesseps.\n\nHe was convinced that a sea-level canal, dug through the mountainous spine of Central America, could be completed at least as easily as the Suez Canal. The engineering congress estimated the project's cost at $214 million; on February 14, 1880, an engineering commission revised the estimate to $168.6 million. De Lesseps reduced this estimate twice, with no apparent justification: on February 20 to $131.6 million and on March 1 to $120 million. The congress estimated seven or eight years as the time required to complete the canal; de Lesseps reduced this estimate to six years (the Suez Canal required ten).\n\nThe proposed sea-level canal would have a uniform depth of {{convert|9|m|ft|1|sp=us}}, a bottom width of {{convert|22|m|ft|1|sp=us}} and a width at water level of about {{convert|27.5|m|ft|1|sp=us}}; the excavation estimate was {{convert|120000000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. A dam was proposed at [[Gamboa, Panama|Gamboa]] to control flooding of the Chagres River, with channels to drain water away from the canal. However, the Gamboa dam was later found impracticable and the Chagres River problem was left unsolved.\n\n==={{anchor|Construction begins}}Construction===\n[[File:The Panama Canal -- The Great Culebra Cut.jpg|thumb|left|250px|alt=Illustration of a large, terraced excavation|The Culebra Cut in 1885]]\nConstruction of the canal began on January 1, 1881, with digging at [[Culebra Cut|Culebra]] beginning on January 22.{{ref|earthinfo2}} A large labor force was assembled, numbering about 40,000 in 1888 (nine-tenths of whom were [[French Caribbean|afro-Caribbean]] workers from the [[West Indies]]). Although the project attracted good, well-paid French engineers, retaining them was difficult due to disease. The death toll from 1881 to 1889 was estimated at over 22,000, of whom as many as 5,000 were French citizens.<ref>The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870\u20131914, David McCullough, Simon & Schuster, 1978 (a comprehensive history of the building of the canal)</ref>\n\nBy 1885 it had become clear to many that a sea-level canal was impractical, and an elevated canal with locks was preferable; de Lesseps resisted, and a lock canal plan was not adopted until October 1887. By this time increasing mortality rates, as well as financial and engineering problems coupled with frequent [[flood]]s and [[mudslide]]s, indicated that the project was in serious trouble. Work continued under the new plan until May 15, 1889, when the company went bankrupt and the project was suspended. After eight years the canal was about two-fifths completed, and about $234.8 million had been spent.\n\n[[File:CanalPanama.gif|thumb|alt=Photo of the canal's construction|Construction of the canal]]\nThe company's collapse was a [[Panama scandals|scandal in France]], and the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] [[Edouard Drumont]] exploited the role of two Jewish [[speculator]]s in the affair. One hundred and four legislators were found to have been involved in the corruption, and [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] was commissioned by the French parliament to conduct an inquiry which was completed in 1893.{{ref|panscandal}}\n\n==={{anchor|New French Canal Company}}New Panama Canal Company===\nIt soon became clear that the only way to recoup expenses for the stockholders was to continue the project. A new concession was obtained from Colombia, and in 1894 the Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama was created to finish the canal. To comply with the terms of the contract, work began immediately on the Culebra excavation while a team of engineers began a comprehensive study of the project. They eventually settled on a plan for a two-level, lock-based canal.\n\nThe new effort never gained traction, mainly because of US speculation that a canal through Nicaragua would render one through Panama useless. The most men employed on the new project was 3,600 (in 1896), primarily to comply with the terms of the concession and to maintain the existing excavation and equipment in saleable condition. The company had already begun looking for a buyer, with an asking price of $109 million.\n\nIn the US, a congressional [[Isthmian Canal Commission of 1899|Isthmian Canal Commission]] was established in 1899 to examine possibilities for a Central American canal and recommend a route. In November 1901, the commission reported that a US canal should be built through Nicaragua unless the French were willing to sell their holdings for $40 million. The recommendation became law on June 28, 1902, and the New Panama Canal Company was compelled to sell at that price.{{ref|french}}\n\n==={{anchor|The French achievement}}Results===\nAlthough the French effort was, to a large extent, doomed to failure from the beginning due to disease and a lack of understanding of the engineering difficulties, it was not entirely futile. The old and new companies excavated {{convert|59747638|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of material, of which {{convert|14255890|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} was taken from the [[Culebra Cut]]. The old company dredged a channel from [[Panama Bay]] to the port at [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]], and the channel dredged on the Atlantic side (known as the French canal) was useful for bringing in sand and stone for the locks and spillway concrete at [[Gat\u00fan]].\n\nDetailed surveys and studies (particularly those carried out by the new canal company) and machinery, including railroad equipment and vehicles, aided the later American effort. The French lowered the summit of the Culebra Cut along the canal route by five meters (17&nbsp;ft), from {{convert|64|to|59|m}}. An estimated {{convert|22713396|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of excavation, valued at about $25.4 million, and equipment and surveys valued at about $17.4 million were usable by the Americans.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n=={{anchor|Nicaragua}}Nicaraguan canal==\n{{Main|Nicaragua Canal}}\n\nThe 1848 [[California Gold Rush|discovery of gold in California]] and the rush of would-be miners stimulated US interest in building a canal between the oceans. In 1887, a [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] regiment surveyed canal possibilities in Nicaragua. Two years later, the Maritime Canal Company was asked to begin a canal in the area and chose Nicaragua. The company lost money in the [[panic of 1893]], and its work in Nicaragua ceased. In 1897 and 1899, the [[United States Congress]] charged a canal commission with researching possible construction; Nicaragua was chosen as the location both times.\n\nAlthough the Nicaraguan canal proposal was made redundant by the American takeover of the French Panama Canal project, increases in shipping volume and ship sizes have revived interest in the project. A canal across Nicaragua accommodating post-[[Panamax]] ships or a rail link carrying containers between ports on either coast have been proposed.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n=={{anchor|The United States and the canal}}United States==\n{{See also|Panama\u2013Colombia separation|Gunboat diplomacy}}\n\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] believed that a US-controlled canal across Central America was a vital strategic interest of the country. This idea gained wide circulation after the destruction of the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|USS ''Maine'']] in [[Cuba]] on February 15, 1898. Reversing a Walker Commission decision in favor of a Nicaraguan canal, Roosevelt encouraged the acquisition of the French Panama Canal effort. [[George S. Morison (engineer)|George S. Morison]] was the only commission member who argued for the Panama location. The purchase of the French-held land for $40&nbsp;million was authorized by the June 28, 1902 [[Spooner Act]]. Since Panama was then part of [[Colombia]], Roosevelt began negotiating with that country to obtain the necessary rights. In early 1903 the [[Hay\u2013Herr\u00e1n Treaty]] was signed by both nations, but the [[Senate of Colombia]] failed to ratify the treaty.\n\nRoosevelt implied to Panamanian rebels that if they revolted, the US Navy would assist their fight for independence. Panama declared its independence on November 3, 1903, and the [[USS Nashville (PG-7)|USS ''Nashville'']] impeded Colombian interference. The victorious Panamanians gave the United States control of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] on February 23, 1904, for $10&nbsp;million in accordance with the November 18, 1903 [[Hay\u2013Bunau-Varilla Treaty]].\n\n==={{anchor|The takeover|Making sense of the task|Setting the course}}Takeover===\n[[File:Panama-canal-shepherd-map.png|400px|thumb|right|alt=See caption|1923 elevation map of the canal, showing the region's topography]]\nThe United States took control of the French property connected to the canal on May 4, 1904, when Lieutenant Jatara Oneel of the United States Army was presented with the keys during a small ceremony.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The new Panama Canal Zone Control was overseen by the [[Isthmian Canal Commission]] (ICC) during construction.\n\nThe first step taken by the US government was to place all the canal workers under the new administration. The operation was maintained at minimum strength to comply with the canal concession and keep the machinery in working order. The US inherited a small workforce and an assortment of buildings, infrastructure and equipment, much of which had been neglected for fifteen years in the humid jungle environment. There were no facilities in place for a large workforce, and the infrastructure was crumbling.\n\nCataloguing assets was a large job; it took many weeks to card-index available equipment. About 2,150 buildings had been acquired,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=M6JAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA2598&lpg=PA2598&dq=2148+buildings+panama+canal#v=onepage&q=2148%20buildings%20panama%20canal&f=false |title = Annual Report of the Chief of Engineers, United States Army|year = 1916}}</ref> many of which were uninhabitable; housing was an early problem, and the [[Panama Canal Railway|Panama Railway]] was in a state of decay. However, much equipment (such as locomotives, dredges<ref>French Belgian Built Ladder Dredge - http://www.czimages.com/CZMemories/ladderdredge/ladderdredge1.htm  accessed 7/19/2018</ref> and other floating equipment) was still serviceable.\n\n[[File:George W. Goethals cph.3a02121.jpg|thumb|160px|General [[George Washington Goethals]]]]\nAlthough chief engineer [[John Findley Wallace]] was pressured to resume construction, [[red tape]] from Washington stifled his efforts to obtain heavy equipment and caused friction between Wallace and the ICC. He and chief sanitary officer [[William C. Gorgas]] were frustrated by delay, and Wallace resigned in 1905. He was replaced by [[John Frank Stevens]], who arrived on July 26, 1905. Stevens quickly realized that serious investment in infrastructure was necessary and determined to upgrade the railway, improve sanitation in [[Panama City]] and [[Col\u00f3n, Panama|Col\u00f3n]], renovate the old French buildings and build hundreds of new ones for housing. He then began the difficult task of recruiting the large labor force required for construction. Stevens' approach was to press ahead first and obtain approval later. He improved drilling and dirt-removal equipment at the Culebra Cut for greater efficiency, revising the inadequate provisions in place for soil disposal.\n\nNo decision had been made about whether the canal should be a [[Lock (canal)|lock]] or a sea-level one; the ongoing excavation would be useful in either case. In late 1905, President Roosevelt sent a team of engineers to Panama to investigate the relative merits of both types in cost and time. Although the engineers voted eight to five in favor of a sea-level canal, Stevens and the ICC opposed the plan; Stevens' report to Roosevelt was instrumental in convincing the president of the merits of a lock canal and Congress concurred. In November 1906 Roosevelt visited Panama to inspect the canal's progress, the first trip outside the United States by a sitting president.\n\nWhether contract employees or government workers would build the canal was controversial. Bids for the canal's construction were opened in January 1907, and [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]-based contractor [[William J. Oliver (industrialist)|William J. Oliver]] was the low bidder.  Stevens disliked Oliver, and vehemently opposed his choice. Although Roosevelt initially favored the use of a contractor, he eventually decided that army engineers should carry out the work{{ref|DuVal}} and appointed Major [[George Washington Goethals]] as chief engineer (under Stevens' direction) in February 1907. Stevens, frustrated by government inaction and the army involvement, resigned and was replaced by Goethals.{{ref|Mellander}}\n\n==={{anchor|The workforce}}Workforce===\nThe US relied on a stratified workforce to build the canal. High-level engineering jobs, clerical positions, skilled labor and jobs in supporting industries were generally reserved for white Americans, with manual labor primarily by cheap immigrant labor. These jobs were initially filled by Europeans, primarily from Spain, Italy and Greece, many of whom were radical and militant due to political turmoil in Europe. The US then decided to recruit primarily from the British and French West Indies, and these workers provided most of the manual labor on the canal.{{ref|Zieger}}\n\n==={{anchor|Dealing with disease}}Living conditions===\n{{Main|Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal}}\nThe Canal Zone originally had minimal facilities for entertainment and relaxation for the canal workers apart from saloons; as a result, alcohol abuse was a great problem. The inhospitable conditions resulted in many American workers returning home each year.\n\nA program of improvements was implemented. Clubhouses were built, managed by the [[YMCA]], with billiard, assembly and reading rooms, bowling alleys, darkrooms for camera clubs, [[gymnastic]] equipment, ice cream parlors, soda fountains and a [[circulating library]]. Member dues were ten dollars a year, with the remaining upkeep (about $7,000 at the larger clubhouses) paid by the ICC. The commission built baseball fields and arranged rail transportation to games; a competitive league soon developed. Semimonthly Saturday-night dances were held at the Hotel Tivoli, which had a spacious ballroom.\n\nThese measures influenced life in the Canal Zone; alcohol abuse fell, with saloon business declining by 60 percent.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The number of workers leaving the project each year dropped significantly.\n\n==={{anchor|Construction in earnest}}US construction===\n[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|200px|thumb|right|alt=Large excavation through mountains, seen from a rail tunnel|Culebra Cut in 1907]]\nThe work done thus far was preparation, rather than construction. By the time Goethals took over, the construction infrastructure had been created or overhauled and expanded from the French effort and he was soon able to begin construction in earnest.\n\nGoethals divided the project into three divisions: Atlantic, Central and Pacific. The Atlantic Division, under Major [[William L. Sibert]], was responsible for construction of the [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] at the entrance to [[Limon Bay]], the [[Gat\u00fan]] locks and their {{convert|5.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} approach channel, and the [[Gatun Dam]]. The Pacific Division (under Sydney B. Williamson, the only civilian division head) was responsible for the Pacific entrance to the canal, including a {{convert|4.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} breakwater in Panama Bay, the approach channel, and the [[Miraflores (Panama)|Miraflores]] and Pedro Miguel locks and their associated dams. The Central Division, under Major [[David du Bose Gaillard]], was responsible for everything in between. It had arguably the project's greatest challenge: excavating the [[Culebra Cut]] (known as the Gaillard Cut from 1915 to 2000), which involved cutting {{convert|8|mi|km}} through the [[continental divide]] down to 12 meters (40&nbsp;ft) above sea level.\n\nBy August 1907, 765,000 m\u00b3 (1,000,000 cubic yards) per month was being excavated; this set a record for the rainy season; soon afterwards this doubled, before increasing again. At the peak of production, 2,300,000 m\u00b3 (3,000,000 cubic yards) were being excavated per month (the equivalent of digging a [[Channel Tunnel]] every 3\u00bd months).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==={{anchor|The Culebra Cut (Gaillard Cut)}}Culebra Cut===\n{{main|Culebra Cut}}\n[[File:Panama-canal-shepherd-elevation.png|thumb|upright=1.75|alt=See caption|1923 diagram illustrating the elevations through which the canal cuts across the isthmus]]\n\nOne of the greatest barriers to a canal was the [[continental divide]], which originally rose to {{convert|110|m|ft|1}} above sea level at its highest point. The effort to cut through this barrier of rock was one of the greatest challenges faced by the project.\n\nGoethals arrived at the canal with Major [[David du Bose Gaillard]] of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Gaillard was placed in charge of the canal's Central Division, which stretched from the Pedro Miguel locks to the [[Gatun Dam]], and dedicated himself to getting the Culebra Cut (as it was then known) excavated.\n\nThe scale of the work was massive. Six thousand men worked in the cut, drilling holes in which a total of {{convert|27000|t|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of [[dynamite]] were placed to break up the rock (which was then removed by as many as 160 trains per day). Landslides were frequent, due to the [[oxidation]] and weakening of the rock's underlying iron [[stratum|strata]]. Although the scale of the job and the frequent, unpredictable slides generated chaos, Gaillard provided quiet, clear-sighted leadership.\n\nOn May 20, 1913, [[Bucyrus-Erie|Bucyrus]] steam shovels made a passage through the Culebra Cut at the level of the canal bottom. The French effort had reduced the summit to  {{convert|59|m|ft|1}} over a relatively narrow width; the Americans had lowered this to  {{convert|12|m|ft|1}} above sea level over a greater width, and had excavated over {{convert|76000000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of material. About {{convert|23000000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of this material in addition to the planned excavation, in the form of landslides. Dry excavation ended on September 10, 1913; a January slide had added {{convert|1500000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} of earth, but it was decided that this loose material would be removed by dredging when the cut was flooded.\n\n==={{anchor|The dams}}Dams===\nTwo [[lake#Artificial lakes|artificial lakes]] are key parts of the canal: [[Gatun Lake|Gatun]] and Miraflores Lakes. Four dams were constructed to create them. Two small dams at Miraflores impound Miraflores Lake, and a dam at Pedro Miguel encloses the south end of the [[Culebra Cut]] (essentially an arm of Lake Gatun). The [[Gatun Dam]] is the main dam blocking the original course of the [[Chagres River]], creating Gatun Lake.\n\nThe Miraflores dams are an {{convert|825|m|ft|0|adj=on}} earth dam connecting the Miraflores Locks in the west and a {{convert|150|m|ft|0|adj=on}} concrete spillway dam east of the locks. The concrete dam has eight [[floodgate]]s, similar to those on the Gatun [[spillway]]. The earthen, {{convert|430|m|ft|0|adj=on}} Pedro Miguel dam extends from a hill in the west to the lock. Its face is protected by rock [[riprap]] at the water level. The largest and most challenging of the dams is the Gatun Dam. This [[earthen dam]], {{convert|640|m|ft|0}} thick at the base and {{convert|2300|m|ft|0}} long along the top, was the largest of its kind in the world when the canal opened.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==={{anchor|The locks}}Locks===\n[[File:PedroMiguelLocks1913Color.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Concrete wall and rail line|Pedro Miguel Locks under construction during the early 1910s, looking north, showing the center wall and intakes]]\n{{Main|Panama Canal locks}}\n\nThe original lock canal plan called for a two-step set of locks at Sosa Hill and a long Sosa Lake extending to Pedro Miguel.<ref>Panama Canal Official Site - History - https://www.pancanal.com/eng/history/history/ select chapter Locks Design - accessed 7/19/2018</ref>   In late 1907, it was decided to move the Sosa Hill locks further inland to Miraflores, mostly because the new site provided a more stable construction foundation. The resulting small lake Miraflores became a fresh water supply for Panama City.\n\nBuilding the locks began with the first concrete laid at Gatun on August 24, 1909. The Gatun locks are built into a cutting into a hill bordering the lake, requiring the excavation of {{convert|3800000|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of material (mostly rock). The locks were made of {{convert|1564400|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of concrete, with an extensive system of electric railways and [[aerial lift]]s transporting concrete to the lock-construction sites.\n\nThe Pacific-side locks were finished first: the single flight at Pedro Miguel in 1911, and Miraflores in May 1913. The seagoing [[tugboat]] ''Gatun'', an Atlantic-entrance tug used to haul barges, traversed the Gatun locks on September 26, 1913. The trip was successful, although the valves were controlled manually; the central control board was not yet ready.\n\n===Opening===\nOn October 10, 1913, the dike at Gamboa which had kept the Culebra Cut isolated from Gatun Lake was demolished; the detonation was made telegraphically by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in Washington. On January 7, 1914, the ''Alexandre La Valley'',<ref>Official Site Panama Canal - History - https://www.pancanal.com/eng/history/history/  select chapter END OF THE CONSTRUCTION - accessed 7/19/2018</ref> an old French crane boat, became the first ship to make a complete transit of the Panama Canal under its own steam after working its way across during the final stages of construction.\n\nAs construction wound down, the canal team began to disperse. Thousands of workers were laid off, and entire towns were disassembled or demolished. Chief sanitary officer [[William C. Gorgas]], who left to fight pneumonia in the South African gold mines, became surgeon general of the Army. On April 1, 1914 the Isthmian Canal Commission disbanded, and the zone was governed by a Canal Zone Governor; the first governor was [[George Washington Goethals]].\n\nAlthough a large celebration was planned for the canal's opening, the outbreak of [[World War I]] forced the cancellation of the main festivities and it became a modest local affair. The Panama Railway steamship {{SS|Ancon|1901|6}}, piloted by Captain John A. Constantine (the canal's first [[Maritime pilot|pilot]]), made the first official transit on August 15, 1914. With no international dignitaries in attendance, Goethals followed the ''Ancon''{{'s}} progress by railroad.\n\n==={{anchor|Taking stock of the project}}Summary===\n[[File:Panama canal image.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Aerial photo through small clouds|[[International Space Station]] photo showing ''(right to left)'' the Miraflores locks, Miraflores Lake, the Pedro Miguel locks and the [[Centennial Bridge, Panama|Centennial Bridge]]]]\nThe canal was a technological marvel and an important strategic and economic asset to the US. It changed world shipping patterns, removing the need for ships to navigate the [[Drake Passage]] and [[Cape Horn]]. The canal saves a total of about {{convert|7800|mi|km}} on a sea trip from New York to San Francisco.\n\nIts anticipated military significance of the canal was proven during [[World War II]], when the canal helped restore the devastated [[United States Pacific Fleet]].{{ref|Major}} Some of the largest ships the United States had to send through the canal were [[aircraft carrier]]s, particularly [[Essex class aircraft carrier|''Essex'' class]]; they were so large that although the locks could accommodate them, the lampposts along the canal had to be removed.\n\nThe Panama Canal cost the United States about $375 million, including $10 million paid to Panama and $40 million paid to the French company. Although it was the most expensive construction project in US history to that time, it cost about $23 million less than the 1907 estimate despite landslides and an increase in the canal's width. An additional $12 million was spent on fortifications.\n\n[[File:Missouri panama canal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=The USS Missouri fitting tightly in a canal lock|''[[USS Missouri (BB-63)|Missouri]]'' traverses the Panama Canal en route to the United States in October 1945]]\nA total of over 75,000 people worked on the project; at the peak of construction, there were 40,000 workers.

However, [[William Howard Taft]] may have given the canal its greatest impetus for the longest time. Taft visited Panama five times as Roosevelt's secretary of war and twice as president. He hired John Stevens and later recommended Goethals as Stevens' replacement. Taft became president in 1909, when the canal was half finished, and was in office for most of the remainder of the work. However, Goethals later wrote: \"The real builder of the Panama Canal was Theodore Roosevelt\".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe following words by Roosevelt are displayed in the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] of the canal's administration building in [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]]:{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n<blockquote>It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.</blockquote>\n\nDavid du Bose Gaillard died of a [[brain tumor]] in [[Baltimore]] on December 5, 1913, at age 54. Promoted to colonel only a month earlier, Gaillard never saw the opening of the canal whose creation he directed. The Culebra Cut (as it was originally known) was renamed the Gaillard Cut on April 27, 1915, in his honor. A plaque commemorating Gaillard's work stood over the cut for many years; in 1998 it was moved to the administration building, near a memorial to Goethals.\n\n=={{anchor|The Third Locks Scheme (1939)}}Third-lane plans==<!-- This section is linked from [[Panama Canal]] -->\n\nIn the [[Treaty of the Danish West Indies]], the United States purchased the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]] in 1917 in part to defend the Panama Canal.<ref name=jones2016>{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Halbert |title=Governing the North American Arctic: Sovereignty, Security, and Institutions |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1137493910 |pages=107\u2013116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLPtCwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&vq=mindanao&pg=PA107#v=onepage&q=egan&f=true}}</ref> As the situation in Europe deteriorated during the late 1930s, the US again became concerned about its ability to move warships between the oceans.

A special engineering section was created on July 3, 1937, to carry out the study.\nThe section reported to Congress on February 24, 1939, recommending work to protect the existing locks and the construction of a new set of locks capable of carrying larger vessels than the existing locks could accommodate. On August 11, Congress authorized the work.\n\nThree new locks were planned, at Gat\u00fan, Pedro Miguel and Miraflores, parallel to the existing locks with new approach channels.

They would be {{convert|1/2|mi|m|0|abbr=on}} east of the existing Gat\u00fan locks and {{convert|1/4|mi|m|0|abbr=on}} west of the Pedro Miguel and Miraflores locks.\n\nThe first excavations for the new approach channels at Miraflores began on July 1, 1940, following the passage by Congress of an [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations bill]] on June 24, 1940. The first dry excavation at Gat\u00fan began on February 19, 1941. Considerable material was excavated before the project was abandoned, and the approach channels can still be seen paralleling the original channels at Gat\u00fan and Miraflores.\n\nIn 2006, the Autoridad del Canal de Panam\u00e1 (the [[Panama Canal Authority]], or ACP) proposed a plan creating a [[Panama Canal expansion project|third lane of locks]] using part of the abandoned 1940s approach canals. Following a [[referendum]], work began in 2007 and the expanded canal began commercial operations on June 26, 2016. After a two-year delay, the new locks allow the transit of [[Panamax]] ships (which have a greater cargo capacity than the original locks can handle). The first ship to cross the canal through the third set of locks was a Panamax [[container ship]], the Chinese-owned ''Cosco Shipping Panama''. The cost of the expansion was estimated at $5.25 billion.<ref name=NYT062016>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/06/26/world/americas/ap-lt-panama-canal-expansion.html?ref=world&_r=0 | title=Panama Canal Opens $5B Locks, Bullish Despite Shipping Woes | author=The Associated Press | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=2016-06-26 | accessdate=2016-06-26| author-link=The Associated Press }}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Canal handover}}Transfer to Panama==\n{{listen\n|filename=Statement on the Panama Canal Treaty Signing (September 7, 1977) Jimmy Carter.ogv\n|title=Statement on the Panama Canal treaty signing\n|description=Jimmy Carter's speech upon signing the Panama Canal treaty, September 7, 1977\n|filename2=Carter Panama Canal speech.ogg\n|title2=Statement on the Panama Canal treaty signing\n|description2=Audio-only version\n}}\n{{Further|Presidency of Jimmy Carter#Turning over the canal to Panama}}\nAfter construction, the canal and the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] surrounding it were administered by the United States. On September 7, 1977, US President [[Jimmy Carter]] signed the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties|Torrijos-Carter Treaty]] setting in motion the process of transferring control of the canal to Panama. The treaty became effective on October 1, 1979, providing for a 20-year period in which Panama would have increasing responsibility for canal operations before complete US withdrawal on December 31, 1999. Since then, the canal has been administered by the [[Panama Canal Authority]] (Autoridad de Canal de Panama, or ACP).\n\nThe transfer of the canal came under heavy attack from conservatives, especially the American Conservative Union, the Conservative Caucus, the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress, Citizens for the Republic, the American Security Council, the Young Republicans, the National Conservative Political Action Committee, the Council for National Defense, Young Americans for Freedom, the Council for Inter-American Security, and the Campus Republican Action Organization.

The narrow land bridge between [[North America|North]] and South America houses the Panama Canal, a water passage between the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Oceans. The earliest European colonists recognized this potential, and several proposals for a [[canal]] were made.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Lydia|title=Panama Canal 100th Anniversary|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/panama-canal-100th-anniversary-history-facts-about-one-seven-wonders-modern-world-1461183|website=International Business Times|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, technological advances and commercial pressure allowed construction to begin in earnest. Noted canal engineer [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] led an initial attempt by France to build a [[sea-level]] canal.  Beset by cost overruns due to the severe underestimation of the difficulties in excavating the rugged Panama land, heavy personnel losses in Panama due to [[tropical diseases]], and [[Panama scandals|political corruption in France]] surrounding the financing of the massive project, the project succeeded in only partially completing the canal.\n\nInterest in a U.S.-led canal effort picked up as soon as France abandoned the project.  Initially, the Panama site was politically unfavorable in the U.S. for a variety of reasons, including the taint of the failed French efforts and the [[Colombia]]n government's unfriendly attitude towards the U.S. continuing the project.  The U.S. first sought to construct a [[History of the Nicaragua Canal|completely new canal]] through [[Nicaragua]] instead.\n\nFrench engineer and financier [[Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla]] played a key role in changing U.S. attitudes.  Bunau-Varilla had a large stake in the failed French canal company, and stood to make money on his investment only if the Panama Canal was completed.  Extensive [[lobbying]] of U.S. lawmakers coupled with his support of a nascent independence movement among the Panamanian people led to a simultaneous revolution in Panama and the negotiation of the [[Hay\u2013Bunau-Varilla Treaty]] which secured both independence for Panama and the right for the U.S. to lead a renewed effort to construct the canal.  Colombia's response to the Panamanian independence movement was tempered by U.S. military presence; the move is often cited as a classic example of the era of [[gunboat diplomacy]].\n\nU.S. success hinged on two factors.  First was converting the original French sea-level plan to a more realistic [[Lock (water navigation)|lock]]-controlled canal.  The second was controlling disease which decimated workers and management alike under the original French attempt.  Initial chief engineer [[John Frank Stevens]] built much of the infrastructure necessary for later construction; slow progress on the canal itself led to his replacement by [[George Washington Goethals]].  Goethals oversaw the bulk of the excavation of the canal, including appointing Major [[David du Bose Gaillard]] to oversee the most daunting project, the [[Culebra Cut]] through the roughest terrain on the route.  Almost as important as the engineering advances was the healthcare advances made during the construction, led by [[William C. Gorgas]], an expert in controlling tropical diseases such as [[yellow fever]] and [[malaria]].  Gorgas was one of the first to recognize the role of [[mosquito]]es in the spread of these diseases, and by focusing on controlling the mosquitoes greatly improved worker conditions.\n\nOn 7 January 1914 the French crane boat ''Alexandre La Valley'' became the first to make the traverse, and on 1 April 1914 the construction was officially completed with the hand-over of the project from the construction company to the Canal Zone government.  The outbreak of World War I caused the cancellation of any official \"grand opening\" celebration, and the canal officially opened to commercial traffic on 15 August 1914 with the transit of the ''[[SS Ancon (1901)|SS Ancon]]''.\n\nDuring World War II, the canal proved a vital part of the U.S. military strategy, allowing ships to transfer easily between the Atlantic and Pacific.  Politically, the Canal remained a territory of the United States until 1977, when the [[Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties]] began the process of transferring territorial control of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to Panama, a process completed on 31 December 1999.\n\nThe Panama Canal continues to be a viable commercial venture and a vital link in world shipping, and continues to be periodically updated and maintained.  The [[Panama Canal expansion project]] started construction in 2007 and began commercial operation on 26 June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger [[Post-Panamax]] and [[New Panamax]] ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the original locks could accommodate.<ref name=NYT062016/>\n\n=={{anchor|The French project}}French project==\n[[File:Kanal MK1888.png|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=See caption|1888 German map of a projected Panama Canal (above) and an alternate Nicaragua route (below)]]\nThe idea of a canal across Central America was revived during the early 19th century. In 1819, the Spanish government authorized the construction of a canal and the creation of a company to build it.\n\nAlthough the project stalled for some time, a number of surveys were made between 1850 and 1875. They indicated that the two most-favorable routes were across Panama (then part of Colombia) and [[Nicaragua canal|Nicaragua]], with a third route across the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] in Mexico another option. The Nicaraguan route was surveyed.\n\n===Conception===\n[[File:Panama-Canal 1880.JPG|thumb|Part de Fondateur of the Compagnie Universelle du Canal Interoc\u00e9anique de Panama, issued 29. November 1880]]\nAfter the 1869 completion of the [[Suez Canal]], France thought that an apparently similar project to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans could be carried out with little difficulty. In 1876 an international company, La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 internationale du Canal interoc\u00e9anique, was created to undertake its construction; two years later, it obtained a [[Concession (contract)|concession]] from the Colombian government (since Panama was a Colombian province) to dig a canal across the isthmus.\n\n[[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], who was in charge of the Suez Canal construction, headed the project. His enthusiastic leadership and his reputation as the man who had built the Suez Canal persuaded speculators and ordinary citizens to invest nearly $400&nbsp;million in the project.\n\nHowever, despite his previous success de Lesseps was not an engineer. The Suez Canal, essentially a ditch dug through a flat, sandy desert, presented few challenges. Although Central America's mountainous spine has a low point in Panama, it is still {{convert|110|m|ft|1|sp=us}} above sea level at its lowest crossing point. The sea-level canal proposed by de Lesseps would require a great deal of excavation through a variety of rock, rather than Suez' sand.\n\nLess-obvious barriers were the rivers crossing the canal, particularly the [[Chagres River|Chagres]] (which flows strongly during the rainy season). Since the water would be a hazard to shipping if it drained into the canal, a sea-level canal would require the river's diversion.\n\nThe most serious problem was [[tropical disease]], particularly [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]], whose methods of transmission were unknown at the time. The legs of hospital beds were placed in cans of water to keep insects from crawling up them, but the stagnant water was an ideal breeding place for mosquitoes (carriers of the diseases).\n\nThe project was plagued by a lack of engineering expertise. In May 1879, an international engineering congress led by de Lesseps convened in Paris. Of its 136 delegates, only 42 were engineers; the others were speculators, politicians and friends of de Lesseps.\n\nHe was convinced that a sea-level canal, dug through the mountainous spine of Central America, could be completed at least as easily as the Suez Canal. The engineering congress estimated the project's cost at $214 million; on February 14, 1880, an engineering commission revised the estimate to $168.6 million. De Lesseps reduced this estimate twice, with no apparent justification: on February 20 to $131.6 million and on March 1 to $120 million. The congress estimated seven or eight years as the time required to complete the canal; de Lesseps reduced this estimate to six years (the Suez Canal required ten).\n\nThe proposed sea-level canal would have a uniform depth of {{convert|9|m|ft|1|sp=us}}, a bottom width of {{convert|22|m|ft|1|sp=us}} and a width at water level of about {{convert|27.5|m|ft|1|sp=us}}; the excavation estimate was {{convert|120000000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. A dam was proposed at [[Gamboa, Panama|Gamboa]] to control flooding of the Chagres River, with channels to drain water away from the canal. However, the Gamboa dam was later found impracticable and the Chagres River problem was left unsolved.\n\n==={{anchor|Construction begins}}Construction===\n[[File:The Panama Canal -- The Great Culebra Cut.jpg|thumb|left|250px|alt=Illustration of a large, terraced excavation|The Culebra Cut in 1885]]\nConstruction of the canal began on January 1, 1881, with digging at [[Culebra Cut|Culebra]] beginning on January 22.{{ref|earthinfo2}} A large labor force was assembled, numbering about 40,000 in 1888 (nine-tenths of whom were [[French Caribbean|afro-Caribbean]] workers from the [[West Indies]]). Although the project attracted good, well-paid French engineers, retaining them was difficult due to disease. The death toll from 1881 to 1889 was estimated at over 22,000, of whom as many as 5,000 were French citizens.<ref>The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870\u20131914, David McCullough, Simon & Schuster, 1978 (a comprehensive history of the building of the canal)</ref>\n\nBy 1885 it had become clear to many that a sea-level canal was impractical, and an elevated canal with locks was preferable; de Lesseps resisted, and a lock canal plan was not adopted until October 1887. By this time increasing mortality rates, as well as financial and engineering problems coupled with frequent [[flood]]s and [[mudslide]]s, indicated that the project was in serious trouble. Work continued under the new plan until May 15, 1889, when the company went bankrupt and the project was suspended. After eight years the canal was about two-fifths completed, and about $234.8 million had been spent.\n\n[[File:CanalPanama.gif|thumb|alt=Photo of the canal's construction|Construction of the canal]]\nThe company's collapse was a [[Panama scandals|scandal in France]], and the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] [[Edouard Drumont]] exploited the role of two Jewish [[speculator]]s in the affair. One hundred and four legislators were found to have been involved in the corruption, and [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] was commissioned by the French parliament to conduct an inquiry which was completed in 1893.{{ref|panscandal}}\n\n==={{anchor|New French Canal Company}}New Panama Canal Company===\nIt soon became clear that the only way to recoup expenses for the stockholders was to continue the project. A new concession was obtained from Colombia, and in 1894 the Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama was created to finish the canal. To comply with the terms of the contract, work began immediately on the Culebra excavation while a team of engineers began a comprehensive study of the project. They eventually settled on a plan for a two-level, lock-based canal.\n\nThe new effort never gained traction, mainly because of US speculation that a canal through Nicaragua would render one through Panama useless. The most men employed on the new project was 3,600 (in 1896), primarily to comply with the terms of the concession and to maintain the existing excavation and equipment in saleable condition. The company had already begun looking for a buyer, with an asking price of $109 million.\n\nIn the US, a congressional [[Isthmian Canal Commission of 1899|Isthmian Canal Commission]] was established in 1899 to examine possibilities for a Central American canal and recommend a route. In November 1901, the commission reported that a US canal should be built through Nicaragua unless the French were willing to sell their holdings for $40 million. The recommendation became law on June 28, 1902, and the New Panama Canal Company was compelled to sell at that price.{{ref|french}}\n\n==={{anchor|The French achievement}}Results===\nAlthough the French effort was, to a large extent, doomed to failure from the beginning due to disease and a lack of understanding of the engineering difficulties, it was not entirely futile. The old and new companies excavated {{convert|59747638|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of material, of which {{convert|14255890|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} was taken from the [[Culebra Cut]]. The old company dredged a channel from [[Panama Bay]] to the port at [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]], and the channel dredged on the Atlantic side (known as the French canal) was useful for bringing in sand and stone for the locks and spillway concrete at [[Gat\u00fan]].\n\nDetailed surveys and studies (particularly those carried out by the new canal company) and machinery, including railroad equipment and vehicles, aided the later American effort. The French lowered the summit of the Culebra Cut along the canal route by five meters (17&nbsp;ft), from {{convert|64|to|59|m}}. An estimated {{convert|22713396|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of excavation, valued at about $25.4 million, and equipment and surveys valued at about $17.4 million were usable by the Americans.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n=={{anchor|Nicaragua}}Nicaraguan canal==\n{{Main|Nicaragua Canal}}\n\nThe 1848 [[California Gold Rush|discovery of gold in California]] and the rush of would-be miners stimulated US interest in building a canal between the oceans. In 1887, a [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] regiment surveyed canal possibilities in Nicaragua. Two years later, the Maritime Canal Company was asked to begin a canal in the area and chose Nicaragua. The company lost money in the [[panic of 1893]], and its work in Nicaragua ceased. In 1897 and 1899, the [[United States Congress]] charged a canal commission with researching possible construction; Nicaragua was chosen as the location both times.\n\nAlthough the Nicaraguan canal proposal was made redundant by the American takeover of the French Panama Canal project, increases in shipping volume and ship sizes have revived interest in the project. A canal across Nicaragua accommodating post-[[Panamax]] ships or a rail link carrying containers between ports on either coast have been proposed.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n=={{anchor|The United States and the canal}}United States==\n{{See also|Panama\u2013Colombia separation|Gunboat diplomacy}}\n\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] believed that a US-controlled canal across Central America was a vital strategic interest of the country. This idea gained wide circulation after the destruction of the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|USS ''Maine'']] in [[Cuba]] on February 15, 1898. Reversing a Walker Commission decision in favor of a Nicaraguan canal, Roosevelt encouraged the acquisition of the French Panama Canal effort. [[George S. Morison (engineer)|George S. Morison]] was the only commission member who argued for the Panama location. The purchase of the French-held land for $40&nbsp;million was authorized by the June 28, 1902 [[Spooner Act]]. Since Panama was then part of [[Colombia]], Roosevelt began negotiating with that country to obtain the necessary rights. In early 1903 the [[Hay\u2013Herr\u00e1n Treaty]] was signed by both nations, but the [[Senate of Colombia]] failed to ratify the treaty.\n\nRoosevelt implied to Panamanian rebels that if they revolted, the US Navy would assist their fight for independence. Panama declared its independence on November 3, 1903, and the [[USS Nashville (PG-7)|USS ''Nashville'']] impeded Colombian interference. The victorious Panamanians gave the United States control of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] on February 23, 1904, for $10&nbsp;million in accordance with the November 18, 1903 [[Hay\u2013Bunau-Varilla Treaty]].\n\n==={{anchor|The takeover|Making sense of the task|Setting the course}}Takeover===\n[[File:Panama-canal-shepherd-map.png|400px|thumb|right|alt=See caption|1923 elevation map of the canal, showing the region's topography]]\nThe United States took control of the French property connected to the canal on May 4, 1904, when Lieutenant Jatara Oneel of the United States Army was presented with the keys during a small ceremony.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The new Panama Canal Zone Control was overseen by the [[Isthmian Canal Commission]] (ICC) during construction.\n\nThe first step taken by the US government was to place all the canal workers under the new administration. The operation was maintained at minimum strength to comply with the canal concession and keep the machinery in working order. The US inherited a small workforce and an assortment of buildings, infrastructure and equipment, much of which had been neglected for fifteen years in the humid jungle environment. There were no facilities in place for a large workforce, and the infrastructure was crumbling.\n\nCataloguing assets was a large job; it took many weeks to card-index available equipment. About 2,150 buildings had been acquired,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=M6JAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA2598&lpg=PA2598&dq=2148+buildings+panama+canal#v=onepage&q=2148%20buildings%20panama%20canal&f=false |title = Annual Report of the Chief of Engineers, United States Army|year = 1916}}</ref> many of which were uninhabitable; housing was an early problem, and the [[Panama Canal Railway|Panama Railway]] was in a state of decay. However, much equipment (such as locomotives, dredges<ref>French Belgian Built Ladder Dredge - http://www.czimages.com/CZMemories/ladderdredge/ladderdredge1.htm  accessed 7/19/2018</ref> and other floating equipment) was still serviceable.\n\n[[File:George W. Goethals cph.3a02121.jpg|thumb|160px|General [[George Washington Goethals]]]]\nAlthough chief engineer [[John Findley Wallace]] was pressured to resume construction, [[red tape]] from Washington stifled his efforts to obtain heavy equipment and caused friction between Wallace and the ICC. He and chief sanitary officer [[William C. Gorgas]] were frustrated by delay, and Wallace resigned in 1905. He was replaced by [[John Frank Stevens]], who arrived on July 26, 1905. Stevens quickly realized that serious investment in infrastructure was necessary and determined to upgrade the railway, improve sanitation in [[Panama City]] and [[Col\u00f3n, Panama|Col\u00f3n]], renovate the old French buildings and build hundreds of new ones for housing. He then began the difficult task of recruiting the large labor force required for construction. Stevens' approach was to press ahead first and obtain approval later. He improved drilling and dirt-removal equipment at the Culebra Cut for greater efficiency, revising the inadequate provisions in place for soil disposal.\n\nNo decision had been made about whether the canal should be a [[Lock (canal)|lock]] or a sea-level one; the ongoing excavation would be useful in either case. In late 1905, President Roosevelt sent a team of engineers to Panama to investigate the relative merits of both types in cost and time. Although the engineers voted eight to five in favor of a sea-level canal, Stevens and the ICC opposed the plan; Stevens' report to Roosevelt was instrumental in convincing the president of the merits of a lock canal and Congress concurred. In November 1906 Roosevelt visited Panama to inspect the canal's progress, the first trip outside the United States by a sitting president.\n\nWhether contract employees or government workers would build the canal was controversial. Bids for the canal's construction were opened in January 1907, and [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]-based contractor [[William J. Oliver (industrialist)|William J. Oliver]] was the low bidder.  Stevens disliked Oliver, and vehemently opposed his choice. Although Roosevelt initially favored the use of a contractor, he eventually decided that army engineers should carry out the work{{ref|DuVal}} and appointed Major [[George Washington Goethals]] as chief engineer (under Stevens' direction) in February 1907. Stevens, frustrated by government inaction and the army involvement, resigned and was replaced by Goethals.{{ref|Mellander}}\n\n==={{anchor|The workforce}}Workforce===\nThe US relied on a stratified workforce to build the canal. High-level engineering jobs, clerical positions, skilled labor and jobs in supporting industries were generally reserved for white Americans, with manual labor primarily by cheap immigrant labor. These jobs were initially filled by Europeans, primarily from Spain, Italy and Greece, many of whom were radical and militant due to political turmoil in Europe. The US then decided to recruit primarily from the British and French West Indies, and these workers provided most of the manual labor on the canal.{{ref|Zieger}}\n\n==={{anchor|Dealing with disease}}Living conditions===\n{{Main|Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal}}\nThe Canal Zone originally had minimal facilities for entertainment and relaxation for the canal workers apart from saloons; as a result, alcohol abuse was a great problem. The inhospitable conditions resulted in many American workers returning home each year.\n\nA program of improvements was implemented. Clubhouses were built, managed by the [[YMCA]], with billiard, assembly and reading rooms, bowling alleys, darkrooms for camera clubs, [[gymnastic]] equipment, ice cream parlors, soda fountains and a [[circulating library]]. Member dues were ten dollars a year, with the remaining upkeep (about $7,000 at the larger clubhouses) paid by the ICC. The commission built baseball fields and arranged rail transportation to games; a competitive league soon developed. Semimonthly Saturday-night dances were held at the Hotel Tivoli, which had a spacious ballroom.\n\nThese measures influenced life in the Canal Zone; alcohol abuse fell, with saloon business declining by 60 percent.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The number of workers leaving the project each year dropped significantly.\n\n==={{anchor|Construction in earnest}}US construction===\n[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|200px|thumb|right|alt=Large excavation through mountains, seen from a rail tunnel|Culebra Cut in 1907]]\nThe work done thus far was preparation, rather than construction. By the time Goethals took over, the construction infrastructure had been created or overhauled and expanded from the French effort and he was soon able to begin construction in earnest.\n\nGoethals divided the project into three divisions: Atlantic, Central and Pacific. The Atlantic Division, under Major [[William L. Sibert]], was responsible for construction of the [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] at the entrance to [[Limon Bay]], the [[Gat\u00fan]] locks and their {{convert|5.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} approach channel, and the [[Gatun Dam]]. The Pacific Division (under Sydney B. Williamson, the only civilian division head) was responsible for the Pacific entrance to the canal, including a {{convert|4.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} breakwater in Panama Bay, the approach channel, and the [[Miraflores (Panama)|Miraflores]] and Pedro Miguel locks and their associated dams. The Central Division, under Major [[David du Bose Gaillard]], was responsible for everything in between. It had arguably the project's greatest challenge: excavating the [[Culebra Cut]] (known as the Gaillard Cut from 1915 to 2000), which involved cutting {{convert|8|mi|km}} through the [[continental divide]] down to 12 meters (40&nbsp;ft) above sea level.\n\nBy August 1907, 765,000 m\u00b3 (1,000,000 cubic yards) per month was being excavated; this set a record for the rainy season; soon afterwards this doubled, before increasing again. At the peak of production, 2,300,000 m\u00b3 (3,000,000 cubic yards) were being excavated per month (the equivalent of digging a [[Channel Tunnel]] every 3\u00bd months).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==={{anchor|The Culebra Cut (Gaillard Cut)}}Culebra Cut===\n{{main|Culebra Cut}}\n[[File:Panama-canal-shepherd-elevation.png|thumb|upright=1.75|alt=See caption|1923 diagram illustrating the elevations through which the canal cuts across the isthmus]]\n\nOne of the greatest barriers to a canal was the [[continental divide]], which originally rose to {{convert|110|m|ft|1}} above sea level at its highest point. The effort to cut through this barrier of rock was one of the greatest challenges faced by the project.\n\nGoethals arrived at the canal with Major [[David du Bose Gaillard]] of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Gaillard was placed in charge of the canal's Central Division, which stretched from the Pedro Miguel locks to the [[Gatun Dam]], and dedicated himself to getting the Culebra Cut (as it was then known) excavated.\n\nThe scale of the work was massive. Six thousand men worked in the cut, drilling holes in which a total of {{convert|27000|t|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of [[dynamite]] were placed to break up the rock (which was then removed by as many as 160 trains per day). Landslides were frequent, due to the [[oxidation]] and weakening of the rock's underlying iron [[stratum|strata]]. Although the scale of the job and the frequent, unpredictable slides generated chaos, Gaillard provided quiet, clear-sighted leadership.\n\nOn May 20, 1913, [[Bucyrus-Erie|Bucyrus]] steam shovels made a passage through the Culebra Cut at the level of the canal bottom. The French effort had reduced the summit to  {{convert|59|m|ft|1}} over a relatively narrow width; the Americans had lowered this to  {{convert|12|m|ft|1}} above sea level over a greater width, and had excavated over {{convert|76000000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of material. About {{convert|23000000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of this material in addition to the planned excavation, in the form of landslides. Dry excavation ended on September 10, 1913; a January slide had added {{convert|1500000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} of earth, but it was decided that this loose material would be removed by dredging when the cut was flooded.\n\n==={{anchor|The dams}}Dams===\nTwo [[lake#Artificial lakes|artificial lakes]] are key parts of the canal: [[Gatun Lake|Gatun]] and Miraflores Lakes. Four dams were constructed to create them. Two small dams at Miraflores impound Miraflores Lake, and a dam at Pedro Miguel encloses the south end of the [[Culebra Cut]] (essentially an arm of Lake Gatun). The [[Gatun Dam]] is the main dam blocking the original course of the [[Chagres River]], creating Gatun Lake.\n\nThe Miraflores dams are an {{convert|825|m|ft|0|adj=on}} earth dam connecting the Miraflores Locks in the west and a {{convert|150|m|ft|0|adj=on}} concrete spillway dam east of the locks. The concrete dam has eight [[floodgate]]s, similar to those on the Gatun [[spillway]]. The earthen, {{convert|430|m|ft|0|adj=on}} Pedro Miguel dam extends from a hill in the west to the lock. Its face is protected by rock [[riprap]] at the water level. The largest and most challenging of the dams is the Gatun Dam. This [[earthen dam]], {{convert|640|m|ft|0}} thick at the base and {{convert|2300|m|ft|0}} long along the top, was the largest of its kind in the world when the canal opened.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==={{anchor|The locks}}Locks===\n[[File:PedroMiguelLocks1913Color.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Concrete wall and rail line|Pedro Miguel Locks under construction during the early 1910s, looking north, showing the center wall and intakes]]\n{{Main|Panama Canal locks}}\n\nThe original lock canal plan called for a two-step set of locks at Sosa Hill and a long Sosa Lake extending to Pedro Miguel.<ref>Panama Canal Official Site - History - https://www.pancanal.com/eng/history/history/ select chapter Locks Design - accessed 7/19/2018</ref>   In late 1907, it was decided to move the Sosa Hill locks further inland to Miraflores, mostly because the new site provided a more stable construction foundation. The resulting small lake Miraflores became a fresh water supply for Panama City.\n\nBuilding the locks began with the first concrete laid at Gatun on August 24, 1909. The Gatun locks are built into a cutting into a hill bordering the lake, requiring the excavation of {{convert|3800000|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of material (mostly rock). The locks were made of {{convert|1564400|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of concrete, with an extensive system of electric railways and [[aerial lift]]s transporting concrete to the lock-construction sites.\n\nThe Pacific-side locks were finished first: the single flight at Pedro Miguel in 1911, and Miraflores in May 1913. The seagoing [[tugboat]] ''Gatun'', an Atlantic-entrance tug used to haul barges, traversed the Gatun locks on September 26, 1913. The trip was successful, although the valves were controlled manually; the central control board was not yet ready.\n\n===Opening===\nOn October 10, 1913, the dike at Gamboa which had kept the Culebra Cut isolated from Gatun Lake was demolished; the detonation was made telegraphically by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in Washington. On January 7, 1914, the ''Alexandre La Valley'',<ref>Official Site Panama Canal - History - https://www.pancanal.com/eng/history/history/  select chapter END OF THE CONSTRUCTION - accessed 7/19/2018</ref> an old French crane boat, became the first ship to make a complete transit of the Panama Canal under its own steam after working its way across during the final stages of construction.\n\nAs construction wound down, the canal team began to disperse. Thousands of workers were laid off, and entire towns were disassembled or demolished. Chief sanitary officer [[William C. Gorgas]], who left to fight pneumonia in the South African gold mines, became surgeon general of the Army. On April 1, 1914 the Isthmian Canal Commission disbanded, and the zone was governed by a Canal Zone Governor; the first governor was [[George Washington Goethals]].\n\nAlthough a large celebration was planned for the canal's opening, the outbreak of [[World War I]] forced the cancellation of the main festivities and it became a modest local affair. The Panama Railway steamship {{SS|Ancon|1901|6}}, piloted by Captain John A. Constantine (the canal's first [[Maritime pilot|pilot]]), made the first official transit on August 15, 1914. With no international dignitaries in attendance, Goethals followed the ''Ancon''{{'s}} progress by railroad.\n\n==={{anchor|Taking stock of the project}}Summary===\n[[File:Panama canal image.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Aerial photo through small clouds|[[International Space Station]] photo showing ''(right to left)'' the Miraflores locks, Miraflores Lake, the Pedro Miguel locks and the [[Centennial Bridge, Panama|Centennial Bridge]]]]\nThe canal was a technological marvel and an important strategic and economic asset to the US. It changed world shipping patterns, removing the need for ships to navigate the [[Drake Passage]] and [[Cape Horn]]. The canal saves a total of about {{convert|7800|mi|km}} on a sea trip from New York to San Francisco.\n\nIts anticipated military significance of the canal was proven during [[World War II]], when the canal helped restore the devastated [[United States Pacific Fleet]].{{ref|Major}} Some of the largest ships the United States had to send through the canal were [[aircraft carrier]]s, particularly [[Essex class aircraft carrier|''Essex'' class]]; they were so large that although the locks could accommodate them, the lampposts along the canal had to be removed.\n\nThe Panama Canal cost the United States about $375 million, including $10 million paid to Panama and $40 million paid to the French company. Although it was the most expensive construction project in US history to that time, it cost about $23 million less than the 1907 estimate despite landslides and an increase in the canal's width. An additional $12 million was spent on fortifications.\n\n[[File:Missouri panama canal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=The USS Missouri fitting tightly in a canal lock|''[[USS Missouri (BB-63)|Missouri]]'' traverses the Panama Canal en route to the United States in October 1945]]\nA total of over 75,000 people worked on the project; at the peak of construction, there were 40,000 workers. According to hospital records, 5,609 workers died from disease and accidents during the American construction era.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nA total of {{convert|182610550|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of material was excavated in the American effort, including the approach channels at the canal ends. Adding the work by the French, the total excavation was about {{convert|204900000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} (over 25 times the volume excavated in the [[Channel Tunnel]] project).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nOf the three presidents whose terms spanned the construction period, Theodore Roosevelt is most associated with the canal and Woodrow Wilson presided over its opening. However, [[William Howard Taft]] may have given the canal its greatest impetus for the longest time. Taft visited Panama five times as Roosevelt's secretary of war and twice as president. He hired John Stevens and later recommended Goethals as Stevens' replacement. Taft became president in 1909, when the canal was half finished, and was in office for most of the remainder of the work. However, Goethals later wrote: \"The real builder of the Panama Canal was Theodore Roosevelt\".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe following words by Roosevelt are displayed in the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] of the canal's administration building in [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]]:{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n<blockquote>It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.</blockquote>\n\nDavid du Bose Gaillard died of a [[brain tumor]] in [[Baltimore]] on December 5, 1913, at age 54. Promoted to colonel only a month earlier, Gaillard never saw the opening of the canal whose creation he directed. The Culebra Cut (as it was originally known) was renamed the Gaillard Cut on April 27, 1915, in his honor. A plaque commemorating Gaillard's work stood over the cut for many years; in 1998 it was moved to the administration building, near a memorial to Goethals.\n\n=={{anchor|The Third Locks Scheme (1939)}}Third-lane plans==<!-- This section is linked from [[Panama Canal]] -->\n\nIn the [[Treaty of the Danish West Indies]], the United States purchased the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]] in 1917 in part to defend the Panama Canal.<ref name=jones2016>{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Halbert |title=Governing the North American Arctic: Sovereignty, Security, and Institutions |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1137493910 |pages=107\u2013116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLPtCwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&vq=mindanao&pg=PA107#v=onepage&q=egan&f=true}}</ref> As the situation in Europe deteriorated during the late 1930s, the US again became concerned about its ability to move warships between the oceans. The largest US battleships already had problems with the canal locks, and there were concerns about the locks being incapacitated by bombing.{{ref|armthird}}{{ref|czthird}}\n\nThese concerns led Congress to pass a resolution on May 1, 1936, authorizing a study of improving the canal's defenses against attack and expanding its capacity to handle large vessels. A special engineering section was created on July 3, 1937, to carry out the study.\nThe section reported to Congress on February 24, 1939, recommending work to protect the existing locks and the construction of a new set of locks capable of carrying larger vessels than the existing locks could accommodate. On August 11, Congress authorized the work.\n\nThree new locks were planned, at Gat\u00fan, Pedro Miguel and Miraflores, parallel to the existing locks with new approach channels. The new locks would add a traffic lane to the canal, with each chamber {{convert|1200|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|140|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|45|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} deep. They would be {{convert|1/2|mi|m|0|abbr=on}} east of the existing Gat\u00fan locks and {{convert|1/4|mi|m|0|abbr=on}} west of the Pedro Miguel and Miraflores locks.\n\nThe first excavations for the new approach channels at Miraflores began on July 1, 1940, following the passage by Congress of an [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations bill]] on June 24, 1940. The first dry excavation at Gat\u00fan began on February 19, 1941. Considerable material was excavated before the project was abandoned, and the approach channels can still be seen paralleling the original channels at Gat\u00fan and Miraflores.\n\nIn 2006, the Autoridad del Canal de Panam\u00e1 (the [[Panama Canal Authority]], or ACP) proposed a plan creating a [[Panama Canal expansion project|third lane of locks]] using part of the abandoned 1940s approach canals. Following a [[referendum]], work began in 2007 and the expanded canal began commercial operations on June 26, 2016. After a two-year delay, the new locks allow the transit of [[Panamax]] ships (which have a greater cargo capacity than the original locks can handle). The first ship to cross the canal through the third set of locks was a Panamax [[container ship]], the Chinese-owned ''Cosco Shipping Panama''. The cost of the expansion was estimated at $5.25 billion.<ref name=NYT062016>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/06/26/world/americas/ap-lt-panama-canal-expansion.html?ref=world&_r=0 | title=Panama Canal Opens $5B Locks, Bullish Despite Shipping Woes | author=The Associated Press | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=2016-06-26 | accessdate=2016-06-26| author-link=The Associated Press }}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Canal handover}}Transfer to Panama==\n{{listen\n|filename=Statement on the Panama Canal Treaty Signing (September 7, 1977) Jimmy Carter.ogv\n|title=Statement on the Panama Canal treaty signing\n|description=Jimmy Carter's speech upon signing the Panama Canal treaty, September 7, 1977\n|filename2=Carter Panama Canal speech.ogg\n|title2=Statement on the Panama Canal treaty signing\n|description2=Audio-only version\n}}\n{{Further|Presidency of Jimmy Carter#Turning over the canal to Panama}}\nAfter construction, the canal and the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] surrounding it were administered by the United States.

The Sibleys borrowed money and began clearing the overgrown property to convert it into a farm with livestock brought from Fort Osage. They completed construction of a cabin and outhouses and moved into Linden Wood in December 1829. As the work on Linden Wood continued, the idea of opening a boarding school evolved.<ref name=\"indom\"/><ref name=\"factbook\"/>\n\nMary Sibley took in students within a year of moving into the cabin. Her 12-year-old sister, Alby, became the first student at Linden Wood in the fall of 1830.

The Sibleys borrowed money and began clearing the overgrown property to convert it into a farm with livestock brought from Fort Osage. They completed construction of a cabin and outhouses and moved into Linden Wood in December 1829. As the work on Linden Wood continued, the idea of opening a boarding school evolved.<ref name=\"indom\"/><ref name=\"factbook\"/>\n\nMary Sibley took in students within a year of moving into the cabin. Her 12-year-old sister, Alby, became the first student at Linden Wood in the fall of 1830.

The new building, Sibley Hall, was completed in July 1857, and at the time contained the entire school.

After the discovery of hominins at [[Taung]] and australopithecine fossils in limestone caves at [[Sterkfontein]], [[Swartkrans]], and [[Kromdraai]] these areas were collectively designated a World Heritage site.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa/History#ref1003524</ref> The first inhabitants of South Africa are collectively referred to as the [[Khoisan]], the Khoi Khoi and the San separately. These groups were displaced or sometimes absorbed by migrating Africans (Bantus) during the [[Bantu expansion]] from Western and Central Africa. While some maintained separateness, others were grouped into a category known as [[Coloureds]], a multiracial ethnic group which includes people with shared ancestry from two or more of these groups: [[Khoisan]], [[Bantus|Bantu]], [[English people|English]], [[Afrikaners]], [[Austronesians]], [[East Asians]] and [[South Asians]]. <ref>https://www.khoisanpeoples.org/indepth/khoi-san-language.htm</ref> European exploration of the African coast began in the 13th century when Portugal committed itself to discover an alternative route to the [[silk road]] that would lead to China. In the 14th and 15th century, Portuguese explorers traveled down the west African Coast, detailing and mapping the coastline and in 1488 they rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. <ref>https://study.com/academy/lesson/portuguese-dutch-exploration-of-south-africa.html</ref> The [[Dutch East India Company]] established a trading post in [[Cape Town]] under the command of [[Jan van Riebeeck]] in 1652,<ref>https://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/dutch-east-india-company-deicvoc</ref> European workers who settled at the Cape became known as the [[Free Burghers]] and gradually established farms in the [[Dutch Cape Colony]].<ref>https://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/style_det.php?styleid=1294</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Invasion of the Cape Colony]] in 1795 and 1806, mass migrations collectively known as the [[Great trek|Great Trek]] occurred during which the Voortrekkers established several [[Boer]] settlements on the interior of South Africa.<ref>http://www.geskiedenis.sariemarais.com/groot%20trek.html</ref> The discoveries of diamonds and gold in the nineteenth century had a profound effect on the fortunes of the region, propelling it onto the world stage and introducing a shift away from an exclusively agrarian-based economy towards industrialisation and the development of urban infrastructure. The discoveries also led to new conflicts culminating in open warfare between the [[Boer]] settlers and the British Empire, fought essentially for control over the nascent South African mining industry.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Boers in the Anglo-Boer or [[South African War]] (1899\u20131902), the [[Union of South Africa]] was created as a [[Associated state|self-governing]] dominion of the [[British Empire]] on 31 May 1910 in terms of the [[South Africa Act 1909]], which amalgamated the four previously separate British colonies: [[Cape Colony]], [[Colony of Natal]], [[Transvaal Colony]], and [[Orange River Colony]]. The country became a fully sovereign [[nation state]] within the British Empire, in 1934 following enactment of the [[Status of the Union Act]]. The monarchy came to an end on 31 May 1961, replaced by a [[republic]] as the consequence of a [[1960 South African republic referendum|1960 referendum]], which legitimised the country becoming the [[Republic of South Africa]].\n\nFrom 1948\u20131994, South African politics was dominated by [[Afrikaner nationalism]]. Racial segregation and white minority rule known officially as [[apartheid]], an [[Afrikaans]] word meaning \"separateness\u201d, was implemented in 1948. On 27 April 1994, after decades of armed struggle, [[terrorism]] and international opposition to apartheid, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) achieved victory in the country's first democratic election. Since then, the African National Congress has governed South Africa, in an alliance with the [[South African Communist Party]] and the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]].\n\n==Early history (before 1652)==\n{{Main|Early history of South Africa}}\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{see|Khoisan|Khoisanid|Peopling of Africa}}\nScientists researching the periods before written historical records were made have established that the territory of what is now referred to generically as South Africa was one of the important centers of [[human evolution]]. It was inhabited by [[Australopithecine]]s since at least 2.5 million years ago. [[Anatomically modern humans|Modern human]] settlement occurred around 125,000 years ago in the Middle Stone Age, as shown by archaeological discoveries at [[Klasies River Caves]].<ref>Bert Woodhouse, ''The Rock Art of the Golden Gate and Clarens Districts'', Johannesburg: Waterman 1996, p.34 \u2013 (citing report by Professor C van Riet Lowe and Dr D J H Visser, published in 1955 by government Department of Mines). {{ISBN|1 874959 31 5}}</ref> The first human habitation is associated with a DNA group originating in a northwestern area of southern Africa and still prevalent in the indigenous [[Khoisan]] ([[Khoi]] and [[San people|San]]). Southern Africa was later populated by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu-speaking people]] who [[Bantu expansion|migrated from the western region of central Africa]] during the early centuries AD.\n\nAt the [[Blombos cave]] Professor [[Raymond Dart]] discovered the skull of a 2.51 million year old [[Taung Child]] in 1924, the first example of ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' ever found. Following in Dart's footsteps [[Robert Broom]] discovered a new much more robust hominid in 1938 ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]'' at [[Kromdraai]], and in 1947 uncovered several more examples of ''Australopithecus africanus'' at [[Sterkfontein]]. In further research at the Blombos cave in 2002, stones were discovered engraved with grid or cross-hatch patterns, dated to some 70,000 years ago. This has been interpreted as the earliest example ever discovered of abstract art or symbolic art created by ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1753326.stm | work=BBC News | title='Oldest' prehistoric art unearthed | date=10 January 2002}}</ref>\n\nMany more species of early hominid have come to light in recent decades. The oldest is [[Little Foot]], a collection of footbones of an unknown hominid between 2.2 and 3.3 million years old, discovered at Sterkfontein by [[Ronald J. Clarke]]. An important recent find was that of 1.9 million year old ''[[Australopithecus sediba]]'', discovered in 2008. In 2015, the discovery near Johannesburg of a previously unknown species of ''Homo'' was announced, named ''[[Homo naledi]]''. It has been described as one of the most important paleontological discoveries in modern times.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150910-homo-naledi-human-ancestor-species-reaction-science/ ''National Geographic'', \"New Human Ancestor Elicits Awe\u2014and Many Questions\"], 10 September 2015.

The settlers, incorrectly, believed that the Cape Colony administration had taken the money due to them as payment for freeing their slaves. Those settlers who were allocated money could only claim it in Britain in person or through an agent.

Philip's intention was for the Griquas to protect the missionary station there against [[banditti]] in the region, and as a bulwark against the northward movement of white settlers from the Cape Colony. Friction between the Griquas and the settlers over land rights resulted in British troops being sent to the region in 1845. It marked the beginning of nine years of British intervention in the affairs of the region, which the British named Transorange.<ref>Karel Schoeman, ''The British Presence in the Transorange 1845\u20131854'', Human & Rosseau, Cape Town, 1992, p.11, {{ISBN|0-7981-2965-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1861, to avoid the imminent prospect of either being colonised by the Cape Colony or coming into conflict with the expanding Boer Republic of [[Orange Free State]], most of the Philippolis Griquas embarked on a further trek.

The consequent frontier wars, known as the [[Xhosa Wars]], were unofficially referred to by the British colonial authorities as the \"[[Kaffir (racial term)|Kaffir]]\" wars. In the southeastern part of South Africa, The Boers and the Xhosa clashed along the Great Fish River, and in 1779 the first of nine frontier wars erupted. For nearly 100 years subsequently, the Xhosa fought the settlers sporadically, first the Boers or Afrikaners and later the British. In the Fourth Frontier War, which lasted from 1811 to 1812, the British forced the Xhosa back across the Great Fish River and established forts along this boundary.\n\nThe increasing economic involvement of the British in southern Africa from the 1820s, and especially following the discovery of first diamonds at Kimberley and gold in the Transvaal, resulted in pressure for land and African labour, and led to increasingly tense relations with African states.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1818 differences between two Xhosa leaders, Ndlambe and Ngqika, ended in Ngqika's defeat, but the British continued to recognise Ngqika as the paramount chief. He appealed to the British for help against Ndlambe, who retaliated in 1819 during the Fifth Frontier War by attacking the British colonial town of Grahamstown.\n\n====Wars against the Zulu====\n[[File:Cetshwayo-c1875.jpg|thumb|200px|King [[Cetshwayo kaMpande|Cetshwayo]] (ca. 1875)]]In the eastern part of what is today South Africa, in the region named Natalia by the Boer trekkers, the latter negotiated an agreement with Zulu King [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona]] allowing the Boers to settle in part of the then Zulu kingdom.  Cattle rustling ensued and a party of Boers under the leadership of [[Piet Retief]] were killed.\n\nSubsequent to the killing of the Retief party, the Boers defended themselves against a Zulu attack, at the Ncome River on 16 December 1838. An estimated five thousand Zulu warriors were involved. The Boers took a defensive position with the high banks of the Ncome River forming a natural barrier to their rear with their ox waggons as barricades between themselves and the attacking Zulu army. About three thousand Zulu warriors died in the clash known historically as the [[Battle of Blood River]].<ref>Ngubane, Jordan K. ''An African Explains Apartheid''.

Following Lord Carnarvon's successful introduction of federation in Canada, it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa.\n\nIn 1874, Sir Henry Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as High Commissioner for the British Empire to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the South African Republic and the Kingdom of Zululand and its army. Frere, on his own initiative, without the approval of the British government and with the intent of instigating a war with the Zulu, had presented an ultimatum on 11 December 1878, to the Zulu king Cetshwayo with which the Zulu king could not comply. Bartle Frere then sent [[Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] to invade Zululand. The war is notable for several particularly bloody battles, including an overwhelming victory by the Zulu at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], as well as for being a landmark in the timeline of imperialism in the region.\n\nBritain's eventual defeat of the Zulus, marking the end of the Zulu nation's independence, was accomplished with the assistance of Zulu collaborators who harboured cultural and political resentments against centralised Zulu authority.<ref>Dacob Dlamini, [http://www.rdm.co.za/politics/2015/07/27/jacob-zuma-a-spawn-of-collaborators-trying-to-right-old-wrongs \"Jacob Zuma a spawn of collaborators trying to right old wrongs\"], ''Rand Daily Mail'', 30 July 2015.

In 1845, a treaty was signed between the British colonists and Moshoeshoe, which recognised white settlement in the area. No firm boundaries were drawn between the area of white settlement and Moshoeshoe's kingdom, which led to border clashes. Moshoeshoe was under the impression he was loaning grazing land to the settlers in accordance with African precepts of occupation rather than ownership, while the settlers believed they had been granted permanent land rights. Afrikaner settlers in particular were loathe to live under Moshoesoe's authority and among Africans.<ref>David B Coplan, ''Unconquered Territory: Narrating the Caledon Valley'', Journal of African Cultural Studies, Vol 13, No 2, December 2000, p.192</ref>\n\nThe British, who at that time controlled the area between the Orange and Vaal Rivers called the [[Orange River Sovereignty]],  decided a discernible boundary was necessary and proclaimed a line named the Warden Line, dividing the area between British and Basotho territories. This led to conflict between the Basotho and the British, who were defeated by Moshoeshoe's warriors at the battle of Viervoet in 1851.\n\nAs punishment to the Basotho, the governor and commander-in-chief of the Cape Colony, Sir George Cathcart, deployed troops to the Mohokare River; Moshoeshoe was ordered to pay a fine. When he did not pay the fine in full, a battle broke out on the Berea Plateau in 1852, where the British suffered heavy losses. In 1854, the British handed over the territory to the Boers through the signing of the [[Sand River Convention]].

In September 1854, 28 Boers accused of cattle rustling were killed in three separate incidents by an alliance of the Ndebele chiefdoms of Mokopane and Mankopane. Mokopane and his followers, anticipating retaliation by the settlers, retreated into the mountain caves known as Gwasa, (or Makapansgat in Afrikaans). In late October, Boer commandos supported by local Kgatla tribal collaborators laid siege to the caves. By the end of the siege, about three weeks later, Mokopane and between 1,000 and 3,000 people had died in the caves. The survivors were captured and allegedly enslaved.<ref>Isabel Hofmeyr, ''We Spend Our Years as a Tale that is Told: Oral Historical Narrative in a South African Chiefdom''.

Further friction was caused by the refusal of Sekhukhune to allow prospectors to search for gold in territory he considered to be sovereign and independent under his authority. The First Sekhukhune War of 1876 was conducted by the Boers, and the two separate campaigns of the Second Sekhukhune War of 1878/1879 were conducted by the British.<ref>H W Kinsey,[http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol025hk.html \"The Sekukuni Wars\"], ''South African Military History Journal'',\nVol 2 No 5 \u2013 June 1973.

After the discovery of hominins at [[Taung]] and australopithecine fossils in limestone caves at [[Sterkfontein]], [[Swartkrans]], and [[Kromdraai]] these areas were collectively designated a World Heritage site.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa/History#ref1003524</ref> The first inhabitants of South Africa are collectively referred to as the [[Khoisan]], the Khoi Khoi and the San separately. These groups were displaced or sometimes absorbed by migrating Africans (Bantus) during the [[Bantu expansion]] from Western and Central Africa. While some maintained separateness, others were grouped into a category known as [[Coloureds]], a multiracial ethnic group which includes people with shared ancestry from two or more of these groups: [[Khoisan]], [[Bantus|Bantu]], [[English people|English]], [[Afrikaners]], [[Austronesians]], [[East Asians]] and [[South Asians]]. <ref>https://www.khoisanpeoples.org/indepth/khoi-san-language.htm</ref> European exploration of the African coast began in the 13th century when Portugal committed itself to discover an alternative route to the [[silk road]] that would lead to China. In the 14th and 15th century, Portuguese explorers traveled down the west African Coast, detailing and mapping the coastline and in 1488 they rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. <ref>https://study.com/academy/lesson/portuguese-dutch-exploration-of-south-africa.html</ref> The [[Dutch East India Company]] established a trading post in [[Cape Town]] under the command of [[Jan van Riebeeck]] in 1652,<ref>https://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/dutch-east-india-company-deicvoc</ref> European workers who settled at the Cape became known as the [[Free Burghers]] and gradually established farms in the [[Dutch Cape Colony]].<ref>https://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/style_det.php?styleid=1294</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Invasion of the Cape Colony]] in 1795 and 1806, mass migrations collectively known as the [[Great trek|Great Trek]] occurred during which the Voortrekkers established several [[Boer]] settlements on the interior of South Africa.<ref>http://www.geskiedenis.sariemarais.com/groot%20trek.html</ref> The discoveries of diamonds and gold in the nineteenth century had a profound effect on the fortunes of the region, propelling it onto the world stage and introducing a shift away from an exclusively agrarian-based economy towards industrialisation and the development of urban infrastructure. The discoveries also led to new conflicts culminating in open warfare between the [[Boer]] settlers and the British Empire, fought essentially for control over the nascent South African mining industry.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Boers in the Anglo-Boer or [[South African War]] (1899\u20131902), the [[Union of South Africa]] was created as a [[Associated state|self-governing]] dominion of the [[British Empire]] on 31 May 1910 in terms of the [[South Africa Act 1909]], which amalgamated the four previously separate British colonies: [[Cape Colony]], [[Colony of Natal]], [[Transvaal Colony]], and [[Orange River Colony]]. The country became a fully sovereign [[nation state]] within the British Empire, in 1934 following enactment of the [[Status of the Union Act]]. The monarchy came to an end on 31 May 1961, replaced by a [[republic]] as the consequence of a [[1960 South African republic referendum|1960 referendum]], which legitimised the country becoming the [[Republic of South Africa]].\n\nFrom 1948\u20131994, South African politics was dominated by [[Afrikaner nationalism]]. Racial segregation and white minority rule known officially as [[apartheid]], an [[Afrikaans]] word meaning \"separateness\u201d, was implemented in 1948. On 27 April 1994, after decades of armed struggle, [[terrorism]] and international opposition to apartheid, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) achieved victory in the country's first democratic election.

The language law caused friction, distrust and dissatisfaction.\n[[File:TrekBoers crossing the Karoo.jpg|thumb|300px|An account of the first [[trekboer]]s]]\n\nAnother reason for Dutch-speaking white farmers trekking away from the Cape was the abolition of slavery by the British government on Emancipation Day, 1 December 1838.

The settlers, incorrectly, believed that the Cape Colony administration had taken the money due to them as payment for freeing their slaves.

Philip's intention was for the Griquas to protect the missionary station there against [[banditti]] in the region, and as a bulwark against the northward movement of white settlers from the Cape Colony. Friction between the Griquas and the settlers over land rights resulted in British troops being sent to the region in 1845. It marked the beginning of nine years of British intervention in the affairs of the region, which the British named Transorange.<ref>Karel Schoeman, ''The British Presence in the Transorange 1845\u20131854'', Human & Rosseau, Cape Town, 1992, p.11, {{ISBN|0-7981-2965-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1861, to avoid the imminent prospect of either being colonised by the Cape Colony or coming into conflict with the expanding Boer Republic of [[Orange Free State]], most of the Philippolis Griquas embarked on a further trek.

The consequent frontier wars, known as the [[Xhosa Wars]], were unofficially referred to by the British colonial authorities as the \"[[Kaffir (racial term)|Kaffir]]\" wars. In the southeastern part of South Africa, The Boers and the Xhosa clashed along the Great Fish River, and in 1779 the first of nine frontier wars erupted. For nearly 100 years subsequently, the Xhosa fought the settlers sporadically, first the Boers or Afrikaners and later the British. In the Fourth Frontier War, which lasted from 1811 to 1812, the British forced the Xhosa back across the Great Fish River and established forts along this boundary.\n\nThe increasing economic involvement of the British in southern Africa from the 1820s, and especially following the discovery of first diamonds at Kimberley and gold in the Transvaal, resulted in pressure for land and African labour, and led to increasingly tense relations with African states.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1818 differences between two Xhosa leaders, Ndlambe and Ngqika, ended in Ngqika's defeat, but the British continued to recognise Ngqika as the paramount chief. He appealed to the British for help against Ndlambe, who retaliated in 1819 during the Fifth Frontier War by attacking the British colonial town of Grahamstown.\n\n====Wars against the Zulu====\n[[File:Cetshwayo-c1875.jpg|thumb|200px|King [[Cetshwayo kaMpande|Cetshwayo]] (ca. 1875)]]In the eastern part of what is today South Africa, in the region named Natalia by the Boer trekkers, the latter negotiated an agreement with Zulu King [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona]] allowing the Boers to settle in part of the then Zulu kingdom.  Cattle rustling ensued and a party of Boers under the leadership of [[Piet Retief]] were killed.\n\nSubsequent to the killing of the Retief party, the Boers defended themselves against a Zulu attack, at the Ncome River on 16 December 1838. An estimated five thousand Zulu warriors were involved. The Boers took a defensive position with the high banks of the Ncome River forming a natural barrier to their rear with their ox waggons as barricades between themselves and the attacking Zulu army. About three thousand Zulu warriors died in the clash known historically as the [[Battle of Blood River]].<ref>Ngubane, Jordan K. ''An African Explains Apartheid''.

Following Lord Carnarvon's successful introduction of federation in Canada, it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa.\n\nIn 1874, Sir Henry Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as High Commissioner for the British Empire to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the South African Republic and the Kingdom of Zululand and its army. Frere, on his own initiative, without the approval of the British government and with the intent of instigating a war with the Zulu, had presented an ultimatum on 11 December 1878, to the Zulu king Cetshwayo with which the Zulu king could not comply. Bartle Frere then sent [[Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] to invade Zululand. The war is notable for several particularly bloody battles, including an overwhelming victory by the Zulu at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], as well as for being a landmark in the timeline of imperialism in the region.\n\nBritain's eventual defeat of the Zulus, marking the end of the Zulu nation's independence, was accomplished with the assistance of Zulu collaborators who harboured cultural and political resentments against centralised Zulu authority.<ref>Dacob Dlamini, [http://www.rdm.co.za/politics/2015/07/27/jacob-zuma-a-spawn-of-collaborators-trying-to-right-old-wrongs \"Jacob Zuma a spawn of collaborators trying to right old wrongs\"], ''Rand Daily Mail'', 30 July 2015.

In 1845, a treaty was signed between the British colonists and Moshoeshoe, which recognised white settlement in the area. No firm boundaries were drawn between the area of white settlement and Moshoeshoe's kingdom, which led to border clashes. Moshoeshoe was under the impression he was loaning grazing land to the settlers in accordance with African precepts of occupation rather than ownership, while the settlers believed they had been granted permanent land rights. Afrikaner settlers in particular were loathe to live under Moshoesoe's authority and among Africans.<ref>David B Coplan, ''Unconquered Territory: Narrating the Caledon Valley'', Journal of African Cultural Studies, Vol 13, No 2, December 2000, p.192</ref>\n\nThe British, who at that time controlled the area between the Orange and Vaal Rivers called the [[Orange River Sovereignty]],  decided a discernible boundary was necessary and proclaimed a line named the Warden Line, dividing the area between British and Basotho territories. This led to conflict between the Basotho and the British, who were defeated by Moshoeshoe's warriors at the battle of Viervoet in 1851.\n\nAs punishment to the Basotho, the governor and commander-in-chief of the Cape Colony, Sir George Cathcart, deployed troops to the Mohokare River; Moshoeshoe was ordered to pay a fine. When he did not pay the fine in full, a battle broke out on the Berea Plateau in 1852, where the British suffered heavy losses.

A series of battles ensued, in which Mzilikazi was eventually defeated.

In September 1854, 28 Boers accused of cattle rustling were killed in three separate incidents by an alliance of the Ndebele chiefdoms of Mokopane and Mankopane. Mokopane and his followers, anticipating retaliation by the settlers, retreated into the mountain caves known as Gwasa, (or Makapansgat in Afrikaans). In late October, Boer commandos supported by local Kgatla tribal collaborators laid siege to the caves. By the end of the siege, about three weeks later, Mokopane and between 1,000 and 3,000 people had died in the caves. The survivors were captured and allegedly enslaved.<ref>Isabel Hofmeyr, ''We Spend Our Years as a Tale that is Told: Oral Historical Narrative in a South African Chiefdom''.

Further friction was caused by the refusal of Sekhukhune to allow prospectors to search for gold in territory he considered to be sovereign and independent under his authority.
