For the entirety of this period, south east England was covered by a warm, shallow sea in which [[coccolithophores]], single-celled [[alga]]e with small [[calcite]] skeletons, thrived. As the phytoplankton died, their calcium-rich shells were deposited on the sea bed and, over time, formed the chalk we know today.\n\nOverlying the chalk across much of the higher ground on the hill, is a deposit of [[clay-with-flints]]. Although the origins of this layer are uncertain, the clay is thought to have been formed during several periods of glaciation and was produced by [[cryoturbation]] and decalcification of the chalk.<ref name=Gallois>{{cite journal |last1=Gallois |first1= RW |title= The origin of the Clay-with-flints: the missing link|journal=Geoscience in South-West England|date=2009|volume=12|pages=153\u2013161}}</ref> This hypothesis is supported by the presence of flint, which is also found in the underlying strata.<ref name=Gallois/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Anon|title=Clay-with Flints formation|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=CWF|website=The BGS Lexicon of Named Rock Units|publisher=BGS|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Betchworth limekiln - geograph.org.uk - 869914.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Smidth Kiln at [[Betchworth Quarry and Lime Kilns|Betchworth Quarry]] was constructed in around 1901.<ref name=NHL_Betchworth>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1021346}}</ref>]]\nThe sandy deposits on Headley Heath have their origin in the [[Quaternary]].

For the entirety of this period, south east England was covered by a warm, shallow sea in which [[coccolithophores]], single-celled [[alga]]e with small [[calcite]] skeletons, thrived. As the phytoplankton died, their calcium-rich shells were deposited on the sea bed and, over time, formed the chalk we know today.\n\nOverlying the chalk across much of the higher ground on the hill, is a deposit of [[clay-with-flints]]. Although the origins of this layer are uncertain, the clay is thought to have been formed during several periods of glaciation and was produced by [[cryoturbation]] and decalcification of the chalk.<ref name=Gallois>{{cite journal |last1=Gallois |first1= RW |title= The origin of the Clay-with-flints: the missing link|journal=Geoscience in South-West England|date=2009|volume=12|pages=153\u2013161}}</ref> This hypothesis is supported by the presence of flint, which is also found in the underlying strata.<ref name=Gallois/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Anon|title=Clay-with Flints formation|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=CWF|website=The BGS Lexicon of Named Rock Units|publisher=BGS|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Betchworth limekiln - geograph.org.uk - 869914.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Smidth Kiln at [[Betchworth Quarry and Lime Kilns|Betchworth Quarry]] was constructed in around 1901.<ref name=NHL_Betchworth>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1021346}}</ref>]]\nThe sandy deposits on Headley Heath have their origin in the [[Quaternary]].

Other Pakistan team players like Najaf Shah, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahab_Riaz|Whahab Riaz]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Akmal|Adnan Akmal]], and Famous Pakistani [https://adeelchaudry.pk Food connoisseur], chef and [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUJAmh8MQVK31FpeC7cHXNw?view_as=subscriber philanthropist Adeel Chaudry] was also part of the team. and quickly progressed through Under-19 level, although at that time he was much younger than the age limits suggest, making his senior debut for Lahore Whites in 2000 aged only 15. His talent was noticed immediately, which led to him being given a place in the Pakistan A team against [[England national cricket team|England]] soon after. However, instead of rushing straight for the limelight of international cricket, he got his head down and consolidated by playing consistently for his region and the youth teams, until the Pakistan selectors finally drafted him in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketfundas.com/salmanbutt.html |title=Salman Butt: Opening the Future of Success |publisher=Cricketfundas.com |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===International cricket===\n\nAfter his debut, Butt was dropped, and he struggled to regain his place due to some stiff competition for the openers' spots. He returned for the Champions' Trophy in 2004 and scored his first fifty for Pakistan in the Paktel Cup against [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]]. In the ODI against India on 13 November 2004, as Pakistan chased down 292, he formed partnerships first with [[Shoaib Malik]], putting on 113, and subsequently with [[Inzamam-Ul-Haq]]. Despite having retired for seven overs due to severe cramp, he returned to steer Pakistan home, finishing on 108 not out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGcTn9ZAWEI |title=Inzamam and Salman Butt sink India!! |publisher=YouTube |date=28 March 2007 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nYet 2005 saw little improvement, and doubts circulated about his defensive technique, causing him to be shuffled in and out of the side. But things started looking up again during the winter Test series against England, in which he scored a century and two fifties, with a more cautious attitude to his innings building than he had previously shown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/player/42683.html |title=Cricinfo \u2013 Players and Officials \u2013 Salman Butt |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor his performances in 2008, he was named as 12th man in the World ODI XI by the ICC.<ref>http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/369272.html</ref>\n\n===Appointment as Test captain===\n\nOn 17 July 2010, the [[Pakistan Cricket Board]] appointed Butt as captain of the Pakistani Test squad in place of [[Shahid Afridi]], who announced his retirement from Test cricket after Pakistan lost the first [[Australian cricket team against Pakistan in England in 2010|test match against Australia]].<ref name=\"captain\">{{cite web|title=Salman Butt named captain for rest of England tour|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/pakistan-v-australia-2010/content/current/story/467691.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=17 July 2010|author=Osman Samiuddin}}</ref> He became the 28th captain of the Pakistani Test team and the fifth to lead them since January 2009.<ref name=\"captain\"/>\n\nOn 23 July 2010, Salman Butt led Pakistan to victory against Australia in his first appearance as Pakistan's test team captain.\n\n===Spot-fixing scandal===\n\n{{main|Pakistan cricket spot-fixing controversy}}\nIn August 2010, Butt and two other players, [[Mohammad Amir]] and [[Mohammad Asif (cricketer)|Mohammad Asif]], were among those named by a ''[[News of the World]]'' sting where undercover reporters paid an agent loosely affiliated with several players on Pakistan's squad a bribe in return for detailed information on when no-balls would be bowled.\n\nButt, Amir, and Asif were dropped from the Pakistan team for the limited-over series (two Twenty20 games, and five ODI games). However, on 2 September 2010, after the warm-up [[List A]] game between Pakistan and Somerset, the [[International Cricket Council]] announced that they had suspended Asif, Amir and Butt under the provisions of the ICC's Anti-Corruption Code.

His talent was noticed immediately, which led to him being given a place in the Pakistan A team against [[England national cricket team|England]] soon after. However, instead of rushing straight for the limelight of international cricket, he got his head down and consolidated by playing consistently for his region and the youth teams, until the Pakistan selectors finally drafted him in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketfundas.com/salmanbutt.html |title=Salman Butt: Opening the Future of Success |publisher=Cricketfundas.com |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===International cricket===\n\nAfter his debut, Butt was dropped, and he struggled to regain his place due to some stiff competition for the openers' spots.

In the ODI against India on 13 November 2004, as Pakistan chased down 292, he formed partnerships first with [[Shoaib Malik]], putting on 113, and subsequently with [[Inzamam-Ul-Haq]].

But things started looking up again during the winter Test series against England, in which he scored a century and two fifties, with a more cautious attitude to his innings building than he had previously shown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/player/42683.html |title=Cricinfo \u2013 Players and Officials \u2013 Salman Butt |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor his performances in 2008, he was named as 12th man in the World ODI XI by the ICC.<ref>http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/369272.html</ref>\n\n===Appointment as Test captain===\n\nOn 17 July 2010, the [[Pakistan Cricket Board]] appointed Butt as captain of the Pakistani Test squad in place of [[Shahid Afridi]], who announced his retirement from Test cricket after Pakistan lost the first [[Australian cricket team against Pakistan in England in 2010|test match against Australia]].<ref name=\"captain\">{{cite web|title=Salman Butt named captain for rest of England tour|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/pakistan-v-australia-2010/content/current/story/467691.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=17 July 2010|author=Osman Samiuddin}}</ref> He became the 28th captain of the Pakistani Test team and the fifth to lead them since January 2009.<ref name=\"captain\"/>\n\nOn 23 July 2010, Salman Butt led Pakistan to victory against Australia in his first appearance as Pakistan's test team captain.\n\n===Spot-fixing scandal===\n\n{{main|Pakistan cricket spot-fixing controversy}}\nIn August 2010, Butt and two other players, [[Mohammad Amir]] and [[Mohammad Asif (cricketer)|Mohammad Asif]], were among those named by a ''[[News of the World]]'' sting where undercover reporters paid an agent loosely affiliated with several players on Pakistan's squad a bribe in return for detailed information on when no-balls would be bowled.\n\nButt, Amir, and Asif were dropped from the Pakistan team for the limited-over series (two Twenty20 games, and five ODI games). However, on 2 September 2010, after the warm-up [[List A]] game between Pakistan and Somerset, the [[International Cricket Council]] announced that they had suspended Asif, Amir and Butt under the provisions of the ICC's Anti-Corruption Code. The statement from the ICC stated that the three players were charged \"under various offences under Article 2 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code for Players and Player Support Personnel relating to alleged irregular behaviour during, and in relation to, the fourth Test between England and Pakistan at Lord's last month\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/england-v-pakistan-2010/content/current/story/475624.html|title=ICC suspend trio under anti-corruption code|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nLater it became known that Butt and the other two players implicated in the scandal were in possession of bills with the same serial numbers as those the reporter had paid Majeed earlier. Butt was provisionally suspended from playing International Cricket due to the fact that the ICC wanted his name cleared before he resumed playing cricket. In late September, Butt filed an appeal to the ICC asking them to lift his temporary suspension.<ref>{{cite web|title=Salman Butt appeals against ICC suspension|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/current/story/479203.html|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref> After Mohammad Asif had dropped his appeal against the charges so that he could understand the charges filed against him, Butt said he was determined to prove his innocence and that his appeal was going to go ahead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/current/story/483267.html |title=Spot-fixing controversy: Salman Butt determined to prove innocence &#124; Pakistan Cricket News &#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Butt stated \"I do not want to comment on ''The News of the World'' because everybody knows what kind of paper it is.

One charge was dismissed against Butt from the third Test match (batting out a maiden over), but the other charges (failing to report an advance from the third Test match and ordering Asif and Amir to bowl no-balls in the fourth Test) were proved, and Butt was banned from the sport of cricket for ten years, five of which were suspended should he not commit any further offences and participate in a Pakistani Cricket Board anti-corruption program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/current/story/499614.html |title=The spot-fixing scandal: Butt out for 10 years, Asif 7 and Amir 5 &#124; Cricket News &#124; Cricinfo ICC Site |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Return to domestic cricket===\nIn January 2016, the [[Pakistan Cricket Board|PCB]] allowed Butt to play in the National One Day Cup, in which he played for [[Water and Power Development Authority cricket team|WAPDA]] and scored 536 in 7 matches at an average of 107, ending up one of the leading run-scorers in the tournament.

He uses his superb wrist work to angle the bat, placing the ball into gaps using the pace of the ball to his advantage; a very good technique for ODIs where it is best to keep the scoreboard ticking all the time. He also has the ability to cut the ball very fine down to [[Cricket fielding positions|third man]] if there are no [[Cricket fielding positions|slips]], especially against spin bowlers, as he showed to great effect in his above-mentioned innings of 108 not out. These are his specialties, but he has large range of shots.

It had nothing to do with justice at all, but it has to do with maintaining discipline The US army was very concerned that black soldiers particularly did not learn to act differently when they were away from home and race was one way they could be reminded of their place. |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"1997 Radio Chocolate Soldier From the USA 003\">{{cite AV media| title=Chocolate Soldier From the USA | credits=[[BBC]] | publisher=WNKU - NKU's National Public Radio station | airdate=26 February 1999 |url=http://caa.nku.edu/programreview/docs/sociologyreview05.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609201126/http://caa.nku.edu/programreview/docs/sociologyreview05.pdf | archivedate=9 June 2010 | quote=US Broadcast}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"1997 Radio Chocolate Soldier From the USA 004\">{{cite book|title=Amnesty: The Journal of the British Section of Amnesty International, Issues 59-86 |year=1993|publisher=The Section|page=79|quote=Black soldiers who fought in the European theatre of operations in World War II were treated shamefully - and still are, said Marc Jobst }}</ref>\n\n<!--  #######          Ref List  - TELEVISION DOCUMENTARY          ######  -->\n\n<ref name=\"1997 Amnesty Media Awards TELEVISION DOCUMENTARY\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/pressawards97/tvdoc.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060129234520/http://www.amnesty.org.uk/pressawards97/tvdoc.html |archivedate=29 January 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"1997 Channel Four Witness Rwanda - The Betrayal 001\">{{cite episode|title=Rwanda - The Betrayal |series=Witness |network=[[Channel 4]] |airdate=16 May 1996 |quote=Library Synopisis \"The atrocities in Rwanda two years ago, when members of the Hutu majority slaughtered thousands of men, women and children from the Tutsi minority, are thought to be the worst committed since the Nazi holocaust.
