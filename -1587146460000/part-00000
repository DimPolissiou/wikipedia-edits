The purifying structure of the Sanskrit language removes these imperfections.

Da\u1e47\u1e0din acknowledged that there are words and confusing structures in Prakrit that thrive independent of Sanskrit.

There is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the Gothick and the Celtick [sic], though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the Sanscrit; and the Old Persian might be added to the same family.\n|William Jones, 1786|quoted by Thomas Burrow in ''The Sanskrit Language''{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|p=6}}}}\n\nIn order to explain the common features shared by Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages, the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory]] states that the original speakers of what became Sanskrit arrived in the Indian subcontinent from the north-west sometime during the early second millennium BCE.

A part of the difficulty is the lack of sufficient textual, archaeological and epigraphical evidence for the ancient Prakrit languages with rare exceptions such as Pali, leading to a tendency of [[anachronism|anachronistic]] errors.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}} Sanskrit and Prakrit languages may be divided into Old Indo-Aryan (1500 BCE\u2013600 BCE), Middle Indo-Aryan (600 BCE\u20131000 CE) and New Indo-Aryan (1000 CE\u2013current), each can further be subdivided in early, middle or second, and late evolutionary substages.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}}\n\nVedic Sanskrit belongs to the early Old Indo-Aryan while Classical Sanskrit to the later Old Indo-Aryan stage. The evidence for Prakrits such as Pali (Theravada Buddhism) and Ardhamagadhi (Jainism), along with Magadhi, Maharashtri, Sinhala, Sauraseni and Niya (Gandhari), emerge in the Middle Indo-Aryan stage in two versions\u2014archaic and more formalized\u2014that may be placed in early and middle substages of the 600 BCE\u20131000 CE period.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}} Two literary Indic languages can be traced to the late Middle Indo-Aryan stage and these are Apabhramsa and Elu (a form of literary Sinhalese). Numerous North, Central, Eastern and Western Indian languages, such as Hindi, Gujarati, Sindhi, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Nepali, Braj, Awadhi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Marathi, and others belong to the New Indo-Aryan stage.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}}\n\nThere is an extensive overlap in the vocabulary, phonetics and other aspects of these New Indo-Aryan languages with Sanskrit, but it is neither universal nor identical across the languages. They likely emerged from a synthesis of the ancient Sanskrit language traditions and an admixture of various regional dialects. Each language has some unique and regionally creative aspects, with unclear origins. Prakrit languages do have a grammatical structure, but like the Vedic Sanskrit, it is far less rigorous than Classical Sanskrit. The roots of all Prakrit languages may be in the Vedic Sanskrit and ultimately the Indo-Aryan language, their structural details vary from the Classical Sanskrit.<ref name=\"Woolner1986p3\"/>{{sfn|Colin P.

The consonantal system is the same, though it systematically enlarged the inventory of distinct sounds. For example, Sanskrit added a voiceless aspirated \"t\u02b0\", to the voiceless \"t\", voiced \"d\" and voiced aspirated \"d\u02b0\" found in PIE languages.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nThe most significant and distinctive phonological development in Sanskrit is vowel-merger, states Stephanie Jamison\u2014an Indo-European linguist specializing in Sanskrit literature.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} The short ''*e'', ''*o'' and ''*a'', all merge as ''a'' (\u0905) in Sanskrit, while long ''*\u0113'', ''*\u014d'' and ''*\u0101'', all merge as long ''\u0101'' (\u0906). These mergers occurred very early and significantly impacted Sanskrit's morphological system.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} Some phonological developments in it mirror those in other PIE languages. For example, the labiovelars merged with the plain velars as in other satem languages. The secondary palatalization of the resulting segments is more thorough and systematic within Sanskrit, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} A series of retroflex dental stops were innovated in Sanskrit to more thoroughly articulate sounds for clarity. For example, unlike the loss of the morphological clarity from vowel contraction that is found in early Greek and related southeast European languages, Sanskrit deployed ''*y'', ''*w'', and ''*s'' intervocalically to provide morphological clarity.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n===Vowels===\n\nThe cardinal vowels (''svaras'') ''i'' (\u0907), ''u'' (\u0909), ''a'' (\u0905) distinguish length in Sanskrit, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}}{{sfn|Robert P. Goldman|Sally J Sutherland Goldman|2002|pp=1\u20139}} The short ''a'' (\u0905) in Sanskrit is a closer vowel than \u0101, equivalent to schwa. The mid-vowels \u0113 (\u090f) and \u014d (\u0913) in Sanskrit are monophthongizations of the Indo-Iranian diphthongs ''*ai'' and ''*au''. The Old Iranian language preserved ''*ai'' and ''*au''.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}} The Sanskrit vowels are inherently long, though often transcribed ''e'' and ''o'' without the diacritic. The vocalic liquid ''r\u0325'' in Sanskrit is a merger of PIE ''*r\u0325'' and ''*l\u0325''. The long ''r\u0325'' is an innovation and it is used in a few analogically generated morphological categories.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}}{{sfn|Michael Coulson|Richard Gombrich|James Benson|2011|pp=21\u201336}}{{sfn|Colin P.

All the retroflexes in Sanskrit are in \"origin conditioned alternants of dentals, though from the beginning of the language they have a qualified independence\", states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nRegarding the palatal plosives, the pronunciation is a matter of debate. In contemporary attestation, the palatal plosives are a regular series of palatal stops, supported by most Sanskrit sandhi rules.  However, the reflexes in descendant languages, as well as a few of the sandhi rules regarding ''ch'', could suggest an affricate pronunciation. \n\n''jh'' was a marginal phoneme in Sanskrit, hence its phonology is more difficult to reconstruct; it was more commonly employed in the Middle Indo-Aryan languages as a result of phonological processes resulting in the phoneme.\n\nThe palatal nasal is a conditioned variant of n occurring next to palatal obstruents.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}} The ''anusvara'' that Sanskrit deploys is a conditioned alternant of postvocalic nasals, under certain sandhi conditions.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}} Its ''visarga'' is a word-final or morpheme-final conditioned alternant of s and r under certain sandhi conditions.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = '''The system of Sanskrit Sounds'''<br />[The] order of Sanskrit sounds works along three principles: it goes from simple to complex; it goes from the back to the front of the mouth; and it groups similar sounds together.

Ruppel|2017|pp=18\u201319}}\n |width = 28%\n |bgcolor=#FFE0BB\n |align  = right\n}}\nThe voiceless aspirated series is also an innovation in Sanskrit but is significantly rarer than the other three series.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nWhile the Sanskrit language organizes sounds for expression beyond those found in the PIE language, it retained many features found in the Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages. An example of a similar process in all three, states Jamison, is the retroflex sibilant \u0282 being the automatic product of dental s following i, u, r, and k (mnemonically \"ruki\").{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}}\n\n===Phonological alternations, sandhi rules===\nSanskrit deploys extensive phonological alternations on different linguistic levels through ''sandhi'' rules (literally, the rules of \"putting together, union, connection, alliance\"). This is similar to the English alteration of \"going to\" as ''gonna'', states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} The Sanskrit language accepts such alterations within it, but offers formal rules for the ''sandhi'' of any two words next to each other in the same sentence or linking two sentences. The external ''sandhi'' rules state that similar short vowels coalesce into a single long vowel, while dissimilar vowels form glides or undergo diphthongization.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} Among the consonants, most external ''sandhi'' rules recommend regressive assimilation for clarity when they are voiced. According to Jamison, these rules ordinarily apply at compound seams and morpheme boundaries.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} In Vedic Sanskrit, the external ''sandhi'' rules are more variable than in Classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=11}}\n\nThe internal ''sandhi'' rules are more intricate and account for the root and the canonical structure of the Sanskrit word. These rules anticipate what are now known as the [[Bartholomae's law]] and [[Grassmann's law]]. For example, states Jamison, the \"voiceless, voiced, and voiced aspirated obstruents of a positional series regularly alternate with each other (p \u2248 b \u2248 b\u02b0; t \u2248 d \u2248 d\u02b0, etc.; note, however, c \u2248 j \u2248 h), such that, for example, a morpheme with an underlying voiced aspirate final may show alternants{{clarify|date=March 2019|reason=alternations?}} with all three stops under differing internal sandhi conditions\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=11\u201312}} The velar series (k, g, g\u02b0) alternate with the palatal series (c, j, h), while the structural position of the palatal series is modified into a retroflex cluster when followed by dental. This rule create two morphophonemically distinct series from a single palatal series.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nVocalic alternations in the Sanskrit morphological system is termed \"strengthening\", and called ''guna'' and ''vriddhi'' in the preconsonantal versions. There is an equivalence to terms deployed in Indo-European descriptive grammars, wherein Sanskrit's unstrengthened state is same as the zero-grade, ''guna'' corresponds to normal-grade, while ''vriddhi'' is same as the lengthened-state.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}} The qualitative ablaut is not found in Sanskrit just like it is absent in Iranian, but Sanskrit retains quantitative ablaut through vowel strengthening.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}} The transformations between unstrengthened to ''guna'' is prominent in the morphological system, states Jamison, while ''vriddhi'' is a particularly significant rule when adjectives of origin and appurtenance are derived. The manner in which this is done slightly differs between the Vedic and the Classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}}{{sfn|Colin P.

Similarly, the syllable may have an internal vowel of any weight. The Vedic Sanskrit shows traces of following the Sievers-Edgerton Law, but Classical Sanskrit doesn't. Vedic Sanskrit has a pitch accent system, states Jamison, which were acknowledged by Panini, but in his Classical Sanskrit the accents disappear.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} Most Vedic Sanskrit words have one accent. However, this accent is not phonologically predictable, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} It can fall anywhere in the word and its position often conveys morphological and syntactic information.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} According to Masica, the presence of an accent system in Vedic Sanskrit is evidenced from the markings in the Vedic texts. This is important because of Sanskrit's connection to the PIE languages and comparative Indo-European linguistics.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=163\u2013164}}\n\nSanskrit, like most early Indo-European languages, lost the so-called \"laryngeal consonants (cover-symbol ''*H'') present in the Proto-Indo-European\", states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} This significantly impacted the evolutionary path of the Sanskrit phonology and morphology, particularly in the variant forms of roots.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=13\u201314}}\n\n==Morphology==\n{{Main|Sanskrit grammar}}\n{{See also|Vedic Sanskrit grammar}}\nThe basis of Sanskrit morphology is the root, states Jamison, \"a morpheme bearing lexical meaning\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} The verbal and nominal stems of Sanskrit words are derived from this root through the phonological vowel-gradation processes, the addition of affixes, verbal and nominal stems. It then adds an ending to establish the grammatical and syntactic identity of the stem. According to Jamison, the \"three major formal elements of the morphology are (i) root, (ii) affix, and (iii) ending; and they are roughly responsible for (i) lexical meaning, (ii) derivation, and (iii) inflection respectively\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nA Sanskrit word has the following canonical structure:{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\n:''Root'' + ''Affix''{{su|b=0-n}} + ''Ending''{{su|b=0\u20131}}\n\nThe root structure has certain phonological constraints. Two of the most important constraints of a \"root\" is that it does not end in a short \"a\" (\u0905) and that it is monosyllabic.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} In contrast, the affixes and endings commonly do. The affixes in Sanskrit are almost always suffixes, with exceptions such as the augment \"a-\" added as prefix to past tense verb forms and the \"-na/n-\" infix in single verbal present class, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\nA verb in Sanskrit has the following canonical structure:{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}\n\n:''Root'' + ''Suffix''{{su|b=Tense-Aspect}} + ''Suffix''{{su|b=Mood}} + ''Ending''{{su|b=Personal-Number-Voice}}\n\nAccording to Ruppel, verbs in Sanskrit express the same information as other Indo-European languages such as English.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p31\"/> Sanskrit verbs describe an action or occurrence or state, its embedded morphology informs as to \"who is doing it\" (person or persons), \"when it is done\" (tense) and \"how it is done\" (mood, voice). The Indo-European languages differ in the detail. For example, the Sanskrit language attaches the affixes and ending to the verb root, while the English language adds small independent words before the verb. In Sanskrit, these elements co-exist within the word.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p31\">{{cite book|author=A. M.

The finite verbs of Classical Sanskrit have the following grammatical categories: person, number, voice, tense-aspect, and mood. According to Jamison, a portmanteau morpheme generally expresses the person-number-voice in Sanskrit, and sometimes also the ending or only the ending. The mood of the word is embedded in the affix.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nThese elements of word architecture are the typical building blocks in Classical Sanskrit, but in Vedic Sanskrit these elements fluctuate and are unclear. For example, in the ''Rigveda'' [[preverb]]s regularly occur in [[tmesis]], states Jamison, which means they are \"separated from the finite verb\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} This indecisiveness is likely linked to Vedic Sanskrit's attempt to incorporate accent. With nonfinite forms of the verb and with nominal derivatives thereof, states Jamison, \"preverbs show much clearer univerbation in Vedic, both by position and by accent, and by Classical Sanskrit, tmesis is no longer possible even with finite forms\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\nWhile roots are typical in Sanskrit, some words do not follow the canonical structure.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}} A few forms lack both inflection and root. Many words are inflected (and can enter into derivation) but lack a recognizable root. Examples from the basic vocabulary include kinship terms such as ''m\u0101tar-'' (mother), ''nas-'' (nose), ''\u015bvan-'' (dog). According to Jamison, pronouns and some words outside the semantic categories also lack roots, as do the numerals. Similarly, the Sanskrit language is flexible enough to not mandate inflection.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nThe Sanskrit words can contain more than one affix that interact with each other. Affixes in Sanskrit can be athematic as well as thematic, according to Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Athematic affixes can be alternating. Sanskrit deploys eight cases, namely nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, vocative.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nStems, that is \"root + affix\", appear in two categories in Sanskrit: vowel stems and consonant stems. Unlike some Indo-European languages such as Latin or Greek, according to Jamison, \"Sanskrit has no closed set of conventionally denoted noun declensions\". Sanskrit includes a fairly large set of stem-types.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=17\u201318}} The linguistic interaction of the roots, the phonological segments, lexical items and the grammar for the Classical Sanskrit consist of four Paninian components. These, states Paul Kiparsky, are the ''Astadhyaayi'', a comprehensive system of 4,000 grammatical rules, of which a small set are frequently used; ''Sivasutras'', an inventory of ''anubandhas'' (markers) that partition phonological segments for efficient abbreviations through the ''pratyharas'' technique; ''Dhatupatha'', a list of 2,000 verbal roots classified by their morphology and syntactic properties using diacritic markers, a structure that guides its writing systems; and, the ''Ganapatha'', an inventory of word groups, classes of lexical systems.<ref name=Kiparsky59>{{cite book|author=Paul Kiparsky|editor=E.F.K.

These differ in the types of endings and what these endings mark in the grammatical context.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}} Pronouns and nouns share the same grammatical categories, though they may differ in inflection. Verb-based adjectives and participles are not formally distinct from nouns. Adverbs are typically frozen case forms of adjectives, states Jamison, and \"nonfinite verbal forms such as infinitives and gerunds also clearly show frozen nominal case endings\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\n===Tense and voice===\nThe Sanskrit language includes five tenses: present, future, past imperfect, past [[aorist]] and past perfect.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/> It outlines three types of voices: active, passive and the middle.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/> The middle is also referred to as the mediopassive, or more formally in Sanskrit as ''parasmaipada'' (word for another) and ''atmanepada'' (word for oneself).{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60%\"\n|+Voice in Sanskrit, Stephanie Jamison{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}{{refn|group=note|Ruppel gives the following endings for the \"present indicative active\" in the Sanskrit language: 1st dual: -va\u1e25, 1st plural: -ma\u1e25, 2nd dual: -tha\u1e25, 2nd plural: -tha and so on.{{sfn|A.

For example, the ''Rigveda'' includes perfect and a marginal pluperfect. Classical Sanskrit simplifies the \"present\" system down to two tenses, the perfect and the imperfect, while the \"aorist\" stems retain the aorist tense and the \"perfect\" stems retain the perfect and marginal pluperfect.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=21}} The classical version of the language has elaborate rules for both voice and the tense-aspect system to emphasize clarity, and this is more elaborate than other Indo-European languages. The evolution of these systems can be seen from the earliest layers of the Vedic literature to the late Vedic literature.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=20\u201321}}\n\n===Gender, mood===\nSanskrit recognizes three numbers\u2014singular, dual, and plural.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} The dual is a fully functioning category, used beyond naturally paired objects such as hands or eyes, extending to any collection of two. The elliptical dual is notable in the Vedic Sanskrit, according to Jamison, where a noun in the dual signals a paired opposition.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Illustrations include ''dy\u0101v\u0101'' (literally, \"the two heavens\" for heaven-and-earth), ''m\u0101tar\u0101'' (literally, \"the two mothers\" for mother-and-father).{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} A verb may be singular, dual or plural, while the person recognized in the language are forms of \"I\", \"you\", \"he/she/it\", \"we\" and \"they\".<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/>\n\nThere are three persons in Sanskrit: first, second and third.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}} Sanskrit uses the 3\u00d73 grid formed by the three numbers and the three persons parameters as the paradigm and the basic building block of its verbal system.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nThe Sanskrit language incorporates three genders: feminine, masculine and neuter.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} All nouns have inherent gender, but with some exceptions, personal pronouns have no gender. Exceptions include demonstrative and anaphoric pronouns.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Derivation of a word is used to express the feminine. Two most common derivations come from feminine-forming suffixes, the ''-\u0101-'' (\u0906, R\u0101dh\u0101) and ''-\u012b-'' (\u0908, Rukm\u012bn\u012b). The masculine and neuter are much simpler, and the difference between them is primarily inflectional.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}}{{sfn|Robert P. Goldman| Sally J Sutherland Goldman|2002|pp=59, 79, 91, 113}} Similar affixes for the feminine are found in many Indo-European languages, states Burrow, suggesting links of the Sanskrit to its PIE heritage.{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|pp= 191\u2013194}}\n\nPronouns in Sanskrit include the personal pronouns of the first and second persons, unmarked for gender, and a larger number of gender-distinguishing pronouns and adjectives.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}} Examples of the former include ''ah\u00e1m'' (first singular), ''vay\u00e1m'' (first plural) and ''y\u016by\u00e1m'' (second plural). The latter can be demonstrative, deictic or anaphoric.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}} Both the Vedic and Classical Sanskrit share the ''s\u00e1/t\u00e1m'' pronominal stem, and this is the closest element to a third person pronoun and an article in the Sanskrit language, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nIndicative, potential and imperative are the three mood forms in Sanskrit.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/>\n\n===Prosody, meter===\n{{main|Sanskrit prosody}}\nThe Sanskrit language formally incorporates [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metres]].<ref name=jameslochtefeldsca140/> By the late Vedic era, this developed into a field of study and it was central to the composition of the Hindu literature including the later Vedic texts.

Further, a closer examination reveals that they all have the similar basic graphic principles, the same ''varnamala'' (literally, \"garland of letters\") alphabetic ordering following the same logical phonetic order, easing the work of historic skilled scribes writing or reproducing Sanskrit works across the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|pp=70\u201371, 75\u201376 in Chapter 3 by Salomon}}{{refn|group=note|Salomon states that these shared graphic principles that combine syllabic and alphabetic writing are distinctive for Indic scripts when contrasted with other major world languages.

The system most commonly used today is the IAST ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]]), which has been the academic standard since 1888. [[ASCII]]-based transliteration schemes have also evolved because of difficulties representing Sanskrit characters in computer systems. These include [[Harvard-Kyoto]] and [[ITRANS]], a transliteration scheme that is used widely on the Internet, especially in Usenet and in email, for considerations of speed of entry as well as rendering issues. With the wide availability of [[Unicode]]-aware web browsers, IAST has become common online. It is also possible to type using an [[alphanumeric keyboard]] and transliterate to Devanagari using software like Mac OS X's international support.\n\nEuropean scholars in the 19th century generally preferred Devanagari for the transcription and reproduction of whole texts and lengthy excerpts. However, references to individual words and names in texts composed in European Languages were usually represented with Roman transliteration. From the 20th century onwards, because of production costs, textual editions edited by Western scholars have mostly been in [[Romanised]] transliteration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shashir.autodidactus.org/shashir_umich/sanskrit_transcription.html|title=Modern Transcription of Sanskrit|publisher=autodidactus.org}}</ref>\n\n===Epigraphy===\nThe earliest known stone inscriptions in Sanskrit are in the Brahmi script from the first century BCE.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=86\u201387}}{{refn|group=note|Some scholars date these to the 2nd century BCE.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jan Gonda|authorlink=Jan Gonda|title=Visnuism and Sivaism: A Comparison|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khrmDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA166|year=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-4742-8082-2|pages=166 note 243}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=James Hegarty|title=Religion, Narrative and Public Imagination in South Asia: Past and Place in the Sanskrit Mahabharata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMSoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-64589-1|pages=46 note 118}}</ref>}}{{refn|group=note|Prakrit inscriptions of ancient India, such as those of Ashoka, are older.

Pata\u00f1jali acknowledged that Prakrit is the first language, one instinctively adopted by every child with all its imperfections and later leads to the problems of interpretation and misunderstanding. The purifying structure of the Sanskrit language removes these imperfections. The early Sanskrit grammarian [[Da\u1e47\u1e0din]] states, for example, that much in the Prakrit languages is etymologically rooted in Sanskrit, but involve \"loss of sounds\" and corruptions that result from a \"disregard of the grammar\". Da\u1e47\u1e0din acknowledged that there are words and confusing structures in Prakrit that thrive independent of Sanskrit.

There is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the Gothick and the Celtick [sic], though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the Sanscrit; and the Old Persian might be added to the same family.\n|William Jones, 1786|quoted by Thomas Burrow in ''The Sanskrit Language''{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|p=6}}}}\n\nIn order to explain the common features shared by Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages, the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory]] states that the original speakers of what became Sanskrit arrived in the Indian subcontinent from the north-west sometime during the early second millennium BCE. Evidence for such a theory includes the close relationship between the Indo-Iranian tongues and the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages]], vocabulary exchange with the non-Indo-European [[Uralic languages]], and the nature of the attested Indo-European words for flora and fauna.{{sfn|Colin P.

A part of the difficulty is the lack of sufficient textual, archaeological and epigraphical evidence for the ancient Prakrit languages with rare exceptions such as Pali, leading to a tendency of [[anachronism|anachronistic]] errors.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}} Sanskrit and Prakrit languages may be divided into Old Indo-Aryan (1500 BCE\u2013600 BCE), Middle Indo-Aryan (600 BCE\u20131000 CE) and New Indo-Aryan (1000 CE\u2013current), each can further be subdivided in early, middle or second, and late evolutionary substages.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}}\n\nVedic Sanskrit belongs to the early Old Indo-Aryan while Classical Sanskrit to the later Old Indo-Aryan stage. The evidence for Prakrits such as Pali (Theravada Buddhism) and Ardhamagadhi (Jainism), along with Magadhi, Maharashtri, Sinhala, Sauraseni and Niya (Gandhari), emerge in the Middle Indo-Aryan stage in two versions\u2014archaic and more formalized\u2014that may be placed in early and middle substages of the 600 BCE\u20131000 CE period.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}} Two literary Indic languages can be traced to the late Middle Indo-Aryan stage and these are Apabhramsa and Elu (a form of literary Sinhalese). Numerous North, Central, Eastern and Western Indian languages, such as Hindi, Gujarati, Sindhi, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Nepali, Braj, Awadhi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Marathi, and others belong to the New Indo-Aryan stage.{{sfn|Colin P.

They likely emerged from a synthesis of the ancient Sanskrit language traditions and an admixture of various regional dialects. Each language has some unique and regionally creative aspects, with unclear origins. Prakrit languages do have a grammatical structure, but like the Vedic Sanskrit, it is far less rigorous than Classical Sanskrit.

The consonantal system is the same, though it systematically enlarged the inventory of distinct sounds. For example, Sanskrit added a voiceless aspirated \"t\u02b0\", to the voiceless \"t\", voiced \"d\" and voiced aspirated \"d\u02b0\" found in PIE languages.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nThe most significant and distinctive phonological development in Sanskrit is vowel-merger, states Stephanie Jamison\u2014an Indo-European linguist specializing in Sanskrit literature.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} The short ''*e'', ''*o'' and ''*a'', all merge as ''a'' (\u0905) in Sanskrit, while long ''*\u0113'', ''*\u014d'' and ''*\u0101'', all merge as long ''\u0101'' (\u0906). These mergers occurred very early and significantly impacted Sanskrit's morphological system.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} Some phonological developments in it mirror those in other PIE languages. For example, the labiovelars merged with the plain velars as in other satem languages. The secondary palatalization of the resulting segments is more thorough and systematic within Sanskrit, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} A series of retroflex dental stops were innovated in Sanskrit to more thoroughly articulate sounds for clarity. For example, unlike the loss of the morphological clarity from vowel contraction that is found in early Greek and related southeast European languages, Sanskrit deployed ''*y'', ''*w'', and ''*s'' intervocalically to provide morphological clarity.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n===Vowels===\n\nThe cardinal vowels (''svaras'') ''i'' (\u0907), ''u'' (\u0909), ''a'' (\u0905) distinguish length in Sanskrit, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}}{{sfn|Robert P. Goldman|Sally J Sutherland Goldman|2002|pp=1\u20139}} The short ''a'' (\u0905) in Sanskrit is a closer vowel than \u0101, equivalent to schwa. The mid-vowels \u0113 (\u090f) and \u014d (\u0913) in Sanskrit are monophthongizations of the Indo-Iranian diphthongs ''*ai'' and ''*au''. The Old Iranian language preserved ''*ai'' and ''*au''.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}} The Sanskrit vowels are inherently long, though often transcribed ''e'' and ''o'' without the diacritic. The vocalic liquid ''r\u0325'' in Sanskrit is a merger of PIE ''*r\u0325'' and ''*l\u0325''. The long ''r\u0325'' is an innovation and it is used in a few analogically generated morphological categories.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}}{{sfn|Michael Coulson|Richard Gombrich|James Benson|2011|pp=21\u201336}}{{sfn|Colin P.

All the retroflexes in Sanskrit are in \"origin conditioned alternants of dentals, though from the beginning of the language they have a qualified independence\", states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nRegarding the palatal plosives, the pronunciation is a matter of debate. In contemporary attestation, the palatal plosives are a regular series of palatal stops, supported by most Sanskrit sandhi rules.  However, the reflexes in descendant languages, as well as a few of the sandhi rules regarding ''ch'', could suggest an affricate pronunciation. \n\n''jh'' was a marginal phoneme in Sanskrit, hence its phonology is more difficult to reconstruct; it was more commonly employed in the Middle Indo-Aryan languages as a result of phonological processes resulting in the phoneme.\n\nThe palatal nasal is a conditioned variant of n occurring next to palatal obstruents.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}} The ''anusvara'' that Sanskrit deploys is a conditioned alternant of postvocalic nasals, under certain sandhi conditions.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}} Its ''visarga'' is a word-final or morpheme-final conditioned alternant of s and r under certain sandhi conditions.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = '''The system of Sanskrit Sounds'''<br />[The] order of Sanskrit sounds works along three principles: it goes from simple to complex; it goes from the back to the front of the mouth; and it groups similar sounds together. [...] Among themselves, both the vowels and consonants are ordered according to where in the mouth they are pronounced, going from back to front.\n |source = \u2014 A. M.

Ruppel|2017|pp=18\u201319}}\n |width = 28%\n |bgcolor=#FFE0BB\n |align  = right\n}}\nThe voiceless aspirated series is also an innovation in Sanskrit but is significantly rarer than the other three series.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nWhile the Sanskrit language organizes sounds for expression beyond those found in the PIE language, it retained many features found in the Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages. An example of a similar process in all three, states Jamison, is the retroflex sibilant \u0282 being the automatic product of dental s following i, u, r, and k (mnemonically \"ruki\").{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}}\n\n===Phonological alternations, sandhi rules===\nSanskrit deploys extensive phonological alternations on different linguistic levels through ''sandhi'' rules (literally, the rules of \"putting together, union, connection, alliance\"). This is similar to the English alteration of \"going to\" as ''gonna'', states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} The Sanskrit language accepts such alterations within it, but offers formal rules for the ''sandhi'' of any two words next to each other in the same sentence or linking two sentences. The external ''sandhi'' rules state that similar short vowels coalesce into a single long vowel, while dissimilar vowels form glides or undergo diphthongization.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} Among the consonants, most external ''sandhi'' rules recommend regressive assimilation for clarity when they are voiced. According to Jamison, these rules ordinarily apply at compound seams and morpheme boundaries.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} In Vedic Sanskrit, the external ''sandhi'' rules are more variable than in Classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=11}}\n\nThe internal ''sandhi'' rules are more intricate and account for the root and the canonical structure of the Sanskrit word. These rules anticipate what are now known as the [[Bartholomae's law]] and [[Grassmann's law]]. For example, states Jamison, the \"voiceless, voiced, and voiced aspirated obstruents of a positional series regularly alternate with each other (p \u2248 b \u2248 b\u02b0; t \u2248 d \u2248 d\u02b0, etc.; note, however, c \u2248 j \u2248 h), such that, for example, a morpheme with an underlying voiced aspirate final may show alternants{{clarify|date=March 2019|reason=alternations?}} with all three stops under differing internal sandhi conditions\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=11\u201312}} The velar series (k, g, g\u02b0) alternate with the palatal series (c, j, h), while the structural position of the palatal series is modified into a retroflex cluster when followed by dental. This rule create two morphophonemically distinct series from a single palatal series.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nVocalic alternations in the Sanskrit morphological system is termed \"strengthening\", and called ''guna'' and ''vriddhi'' in the preconsonantal versions. There is an equivalence to terms deployed in Indo-European descriptive grammars, wherein Sanskrit's unstrengthened state is same as the zero-grade, ''guna'' corresponds to normal-grade, while ''vriddhi'' is same as the lengthened-state.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}} The qualitative ablaut is not found in Sanskrit just like it is absent in Iranian, but Sanskrit retains quantitative ablaut through vowel strengthening.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}} The transformations between unstrengthened to ''guna'' is prominent in the morphological system, states Jamison, while ''vriddhi'' is a particularly significant rule when adjectives of origin and appurtenance are derived. The manner in which this is done slightly differs between the Vedic and the Classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}}{{sfn|Colin P.

Similarly, the syllable may have an internal vowel of any weight. The Vedic Sanskrit shows traces of following the Sievers-Edgerton Law, but Classical Sanskrit doesn't. Vedic Sanskrit has a pitch accent system, states Jamison, which were acknowledged by Panini, but in his Classical Sanskrit the accents disappear.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} Most Vedic Sanskrit words have one accent. However, this accent is not phonologically predictable, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} It can fall anywhere in the word and its position often conveys morphological and syntactic information.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} According to Masica, the presence of an accent system in Vedic Sanskrit is evidenced from the markings in the Vedic texts. This is important because of Sanskrit's connection to the PIE languages and comparative Indo-European linguistics.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=163\u2013164}}\n\nSanskrit, like most early Indo-European languages, lost the so-called \"laryngeal consonants (cover-symbol ''*H'') present in the Proto-Indo-European\", states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} This significantly impacted the evolutionary path of the Sanskrit phonology and morphology, particularly in the variant forms of roots.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=13\u201314}}\n\n==Morphology==\n{{Main|Sanskrit grammar}}\n{{See also|Vedic Sanskrit grammar}}\nThe basis of Sanskrit morphology is the root, states Jamison, \"a morpheme bearing lexical meaning\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} The verbal and nominal stems of Sanskrit words are derived from this root through the phonological vowel-gradation processes, the addition of affixes, verbal and nominal stems. It then adds an ending to establish the grammatical and syntactic identity of the stem. According to Jamison, the \"three major formal elements of the morphology are (i) root, (ii) affix, and (iii) ending; and they are roughly responsible for (i) lexical meaning, (ii) derivation, and (iii) inflection respectively\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nA Sanskrit word has the following canonical structure:{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\n:''Root'' + ''Affix''{{su|b=0-n}} + ''Ending''{{su|b=0\u20131}}\n\nThe root structure has certain phonological constraints. Two of the most important constraints of a \"root\" is that it does not end in a short \"a\" (\u0905) and that it is monosyllabic.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} In contrast, the affixes and endings commonly do. The affixes in Sanskrit are almost always suffixes, with exceptions such as the augment \"a-\" added as prefix to past tense verb forms and the \"-na/n-\" infix in single verbal present class, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\nA verb in Sanskrit has the following canonical structure:{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}\n\n:''Root'' + ''Suffix''{{su|b=Tense-Aspect}} + ''Suffix''{{su|b=Mood}} + ''Ending''{{su|b=Personal-Number-Voice}}\n\nAccording to Ruppel, verbs in Sanskrit express the same information as other Indo-European languages such as English.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p31\"/> Sanskrit verbs describe an action or occurrence or state, its embedded morphology informs as to \"who is doing it\" (person or persons), \"when it is done\" (tense) and \"how it is done\" (mood, voice). The Indo-European languages differ in the detail. For example, the Sanskrit language attaches the affixes and ending to the verb root, while the English language adds small independent words before the verb. In Sanskrit, these elements co-exist within the word.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p31\">{{cite book|author=A. M.

The finite verbs of Classical Sanskrit have the following grammatical categories: person, number, voice, tense-aspect, and mood. According to Jamison, a portmanteau morpheme generally expresses the person-number-voice in Sanskrit, and sometimes also the ending or only the ending. The mood of the word is embedded in the affix.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nThese elements of word architecture are the typical building blocks in Classical Sanskrit, but in Vedic Sanskrit these elements fluctuate and are unclear. For example, in the ''Rigveda'' [[preverb]]s regularly occur in [[tmesis]], states Jamison, which means they are \"separated from the finite verb\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} This indecisiveness is likely linked to Vedic Sanskrit's attempt to incorporate accent. With nonfinite forms of the verb and with nominal derivatives thereof, states Jamison, \"preverbs show much clearer univerbation in Vedic, both by position and by accent, and by Classical Sanskrit, tmesis is no longer possible even with finite forms\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\nWhile roots are typical in Sanskrit, some words do not follow the canonical structure.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}} A few forms lack both inflection and root. Many words are inflected (and can enter into derivation) but lack a recognizable root. Examples from the basic vocabulary include kinship terms such as ''m\u0101tar-'' (mother), ''nas-'' (nose), ''\u015bvan-'' (dog). According to Jamison, pronouns and some words outside the semantic categories also lack roots, as do the numerals. Similarly, the Sanskrit language is flexible enough to not mandate inflection.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nThe Sanskrit words can contain more than one affix that interact with each other. Affixes in Sanskrit can be athematic as well as thematic, according to Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Athematic affixes can be alternating. Sanskrit deploys eight cases, namely nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, vocative.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nStems, that is \"root + affix\", appear in two categories in Sanskrit: vowel stems and consonant stems. Unlike some Indo-European languages such as Latin or Greek, according to Jamison, \"Sanskrit has no closed set of conventionally denoted noun declensions\". Sanskrit includes a fairly large set of stem-types.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=17\u201318}} The linguistic interaction of the roots, the phonological segments, lexical items and the grammar for the Classical Sanskrit consist of four Paninian components. These, states Paul Kiparsky, are the ''Astadhyaayi'', a comprehensive system of 4,000 grammatical rules, of which a small set are frequently used; ''Sivasutras'', an inventory of ''anubandhas'' (markers) that partition phonological segments for efficient abbreviations through the ''pratyharas'' technique; ''Dhatupatha'', a list of 2,000 verbal roots classified by their morphology and syntactic properties using diacritic markers, a structure that guides its writing systems; and, the ''Ganapatha'', an inventory of word groups, classes of lexical systems.<ref name=Kiparsky59>{{cite book|author=Paul Kiparsky|editor=E.F.K.

These differ in the types of endings and what these endings mark in the grammatical context.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}} Pronouns and nouns share the same grammatical categories, though they may differ in inflection. Verb-based adjectives and participles are not formally distinct from nouns. Adverbs are typically frozen case forms of adjectives, states Jamison, and \"nonfinite verbal forms such as infinitives and gerunds also clearly show frozen nominal case endings\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\n===Tense and voice===\nThe Sanskrit language includes five tenses: present, future, past imperfect, past [[aorist]] and past perfect.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/> It outlines three types of voices: active, passive and the middle.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/> The middle is also referred to as the mediopassive, or more formally in Sanskrit as ''parasmaipada'' (word for another) and ''atmanepada'' (word for oneself).{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60%\"\n|+Voice in Sanskrit, Stephanie Jamison{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}{{refn|group=note|Ruppel gives the following endings for the \"present indicative active\" in the Sanskrit language: 1st dual: -va\u1e25, 1st plural: -ma\u1e25, 2nd dual: -tha\u1e25, 2nd plural: -tha and so on.{{sfn|A.

For example, the ''Rigveda'' includes perfect and a marginal pluperfect. Classical Sanskrit simplifies the \"present\" system down to two tenses, the perfect and the imperfect, while the \"aorist\" stems retain the aorist tense and the \"perfect\" stems retain the perfect and marginal pluperfect.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=21}} The classical version of the language has elaborate rules for both voice and the tense-aspect system to emphasize clarity, and this is more elaborate than other Indo-European languages. The evolution of these systems can be seen from the earliest layers of the Vedic literature to the late Vedic literature.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=20\u201321}}\n\n===Gender, mood===\nSanskrit recognizes three numbers\u2014singular, dual, and plural.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} The dual is a fully functioning category, used beyond naturally paired objects such as hands or eyes, extending to any collection of two. The elliptical dual is notable in the Vedic Sanskrit, according to Jamison, where a noun in the dual signals a paired opposition.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Illustrations include ''dy\u0101v\u0101'' (literally, \"the two heavens\" for heaven-and-earth), ''m\u0101tar\u0101'' (literally, \"the two mothers\" for mother-and-father).{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} A verb may be singular, dual or plural, while the person recognized in the language are forms of \"I\", \"you\", \"he/she/it\", \"we\" and \"they\".<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/>\n\nThere are three persons in Sanskrit: first, second and third.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}} Sanskrit uses the 3\u00d73 grid formed by the three numbers and the three persons parameters as the paradigm and the basic building block of its verbal system.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nThe Sanskrit language incorporates three genders: feminine, masculine and neuter.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} All nouns have inherent gender, but with some exceptions, personal pronouns have no gender. Exceptions include demonstrative and anaphoric pronouns.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Derivation of a word is used to express the feminine. Two most common derivations come from feminine-forming suffixes, the ''-\u0101-'' (\u0906, R\u0101dh\u0101) and ''-\u012b-'' (\u0908, Rukm\u012bn\u012b). The masculine and neuter are much simpler, and the difference between them is primarily inflectional.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}}{{sfn|Robert P. Goldman| Sally J Sutherland Goldman|2002|pp=59, 79, 91, 113}} Similar affixes for the feminine are found in many Indo-European languages, states Burrow, suggesting links of the Sanskrit to its PIE heritage.{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|pp= 191\u2013194}}\n\nPronouns in Sanskrit include the personal pronouns of the first and second persons, unmarked for gender, and a larger number of gender-distinguishing pronouns and adjectives.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}} Examples of the former include ''ah\u00e1m'' (first singular), ''vay\u00e1m'' (first plural) and ''y\u016by\u00e1m'' (second plural). The latter can be demonstrative, deictic or anaphoric.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}} Both the Vedic and Classical Sanskrit share the ''s\u00e1/t\u00e1m'' pronominal stem, and this is the closest element to a third person pronoun and an article in the Sanskrit language, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nIndicative, potential and imperative are the three mood forms in Sanskrit.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/>\n\n===Prosody, meter===\n{{main|Sanskrit prosody}}\nThe Sanskrit language formally incorporates [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metres]].<ref name=jameslochtefeldsca140/> By the late Vedic era, this developed into a field of study and it was central to the composition of the Hindu literature including the later Vedic texts.

Starting as a sex therapist and feminist, she came to public prominence in the 1970s, establishing a career in publishing and broadcasting as well as writing several books. In the last two decades she has abandoned feminism and attracted controversy with her social commentary and her views on sexual abuse, domestic violence and men's rights advocacy.\n\n== Early life ==\nArndt was born in [[Penrith, England]], to the economist [[Heinz Wolfgang Arndt|Heinz Arndt]] (1915 \u2013 6 May 2002) and Ruth (''n\u00e9e'' Strohsahl) (20 March 1915 \u2013 20 March 2001), the youngest of three children.<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/> Her parents were German, and escaped Nazi Germany prior to WWII.<ref name=\"father\"/> They emigrated to Australia in 1945 and she grew up in [[Canberra]].<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1971, after completing a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at the [[Australian National University]], Arndt moved to [[Sydney]] and studied at the [[University of New South Wales]] where she completed a [[Master of Psychology]] degree in 1973;<ref name=\"rats\" /><ref name=\"quals\"/> her thesis was on orgasm dysfunction.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"Overington\"/>\n\n== Family ==\nSince graduating, Arndt has predominantly lived in [[Woollahra]] in the eastern-suburbs of Sydney [[New South Wales]]. She was first married to journalist Dennis Minogue in 1977, who died in 1981. Arndt and Minoque were business partners during this time. Her second marriage was to American corporate lawyer Warren Scott in 1986, and they divorced in 2007. During the years 1986 to 1991 she lived with Scott in the borough of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]] NY. Arndt has three children of her own, two girls and one boy.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"sexpert\"/><ref name=\"marries\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduation, Arndt practiced as a [[sex therapist]] until 1981.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She describes herself as \"one of Australia's first sex therapists\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/>\n\nArndt came to prominence in the 1970s by editing ''Forum'', an Australian adult sex education magazine, which led to frequent radio and television appearances. She was appointed editor in 1974 and remained in the position until July 1982.<ref name=\"advocate\"/> The publication proved controversial in conservative circles, and in [[Queensland Parliament]] in 1977 MP [[Des Frawley]] said: \"It is a dirty, filthy magazine\".<ref name=\"hansard\"/> [[Queensland Police Service|Queensland police]] also raided a newsagent, seizing copies of the magazine, requesting the proprietor [[show cause]].<ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\nBetween 1973 and 1976 the [[Australian Broadcasting Control Board]] had ruled, without explanation, that all TV and radio programs in which Arndt takes part in be pre-recorded so that they may be approved by station management before being transmitted.<ref name=\"abt\" /><ref name=\"tharunka\" />\n\nIn 1978 Arndt said that \"The sexual revolution has been a [[damp squib]]\" expressing some doubts about what level people were really more sophisticated in their attitudes toward sex. She did acknowledge that the The [[Women's Movement]] had made physiological discoveries about the sexuality of women, that there was more tolerance to one's [[sexual preference]], and there had been a recognition of the importance of sex for [[senior citizens]] and those with [[disabilities]]. Arndt also praised the introduction of [[South Australian]] laws criminalising [[rape]] within marriage.<ref name=\"noisy\"/>\n\nHer work in sex education also involved postgraduate courses, seminars and lectures for groups including doctors and other professionals. Following the death of her husband and business partner, Dennis Minogue, in 1981, ''Forum'' magazine closed.<ref name=\"advocate\" /> In the mid 1980s, Arndt wrote for ''[[Australian Playboy]]''<ref name=\"tharunka\"/> and also wrote about broader social issues for newspapers including ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. During this period Arndt also had her own radio program on [[2GB]] and regular radio segments in major cities all over Australia. In 1982 she appeared on the TV panel-show series ''[[Beauty and the Beast (talk show)|Beauty and the Beast]]''<ref name=\"beauty\" /> and, from 1981 to 1986, was a weekly guest on television program ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|The Today Show]]''.<ref name=\"cv2011\" />\n\nIn 1984, Arndt ran a mail-order lingerie and sex toy business and authored a number of books on sex advice, including ''The Bettina Arndt Guide to Lovemaking for Women'', in which she wrote that \"Looking at what's happening to men and women in bed today, it wouldn't surprise me at all if more and more males chose to stick to their beer. Sex is fast becoming a battlefield, with women calling more of the shots.\"<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nIn 1986 Arndt moved to New York City for five years and, while living in the United States, wrote a weekly newspaper column syndicated through ''The Age'' in [[Melbourne]] (and published in Canberra, [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]] and [[Brisbane]]). She had two books published featuring collections of her writings, ''Private Lives'' (1985) and ''All About Us'' (1989).<ref name=\"sexpert\"/> In 1991, Arndt returned with her family to live in Australia.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nFrom the 1990s onward Arndt wrote a personal advice column for ''[[Cleo (magazine)|Cleo magazine]]'',<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> wrote for ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'',<ref name=\"Talking\"/> ''[[The Australian]]'' and ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]''. She was a guest reporter on ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' on [[ABC TV (Australia)|ABC TV]]<ref name=\"gg\"/> and a regular guest on [[ABC Local Radio|ABC radio]] in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She was on the board of the [[Australian National University]] and was the president of the board of the [[Royal Women's Hospital]] Foundation in 1999. She also served as an online dating coach from 2001 to 2017,<ref name=\"gg\"/> and more recently has assisted men in writing their dating profiles and referring them on to good photographers for their dating profile photos.<ref name=\"could be\"/>\n\nDuring the first half of her career Arndt was a [[feminist]], but since the mid 1990s<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> has turned to men's rights advocacy.<ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> Her later work encapsulated socially conservative ideas about relationships and family structures.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"advocate\"/> In 2010, Arndt said, \"I spent my early career lobbying for women but turned to men when I realised how lousy they are about advocating for issues that affect their private lives.\"<ref name=\"Overington\"/> Kate Gleeson, a senior lecturer at [[Macquarie Law School]] who has studied her, says \"Arndt's extolling of men's rights, as well as her critique of feminist analyses of domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual harassment and sex within marriage, has provoked feminist ire in the press\", adding \"To Arndt's frustration, the male revolution she advocated of political reaction against feminism had failed to emerge\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nDuring the conservative [[Howard Government]] (1996-2007) Arndt was brought into the fold as an adviser on issues such as assisted reproduction, education and child support.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> She served on a number of committees advising the Australian Government on policy matters, including the National Advisory Committee on Ageing (2003), the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Review Team (2005) and the Child Support Review Reference Group (2004).<ref name=\"gg\"/> In 2003 the government awarded her the [[Centenary Medal]], which recognises \"people who made a contribution to Australian society or government.\".<ref name=\"cv2011\"/><ref name=\"centenary-medal\"/> Gleeson observed that at this time Arndt had a \"persistent criticism of matters of [[family law]]\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> A government committee she was part of from 2000 to 2001, the Family Law Pathways Advisory Group, was instrumental in later redrafting Australian family law.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/>\n\nIn 2007, the Australian television program ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' demonstrated that a newspaper article written by Arndt for the ''[[Brisbane Courier Mail]]'' plagiarised large tracts of a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article by [[Dick Taverne]] published three years earlier.<ref name=\"leftovers\"/> The program also accused Arndt of journalistic non-disclosure in a column she wrote for ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' when she identified [[Kerryn Phelps]]'s same-sex marriage to [[Ascham School|Ascham Girls' School]] teacher Jackie Stricker. Arndt failed to disclose that her daughter attended the school and Phelps holds Arndt partly responsible for ending her wife's career there. In her defence Arndt said that \"I've never been anti-gay\", saying she was merely reporting the anxieties of some Ascham parents.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nArndt wrote ''The Sex Diaries'', based on the diaries of 98 couples talking about how they negotiate sex and deal with mismatched desire. It was published in 2009, followed by ''What Men Want'', another diary project published in September 2010.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"blokes\"/>\n\nIn 2010, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald#Good Weekend|Good Weekend]]'' said she had repositioned herself as \"a champion of the downtrodden male of the species\", adding that \"In her writing, the former libertine started to sound like a self-appointed guardian of public morals.\" Her friend Merri Southwood said of Arndt's newspaper columns at the time, \"I'm not sure how much of it is the author seeking an audience and how much is the genuine Bettina ... Because, in fact, the way she writes is sometimes a little at odds with her own personal life.\"<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nIn 2020 Arndt's previously good relationship with political conservatives and the conservative media shifted. ''Media Watch'' reported that \"Arndt has been in the media for more than 40 years and has written for many of Australia's leading papers and magazines as sex therapist, [[social commentator]] and, most recently, outspoken men's rights advocate\". But her comments on the [[murder of Hannah Clarke]] incident in 2020 had since led to near universal condemnation in the media, including those she had previously worked with. ''Media Watch'' questioned whether or not they would use her again in the future.<ref name=\"condemned\"/> When questioned about Arndt's time advising the Howard Government (1996-2007), Victorian [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] shadow minister [[Tim Smith (Australian politician)|Tim Smith]] said: \"I think Bettina Arndt has become more extreme as the years have gone by. I don't think she was nearly this extreme during the Howard Government years. I think some of her commentary of recent years has gone beyond mainstream Australia to the fringes.\"<ref name=\"crossed\"/> [[News Corp Australia|News Corp's]] [[David Penberthy]] lamented the loss of the Arndt of the 70s and 80s when she was a sex therapist and a \"fun person... trying to make couples happier through sex\", saying she seems to have now \"herded all of the really angry guys in Australia into the one corner and has, sort of, created almost a business model out of it\".<ref name=\"storm\"/>\n\n===Men's rights activism===\nArndt has now been termed a [[men's rights activist]],<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> and says \"we need to start calling out feminism which is a really destructive force in our society\".<ref name=\"condemned\"/> She believes there is a pervasive \"anti-male bias\" in society, media and the law - also extending into in areas such as divorce, cancer research and domestic violence - saying that women are prioritised, thus denying men their rights.<ref name=\"toxic\"/> In 2012, [[Janet Albrechtsen|Albrechtsen]] wrote that Arndt \"now argues that with women dominating public discussion of gender and sexual issues, men's views are being silenced\".<ref name=\"Albrechtsen\"/> Arndt argues that \"[[radical feminism]], where men are presented as violent and sexist, is guilty of manshaming and destroying what should be a bond of mutual acceptance and respect between the sexes\".<ref name=\"toxic\"/> Arndt has been accused of being hostile towards women.<ref name=\"storm\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/> Author [[Susan Maushart]] says that Arndt \"seems, for whatever reason, to not like women very much\".<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\n===On partnerships and parenting===\nWhen Australia's first female prime minister, [[Julia Gillard]] (Labor), was elected in 2010, Arndt criticised the new prime minister for setting a bad example by living in a [[Common-law marriage|de facto]] relationship, or as Arndt described it \"marriage lite\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nArndt has been criticised for dismissing genuine academic research when writing about the children of [[LGBTIQ]] parents. Ex Federal Senator [[Brian Greig]] denounced Arndt for using \"the work of 'researchers' with strong links to the American religious right\" when discussing [[same-sex parenting]], saying she should have been \"able to distinguish such research from sham, politically motivated studies.\"<ref name=\"qnews\"/>\n\n===Comments about sexual abuse===\nArndt has drawn controversy over several incidents in which she has been accused of downplaying the [[sexual abuse]] of children by adults.\n\nShe has suggested that rape is not always violent and has said that most children do not incur long-term damage from sexual assault.<ref name=\"silence\"/>\n\nIn 1997, Arndt defended a doctor who had molested a 12-year-old child and other patients including herself,<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> arguing that he should not be charged because in another context masturbation would have been \"a loving and pleasurable act\".<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn 2005, in an article in ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', Arndt discussed convicted [[paedophile]] Robert Potter, a scoutmaster who had molested four boys, one of whom subsequently attempted suicide. She described Potter as \"a good bloke\"<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> and argued that \"such minor abuse rarely has lasting consequences\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn a 2012 article she wrote that \"Demonising sexuality inevitably distorts a proper perspective on sexual crimes, leading to politically inspired calls for absurdly longer sentences, misinformation about the likelihood of offenders to reoffend and exaggeration of the emotional damage to the victims of minor abuse\" and that \"Our prurient interest in sex crimes often robs the perpetrator of any chance of redemption - as the sad death of cricket commentator [[Peter Roebuck]] bears witness.\"<ref name=\"prudes\"/>\n \nIn 2017, Arndt conducted a 17-minute interview for her YouTube channel with Nicolaas Bester, a high school teacher in [[Tasmania]] who in 2011 was sentenced to two years and 10 months jail for sexual assault,<ref name=\"urges\" /> maintaining a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old student<ref name=\"jailed\"/> and possessing child pornography.<ref name=\"ironic\"/> He was subsequently jailed again for producing child exploitation material<ref name=\"awesome\"/><ref name=\"silent\"/> and bragging that the sexual abuse had been \"awesome\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/> In the video, Arndt referred to \"sexually provocative behaviour from female students\" and said young women should \"behave sensibly and not exploit their seductive power to ruin the lives of men\". Bester's victim subsequently criticised Arndt for supporting Bester and accusing her of trivialising his crime,<ref name=\"arndt awarded\"/> saying there \"was no evidence of my provocative behaviour\". \"Not only is the interview disturbing because it gives a platform to a paedophile. It's not a truthful interview.\"<ref name=\"survivor\"/> Arndt was criticised for not seeking out the victim for her side of the story.<ref name=\"4bc\"/><ref name=\"ironic\" /> Following widespread public outrage, Arndt apologised for her tone and said her interview was in poor taste, but in a later interview said of Bester that \"He is not a [[pederast]]. He is not preying on kids.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/>\n\n===Domestic violence===\nArndt is a champion of male victims of [[domestic violence]] who have been abused by women and has said that the \"real picture\" of domestic violence is \"where our official evidence shows at least a third of the victims are male\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/><ref name=\"bring\"/> Arndt is an advocate for the purported statistical claim that \"one in three\" male victims of domestic violence have been abused by women.<ref name=\"no evidence\"/><ref name=\"fiction\"/> Jacinta Masters, from Gender Equity Victoria, says the statistics Arndt uses have \"been roundly dismissed by experts as inaccurate and a misrepresentation\".<ref name=\"no evidence\"/> Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety (ANROWS) says Arndt's \"claims: 1) are inaccurate; and 2) appear to be more focussed on undermining the gains made to address violence against women, than genuine concern for men subjected to violence.\"<ref name=\"anrows\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) states that Arndt \"has, for many years, been downplaying domestic violence - even in her language, she uses terms like the 'myth of domestic violence' and 'feminist narrative', so while we're trying to highlight it as a problem, she's casting doubt and doing the opposite of that.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/>\n\nArndt is a critic of domestic violence campaigner [[Rosie Batty]], saying that her campaigning \"denies women's role in family violence\" and that Batty has been \"playing the feminist puppet\".<ref name=\"mumbrella\"/>\n\t\nArndt defended a comment by a Queensland police officer that a man who had killed his wife and children by [[Death by burning|immolation]] may have been a \"husband being driven too far by issues\".<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"examines\"/><ref name=\"reece\"/>\n\n===2018 \"fake rape crisis\" campus tour===\nArndt says that there is a \"manufactured rape crisis\" on Australian university campuses fuelled by the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]], where the institutions convene a \"[[kangaroo court]]\" once an allegation has been made where the male alleged to have raped the female has no chance of defence.<ref name=\"bias\"/> In 2018-2019 she conducted her \"fake rape crisis\" university campus tour where she campaigned against changes to consent laws with her main argument being that rates of sexual harassment and assault on university campuses were being artificially inflated to stoke anti-male sentiment. University women's groups and anti-violence representatives said Arndt's events were \"a misinformed and harmful attempt to undo the work of generations of student activists and advocates in combating the issues of sexual violence on campus\" and that she was \"mocking sexual assault survivors at [universities] around the country\".<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\":3\"/><ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nStudents protested her on-campus appearances<ref name=\"heterosexual\" /> and the student [[Sydney University Liberal Club|Liberal Club]] hosted her \"Fake Rape Crisis Campus Tour\" event at [[Sydney University]]. Afterwards Arndt lobbied and petitioned against her protesters in an attempt to have them disciplined. At the time ''[[The Saturday Paper]]'' reported that \"Federal government ministers and conservative media personalities have been quick to praise Arndt as the latest free speech hero threatened by a censorious left-wing culture on university campuses.\"<ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nArndt's \"Fake Rape Crisis\" university speaking tour was cited in the granting of her 2020 Order of Australia award.<ref name=\":3\" /> When referring to the former federal [[Minister for Women (Australia)|Minister for Women]], [[Kate Ellis]]', advocacy for victims on campus, Arndt stated that \"My campus work poses a direct threat to Ellis' longtime advocacy for victims of sexual assault.\"<ref name=\"storm\"/>\n\n===2020 Order of Australia award===\nArndt was appointed a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] (AM) in the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] \"for significant service to the community as a social commentator, and to gender equity through advocacy for men\".<ref name=\":3\" /> Among other significant services to the community,<ref name=\"gg\" /> the citation for Arndt's honour from the [[Council for the Order of Australia]] highlights her \"Campus Tour, since 2018\" (known as the \"Fake Rape Crisis\" Campus Tour),<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\"gg\" /> and for being a contributor to \"[[Jordan Peterson]]'s ''Thinkspot'', since 2019\" (an anti-censorship website).<ref name=\"thinkspot\" /><ref name=\"gg\" />\n\nArndt's appointment sparked a petition on [[Change.org]] calling for the honour to be revoked and had reached 33,000 signatures within the first week.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\":1\" /> The award also drew a reaction from prominent Australian women and abuse survivors,<ref name=\"ballarat\"/><ref name=\"survivor\"/> with 2015 [[Australian of the Year]] and domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty saying she felt \"sickened\" and \"utterly dismayed\" by it.<ref name=\":0\" /> Writer and activist [[Van Badham]] called the granting of the award \"vile\".<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":2\"/> Bester's sexual assault victim, Grace Tame, said that \"I believe that honouring someone who actively defended a paedophile on a public platform is a blatant example of the protracted, systemic moral corruption that still hampers our society.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Sharna Bremner, from End Rape on Campus Australia, said she also felt sick after hearing of the award to Arndt and to \"see someone like her be rewarded for mocking those people that have been sexually assaulted sends a message that sexual assault doesn't matter in this country, survivors don't matter, it's a huge slap in the face.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Arndt responded by saying the criticism shows \"the poisonous side of modern feminism and their determination to shut down anyone who challenges the orthodoxy\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/>\n \n[[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] attorney-general [[Jill Hennessy (politician)|Jill Hennessy]] wrote to the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[David Hurley]], urging that Arndt be stripped of the award,<ref name=\"stripped\"/> saying that \"Ms Arndt's views and activities diminish the devastating experiences of victim-survivors of family and sexual violence, promote division and encourage victim-survivors from taking steps to ensure their survival and safety.\"<ref name=\"jill\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) also called for Arndt's award to be withdrawn. Karen Williams, a psychiatrist from the group, said that \"Being awarded this honour gives her credibility that she doesn't deserve on this subject - she's had some psychological training but never been registered as a health practitioner; she doesn't work or do research in this field.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/> Also calling for the award to be revoked, Sue Williamson from the [[ADFA|University of New South Wales in Canberra]] noted that the relevant government \"Ordinance enables the Governor-General to revoke an award if the awardee has 'has behaved or acted in a manner that has brought disrepute on the order'\".<ref name=\"disturbing\"/>\n\nIn February 2020, following further controversy surrounding Arndt's comments on a [[Murder of Hannah Clarke|domestic violence quadruple murder-suicide]] in Queensland, Liberal MP Tim Smith wrote to the chairman of the Council of the Order of Australia, [[Shane Stone]], calling for her award to be revoked, the first [[bipartisan]] support for the move. He stated that Arndt's comments brought the Order into disrepute, were inconsistent with the role of the awards in acknowledging the bravery of military personnel, and suggested that \"the Council of the Order of Australia has an important role protecting the Vice-Regal office and the [[Monarchy of Australia|Crown in Australia]] from associating itself with views that seek to make excuses for extreme violence\".<ref name=\"calls grow\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/> Arndt had said, \"Congratulations to the Queensland police for keeping an open mind and awaiting proper evidence, including the possibility that Rowan Baxter might have been 'driven too far'. But note the misplaced outrage. How dare police deviate from the feminist script of seeking excuses...\"<ref name=\"calls grow\"/> Within days many politicians from Liberal, [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] and the [[Australian Greens|Greens]] were also calling for her award to be revoked,<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"mikakos\"/><ref name=\"federal\"/><ref name=\"geelong\"/><ref name=\"letter\"/><ref name=\"lyons\"/> including the Federal Minister for Women, [[Marise Payne]].<ref name=\"table\"/>\n\nOn 25 February 2020, the [[Australian Senate]] voted overwhelmingly in support of a motion calling for the revocation of Arndt's Order of Australia award, with [[Pauline Hanson]] and [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]] being the only senators to vote against the motion. The motion is not binding on the Order of Australia Council.<ref name=\"federal\"/> In response to the Senate vote Arndt said conservative MPs had \"caved in\" to \"feminist power\" and urged her supporters to \"maintain the rage\" and mobilise against what she believes are \"feral mobs trying to take [her] out\" in calling for her AM to be revoked.<ref name=\"urges\"/> Following the bipartisan Senate motion, the Governor-General's secretary Paul Singer told a Senate estimates committee that the Governor-General would not unilaterally revoke the award, \"because in practice the Governor-General does always act on the advice and recommendations of [the Council for the Order of Australia]\". While refusing to comment on Arndt's case specifically, he also noted in relation to past removals that they \"largely attribute to legal proceedings having been exhausted\" and confirmed that some recipients convicted of serious charges retained their awards while still undergoing appeals. ''The Age'' reported that these comments suggested that Arndt \"was unlikely to have her honour rescinded\", given that the reasons argued for revoking Arndt's award were not criminal in nature.<ref name=\"will not\"/>\n\n===Controversy about credentials===\nIn 2020, an article published by the ''[[New Matilda]]'' website pointed out that the media and publishers have frequently misrepresented Arndt as a [[psychologist]], [[clinical psychologist]] or doctor. The back cover of the 2009 edition of her book ''The Sex Diaries'' states that \"Bettina Arndt is a clinical psychologist\" and \"she draws on her thirty-five years of experience as a sex therapist and psychologist\". Arndt, however, is not a registered psychologist, clinical psychologist, [[medical doctor]] or has a [[PhD]] degree. The article criticised Arndt for distributing material containing these misrepresentations without correcting them. In response, Arndt stated that she never described herself in this way, saying that \"I've had a 45-year career. I say I trained as a clinical psychologist, I explain my career, whenever I'm asked to do a [[Curriculum vitae|CV]] or put it out publicly. But people still introduce me in the wrong way.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/> When she began her career, she did not need to register as a psychologist as the registration of psychologists only began with the ''Psychologists Act 1989'' (NSW).<ref name=\"rejects\"/><ref name=\"act\"/> The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) investigated the allegations detailed in the ''New Matilda'' article<ref name=\"watchdog\"/> and cautioned Arndt over the use of the 'psychologist' title, urging that she act to prevent media outlets from using incorrect titles when referring to her and to refrain from promoting any content in which she is falsely described.<ref name=\"escapes\"/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Arndt |first=Bettina |title=Female Forum: The Key to Being

Starting as a sex therapist and feminist, she came to public prominence in the 1970s, establishing a career in publishing and broadcasting as well as writing several books. In the last two decades she has abandoned feminism and attracted controversy with her social commentary and her views on sexual abuse, domestic violence and men's rights advocacy.\n\n== Early life ==\nArndt was born in [[Penrith, England]], to the economist [[Heinz Wolfgang Arndt|Heinz Arndt]] (1915 \u2013 6 May 2002) and Ruth (''n\u00e9e'' Strohsahl) (20 March 1915 \u2013 20 March 2001), the youngest of three children.<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/> Her parents were German, and escaped Nazi Germany prior to WWII.<ref name=\"father\"/> They emigrated to Australia in 1945 and she grew up in [[Canberra]].<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1971, after completing a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at the [[Australian National University]], Arndt moved to [[Sydney]] and studied at the [[University of New South Wales]] where she completed a [[Master of Psychology]] degree in 1973;<ref name=\"rats\" /><ref name=\"quals\"/> her thesis was on orgasm dysfunction.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"Overington\"/>\n\n== Family ==\nSince graduating, Arndt has predominantly lived in [[Woollahra]] in the eastern-suburbs of Sydney [[New South Wales]]. She was first married to journalist Dennis Minogue in 1977, who died in 1981. Arndt and Minoque were business partners during this time. Her second marriage was to American corporate lawyer Warren Scott in 1986, and they divorced in 2007. During the years 1986 to 1991 she lived with Scott in the borough of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]] NY. Arndt has three children of her own, two girls and one boy.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"sexpert\"/><ref name=\"marries\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduation, Arndt practiced as a [[sex therapist]] until 1981.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She describes herself as \"one of Australia's first sex therapists\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/>\n\nArndt came to prominence in the 1970s by editing ''Forum'', an Australian adult sex education magazine, which led to frequent radio and television appearances. She was appointed editor in 1974 and remained in the position until July 1982.<ref name=\"advocate\"/> The publication proved controversial in conservative circles, and in [[Queensland Parliament]] in 1977 MP [[Des Frawley]] said: \"It is a dirty, filthy magazine\".<ref name=\"hansard\"/> [[Queensland Police Service|Queensland police]] also raided a newsagent, seizing copies of the magazine, requesting the proprietor [[show cause]].<ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\nBetween 1973 and 1976 the [[Australian Broadcasting Control Board]] had ruled, without explanation, that all TV and radio programs in which Arndt takes part in be pre-recorded so that they may be approved by station management before being transmitted.<ref name=\"abt\" /><ref name=\"tharunka\" />\n\nIn 1978 Arndt said that \"The sexual revolution has been a [[damp squib]]\" expressing some doubts about what level people were really more sophisticated in their attitudes toward sex. She did acknowledge that the The [[Women's Movement]] had made physiological discoveries about the sexuality of women, that there was more tolerance to one's [[sexual preference]], and there had been a recognition of the importance of sex for [[senior citizens]] and those with [[disabilities]]. Arndt also praised the introduction of [[South Australian]] laws criminalising [[rape]] within marriage.<ref name=\"noisy\"/>\n\nHer work in sex education also involved postgraduate courses, seminars and lectures for groups including doctors and other professionals. Following the death of her husband and business partner, Dennis Minogue, in 1981, ''Forum'' magazine closed.<ref name=\"advocate\" /> In the mid 1980s, Arndt wrote for ''[[Australian Playboy]]''<ref name=\"tharunka\"/> and also wrote about broader social issues for newspapers including ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. During this period Arndt also had her own radio program on [[2GB]] and regular radio segments in major cities all over Australia. In 1982 she appeared on the TV panel-show series ''[[Beauty and the Beast (talk show)|Beauty and the Beast]]''<ref name=\"beauty\" /> and, from 1981 to 1986, was a weekly guest on television program ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|The Today Show]]''.<ref name=\"cv2011\" />\n\nIn 1984, Arndt ran a mail-order lingerie and sex toy business and authored a number of books on sex advice, including ''The Bettina Arndt Guide to Lovemaking for Women'', in which she wrote that \"Looking at what's happening to men and women in bed today, it wouldn't surprise me at all if more and more males chose to stick to their beer. Sex is fast becoming a battlefield, with women calling more of the shots.\"<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nIn 1986 Arndt moved to New York City for five years and, while living in the United States, wrote a weekly newspaper column syndicated through ''The Age'' in [[Melbourne]] (and published in Canberra, [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]] and [[Brisbane]]). She had two books published featuring collections of her writings, ''Private Lives'' (1985) and ''All About Us'' (1989).<ref name=\"sexpert\"/> In 1991, Arndt returned with her family to live in Australia.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nFrom the 1990s onward Arndt wrote a personal advice column for ''[[Cleo (magazine)|Cleo magazine]]'',<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> wrote for ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'',<ref name=\"Talking\"/> ''[[The Australian]]'' and ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]''. She was a guest reporter on ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' on [[ABC TV (Australia)|ABC TV]]<ref name=\"gg\"/> and a regular guest on [[ABC Local Radio|ABC radio]] in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She was on the board of the [[Australian National University]] and was the president of the board of the [[Royal Women's Hospital]] Foundation in 1999. She also served as an online dating coach from 2001 to 2017,<ref name=\"gg\"/> and more recently has assisted men in writing their dating profiles and referring them on to good photographers for their dating profile photos.<ref name=\"could be\"/>\n\nDuring the first half of her career Arndt was a [[feminist]], but since the mid 1990s<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> has turned to men's rights advocacy.<ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> Her later work encapsulated socially conservative ideas about relationships and family structures.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"advocate\"/> In 2010, Arndt said, \"I spent my early career lobbying for women but turned to men when I realised how lousy they are about advocating for issues that affect their private lives.\"<ref name=\"Overington\"/> Kate Gleeson, a senior lecturer at [[Macquarie Law School]] who has studied her, says \"Arndt's extolling of men's rights, as well as her critique of feminist analyses of domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual harassment and sex within marriage, has provoked feminist ire in the press\", adding \"To Arndt's frustration, the male revolution she advocated of political reaction against feminism had failed to emerge\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nDuring the conservative [[Howard Government]] (1996-2007) Arndt was brought into the fold as an adviser on issues such as assisted reproduction, education and child support.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> She served on a number of committees advising the Australian Government on policy matters, including the National Advisory Committee on Ageing (2003), the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Review Team (2005) and the Child Support Review Reference Group (2004).<ref name=\"gg\"/> In 2003 the government awarded her the [[Centenary Medal]], which recognises \"people who made a contribution to Australian society or government.\"<ref name=\"cv2011\"/><ref name=\"centenary-medal/>. Gleeson observed that at this time Arndt had a \"persistent criticism of matters of [[family law]]\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> A government committee she was part of from 2000 to 2001, the Family Law Pathways Advisory Group, was instrumental in later redrafting Australian family law.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/>\n\nIn 2007, the Australian television program ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' demonstrated that a newspaper article written by Arndt for the ''[[Brisbane Courier Mail]]'' plagiarised large tracts of a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article by [[Dick Taverne]] published three years earlier.<ref name=\"leftovers\"/> The program also accused Arndt of journalistic non-disclosure in a column she wrote for ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' when she identified [[Kerryn Phelps]]'s same-sex marriage to [[Ascham School|Ascham Girls' School]] teacher Jackie Stricker. Arndt failed to disclose that her daughter attended the school and Phelps holds Arndt partly responsible for ending her wife's career there. In her defence Arndt said that \"I've never been anti-gay\", saying she was merely reporting the anxieties of some Ascham parents.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nArndt wrote ''The Sex Diaries'', based on the diaries of 98 couples talking about how they negotiate sex and deal with mismatched desire. It was published in 2009, followed by ''What Men Want'', another diary project published in September 2010.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"blokes\"/>\n\nIn 2010, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald#Good Weekend|Good Weekend]]'' said she had repositioned herself as \"a champion of the downtrodden male of the species\", adding that \"In her writing, the former libertine started to sound like a self-appointed guardian of public morals.\" Her friend Merri Southwood said of Arndt's newspaper columns at the time, \"I'm not sure how much of it is the author seeking an audience and how much is the genuine Bettina ... Because, in fact, the way she writes is sometimes a little at odds with her own personal life.\"<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nIn 2020 Arndt's previously good relationship with political conservatives and the conservative media shifted. ''Media Watch'' reported that \"Arndt has been in the media for more than 40 years and has written for many of Australia's leading papers and magazines as sex therapist, [[social commentator]] and, most recently, outspoken men's rights advocate\". But her comments on the [[murder of Hannah Clarke]] incident in 2020 had since led to near universal condemnation in the media, including those she had previously worked with. ''Media Watch'' questioned whether or not they would use her again in the future.<ref name=\"condemned\"/> When questioned about Arndt's time advising the Howard Government (1996-2007), Victorian [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] shadow minister [[Tim Smith (Australian politician)|Tim Smith]] said: \"I think Bettina Arndt has become more extreme as the years have gone by. I don't think she was nearly this extreme during the Howard Government years. I think some of her commentary of recent years has gone beyond mainstream Australia to the fringes.\"<ref name=\"crossed\"/> [[News Corp Australia|News Corp's]] [[David Penberthy]] lamented the loss of the Arndt of the 70s and 80s when she was a sex therapist and a \"fun person... trying to make couples happier through sex\", saying she seems to have now \"herded all of the really angry guys in Australia into the one corner and has, sort of, created almost a business model out of it\".<ref name=\"storm\"/>\n\n===Men's rights activism===\nArndt has now been termed a [[men's rights activist]],<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> and says \"we need to start calling out feminism which is a really destructive force in our society\".<ref name=\"condemned\"/> She believes there is a pervasive \"anti-male bias\" in society, media and the law - also extending into in areas such as divorce, cancer research and domestic violence - saying that women are prioritised, thus denying men their rights.<ref name=\"toxic\"/> In 2012, [[Janet_Albrechtsen|Albrechtsen]] wrote that Arndt \"now argues that with women dominating public discussion of gender and sexual issues, men's views are being silenced\".<ref name=\"Albrechtsen\"/> Arndt argues that \"[[radical feminism]], where men are presented as violent and sexist, is guilty of manshaming and destroying what should be a bond of mutual acceptance and respect between the sexes\".<ref name=\"toxic\"/> Arndt has been accused of being hostile towards women.<ref name=\"storm\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/> Author [[Susan Maushart]] says that Arndt \"seems, for whatever reason, to not like women very much\".<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\n===On partnerships and parenting===\nWhen Australia's first female prime minister, [[Julia Gillard]] (Labor), was elected in 2010, Arndt criticised the new prime minister for setting a bad example by living in a [[Common-law marriage|de facto]] relationship, or as Arndt described it \"marriage lite\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nArndt has been criticised for dismissing genuine academic research when writing about the children of [[LGBTIQ]] parents. Ex Federal Senator [[Brian Greig]] denounced Arndt for using \"the work of 'researchers' with strong links to the American religious right\" when discussing [[same-sex parenting]], saying she should have been \"able to distinguish such research from sham, politically motivated studies.\"<ref name=\"qnews\"/>\n\n===Comments about sexual abuse===\nArndt has drawn controversy over several incidents in which she has been accused of downplaying the [[sexual abuse]] of children by adults.\n\nShe has suggested that rape is not always violent and has said that most children do not incur long-term damage from sexual assault.<ref name=\"silence\"/>\n\nIn 1997, Arndt defended a doctor who had molested a 12-year-old child and other patients including herself,<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> arguing that he should not be charged because in another context masturbation would have been \"a loving and pleasurable act\".<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn 2005, in an article in ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', Arndt discussed convicted [[paedophile]] Robert Potter, a scoutmaster who had molested four boys, one of whom subsequently attempted suicide. She described Potter as \"a good bloke\"<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> and argued that \"such minor abuse rarely has lasting consequences\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn a 2012 article she wrote that \"Demonising sexuality inevitably distorts a proper perspective on sexual crimes, leading to politically inspired calls for absurdly longer sentences, misinformation about the likelihood of offenders to reoffend and exaggeration of the emotional damage to the victims of minor abuse\" and that \"Our prurient interest in sex crimes often robs the perpetrator of any chance of redemption - as the sad death of cricket commentator [[Peter Roebuck]] bears witness.\"<ref name=\"prudes\"/>\n \nIn 2017, Arndt conducted a 17-minute interview for her YouTube channel with Nicolaas Bester, a high school teacher in [[Tasmania]] who in 2011 was sentenced to two years and 10 months jail for sexual assault,<ref name=\"urges\" /> maintaining a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old student<ref name=\"jailed\"/> and possessing child pornography.<ref name=\"ironic\"/> He was subsequently jailed again for producing child exploitation material<ref name=\"awesome\"/><ref name=\"silent\"/> and bragging that the sexual abuse had been \"awesome\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/> In the video, Arndt referred to \"sexually provocative behaviour from female students\" and said young women should \"behave sensibly and not exploit their seductive power to ruin the lives of men\". Bester's victim subsequently criticised Arndt for supporting Bester and accusing her of trivialising his crime,<ref name=\"arndt awarded\"/> saying there \"was no evidence of my provocative behaviour\". \"Not only is the interview disturbing because it gives a platform to a paedophile. It's not a truthful interview.\"<ref name=\"survivor\"/> Arndt was criticised for not seeking out the victim for her side of the story.<ref name=\"4bc\"/><ref name=\"ironic\" /> Following widespread public outrage, Arndt apologised for her tone and said her interview was in poor taste, but in a later interview said of Bester that \"He is not a [[pederast]]. He is not preying on kids.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/>\n\n===Domestic violence===\nArndt is a champion of male victims of [[domestic violence]] who have been abused by women and has said that the \"real picture\" of domestic violence is \"where our official evidence shows at least a third of the victims are male\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/><ref name=\"bring\"/> Arndt is an advocate for the purported statistical claim that \"one in three\" male victims of domestic violence have been abused by women.<ref name=\"no evidence\"/><ref name=\"fiction\"/> Jacinta Masters, from Gender Equity Victoria, says the statistics Arndt uses have \"been roundly dismissed by experts as inaccurate and a misrepresentation\".<ref name=\"no evidence\"/> Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety (ANROWS) says Arndt's \"claims: 1) are inaccurate; and 2) appear to be more focussed on undermining the gains made to address violence against women, than genuine concern for men subjected to violence.\"<ref name=\"anrows\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) states that Arndt \"has, for many years, been downplaying domestic violence - even in her language, she uses terms like the 'myth of domestic violence' and 'feminist narrative', so while we're trying to highlight it as a problem, she's casting doubt and doing the opposite of that.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/>\n\nArndt is a critic of domestic violence campaigner [[Rosie Batty]], saying that her campaigning \"denies women's role in family violence\" and that Batty has been \"playing the feminist puppet\".<ref name=\"mumbrella\"/>\n\t\nArndt defended a comment by a Queensland police officer that a man who had killed his wife and children by [[Death by burning|immolation]] may have been a \"husband being driven too far by issues\".<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"examines\"/><ref name=\"reece\"/>\n\n===2018 \"fake rape crisis\" campus tour===\nArndt says that there is a \"manufactured rape crisis\" on Australian university campuses fuelled by the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]], where the institutions convene a \"[[kangaroo court]]\" once an allegation has been made where the male alleged to have raped the female has no chance of defence.<ref name=\"bias\"/> In 2018-2019 she conducted her \"fake rape crisis\" university campus tour where she campaigned against changes to consent laws with her main argument being that rates of sexual harassment and assault on university campuses were being artificially inflated to stoke anti-male sentiment. University women's groups and anti-violence representatives said Arndt's events were \"a misinformed and harmful attempt to undo the work of generations of student activists and advocates in combating the issues of sexual violence on campus\" and that she was \"mocking sexual assault survivors at [universities] around the country\".<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\":3\"/><ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nStudents protested her on-campus appearances<ref name=\"heterosexual\" /> and the student [[Sydney University Liberal Club|Liberal Club]] hosted her \"Fake Rape Crisis Campus Tour\" event at [[Sydney University]]. Afterwards Arndt lobbied and petitioned against her protesters in an attempt to have them disciplined. At the time ''[[The Saturday Paper]]'' reported that \"Federal government ministers and conservative media personalities have been quick to praise Arndt as the latest free speech hero threatened by a censorious left-wing culture on university campuses.\"<ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nArndt's \"Fake Rape Crisis\" university speaking tour was cited in the granting of her 2020 Order of Australia award.<ref name=\":3\" /> When referring to the former federal [[Minister for Women (Australia)|Minister for Women]], [[Kate Ellis]]', advocacy for victims on campus, Arndt stated that \"My campus work poses a direct threat to Ellis' longtime advocacy for victims of sexual assault.\"<ref name=\"storm\"/>\n\n===2020 Order of Australia award===\nArndt was appointed a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] (AM) in the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] \"for significant service to the community as a social commentator, and to gender equity through advocacy for men\".<ref name=\":3\" /> Among other significant services to the community,<ref name=\"gg\" /> the citation for Arndt's honour from the [[Council for the Order of Australia]] highlights her \"Campus Tour, since 2018\" (known as the \"Fake Rape Crisis\" Campus Tour),<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\"gg\" /> and for being a contributor to \"[[Jordan Peterson]]'s ''Thinkspot'', since 2019\" (an anti-censorship website).<ref name=\"thinkspot\" /><ref name=\"gg\" />\n\nArndt's appointment sparked a petition on [[Change.org]] calling for the honour to be revoked and had reached 33,000 signatures within the first week.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\":1\" /> The award also drew a reaction from prominent Australian women and abuse survivors,<ref name=\"ballarat\"/><ref name=\"survivor\"/> with 2015 [[Australian of the Year]] and domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty saying she felt \"sickened\" and \"utterly dismayed\" by it.<ref name=\":0\" /> Writer and activist [[Van Badham]] called the granting of the award \"vile\".<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":2\"/> Bester's sexual assault victim, Grace Tame, said that \"I believe that honouring someone who actively defended a paedophile on a public platform is a blatant example of the protracted, systemic moral corruption that still hampers our society.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Sharna Bremner, from End Rape on Campus Australia, said she also felt sick after hearing of the award to Arndt and to \"see someone like her be rewarded for mocking those people that have been sexually assaulted sends a message that sexual assault doesn't matter in this country, survivors don't matter, it's a huge slap in the face.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Arndt responded by saying the criticism shows \"the poisonous side of modern feminism and their determination to shut down anyone who challenges the orthodoxy\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/>\n \n[[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] attorney-general [[Jill Hennessy (politician)|Jill Hennessy]] wrote to the [[Governor-General_of_Australia|Governor-General]], [[David Hurley]], urging that Arndt be stripped of the award,<ref name=\"stripped\"/> saying that \"Ms Arndt's views and activities diminish the devastating experiences of victim-survivors of family and sexual violence, promote division and encourage victim-survivors from taking steps to ensure their survival and safety.\"<ref name=\"jill\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) also called for Arndt's award to be withdrawn. Karen Williams, a psychiatrist from the group, said that \"Being awarded this honour gives her credibility that she doesn't deserve on this subject - she's had some psychological training but never been registered as a health practitioner; she doesn't work or do research in this field.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/> Also calling for the award to be revoked, Sue Williamson from the [[ADFA|University of New South Wales in Canberra]] noted that the relevant government \"Ordinance enables the Governor-General to revoke an award if the awardee has 'has behaved or acted in a manner that has brought disrepute on the order'\".<ref name=\"disturbing\"/>\n\nIn February 2020, following further controversy surrounding Arndt's comments on a [[Murder of Hannah Clarke|domestic violence quadruple murder-suicide]] in Queensland, Liberal MP Tim Smith wrote to the chairman of the Council of the Order of Australia, [[Shane Stone]], calling for her award to be revoked, the first [[bipartisan]] support for the move. He stated that Arndt's comments brought the Order into disrepute, were inconsistent with the role of the awards in acknowledging the bravery of military personnel, and suggested that \"the Council of the Order of Australia has an important role protecting the Vice-Regal office and the [[Monarchy_of_Australia|Crown in Australia]] from associating itself with views that seek to make excuses for extreme violence\".<ref name=\"calls grow\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/> Arndt had said, \"Congratulations to the Queensland police for keeping an open mind and awaiting proper evidence, including the possibility that Rowan Baxter might have been 'driven too far'. But note the misplaced outrage. How dare police deviate from the feminist script of seeking excuses...\"<ref name=\"calls grow\"/> Within days many politicians from Liberal, [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] and the [[Australian Greens|Greens]] were also calling for her award to be revoked,<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"mikakos\"/><ref name=\"federal\"/><ref name=\"geelong\"/><ref name=\"letter\"/><ref name=\"lyons\"/> including the Federal Minister for Women, [[Marise Payne]].<ref name=\"table\"/>\n\nOn 25 February 2020, the [[Australian Senate]] voted overwhelmingly in support of a motion calling for the revocation of Arndt's Order of Australia award, with [[Pauline Hanson]] and [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]] being the only senators to vote against the motion. The motion is not binding on the Order of Australia Council.<ref name=\"federal\"/> In response to the Senate vote Arndt said conservative MPs had \"caved in\" to \"feminist power\" and urged her supporters to \"maintain the rage\" and mobilise against what she believes are \"feral mobs trying to take [her] out\" in calling for her AM to be revoked.<ref name=\"urges\"/> Following the bipartisan Senate motion, the Governor-General's secretary Paul Singer told a Senate estimates committee that the Governor-General would not unilaterally revoke the award, \"because in practice the Governor-General does always act on the advice and recommendations of [the Council for the Order of Australia]\". While refusing to comment on Arndt's case specifically, he also noted in relation to past removals that they \"largely attribute to legal proceedings having been exhausted\" and confirmed that some recipients convicted of serious charges retained their awards while still undergoing appeals. ''The Age'' reported that these comments suggested that Arndt \"was unlikely to have her honour rescinded\", given that the reasons argued for revoking Arndt's award were not criminal in nature.<ref name=\"will not\"/>\n\n===Controversy about credentials===\nIn 2020, an article published by the ''[[New Matilda]]'' website pointed out that the media and publishers have frequently misrepresented Arndt as a [[psychologist]], [[clinical psychologist]] or doctor. The back cover of the 2009 edition of her book ''The Sex Diaries'' states that \"Bettina Arndt is a clinical psychologist\" and \"she draws on her thirty-five years of experience as a sex therapist and psychologist\". Arndt, however, is not a registered psychologist, clinical psychologist, [[medical doctor]] or has a [[PhD]] degree. The article criticised Arndt for distributing material containing these misrepresentations without correcting them. In response, Arndt stated that she never described herself in this way, saying that \"I've had a 45-year career. I say I trained as a clinical psychologist, I explain my career, whenever I'm asked to do a [[Curriculum_vitae|CV]] or put it out publicly. But people still introduce me in the wrong way.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/> When she began her career, she did not need to register as a psychologist as the registration of psychologists only began with the ''Psychologists Act 1989'' (NSW).<ref name=\"rejects\"/><ref name=\"act\"/> The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) investigated the allegations detailed in the ''New Matilda'' article<ref name=\"watchdog\"/> and cautioned Arndt over the use of the 'psychologist' title, urging that she act to prevent media outlets from using incorrect titles when referring to her and to refrain from promoting any content in which she is falsely described.<ref name=\"escapes\"/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Arndt |first=Bettina |title=Female Forum: The Key to Being

His record was not broken until [[Brian Lara]] scored 375 in 1994. Sobers was made [[Captain (cricket)|captain]] of the West Indies in 1965, a role which he would hold until 1972. He would also captain a [[Rest of the World cricket team in England in 1970|Rest of the World XI]] during their 1970 tour of England.\n\nOverall, Sobers played 93 Tests for the West Indies, scoring 8032 runs at an [[Batting average (cricket)|average]] of 57.78, and taking 235 [[wicket]]s at an [[Bowling average|average]] of 34.03.

Seven clubs approached Sobers and, on 14 December 1967, [[Nottinghamshire CCC|Nottinghamshire]] announced that he had signed for them and had been appointed club captain. Sobers stated that, although he had enjoyed his time in league cricket, he had a definite preference for the first-class game and he looked forward to restoring Nottinghamshire's fortunes. Though details were undisclosed, ''Wisden 1968'' speculated that his contract would run for three years and be worth \u00a37000 a year (a very high income at the time), including an apartment and a car.<ref name=\"W68\"/>\n\n===Six sixes in an over===\nOn 31 August 1968, Sobers became the first [[batsman]] ever to hit six [[boundary (cricket)#Scoring runs|sixes]] in a single [[over (cricket)|over]] of six consecutive balls in [[first-class cricket]].

His versatility enabled him to bowl all varieties of left-arm bowling from [[left-arm spin|spin]] to [[fast bowling|fast-medium]]. As a [[Fielding (cricket)|fielder]] he was usually stationed close to the wicket but he was also a very capable outfielder.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[Richie Benaud]] described Sobers as \"the greatest all-round cricketer the world has seen\".<ref name=\"RB\">Benaud, p. 119.</ref> Sobers, wrote Benaud, was \"a brilliant batsman, splendid [[Fielding (cricket)|fielder]], particularly close to the wicket, and a bowler of extraordinary skill, whether bowling with the new ball, providing orthodox left-arm spin or over-the-wrist spin\".<ref name=\"RB\"/>\n\n[[Fred Trueman]] enjoyed a great rivalry with Sobers and later described him as a \"sublime left-hand batsman\" who was \"one of the greatest cricketers ever to have graced the game, certainly the greatest all-rounder\". Trueman went on to say that Sobers as a batsman \"has a great cricketing brain and his thought processes are lightning quick\".<ref>Trueman, p. 294.</ref>\n\n[[C. L. R. James]], when describing the batsmanship of [[Wilton St Hill]], commented upon St Hill's ability to judge the ball early in its flight and so quickly decide which stroke to play.

Sobers could also operate as a seamer, sometimes using medium pace, but he was much more effective when he bowled fast. With the new ball, he could make the delivery curve late in flight at high speed; his action being a loose, springy run followed by a \"whiplash\" delivery.<ref>Frith, p. 195.</ref>\n\nThough he mostly fielded close to the wicket, Sobers was an exceptional outfielder who was seen on one occasion, when he had fielded the ball on the boundary, to \"bend his hand back almost parallel with his arm before flipping the ball a full seventy yards to the wicketkeeper\".<ref>Major, p. 214.</ref>\n\nFollowing his success as captain of West Indies on the [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1966|1966 tour of England]], the 1967 edition of ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' declared that for Sobers \"(the 1966 Tests) were one triumph after another with bat and ball, as well as in the field as a master tactician and fantastic catcher close to the bat\".<ref>''Wisden at Lord's'', p. 163.</ref> Sobers' exploits in 1966 earned him the media-bestowed sobriquet of \"King Cricket\", which soon afterwards became the title of a book about him.<ref>[[Alan Bestic]], ''King Cricket \u2013 Gary Sobers'', Pelham Books Ltd, 1967.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nSobers was briefly engaged to Indian actress [[Anju Mahendru]] after he met her on the 1966\u201367 tour of India.<ref>Sobers, pp. 168\u201369.</ref> He married Prue Kirby, an Australian, in September 1969.<ref>Sobers, p. 244.</ref> They had two sons, Matthew and Daniel, and an adopted daughter, Genevieve.<ref>Sobers, p. 241.</ref> The marriage ended in divorce in 1990 after the couple broke up in 1984;<ref>Sobers, p. 245.</ref> however, Sobers acquired dual Australian citizenship through marriage in 1980.<ref name=cit80/><ref name=citmarr/>\n\nHe says that his was a multi-sporting family who were all good at [[football (soccer)|football]], [[basketball]], [[table tennis]] and [[tennis]].<ref>Sobers, p. 11.</ref> His own favourite sport is [[golf]] and he has been an enthusiastic gambler.<ref>Sobers, ch. 20.</ref> He is the author of a children's novel about cricket, ''Bonaventure and the Flashing Blade'', in which computer analysis helps a university cricket team become unbeatable.<ref>Garfield Sobers, ''Bonaventure and the Flashing Blade'', Pelham Books, 1967.</ref>\n\n==Honours and legacy==\n[[File:Sobers statue kensington.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sobers outside Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados]]\nIn the [[1975 New Year Honours]], [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] created Sobers a [[Knight Bachelor]] for his services to cricket.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=46444 |supp=y|pages=1\u20132|date=31 December 1974}} Retrieved on 27 April 2008.</ref> The award was made in the British Diplomatic and Overseas section of the list, rather than on the nomination of the Government of Barbados, which had stopped putting forward recommendations for British honours.

The club plays in the [[J1 League]], which is the top tier of football in the country.  Its name comes from the former city of [[Urawa, Saitama|Urawa]], which is now a part of Saitama City.\n\nThe name Red Diamonds alludes to the club's pre-professional era parent company [[Mitsubishi]]. The corporation's logo consists of three red diamonds, one of which remains within the current club badge.\n\n==History==\nShin-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries established a football club in 1950<ref>[http://www.urawa-reds.co.jp/Club/mitu.htm \u6d66\u548c\u30ec\u30c3\u30ba\u5e74\u8868] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025012457/http://www.urawa-reds.co.jp/Club/mitu.htm |date=2008-10-25 }}, Urawa Red Diamonds</ref> in [[Kobe]] and moved the club to Tokyo in 1958. In [[1965 in Japanese football|1965]] it formed the [[Japan Soccer League]] along with today's [[Sanfrecce Hiroshima]], [[JEF United Ichihara Chiba]], [[Kashiwa Reysol]], [[Cerezo Osaka]] and three other clubs who have since been relegated to regional leagues.\n\nMitsubishi first won the JSL championship in 1969, as a break in Mazda/Sanfrecce's dominance (and also with the fact that Toyo were in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], competing in the [[1969 Asian Club Championship|Asian Club Cup]]); their runs up the first division were sporadic but steady until the 1980s when they fell into the Second Division. In 1990 they were promoted as JSL 2 champions, and thus were ready when the J-League implementation began in earnest.\n\nMitsubishi were the first Japanese club to complete a domestic [[The Treble|treble]], when in 1978 they won the title, the [[Emperor's Cup]] and the [[Japan Soccer League Cup]].\n\nThe club has enjoyed mixed fortunes since the J-League advent. The club finished bottom of the league for the first two seasons of the J-League with an average crowd of under 15,000. In 1999 they suffered relegation to the second tier of Japanese football yet again. The team has since improved in form in recent years, starting with a 2003 victory in the [[J.League Cup|Nabisco Cup]].\n\nIn [[2006 J.League Division 1|2006]] Urawa clinched their first professional league title by defeating runners-up [[Gamba Osaka]] 3\u20132 on December 2 before 63,000 supporters. This came after two close calls in the previous two years.  In [[2005 J.League Division 1|2005]], they finished 2nd, one point behind champions [[Gamba Osaka]]. In [[2004 J.League Division 1|2004]], they finished 3rd in the first stage and won the second stage. Having qualified for the two-match [[J.League Championship]] decider, they lost on penalty kicks to [[Yokohama F. Marinos]].\n\nUrawa were back to back [[Emperor's Cup]] winners in 2005 and 2006. Winning the title for the first time since establishment as a professional team, they defeated [[Shimizu S-Pulse]] 2\u20131 on January 1, 2006, and retained the title in 2007 with a 1\u20130 win over Gamba Osaka. This win also completed a [[Double (association football)|league-cup double]]. In the 2007 tournament they were defeated at the first hurdle by J2 outfit [[Ehime FC]].\n\nIn 2007, despite a seemingly unassailable lead of seven points with four games remaining, Urawa picked up only two points from their final four games. This run included losing at home to Kashima Antlers; the team who would leapfrog Urawa on the final day of the season to claim their fifth J.League title. Following their capitulation in the fourth round of the Emperor's Cup to J2 outfit [[Ehime FC]], Urawa had to be content with their [[2007 AFC Champions League|2007]] Asian Champions League title. Urawa recorded their first international title after overcoming [[Iran]]ian team [[Sepahan F.C.]] 3\u20131 on aggregate. The victory made them the first Japanese side to win the title since the competition was reorganised from the Asian Champions Cup in 2003. In the [[FIFA Club World Cup 2007|Club World Cup]] of the same year, Urawa became the first [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] team to finish in third place, beating Tunisian [[\u00c9toile Sportive du Sahel]] side on penalty kicks in the third / fourth place play off.\n\nIn 2008, Urawa attempted to win their second consecutive Asian Champions League title and progressed to the semi finals where they were defeated by fellow J-League rivals, and eventual Champions League winners, Gamba Osaka 3\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nOn March 8, 2014, a banner which read \"JAPANESE ONLY\" was hung at one of the entrances to the stands.<ref>{{cite web|last1=ARUDOU|first1=DEBITO|title=J.League and media must show red card to racism|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2014/03/12/issues/j-league-and-media-must-show-red-card-to-racism#.VuQK6OJ9600|website=Japan Times|accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref> As punishment for this racist behavior, the March 23 match was played in an [[Behind closed doors (sport)|empty stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Urawa Reds play to empty stadium after fans banned for racist banner|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/26704368|website=BBC|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==International affiliation==\nThe club is also notable in that former [[Feyenoord Rotterdam|Feyenoord]] midfielder [[Shinji Ono]] began his professional career playing for Urawa. Ono returned for the 2006 season for a second stint with the club.

The Japanese club, missing key players, lost their first game 5\u20132 against the Argentinian side [[Boca Juniors]].  The second fixture against the hosts, Manchester United, was called off due to a massive electric storm.  Some 800 Urawa fans had travelled to the game and were later compensated.\n\nThe club's supporters also have an unofficial relationship with [[Shanghai Shenhua]]. The clubs' supporters will support each other in continental competition. For example, Shenhua fans will support Urawa when Urawa plays in Shanghai against Shanghai SIPG.<ref>[https://wildeastfootball.net/2017/03/urawa-shenhua-alliance-shows-football-has-no-borders/]</ref>\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:Manchester united vs urawa red diamonds.jpg|thumb|right|International friendly match against Manchester United, July 30, 2005, [[Saitama Stadium]]]]\nSince the establishment of J.League in 1992, the team had used tracked [[Urawa Komaba Stadium]] as its home stadium. Due to the increasing popularity of the matches, Saitama City, owner of the stadium, expanded the seat capacity some times. The team used [[\u014cmiya Park Soccer Stadium]] until the works were complete. In spite of the poor performance of the team, the stadium was filled with faithful supporters, drawing an average audience of twenty thousand people.\n\nIn October 2001, [[Saitama Prefecture]] built new football-specific [[Saitama Stadium]] in Saitama city. This stadium was used as a venue for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. After the World Cup the club gradually increased home games in Saitama Stadium and in 2003 the stadium was formally designated as the home stadium. In 2008, only two games were held at Komaba Stadium.\n\n==Facilities==\nUrawa Reds uses Ohara City Field for training. In addition to this facility, the club opened Redsland in 2005, which has three grass fields, one [[artificial turf]] field, one [[baseball]] field, [[futsal]] courts and [[tennis courts]].<ref>[http://www.urawa-reds.co.jp/redsland/index.html \u30ec\u30c3\u30ba\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9 | \u6d66\u548c\u30ec\u30c3\u30ba] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024211422/http://www.urawa-reds.co.jp/redsland/index.html |date=2008-10-24 }}, Urawa Red Diamonds</ref> Redsland is opened to the public and club members can use the facilities at relatively cheap fees.\n\n==Rivalries==\nUrawa Red Diamonds has a [[local derby]] with [[Omiya Ardija]], from [[\u014cmiya-ku, Saitama]] city. They first met in the [[1987 Emperor's Cup]], with Mitsubishi defeating NTT Kanto by 5 to 0 at [[Nishigaoka National Stadium]]. The derby first took place in the JSL Second Division in the [[1989\u201390 Japan Soccer League|1989\u201390 season]], and it wouldn't take place until the [[2000 J.League Division 1|2000 season]] when Urawa was relegated to the second tier again. In 2003 the formerly separate Omiya and Urawa cities merged to become [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama city]], and since 2005 the derby became a top flight fixture after Omiya was promoted.\n\nDuring the JSL years and into the 1990s, Urawa's main top flight rivals were [[JEF United Ichihara Chiba]] and [[Kashiwa Reysol]], both now based in [[Chiba Prefecture]]. Because of their former parent companies' headquarters being all based in [[Marunouchi]], Tokyo, the three clubs were known as \u4e38\u306e\u5185\u5fa1\u4e09\u5bb6 ''Marunouchi Gosanke'' (\"Marunouchi Big Three\") and fixtures between them were known as ''Marunouchi derbies'', although the term is falling out of use as they are now based in different prefectures and rarely play home games in Tokyo stadiums.\n\nRivals further afield include [[Kashima Antlers]], [[FC Tokyo]], [[Yokohama Marinos]], [[Kawasaki Frontale]], and, even farther away, [[Gamba Osaka]]. Old JSL championship rivalries with [[Sanfrecce Hiroshima]], [[Cerezo Osaka]] and [[Shonan Bellmare]] have ebbed down as those clubs had nadirs in the second tier.\n\n==Women's and Amateur Teams==\nThe club also has [[Women's association football|women's]] and amateur teams.\n* Women's: [[Urawa Red Diamonds Ladies]]<ref>[http://www.urawa-reds.co.jp/ladies/index.html URAWA REDS LADIES] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024212240/http://www.urawa-reds.co.jp/ladies/index.html |date=2008-10-24 }}, Urawa Red Diamonds</ref>  in [[L.

[[association football|football]] club based in [[Saitama (city)|Saitama]], part of the [[Greater Tokyo Area]]. The club plays in the [[J1 League]], which is the top tier of football in the country.  Its name comes from the former city of [[Urawa, Saitama|Urawa]], which is now a part of Saitama City.\n\nThe name Red Diamonds alludes to the club's pre-professional era parent company [[Mitsubishi]]. The corporation's logo consists of three red diamonds, one of which remains within the current club badge.\n\n==History==\nShin-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries established a football club in 1950<ref>[http://www.urawa-reds.co.jp/Club/mitu.htm \u6d66\u548c\u30ec\u30c3\u30ba\u5e74\u8868] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025012457/http://www.urawa-reds.co.jp/Club/mitu.htm |date=2008-10-25 }}, Urawa Red Diamonds</ref> in [[Kobe]] and moved the club to Tokyo in 1958. In [[1965 in Japanese football|1965]] it formed the [[Japan Soccer League]] along with today's [[Sanfrecce Hiroshima]], [[JEF United Ichihara Chiba]], [[Kashiwa Reysol]], [[Cerezo Osaka]] and three other clubs who have since been relegated to regional leagues.\n\nMitsubishi first won the JSL championship in 1969, as a break in Mazda/Sanfrecce's dominance (and also with the fact that Toyo were in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], competing in the [[1969 Asian Club Championship|Asian Club Cup]]); their runs up the first division were sporadic but steady until the 1980s when they fell into the Second Division. In 1990 they were promoted as JSL 2 champions, and thus were ready when the J-League implementation began in earnest.\n\nMitsubishi were the first Japanese club to complete a domestic [[The Treble|treble]], when in 1978 they won the title, the [[Emperor's Cup]] and the [[Japan Soccer League Cup]].\n\nThe club has enjoyed mixed fortunes since the J-League advent. The club finished bottom of the league for the first two seasons of the J-League with an average crowd of under 15,000. In 1999 they suffered relegation to the second tier of Japanese football yet again. The team has since improved in form in recent years, starting with a 2003 victory in the [[J.League Cup|Nabisco Cup]].\n\nIn [[2006 J.League Division 1|2006]] Urawa clinched their first professional league title by defeating runners-up [[Gamba Osaka]] 3\u20132 on December 2 before 63,000 supporters. This came after two close calls in the previous two years.  In [[2005 J.League Division 1|2005]], they finished 2nd, one point behind champions [[Gamba Osaka]]. In [[2004 J.League Division 1|2004]], they finished 3rd in the first stage and won the second stage. Having qualified for the two-match [[J.League Championship]] decider, they lost on penalty kicks to [[Yokohama F. Marinos]].\n\nUrawa were back to back [[Emperor's Cup]] winners in 2005 and 2006. Winning the title for the first time since establishment as a professional team, they defeated [[Shimizu S-Pulse]] 2\u20131 on January 1, 2006, and retained the title in 2007 with a 1\u20130 win over Gamba Osaka. This win also completed a [[Double (association football)|league-cup double]]. In the 2007 tournament they were defeated at the first hurdle by J2 outfit [[Ehime FC]].\n\nIn 2007, despite a seemingly unassailable lead of seven points with four games remaining, Urawa picked up only two points from their final four games. This run included losing at home to Kashima Antlers; the team who would leapfrog Urawa on the final day of the season to claim their fifth J.League title. Following their capitulation in the fourth round of the Emperor's Cup to J2 outfit [[Ehime FC]], Urawa had to be content with their [[2007 AFC Champions League|2007]] Asian Champions League title. Urawa recorded their first international title after overcoming [[Iran]]ian team [[Sepahan F.C.]] 3\u20131 on aggregate. The victory made them the first Japanese side to win the title since the competition was reorganised from the Asian Champions Cup in 2003. In the [[FIFA Club World Cup 2007|Club World Cup]] of the same year, Urawa became the first [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] team to finish in third place, beating Tunisian [[\u00c9toile Sportive du Sahel]] side on penalty kicks in the third / fourth place play off.\n\nIn 2008, Urawa attempted to win their second consecutive Asian Champions League title and progressed to the semi finals where they were defeated by fellow J-League rivals, and eventual Champions League winners, Gamba Osaka 3\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nOn March 8, 2014, a banner which read \"JAPANESE ONLY\" was hung at one of the entrances to the stands.<ref>{{cite web|last1=ARUDOU|first1=DEBITO|title=J.League and media must show red card to racism|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2014/03/12/issues/j-league-and-media-must-show-red-card-to-racism#.VuQK6OJ9600|website=Japan Times|accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref> As punishment for this racist behavior, the March 23rd match was played in an [[Behind closed doors (sport)|empty stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Urawa Reds play to empty stadium after fans banned for racist banner|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/26704368|website=BBC|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==International affiliation==\nThe club is also notable in that former [[Feyenoord Rotterdam|Feyenoord]] midfielder [[Shinji Ono]] began his professional career playing for Urawa. Ono returned for the 2006 season for a second stint with the club.

The Japanese club, missing key players, lost their first game 5\u20132 against the Argentinian side [[Boca Juniors]].  The second fixture against the hosts, Manchester United, was called off due to a massive electric storm.  Some 800 Urawa fans had travelled to the game and were later compensated.\n\nThe club's supporters also have an unofficial relationship with [[Shanghai Shenhua]]. The clubs' supporters will support each other in continental competition. For example, Shenhua fans will support Urawa when Urawa plays in Shanghai against Shanghai SIPG.<ref>[https://wildeastfootball.net/2017/03/urawa-shenhua-alliance-shows-football-has-no-borders/]</ref>\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:Manchester united vs urawa red diamonds.jpg|thumb|right|International friendly match against Manchester United, July 30, 2005, [[Saitama Stadium]]]]\nSince the establishment of J.League in 1992, the team had used tracked [[Urawa Komaba Stadium]] as its home stadium. Due to the increasing popularity of the matches, Saitama City, owner of the stadium, expanded the seat capacity some times. The team used [[\u014cmiya Park Soccer Stadium]] until the works were complete. In spite of the poor performance of the team, the stadium was filled with faithful supporters, drawing an average audience of twenty thousand people.\n\nIn October 2001, [[Saitama Prefecture]] built new football-specific [[Saitama Stadium]] in Saitama city. This stadium was used as a venue for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. After the World Cup the club gradually increased home games in Saitama Stadium and in 2003 the stadium was formally designated as the home stadium. In 2008, only two games were held at Komaba Stadium.\n\n==Facilities==\nUrawa Reds uses Ohara City Field for training. In addition to this facility, the club opened Redsland in 2005, which has three grass fields, one [[artificial turf]] field, one [[baseball]] field, [[futsal]] courts and [[tennis courts]].<ref>[http://www.urawa-reds.co.jp/redsland/index.html \u30ec\u30c3\u30ba\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9 | \u6d66\u548c\u30ec\u30c3\u30ba] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024211422/http://www.urawa-reds.co.jp/redsland/index.html |date=2008-10-24 }}, Urawa Red Diamonds</ref> Redsland is opened to the public and club members can use the facilities at relatively cheap fees.\n\n==Rivalries==\nUrawa Red Diamonds has a [[local derby]] with [[Omiya Ardija]], from [[\u014cmiya-ku, Saitama]] city. They first met in the [[1987 Emperor's Cup]], with Mitsubishi defeating NTT Kanto by 5 to 0 at [[Nishigaoka National Stadium]]. The derby first took place in the JSL Second Division in the [[1989\u201390 Japan Soccer League|1989\u201390 season]], and it wouldn't take place until the [[2000 J.League Division 1|2000 season]] when Urawa was relegated to the second tier again. In 2003 the formerly separate Omiya and Urawa cities merged to become [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama city]], and since 2005 the derby became a top flight fixture after Omiya was promoted.\n\nDuring the JSL years and into the 1990s, Urawa's main top flight rivals were [[JEF United Ichihara Chiba]] and [[Kashiwa Reysol]], both now based in [[Chiba Prefecture]].

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on February 9, 1997.{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=226\u2013227}} In the episode, ''[[The Itchy & Scratchy Show]]'' attempts to regain lost viewers by introducing a new character named Poochie, voiced by [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]. The episode is largely self-referential and satirizes the world of television production, fans of ''The Simpsons'', and the series itself. It was written by [[David X. Cohen]] and directed by [[Steven Dean Moore]]. [[Alex Rocco]] is a credited guest voice as [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Roger Meyers Jr.|Roger Meyers, Jr.]] for the third and final time (having previously provided the character's voice in \"[[Itchy & Scratchy & Marge]]\" and \"[[The Day the Violence Died]]\"); [[Phil Hartman]] also guest stars as [[Troy McClure]].{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=226\u2013227}} Poochie would become a minor recurring character and [[Comic Book Guy]]'s catchphrase, \"Worst episode ever\", is introduced in this episode. With \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\", the show's 167th episode, ''The Simpsons'' surpassed ''[[The Flintstones]]'' in the number of episodes produced for a prime-time [[animated series]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Krusty the Clown]] threatens to ditch ''[[The Itchy & Scratchy Show]]'' because the cartoon causes his ratings to nosedive during that segment of his show. Cartoon producer [[Itchy & Scratchy Show#Roger Meyers, Jr.|Roger Meyers]] convenes a [[focus group]] to discover why ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'' has lost its appeal. In the focus group, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] explains that the show has lost its impact on audiences after being on the air for so long. \n\nMeyers decides that the cartoon needs a new character: Poochie, a dog with \"attitude\" who surfs, raps, and plays electric guitar. At [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and Lisa's suggestion, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] auditions for Poochie's voice and gets the part. To promote Poochie, he and voice actor June Bellamy make several publicity stops, where they encounter the show's hardcore fans. Homer invites his friends and relatives to watch the first ''Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show''. However, the cartoon is full of asinine antics, with none of the show's flair or trademark violence. Unimpressed by the manic Poochie character, Homer's friends say little as they leave.\n\nMeyers decides to kill off Poochie, but Homer resolves to save him. At the next recording session, Homer goes off-script and implores the audience to give Poochie a chance. The show's production team appears moved by Homer's plea, but when the episode airs, Meyers has dubbed over Homer's voice: the new dialogue says that Poochie has \"died on the way back to his home planet\". The studio audience cheers as Krusty displays an [[affidavit]] swearing Poochie will never return. Homer feels betrayed but attributes the whole affair to the fickle nature of show business.\n\n==Production==\n\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\" was written by [[David X. Cohen]] and directed by [[Steven Dean Moore]].{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=226\u2013227}} The episode was conceived as a commentary on what it was like to work on a television show that had long been on the air, but was considered to be nearing its end. This was intended to show that ''The Simpsons'' could still be good after eight seasons, even though it no longer had the \"shock value\" it did in the early years.<ref name=Cohencom>{{cite video |people=Cohen, David |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Before production of season eight began, several executives at Fox suggested the staff add a new character to the show, who would live with the Simpsons on a permanent basis, in a bid to freshen up the series.<ref name=Groeningcom>{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/silverman.asp |title=Family Matters \u2013 The David Silverman Interview |work=[[MSNBC]] |author=Tom Heintjes |accessdate=August 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217065814/http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/silverman.asp |archivedate=February 17, 2010}}</ref> The writers found the suggestion, usually considered a sign of desperation to boost a flagging series,<ref name=\"Alberti, p. 144\"/> amusing, therefore much of the episode revolves around this trope. Parallel to the episode's main plot, where Poochie is introduced on ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'' to boost its ratings, the writers inserted the one-time character Roy, a college-aged man who is shown to be living with the Simpsons, with no explanation as to his character or presence, as a reference to the executives' proposal.<ref name=Smithcom>{{cite video |people=Smith, Yeardley |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Roy was originally conceived for the \"Time and Punishment\" segment of the [[The Simpsons (season 6)|season six]] episode \"[[Treehouse of Horror V]]\", living with the Simpsons in one of the alternate realities,<ref name=Cohencom/> as a second, teenage son in the family.<ref name=\"Daniels\">{{cite video |people=Daniels, Greg |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Sixth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Treehouse of Horror V\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\nCohen's initial vision for Poochie was that he would be annoying to fans because he was wealthy, aloof and unlikeable. In the episode's DVD commentary he read his script for the first cartoon featuring Itchy, Scratchy, and Poochie:\n{{Cquote|Itchy and Scratchy are laborers in Poochie's gold mine. Poochie sits on a velvet throne surrounded by [[Money bag|bags of money]]. He drinks champagne as he whips Itchy and Scratchy and lectures them on the value of hard work in a capitalist society. Finally, Itchy and Scratchy get fed up and plan their revenge. They decide Scratchy will present a fake money bag to Poochie. Itchy will secretly be hiding in the bag. When Poochie raises the bag to inhale the sweet smell of money, Itchy will jab him in the nose with a syringe of poison. Itchy gets in the bag and Scratchy presents it to Poochie, but the plan backfires because Poochie is offended by how small the money bag is. To demonstrate how worthless it is to him, he sets it on fire and uses it to light his cigar. Itchy's flaming skeleton falls out of the burning bag, and the syringe lands on Scratchy's toe and kills him, too. Poochie says, \"Oh, well, I can always use my millions of dollars to hire more workers. That's the power of money.\" The end.<ref name=Cohencom/>}}\n\nAs with other episodes centering on the production of ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'', such as \"[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]\", the show's staff are shown. Almost all of them are based on the actual staff of ''The Simpsons''.<ref name=Cohencom/> In the first scene at the production table the person in the lower right corner, wearing a squid T-shirt, is Cohen. On the left side, the furthest away is [[Bill Oakley]] with [[Josh Weinstein]] next to him. Next to Weinstein is [[George Meyer]], who is the writer who speaks out and gets fired. The animator shown designing Poochie is supervising director [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]]. As Silverman plays the [[tuba]], one was drawn into the background of the scene. Other writers who appear include [[Dan McGrath]], [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]], [[Donick Cary]], [[Ron Hauge]], [[Ned Goldreyer]], and [[Mike Scully]], who had to be added in later, as the animators did not have a photo to use as a likeness.<ref name=Cohencom/>\n\nThis episode also features the first use of [[Comic Book Guy]]'s catchphrase \"Worst. Episode. Ever.\", which was taken from the [[alt.tv.simpsons]] newsgroup.<ref name=Cohencom/>\n\n==Themes==\nThis episode saw ''The Simpsons'' surpass ''[[The Flintstones]]'' for the number of episodes produced for an [[animated series]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,290859,00.html |title=1997 Timeline |accessdate=March 13, 2007 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Marlene |last=McCampbell |date=December 26, 1997}}</ref> The episode therefore deals with the issue of longevity and the problems that arise when the producers try to make a show \"fresh\" again.<ref>Alberti, p. 143</ref> The show mainly deals with themes commonly known as \"[[jumping the shark]]\", instances that usually occur when a failing show adds a new character or major plot twist to boost ratings. The first theme is a commentary on adding a new character, when the show has run for too long. Usually, this is a technique used in shows that involve children who have grown up. This was the case with \"Oliver\" on ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' and \"Luke Brower\" on ''[[Growing Pains]]''. The technique is also used in cartoons, notably with the addition of ''[[Scrappy-Doo]]'' to the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' animated series ten years after its debut.<ref name=\"ScrappyDays\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/writings/scrappy-days/|title=Scrappy Days: The Birth of Scrappy-Doo and What I Had to Do with It |first=Mark|last=Evanier|authorlink=Mark Evanier|publisher=Newsfromme.com |date=|access-date=April 8, 2019}}</ref> Both Poochie and Roy are used to reflect this by attempting to keep ''The Itchy and Scratchy Show'' and the Simpson family fresh respectively.<ref name=\"Alberti, p. 144\">Alberti, p. 144</ref>\n\nAnother theme is the notion of network executives forcing ideas onto a show. The interaction between the writers and the network executives in the episode underscore the differences between them. The writers understand the show's inner workings, but the network executives approach improvements to the show from a business point of view. They try to incorporate what they see as a rebellious character with the comment \"This is popular with the kids\", but the viewers later reject the character.<ref>Alberti, pp. 145\u2013147</ref> The writers themselves are satirized in the episode, and are depicted as lazy and pretentious with few original ideas.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=297\u2013299}}\n\nThe last theme is the viewer backlash and obsession with internal consistency. When [[Comic Book Guy]] sees the Poochie episode, he immediately goes on the Internet and writes \"Worst episode ever\" on a message board; a commentary on how the active audience nit picks the episode. The writers respond by using the voice of Bart:<ref name=\"fans\">Alberti, pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\n:Bart: Hey, I know it wasn't great, but what right do you have to complain?\n:Comic Book Guy: As a loyal viewer, I feel they owe me.\n:Bart: What? They've given you thousands of hours of entertainment for free. What could they possibly owe you? I mean, if anything, ''you'' owe ''them''!\n:Comic Book Guy: ...Worst episode ever.\n\nEarlier in the episode, Homer and June Bellamy attend an in-store appearance as part of the promotion for the new character Poochie. They are asked a question of internal consistency, like the show's fans do all the time; Homer says to the fan who asks the question, \"Why would a man whose shirt says 'Genius at Work' spend all his time watching a children's cartoon show?\" This is again a reflection on how the writers feel about the fans obsessing about internal consistency.<ref name=\"fans\"/>\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe original opening [[couch gag]] shows a [[pastiche]] of the cover collage from the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]' 1967 album ''[[Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', which was first used earlier in the season for \"[[Bart After Dark]]\".<ref name=\"BBC\"/> Otherwise, the episode refers to other TV shows, including the syndicated couch gag featuring the [[The Flintstones#The Flintstones|Flintstone family]], recycled from the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]] episode \"[[Kamp Krusty]]\", to mark ''The Simpsons'' surpassing ''The Flintstones'' as the longest-running animated series.<ref name=\"IGNreview\">{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/883/883399p1.html|title=The Simpsons Flashback: \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\" Review|first=Robert|last=Canning|date=2008-06-23|access-date=2008-06-23|website=[[IGN]]|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Roy calls Homer and Marge Mr. and Mrs. S, which echoes [[Fonzie]] calling the Cunninghams \"Mr. and Mrs. C\" on ''[[Happy Days]]''.

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on February 9, 1997.{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=226-227}} In the episode, ''[[The Itchy & Scratchy Show]]'' attempts to regain lost viewers by introducing a new character named Poochie, voiced by [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]. The episode is largely self-referential and satirizes the world of television production, fans of ''The Simpsons'', and the series itself. It was written by [[David X. Cohen]] and directed by [[Steven Dean Moore]]. [[Alex Rocco]] is a credited guest voice as [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Roger Meyers Jr.|Roger Meyers, Jr.]] for the third and final time (having previously provided the character's voice in \"[[Itchy & Scratchy & Marge]]\" and \"[[The Day the Violence Died]]\"); [[Phil Hartman]] also guest stars as [[Troy McClure]].{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=226-227}} Poochie would become a minor recurring character and [[Comic Book Guy]]'s catchphrase, \"Worst episode ever\", is introduced in this episode. With \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\", the show's 167th episode, ''The Simpsons'' surpassed ''[[The Flintstones]]'' in the number of episodes produced for a prime-time [[animated series]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Krusty the Clown]] threatens to ditch ''[[The Itchy & Scratchy Show]]'' because the cartoon causes his ratings to nosedive during that segment of his show. Cartoon producer [[Itchy & Scratchy Show#Roger Meyers, Jr.|Roger Meyers]] convenes a [[focus group]] to discover why ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'' has lost its appeal. In the focus group, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] explains that the show has lost its impact on audiences after being on the air for so long. \n\nMeyers decides that the cartoon needs a new character: Poochie, a dog with \"attitude\" who surfs, raps, and plays electric guitar. At [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and Lisa's suggestion, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] auditions for Poochie's voice and gets the part. To promote Poochie, he and voice actor June Bellamy make several publicity stops, where they encounter the show's hardcore fans. Homer invites his friends and relatives to watch the first ''Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show''. However, the cartoon is full of asinine antics, with none of the show's flair or trademark violence. Unimpressed by the manic Poochie character, Homer's friends say little as they leave.\n\nMeyers decides to kill off Poochie, but Homer resolves to save him. At the next recording session, Homer goes off-script and implores the audience to give Poochie a chance. The show's production team appears moved by Homer's plea, but when the episode airs, Meyers has dubbed over Homer's voice: the new dialogue says that Poochie has \"died on the way back to his home planet\". The studio audience cheers as Krusty displays an [[affidavit]] swearing Poochie will never return. Homer feels betrayed but attributes the whole affair to the fickle nature of show business.\n\n==Production==\n\"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\" was written by [[David X. Cohen]] and directed by [[Steven Dean Moore]].{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=226-227}} The episode was conceived as a commentary on what it was like to work on a television show that had long been on the air, but was considered to be nearing its end. This was intended to show that ''The Simpsons'' could still be good after eight seasons, even though it no longer had the \"shock value\" it did in the early years.<ref name=Cohencom>{{cite video |people=Cohen, David |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Before production of season eight began, several executives at Fox suggested the staff add a new character to the show, who would live with the Simpsons on a permanent basis, in a bid to freshen up the series.<ref name=Groeningcom>{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/silverman.asp |title=Family Matters - The David Silverman Interview |work=[[MSNBC]] |author=Tom Heintjes |accessdate=August 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217065814/http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/silverman.asp |archivedate=February 17, 2010}}</ref> The writers found the suggestion, usually considered a sign of desperation to boost a flagging series,<ref name=\"Alberti, p. 144\"/> amusing, therefore much of the episode revolves around this trope. Parallel to the episode's main plot, where Poochie is introduced on ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'' to boost its ratings, the writers inserted the one-time character Roy, a college-aged man who is shown to be living with the Simpsons, with no explanation as to his character or presence, as a reference to the executives' proposal.<ref name=Smithcom>{{cite video |people=Smith, Yeardley |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Roy was originally conceived for the \"Time and Punishment\" segment of the [[The Simpsons (season 6)|season six]] episode \"[[Treehouse of Horror V]]\", living with the Simpsons in one of the alternate realities,<ref name=Cohencom/> as a second, teenage son in the family.<ref name=\"Daniels\">{{cite video |people=Daniels, Greg |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Sixth Season DVD commentary for the episode \"Treehouse of Horror V\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\nCohen's initial vision for Poochie was that he would be annoying to fans because he was wealthy, aloof and unlikeable. In the episode's DVD commentary he read his script for the first cartoon featuring Itchy, Scratchy, and Poochie:\n{{Cquote|Itchy and Scratchy are laborers in Poochie's gold mine. Poochie sits on a velvet throne surrounded by [[Money bag|bags of money]]. He drinks champagne as he whips Itchy and Scratchy and lectures them on the value of hard work in a capitalist society. Finally, Itchy and Scratchy get fed up and plan their revenge. They decide Scratchy will present a fake money bag to Poochie. Itchy will secretly be hiding in the bag. When Poochie raises the bag to inhale the sweet smell of money, Itchy will jab him in the nose with a syringe of poison. Itchy gets in the bag and Scratchy presents it to Poochie, but the plan backfires because Poochie is offended by how small the money bag is. To demonstrate how worthless it is to him, he sets it on fire and uses it to light his cigar. Itchy's flaming skeleton falls out of the burning bag, and the syringe lands on Scratchy's toe and kills him, too. Poochie says, \"Oh, well, I can always use my millions of dollars to hire more workers. That's the power of money.\" The end.<ref name=Cohencom/>}}\n\nAs with other episodes centering on the production of ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'', such as \"[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]\", the show's staff are shown. Almost all of them are based on the actual staff of ''The Simpsons''.<ref name=Cohencom/> In the first scene at the production table the person in the lower right corner, wearing a squid T-shirt, is Cohen. On the left side, the furthest away is [[Bill Oakley]] with [[Josh Weinstein]] next to him. Next to Weinstein is [[George Meyer]], who is the writer who speaks out and gets fired. The animator shown designing Poochie is supervising director [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]]. As Silverman plays the [[tuba]], one was drawn into the background of the scene. Other writers who appear include [[Dan McGrath]], [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]], [[Donick Cary]], [[Ron Hauge]], [[Ned Goldreyer]], and [[Mike Scully]], who had to be added in later, as the animators did not have a photo to use as a likeness.<ref name=Cohencom/>\n\nThis episode also features the first use of [[Comic Book Guy]]'s catchphrase \"Worst. Episode. Ever.\", which was taken from the [[alt.tv.simpsons]] newsgroup.<ref name=Cohencom/>\n\n==Themes==\nThis episode saw ''The Simpsons'' surpass ''[[The Flintstones]]'' for the number of episodes produced for an [[animated series]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,290859,00.html |title=1997 Timeline |accessdate=March 13, 2007 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Marlene |last=McCampbell |date=December 26, 1997}}</ref> The episode therefore deals with the issue of longevity and the problems that arise when the producers try to make a show \"fresh\" again.<ref>Alberti, p. 143</ref> The show mainly deals with themes commonly known as \"[[jumping the shark]]\", instances that usually occur when a failing show adds a new character or major plot twist to boost ratings. The first theme is a commentary on adding a new character, when the show has run for too long. Usually, this is a technique used in shows that involve children who have grown up. This was the case with \"Oliver\" on ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' and \"Luke Brower\" on ''[[Growing Pains]]''. The technique is also used in cartoons, notably with the addition of ''[[Scrappy-Doo]]'' to the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' animated series ten years after its debut.<ref name=\"ScrappyDays\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/writings/scrappy-days/|title=Scrappy Days: The Birth of Scrappy-Doo and What I Had to Do with It |first=Mark|last=Evanier|authorlink=Mark Evanier|publisher=Newsfromme.com |date=|access-date=April 8, 2019}}</ref> Both Poochie and Roy are used to reflect this by attempting to keep ''The Itchy and Scratchy Show'' and the Simpson family fresh respectively.<ref name=\"Alberti, p. 144\">Alberti, p. 144</ref>\n\nAnother theme is the notion of network executives forcing ideas onto a show. The interaction between the writers and the network executives in the episode underscore the differences between them. The writers understand the show's inner workings, but the network executives approach improvements to the show from a business point of view. They try to incorporate what they see as a rebellious character with the comment \"This is popular with the kids\", but the viewers later reject the character.<ref>Alberti, pp. 145-147</ref> The writers themselves are satirized in the episode, and are depicted as lazy and pretentious with few original ideas.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=297-299}}\n\nThe last theme is the viewer backlash and obsession with internal consistency. When [[Comic Book Guy]] sees the Poochie episode, he immediately goes on the Internet and writes \"Worst episode ever\" on a message board; a commentary on how the active audience nit picks the episode. The writers respond by using the voice of Bart:<ref name=\"fans\">Alberti, pp. 147-148</ref>\n\n:Bart: Hey, I know it wasn't great, but what right do you have to complain?\n:Comic Book Guy: As a loyal viewer, I feel they owe me.\n:Bart: What? They've given you thousands of hours of entertainment for free. What could they possibly owe you? I mean, if anything, ''you'' owe ''them''!\n:Comic Book Guy: ...Worst episode ever.\n\nEarlier in the episode, Homer and June Bellamy attend an in-store appearance as part of the promotion for the new character Poochie. They are asked a question of internal consistency, like the show's fans do all the time; Homer says to the fan who asks the question, \"Why would a man whose shirt says 'Genius at Work' spend all his time watching a children's cartoon show?\" This is again a reflection on how the writers feel about the fans obsessing about internal consistency.<ref name=\"fans\"/>\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe original opening [[couch gag]] shows a [[pastiche]] of the cover collage from the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]' 1967 album ''[[Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', which was first used earlier in the season for \"[[Bart After Dark]]\".<ref name=\"BBC\"/> Otherwise, the episode refers to other TV shows, including the syndicated couch gag featuring the [[The Flintstones#The Flintstones|Flintstone family]], recycled from the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]] episode \"[[Kamp Krusty]]\", to mark ''The Simpsons'' surpassing ''The Flintstones'' as the longest-running animated series.<ref name=\"IGNreview\">{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/883/883399p1.html|title=The Simpsons Flashback: \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\" Review|first=Robert|last=Canning|date=2008-06-23|access-date=2008-06-23|website=[[IGN]]|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Roy calls Homer and Marge Mr. and Mrs. S, which echoes [[Fonzie]] calling the Cunninghams \"Mr. and Mrs. C\" on ''[[Happy Days]]''.

It features the final regular appearance of [[Peter Capaldi]] as the [[Twelfth Doctor]], the first official appearance of [[Jodie Whittaker]] as the [[Thirteenth Doctor]], and guest-stars [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] as the [[First Doctor]], having previously portrayed original First Doctor actor [[William Hartnell]] in the 2013 docudrama ''[[An Adventure in Space and Time]]''. [[Pearl Mackie]] guest stars as the Twelfth Doctor's former companion [[Bill Potts (Doctor Who)|Bill Potts]], while his other companions make guest appearances \u2013\n[[Jenna Coleman]] as [[Clara Oswald]] and [[Matt Lucas]] as [[Nardole]].\n\nThis episode is a continuation of events after \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\", addressing the cliffhanger that it ended on, and takes place during the final story of the [[First Doctor]]; footage from the 1966 serial ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'', is used in the special. \"Twice Upon a Time\" is Capaldi's fourth and final Christmas special as the Twelfth Doctor, and the last ''Doctor Who'' story to be written and produced by Moffat, who had served as the show's executive producer and chief writer since taking over from [[Russell T Davies]] in 2010. After the special's broadcast, Moffat was succeeded as executive producer and showrunner by [[Chris Chibnall]]. It is also the last episode to have music composed by [[Murray Gold]], who had composed music for Doctor Who since the series' revival in 2005. From [[Doctor Who (series 11)|series 11]], music was composed by [[Segun Akinola]].\n\nThe special has received generally positive reviews from critics, with some criticism has been directed towards the episode's representation of the First Doctor.\n\n==Plot==\n=== Synopsis ===\nWandering back to his [[TARDIS]] through the South Pole in 1986 after leaving his companions behind, the [[First Doctor]] refuses to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]]. He encounters the [[Twelfth Doctor]] outside his own TARDIS in a similar state of mind. The pair are soon approached by a confused and injured [[World War I|First World War]] British captain, displaced from December 1914 while in a gun-point stalemate with a German soldier. All three are then forcibly taken into a large spaceship. Inside, they meet with [[Bill Potts (Doctor Who)|Bill]]; the Twelfth Doctor, however, doubts she is the real Bill. Upon encountering the ship's glass-like [[Holography|holographic]] pilot, they are offered freedom in exchange for allowing the ship to return the Captain to the moment of his death. Refusing to allow the Captain to die, they escape and take the First Doctor's TARDIS to the planet Villengard in the far future.\n\nAlone, the Twelfth Doctor meets with the rogue Dalek [[Into the Dalek|Rusty]], who has taken refuge from other Daleks hunting it. Given access to the Dalek Hivemind, the Doctor learns that the pilot and its ship, known as ''Testimony'', were created on New Earth, designed to extract people from their timelines at the moment of their death, and archive their memories into glass avatars. \"Bill\" is one such avatar, created from her memories. Seeing no evil to fight, the Doctors agree to return the Captain to his timeline. Upon arrival, the Captain asks the Doctors to keep an eye on his family, introducing himself as Archibald Hamish Lethbridge-Stewart, implying that he is the ancestor of the Doctor's frequent ally and lifelong friend the [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart|Brigadier]].  As time resumes, the Doctors watch as soldiers on both sides begin singing \"[[Silent Night]]\". The Twelfth Doctor explains to the First that he deliberately shifted the Captain's timeline to the start of the [[Christmas truce]], to ensure his life would be spared.\n\nWith the Captain saved, the First Doctor informs the Twelfth that he is prepared to regenerate and says his goodbyes before returning to his TARDIS. Now alone with Bill's avatar, the Twelfth Doctor adamantly contends she is not really Bill, but she argues that memories are what define a person. Bill's avatar restores the Doctor's memories of [[Clara Oswald]] before they are joined by [[Nardole]]'s avatar. The Doctor, however, refuses to give the avatars testimony of his life. They respect his wish to be alone and leave after he embraces them both. The Doctor then returns to the TARDIS and decides it's now time to regenerate, but not before relaying advice to his next incarnation.\n\nAfter the newly regenerated [[Thirteenth Doctor]] examines her reflection, the TARDIS suffers multiple system failures due to damage caused by the delayed regeneration. Falling out of the tumbling ship, the Doctor watches in horror as the time rotor and the console room explode, and the TARDIS dematerialises while she plummets towards the Earth below.\n\n=== Continuity ===\n\"Twice Upon a Time\" takes place towards the end of the First Doctor's final serial, ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'' (first broadcast in October 1966), some of which is shown at the start of the special. During the last episode's final moments, the Doctor leaves his companions [[Ben Jackson (Doctor Who)|Ben]] and [[Polly (Doctor Who)|Polly]] and returns to the TARDIS; they find him collapsed in the console room, where he undergoes his first regeneration. [[Derek Martinus]], the episode's director, reportedly cut a line from the original script which suggested that the Doctor was refusing to give in to the regeneration process. Steven Moffat's 2017 story creates an extended narrative around that part of the story, in which the First Doctor delays his regeneration and encounters his future self \u2014 the Twelfth Doctor \u2014 in the snowy wasteland.<ref name=\"denofgeek\">{{cite web|last1=Dillon-Trenchard|first1=Peter|title=Doctor Who: geeky spots & references in Twice Upon A Time|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/twice-upon-a-time/54180/doctor-who-geeky-spots-references-in-twice-upon-a-time|website=Den of Geek|accessdate=26 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226193632/http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/twice-upon-a-time/54180/doctor-who-geeky-spots-references-in-twice-upon-a-time|archivedate=26 December 2017|language=en|date=25 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian-martin\">{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Daniel|title=Doctor Who Christmas special 2017: Twice Upon a Time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/25/doctor-who-christmas-special-2017-twice-upon-a-time|website=The Guardian|accessdate=26 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226194106/https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/25/doctor-who-christmas-special-2017-twlewice-upon-a-time|archivedate=26 December 2017|date=25 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen Testimony shows the First Doctor images of his future incarnations, clips from both the classic series and the revival are used, including the [[Third Doctor]] from ''[[Invasion of the Dinosaurs]]'' (1974);

It features the final regular appearance of [[Peter Capaldi]] as the [[Twelfth Doctor]], the first official appearance of [[Jodie Whittaker]] as the [[Thirteenth Doctor]], and guest-stars [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] as the [[First Doctor]], having previously portrayed original First Doctor actor [[William Hartnell]] in the 2013 docudrama ''[[An Adventure in Space and Time]]''. [[Pearl Mackie]] guest stars as the Twelfth Doctor's former companion [[Bill Potts (Doctor Who)|Bill Potts]], while his other companions make guest appearances \u2013\n[[Jenna Coleman]] as [[Clara Oswald]] and [[Matt Lucas]] as [[Nardole]].\n\nThis episode is a continuation of events after \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\", addressing the cliffhanger that it ended on, and takes place during the final story of the [[First Doctor]]; footage from the 1966 serial ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'', is used in the special. \"Twice Upon a Time\" is Capaldi's fourth and final Christmas special as the Twelfth Doctor, and the last ''Doctor Who'' story to be written and produced by Moffat, who had served as the show's executive producer and chief writer since taking over from [[Russell T Davies]] in 2010. After the special's broadcast, Moffat was succeeded as executive producer and showrunner by [[Chris Chibnall]]. It is also the last episode to have music composed by [[Murray Gold]], who had composed music for Doctor Who since the series' revival in 2005. From [[Doctor Who (series 11)|series 11]], music was composed by [[Segun Akinola]].\n\nThe special has received generally positive reviews from critics, with some criticism has been directed towards the episode's representation of the First Doctor.\n\n==Plot==\n=== Synopsis ===\nWandering back to his [[TARDIS]] through the South Pole in 1986 after leaving his companions behind, the [[First Doctor]] refuses to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]]. He encounters the [[Twelfth Doctor]] outside his own TARDIS in a similar state of mind. The pair are soon approached by a confused and injured [[World War I|First World War]] British captain, displaced from December 1914 while in a gun-point stalemate with a German soldier. All three are then forcibly taken into a large spaceship. Inside, they meet with [[Bill Potts (Doctor Who)|Bill]]; the Twelfth Doctor, however, doubts she is the real Bill. Upon encountering the ship's glass-like [[Holography|holographic]] pilot, they are offered freedom in exchange for allowing the ship to return the Captain to the moment of his death. Refusing to allow the Captain to die, they escape and take the First Doctor's TARDIS to the planet Villengard in the far future.\n\nAlone, the Twelfth Doctor meets with the rogue Dalek [[Into the Dalek|Rusty]], who has taken refuge from other Daleks hunting it. Given access to the Dalek Hivemind, the Doctor learns that the pilot and its ship, known as ''Testimony'', were created on New Earth, designed to extract people from their timelines at the moment of their death, and archive their memories into glass avatars. \"Bill\" is one such avatar, created from her memories. Seeing no evil to fight, the Doctors agree to return the Captain to his timeline. Upon arrival, the Captain asks the Doctors to keep an eye on his family, introducing himself as Archibald Hamish Lethbridge-Stewart, implying that he is the ancestor of the Doctor's frequent ally and lifelong friend the [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart|Brigadier]].  As time resumes, the Doctors watch as soldiers on both sides begin singing \"[[Silent Night]]\". The Twelfth Doctor explains to the First that he deliberately shifted the Captain's timeline to the start of the [[Christmas truce]], to ensure his life would be spared.\n\nWith the Captain saved, the First Doctor informs the Twelfth that he is prepared to regenerate and says his goodbyes before returning to his TARDIS. Now alone with Bill's avatar, the Twelfth Doctor adamantly contends she is not really Bill, but she argues that memories are what define a person. Bill's avatar restores the Doctor's memories of [[Clara Oswald]] before they are joined by [[Nardole]]'s avatar. The Doctor, however, refuses to give the avatars testimony of his life. They respect his wish to be alone and leave after he embraces them both. The Doctor then returns to the TARDIS and decides it's now time to regenerate, but not before relaying advice to his next incarnation.\n\nAfter the newly regenerated [[Thirteenth Doctor]] examines her reflection, the TARDIS suffers multiple system failures due to damage caused by the delayed regeneration. Falling out of the tumbling ship, the Doctor watches in horror as the time rotor and the console room explode, and the TARDIS dematerialises while she plummets towards the Earth below.\n\n=== Continuity ===\n\"Twice Upon a Time\" takes place towards the end of the First Doctor's final serial, ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'' (first broadcast in October 1966), some of which is shown at the start of the special. During the last episode's final moments, the Doctor leaves his companions [[Ben Jackson (Doctor Who)|Ben]] and [[Polly (Doctor Who)|Polly]] and returns to the TARDIS; they find him collapsed in the console room, where he undergoes his first regeneration. [[Derek Martinus]], the episode's director, reportedly cut a line from the original script which suggested that the Doctor was refusing to give in to the regeneration process. Steven Moffat's 2017 story creates an extended narrative around that part of the story, in which the First Doctor delays his regeneration and encounters his future self \u2014 the Twelfth Doctor \u2014 in the snowy wasteland.<ref name=\"denofgeek\">{{cite web|last1=Dillon-Trenchard|first1=Peter|title=Doctor Who: geeky spots & references in Twice Upon A Time|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/twice-upon-a-time/54180/doctor-who-geeky-spots-references-in-twice-upon-a-time|website=Den of Geek|accessdate=26 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226193632/http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/twice-upon-a-time/54180/doctor-who-geeky-spots-references-in-twice-upon-a-time|archivedate=26 December 2017|language=en|date=25 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian-martin\">{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Daniel|title=Doctor Who Christmas special 2017: Twice Upon a Time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/25/doctor-who-christmas-special-2017-twice-upon-a-time|website=The Guardian|accessdate=26 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226194106/https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/25/doctor-who-christmas-special-2017-twlewice-upon-a-time|archivedate=26 December 2017|date=25 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen Testimony shows the First Doctor images of his future incarnations, clips from both the classic series and the revival are used, including the [[Third Doctor]] from ''[[Invasion of the Dinosaurs]]'' (1974);

The latest game in the main series, ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'', was released on iOS and Android in September 2019. The series has sold over 100 million copies worldwide to date.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mario kart first logo.png|thumb|right|The original logo, used up until ''Mario Kart Arcade GP 2'']]\nThe first title in the ''Mario Kart'' series, ''[[Super Mario Kart]],'' was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1992. The development of the first game was overseen by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the Japanese video game designer who created the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' as well as many other successful games for Nintendo. Darran Jones of [[Imagine Publishing|NowGamer]] suggests that the original success of ''Super Mario Kart'' was the result of including characters previously seen in ''Mario Bros.'' games, while also being a new type of racing game.<ref name=\"Now Gamer\">{{cite web|title=Super Mario Kart: The Complete History of Nintendo's Kart Racer |url=http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1148204/super_mario_kart_the_complete_history_of_nintendos_kart_racer.html |last=Jones |first=Darran |work=[[NowGamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing|Imagine Publishing Ltd.]] |date=November 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625232227/http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1148204/super_mario_kart_the_complete_history_of_nintendos_kart_racer.html |archivedate=June 25, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:MK8 Mario Circuit.jpg|thumb|right|Mario driving upside-down using the anti-gravity mechanic introduced in ''[[Mario Kart 8]]''.]]\nIn the ''Mario Kart'' series, players compete in [[Kart racing|go-kart races]], controlling one of a selection of characters, typically from the ''Mario'' franchise. Up to twelve characters can compete in each race; the exact number varies between games.\n\nOne of the features of the series is the use of various [[power-up]] items obtained by driving into item boxes laid out on the course. These power-ups include [[Super Mario (series)#Mushrooms|mushrooms]] to give players a speed boost, [[Koopa Troopa|Koopa]] Shells to be thrown at opponents, [[banana peel]]s and fake item boxes that can be laid on the course as hazards. The type of weapon received from an item box is influenced by the player's current position in the race.<ref name=WM>{{cite web|last=Dan|title=Mario Kart Franchise Retrospective|url=http://www.watchmojo.com/video/title/Mario%20Kart%20Franchise%20Retrospective/|publisher=[[WatchMojo.com]]|accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> For example, players lagging far behind may receive more powerful items, such as Bullet Bills which give the player a bigger speed boost depending on the place of the player, while the leader may only receive small defensive items, such as shells or bananas. Called [[Dynamic game difficulty balancing|rubber banding]], this gameplay mechanism allows other players or computers a realistic chance to catch up to the leading player. They can also perform driving techniques during the race such as rocket starts, [[slipstream]]ing, and mini-turbos.\n\nAs the series has progressed, each new installment has introduced new gameplay elements, such as new circuits, items, modes, and playable characters.<ref name=WM/> These changes include:\n\n* ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' introduces 4-player racing, slipstreaming<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mariowiki.com/Slipstreaming|title=Slipstreaming|website=Super Mario Wiki|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> and [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=WM/> This game also introduced [[Wario]] and [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] as playable characters, as well as seven new items: the Fake Item Box, Triple Red Shell, Triple Green Shell, Triple Mushroom, Banana Bunch, Golden Mushroom, and the infamous [[blue shell]]. In addition to the three Grand Prix engine classes, Mirror mode is introduced (tracks are flipped laterally) in 100cc.\n* ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' introduces the ability to unlock all of the ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' tracks, as both games use the same [[mode 7]] principle.\n* ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' features [[co-operative]] [[LAN]] play and two-player karts.<ref name=WM/> It also introduces eleven new playable characters ([[Princess Daisy]], [[Birdo]], Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Paratroopa, [[Diddy Kong]], [[Bowser Jr.]], [[Waluigi]], [[Toadette]], [[List of Mario franchise characters#Petey Piranha|Petey Piranha]], and [[King Boo]]). The game also features special items that are specific to each character, a feature that was previously accessible only to computer-controlled drivers in the original game and re-introduced in ''Mario Kart Tour''. Finally, this game introduced unlockable characters and karts to the series. Mirror mode is bumped up to 150cc.\n* ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' features [[dual-screen]] play and introduces [[online multiplayer]] (via [[Wi-Fi]]) & retro battle arenas. Shy Guy (exclusive to [[DS Download Play]]), Dry Bones, and [[R.O.B.]] are introduced as playable characters. ''DS'' was also the first ''Mario Kart'' game to feature retro tracks from all previous titles of the series, as well as the first entry in the series to feature mission mode. It also introduces two new items: the Blooper, which temporarily obscures the screens of players in higher places with ink and Bullet Bill, which is given to players in lower places and grants a larger speed boost depending on the position from first place.\n* ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' introduces motion controls, performing tricks, 12-player racing, and [[motorbikes]].<ref name=\"Mario Kart Wii Details\">{{cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/news/mario-kart-wii-detailed | title=Mario Kart Wii Detailed | publisher=1up.com | date=February 6, 2008 | accessdate=May 21, 2013 | author=Sato, Yoshi | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192825/http://www.1up.com/news/mario-kart-wii-detailed | archivedate=October 29, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Six new playable characters were introduced: Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina]], Funky Kong, Dry Bowser, and two outfits for [[Mii]] characters.

Alternate outfits for certain characters are also available as rare items.

Most are based on existing areas in the ''Mario'' franchise ([[Mushroom Kingdom#Bowser's Castle|Bowser's Castle]] being among the most prominent), but there are a number of courses that have not appeared elsewhere, yet still belong in the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], such as Rainbow Road, which usually takes place above a city or in space.<ref name=WM/> Each game in the series (following the original game) includes at least 16 original courses and up to 6 original battle arenas.<ref name=WM/> Each game's tracks are divided into four \"cups\", or groups in which the player has to have the highest overall placing to win and they are the Mushroom Cup, the Flower Cup, the Star Cup, and the Special Cup. Most courses can be done in three laps, except in the original game where all circuits required five laps to finish, seven in ''Mario Kart: Double Dash!!'' when racing on Baby Park, and ''Mario Kart Tour'' with only two. The first game to feature courses from previous games was ''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'', which contained all of the tracks from the original Super NES game. Starting with ''Mario Kart DS'', each entry in the series has featured 16 \"nitro\" (brand new courses introduced for said game) and 16 \"retro\" tracks (reappearing courses from previous ''Mario Kart'' games), spread across four cups each with four races. The four Retro Grand Prix cups are the Shell Cup, the Banana Cup, the Leaf Cup, and the Lightning Cup. In ''Mario Kart 8'', 16 additional tracks are available across two [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] packages, eight for each package downloaded, including seven retro courses, four original courses, and five courses based on other Nintendo franchises, including ''[[Excitebike]]'', ''[[F-Zero]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' divided into four additional cups; the Egg Cup, the [[Triforce]] Cup, the Crossing Cup, and the Bell Cup.<ref name=\"MK8 DLC\">{{cite web|last=Farokhmanesh|first=Megan|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/26/6071823/mario-kart-8-link-animal-crossing-dlc|title=Link, F-Zero and Animal Crossing are coming to Mario Kart 8 as DLC|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 26, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2014}}</ref> ''Mario Kart Tour'' introduced courses from around the world including [[Paris]], [[Tokyo]], [[London]], [[Vancouver]], and [[New York City]].\n\n===Modes of play===\nEach installment features a variety of different modes.

Before ''Mario Kart 8'' there were four difficulties: 50[[Cubic centimeter|cc]], 100cc, 150cc, and 150cc Mirror (courses that see their circuits flipped horizontally, originally 100cc Mirror in ''Mario Kart 64''). ''Mario Kart 8'' added a fifth difficulty level: 200cc. Players earn points according to their finishing position in each race and the placement order gets carried over as the starting grid for the next race. At the end of the cup, the top three players with the most points overall will receive a [[trophy]] in bronze, silver, and gold.\n* '''[[Time trial|Time Trials]]''' \u2013 The player races alone in order to finish any course in the fastest time possible. The best time is then saved as a [[Ghost (video gaming)|ghost]], which the player can race against in later trials. Since ''Mario Kart: Double Dash'', a new function called Staff Ghosts is introduced, Staff Ghosts are members of the Nintendo development team that set staff times for players to try and beat. Upon success, players will unlock Expert Staff Ghosts, which only appeared in ''Mario Kart Wii'' and ''Mario Kart 7'', which unlock characters, vehicles, or stamps once beaten, in addition to viewing ghost data.\n* '''VS Race''' \u2013 Multiple human players race against each other on any course with customized rules such as team racing and item frequency. The mode also includes [[single-player]] VS races and CPU controlled players to compete in VS races as well since ''Mario Kart DS'' (except for ''Mario Kart 7''). ''Super Circuit'', however, features a Quick Run mode, which shares similarities with VS mode.\n* '''Battle''' \u2013 Multiple human players use in-game offensive items (shells, etc.) to battle each other in a closed arena. Each player starts with three [[balloons]] and loses a balloon with every hit sustained; the last player possessing at least one balloon wins. Different battle types were added as the series progressed, as well as single-player battles with CPU controlled players. Starting with ''Mario Kart Wii'', there is a [[Time limit (video gaming)|time limit]] for each battle. For ''Mario Kart 8'', the battles take place on race courses. ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' reintroduces dedicated arenas.\n*'''Online Multiplayer''' \u2013 Players are able to compete in races and battles through online services, such as [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], [[Nintendo Network]], and [[Nintendo Switch Online]]. Players can also share Time Trial ghosts, and participate in [[tournament]]s. In races and battles, players are matched by VR (VS Rating) and BR (Battle Rating) respectively, which is a number between 0 and 99,999 (only 9,999 in ''Mario Kart Wii''). Players gain or lose points based on their performance in a race or battle. The game attempts to match players with a similar rating.\n\n==List of ''Mario Kart'' games==\n{{VG timeline\n|range1 = 1992-\n|range1_color = #6cbe45 #218800\n| 1992 = ''[[Super Mario Kart]]''\n| 1995 = ''[[VB Mario Kart]]'' (Cancelled)\n| 1996 = ''[[Mario Kart 64]]''\n| 2001 = ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]''\n| 2003 = ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]''\n| 2005a = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP]]''\n| 2005b = ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' \n| 2007 = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP 2]]''\n| 2008 = ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]''\n| 2011 = ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''\n| 2013 = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP DX]]''\n| 2014 = ''[[Mario Kart 8]]''\n| 2017a = ''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]''\n| 2017b = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP VR]]''\n| 2019 = ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]''\n}}\n\n===Console games=== <!-- includes home and handheld; shortened for brevity -->\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 40em; text-align: center\"\n! rowspan = \"2\" | Year !! rowspan=\"2\" | Game !! rowspan=\"2\" | Platform !! colspan=\"5\" |[[Virtual Console]]/<br />[[Nintendo Switch Online]] re-release\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Wii !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Wii U !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | 3DS !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | New 3DS !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Switch\n|-\n| 1992 || ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' || [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}}\n|-\n| 1996 ||''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' || [[Nintendo 64|N64]] || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2001 || ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' || [[Game Boy Advance|GBA]] || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Partial|<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\"/>}} || {{Partial|<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\"/>}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2003 || ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' || [[GameCube|GCN]] || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2005 || ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' || [[Nintendo DS|DS]] || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2008 || ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' || [[Wii]] || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2011 || ''[[Mario Kart 7]]'' || [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]] || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2014 ||''[[Mario Kart 8]]'' || [[Wii U]]|| {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2017 ||''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]'' || [[Nintendo Switch|Switch]] || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}}\n|}\n{{legend|#D2FFD2|text=[[File:Green check.svg|13px]]|Available on Virtual Console or Nintendo Switch Online}}\n{{legend|#FFB|text={{Dagger}}|Available by using backwards compatibility}}\n{{legend|#DDFBFF|text={{Double-dagger}}|Available natively on the console}}\n{{Reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\">''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'' can be played on Nintendo 3DS systems that feature the Nintendo 3DS Ambassadors program.</ref>\n}}\n\n===Arcade games===\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP|Mario Kart Arcade GP]]'' (2005, [[Arcade game|Arcade]]) (Co-developed by [[Namco]])\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP 2|Mario Kart Arcade GP 2]]'' (2007, Arcade) (Co-developed by [[Namco Bandai Games]])\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP DX|Mario Kart Arcade GP DX]]'' (2013, Arcade) (Co-developed by Namco Bandai Games)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arcadeheroes.com/2013/02/05/namco-formally-announces-mario-kart-arcade-grand-prix-dx/|title=Namco Formally Announces Mario Kart Arcade Grand Prix DX - Arcade Heroes|date=February 5, 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP VR|Mario Kart Arcade GP VR]]'' (2017, Arcade) (by [[Bandai Namco Studios]])<ref name=VRZone>{{cite web|url=http://vrzone-pic.com/en/activity/mariocart.html|title=MARIO KART ARCADE GP VR - VR ZONE SHINJUKU|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoeverything.com/mario-kart-arcade-gp-vr-announced-for-bandai-namcos-virtual-reality-arcade-played-with-htc-vive/|title=Mario Kart Arcade GP VR announced for Bandai Namco's virtual reality arcade, played with HTC Vive - Nintendo Everything|date=June 13, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Mobile games===\n* ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'' (2019)\n\n===Canceled games===\n* ''VB Mario Kart'' was scheduled for the [[Virtual Boy]] in 1995.

Retrieved January 27, 2012.</ref>\n\nWith six ''Mario Kart'' games released on home consoles, three on portable handheld consoles, four arcade games co-developed with [[Namco]] and one for mobile phones, the ''Mario Kart'' series includes a total of fourteen entries. The latest game in the main series, ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'', was released on iOS and Android in September 2019. The series has sold over 100 million copies worldwide to date.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mario kart first logo.png|thumb|right|The original logo, used up until ''Mario Kart Arcade GP 2'']]\nThe first title in the ''Mario Kart'' series, ''[[Super Mario Kart]],'' was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1992. The development of the first game was overseen by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the Japanese video game designer who created the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' as well as many other successful games for Nintendo. Darran Jones of [[Imagine Publishing|NowGamer]] suggests that the original success of ''Super Mario Kart'' was the result of including characters previously seen in ''Mario Bros.'' games, while also being a new type of racing game.<ref name=\"Now Gamer\">{{cite web|title=Super Mario Kart: The Complete History of Nintendo's Kart Racer |url=http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1148204/super_mario_kart_the_complete_history_of_nintendos_kart_racer.html |last=Jones |first=Darran |work=[[NowGamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing|Imagine Publishing Ltd.]] |date=November 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625232227/http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1148204/super_mario_kart_the_complete_history_of_nintendos_kart_racer.html |archivedate=June 25, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:MK8 Mario Circuit.jpg|thumb|right|Mario driving upside-down using the anti-gravity mechanic introduced in ''[[Mario Kart 8]]''.]]\nIn the ''Mario Kart'' series, players compete in [[Kart racing|go-kart races]], controlling one of a selection of characters, typically from the ''Mario'' franchise. Up to twelve characters can compete in each race; the exact number varies between games.\n\nOne of the features of the series is the use of various [[power-up]] items obtained by driving into item boxes laid out on the course. These power-ups include [[Super Mario (series)#Mushrooms|mushrooms]] to give players a speed boost, [[Koopa Troopa|Koopa]] Shells to be thrown at opponents, [[banana peel]]s and fake item boxes that can be laid on the course as hazards. The type of weapon received from an item box is influenced by the player's current position in the race.<ref name=WM>{{cite web|last=Dan|title=Mario Kart Franchise Retrospective|url=http://www.watchmojo.com/video/title/Mario%20Kart%20Franchise%20Retrospective/|publisher=[[WatchMojo.com]]|accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> For example, players lagging far behind may receive more powerful items, such as Bullet Bills which give the player a bigger speed boost depending on the place of the player, while the leader may only receive small defensive items, such as shells or bananas. Called [[Dynamic game difficulty balancing|rubber banding]], this gameplay mechanism allows other players or computers a realistic chance to catch up to the leading player. They can also perform driving techniques during the race such as rocket starts, [[slipstream]]ing, and mini-turbos.\n\nAs the series has progressed, each new installment has introduced new gameplay elements, such as new circuits, items, modes, and playable characters.<ref name=WM/> These changes include:\n\n* ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' introduces 4-player racing, slipstreaming<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mariowiki.com/Slipstreaming|title=Slipstreaming|website=Super Mario Wiki|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> and [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=WM/> This game also introduced [[Wario]] and [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] as playable characters, as well as seven new items: the Fake Item Box, Triple Red Shell, Triple Green Shell, Triple Mushroom, Banana Bunch, Golden Mushroom, and the infamous [[blue shell]]. In addition to the three Grand Prix engine classes, Mirror mode is introduced (tracks are flipped laterally) in 100cc.\n* ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' introduces the ability to unlock all of the ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' tracks, as both games use the same [[mode 7]] principle.\n* ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' features [[co-operative]] [[LAN]] play and two-player karts.<ref name=WM/> It also introduces eleven new playable characters ([[Princess Daisy]], [[Birdo]], Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Paratroopa, [[Diddy Kong]], [[Bowser Jr.]], [[Waluigi]], [[Toadette]], [[List of Mario franchise characters#Petey Piranha|Petey Piranha]], and [[King Boo]]). The game also features special items that are specific to each character, a feature that was previously accessible only to computer-controlled drivers in the original game and re-introduced in ''Mario Kart Tour''. Finally, this game introduced unlockable characters and karts to the series. Mirror mode is bumped up to 150cc.\n* ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' features [[dual-screen]] play and introduces [[online multiplayer]] (via [[Wi-Fi]]) & retro battle arenas. Shy Guy (exclusive to [[DS Download Play]]), Dry Bones, and [[R.O.B.]] are introduced as playable characters. ''DS'' was also the first ''Mario Kart'' game to feature retro tracks from all previous titles of the series, as well as the first entry in the series to feature mission mode. It also introduces two new items: the Blooper, which temporarily obscures the screens of players in higher places with ink and Bullet Bill, which is given to players in lower places and grants a larger speed boost depending on the position from first place.\n* ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' introduces motion controls, performing tricks, 12-player racing, and [[motorbikes]].<ref name=\"Mario Kart Wii Details\">{{cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/news/mario-kart-wii-detailed | title=Mario Kart Wii Detailed | publisher=1up.com | date=February 6, 2008 | accessdate=May 21, 2013 | author=Sato, Yoshi | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192825/http://www.1up.com/news/mario-kart-wii-detailed | archivedate=October 29, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Six new playable characters were introduced: Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina]], Funky Kong, Dry Bowser, and two outfits for [[Mii]] characters.

It is also the first ''Mario Kart'' game after ''Mario Kart: Double Dash'' not to feature Waluigi as a playable character.

''Mario Kart 8'' introduces the [[Koopalings]], Baby Rosalina, Pink Gold Peach, Tanooki Mario, Cat Peach, Villager and [[Isabelle (Animal Crossing)|Isabelle]] from ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', and [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] from ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' as new playable characters.<ref name=\"MK8 DLC\" /> The Nintendo Switch version, ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'', also adds the Inkling Girl and Inkling Boy from ''[[Splatoon]]'' as playable characters for the first time in the series, as well as a new battle mode, \"Renegade Roundup\", which plays similarly to a game of [[Tag (game)|tag]].\n*''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'' introduces [[Pauline (Mario)|Pauline]] to the series. Alternate outfits for certain characters are also available as rare items. This is the first ''Mario Kart'' game to be released for a non-Nintendo device and introduces [[Gacha game|gacha]] and [[loot box]] mechanics, as well as continuously-renewing character outfits and karts. Character-specific items and increased item probabilities have been re-added. The Mega Mushroom also makes its return after an eleven-year absence. The game also added Frenzy Mode, which happens when the character receives three of the same item during the race.\n===Characters===\n{{Main|Characters in the Mario Kart series}}\n''Mario Kart'' mainly features [[List of Mario franchise characters|characters from the ''Mario'' franchise]]. The ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP]]'' series features [[Bandai Namco]] characters such as [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mario Kart Arcade GP |url=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/triforce/mario_kart_arcade_gp |website=Nintendo Life |accessdate=April 5, 2019|date=December 2011 }}</ref> The [[Downloadable content|DLC]] for ''[[Mario Kart 8]]'' added [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] from ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and Villager and [[Isabelle (Animal Crossing)|Isabelle]] from ''[[Animal Crossing]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Matulef |first1=Jeffrey |title=Mario Kart 8 getting Zelda and Animal Crossing DLC |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-08-26-mario-kart-8-is-getting-zelda-and-animal-crossing-dlc |website=Eurogamer |accessdate=April 5, 2019 |date=August 27, 2014}}</ref> ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' features 42 characters, including the Inklings from ''[[Splatoon]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bashore |first1=Nicholas |title=Here's Every New Character in 'Mario Kart 8 Deluxe' |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/30945-mario-kart-8-deluxe-all-new-characters-gold-mario-unlock |website=Inverse |accessdate=April 5, 2019 |language=en |date=April 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Courses===\nMany course themes recur throughout the series. Most are based on existing areas in the ''Mario'' franchise ([[Mushroom Kingdom#Bowser's Castle|Bowser's Castle]] being among the most prominent), but there are a number of courses that have not appeared elsewhere, yet still belong in the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], such as Rainbow Road, which usually takes place above a city or in space.<ref name=WM/> Each game in the series (following the original game) includes at least 16 original courses and up to 6 original battle arenas.<ref name=WM/> Each game's tracks are divided into four \"cups\", or groups in which the player has to have the highest overall placing to win and they are the Mushroom Cup, the Flower Cup, the Star Cup, and the Special Cup. Most courses can be done in three laps, except in the original game where all circuits required five laps to finish, seven in ''Mario Kart: Double Dash!!'' when racing on Baby Park, and ''Mario Kart Tour'' with only two. The first game to feature courses from previous games was ''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'', which contained all of the tracks from the original Super NES game. Starting with ''Mario Kart DS'', each entry in the series has featured 16 \"nitro\" (brand new courses introduced for said game) and 16 \"retro\" tracks (reappearing courses from previous ''Mario Kart'' games), spread across four cups each with four races. The four Retro Grand Prix cups are the Shell Cup, the Banana Cup, the Leaf Cup, and the Lightning Cup. In ''Mario Kart 8'', 16 additional tracks are available across two [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] packages, eight for each package downloaded, including seven retro courses, four original courses, and five courses based on other Nintendo franchises, including ''[[Excitebike]]'', ''[[F-Zero]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' divided into four additional cups; the Egg Cup, the [[Triforce]] Cup, the Crossing Cup, and the Bell Cup.<ref name=\"MK8 DLC\">{{cite web|last=Farokhmanesh|first=Megan|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/26/6071823/mario-kart-8-link-animal-crossing-dlc|title=Link, F-Zero and Animal Crossing are coming to Mario Kart 8 as DLC|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 26, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2014}}</ref> ''Mario Kart Tour'' introduced courses from around the world including [[Paris]], [[Tokyo]], [[London]], [[Vancouver]], and [[New York City]].\n\n===Modes of play===\nEach installment features a variety of different modes. The following four modes recur most often in the series:\n* '''Grand Prix''' \u2013 Players compete in various \"cups,\" of four courses each (five in ''Super Mario Kart'') with [[difficulty levels]] based on the size of the engine, larger engines meaning faster speeds. Before ''Mario Kart 8'' there were four difficulties: 50[[Cubic centimeter|cc]], 100cc, 150cc, and 150cc Mirror (courses that see their circuits flipped horizontally, originally 100cc Mirror in ''Mario Kart 64''). ''Mario Kart 8'' added a fifth difficulty level: 200cc. Players earn points according to their finishing position in each race and the placement order gets carried over as the starting lineup for the next race. At the end of the cup, the top three players with the most points overall will receive a [[trophy]] in bronze, silver, and gold.\n* '''[[Time trial|Time Trials]]''' \u2013 The player races alone in order to finish any course in the fastest time possible. The best time is then saved as a [[Ghost (video gaming)|ghost]], which the player can race against in later trials. Since ''Mario Kart: Double Dash'', a new function called Staff Ghosts is introduced, Staff Ghosts are members of the Nintendo development team that set staff times for players to try and beat. Upon success, players will unlock Expert Staff Ghosts, which only appeared in ''Mario Kart Wii'' and ''Mario Kart 7'', which unlock characters, vehicles, or stamps once beaten, in addition to viewing ghost data.\n* '''VS Race''' \u2013 Multiple human players race against each other on any course with customized rules such as team racing and item frequency. The mode also includes [[single-player]] VS races and CPU controlled players to compete in VS races as well since ''Mario Kart DS'' (except for ''Mario Kart 7''). ''Super Circuit'', however, features a Quick Run mode, which shares similarities with VS mode.\n* '''Battle''' \u2013 Multiple human players use in-game offensive items (shells, etc.) to battle each other in a closed arena. Each player starts with three [[balloons]] and loses a balloon with every hit sustained; the last player possessing at least one balloon wins. Different battle types were added as the series progressed, as well as single-player battles with CPU controlled players. Starting with ''Mario Kart Wii'', there is a [[Time limit (video gaming)|time limit]] for each battle. For ''Mario Kart 8'', the battles take place on race courses. ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' reintroduces dedicated arenas.\n*'''Online Multiplayer''' \u2013 Players are able to compete in races and battles through online services, such as [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], [[Nintendo Network]], and [[Nintendo Switch Online]]. Players can also share Time Trial ghosts, and participate in [[tournament]]s. In races and battles, players are matched by VR (VS Rating) and BR (Battle Rating) respectively, which is a number between 0 and 99,999 (only 9,999 in ''Mario Kart Wii''). Players gain or lose points based on their performance in a race or battle. The game attempts to match players with a similar rating.\n\n==List of ''Mario Kart'' games==\n{{VG timeline\n|range1 = 1992-\n|range1_color = #6cbe45 #218800\n| 1992 = ''[[Super Mario Kart]]''\n| 1995 = ''[[VB Mario Kart]]'' (Cancelled)\n| 1996 = ''[[Mario Kart 64]]''\n| 2001 = ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]''\n| 2003 = ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]''\n| 2005a = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP]]''\n| 2005b = ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' \n| 2007 = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP 2]]''\n| 2008 = ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]''\n| 2011 = ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''\n| 2013 = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP DX]]''\n| 2014 = ''[[Mario Kart 8]]''\n| 2017a = ''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]''\n| 2017b = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP VR]]''\n| 2019 = ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]''\n}}\n\n===Console games=== <!-- includes home and handheld; shortened for brevity -->\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 40em; text-align: center\"\n! rowspan = \"2\" | Year !! rowspan=\"2\" | Game !! rowspan=\"2\" | Platform !! colspan=\"5\" |[[Virtual Console]]/<br />[[Nintendo Switch Online]] re-release\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Wii !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Wii U !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | 3DS !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | New 3DS !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Switch\n|-\n| 1992 || ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' || [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}}\n|-\n| 1996 ||''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' || [[Nintendo 64|N64]] || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2001 || ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' || [[Game Boy Advance|GBA]] || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Partial|<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\"/>}} || {{Partial|<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\"/>}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2003 || ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' || [[GameCube|GCN]] || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2005 || ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' || [[Nintendo DS|DS]] || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2008 || ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' || [[Wii]] || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2011 || ''[[Mario Kart 7]]'' || [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]] || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2014 ||''[[Mario Kart 8]]'' || [[Wii U]]|| {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2017 ||''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]'' || [[Nintendo Switch|Switch]] || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}}\n|}\n{{legend|#D2FFD2|text=[[File:Green check.svg|13px]]|Available on Virtual Console or Nintendo Switch Online}}\n{{legend|#FFB|text={{Dagger}}|Available by using backwards compatibility}}\n{{legend|#DDFBFF|text={{Double-dagger}}|Available natively on the console}}\n{{Reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\">''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'' can be played on Nintendo 3DS systems that feature the Nintendo 3DS Ambassadors program.</ref>\n}}\n\n===Arcade games===\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP|Mario Kart Arcade GP]]'' (2005, [[Arcade game|Arcade]]) (Co-developed by [[Namco]])\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP 2|Mario Kart Arcade GP 2]]'' (2007, Arcade) (Co-developed by [[Namco Bandai Games]])\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP DX|Mario Kart Arcade GP DX]]'' (2013, Arcade) (Co-developed by Namco Bandai Games)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arcadeheroes.com/2013/02/05/namco-formally-announces-mario-kart-arcade-grand-prix-dx/|title=Namco Formally Announces Mario Kart Arcade Grand Prix DX - Arcade Heroes|date=February 5, 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP VR|Mario Kart Arcade GP VR]]'' (2017, Arcade) (by [[Bandai Namco Studios]])<ref name=VRZone>{{cite web|url=http://vrzone-pic.com/en/activity/mariocart.html|title=MARIO KART ARCADE GP VR - VR ZONE SHINJUKU|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoeverything.com/mario-kart-arcade-gp-vr-announced-for-bandai-namcos-virtual-reality-arcade-played-with-htc-vive/|title=Mario Kart Arcade GP VR announced for Bandai Namco's virtual reality arcade, played with HTC Vive - Nintendo Everything|date=June 13, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Mobile games===\n* ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'' (2019)\n\n===Canceled games===\n* ''VB Mario Kart'' was scheduled for the [[Virtual Boy]] in 1995.

In 743, the brothers placed [[Childeric III]] on the throne to curb separatism in the periphery. He was the last Merovingian king. Carloman resigned office in 746, preferring to enter the church as a monk. Pepin brought the question of the kingship before [[Pope Zachary]], asking whether it was logical for a king to have no royal power. The pope handed down his decision in 749, decreeing that it was better for Pepin to be called king, as he had the powers of high office as Mayor, so as not to confuse the hierarchy. He, therefore, ordered him to become the ''true king''.<ref name=\"France/Pippin\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/40284/Pippin-III |title=France :: Pippin III \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=24 April 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 750, Pepin was elected by an assembly of the Franks, anointed by the archbishop, and then raised to the office of king. The Pope branded Childeric III as \"the false king\" and ordered him into a monastery. The Merovingian dynasty was thereby replaced by the [[Carolingian]] dynasty, named after Charles Martel. In 753, [[Pope Stephen II]] fled from Italy to Francia, appealing to Pepin for assistance for the rights of St. Peter. He was supported in this appeal by Carloman, Charles' brother<!---should this be Pepin's brother?- Apparently not; Pepin's brother only left the monastery (Monte Cassino), to plead that Pepin NOT provide aid to Stephen II, and was then imprisoned. Carloman, son of Pepin and brother to Charles, supported Stephen II, and was named along with his father and brother as kings.-->. In return, the pope could provide only legitimacy. He did this by again anointing and confirming Pepin, this time adding his young sons Carolus (Charlemagne) and Carloman to the royal patrimony. They thereby became heirs to the realm that already covered most of western Europe. In 754, Pepin accepted the Pope's invitation to visit Italy on behalf of St. Peter's rights, dealing successfully with the [[Lombards]].<ref name=\"France/Pippin\" /><ref>The background relies heavily on {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745\u2013755}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Carolingians, the Frankish kingdom spread to encompass an area including most of Western Europe; the east-west division of the kingdom formed the basis for modern [[History of France|France]] and [[History of Germany|Germany]].

The middle kingdom had broken up by 890 and partly absorbed into the Western kingdom (later France) and the Eastern kingdom (Germany) and the rest developing into smaller \"buffer\" nations that exist between France and Germany to this day, namely the [[Benelux]] and [[Switzerland]]. \n==Rise to power==\n\n===Early life===\n\n====Date of birth====\nThe most likely date of Charlemagne's birth is reconstructed from several sources.

Plan of This Work}}}}\n\n===Ambiguous high office===\n{{further|Mayor of the Palace}}\n\nThe most powerful officers of the Frankish people, the Mayor of the Palace (''Maior Domus'') and one or more kings (''rex'', ''reges''), were appointed by the election of the people. Elections were not periodic, but were held as required to elect officers ''ad quos summa imperii pertinebat'', \"to whom the highest matters of state pertained\". Evidently, interim decisions could be made by the Pope, which ultimately needed to be ratified using an assembly of the people that met annually.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=1. The Merovingian Family}}\n\nBefore he was elected king in 751, Pepin was initially a mayor, a high office he held \"as though hereditary\" (''velut hereditario fungebatur''). Einhard explains that \"the honour\" was usually \"given by the people\" to the distinguished, but Pepin the Great and his brother Carloman the Wise received it as though hereditary, as had their father, [[Charles Martel]]. There was, however, a certain ambiguity about quasi-inheritance. The office was treated as joint property: one Mayorship held by two brothers jointly.<ref>The ''Annales'' uses maiores domus, a plural followed by a singular: one house, two chief officers. {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 742}}</ref> Each, however, had his own geographic jurisdiction. When Carloman decided to resign, becoming ultimately a Benedictine at [[Monte Cassino]],{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745, 746}} the question of the disposition of his quasi-share was settled by the pope. He converted the mayorship into a kingship and awarded the joint property to Pepin, who gained the right to pass it on by inheritance.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}}\n\nThis decision was not accepted by all family members. Carloman had consented to the temporary tenancy of his own share, which he intended to pass on to his son, Drogo, when the inheritance should be settled at someone's death. By the Pope's decision, in which Pepin had a hand, Drogo was to be disqualified as an heir in favour of his cousin Charles. He took up arms in opposition to the decision and was joined by [[Grifo]], a half-brother of Pepin and Carloman, who had been given a share by Charles Martel, but was stripped of it and held under loose arrest by his half-brothers after an attempt to seize their shares by military action. Grifo perished in combat in the Battle of [[Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne]] while Drogo was hunted down and taken into custody.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nOn the death of Pepin, 24 September 768, the kingship passed jointly to his sons, \"with divine assent\" (''divino nutu'').{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=3. Charlemagne's Accession}} According to the ''Life'', Pepin died in Paris. The Franks \"in general assembly\" (''generali conventu'') gave them both the rank of a king (''reges'') but \"partitioned the whole body of the kingdom equally\" (''totum regni corpus ex aequo partirentur''). The ''annals''{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 768}} tell a slightly different version, with the king dying at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Denis]], near Paris. The two \"lords\" (''domni'') were \"elevated to kingship\" (''elevati sunt in regnum''), Charles on 9 October in [[Noyon]], Carloman on an unspecified date in [[Soissons]]. If born in 742, Charles was 26 years old, but he had been campaigning at his father's right hand for several years, which may help to account for his military skill. [[Carloman I|Carloman]] was 17.\n\nThe language, in either case, suggests that there were not two inheritances, which would have created distinct kings ruling over distinct kingdoms, but a single joint inheritance and a joint kingship tenanted by two equal kings, Charles and his brother Carloman. As before, distinct jurisdictions were awarded. Charles received Pepin's original share as Mayor: the outer parts of the kingdom bordering on the sea, namely [[Neustria]], western [[Aquitaine]], and the northern parts of [[Austrasia]]; while Carloman was awarded his uncle's former share, the inner parts: southern Austrasia, [[Septimania]], eastern Aquitaine, [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Provence, and [[Swabia]], lands bordering [[Italy]]. The question of whether these jurisdictions were joint shares reverting to the other brother if one brother died or were inherited property passed on to the descendants of the brother who died was never definitely settled. It came up repeatedly over the succeeding decades until the grandsons of Charlemagne created distinct sovereign kingdoms.\n\n===Aquitainian rebellion===\n====Formation of a new Aquitaine====\n{{main|Aquitaine}}\n\n[[Aquitaine]] under Rome had been in southern [[Gaul]], Romanised and speaking a [[Romance language]]. Similarly, [[Hispania]] had been populated by peoples who spoke various languages, including [[Celtic language|Celtic]], but the area was now populated primarily by Romance language speakers. Between Aquitaine and Hispania were the [[Basques|Euskaldunak]], Latinised to [[Vascones]], or [[Basques]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=32}} living in Basque country, Vasconia, which extended, according to the distributions of place names attributable to the Basques, most densely in the western [[Pyrenees]] but also as far south as the upper [[Ebro River]] in Spain and as far north as the [[Garonne River]] in France.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=105}} The French name, [[Gascony]], derives from [[Vasconia]]. The Romans were never able to entirely subject Vasconia. The parts they did, in which they placed the region's first cities, were sources of legions in the Roman army valued for their fighting abilities. The border with Aquitaine was [[Toulouse]].\n\nAt about 660, the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] united with the [[Duke of Aquitaine|Duchy of Aquitaine]] to form a single realm under [[Felix of Aquitaine]], governing from Toulouse. This was a joint kingship with a Basque Duke, [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus I]]. ''Lupus'' is the Latin translation of Basque Otsoa, \"wolf\".{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|pp=36\u201337}} At Felix's death in 670 the joint property of the kingship reverted entirely to Lupus. As the Basques had no law of joint inheritance but practised [[primogeniture]], [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus]] in effect founded a hereditary dynasty of Basque rulers of an expanded Aquitaine.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=100}}\n\n====Acquisition of Aquitaine by the Carolingians====\n{{further|Umayyad conquest of Hispania}}\n[[File:Al-Andalus732.jpg|thumb|Moorish Hispania in 732]]\n\nThe Latin chronicles of the end of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] omit many details, such as identification of characters, filling in the gaps and reconciliation of numerous contradictions.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2004|pp=130\u201331}}, \"The sequence of events...has not been assisted by the tendency of the historians to take all the information...from all the available sources and combine it to produce a single synthetic account...As a rule of thumb, reliability, and also brevity of narrative, are usually in direct proportion to chronological proximity.\"</ref> Muslim sources, however, present a more coherent view, such as in the ''Ta'rikh iftitah al-Andalus'' (\"History of the Conquest of al-Andalus\") by [[Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya]] (\"the son of the Gothic woman\", referring to the granddaughter of [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania, who married a Moor). Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya, who had another, much longer name, must have been relying to some degree on family oral tradition.\n\nAccording to Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya{{sfn|James|2009|p=49}} [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania died before his three sons, Almund, Romulo, and Ardabast reached maturity. Their mother was [[queen regent]] at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], but [[Roderic]], army chief of staff, staged a rebellion, capturing [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He chose to impose a joint rule over distinct jurisdictions on the true heirs. Evidence of a division of some sort can be found in the distribution of coins imprinted with the name of each king and in the king lists.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=131\u201332}} Wittiza was succeeded by Roderic, who reigned for seven and a half years, followed by Achila (Aquila), who reigned three and a half years. If the reigns of both terminated with the incursion of the [[Saracens]], then Roderic appears to have reigned a few years before the majority of Achila. The latter's kingdom is securely placed to the northeast, while Roderic seems to have taken the rest, notably modern [[Portugal]].\n\nThe Saracens crossed the mountains to claim Ardo's [[Septimania]], only to encounter the Basque dynasty of Aquitaine, always the allies of the Goths. [[Odo the Great]] of [[Aquitaine]] was at first victorious at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721.{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|p=40}} Saracen troops gradually massed in Septimania and in 732 an army under Emir [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] advanced into Vasconia, and Odo was defeated at the [[Battle of the River Garonne]]. They took [[Bordeaux]] and were advancing towards [[Tours]] when Odo, powerless to stop them, appealed to his arch-enemy, [[Charles Martel]], mayor of the Franks. In one of the first of the lightning marches for which the Carolingian kings became famous, Charles and his army appeared in the path of the Saracens between Tours and [[Poitiers]], and in the [[Battle of Tours]] decisively defeated and killed al-Ghafiqi. The Moors returned twice more, each time suffering defeat at Charles' hands\u2014at the River Berre near Narbonne in 737{{sfn|Einhard|2007|p=24}} and in the [[Dauphin\u00e9]] in 740.<ref name=\"Lewis2009\">{{cite book|first=David Levering |last=Lewis|title=God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570\u20131215|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=NwA7mQEACAAJ|page=177}}|date=2009|publisher=W.W.

However, Odo had ambiguously left the kingdom jointly to his two sons, Hunald and Hatto. The latter, loyal to Francia, now went to war with his brother over full possession. Victorious, Hunald blinded and imprisoned his brother, only to be so stricken by conscience that he resigned and entered the church as a monk to do penance. The story is told in [[Annales Mettenses priores]].<ref name=\"Freeman1904\">{{cite book|first=Edward Augustus |last=Freeman|title=Western Europe in the Eighth Century & Onward: An Aftermath|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5HCIvgAACAAJ|page=74}}|year=1904|publisher=Macmillan and Company, limited| page=74}}</ref> His son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] took an early inheritance, becoming duke of Aquitaine and ratified the alliance with Lombardy. Waifer decided to honour it, repeating his father's decision, which he justified by arguing that any agreements with Charles Martel became invalid on Martel's death. Since [[Aquitaine]] was now Pepin's inheritance because of the earlier assistance that was given by Charles Martel, according to some the latter and his son, the young Charles, hunted down Waifer, who could only conduct a guerrilla war, and executed him.{{sfn|Russell|1930|p=88}}\n\nAmong the contingents of the Frankish army were [[Bavaria]]ns under [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria]], an [[Agilofing]], the hereditary Bavarian ducal family. [[Grifo]] had installed himself as Duke of Bavaria, but Pepin replaced him with a member of the ducal family yet a child, Tassilo, whose protector he had become after the death of his father. The loyalty of the Agilolfings was perpetually in question, but Pepin exacted numerous oaths of loyalty from Tassilo. However, the latter had married [[Liutperga]], a daughter of [[Desiderius]], king of [[Lombardy]]. At a critical point in the campaign, Tassilo left the field with all his Bavarians. Out of reach of Pepin, he repudiated all loyalty to Francia.{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|pp=118\u201325}} Pepin had no chance to respond as he grew ill and died within a few weeks after Waifer's execution.\n\nThe first event of the brothers' reign was the uprising of the Aquitainians and [[Gascony|Gascons]], in 769, in that territory split between the two kings. One year earlier, Pepin had finally defeated [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], after waging a destructive, ten-year war against Aquitaine. Now, [[Hunald II]] led the Aquitainians as far north as [[Angoul\u00eame]]. Charles met Carloman, but Carloman refused to participate and returned to Burgundy. Charles went to war, leading an army to [[Bordeaux]], where he set up a fort at Fronsac. Hunald was forced to flee to the court of Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupus&nbsp;II of Gascony]]. Lupus, fearing Charles, turned Hunald over in exchange for peace, and Hunald was put in a monastery. Gascon lords also surrendered, and Aquitaine and [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]] were finally fully subdued by the Franks.\n\n===Marriage to Desiderata===\nThe brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother Bertrada, but in 770 Charles signed a treaty with Duke [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] and married a Lombard Princess (commonly known today as [[Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne|Desiderata]]), the daughter of King [[Desiderius]], to surround Carloman with his own allies. Though [[Pope Stephen III]] first opposed the marriage with the Lombard princess, he found little to fear from a Frankish-Lombard alliance.\n\nLess than a year after his marriage, Charlemagne repudiated Desiderata and married a 13-year-old Swabian named [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]]. The repudiated Desiderata returned to her father's court at [[Pavia]]. Her father's wrath was now aroused, and he would have gladly allied with Carloman to defeat Charles. Before any open hostilities could be declared, however, Carloman died on 5 December 771, apparently of natural causes. Carloman's widow [[Gerberge, wife of Carloman|Gerberga]] fled to Desiderius' court with her sons for protection.\n\n== Wives, concubines, and children ==\nCharlemagne had eighteen children with eight of his ten known wives or concubines.<ref>Durant, Will.

In addition, he had a grandson ([[Bernard of Italy]], the only son of his third son, [[Pepin of Italy]]), who was illegitimate but included in the line of inheritance. Among his descendants are several royal dynasties, including the [[Habsburg]], [[Capetian]] and [[Plantagenet]] dynasties. By consequence, most if not all established European noble families ever since can genealogically trace their background to Charlemagne.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Start date\n! Wives and their children\n! Concubines and their children\n|-\n| c.768\n| His first relationship was with [[Himiltrude]]. The nature of this relationship is variously described as [[concubinage]], a legal marriage, or a [[Friedelehe]].<ref>Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] (Vita Karoli Magni, ch. 20) calls her a \"concubine\" and [[Paulus Diaconus]] speaks of Pippin's birth \"before legal marriage\", whereas a letter by [[Pope Stephen III]] refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and [[Gerberga, wife of Carloman I|Gerberga]]), and advises them not to dismiss their wives. Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as [[Pierre Rich\u00e9]] (''The Carolingians'', p.86.), follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine. Others, for example Dieter H\u00e4gemann (''Karl der Gro\u00dfe. Herrscher des Abendlands'', p. 82f.), consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was \"something more than concubinage, less than marriage\" and describe it as a [[Friedelehe]], a form of marriage unrecognised by the Church and easily dissolvable. Russell Chamberlin (''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. 61.), for instance, compared it with the English system of common-law marriage. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.</ref> (Charlemagne put her aside when he married Desiderata.)

The younger of the two, [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], became [[King of Aquitaine]]. Charlemagne ordered Pepin and Louis to be raised in the customs of their kingdoms, and he gave their regents some control of their subkingdoms, but kept the real power, though he intended his sons to inherit their realms. He did not tolerate insubordination in his sons: in 792, he banished Pepin the Hunchback to [[Pr\u00fcm Abbey]] because the young man had joined a rebellion against him.\n\nCharles was determined to have his children educated, including his daughters, as his parents had instilled the importance of learning in him at an early age.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hbnY8GTet_kC}}|title=Charlemagne |last=Gelfand|first=Dale Evva|date=2003|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438117850|language=en}}</ref> His children were also taught skills in accord with their aristocratic status, which included training in riding and weaponry for his sons, and embroidery, spinning and weaving for his daughters.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bQlJP9O9hKkC}}|title=Daily Life in the Age of Charlemagne|last=Butt|first=John J.|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313316685|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe sons fought many wars on behalf of their father. [[Charles the Younger|Charles]] was mostly preoccupied with the Bretons, whose border he shared and who insurrected on at least two occasions and were easily put down. He also fought the Saxons on multiple occasions. In 805 and 806, he was sent into the B\u00f6hmerwald (modern [[Bohemia]]) to deal with the Slavs living there (Bohemian tribes, ancestors of the modern [[Czech people|Czechs]]). He subjected them to Frankish authority and devastated the valley of the Elbe, forcing tribute from them. Pippin had to hold the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] and Beneventan borders and fought the [[Slavs]] to his north. He was uniquely poised to fight the [[Byzantine Empire]] when that conflict arose after Charlemagne's imperial coronation and a [[Venetia (region)|Venetian]] rebellion. Finally, Louis was in charge of the [[Spanish March]] and fought the Duke of Benevento in southern Italy on at least one occasion. He took [[Barcelona]] in a great siege in 797.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne et Louis le Pieux.jpg|thumb|Charlemagne instructing his son [[Louis the Pious]]]]\n\nCharlemagne kept his daughters at home with him and refused to allow them to contract [[marriage#Marriage and religion|sacramental marriages]] (though he originally condoned an engagement between his eldest daughter Rotrude and [[Constantine VI]] of Byzantium, this engagement was annulled when Rotrude was 11).<ref>Runciman, Steven. \"The Empress Irene the Athenian.\" Medieval Women.

However, he tolerated their extramarital relationships, even rewarding their common-law husbands and treasuring the illegitimate grandchildren they produced for him. He also, apparently, refused to believe stories of their wild behaviour. After his death the surviving daughters were banished from the court by their brother, the pious Louis, to take up residence in the convents they had been bequeathed by their father. At least one of them, Bertha, had a recognised relationship, if not a marriage, with [[Angilbert]], a member of Charlemagne's court circle.{{sfn|Becher|2005|p=122}}{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|p=91}}\n\n==Italian campaigns==\n\n===Conquest of the Lombard kingdom===\n[[File:Charlemagne and Pope Adrian I.jpg|thumb|The Frankish king Charlemagne was a devout Catholic and maintained a close relationship with the papacy throughout his life.

Instead, Desiderius took over certain papal cities and invaded the [[Pentapolis]], heading for Rome. Adrian sent ambassadors to Charlemagne in autumn requesting he enforce the policies of his father, Pepin. Desiderius sent his own ambassadors denying the pope's charges. The ambassadors met at [[Thionville]], and Charlemagne upheld the pope's side. Charlemagne demanded what the pope had requested, but Desiderius swore never to comply.

There he confirmed [[Donation of Pepin|his father's grants of land]],<ref name=\"Campaigns\" /> with some later chronicles falsely claiming that he also expanded them, granting [[Tuscany]], [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], Venice and [[Corsica]]. The pope granted him the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]''. He then returned to Pavia, where the Lombards were on the verge of surrendering. In return for their lives, the Lombards surrendered and opened the gates in early summer. Desiderius was sent to the [[abbey]] of [[Corbie]], and his son Adelchis died in [[Constantinople]], a patrician. Charles, unusually, had himself crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] and made the magnates of Lombardy pay homage to him at Pavia. Only Duke [[Arechis II of Benevento]] refused to submit and proclaimed independence. Charlemagne was then master of Italy as king of the Lombards. He left Italy with a garrison in Pavia and a few Frankish counts in place the same year.\n\nInstability continued in Italy. In 776, Dukes [[Hrodgaud of Friuli]] and [[Hildeprand of Spoleto]] rebelled. Charlemagne rushed back from [[Saxony]] and defeated the Duke of Friuli in battle; the Duke was slain.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}} The Duke of Spoleto signed a treaty. Their co-conspirator, Arechis, was not subdued, and Adelchis, their candidate in [[Byzantium]], never left that city.

Charlemagne's siege of [[Salerno]] forced Arechis into submission. However, after Arechis II's death in 787, his son [[Grimoald III of Benevento|Grimoald III]] proclaimed the Duchy of Benevento newly independent. Grimoald was attacked many times by Charles' or his sons' armies, without achieving a definitive victory.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1889|pp=85\u201386}} Charlemagne lost interest and never again returned to [[Southern Italy]] where Grimoald was able to keep the Duchy free from Frankish [[suzerainty]].\n\n==Carolingian expansion to the south==\n{{See also|Abbasid\u2013Carolingian alliance}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Vasconia and the Pyrenees===\nThe destructive war led by Pepin in Aquitaine, although brought to a satisfactory conclusion for the Franks, proved the Frankish power structure south of the [[Loire]] was feeble and unreliable. After the defeat and death of [[Waiofar]] in 768, while Aquitaine submitted again to the Carolingian dynasty, a new rebellion broke out in 769 led by Hunald II, a possible son of Waifer. He took refuge with the ally Duke [[Lupus II of Gascony]], but probably out of fear of Charlemagne's reprisal, Lupus handed him over to the new King of the Franks to whom he pledged loyalty, which seemed to confirm the peace in [[Duchy of Vasconia|the Basque area]] south of the [[Garonne]].<ref name=Lewis>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Archibald Ross |year=1965 |title=The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society 718\u20131050 |publisher=University of Texas Press |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nWary of new Basque uprisings, Charlemagne seems to have tried to contain Duke Lupus's power by appointing [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin]] as the Count of Bordeaux (778) and other counts of Frankish background in bordering areas ([[History of Toulouse#768\u2013877: Carolingian Franks and the Kingdom of Aquitaine|Toulouse]], [[County of F\u00e9zensac]]). The [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basque]] Duke, in turn, seems to have contributed decisively or schemed the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (referred to as \"Basque treachery\"). The defeat of Charlemagne's army in Roncevaux (778) confirmed his determination to rule directly by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine (ruled by [[Louis the Pious]]) based on a power base of Frankish officials, distributing lands among colonisers and allocating lands to the Church, which he took as an ally. A Christianisation programme was put in place across the high [[Pyrenees]] (778).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\n[[File:771 CE, Europe.svg|thumb|Europe in 771]]\nThe new political arrangement for Vasconia did not sit well with local lords. As of 788 [[Adalric of Gascony|Adalric]] was fighting and capturing [[Torson of Toulouse|Chorson]], Carolingian Count of Toulouse. He was eventually released, but Charlemagne, enraged at the compromise, decided to depose him and appointed his trustee [[William of Gellone]]. William, in turn, fought the Basques and defeated them after banishing Adalric (790).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\nFrom 781 ([[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagor\u00e7a]]) to 806 ([[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]] under Frankish influence), taking the County of Toulouse for a power base, Charlemagne asserted Frankish authority over the Pyrenees by subduing the south-western marches of Toulouse (790) and establishing vassal counties on the southern Pyrenees that were to make up the [[Marca Hispanica]].{{sfn|Lewis|1965|p=40}} As of 794, a Frankish vassal, the Basque lord Belasko (''al-Galashki'', 'the Gaul') ruled [[\u00c1lava]], but Pamplona remained under Cordovan and local control up to 806. Belasko and the counties in the Marca Hisp\u00e1nica provided the necessary base to attack the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] (an expedition led by [[William of Gellone|William Count of Toulouse]] and Louis the Pious to capture Barcelona in 801). Events in the Duchy of Vasconia (rebellion in Pamplona, [[Aznar Gal\u00edndez I|count overthrown in Aragon]], Duke Seguin of Bordeaux deposed, uprising of the Basque lords, etc.) were to prove it ephemeral upon Charlemagne's death.\n\n===Roncesvalles campaign===\nAccording to the Muslim historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of [[Paderborn]] had received the representatives of the Muslim rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Huesca]]. Their masters had been cornered in the [[Iberian peninsula]] by [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], the [[Umayyad]] [[emir of C\u00f3rdoba|emir of Cordova]]. These \"Saracen\" ([[Moorish]] and [[Muladi]]) rulers offered their homage to the king of the Franks in return for military support. Seeing an opportunity to extend [[Christendom]] and his own power and believing the Saxons to be a fully conquered nation, Charlemagne agreed to go to Spain.\n\nIn 778, he led the Neustrian army across the Western [[Pyrenees]], while the Austrasians, Lombards, and Burgundians passed over the Eastern Pyrenees. The armies met at Saragossa and Charlemagne received the homage of the Muslim rulers, Sulayman al-Arabi and Kasmin ibn Yusuf, but the city did not fall for him. Indeed, Charlemagne faced the toughest battle of his career. The Muslims forced him to retreat. He decided to go home since he could not trust the [[Basques]], whom he had subdued by conquering [[Pamplona]]. He turned to leave Iberia, but as he was passing through the Pass of [[Roncesvalles]] one of the most famous events of his reign occurred. The Basques attacked and destroyed his rearguard and baggage train. The [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]], though less a battle than a skirmish, left many famous dead, including the [[seneschal]] Eggihard, the count of the palace Anselm, and the [[wikt:warden|warden]] of the [[Breton March]], [[Roland]], inspiring the subsequent creation of the [[Song of Roland]] (''La Chanson de Roland'').\n\n===Contact with the Saracens===\n[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Harun al-Rashid]] receiving a delegation of Charlemagne in [[Baghdad]], by [[Julius K\u00f6ckert]] (1864)]]\n\nThe conquest of Italy brought Charlemagne in contact with the [[Saracen]]s who, at the time, controlled the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Charlemagne's eldest son, [[Pepin the Hunchback]], was much occupied with Saracens in Italy. Charlemagne conquered [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] at an unknown date and in 799 the [[Balearic Islands]]. The islands were often attacked by Saracen pirates, but the counts of [[Genoa]] and Tuscany ([[Boniface I of Tuscany|Boniface]]) controlled them with large fleets until the end of Charlemagne's reign. Charlemagne even had contact with the [[caliph]]al court in [[Baghdad]]. In 797 (or possibly 801), the caliph of Baghdad, [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented Charlemagne with an [[Asian elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] and a [[clock]].<ref name=\"Heck2007\">{{cite book|first=Gene W. |last=Heck|title=When Worlds Collide: Exploring the Ideological and Political Foundations of the Clash of Civilizations|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dtAyMXqaozwC|page=172}}|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-5856-4|pages=172\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Wars with the Moors===\n\nIn [[Hispania]], the struggle against the Moors continued unabated throughout the latter half of his reign. Louis was in charge of the Spanish border. In 785, his men captured Girona permanently and extended Frankish control into the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] littoral for the duration of Charlemagne's reign (the area remained nominally Frankish until the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]] in 1258). The Muslim chiefs in the northeast of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] were constantly rebelling against Cordovan authority, and they often turned to the Franks for help. The Frankish border was slowly extended until 795, when Girona, [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Ausona]] and [[County of Urgell|Urgell]] were united into the new [[Spanish March]], within the old duchy of [[Septimania]].\n\nIn 797, [[Barcelona]], the greatest city of the region, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Cordova and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis of Aquitaine marched the entire army of his kingdom over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. The Franks continued to press forward against the [[emir]]. They took [[Tarragona]] in 809 and [[Tortosa]] in 811. The last conquest brought them to the mouth of the [[Ebro]] and gave them raiding access to [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], prompting the Emir [[al-Hakam I]] to recognise their conquests in 813.\n\n==Eastern campaigns==\n\n===Saxon Wars===\n{{Further|Saxon Wars}}\n[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map showing Charlemagne's additions (in light green) to the Frankish Kingdom]]\n\nCharlemagne was engaged in almost constant warfare throughout his reign,<ref>France, John, \"The Composition and Raising of the Armies of Charlemagne\", in Journal of Medieval Military History, ed. B. Bachrach (2002), pp. 63\u201365</ref> often at the head of his elite ''[[scara]]'' bodyguard squadrons. In the [[Saxon Wars]], spanning thirty years and eighteen battles, he conquered [[Old Saxony|Saxonia]] and proceeded to convert it to Christianity.\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Saxons]] were divided into four subgroups in four regions. Nearest to [[Austrasia]] was [[Westphalia]] and furthest away was [[Eastphalia]]. Between them was [[Engria]] and north of these three, at the base of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, was [[Nordalbingia]].\n\nIn his first campaign, in 773, Charlemagne forced the Engrians to submit and cut down an [[Irminsul]] pillar near [[Paderborn]].<ref>Revised annals of the kingdom of the Franks, ed. and trans. King, Sources, p. 110</ref> The campaign was cut short by his first expedition to Italy. He returned in 775, marching through Westphalia and conquering the Saxon fort at [[Sigiburg]]. He then crossed Engria, where he defeated the Saxons again. Finally, in Eastphalia, he defeated a Saxon force, and its leader [[Hessi]] converted to Christianity. Charlemagne returned through Westphalia, leaving encampments at Sigiburg and [[Eresburg]], which had been important Saxon bastions. He then controlled Saxony with the exception of Nordalbingia, but Saxon resistance had not ended.\n\nFollowing his subjugation of the Dukes of Friuli and Spoleto, Charlemagne returned rapidly to Saxony in 776, where a rebellion had destroyed his fortress at Eresburg. The Saxons were once again defeated, but their main leader, [[Widukind]], escaped to Denmark, his wife's home. Charlemagne built a new camp at [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt]]. In 777, he called a national diet at Paderborn to integrate Saxony fully into the Frankish kingdom. Many Saxons were baptised as Christians.\n\nIn the summer of 779, he again invaded Saxony and reconquered Eastphalia, Engria and Westphalia. At a diet near [[Lippe]], he divided the land into missionary districts and himself assisted in several mass baptisms (780). He then returned to Italy and, for the first time, the Saxons did not immediately revolt. Saxony was peaceful from 780 to 782.\n\n[[File:Ary Scheffer, Charlemagne re\u00e7oit la soumission de Widukind \u00e0 Paderborn, (1840).jpg|thumb|left|Charlemagne receiving the submission of [[Widukind]] at [[Paderborn]] in 785, painted c.&nbsp;1840 by [[Ary Scheffer]]]]\n\nHe returned to Saxony in 782 and instituted a code of law and appointed counts, both Saxon and Frank. The laws were draconian on religious issues; for example, the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'' prescribed death to Saxon pagans who refused to convert to Christianity. This led to renewed conflict. That year, in autumn, Widukind returned and led a new revolt. In response, at [[Verden, Germany|Verden]] in Lower Saxony, Charlemagne is recorded as having ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners by beheading, known as the [[Massacre of Verden]] (\"Verdener Blutgericht\"). The killings triggered three years of renewed bloody warfare. During this war, the [[East Frisia]]ns between the [[Lauwers]] and the [[Weser]] joined the Saxons in revolt and were finally subdued.<ref>Oebele Vries, \"Friesland\", ''Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 2001), pp. 252\u201356.</ref> The war ended with Widukind accepting baptism.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yW-GfElbafQC&pg=PA368|title=Encyclopedia of Barbarian Europe: Society in Transformation|first=Michael|last=Frassetto|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=9781576072639|chapter=Widukind|page=368}}</ref> The Frisians afterwards asked for missionaries to be sent to them and a bishop of their own nation, [[Ludger]], was sent.

The Eastphalians and Nordalbingians joined them in 793, but the insurrection was unpopular and was put down by 794. An Engrian rebellion followed in 796, but the presence of Charlemagne, Christian Saxons and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] quickly crushed it. The last insurrection occurred in 804, more than thirty years after Charlemagne's first campaign against them, but also failed. According to Einhard:\n{{quote|\nThe war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the King; which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.\n}}\n\n===Submission of Bavaria===\n[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Equestrian statue of Charlemagne (Cornacchini)|Equestrian statue of Charlemagne]]'' by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]].]]\n\nBy 774, Charlemagne had invaded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Kingdom of Lombardy]], and he later annexed the Lombardian territories and assumed its crown, placing the [[Papal States]] under Frankish protection.<ref name=\"autogenerated30\">Historical Atlas of Knights and Castles, Cartographica, Dr Ian Barnes, 2007 pp.30&31</ref> The [[Duchy of Spoleto]] south of Rome was acquired in 774, while in the central western parts of Europe, the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was absorbed and the Bavarian policy continued of establishing tributary [[marches]], (borders protected in return for tribute or taxes) among the [[Slavs|Slavic]] Serbs and Czechs.

Charlemagne was preoccupied with other matters until 790 when he marched down the [[Danube]] and ravaged Avar territory to the [[Gy\u0151r]]. A Lombard army under Pippin then marched into the [[Drava]] valley and ravaged [[Pannonia]]. The campaigns ended when the Saxons revolted again in 792.\n\nFor the next two years, Charlemagne was occupied, along with the Slavs, against the Saxons. Pippin and Duke [[Eric of Friuli]] continued, however, to assault the Avars' ring-shaped strongholds. The great Ring of the Avars, their capital fortress, was taken twice. The booty was sent to Charlemagne at his capital, [[Aachen]], and redistributed to his followers and to foreign rulers, including King [[Offa of Mercia]]. Soon the Avar [[tudun]]s had lost the will to fight and travelled to Aachen to become vassals to Charlemagne and to become Christians. Charlemagne accepted their surrender and sent one native chief, baptised Abraham, back to Avaria with the ancient title of [[khagan]]. Abraham kept his people in line, but in 800, the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] under [[Krum|Khan Krum]] attacked the remains of the Avar state.\n\nIn 803, Charlemagne sent a Bavarian army into [[Pannonia]], defeating and bringing an end to the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar confederation]].<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite book|first1=Bernard S. |last1=Bachrach|author2=Clifford J.

The Slavs ultimately submitted, led by their leader Witzin. Charlemagne then accepted the surrender of the [[Veleti]] under Dragovit and demanded many hostages. He also demanded permission to send missionaries into this pagan region unmolested. The army marched to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] before turning around and marching to the Rhine, winning much booty with no harassment. The tributary Slavs became loyal allies. In 795, when the Saxons broke the peace, the Abotrites and Veleti rebelled with their new ruler against the Saxons. Witzin died in battle and Charlemagne avenged him by harrying the Eastphalians on the Elbe. Thrasuco, his successor, led his men to conquest over the Nordalbingians and handed their leaders over to Charlemagne, who honoured him.

Einhard, ''Vita Karoli Magni'',&nbsp;28.</ref> but that debate obscured the more significant question of ''why'' the Pope granted the title and why Charlemagne accepted it.\n\n[[Roger Collins|Collins]] points out \"[t]hat the motivation behind the acceptance of the imperial title was a romantic and antiquarian interest in reviving the Roman empire is highly unlikely.\"{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=147}} For one thing, such romance would not have appealed either to Franks or Roman Catholics at the turn of the ninth century, both of whom viewed the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] heritage of the Roman Empire with distrust. The Franks took pride in having \"fought against and thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans\" and \"from the knowledge gained in baptism, clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of the holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire, by the sword and by wild animals\", as [[Pepin the Short|Pepin&nbsp;III]] described it in a law of 763 or 764.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}}\n\nFurthermore, the new title\u2014carrying with it the risk that the new emperor would \"make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of government\" or \"concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally\"\u2014risked alienating the Frankish leadership.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=149}}\n\nFor both the Pope and Charlemagne, the Roman Empire remained a significant power in European politics at this time. The [[Byzantine Empire]], based in [[Constantinople]], continued to hold a substantial portion of Italy, with borders not far south of Rome. Charles' sitting in judgment of the Pope could be seen as usurping the prerogatives of the Emperor in Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|By whom, however, could he [the Pope] be tried? Who, in other words, was qualified to pass judgement on the Vicar of Christ? In normal circumstances the only conceivable answer to that question would have been the Emperor at Constantinople; but the imperial throne was at this moment occupied by [[Irene of Athens|Irene]]. That the Empress was notorious for having blinded and murdered her own son was, in the minds of both Leo and Charles, almost immaterial: it was enough that she was a woman. The female sex was known to be incapable of governing, and by the old Salic tradition was debarred from doing so. As far as Western Europe was concerned, the Throne of the Emperors was vacant: Irene's claim to it was merely an additional proof, if any were needed, of the degradation into which the so-called Roman Empire had fallen.|[[John Julius Norwich]]{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=378}}|}}\n\n[[File:Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (German - The Coronation of Charlemagne - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=|thumb|Coronation of Charlemagne, drawing by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nFor the Pope, then, there was \"no living Emperor at that time\"{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=379}} though [[Henri Pirenne]]{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=234n}} disputes this saying that the coronation \"was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople\". Nonetheless, the Pope took the extraordinary step of creating one. The papacy had since 727 been in conflict with Irene's predecessors in Constantinople over a number of issues, chiefly the continued Byzantine adherence to the doctrine of [[iconoclasm]], the destruction of Christian images; while from 750, the secular power of the Byzantine Empire in central Italy had been nullified.\n\n[[File:Couronnement d'un prince - Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve Lat1141 f2v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coronation of an idealised king, depicted in the Sacramentary of [[Charles the Bald]] (about 870)]]\n\nBy bestowing the Imperial crown upon Charlemagne, the Pope arrogated to himself \"the right to appoint&nbsp;... the Emperor of the Romans,&nbsp;... establishing the imperial crown as his own personal gift but simultaneously granting himself implicit superiority over the Emperor whom he had created.\" And \"because the Byzantines had proved so unsatisfactory from every point of view\u2014political, military and doctrinal\u2014he would select a westerner: the one man who by his wisdom and statesmanship and the vastness of his dominions&nbsp;... stood out head and shoulders above his contemporaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Popes: A History|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-0701182908|location=|pages=55}}</ref>\n\nWith Charlemagne's coronation, therefore, \"the Roman Empire remained, so far as either of them [Charlemagne and Leo] were concerned, one and indivisible, with Charles as its Emperor\", though there can have been \"little doubt that the coronation, with all that it implied, would be furiously contested in Constantinople\".{{sfn|Norwich|1992a|p=3}}\n\n[[Alcuin]] writes hopefully in his letters of an ''Imperium Christianum'' (\"Christian Empire\"), wherein, \"just as the inhabitants of the [Roman Empire] had been united by a common Roman citizenship\", presumably this new empire would be united by a common Christian faith.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}} This writes the view of Pirenne when he says \"Charles was the Emperor of the ''ecclesia'' as the Pope conceived it, of the Roman Church, regarded as the universal Church\".{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=233}} The ''Imperium Christianum'' was further supported at a number of [[synod]]s all across Europe by Paulinus of Aquileia.<ref name=\"Butler1995\">{{cite book |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XIEAD2MC1YkC|page=74}} |title=Butler's Lives of the Saints: New Full Edition |first=Alban |last=Butler |first2=David |last2=Hugh Farmer |chapter=St Paulinus of Aquileia, Bishop (c. 726\u2013804) |pages=74\u201375 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-86012-250-0}}</ref>\n\nWhat is known, from the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p= 153}} is that Charlemagne's reaction to his coronation was to take the initial steps towards securing the Constantinopolitan throne by sending envoys of marriage to Irene, and that Irene reacted somewhat favourably to them.\n\n[[File:Raphael Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|''[[The Coronation of Charlemagne]]'', by assistants of [[Raphael]], c. 1516\u20131517]]\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the universalist and localist conceptions of the empire, which remain controversial among historians. According to the former, the empire was a universal monarchy, a \"commonwealth of the whole world, whose sublime unity transcended every minor distinction\"; and the emperor \"was entitled to the obedience of Christendom\". According to the latter, the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion; his realm was limited in the same way as that of every other ruler, and when he made more far-reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of the Pope or of the Byzantine emperor. According to this view, also, the origin of the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than by overarching theories.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire |title=Holy Roman Empire |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ohnsorge, for a long time, it had been the custom of Byzantium to designate the German princes as spiritual \"sons\" of the Romans. What might have been acceptable in the fifth century had become provoking and insulting to the Franks in the eighth century. Charles came to believe that the Roman emperor, who claimed to head the world hierarchy of states, was, in reality, no greater than Charles himself, a king as other kings, since beginning in 629 he had entitled himself \"Basileus\" (translated literally as \"king\"). Ohnsorge finds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the inscription: \"Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum [Christ, protect Charles, king of the Franks], was used from 772 to 813, even during the imperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating that Charles felt himself to be just the king of the Franks. Finally, Ohnsorge points out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his only surviving son, Louis, as the emperor without recourse to Rome with only the acclamation of his Franks. The form in which this acclamation was offered was Frankish-Christian rather than Roman. This implies both independence from Rome and a Frankish (non-Roman) understanding of empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clc-library-org-docs.angelfire.com/charlemagne.html |title=Ohnsorge, Werner, ''Das Zweikaiserproblem im fr\u00fcheren Mittelalter.

''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', Diplomata Karolinorum I, 77ff.; title used from 801 onward.</ref> (\"Charles, most serene Augustus crowned by God, the great, peaceful emperor ruling the Roman empire\") to the more direct ''Imperator Romanorum'' (\"Emperor of the Romans\").\n\nThe title of Emperor remained in the Carolingian family for years to come, but divisions of territory and in-fighting over supremacy of the Frankish state weakened its significance.{{sfn|Cantor|2015|pp=194\u201395, 212}} The papacy itself never forgot the title nor abandoned the right to bestow it. When the family of Charles ceased to produce worthy heirs, the Pope gladly crowned whichever Italian magnate could best protect him from his local enemies.

The council was not recognised by Charlemagne since no Frankish emissaries had been invited, even though Charlemagne ruled more than three provinces of the classical Roman empire and was considered equal in rank to the Byzantine emperor. And while the Pope supported the reintroduction of the iconic veneration, he politically digressed from Byzantium.<ref name=Becher2011/> He certainly desired to increase the influence of the papacy, to honour his saviour Charlemagne, and to solve the constitutional issues then most troubling to European jurists in an era when Rome was not in the hands of an emperor. Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the imperial title was not a usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians. It was, however, seen as such in Byzantium, where it was protested by Irene and her successor [[Nikephoros I]]\u2014neither of whom had any great effect in enforcing their protests.\n\nThe East Romans, however, still held several territories in Italy: Venice (what was left of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]), [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] (in [[Calabria]]), [[Otranto]] (in [[Apulia]]), and [[Naples]] (the ''[[Ducatus Neapolitanus]]''). These regions remained outside of Frankish hands until 804, when the Venetians, torn by infighting, transferred their allegiance to the Iron Crown of Pippin, Charles' son. The ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'' ended. Nicephorus ravaged the coasts with a fleet, initiating the only instance of war between the Byzantines and the Franks. The conflict lasted until 810 when the pro-Byzantine party in Venice gave their city back to the Byzantine Emperor, and the two emperors of Europe made peace: Charlemagne received the [[Istria]]n peninsula and in 812 the emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] recognised his status as Emperor,<ref>''eum imperatorem et basileum appellantes'', cf.

Pursuing his father's reforms, Charlemagne abolished the monetary system based on the gold {{lang|fr|[[solidus (coin)|sou]]}}. Instead, he and the [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon King]] [[Offa of Mercia]] took up Pippin's system for pragmatic reasons, notably a shortage of the metal.\n\nThe gold shortage was a direct consequence of the conclusion of peace with Byzantium, which resulted in ceding Venice and Sicily to the East and losing their trade routes to Africa. The resulting standardisation economically harmonised and unified the complex array of currencies that had been in use at the commencement of his reign, thus simplifying trade and commerce.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne denier Tours 793 to 812.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denier from the era of Charlemagne, [[Tours]], 793\u2013812]]\nCharlemagne established a new standard, the {{lang|fr|[[French livre|livre carolinienne]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|libra]]}}, the modern [[pound (currency)|pound]]), which was based upon a pound of silver\u2014a unit of both money and weight\u2014worth 20 sous (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]}} [which was primarily an accounting device and never actually minted], the modern [[shilling]]) or 240 {{lang|fr|[[denier (coin)|deniers]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[denarius]]}}, the modern [[penny]]). During this period, the {{lang|fr|livre}} and the {{lang|fr|sou}} were counting units; only the {{lang|fr|denier}} was a coin of the realm.\n\nCharlemagne instituted principles for [[accountancy|accounting practice]] by means of the [[Capitulare de villis]] of 802, which laid down strict rules for the way in which incomes and expenses were to be recorded.\n\nCharlemagne applied this system to much of the European continent, and Offa's standard was voluntarily adopted by much of England. After Charlemagne's death, continental coinage degraded, and most of Europe resorted to using the continued high-quality English coin until about 1100.\n\n===Jews in Charlemagne's realm===\nEarly in Charlemagne's rule he tacitly allowed Jews to monopolise money lending. At the time, lending of money for interest was proscribed in 814 because it violated Church law. Charlemagne introduced the ''[[Capitulary for the Jews]]'', a prohibition on Jews engaging in money-lending due to the religious convictions of the majority of his constituents, in essence banning it across the board, a reversal of his earlier recorded general policy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldology.com/Europe/early_dark_ages_3.htm |title=Charlemagne created a peaceful environment for Jews in his kingdom.

Carolus Magnus.jpg|thumb|Charlemagne in a copper engraving of the 16th-century by Giovanni Battista Cavalieri]]\n\nPart of Charlemagne's success as a warrior, an administrator and ruler can be traced to his admiration for learning and education. His reign is often referred to as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] because of the flowering of scholarship, literature, art and architecture that characterise it. Charlemagne came into contact with the culture and learning of other countries (especially Moorish Spain, Anglo-Saxon England,<ref>''Charlemagne and Anglo-Saxon England'', Joanna Story, ''Charlemagne: Empire and Society'', ed. Joanna Story, (Manchester University Press, 2005), 195.</ref> and Lombard Italy) due to his vast conquests. He greatly increased the provision of monastic schools and scriptoria (centres for book-copying) in Francia.\n\nCharlemagne was a lover of books, sometimes having them read to him during meals. He was thought to enjoy the works of [[Augustine of Hippo]].<ref name=\"onlinelibrary.wiley.com\">{{cite journal |last=Bullough |first=Donald A. |authorlink=Donald A.

Due to the increased interest of intellectual pursuits and the urging of their king, the monks accomplished so much copying that almost every manuscript from that time was preserved. At the same time, at the urging of their king, scholars were producing more secular books on many subjects, including history, poetry, art, music, law, theology, etc. Due to the increased number of titles, private libraries flourished. These were mainly supported by aristocrats and churchmen who could afford to sustain them. At Charlemagne's court, a library was founded and a number of copies of books were produced, to be distributed by Charlemagne.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Charlemagne's court library revisited|journal=Early Medieval Europe|year=2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=339\u201363|doi=10.1111/j.0963-9462.2004.00141.x}}</ref><ref name=\"Anderson2013\" /> Book production was completed slowly by hand and took place mainly in large monastic libraries.

Indeed, the earliest manuscripts available for many ancient texts are Carolingian. It is almost certain that a text which survived to the Carolingian age survives still.\n\nThe pan-European nature of Charlemagne's influence is indicated by the origins of many of the men who worked for him: [[Alcuin]], an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] from [[York]]; [[Theodulf]], a [[Visigoths|Visigoth]], probably from [[Septimania]]; [[Paul the Deacon]], Lombard; [[Italians]] [[Peter of Pisa]] and [[Saint Paulinus II|Paulinus of Aquileia]]; and Franks [[Angilbert]], Angilram, [[Einhard]] and [[Waldo of Reichenau]].\n\nCharlemagne promoted the [[liberal arts]] at court, ordering that his children and grandchildren be well-educated, and even studying himself (in a time when even leaders who promoted education did not take time to learn themselves) under the tutelage of Peter of Pisa, from whom he learned grammar; Alcuin, with whom he studied rhetoric, dialectic (logic), and astronomy (he was particularly interested in the movements of the stars); and Einhard, who tutored him in arithmetic.{{sfn|Dutton|2016}}\n\nHis great scholarly failure, as Einhard relates, was his inability to write: when in his old age he attempted to learn\u2014practising the formation of letters in his bed during his free time on books and wax tablets he hid under his pillow\u2014\"his effort came too late in life and achieved little success\", and his ability to read\u2014which Einhard is silent about, and which no contemporary source supports\u2014has also been called into question.{{sfn|Dutton|2016}}\n\nIn 800, Charlemagne enlarged the hostel at the [[Muristan]] in [[Jerusalem]] and added a library to it. He certainly had not been personally in Jerusalem.<ref>Karl der Grosse und das Erbe der Kulturen, Band 1999, Franz-Reiner Erkens, Akademie Verlag, 2001.</ref><ref>Saint-Denis zwischen Adel und K\u00f6nig, Rolf Gro\u00dfe, Thorbecke, Stuttgart 2002.</ref>\n\n===Church reforms===\n{{See also|Charlemagne and church music}}\n[[File:Aachen Cathedral top floor.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Charlemagne's chapel]] at [[Aachen Cathedral]]]]\n\nCharlemagne expanded the reform Church's programme unlike his father, Pippin, and uncle, Carloman. The deepening of the spiritual life was later to be seen as central to public policy and royal governance. His reform focused on strengthening the church's power structure, improving clergy's skill and moral quality, standardising liturgical practices, improvements on the basic tenets of the faith and the rooting out of paganism. His authority extended over church and state. He could discipline clerics, control ecclesiastical property and define orthodox doctrine. Despite the harsh legislation and sudden change, he had developed support from clergy who approved his desire to deepen the piety and morals of his subjects.<ref name=britannica>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106546/Charlemagne |title=Charlemagne |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date= 2012 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 809\u2013810, Charlemagne called a church council in [[Aachen]], which confirmed the unanimous belief in the West that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (''ex Patre [[Filioque]]'') and sanctioned inclusion in the [[Nicene Creed]] of the phrase ''Filioque'' (and the Son). For this Charlemagne sought the approval of [[Pope Leo III]]. The Pope, while affirming the doctrine and approving its use in teaching, opposed its inclusion in the text of the Creed as adopted in the 381 [[First Council of Constantinople]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sterk |first=Andrea |date=1 October 1988 |title=The Silver Shields of Pope Leo III: A Reassessment of the Evidence |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3859m82c |journal=Comitatus: A Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies |volume=19|pages=62\u201379}}</ref> This spoke of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father, without adding phrases such as \"and the Son\", \"through the Son\", or \"alone\".

[[Carolingian minuscule]] was created partly under the patronage of Charlemagne. [[Alcuin]], who ran the palace school and [[scriptorium]] at Aachen, was probably a chief influence.\n\nThe revolutionary character of the Carolingian reform, however, can be over-emphasised; efforts at taming Merovingian and Germanic influence had been underway before Alcuin arrived at Aachen. The new minuscule was disseminated first from Aachen and later from the influential scriptorium at [[Tours]], where Alcuin retired as an abbot.\n\n===Political reforms===\nCharlemagne engaged in many reforms of Frankish governance while continuing many traditional practices, such as the division of the kingdom among sons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The rise of the medieval world, 500\u20131300: a biographical dictionary|last=Schulman|first=Jana K.|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0313011085|location=Westport, CN|page=xx}}</ref>\n\n====Divisio regnorum====\nIn 806, Charlemagne first made provision for the traditional division of the empire on his death. For Charles the Younger he designated Austrasia and Neustria, Saxony, Burgundy and [[Thuringia]]. To Pippin, he gave Italy, Bavaria, and [[Swabia]]. Louis received Aquitaine, the Spanish March and [[Provence]]. The imperial title was not mentioned, which led to the suggestion that, at that particular time, Charlemagne regarded the title as an honorary achievement that held no hereditary significance.\n\nPepin died in 810 and Charles in 811. Charlemagne then reconsidered the matter, and in 813, crowned his youngest son, Louis, co-emperor and co-King of the Franks, granting him a half-share of the empire and the rest upon Charlemagne's own death. The only part of the Empire that Louis was not promised was Italy, which Charlemagne specifically bestowed upon Pippin's illegitimate son [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LUCPcwybApIC&pg=PA10&dq=Bernard+of+Italy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4mIyl-5PXAhVCOyYKHUBcD6oQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=Bernard%20of%20Italy&f=false Noble, Thomas F.

The author of the ''[[Visio Karoli Magni]]'' written around 865 uses facts gathered apparently from Einhard and his own observations on the decline of Charlemagne's family after the dissensions war (840\u201343) as the basis for a visionary tale of Charles' meeting with a prophetic spectre in a dream.\n\nCharlemagne was a model [[knight]] as one of the [[Nine Worthies]] who enjoyed an important legacy in European culture. One of the great medieval [[literary cycle]]s, the Charlemagne cycle or the ''[[Matter of France]]'', centres on his deeds\u2014the Emperor with the Flowing Beard of ''[[Song of Roland|Roland]]'' fame\u2014and his historical commander of the border with [[Brittany]], [[Roland]], and the 12 [[paladin]]s.

It should. It seems to be based, in large part, on the historical adventures of Charlemagne, the Frankish King of the Ninth Century, who eventually became Emperor. Looking at Charlemagne's life and personality, it becomes clear that he and Geoffrey's Arthur are practically twins.\"</ref> During the [[Hundred Years' War]] in the 14th century, there was considerable cultural conflict in England, where the [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] rulers were aware of their French roots and identified with Charlemagne, Anglo-Saxon natives felt more affinity for Arthur, whose own legends were relatively primitive. Therefore, storytellers in England adapted legends of Charlemagne and his 12 Peers to the Arthurian tales.<ref>[http://www.mementomedievalia.com/charlemagne-king-arthur-and-contested-national-identity-in-english-romances/ Charlemagne, King Arthur and Contested National Identity in English Romances]<br /> Modelling his narrative on earlier Middle English texts, the English AMA-poet, appropriates aspects of the historical reality of Charlemagne and refashions them to fit Arthur, creating a hero that the English can claim as their own.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', the spirit of Charlemagne appears to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] in the [[Paradiso (Dante)#Fifth Sphere (Mars: The Warriors of the Faith)|Heaven of Mars]], among the other \"warriors of the faith\".<ref name=\"DLS17\">[[Dorothy L.

Charles was succeeded in 741 by his sons [[Carloman (mayor of the palace)|Carloman]] and [[Pepin the Short]], the father of Charlemagne. In 743, the brothers placed [[Childeric III]] on the throne to curb separatism in the periphery. He was the last Merovingian king. Carloman resigned office in 746, preferring to enter the church as a monk. Pepin brought the question of the kingship before [[Pope Zachary]], asking whether it was logical for a king to have no royal power. The pope handed down his decision in 749, decreeing that it was better for Pepin to be called king, as he had the powers of high office as Mayor, so as not to confuse the hierarchy. He, therefore, ordered him to become the ''true king''.<ref name=\"France/Pippin\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/40284/Pippin-III |title=France :: Pippin III \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=24 April 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 750, Pepin was elected by an assembly of the Franks, anointed by the archbishop, and then raised to the office of king. The Pope branded Childeric III as \"the false king\" and ordered him into a monastery. The Merovingian dynasty was thereby replaced by the [[Carolingian]] dynasty, named after Charles Martel. In 753, [[Pope Stephen II]] fled from Italy to Francia, appealing to Pepin for assistance for the rights of St. Peter. He was supported in this appeal by Carloman, Charles' brother<!---should this be Pepin's brother?- Apparently not; Pepin's brother only left the monastery (Monte Cassino), to plead that Pepin NOT provide aid to Stephen II, and was then imprisoned. Carloman, son of Pepin and brother to Charles, supported Stephen II, and was named along with his father and brother as kings.-->. In return, the pope could provide only legitimacy. He did this by again anointing and confirming Pepin, this time adding his young sons Carolus (Charlemagne) and Carloman to the royal patrimony. They thereby became heirs to the realm that already covered most of western Europe. In 754, Pepin accepted the Pope's invitation to visit Italy on behalf of St. Peter's rights, dealing successfully with the [[Lombards]].<ref name=\"France/Pippin\" /><ref>The background relies heavily on {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745\u2013755}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Carolingians, the Frankish kingdom spread to encompass an area including most of Western Europe; the east-west division of the kingdom formed the basis for modern [[History of France|France]] and [[History of Germany|Germany]]. Orman{{sfn|Oman|1914|pp=409\u201310}} portrays the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843) between the warring grandsons of Charlemagne as the foundation event of an independent [[France]] under its first king [[Charles the Bald]]; an independent Germany under its first king [[Louis the German]]; and an independent intermediate state stretching from the [[Low Countries]] along the borderlands to south of Rome under [[Lothair I]], who retained the title of emperor and the capitals [[Aachen]] and [[Rome]] without the jurisdiction. The middle kingdom had broken up by 890 and partly absorbed into the Western kingdom (later France) and the Eastern kingdom (Germany) and the rest developing into smaller \"buffer\" nations that exist between France and Germany to this day, namely the [[Benelux]] and [[Switzerland]]. \n==Rise to power==\n\n===Early life===\n\n====Date of birth====\nThe most likely date of Charlemagne's birth is reconstructed from several sources.

The year given in the ''[[Annales Petaviani]]'', 747, would be more likely, except that it contradicts Einhard and a few other sources in making Charlemagne sixty-seven years old at his death.

Elections were not periodic, but were held as required to elect officers ''ad quos summa imperii pertinebat'', \"to whom the highest matters of state pertained\". Evidently, interim decisions could be made by the Pope, which ultimately needed to be ratified using an assembly of the people that met annually.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=1. The Merovingian Family}}\n\nBefore he was elected king in 751, Pepin was initially a mayor, a high office he held \"as though hereditary\" (''velut hereditario fungebatur''). Einhard explains that \"the honour\" was usually \"given by the people\" to the distinguished, but Pepin the Great and his brother Carloman the Wise received it as though hereditary, as had their father, [[Charles Martel]]. There was, however, a certain ambiguity about quasi-inheritance. The office was treated as joint property: one Mayorship held by two brothers jointly.<ref>The ''Annales'' uses maiores domus, a plural followed by a singular: one house, two chief officers. {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 742}}</ref> Each, however, had his own geographic jurisdiction. When Carloman decided to resign, becoming ultimately a Benedictine at [[Monte Cassino]],{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745, 746}} the question of the disposition of his quasi-share was settled by the pope. He converted the mayorship into a kingship and awarded the joint property to Pepin, who gained the right to pass it on by inheritance.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}}\n\nThis decision was not accepted by all family members. Carloman had consented to the temporary tenancy of his own share, which he intended to pass on to his son, Drogo, when the inheritance should be settled at someone's death. By the Pope's decision, in which Pepin had a hand, Drogo was to be disqualified as an heir in favour of his cousin Charles. He took up arms in opposition to the decision and was joined by [[Grifo]], a half-brother of Pepin and Carloman, who had been given a share by Charles Martel, but was stripped of it and held under loose arrest by his half-brothers after an attempt to seize their shares by military action. Grifo perished in combat in the Battle of [[Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne]] while Drogo was hunted down and taken into custody.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nOn the death of Pepin, 24 September 768, the kingship passed jointly to his sons, \"with divine assent\" (''divino nutu'').{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=3. Charlemagne's Accession}} According to the ''Life'', Pepin died in Paris. The Franks \"in general assembly\" (''generali conventu'') gave them both the rank of a king (''reges'') but \"partitioned the whole body of the kingdom equally\" (''totum regni corpus ex aequo partirentur''). The ''annals''{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 768}} tell a slightly different version, with the king dying at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Denis]], near Paris. The two \"lords\" (''domni'') were \"elevated to kingship\" (''elevati sunt in regnum''), Charles on 9 October in [[Noyon]], Carloman on an unspecified date in [[Soissons]]. If born in 742, Charles was 26 years old, but he had been campaigning at his father's right hand for several years, which may help to account for his military skill. [[Carloman I|Carloman]] was 17.\n\nThe language, in either case, suggests that there were not two inheritances, which would have created distinct kings ruling over distinct kingdoms, but a single joint inheritance and a joint kingship tenanted by two equal kings, Charles and his brother Carloman. As before, distinct jurisdictions were awarded. Charles received Pepin's original share as Mayor: the outer parts of the kingdom bordering on the sea, namely [[Neustria]], western [[Aquitaine]], and the northern parts of [[Austrasia]]; while Carloman was awarded his uncle's former share, the inner parts: southern Austrasia, [[Septimania]], eastern Aquitaine, [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Provence, and [[Swabia]], lands bordering [[Italy]]. The question of whether these jurisdictions were joint shares reverting to the other brother if one brother died or were inherited property passed on to the descendants of the brother who died was never definitely settled. It came up repeatedly over the succeeding decades until the grandsons of Charlemagne created distinct sovereign kingdoms.\n\n===Aquitainian rebellion===\n====Formation of a new Aquitaine====\n{{main|Aquitaine}}\n\n[[Aquitaine]] under Rome had been in southern [[Gaul]], Romanised and speaking a [[Romance language]]. Similarly, [[Hispania]] had been populated by peoples who spoke various languages, including [[Celtic language|Celtic]], but the area was now populated primarily by Romance language speakers. Between Aquitaine and Hispania were the [[Basques|Euskaldunak]], Latinised to [[Vascones]], or [[Basques]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=32}} living in Basque country, Vasconia, which extended, according to the distributions of place names attributable to the Basques, most densely in the western [[Pyrenees]] but also as far south as the upper [[Ebro River]] in Spain and as far north as the [[Garonne River]] in France.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=105}} The French name, [[Gascony]], derives from [[Vasconia]]. The Romans were never able to entirely subject Vasconia. The parts they did, in which they placed the region's first cities, were sources of legions in the Roman army valued for their fighting abilities. The border with Aquitaine was [[Toulouse]].\n\nAt about 660, the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] united with the [[Duke of Aquitaine|Duchy of Aquitaine]] to form a single realm under [[Felix of Aquitaine]], governing from Toulouse. This was a joint kingship with a Basque Duke, [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus I]]. ''Lupus'' is the Latin translation of Basque Otsoa, \"wolf\".{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|pp=36\u201337}} At Felix's death in 670 the joint property of the kingship reverted entirely to Lupus. As the Basques had no law of joint inheritance but practised [[primogeniture]], [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus]] in effect founded a hereditary dynasty of Basque rulers of an expanded Aquitaine.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=100}}\n\n====Acquisition of Aquitaine by the Carolingians====\n{{further|Umayyad conquest of Hispania}}\n[[File:Al-Andalus732.jpg|thumb|Moorish Hispania in 732]]\n\nThe Latin chronicles of the end of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] omit many details, such as identification of characters, filling in the gaps and reconciliation of numerous contradictions.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2004|pp=130\u201331}}, \"The sequence of events...has not been assisted by the tendency of the historians to take all the information...from all the available sources and combine it to produce a single synthetic account...As a rule of thumb, reliability, and also brevity of narrative, are usually in direct proportion to chronological proximity.\"</ref> Muslim sources, however, present a more coherent view, such as in the ''Ta'rikh iftitah al-Andalus'' (\"History of the Conquest of al-Andalus\") by [[Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya]] (\"the son of the Gothic woman\", referring to the granddaughter of [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania, who married a Moor). Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya, who had another, much longer name, must have been relying to some degree on family oral tradition.\n\nAccording to Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya{{sfn|James|2009|p=49}} [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania died before his three sons, Almund, Romulo, and Ardabast reached maturity. Their mother was [[queen regent]] at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], but [[Roderic]], army chief of staff, staged a rebellion, capturing [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He chose to impose a joint rule over distinct jurisdictions on the true heirs. Evidence of a division of some sort can be found in the distribution of coins imprinted with the name of each king and in the king lists.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=131\u201332}} Wittiza was succeeded by Roderic, who reigned for seven and a half years, followed by Achila (Aquila), who reigned three and a half years. If the reigns of both terminated with the incursion of the [[Saracens]], then Roderic appears to have reigned a few years before the majority of Achila. The latter's kingdom is securely placed to the northeast, while Roderic seems to have taken the rest, notably modern [[Portugal]].\n\nThe Saracens crossed the mountains to claim Ardo's [[Septimania]], only to encounter the Basque dynasty of Aquitaine, always the allies of the Goths. [[Odo the Great]] of [[Aquitaine]] was at first victorious at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721.{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|p=40}} Saracen troops gradually massed in Septimania and in 732 an army under Emir [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] advanced into Vasconia, and Odo was defeated at the [[Battle of the River Garonne]]. They took [[Bordeaux]] and were advancing towards [[Tours]] when Odo, powerless to stop them, appealed to his arch-enemy, [[Charles Martel]], mayor of the Franks. In one of the first of the lightning marches for which the Carolingian kings became famous, Charles and his army appeared in the path of the Saracens between Tours and [[Poitiers]], and in the [[Battle of Tours]] decisively defeated and killed al-Ghafiqi. The Moors returned twice more, each time suffering defeat at Charles' hands\u2014at the River Berre near Narbonne in 737{{sfn|Einhard|2007|p=24}} and in the [[Dauphin\u00e9]] in 740.<ref name=\"Lewis2009\">{{cite book|first=David Levering |last=Lewis|title=God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570\u20131215|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=NwA7mQEACAAJ|page=177}}|date=2009|publisher=W.W.

However, Odo had ambiguously left the kingdom jointly to his two sons, Hunald and Hatto. The latter, loyal to Francia, now went to war with his brother over full possession. Victorious, Hunald blinded and imprisoned his brother, only to be so stricken by conscience that he resigned and entered the church as a monk to do penance. The story is told in [[Annales Mettenses priores]].<ref name=\"Freeman1904\">{{cite book|first=Edward Augustus |last=Freeman|title=Western Europe in the Eighth Century & Onward: An Aftermath|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5HCIvgAACAAJ|page=74}}|year=1904|publisher=Macmillan and Company, limited| page=74}}</ref> His son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] took an early inheritance, becoming duke of Aquitaine and ratified the alliance with Lombardy. Waifer decided to honour it, repeating his father's decision, which he justified by arguing that any agreements with Charles Martel became invalid on Martel's death. Since [[Aquitaine]] was now Pepin's inheritance because of the earlier assistance that was given by Charles Martel, according to some the latter and his son, the young Charles, hunted down Waifer, who could only conduct a guerrilla war, and executed him.{{sfn|Russell|1930|p=88}}\n\nAmong the contingents of the Frankish army were [[Bavaria]]ns under [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria]], an [[Agilofing]], the hereditary Bavarian ducal family. [[Grifo]] had installed himself as Duke of Bavaria, but Pepin replaced him with a member of the ducal family yet a child, Tassilo, whose protector he had become after the death of his father. The loyalty of the Agilolfings was perpetually in question, but Pepin exacted numerous oaths of loyalty from Tassilo. However, the latter had married [[Liutperga]], a daughter of [[Desiderius]], king of [[Lombardy]]. At a critical point in the campaign, Tassilo left the field with all his Bavarians. Out of reach of Pepin, he repudiated all loyalty to Francia.{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|pp=118\u201325}} Pepin had no chance to respond as he grew ill and died within a few weeks after Waifer's execution.\n\nThe first event of the brothers' reign was the uprising of the Aquitainians and [[Gascony|Gascons]], in 769, in that territory split between the two kings. One year earlier, Pepin had finally defeated [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], after waging a destructive, ten-year war against Aquitaine. Now, [[Hunald II]] led the Aquitainians as far north as [[Angoul\u00eame]]. Charles met Carloman, but Carloman refused to participate and returned to Burgundy. Charles went to war, leading an army to [[Bordeaux]], where he set up a fort at Fronsac. Hunald was forced to flee to the court of Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupus&nbsp;II of Gascony]]. Lupus, fearing Charles, turned Hunald over in exchange for peace, and Hunald was put in a monastery. Gascon lords also surrendered, and Aquitaine and [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]] were finally fully subdued by the Franks.\n\n===Marriage to Desiderata===\nThe brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother Bertrada, but in 770 Charles signed a treaty with Duke [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] and married a Lombard Princess (commonly known today as [[Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne|Desiderata]]), the daughter of King [[Desiderius]], to surround Carloman with his own allies. Though [[Pope Stephen III]] first opposed the marriage with the Lombard princess, he found little to fear from a Frankish-Lombard alliance.\n\nLess than a year after his marriage, Charlemagne repudiated Desiderata and married a 13-year-old Swabian named [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]]. The repudiated Desiderata returned to her father's court at [[Pavia]]. Her father's wrath was now aroused, and he would have gladly allied with Carloman to defeat Charles. Before any open hostilities could be declared, however, Carloman died on 5 December 771, apparently of natural causes. Carloman's widow [[Gerberge, wife of Carloman|Gerberga]] fled to Desiderius' court with her sons for protection.\n\n== Wives, concubines, and children ==\nCharlemagne had eighteen children with eight of his ten known wives or concubines.<ref>Durant, Will.

In addition, he had a grandson ([[Bernard of Italy]], the only son of his third son, [[Pepin of Italy]]), who was illegitimate but included in the line of inheritance. Among his descendants are several royal dynasties, including the [[Habsburg]], [[Capetian]] and [[Plantagenet]] dynasties. By consequence, most if not all established European noble families ever since can genealogically trace their background to Charlemagne.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Start date\n! Wives and their children\n! Concubines and their children\n|-\n| c.768\n| His first relationship was with [[Himiltrude]]. The nature of this relationship is variously described as [[concubinage]], a legal marriage, or a [[Friedelehe]].<ref>Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] (Vita Karoli Magni, ch. 20) calls her a \"concubine\" and [[Paulus Diaconus]] speaks of Pippin's birth \"before legal marriage\", whereas a letter by [[Pope Stephen III]] refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and [[Gerberga, wife of Carloman I|Gerberga]]), and advises them not to dismiss their wives. Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as [[Pierre Rich\u00e9]] (''The Carolingians'', p.86.), follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine. Others, for example Dieter H\u00e4gemann (''Karl der Gro\u00dfe. Herrscher des Abendlands'', p. 82f.), consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was \"something more than concubinage, less than marriage\" and describe it as a [[Friedelehe]], a form of marriage unrecognised by the Church and easily dissolvable. Russell Chamberlin (''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. 61.), for instance, compared it with the English system of common-law marriage. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.</ref> (Charlemagne put her aside when he married Desiderata.)

The younger of the two, [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], became [[King of Aquitaine]]. Charlemagne ordered Pepin and Louis to be raised in the customs of their kingdoms, and he gave their regents some control of their subkingdoms, but kept the real power, though he intended his sons to inherit their realms. He did not tolerate insubordination in his sons: in 792, he banished Pepin the Hunchback to [[Pr\u00fcm Abbey]] because the young man had joined a rebellion against him.\n\nCharles was determined to have his children educated, including his daughters, as his parents had instilled the importance of learning in him at an early age.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hbnY8GTet_kC}}|title=Charlemagne |last=Gelfand|first=Dale Evva|date=2003|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438117850|language=en}}</ref> His children were also taught skills in accord with their aristocratic status, which included training in riding and weaponry for his sons, and embroidery, spinning and weaving for his daughters.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bQlJP9O9hKkC}}|title=Daily Life in the Age of Charlemagne|last=Butt|first=John J.|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313316685|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe sons fought many wars on behalf of their father. [[Charles the Younger|Charles]] was mostly preoccupied with the Bretons, whose border he shared and who insurrected on at least two occasions and were easily put down. He also fought the Saxons on multiple occasions. In 805 and 806, he was sent into the B\u00f6hmerwald (modern [[Bohemia]]) to deal with the Slavs living there (Bohemian tribes, ancestors of the modern [[Czech people|Czechs]]). He subjected them to Frankish authority and devastated the valley of the Elbe, forcing tribute from them. Pippin had to hold the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] and Beneventan borders and fought the [[Slavs]] to his north. He was uniquely poised to fight the [[Byzantine Empire]] when that conflict arose after Charlemagne's imperial coronation and a [[Venetia (region)|Venetian]] rebellion. Finally, Louis was in charge of the [[Spanish March]] and fought the Duke of Benevento in southern Italy on at least one occasion.

However, he tolerated their extramarital relationships, even rewarding their common-law husbands and treasuring the illegitimate grandchildren they produced for him. He also, apparently, refused to believe stories of their wild behaviour. After his death the surviving daughters were banished from the court by their brother, the pious Louis, to take up residence in the convents they had been bequeathed by their father.

There he confirmed [[Donation of Pepin|his father's grants of land]],<ref name=\"Campaigns\" /> with some later chronicles falsely claiming that he also expanded them, granting [[Tuscany]], [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], Venice and [[Corsica]]. The pope granted him the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]''. He then returned to Pavia, where the Lombards were on the verge of surrendering. In return for their lives, the Lombards surrendered and opened the gates in early summer. Desiderius was sent to the [[abbey]] of [[Corbie]], and his son Adelchis died in [[Constantinople]], a patrician. Charles, unusually, had himself crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] and made the magnates of Lombardy pay homage to him at Pavia. Only Duke [[Arechis II of Benevento]] refused to submit and proclaimed independence. Charlemagne was then master of Italy as king of the Lombards. He left Italy with a garrison in Pavia and a few Frankish counts in place the same year.\n\nInstability continued in Italy. In 776, Dukes [[Hrodgaud of Friuli]] and [[Hildeprand of Spoleto]] rebelled.

He took refuge with the ally Duke [[Lupus II of Gascony]], but probably out of fear of Charlemagne's reprisal, Lupus handed him over to the new King of the Franks to whom he pledged loyalty, which seemed to confirm the peace in [[Duchy of Vasconia|the Basque area]] south of the [[Garonne]].<ref name=Lewis>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Archibald Ross |year=1965 |title=The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society 718\u20131050 |publisher=University of Texas Press |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nWary of new Basque uprisings, Charlemagne seems to have tried to contain Duke Lupus's power by appointing [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin]] as the Count of Bordeaux (778) and other counts of Frankish background in bordering areas ([[History of Toulouse#768\u2013877: Carolingian Franks and the Kingdom of Aquitaine|Toulouse]], [[County of F\u00e9zensac]]). The [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basque]] Duke, in turn, seems to have contributed decisively or schemed the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (referred to as \"Basque treachery\"). The defeat of Charlemagne's army in Roncevaux (778) confirmed his determination to rule directly by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine (ruled by [[Louis the Pious]]) based on a power base of Frankish officials, distributing lands among colonisers and allocating lands to the Church, which he took as an ally. A Christianisation programme was put in place across the high [[Pyrenees]] (778).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\n[[File:771 CE, Europe.svg|thumb|Europe in 771]]\nThe new political arrangement for Vasconia did not sit well with local lords. As of 788 [[Adalric of Gascony|Adalric]] was fighting and capturing [[Torson of Toulouse|Chorson]], Carolingian Count of Toulouse. He was eventually released, but Charlemagne, enraged at the compromise, decided to depose him and appointed his trustee [[William of Gellone]]. William, in turn, fought the Basques and defeated them after banishing Adalric (790).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\nFrom 781 ([[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagor\u00e7a]]) to 806 ([[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]] under Frankish influence), taking the County of Toulouse for a power base, Charlemagne asserted Frankish authority over the Pyrenees by subduing the south-western marches of Toulouse (790) and establishing vassal counties on the southern Pyrenees that were to make up the [[Marca Hispanica]].{{sfn|Lewis|1965|p=40}} As of 794, a Frankish vassal, the Basque lord Belasko (''al-Galashki'', 'the Gaul') ruled [[\u00c1lava]], but Pamplona remained under Cordovan and local control up to 806. Belasko and the counties in the Marca Hisp\u00e1nica provided the necessary base to attack the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] (an expedition led by [[William of Gellone|William Count of Toulouse]] and Louis the Pious to capture Barcelona in 801). Events in the Duchy of Vasconia (rebellion in Pamplona, [[Aznar Gal\u00edndez I|count overthrown in Aragon]], Duke Seguin of Bordeaux deposed, uprising of the Basque lords, etc.) were to prove it ephemeral upon Charlemagne's death.\n\n===Roncesvalles campaign===\nAccording to the Muslim historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of [[Paderborn]] had received the representatives of the Muslim rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Huesca]]. Their masters had been cornered in the [[Iberian peninsula]] by [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], the [[Umayyad]] [[emir of C\u00f3rdoba|emir of Cordova]]. These \"Saracen\" ([[Moorish]] and [[Muladi]]) rulers offered their homage to the king of the Franks in return for military support. Seeing an opportunity to extend [[Christendom]] and his own power and believing the Saxons to be a fully conquered nation, Charlemagne agreed to go to Spain.\n\nIn 778, he led the Neustrian army across the Western [[Pyrenees]], while the Austrasians, Lombards, and Burgundians passed over the Eastern Pyrenees. The armies met at Saragossa and Charlemagne received the homage of the Muslim rulers, Sulayman al-Arabi and Kasmin ibn Yusuf, but the city did not fall for him. Indeed, Charlemagne faced the toughest battle of his career. The Muslims forced him to retreat. He decided to go home since he could not trust the [[Basques]], whom he had subdued by conquering [[Pamplona]]. He turned to leave Iberia, but as he was passing through the Pass of [[Roncesvalles]] one of the most famous events of his reign occurred. The Basques attacked and destroyed his rearguard and baggage train. The [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]], though less a battle than a skirmish, left many famous dead, including the [[seneschal]] Eggihard, the count of the palace Anselm, and the [[wikt:warden|warden]] of the [[Breton March]], [[Roland]], inspiring the subsequent creation of the [[Song of Roland]] (''La Chanson de Roland'').\n\n===Contact with the Saracens===\n[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Harun al-Rashid]] receiving a delegation of Charlemagne in [[Baghdad]], by [[Julius K\u00f6ckert]] (1864)]]\n\nThe conquest of Italy brought Charlemagne in contact with the [[Saracen]]s who, at the time, controlled the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Charlemagne's eldest son, [[Pepin the Hunchback]], was much occupied with Saracens in Italy. Charlemagne conquered [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] at an unknown date and in 799 the [[Balearic Islands]]. The islands were often attacked by Saracen pirates, but the counts of [[Genoa]] and Tuscany ([[Boniface I of Tuscany|Boniface]]) controlled them with large fleets until the end of Charlemagne's reign. Charlemagne even had contact with the [[caliph]]al court in [[Baghdad]]. In 797 (or possibly 801), the caliph of Baghdad, [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented Charlemagne with an [[Asian elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] and a [[clock]].<ref name=\"Heck2007\">{{cite book|first=Gene W. |last=Heck|title=When Worlds Collide: Exploring the Ideological and Political Foundations of the Clash of Civilizations|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dtAyMXqaozwC|page=172}}|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-5856-4|pages=172\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Wars with the Moors===\n\nIn [[Hispania]], the struggle against the Moors continued unabated throughout the latter half of his reign. Louis was in charge of the Spanish border. In 785, his men captured Girona permanently and extended Frankish control into the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] littoral for the duration of Charlemagne's reign (the area remained nominally Frankish until the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]] in 1258). The Muslim chiefs in the northeast of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] were constantly rebelling against Cordovan authority, and they often turned to the Franks for help. The Frankish border was slowly extended until 795, when Girona, [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Ausona]] and [[County of Urgell|Urgell]] were united into the new [[Spanish March]], within the old duchy of [[Septimania]].\n\nIn 797, [[Barcelona]], the greatest city of the region, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Cordova and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis of Aquitaine marched the entire army of his kingdom over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. The Franks continued to press forward against the [[emir]]. They took [[Tarragona]] in 809 and [[Tortosa]] in 811. The last conquest brought them to the mouth of the [[Ebro]] and gave them raiding access to [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], prompting the Emir [[al-Hakam I]] to recognise their conquests in 813.\n\n==Eastern campaigns==\n\n===Saxon Wars===\n{{Further|Saxon Wars}}\n[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map showing Charlemagne's additions (in light green) to the Frankish Kingdom]]\n\nCharlemagne was engaged in almost constant warfare throughout his reign,<ref>France, John, \"The Composition and Raising of the Armies of Charlemagne\", in Journal of Medieval Military History, ed. B. Bachrach (2002), pp. 63\u201365</ref> often at the head of his elite ''[[scara]]'' bodyguard squadrons. In the [[Saxon Wars]], spanning thirty years and eighteen battles, he conquered [[Old Saxony|Saxonia]] and proceeded to convert it to Christianity.\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Saxons]] were divided into four subgroups in four regions. Nearest to [[Austrasia]] was [[Westphalia]] and furthest away was [[Eastphalia]]. Between them was [[Engria]] and north of these three, at the base of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, was [[Nordalbingia]].\n\nIn his first campaign, in 773, Charlemagne forced the Engrians to submit and cut down an [[Irminsul]] pillar near [[Paderborn]].<ref>Revised annals of the kingdom of the Franks, ed. and trans. King, Sources, p. 110</ref> The campaign was cut short by his first expedition to Italy. He returned in 775, marching through Westphalia and conquering the Saxon fort at [[Sigiburg]]. He then crossed Engria, where he defeated the Saxons again. Finally, in Eastphalia, he defeated a Saxon force, and its leader [[Hessi]] converted to Christianity. Charlemagne returned through Westphalia, leaving encampments at Sigiburg and [[Eresburg]], which had been important Saxon bastions. He then controlled Saxony with the exception of Nordalbingia, but Saxon resistance had not ended.\n\nFollowing his subjugation of the Dukes of Friuli and Spoleto, Charlemagne returned rapidly to Saxony in 776, where a rebellion had destroyed his fortress at Eresburg. The Saxons were once again defeated, but their main leader, [[Widukind]], escaped to Denmark, his wife's home. Charlemagne built a new camp at [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt]]. In 777, he called a national diet at Paderborn to integrate Saxony fully into the Frankish kingdom. Many Saxons were baptised as Christians.\n\nIn the summer of 779, he again invaded Saxony and reconquered Eastphalia, Engria and Westphalia. At a diet near [[Lippe]], he divided the land into missionary districts and himself assisted in several mass baptisms (780). He then returned to Italy and, for the first time, the Saxons did not immediately revolt. Saxony was peaceful from 780 to 782.\n\n[[File:Ary Scheffer, Charlemagne re\u00e7oit la soumission de Widukind \u00e0 Paderborn, (1840).jpg|thumb|left|Charlemagne receiving the submission of [[Widukind]] at [[Paderborn]] in 785, painted c.&nbsp;1840 by [[Ary Scheffer]]]]\n\nHe returned to Saxony in 782 and instituted a code of law and appointed counts, both Saxon and Frank. The laws were draconian on religious issues; for example, the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'' prescribed death to Saxon pagans who refused to convert to Christianity. This led to renewed conflict. That year, in autumn, Widukind returned and led a new revolt. In response, at [[Verden, Germany|Verden]] in Lower Saxony, Charlemagne is recorded as having ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners by beheading, known as the [[Massacre of Verden]] (\"Verdener Blutgericht\"). The killings triggered three years of renewed bloody warfare. During this war, the [[East Frisia]]ns between the [[Lauwers]] and the [[Weser]] joined the Saxons in revolt and were finally subdued.<ref>Oebele Vries, \"Friesland\", ''Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 2001), pp. 252\u201356.</ref> The war ended with Widukind accepting baptism.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yW-GfElbafQC&pg=PA368|title=Encyclopedia of Barbarian Europe: Society in Transformation|first=Michael|last=Frassetto|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=9781576072639|chapter=Widukind|page=368}}</ref> The Frisians afterwards asked for missionaries to be sent to them and a bishop of their own nation, [[Ludger]], was sent.

Subsidia, '''13''', 1\u201315.</ref>\n\nThereafter, the Saxons maintained the peace for seven years, but in 792 Westphalia again rebelled. The Eastphalians and Nordalbingians joined them in 793, but the insurrection was unpopular and was put down by 794. An Engrian rebellion followed in 796, but the presence of Charlemagne, Christian Saxons and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] quickly crushed it. The last insurrection occurred in 804, more than thirty years after Charlemagne's first campaign against them, but also failed. According to Einhard:\n{{quote|\nThe war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the King; which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.\n}}\n\n===Submission of Bavaria===\n[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Equestrian statue of Charlemagne (Cornacchini)|Equestrian statue of Charlemagne]]'' by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]].]]\n\nBy 774, Charlemagne had invaded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Kingdom of Lombardy]], and he later annexed the Lombardian territories and assumed its crown, placing the [[Papal States]] under Frankish protection.<ref name=\"autogenerated30\">Historical Atlas of Knights and Castles, Cartographica, Dr Ian Barnes, 2007 pp.30&31</ref> The [[Duchy of Spoleto]] south of Rome was acquired in 774, while in the central western parts of Europe, the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was absorbed and the Bavarian policy continued of establishing tributary [[marches]], (borders protected in return for tribute or taxes) among the [[Slavs|Slavic]] Serbs and Czechs.

Charlemagne was preoccupied with other matters until 790 when he marched down the [[Danube]] and ravaged Avar territory to the [[Gy\u0151r]]. A Lombard army under Pippin then marched into the [[Drava]] valley and ravaged [[Pannonia]]. The campaigns ended when the Saxons revolted again in 792.\n\nFor the next two years, Charlemagne was occupied, along with the Slavs, against the Saxons. Pippin and Duke [[Eric of Friuli]] continued, however, to assault the Avars' ring-shaped strongholds. The great Ring of the Avars, their capital fortress, was taken twice. The booty was sent to Charlemagne at his capital, [[Aachen]], and redistributed to his followers and to foreign rulers, including King [[Offa of Mercia]]. Soon the Avar [[tudun]]s had lost the will to fight and travelled to Aachen to become vassals to Charlemagne and to become Christians. Charlemagne accepted their surrender and sent one native chief, baptised Abraham, back to Avaria with the ancient title of [[khagan]]. Abraham kept his people in line, but in 800, the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] under [[Krum|Khan Krum]] attacked the remains of the Avar state.\n\nIn 803, Charlemagne sent a Bavarian army into [[Pannonia]], defeating and bringing an end to the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar confederation]].<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite book|first1=Bernard S. |last1=Bachrach|author2=Clifford J.

The Slavs ultimately submitted, led by their leader Witzin. Charlemagne then accepted the surrender of the [[Veleti]] under Dragovit and demanded many hostages. He also demanded permission to send missionaries into this pagan region unmolested. The army marched to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] before turning around and marching to the Rhine, winning much booty with no harassment. The tributary Slavs became loyal allies. In 795, when the Saxons broke the peace, the Abotrites and Veleti rebelled with their new ruler against the Saxons. Witzin died in battle and Charlemagne avenged him by harrying the Eastphalians on the Elbe. Thrasuco, his successor, led his men to conquest over the Nordalbingians and handed their leaders over to Charlemagne, who honoured him. The Abotrites remained loyal until Charles' death and fought later against the Danes.\n\n===Southeast Slav expeditions===\n[[File:Europe around 800.gif|thumb|Europe around 800]]\n\nWhen Charlemagne incorporated much of Central Europe, he brought the Frankish state face to face with the Avars and Slavs in the southeast.<ref name=\"Bruce Ross\">{{cite journal | last=Bruce Ross | first=James | pages=212\u201335 | jstor=2854596 | title=Two Neglected Paladins of Charlemagne: Erich of Friuli and Gerold of Bavaria Speculum, Vol. 20, No. 2 | journal=Speculum | volume=20 | issue=2 |date = April 1945| doi=10.2307/2854596 }}</ref> The most southeast Frankish neighbours were [[Croats]], who settled in [[Duchy of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]] and [[Dalmatian Croatia]].

Einhard, ''Vita Karoli Magni'',&nbsp;28.</ref> but that debate obscured the more significant question of ''why'' the Pope granted the title and why Charlemagne accepted it.\n\n[[Roger Collins|Collins]] points out \"[t]hat the motivation behind the acceptance of the imperial title was a romantic and antiquarian interest in reviving the Roman empire is highly unlikely.\"{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=147}} For one thing, such romance would not have appealed either to Franks or Roman Catholics at the turn of the ninth century, both of whom viewed the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] heritage of the Roman Empire with distrust. The Franks took pride in having \"fought against and thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans\" and \"from the knowledge gained in baptism, clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of the holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire, by the sword and by wild animals\", as [[Pepin the Short|Pepin&nbsp;III]] described it in a law of 763 or 764.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}}\n\nFurthermore, the new title\u2014carrying with it the risk that the new emperor would \"make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of government\" or \"concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally\"\u2014risked alienating the Frankish leadership.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=149}}\n\nFor both the Pope and Charlemagne, the Roman Empire remained a significant power in European politics at this time. The [[Byzantine Empire]], based in [[Constantinople]], continued to hold a substantial portion of Italy, with borders not far south of Rome. Charles' sitting in judgment of the Pope could be seen as usurping the prerogatives of the Emperor in Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|By whom, however, could he [the Pope] be tried?

In normal circumstances the only conceivable answer to that question would have been the Emperor at Constantinople; but the imperial throne was at this moment occupied by [[Irene of Athens|Irene]]. That the Empress was notorious for having blinded and murdered her own son was, in the minds of both Leo and Charles, almost immaterial: it was enough that she was a woman. The female sex was known to be incapable of governing, and by the old Salic tradition was debarred from doing so. As far as Western Europe was concerned, the Throne of the Emperors was vacant: Irene's claim to it was merely an additional proof, if any were needed, of the degradation into which the so-called Roman Empire had fallen.|[[John Julius Norwich]]{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=378}}|}}\n\n[[File:Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (German - The Coronation of Charlemagne - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=|thumb|Coronation of Charlemagne, drawing by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nFor the Pope, then, there was \"no living Emperor at that time\"{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=379}} though [[Henri Pirenne]]{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=234n}} disputes this saying that the coronation \"was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople\". Nonetheless, the Pope took the extraordinary step of creating one. The papacy had since 727 been in conflict with Irene's predecessors in Constantinople over a number of issues, chiefly the continued Byzantine adherence to the doctrine of [[iconoclasm]], the destruction of Christian images; while from 750, the secular power of the Byzantine Empire in central Italy had been nullified.\n\n[[File:Couronnement d'un prince - Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve Lat1141 f2v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coronation of an idealised king, depicted in the Sacramentary of [[Charles the Bald]] (about 870)]]\n\nBy bestowing the Imperial crown upon Charlemagne, the Pope arrogated to himself \"the right to appoint&nbsp;... the Emperor of the Romans,&nbsp;... establishing the imperial crown as his own personal gift but simultaneously granting himself implicit superiority over the Emperor whom he had created.\" And \"because the Byzantines had proved so unsatisfactory from every point of view\u2014political, military and doctrinal\u2014he would select a westerner: the one man who by his wisdom and statesmanship and the vastness of his dominions&nbsp;... stood out head and shoulders above his contemporaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Popes: A History|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-0701182908|location=|pages=55}}</ref>\n\nWith Charlemagne's coronation, therefore, \"the Roman Empire remained, so far as either of them [Charlemagne and Leo] were concerned, one and indivisible, with Charles as its Emperor\", though there can have been \"little doubt that the coronation, with all that it implied, would be furiously contested in Constantinople\".{{sfn|Norwich|1992a|p=3}}\n\n[[Alcuin]] writes hopefully in his letters of an ''Imperium Christianum'' (\"Christian Empire\"), wherein, \"just as the inhabitants of the [Roman Empire] had been united by a common Roman citizenship\", presumably this new empire would be united by a common Christian faith.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}} This writes the view of Pirenne when he says \"Charles was the Emperor of the ''ecclesia'' as the Pope conceived it, of the Roman Church, regarded as the universal Church\".{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=233}} The ''Imperium Christianum'' was further supported at a number of [[synod]]s all across Europe by Paulinus of Aquileia.<ref name=\"Butler1995\">{{cite book |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XIEAD2MC1YkC|page=74}} |title=Butler's Lives of the Saints: New Full Edition |first=Alban |last=Butler |first2=David |last2=Hugh Farmer |chapter=St Paulinus of Aquileia, Bishop (c. 726\u2013804) |pages=74\u201375 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-86012-250-0}}</ref>\n\nWhat is known, from the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p= 153}} is that Charlemagne's reaction to his coronation was to take the initial steps towards securing the Constantinopolitan throne by sending envoys of marriage to Irene, and that Irene reacted somewhat favourably to them.\n\n[[File:Raphael Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|''[[The Coronation of Charlemagne]]'', by assistants of [[Raphael]], c. 1516\u20131517]]\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the universalist and localist conceptions of the empire, which remain controversial among historians. According to the former, the empire was a universal monarchy, a \"commonwealth of the whole world, whose sublime unity transcended every minor distinction\"; and the emperor \"was entitled to the obedience of Christendom\". According to the latter, the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion; his realm was limited in the same way as that of every other ruler, and when he made more far-reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of the Pope or of the Byzantine emperor. According to this view, also, the origin of the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than by overarching theories.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire |title=Holy Roman Empire |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ohnsorge, for a long time, it had been the custom of Byzantium to designate the German princes as spiritual \"sons\" of the Romans. What might have been acceptable in the fifth century had become provoking and insulting to the Franks in the eighth century. Charles came to believe that the Roman emperor, who claimed to head the world hierarchy of states, was, in reality, no greater than Charles himself, a king as other kings, since beginning in 629 he had entitled himself \"Basileus\" (translated literally as \"king\"). Ohnsorge finds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the inscription: \"Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum [Christ, protect Charles, king of the Franks], was used from 772 to 813, even during the imperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating that Charles felt himself to be just the king of the Franks. Finally, Ohnsorge points out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his only surviving son, Louis, as the emperor without recourse to Rome with only the acclamation of his Franks. The form in which this acclamation was offered was Frankish-Christian rather than Roman. This implies both independence from Rome and a Frankish (non-Roman) understanding of empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clc-library-org-docs.angelfire.com/charlemagne.html |title=Ohnsorge, Werner, ''Das Zweikaiserproblem im fr\u00fcheren Mittelalter.

When the family of Charles ceased to produce worthy heirs, the Pope gladly crowned whichever Italian magnate could best protect him from his local enemies.

The council was not recognised by Charlemagne since no Frankish emissaries had been invited, even though Charlemagne ruled more than three provinces of the classical Roman empire and was considered equal in rank to the Byzantine emperor. And while the Pope supported the reintroduction of the iconic veneration, he politically digressed from Byzantium.<ref name=Becher2011/> He certainly desired to increase the influence of the papacy, to honour his saviour Charlemagne, and to solve the constitutional issues then most troubling to European jurists in an era when Rome was not in the hands of an emperor. Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the imperial title was not a usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians. It was, however, seen as such in Byzantium, where it was protested by Irene and her successor [[Nikephoros I]]\u2014neither of whom had any great effect in enforcing their protests.\n\nThe East Romans, however, still held several territories in Italy: Venice (what was left of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]), [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] (in [[Calabria]]), [[Otranto]] (in [[Apulia]]), and [[Naples]] (the ''[[Ducatus Neapolitanus]]''). These regions remained outside of Frankish hands until 804, when the Venetians, torn by infighting, transferred their allegiance to the Iron Crown of Pippin, Charles' son. The ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'' ended. Nicephorus ravaged the coasts with a fleet, initiating the only instance of war between the Byzantines and the Franks. The conflict lasted until 810 when the pro-Byzantine party in Venice gave their city back to the Byzantine Emperor, and the two emperors of Europe made peace: Charlemagne received the [[Istria]]n peninsula and in 812 the emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] recognised his status as Emperor,<ref>''eum imperatorem et basileum appellantes'', cf.

The Danevirke protected Danish land and gave Godfred the opportunity to harass [[Frisia]] and [[Flanders]] with pirate raids. He also subdued the Frank-allied Veleti and fought the Abotrites.\n\nGodfred invaded Frisia, joked of visiting Aachen, but was murdered before he could do any more, either by a Frankish assassin or by one of his own men.

Pursuing his father's reforms, Charlemagne abolished the monetary system based on the gold {{lang|fr|[[solidus (coin)|sou]]}}. Instead, he and the [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon King]] [[Offa of Mercia]] took up Pippin's system for pragmatic reasons, notably a shortage of the metal.\n\nThe gold shortage was a direct consequence of the conclusion of peace with Byzantium, which resulted in ceding Venice and Sicily to the East and losing their trade routes to Africa. The resulting standardisation economically harmonised and unified the complex array of currencies that had been in use at the commencement of his reign, thus simplifying trade and commerce.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne denier Tours 793 to 812.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denier from the era of Charlemagne, [[Tours]], 793\u2013812]]\nCharlemagne established a new standard, the {{lang|fr|[[French livre|livre carolinienne]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|libra]]}}, the modern [[pound (currency)|pound]]), which was based upon a pound of silver\u2014a unit of both money and weight\u2014worth 20 sous (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]}} [which was primarily an accounting device and never actually minted], the modern [[shilling]]) or 240 {{lang|fr|[[denier (coin)|deniers]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[denarius]]}}, the modern [[penny]]). During this period, the {{lang|fr|livre}} and the {{lang|fr|sou}} were counting units; only the {{lang|fr|denier}} was a coin of the realm.\n\nCharlemagne instituted principles for [[accountancy|accounting practice]] by means of the [[Capitulare de villis]] of 802, which laid down strict rules for the way in which incomes and expenses were to be recorded.\n\nCharlemagne applied this system to much of the European continent, and Offa's standard was voluntarily adopted by much of England. After Charlemagne's death, continental coinage degraded, and most of Europe resorted to using the continued high-quality English coin until about 1100.\n\n===Jews in Charlemagne's realm===\nEarly in Charlemagne's rule he tacitly allowed Jews to monopolise money lending. At the time, lending of money for interest was proscribed in 814 because it violated Church law.

His reign is often referred to as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] because of the flowering of scholarship, literature, art and architecture that characterise it.

Joanna Story, (Manchester University Press, 2005), 195.</ref> and Lombard Italy) due to his vast conquests.

At the same time, at the urging of their king, scholars were producing more secular books on many subjects, including history, poetry, art, music, law, theology, etc. Due to the increased number of titles, private libraries flourished. These were mainly supported by aristocrats and churchmen who could afford to sustain them. At Charlemagne's court, a library was founded and a number of copies of books were produced, to be distributed by Charlemagne.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Charlemagne's court library revisited|journal=Early Medieval Europe|year=2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=339\u201363|doi=10.1111/j.0963-9462.2004.00141.x}}</ref><ref name=\"Anderson2013\" /> Book production was completed slowly by hand and took place mainly in large monastic libraries.

Indeed, the earliest manuscripts available for many ancient texts are Carolingian.

The deepening of the spiritual life was later to be seen as central to public policy and royal governance.

Louis received Aquitaine, the Spanish March and [[Provence]]. The imperial title was not mentioned, which led to the suggestion that, at that particular time, Charlemagne regarded the title as an honorary achievement that held no hereditary significance.\n\nPepin died in 810 and Charles in 811. Charlemagne then reconsidered the matter, and in 813, crowned his youngest son, Louis, co-emperor and co-King of the Franks, granting him a half-share of the empire and the rest upon Charlemagne's own death. The only part of the Empire that Louis was not promised was Italy, which Charlemagne specifically bestowed upon Pippin's illegitimate son [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LUCPcwybApIC&pg=PA10&dq=Bernard+of+Italy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4mIyl-5PXAhVCOyYKHUBcD6oQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=Bernard%20of%20Italy&f=false Noble, Thomas F.
