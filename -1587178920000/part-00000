The company operated bus and coach services in [[Derbyshire]] between 1921 and 2012.\n\n==History==\nThe company's founder Norman Frost bought a [[Crossley Motors|Crossley]] lorry from the War Department in 1921. A second Crossley with charabanc bodywork was purchased the following year. A Dickens bus body was fitted to the chassis of the original vehicle in 1924. Felix settled down to operate the [[Derby]] to [[Ilkeston]] via [[Chaddesden]], [[Stanley, Derbyshire|Stanley]] and [[West Hallam]] route which remained their core service until the sale of operations. At about this time, Frost was asked to name one of his vehicles. He made his choice using a popular song of the day, \"Felix Kept on Walking\" as inspiration.\n\nThe vehicles were originally based on New Street in Stanley, where Frost's parents lived. In 1937, a house and garage were built on Station Road, which was the base of the firm until its final demise.\n\nNorman Frost owned the company until his death in 1975. It then passed to his nephew, Geoffrey Middup. It was at this point that a limited company was formed.\n\nIn early 2009, \"Felix the Cat Creations Inc.\", a large United States company, approached Felix and claimed it owned copyright for images of cats used next to the Felix name. While it provided no evidence, Felix decided they couldn't afford to fight any court case, so as a result all cat images were removed from every aspect of the company.<ref name=\"CatLegalActionThreat\">{{cite journal|last=Millar |first=Alan |date=March 2009 |title=US lawyers chase cat off Felix fleet |journal=[[Buses Magazine]] |issue=648 |pages=14 }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2011 it was announced that the bus operations (Black Cat, (Ilkeston Hospital-Ilkeston-West Hallam-Stanley-Chaddesden-Derby) and the Ilkeston Flyer (Ilkeston-Derby, limited stop)) would be sold to [[Wellglade Group#Midland General|Midland General]], a subsidiary of the [[Wellglade Group]], who also operated a Black Cat between Ilkeston and Derby, and the other two Ilkeston Flyer departures each hour. This transfer took place on 29 January 2012, the bus services then operating from [[Trentbarton]]'s Meadow Road garage in Derby, as a separate unit.\n\nThe coach holidays and day excursions are now operated under the Felix name by Swiftsure Coaches of [[Burton-on-Trent]].\n\nFelix continued to operate some school journeys into [[Kirk Hallam]] until the end of March 2012, when subsidies were withdrawn by [[Derbyshire County Council]]. The operators licence expired at the end of April 2012, it was not renewed and operations from Stanley came to an end.\n\n==Fleet==\n[[File:Plaxton Derwent 3000 1.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Plaxton Derwent 3000|Plaxton Derwent]] bodied [[Leyland Tiger]] at [[Derby bus station]]]]\nBetween 1926 and 1940 [[Dennis Specialist Vehicles|Dennis]] chassis were purchased, many having bodywork by [[Willowbrook (vehicle body builders)|Willowbrook]] of [[Loughborough]].\n\nAfter experience of utility [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] OWB buses during [[World War II]], Felix standardised on Bedford chassis from the 1950s to the 1980s. The fleet was 100% Bedford between 1968 and 1985. During this period the fleet size remained fairly constant at around seven or eight vehicles. [[Plaxton]] bodywork was favoured, and most vehicles were coaches along with a few vehicles to dual-purpose specification.\n\nAfter [[Bus deregulation in Great Britain|bus deregulation]] in 1986, the fleet increased gradually to around twice its previous size, peaking at 17 vehicles in 2002, reducing to 16 in 2005, and effectively being 15 from February 2007 due to an engine problem with a 1988 [[Leyland Lynx]]. The cessation of service 59 (see below) saw further fleet reductions, and by mid-2008, the fleet numbered 13. The diversity of the fleet also increased with new and secondhand [[Leyland Motors|Leylands]], [[Dennis Specialist Vehicles|Dennises]] and [[Volvo Buses|Volvos]], and more recently still, [[Scania 4-series (bus)#Scania L94|Scania L94s]], [[Optare Solo]]s and [[VDL SB200]]s joining the fleet. The emphasis has also switched from coaches to service buses. The final fleet contained three coaches, two [[Iveco Bus|Irisbuses]] and a Volvo, and 90% of the service buses were [[low-floor]], easy access types.\n\n==Services==\nThe main service was latterly operated jointly with [[Trentbarton]] as \"The Black Cat\" having previously been numbered 12. The Ilkeston terminus of the service was the market place; however, in 1986, this was pedestrianised, so the service was extended to the Shipley View estate, and a year later to the Ilkeston Community Hospital.\n\nAlso operated jointly with Trentbarton was an express service between Derby and Ilkeston via [[Kirk Hallam]] and [[Spondon]] named \"The Ilkeston Flyer\".\n\nA third service between Derby and Ilkeston, via [[Breadsall]] and Stanley Common, was operated on behalf of [[Derbyshire County Council]], numbered 59, but the retendering process operated by the council saw the contract awarded to K & H Doyle of Alfreton; the last day of Felix 59 operation was 27 October 2007.\n\nThe company operated school services from surrounding villages into Kirk Hallam and, on weekdays, a single morning service from the Rose and Crown in Smalley to Ilkeston via Mapperley which was referred to on some timetables as route number 13 and others as 007.\n\nA football special was also run from Ilkeston to the [[Pride Park Stadium]] on match days. Felix had been transporting supporters to [[Derby County F. C.|Derby County]] home games almost as long as they had operated buses; an early vehicle order form showed three lines on the destination blind, \"Derby\", \"Ilkeston\" and \"Baseball Ground\", the latter being the old home of Derby County.\n\nDay excursions were run for many years, and the company operated two programmes, one picking up along the Black Cat route but also including Stanley Common and one starting at Shipley (between Ilkeston and Heanor) and then picking up between [[Langley Mill]] and [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]].\n\nIn the 1980s, Felix started to operate holiday tours, both in the UK and abroad. Due to falling numbers of passengers, the holiday tours were to be stopped, but popular demand saw a limited number operate in 2008.\n\n==Livery==\nInitially, vehicles were painted chocolate brown and cream. By 1950, the livery was red and maroon with gold fleetnames and black ''[[Felix the Cat]]'' cartoon emblems. In the mid-1990s, in common with many operators, Felix coaches (not buses) appeared in white with vinyl relief patterns. The final vehicle to carry the red and maroon livery, [[Leyland Lynx]] J564 URW, suffered engine failure in February 2010 and was withdrawn.\n\nService buses were latterly painted red and white, and coaches red. Some buses carried branded livery for the \"Black Cat\" and one carried a blue livery for the \"Ilkeston Flyer\" service; this vehicle also carried a [[Trentbarton]] bow logo.\n\nAfter being contacted by Felix The Cat Creations Inc. a 2-year licence to use the cartoon Felix The Cat character was purchased, which expired in July 2007. During this time, Felix Bus Services introduced a redesigned cat image, which appeared on vehicles purchased between 2006 and 2008; Volvo/Plaxton coach W709 PTO had its existing Felix The Cat images altered.

The company operated bus and coach services in [[Derbyshire]] between 1921 and 2012.\n\n==History==\nThe company's founder Norman Frost bought a [[Crossley Motors|Crossley]] lorry from the War Department in 1921. A second Crossley with charabanc bodywork was purchased the following year. A Dickens bus body was fitted to the chassis of the original vehicle in 1924. Felix settled down to operate the [[Derby]] to [[Ilkeston]] via [[Chaddesden]], [[Stanley, Derbyshire|Stanley]] and [[West Hallam]] route which remained their core service until the sale of operations. At about this time, Frost was asked to name one of his vehicles. He made his choice using a popular song of the day, \"Felix Kept on Walking\" as inspiration.\n\nThe vehicles were originally based on New Street in Stanley, where Frost's parents lived. In 1937, a house and garage were built on Station Road, which was the base of the firm until its final demise.\n\nNorman Frost owned the company until his death in 1975. It then passed to his nephew, Geoffrey Middup. It was at this point that a limited company was formed.\n\nIn early 2009, \"Felix the Cat Creations Inc.\", a large United States company, approached Felix and claimed it owned copyright for images of cats used next to the Felix name. While it provided no evidence, Felix decided they couldn't afford to fight any court case, so as a result all cat images were removed from every aspect of the company.<ref name=\"CatLegalActionThreat\">{{cite journal|last=Millar |first=Alan |date=March 2009 |title=US lawyers chase cat off Felix fleet |journal=[[Buses Magazine]] |issue=648 |pages=14 }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2011 it was announced that the bus operations (Black Cat, (Ilkeston Hospital-Ilkeston-West Hallam-Stanley-Chaddesden-Derby) and the Ilkeston Flyer (Ilkeston-Derby, limited stop)) would be sold to [[Wellglade Group#Midland General|Midland General]], a subsidiary of the [[Wellglade Group]], who also operated a Black Cat between Ilkeston and Derby, and the other two Ilkeston Flyer departures each hour. This transfer took place on 29 January 2012, the bus services then operating from [[Trentbarton]]'s Meadow Road garage in Derby, as a separate unit.\n\nThe coach holidays and day excursions are now operated under the Felix name by Swiftsure Coaches of [[Burton-on-Trent]].\n\nFelix continued to operate some school journeys into [[Kirk Hallam]] until the end of March 2012, when subsidies were withdrawn by [[Derbyshire County Council]]. The operators licence expired at the end of April 2012, it was not renewed and operations from Stanley came to an end.\n\n==Fleet==\n[[File:Plaxton Derwent 3000 1.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Plaxton Derwent 3000|Plaxton Derwent]] bodied [[Leyland Tiger]] at [[Derby bus station]]]]\nBetween 1926 and 1940 [[Dennis Specialist Vehicles|Dennis]] chassis were purchased, many having bodywork by [[Willowbrook (vehicle body builders)|Willowbrook]] of [[Loughborough]].\n\nAfter experience of utility [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] OWB buses during [[World War II]], Felix standardised on Bedford chassis from the 1950s to the 1980s. The fleet was 100% Bedford between 1968 and 1985. During this period the fleet size remained fairly constant at around seven or eight vehicles. [[Plaxton]] bodywork was favoured, and most vehicles were coaches along with a few vehicles to dual-purpose specification.\n\nAfter [[Bus deregulation in Great Britain|bus deregulation]] in 1986, the fleet increased gradually to around twice its previous size, peaking at 17 vehicles in 2002, reducing to 16 in 2005, and effectively being 15 from February 2007 due to an engine problem with a 1988 [[Leyland Lynx]]. The cessation of service 59 (see below) saw further fleet reductions, and by mid-2008, the fleet numbered 13. The diversity of the fleet also increased with new and secondhand [[Leyland Motors|Leylands]], [[Dennis Specialist Vehicles|Dennises]] and [[Volvo Buses|Volvos]], and more recently still, [[Scania 4-series (bus)#Scania L94|Scania L94s]], [[Optare Solo]]s and [[VDL SB200]]s joining the fleet. The emphasis has also switched from coaches to service buses. The final fleet contained three coaches, two [[Iveco Bus|Irisbuses]] and a Volvo, and 90% of the service buses were [[low-floor]], easy access types.\n\n==Services==\nThe main service was latterly operated jointly with [[Trentbarton]] as \"The Black Cat\" having previously been numbered 12. The Ilkeston terminus of the service was the market place; however, in 1986, this was pedestrianised, so the service was extended to the Shipley View estate, and a year later to the Ilkeston Community Hospital.\n\nAlso operated jointly with Trentbarton was an express service between Derby and Ilkeston via [[Kirk Hallam]] and [[Spondon]] named \"The Ilkeston Flyer\".\n\nA third service between Derby and Ilkeston, via [[Breadsall]] and Stanley Common, was operated on behalf of [[Derbyshire County Council]], numbered 59, but the retendering process operated by the council saw the contract awarded to K & H Doyle of Alfreton; the last day of Felix 59 operation was 27 October 2007.\n\nThe company operated school services from surrounding villages into Kirk Hallam and, on weekdays, a single morning service from the Rose and Crown in Smalley to Ilkeston via Mapperley which was referred to on some timetables as route number 13 and others as 007.\n\nA football special was also run from Ilkeston to the [[Pride Park Stadium]] on match days. Felix had been transporting supporters to [[Derby County F. C.|Derby County]] home games almost as long as they had operated buses; an early vehicle order form showed three lines on the destination blind, \"Derby\", \"Ilkeston\" and \"Baseball Ground\", the latter being the old home of Derby County.\n\nDay excursions were run for many years, and the company operated two programmes, one picking up along the Black Cat route but also including Stanley Common and one starting at Shipley (between Ilkeston and Heanor) and then picking up between [[Langley Mill]] and [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]].\n\nIn the 1980s, Felix started to operate holiday tours, both in the UK and abroad. Due to falling numbers of passengers, the holiday tours were to be stopped, but popular demand saw a limited number operate in 2008.\n\n==Livery==\nInitially, vehicles were painted chocolate brown and cream. By 1950, the livery was red and maroon with gold fleetnames and black ''[[Felix the Cat]]'' cartoon emblems. In the mid-1990s, in common with many operators, Felix coaches (not buses) appeared in white with vinyl relief patterns. The final vehicle to carry the red and maroon livery, [[Leyland Lynx]] J564 URW, suffered engine failure in February 2010 and was withdrawn.\n\nService buses were latterly painted red and white, and coaches red. Some buses carried branded livery for the \"Black Cat\" and one carried a blue livery for the \"Ilkeston Flyer\" service; this vehicle also carried a [[Trentbarton]] bow logo.\n\nAfter being contacted by Felix The Cat Creations Inc. a 2-year licence to use the cartoon Felix The Cat character was purchased, which expired in July 2007. During this time, Felix Bus Services introduced a redesigned cat image, which appeared on vehicles purchased between 2006 and 2008; Volvo/Plaxton coach W709 PTO had its existing Felix The Cat images altered. However, Felix The Cat Creations Inc. asserted that they owned the rights to any feline image used with the name Felix. This caused the company to remove cat images from all of the fleet.<ref name=\"Marchingorders\">{{cite journal |date=February 2009 |title=Felix gets his marching orders |journal=this is Derbyshire |url=http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Felix-gets-marching-orders/story-11632132-detail/story.html |accessdate=2 November 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*''Felix Bus Services Limited of Stanley, Derbyshire'' by Paul D.

They attended [[Holy Mass|Mass]] daily, prayed the [[Rosary]] nightly, and abstained from meat three days a week in honor of [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]].<ref name=\"ewtn1\"/> Although Francesco's parents and grandparents were illiterate, they narrated Bible stories to their children.\n\nAccording to the diary of Father Agostino da San Marco (who was later his spiritual director in [[San Marco in Lamis]]) the young Francesco was afflicted with a number of illnesses. At six he suffered from severe [[gastroenteritis]]. At ten he caught [[typhoid fever]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n[[File:KOS O PIO.jpg|thumb|left|The conventual cell of Padre Pio]]\nAs a youth, Francesco reported that he had experienced heavenly [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]s and [[Religious ecstasy|ecstasies]].<ref name=\"Ruffin\"/> In 1897, after he had completed three years at the public school, Francesco was said to have been drawn to the life of a friar after listening to a young [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] who was in the countryside seeking donations. When Francesco expressed his desire to his parents, they made a trip to [[Morcone]], a community {{convert|13|mi|km}} north of Pietrelcina, to find out if their son was eligible to enter the Order. The friars there informed them that they were interested in accepting Francesco into their community, but he needed to be better educated.<ref name=\"ewtn1\"/>\n\nFrancesco's father went to the [[United States]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1147|title=Saints|publisher=The American Catholic|accessdate=}}</ref> in search of work to pay for private tutoring for his son, to meet the academic requirements to enter the Capuchin Order.<ref name=\"Ruffin\"/> It was in this period that Francesco received the [[sacrament]] of [[Confirmation]] on 27 September 1899. He underwent private tutoring and passed the stipulated academic requirements. On 6 January 1903, at the age of 15, he entered the [[novitiate]] of the Capuchin friars at Morcone. On 22 January, he took the [[Franciscan]] [[religious habit|habit]] and the name of Fra ([[Friar]]) Pio, in honor of [[Pope Pius I]], whose [[relic]] is preserved in the Santa Anna Chapel in Pietrelcina.<ref name=\"ewtn1\"/><ref name=santanna>{{cite web|last1=Convento Pietralcina|title=La chiesetta di Sant'Anna|url=http://www.cappuccinipietrelcina.com/la-chiesetta-di-santanna/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140805154534/http://www.cappuccinipietrelcina.com/la-chiesetta-di-santanna/|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 August 2014|website=cappuccinipietrelcina.com|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref> He took the [[simple vow]]s of [[poverty, chastity and obedience]].<ref name=\"Ruffin\"/>\n\n===Priesthood===\n[[File:PIC 023.jpg|thumb|right|The church-shrine in [[San Giovanni Rotondo]], Padre Pio's own church]]\n[[File:S.Giovanni Rotondo (3)-2.jpg|thumb|right|The altar of Padre Pio's church in [[San Giovanni Rotondo]], [[Italy]]]]\n[[File:Chiesa di Santa Maria delle Grazie, interno (San Giovanni Rotondo).JPG|thumb|right|Interior of Padre Pio's church in [[San Giovanni Rotondo]], [[Italy]]]]\n\nCommencing his seven-year study for the priesthood, Fra Pio travelled to the friary of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] in [[Umbria]].<ref name=\"ewtn1\"/> At 17, he fell ill, complaining of loss of appetite, insomnia, exhaustion, fainting spells, and [[migraines]]. He vomited frequently and could digest only milk and cheese. Religious devotees point to this time that inexplicable phenomena allegedly began to occur. During prayers for example, Pio appeared to others to be in a stupor, as if he were absent. One of Pio's fellow friars later claimed to have seen him in [[religious ecstasy|\necstasy]], and allegedly [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitating]] above the ground.<ref>Renzo Allegri, ''I miracoli di Padre Pio'' p. 21.</ref>\n\nIn June 1905, Pio's health worsened to such an extent that his superiors decided to send him to a mountain convent, in the hope that the change of air would do him good. This had little impact, however, and doctors advised that he return home. Even there his health failed to improve. Despite this, On 27 January 1907, he still made his solemn [[Profession (religious)|profession]].\n\nIn 1910, Pio was subsequently [[ordination|ordained]] a priest by [[Archbishop]] Paolo Schinosi at the Cathedral of [[Benevento]]. Four days later, he offered his first Mass at the parish church of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady of the Angels]]. His health being precarious, he was permitted to remain with his family until 1916 while still retaining the Capuchin habit.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20020616_padre-pio_en.html \"Padre Pio da Pietrelcina\", Vatican News Service]</ref>\n\nOn 4 September 1916, however, Pio was ordered to return to his community life. He moved to an agricultural community, [[Our Lady of Grace]] Capuchin [[Monastery|Friary]], located in the Gargano Mountains in [[San Giovanni Rotondo]] in the [[Province of Foggia]]. At that time the community numbered seven friars. He went on to remain at San Giovanni Rotondo until his death in 1968, except for a period of military service. In the priesthood, Padre Pio was known to perform a number of successful conversions to Catholicism.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=3ApWCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT128&lpg=PT128&dq=padre+pio+mason+confession#v=onepage&q=%20mason%20&f=false | title=Padre Pio: The Stigmatist| isbn=9781618902634| last1=Charles Mortimer Carty| first1=Rev.

His advice on the practical application of theology he often summed up in his now famous quote, \"Pray, Hope and Don\u2019t Worry\". He directed Christians to recognize God in all things and to desire above all things to do the will of God.<ref name=\"ewtn2\"/>\n\nMany people who heard of him traveled to [[San Giovanni Rotondo]] to meet him and confess to him, ask for help, or have their curiosity satisfied. Pio's mother died at the village around the convent in 1928. Later, in 1938, Pio had his elderly father Grazio live with him. His brother Michele also moved in. Pio's father lived in a little house outside the convent, until his death in 1946.<ref>{{cite book|author =Ylva-Kristina Sj\u00f6blom|title=Padre Pio|publisher=Catholica|pages=10, 85}}</ref>\n\n===First World War and aftermath===\n\nWhen [[World War I]] started, four friars from this community were selected for military service in the Italian army. At that time, Padre Pio was a teacher at the seminary and a spiritual director. When one more friar was called into service, Pio was put in charge of the community. On 15 November 1915, he was drafted and on December 6, assigned to the 10th Medical Corps in [[Naples]]. Due to poor health, he was continually discharged and recalled until on 16 March 1918, he was declared unfit for service and discharged completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.padrepiodevotions.org/chronology.asp|title=Chronology|website=Padre Pio Devotions}}</ref>\n\nPeople who had started rebuilding their lives after the war began to see in Padre Pio a symbol of hope.<ref name=\"ewtn2\"/> Those close to him attest that he began to manifest several spiritual gifts, including the gifts of healing, [[bilocation]], levitation, [[prophecy]], [[miracle]]s, extraordinary abstinence from both sleep and nourishment (one account states that Padre Agostino recorded one instance in which Padre Pio was able to subsist for at least 20 days at Verafeno on only communion wafers without any other nourishment), the ability to read hearts, the gift of [[Glossolalia|tongues]], the gift of conversions, and pleasant-smelling wounds.<ref name = \"garabandal\">{{Cite web |last=Pelletier |first=Joseph A |title=Padre Pio, Mary, and the Rosary |website=Garabandal |url=http://www.garabandal.us/padre-pio-mary-and-the-rosary-rev-joseph-pelletier-aa |accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref>\n\nPadre Pio increasingly became well known among the wider populace.

In his report, Bishop Rossi wrote that Padre Pio \u201cheld his head high and was serene, his look lively and sweet, his words gleamed with kindness and sincerity.\u201d\n\nThe task that began on June 14 of that year lasted for eight days, during which Bishop Rossi observed Padre Pio in detail. He wrote that he was very gentle with his brothers, beloved by his superiors for being a \u201cgreat example and not a gossiper.\u201d\u00a0 He spent 10-12 hours a day in the confessional and he celebrated the Mass with \u201cextraordinary devotion.\u201d\n\n=== Amico Bignami, medical examination from 1919 ===\nThe pathologist Amico Bignami conducted a medical examination of Father Pio's wounds in 1919 and concluded that it was a skin necrosis that was hindered from healing by chemicals such as iodine tincture.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (ref. 2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age. P. 39.</ref>\n\n=== Giorgio Festa, medical examinations 1919 and 1920 ===\nFesta was a physician and examined Pio in 1919 and 1920.

He came to the conclusion that Francesco Forgione was a man of \"restricted field of knowledge, low psychic energy, monotonous ideas, little volition.\" <ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age. P. 59.</ref> Gemelli critically judged Pio: \"The case is one of suggestion unconsciously planted by Father Benedetto in the weak mind of Padre Pio, producing those characteristic manifestations of [[psittacism]] that are intrinsic to the hysteric mind.\"<ref>\" \"Sergio Luzzatto (2011) Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age. P. 59.</ref>\n\nOn behalf of the Holy Office, Gemelli re-examined Father Pio in 1925, writing a report in April 1926. This time he let Pio show him the wounds. Gemelli saw as its cause the use of a corrosive substance. Pio had attached himself to these wounds. The Jesuit Festa had previously tried to question Gemelli's comments on stigmata in general.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 140.</ref> Gemelli responded to this criticism in his report and resorted to responding to his knowledge of self-inflicted wounds. He therefore clarified his statements about the nature of Pio's wounds: \"Anyone with experience in forensic medicine, and above all in variety by sores and wounds that self-destructive soldiers were presented during the war, can have no doubt that these were wounds of erosion caused by the use of a caustic substance. The base of the sore and its shape are in every way similar to the sores observed in soldiers who procured them with chemical means.\"<ref>In: Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 140.</ref>\n\nOnce again, Gemelli judged Father Pio's mental abilities as limited: \"He [Pio] is the ideal partner with whom former Minister Provincial Father Benedetto is able to create an incubus-succubus pair ... He is a good priest: calm, quiet, meek, more because of the mental deficiency than out of virtue. A poor soul, able to repeat a few stereotypical religious phrases, a poor, sick man who has learned his lesson from his master, Father Benedetto.\"<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 141.</ref> Gemelli wrote in 1940 and later several times to the Holy Office on what he considers to be unjustified claims to the sanctity of Father Pio.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in Secular Age, p. 259.</ref>\n\n=== Raffaele Rossi, First Apostolic Visitation of 1921 ===\nThe Bishop of Volterra, [[Raffaele Carlo Rossi|Raffaele Rossi]], [[Discalced Carmelite|Carmelite]], was formally commissioned on June 11, 1921 by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]] to make a canonical inquiry concerning Father Pio. Rossi began his [[Canonical visitation|Apostolic Visitation]] on June 14 in San Giovanni Rotondo with the interrogation of witnesses, two [[diocesan priests]] and seven [[friars]]. After eight days of investigation, he finally completed a benevolent report, which he sent to the Holy Office on October 4, 1921, the feast of St. Francis of Assisi. The extensive and detailed report essentially stated the following: Father Pio, of whom Rossi had a favorable impression, was a good religious and the San Giovanni Rotondo convent was a good community. Whatever is extraordinary about what Father Pio does that can not be explained, but certainly not by the intervention of the devil, or by deception or dizziness. Public exuberance has declined sharply.<ref>Francesco Castelli, '' Padre Pio Under Investigation - The secret Vatican files '', Ignatius Press, 2011, p. 20, p. 28, p. 67</ref><ref>https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/details_of_first_investigation_into_padre_pios_stigmata_revealed</ref> During the interviews with the witnesses, which Rossi undertook a total of three times, he let himself be shown the stigmata of the then 34-year-old Father Pio.

At the beginning of his tenure, he learned that Father Pio's opponents had placed listening devices in his monastery cell and confessional, recording his confessions with tape.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age , P. 270.</ref> In a semi-official journal note, John XXIII wrote that he prayed for \"PP\" (Padre Pio). The tape recordings made it clear that he had \"intimate and indecent relationships with women from his impenetrable praetorian guard around his person\".<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 270.</ref>\nJohn XXIII had probably never listened to the tapes himself, but assumed the correctness of this view.<ref name=\"Sergio Luzzatto 2011 p. 271\">Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 271.</ref> According to Luzzatto, the Vatican had not ordered this wiretap. In another journal note, John XXIII wrote that he wanted to take action. In fact, he ordered another Apostolic Visitation.<ref name=\"Sergio Luzzatto 2011 p. 271\"/>\n\n=== Carlo Maccari, Second Apostolic Visitation of 1960 ===\nFather Carlo Maccari was Secretary-General of the Diocese of Rome and met Pio nine times altogether.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 272.</ref> Pio was very suspicious of Maccari, who wrote in his diary: \"Reticence, narrowness of mind, lies - these are the weapons he uses to evade my questions ... Overall impression: pitiful.\"<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 273.</ref> Maccari demanded Father Pio's omission to practice kisses after the confession for the lay sisters. In his report, Maccari noted that Pio had inadequate religious education. He works a lot for a man of his age. He is not an ascetic and has many connections to the outside world. In general, there is too much mixing of the \"sacred\" and the \"all too human\".<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 274.</ref> Maccari noted in his report by name, which woman stated at what time to have been the lover of Pio - without clearly assessing whether all these statements were true.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age , p. 274.</ref> Maccari focused on assessing the fanaticism of Pio's social environment, describing it as \"religious conceptions that oscillate between superstition and magic.\"<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 275.</ref> Maccari called Pio's supporters \"a vast and dangerous organization.\"<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age , p. 276.</ref> Pio never had his own supporters advised to moderation.

The brothers of Santa Maria delle Grazie should gradually be relocated, a new abbot should come from outside the region. No one should be allowed to confess to Pio more than once a month. The hospital was to be given new statutory statutes to sever the responsibilities of the medical and spiritual \"healing\" capuchins.<ref name=\"Sergio Luzzatto 2011 p. 277\"/>\nFollowing Maccari's Apostolic Visitation, John XXIII noted in his diary that he sees Father Pio as a \"straw idol\" (''idolo di stoppa'').<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 278.</ref>\n\n[[File:KOS San Giovanni Rotondo.jpg|thumb|The Hospital that was built on Padre Pio's initiative in [[San Giovanni Rotondo]], [[Italy]].

The Vatican was initially skeptical.\n\n===Stigmata===\nBased on Pio's correspondence, even early in his priesthood he experienced less obvious indications of the visible [[stigmata]]: bodily marks, pain, and bleeding in locations supposedly corresponding to the [[crucifixion]] wounds of [[Jesus Christ]].<ref name=\"stigmata\">{{cite book|last = McGregor, O.C.S.O| first = Augustine| author2 = Fr.

In the middle of the palms of my hands a red mark appeared, about the size of a penny, accompanied by acute pain in the middle of the red marks. The pain was more pronounced in the middle of the left hand, so much so that I can still feel it. Also under my feet I can feel some pain.<ref name=\"stigmata\"/></blockquote>\n\nAlready in a letter dated March 21, 1912, to his spiritual companion and confessor, Father Agostino, Father Pio wrote of his devotion to the mystical body of Christ and the intuition that he, Pio, one day himself would bear the stigmata of Christ. Luzzatto points out that in this letter Father Pio uses unrecognized passages from a book by the stigmatized mystic [[Gemma Galgani]]. Later Pio denied knowing or owning the cited book.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011):  Padre Pio: ''Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age'', p. 19.</ref>\n\nHis close friend Padre Agostino wrote in 1915, asking specific questions, such as when he first experienced visions, whether he had been granted the stigmata, and whether he felt the pains of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], namely the crowning of thorns and the scourging. Pio replied that he had been favoured with visions since his novitiate period (1903 to 1904). Although he had been granted the stigmata, he had been so terrified by the phenomenon he begged the Lord to withdraw them. He wrote that he did not wish the pain to be removed, only the visible wounds, since he considered them to be an indescribable and almost unbearable humiliation.<ref name=\"stigmata\"/>\n\nOn 20 September 1918, while hearing confessions, Pio claimed to have had a reappearance of the physical occurrence of the stigmata.  The phenomenon was reported to have continued for fifty years, until the end of his life. The blood flowing from the stigmata purportedly smelled of perfume or flowers.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} He reported to Agostino that the pain remained and was more acute on specific days and under certain circumstances. He also said that he was suffering the pain of the crown of thorns and the scourging. He did not define the frequency of these occurrences but said that he had been suffering from them at least once weekly for some years.<ref name=\"stigmata\"/> Though Pio said he would have preferred to suffer in secret, by early 1919, news had begun to spread. Pio often wore red mittens or black coverings on his hands and feet as he was embarrassed by the marks.<ref name=\"time2\"/> However, no visible scarring was present at the time of Pio's death.<ref>{{cite web|date=2006-05-12|url=http://www.padrepio.com/his-life| title =Padre Pio's Cell| website =Padre Pio Foundation| accessdate = 2006-05-12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Padre-Pio-young.jpg|thumb|left|Padre Pio showing the [[stigmata]] (detail from a photo from August 19, 1919) <ref>Complete illustration of the photograph by [[Urte Krass]]: ''Kontrollierter Gesichtsverlust.

[...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation<ref name=\"cantius\">{{Cite web| title = First class relic of St. Padre Pio of Pietrelcina at St. John Cantius Church| url = http://www.cantius.org/go/organizations/relic_of_st_padre_pio_of_pietrelcina| accessdate = 2008-01-19| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>....the pain was so intense that I began to feel as if I were dying on the cross.<ref>Fortin, Fr.

On 27 July of the same year, Padre Pio offered himself as a victim for the end of the war. Days passed and between 5 and 7 August, Padre Pio had a vision in which Christ appeared and pierced his side.<ref name = \"gerhold\"/><ref name=\"ewtn2\"/>\n\nAs a result, Padre Pio claimed to have received a physical wound in his side. This occurrence is considered as a [[transverberation]] or \"piercing of the heart\", indicating the union of love with God within Christian mysticism. \n[[File:3rd class relic PIO.jpg|thumb|Many books about Padre Pio included a [[Relic|third-class relic]] (cloth) on a prayer card.

One of his Capuchin brothers said this of his state during that period:\n\n<blockquote>During this time his entire appearance looked altered as if he had died. He was constantly weeping and sighing, saying that God had forsaken him.<ref name = \"gerhold\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn a letter from Padre Pio to Padre Benedetto, dated 21 August 1918, Padre Pio writes of his experiences during the transverberation:\n\n<blockquote>While I was hearing the boys\u2019 confessions on the evening of the 5th [August] I was suddenly terrorized by the sight of a celestial person who presented himself to my mind\u2019s eye. He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed steel blade which seemed to emit fire. At the very instant that I saw all this, I saw that person hurl the weapon into my soul with all his might. I cried out with difficulty and felt I was dying. I asked the boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot tell you how much I suffered during this period of anguish. Even my entrails were torn and ruptured by the weapon, and nothing was spared. From that day on I have been mortally wounded. I feel in the depths of my soul a wound that is always open and which causes me continual agony.<ref name=\"cantius\"/></blockquote>\n\nOn 20 September 1918, accounts state that the pains of the transverberation had ceased and Pio was in \"profound peace.\"<ref name = \"gerhold\"/> On that day, as he was engaged in prayer in the choir loft in the Church of Our Lady of Grace, he received another celestial vision which led to [[religious ecstasy]]. When the ecstasy ended, Pio claimed to have received the visible stigmata, the five wounds of Christ. This time, the stigmata were permanent. They stayed visible for the next fifty years of his life.<ref name=\"ewtn2\"/>\n\n===Prophecy===\n\nIn 1947, Father Karol J\u00f3zef Wojty\u0142a (later [[Pope John Paul II]]) visited Padre Pio, who heard his confession.

His health deteriorated in the 1960s but he continued his spiritual works. On 21 September 1968, the day after the 50th anniversary of his receiving the stigmata, Padre Pio felt great fatigue.<ref name=\"PioProfile\"/>  The next day, on September 22, 1968, he was supposed to offer a [[Solemn Mass]], but feeling weak, he asked his superior if he might say a [[Low Mass]] instead, as he had done daily for years. Due to the large number of pilgrims present for the Mass, Padre Pio's superior decided the Solemn Mass must proceed. Padre Pio carried out his duties but appeared extremely weak and fragile. His voice was weak and, after the Mass had concluded, he nearly collapsed while walking down the altar steps. He needed help from his Capuchin brothers. This was his last celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].\n\nEarly in the morning of 23 September 1968, Pio made his last [[Sacrament of Reconciliation|confession]] and renewed his Franciscan vows.<ref name=\"ewtn2\"/> As was customary, he had his [[rosary]] in his hands, though he did not have the strength to say the [[Hail Mary]]s aloud.

The investigation continued for seven years. In 1990 Pio was declared a [[Servant of God]], the first step in the process of canonization. The investigation, however, did not lead to any public factual clearance by the Church on his previous 'excommunication' or on the allegations that his stigmata were not of a supernatural kind. Moreover, Pio's stigmata were remarkably left out of the obligatory investigations for the canonization process, in order to avoid obstacles prohibiting a successful closure.\n\nBeginning in 1990, the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] debated how Padre Pio had lived his life, and in 1997 Pope John Paul II declared him [[venerable]]. A discussion of the effects of his life on others followed. Cases were studied such as a reported cure of an Italian woman, Consiglia de Martino, associated with Padre Pio's [[intercession]]. In 1999, on the advice of the Congregation, John Paul II declared Padre Pio blessed. A media offensive by the Capuchins was able to realise a broad acceptation of the contested saint in society.<ref>Peter Jan Margry, 'Il \"marketing\" di Padre Pio.

They attended [[Holy Mass|Mass]] daily, prayed the [[Rosary]] nightly, and abstained from meat three days a week in honor of [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]].<ref name=\"ewtn1\"/> Although Francesco's parents and grandparents were illiterate, they narrated Bible stories to their children.\n\nAccording to the diary of Father Agostino da San Marco (who was later his spiritual director in [[San Marco in Lamis]]) the young Francesco was afflicted with a number of illnesses. At six he suffered from severe [[gastroenteritis]]. At ten he caught [[typhoid fever]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n[[File:KOS O PIO.jpg|thumb|left|The conventual cell of Padre Pio]]\nAs a youth, Francesco reported that he had experienced heavenly [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]s and [[Religious ecstasy|ecstasies]].<ref name=\"Ruffin\"/> In 1897, after he had completed three years at the public school, Francesco was said to have been drawn to the life of a friar after listening to a young [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] who was in the countryside seeking donations. When Francesco expressed his desire to his parents, they made a trip to [[Morcone]], a community {{convert|13|mi|km}} north of Pietrelcina, to find out if their son was eligible to enter the Order. The friars there informed them that they were interested in accepting Francesco into their community, but he needed to be better educated.<ref name=\"ewtn1\"/>\n\nFrancesco's father went to the [[United States]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1147|title=Saints|publisher=The American Catholic|accessdate=}}</ref> in search of work to pay for private tutoring for his son, to meet the academic requirements to enter the Capuchin Order.<ref name=\"Ruffin\"/> It was in this period that Francesco received the [[sacrament]] of [[Confirmation]] on 27 September 1899. He underwent private tutoring and passed the stipulated academic requirements. On 6 January 1903, at the age of 15, he entered the [[novitiate]] of the Capuchin friars at Morcone.

He vomited frequently and could digest only milk and cheese. Religious devotees point to this time that inexplicable phenomena allegedly began to occur. During prayers for example, Pio appeared to others to be in a stupor, as if he were absent. One of Pio's fellow friars later claimed to have seen him in [[religious ecstasy|\necstasy]], and allegedly [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitating]] above the ground.<ref>Renzo Allegri, ''I miracoli di Padre Pio'' p. 21.</ref>\n\nIn June 1905, Pio's health worsened to such an extent that his superiors decided to send him to a mountain convent, in the hope that the change of air would do him good. This had little impact, however, and doctors advised that he return home. Even there his health failed to improve. Despite this, On 27 January 1907, he still made his solemn [[Profession (religious)|profession]].\n\nIn 1910, Pio was subsequently [[ordination|ordained]] a priest by [[Archbishop]] Paolo Schinosi at the Cathedral of [[Benevento]]. Four days later, he offered his first Mass at the parish church of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady of the Angels]]. His health being precarious, he was permitted to remain with his family until 1916 while still retaining the Capuchin habit.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20020616_padre-pio_en.html \"Padre Pio da Pietrelcina\", Vatican News Service]</ref>\n\nOn 4 September 1916, however, Pio was ordered to return to his community life. He moved to an agricultural community, [[Our Lady of Grace]] Capuchin [[Monastery|Friary]], located in the Gargano Mountains in [[San Giovanni Rotondo]] in the [[Province of Foggia]]. At that time the community numbered seven friars. He went on to remain at San Giovanni Rotondo until his death in 1968, except for a period of military service. In the priesthood, Padre Pio was known to perform a number of successful conversions to Catholicism.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=3ApWCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT128&lpg=PT128&dq=padre+pio+mason+confession#v=onepage&q=%20mason%20&f=false | title=Padre Pio: The Stigmatist| isbn=9781618902634| last1=Charles Mortimer Carty| first1=Rev.

His advice on the practical application of theology he often summed up in his now famous quote, \"Pray, Hope and Don\u2019t Worry\". He directed Christians to recognize God in all things and to desire above all things to do the will of God.<ref name=\"ewtn2\"/>\n\nMany people who heard of him traveled to [[San Giovanni Rotondo]] to meet him and confess to him, ask for help, or have their curiosity satisfied. Pio's mother died at the village around the convent in 1928. Later, in 1938, Pio had his elderly father Grazio live with him. His brother Michele also moved in. Pio's father lived in a little house outside the convent, until his death in 1946.<ref>{{cite book|author =Ylva-Kristina Sj\u00f6blom|title=Padre Pio|publisher=Catholica|pages=10, 85}}</ref>\n\n===First World War and aftermath===\n\nWhen [[World War I]] started, four friars from this community were selected for military service in the Italian army. At that time, Padre Pio was a teacher at the seminary and a spiritual director. When one more friar was called into service, Pio was put in charge of the community. On 15 November 1915, he was drafted and on December 6, assigned to the 10th Medical Corps in [[Naples]]. Due to poor health, he was continually discharged and recalled until on 16 March 1918, he was declared unfit for service and discharged completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.padrepiodevotions.org/chronology.asp|title=Chronology|website=Padre Pio Devotions}}</ref>\n\nPeople who had started rebuilding their lives after the war began to see in Padre Pio a symbol of hope.<ref name=\"ewtn2\"/> Those close to him attest that he began to manifest several spiritual gifts, including the gifts of healing, [[bilocation]], levitation, [[prophecy]], [[miracle]]s, extraordinary abstinence from both sleep and nourishment (one account states that Padre Agostino recorded one instance in which Padre Pio was able to subsist for at least 20 days at Verafeno on only communion wafers without any other nourishment), the ability to read hearts, the gift of [[Glossolalia|tongues]], the gift of conversions, and pleasant-smelling wounds.<ref name = \"garabandal\">{{Cite web |last=Pelletier |first=Joseph A |title=Padre Pio, Mary, and the Rosary |website=Garabandal |url=http://www.garabandal.us/padre-pio-mary-and-the-rosary-rev-joseph-pelletier-aa |accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref>\n\nPadre Pio increasingly became well known among the wider populace.

He came to the conclusion that Francesco Forgione was a man of \"restricted field of knowledge, low psychic energy, monotonous ideas, little volition.\" <ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age.

P. 59.</ref>\n\nOn behalf of the Holy Office, Gemelli re-examined Father Pio in 1925, writing a report in April 1926. This time he let Pio show him the wounds. Gemelli saw as its cause the use of a corrosive substance. Pio had attached himself to these wounds. The Jesuit Festa had previously tried to question Gemelli's comments on stigmata in general.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 140.</ref> Gemelli responded to this criticism in his report and resorted to responding to his knowledge of self-inflicted wounds. He therefore clarified his statements about the nature of Pio's wounds: \"Anyone with experience in forensic medicine, and above all in variety by sores and wounds that self-destructive soldiers were presented during the war, can have no doubt that these were wounds of erosion caused by the use of a caustic substance.

Rossi began his [[Canonical visitation|Apostolic Visitation]] on June 14 in San Giovanni Rotondo with the interrogation of witnesses, two [[diocesan priests]] and seven [[friars]]. After eight days of investigation, he finally completed a benevolent report, which he sent to the Holy Office on October 4, 1921, the feast of St. Francis of Assisi. The extensive and detailed report essentially stated the following: Father Pio, of whom Rossi had a favorable impression, was a good religious and the San Giovanni Rotondo convent was a good community. Whatever is extraordinary about what Father Pio does that can not be explained, but certainly not by the intervention of the devil, or by deception or dizziness.

Overall impression: pitiful.\"<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 273.</ref> Maccari demanded Father Pio's omission to practice kisses after the confession for the lay sisters. In his report, Maccari noted that Pio had inadequate religious education. He works a lot for a man of his age. He is not an ascetic and has many connections to the outside world. In general, there is too much mixing of the \"sacred\" and the \"all too human\".<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 274.</ref> Maccari noted in his report by name, which woman stated at what time to have been the lover of Pio - without clearly assessing whether all these statements were true.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age , p. 274.</ref> Maccari focused on assessing the fanaticism of Pio's social environment, describing it as \"religious conceptions that oscillate between superstition and magic.\"<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 275.</ref> Maccari called Pio's supporters \"a vast and dangerous organization.\"<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age , p. 276.</ref> Pio never had his own supporters advised to moderation.

The brothers of Santa Maria delle Grazie should gradually be relocated, a new abbot should come from outside the region. No one should be allowed to confess to Pio more than once a month.

The Vatican was initially skeptical.\n\n===Stigmata===\nBased on Pio's correspondence, even early in his priesthood he experienced less obvious indications of the visible [[stigmata]]: bodily marks, pain, and bleeding in locations supposedly corresponding to the [[crucifixion]] wounds of [[Jesus Christ]].<ref name=\"stigmata\">{{cite book|last = McGregor, O.C.S.O| first = Augustine| author2 = Fr.

In the middle of the palms of my hands a red mark appeared, about the size of a penny, accompanied by acute pain in the middle of the red marks. The pain was more pronounced in the middle of the left hand, so much so that I can still feel it. Also under my feet I can feel some pain.<ref name=\"stigmata\"/></blockquote>\n\nAlready in a letter dated March 21, 1912, to his spiritual companion and confessor, Father Agostino, Father Pio wrote of his devotion to the mystical body of Christ and the intuition that he, Pio, one day himself would bear the stigmata of Christ. Luzzatto points out that in this letter Father Pio uses unrecognized passages from a book by the stigmatized mystic [[Gemma Galgani]]. Later Pio denied knowing or owning the cited book.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011):  Padre Pio: ''Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age'', p. 19.</ref>\n\nHis close friend Padre Agostino wrote in 1915, asking specific questions, such as when he first experienced visions, whether he had been granted the stigmata, and whether he felt the pains of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], namely the crowning of thorns and the scourging. Pio replied that he had been favoured with visions since his novitiate period (1903 to 1904). Although he had been granted the stigmata, he had been so terrified by the phenomenon he begged the Lord to withdraw them. He wrote that he did not wish the pain to be removed, only the visible wounds, since he considered them to be an indescribable and almost unbearable humiliation.<ref name=\"stigmata\"/>\n\nOn 20 September 1918, while hearing confessions, Pio claimed to have had a reappearance of the physical occurrence of the stigmata.  The phenomenon was reported to have continued for fifty years, until the end of his life. The blood flowing from the stigmata purportedly smelled of perfume or flowers.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} He reported to Agostino that the pain remained and was more acute on specific days and under certain circumstances. He also said that he was suffering the pain of the crown of thorns and the scourging. He did not define the frequency of these occurrences but said that he had been suffering from them at least once weekly for some years.<ref name=\"stigmata\"/> Though Pio said he would have preferred to suffer in secret, by early 1919, news had begun to spread. Pio often wore red mittens or black coverings on his hands and feet as he was embarrassed by the marks.<ref name=\"time2\"/> However, no visible scarring was present at the time of Pio's death.<ref>{{cite web|date=2006-05-12|url=http://www.padrepio.com/his-life| title =Padre Pio's Cell| website =Padre Pio Foundation| accessdate = 2006-05-12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Padre-Pio-young.jpg|thumb|left|Padre Pio showing the [[stigmata]] (detail from a photo from August 19, 1919) <ref>Complete illustration of the photograph by [[Urte Krass]]: ''Kontrollierter Gesichtsverlust.

[...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation<ref name=\"cantius\">{{Cite web| title = First class relic of St. Padre Pio of Pietrelcina at St. John Cantius Church| url = http://www.cantius.org/go/organizations/relic_of_st_padre_pio_of_pietrelcina| accessdate = 2008-01-19| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>....the pain was so intense that I began to feel as if I were dying on the cross.<ref>Fortin, Fr.

He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed steel blade which seemed to emit fire. At the very instant that I saw all this, I saw that person hurl the weapon into my soul with all his might. I cried out with difficulty and felt I was dying. I asked the boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot tell you how much I suffered during this period of anguish. Even my entrails were torn and ruptured by the weapon, and nothing was spared. From that day on I have been mortally wounded. I feel in the depths of my soul a wound that is always open and which causes me continual agony.<ref name=\"cantius\"/></blockquote>\n\nOn 20 September 1918, accounts state that the pains of the transverberation had ceased and Pio was in \"profound peace.\"<ref name = \"gerhold\"/> On that day, as he was engaged in prayer in the choir loft in the Church of Our Lady of Grace, he received another celestial vision which led to [[religious ecstasy]].

On 21 September 1968, the day after the 50th anniversary of his receiving the stigmata, Padre Pio felt great fatigue.<ref name=\"PioProfile\"/>  The next day, on September 22, 1968, he was supposed to offer a [[Solemn Mass]], but feeling weak, he asked his superior if he might say a [[Low Mass]] instead, as he had done daily for years. Due to the large number of pilgrims present for the Mass, Padre Pio's superior decided the Solemn Mass must proceed. Padre Pio carried out his duties but appeared extremely weak and fragile. His voice was weak and, after the Mass had concluded, he nearly collapsed while walking down the altar steps. He needed help from his Capuchin brothers. This was his last celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].\n\nEarly in the morning of 23 September 1968, Pio made his last [[Sacrament of Reconciliation|confession]] and renewed his Franciscan vows.<ref name=\"ewtn2\"/> As was customary, he had his [[rosary]] in his hands, though he did not have the strength to say the [[Hail Mary]]s aloud. Till the end, he repeated the words \"Ges\u00f9, Maria\" (Jesus, Mary). At around 2:30&nbsp;a.m., he said, \"I see two mothers\" (taken to mean his mother and Mary).<ref name=\"PioProfile\"/>  At 2:30&nbsp;a.m. he died in his cell in San Giovanni Rotondo.

The investigation continued for seven years. In 1990 Pio was declared a [[Servant of God]], the first step in the process of canonization. The investigation, however, did not lead to any public factual clearance by the Church on his previous 'excommunication' or on the allegations that his stigmata were not of a supernatural kind. Moreover, Pio's stigmata were remarkably left out of the obligatory investigations for the canonization process, in order to avoid obstacles prohibiting a successful closure.\n\nBeginning in 1990, the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] debated how Padre Pio had lived his life, and in 1997 Pope John Paul II declared him [[venerable]]. A discussion of the effects of his life on others followed. Cases were studied such as a reported cure of an Italian woman, Consiglia de Martino, associated with Padre Pio's [[intercession]]. In 1999, on the advice of the Congregation, John Paul II declared Padre Pio blessed. A media offensive by the Capuchins was able to realise a broad acceptation of the contested saint in society.<ref>Peter Jan Margry, 'Il \"marketing\" di Padre Pio.

Fred is the husband of [[Wilma Flintstone]] and father of [[Pebbles Flintstone]]. His best friend is his next door neighbor, [[Barney Rubble|Barney]], who has a wife named [[Betty Rubble|Betty]] and an adopted son, named [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]].<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=flintstones The Flintstones] ''[[The Museum of Broadcast Communications]]''</ref>\n\nFred lives in the fictional [[prehistoric]] town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]], a world where dinosaurs coexist with modernized [[caveman|cavepeople]] and the cavepeople enjoy \"primitive\" versions of [[modern conveniences]] such as [[telephone]]s, [[automobile]]s, and [[washing machine]]s. Fred's trademark catchphrase yell is \"yabba dabba doo!\", a phrase that was originally his club's cheer, and later adopted as part of the theme song from the third season on and used in the [[The Flintstones (film)|1994 live-action ''Flintstones'' movie]].\n\nSince the original series' run, Fred has appeared in various other cartoon spinoffs, live action adaptations, music videos, and [[television commercial|commercial]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nWhile the mid-1980s [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' depicts Fred as a child, the series may be [[apocryphal]] due to its presenting Wilma as a childhood friend of Fred and Barney; the original series asserts that they first met as young adults.<ref name=\"bachelor\">\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> Still, the series' depictions that Fred is the only child of Ed and Edna Flintstone (a handyman and a [[housewife|homemaker]], respectively) might be taken as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]. In the long-running Flintstones newspaper comic strip by [[Gene Hazelton]], Fred's father, '''Pops Flintstone''', was a recurring character.<ref>https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uixhK3mS6Yw/VwQXPSOzfBI/AAAAAAABj9A/ypZWn57gvkk750lJj5CtofFfQyRLU6Uag/s1600/Flintstones-1967-08-26.jpg</ref>\n\nAs young adults, Fred and Barney worked as bellhops at a resort. There, they meet and fall in love with Wilma and Betty, who were working there as [[cigarette girl]]s. Fred and Wilma's mother, [[Pearl Slaghoople]], also met and took an instant dislike to each other, starting a long-lasting rivalry between the two.<ref name=\"bachelor\"/> An unspecified amount of time later, Fred married Wilma.\n\nFred is a typical [[blue-collar worker]], who works as a \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] crane operator\" at Slate Rock and Gravel Company (also known as Rockhead and Quarry Cave Construction Company in earlier episodes). Fred's job title in the second-season episode \"Divided We Sail\" is \"geological engineer\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580165/|title=Divided We Sail|via=www.imdb.com|accessdate=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\nDuring the original series' third season, Wilma gives birth to the couple's daughter, Pebbles. Years later, when Pebbles is a teenager, Fred and Barney join the Bedrock [[police]] force for a time as part-time [[police officer]]s.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" /> Eventually, Fred becomes a [[grandfather]] to the adult Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's twins, Chip and Roxy. Fred's family grew again in ''[[A Flintstone Family Christmas]]'', when he and Wilma adopted an orphaned caveboy named Stony, and despite a rough start, Fred and his new son bonded well.\n\n==Relatives==\nThe Flintstone family's paternal side originally came from the prehistoric state of Arkanstone, where they had been engaged in a feud similar to the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]]. The feud was originally started by an ancestor of Fred's making a joke about a Hatrock family portrait (\"I don't know what the artist got for doing that painting, but he should've gotten life!\"). In the fourth-season episode \"Bedrock Hillbillies,\" the feud is ended when Fred helps rescue Pebbles and a Hatrock baby, only to start up again when Fred makes the same joke as his ancestor. The Hatrocks later appear in the follow-up fifth-season episode \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\", where they visit Bedrock. The last of the Arkanstone Flintstones was Fred's great-great-uncle Zeke Flintstone who lived to 102.\n\nOther relatives of Fred include: Rockbottom \"Rocky/Stony\" Flintstone, Fred's grandfather, who was a veteran of Stone World War One;<ref name=\"raiders\" />; Uncle Giggles Flintstone, a rich, eccentric practical joker whose jokes drive Fred into a mad rage;<ref name=\"haunted\" /> James Hardrock, Edna's father; Uncle Tex Hardrock, Fred's rich Texan uncle;<ref name=\"tex\" /> Tumbleweed and Mary Lou Jim, Fred's rich Texan cousins;<ref name=\"droop\" />  .\n[[File:Jackie Gleason - 1966.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Flintstones'' character was based on the character [[Ralph Kramden]] ([[Jackie Gleason]]) from ''[[The Honeymooners]]'']]\n\n==Personality==\nFred's personality was based on that of [[Ralph Kramden]] of the 1950s television series ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' and Chester A. Riley from ''[[The Life of Riley]]'', both of whom were originally portrayed on television by [[Jackie Gleason]] (Riley was originally portrayed on radio, film and later television episodes by [[William Bendix]]). Much like Ralph, Fred tends to be loud-mouthed, aggressive, and constantly scheming ways to improve his family's working class lot in life, often with unintended results. Also like Ralph, despite his harshness, he is friendly, and has a loving heart, who is very devoted to his family and cares a lot about his best friend and next door neighbor [[Barney Rubble]]. Fred loses his temper easily and is very impatient, but he seems free of malice and never holds a grudge. Although his loudness irritates the people around him, Fred proves friendly, often going out of his way to help others. Also, although Fred often annoys Wilma with his immaturity, he is known to go to great lengths to please his family and apologize when he goes too far. Other known characters from other programs may also be known to have personalities based on Fred Flintstone including [[Archie Bunker]] from ''[[All In The Family]]'' and ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'' (both played by [[Carroll OConnor]]), [[George Jefferson]] from ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' (played by [[Sherman Hemsley]]), [[Mel Sharples]] from ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' (played by [[Vic Tayback]]) and Frank DeFazio from ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' (played by [[Phil Foster]]).\n\nFred's interests include [[bowling]], playing [[Billiards|pool]], [[golf]], [[poker]] and lounging around the house. Fred has won championships with his bowling skills; in one episode, he goes so far as to take [[ballet]] lessons in order to improve his game.<ref>\"Bowling Ballet,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref> The nickname of \"Twinkletoes\" stuck with him when Fred attended a local university and became eligible to play on their football team, and it became his [[call sign]].<ref>\"Flintstone of Prinstone,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an excellent golfer. Fred is a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffalos Lodge (named \"the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs\" in an early episode).<ref name=\"hotlips\">\"Hot Lips Hannigan,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 1</ref> Fred also has a serious [[gambling problem]]; the mere mention of the word \"bet\" causes Fred to stammer \"bet\" over and over again (sounding like a clucking chicken) and go on gambling binges.<ref>\"The Gambler,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an avid driver. In the fifth-season episode \"Indianrockolis 500,\" Fred entered the [[Indianapolis 500|famed prehistoric auto race]] under the [[pseudonym]] \"Goggles Paisano\".<ref>{{YouTube|GmQoWQb4tx0}}</ref>\n\nFred's [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba-Dabba-Doo!\"; [[Alan Reed]], voice actor who provided Fred's voice from 1960\u20131977, reportedly said that the inspiration for the phrase came from his mother, who used to say, \"A little dab'll do ya,\" probably borrowed from a Brylcreem commercial. When the script called for a simple 'Yahoo!' Alan either asked if he could alter the phrase or he ad-libbed. It inspired, in the 1970s a short-lived fruit drink called \"Yabba Dabba Dew\" and may or may not have also inspired [[George Jetson]]'s similar-sounding catchphrase, \"Hooba-dooba-dooba\" (or \"Hooba-Dooba\"). It does, however, become the subject of a song by [[Hoagy Carmichael]] that the singer-songwriter performs in an episode of ''The Flintstones''<ref>. In \"The Hit Song Writers,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred's ability to carry a tune was quite good in his younger years. One early episode<ref name=\"hotlips\" /> sees Fred (with Barney, who is a skilled [[drummer]]) perform at a nightclub with his musician friend \"Hot Lips Hannigan\" where his singing caused teenage girls to swoon over him; on this occasion, he was nicknamed \"the [[Mel Torme|Golden Smog]]\". In another first-season episode, \"Girls' Night Out\", Fred recorded a demo record at a [[carnival]] of the song \"[[Listen to the Mockingbird|Listen to the Rocking Bird]]\", which ended up making him a teenage singing idol named \"Hi Fye.\" As the series progressed, however, his voice became worse and worse (even during his success as a singer, Wilma was never impressed by Fred's voice), eventually to the point that a temporary maid the Flintstones hired quit rather than having to hear Fred sing.<ref>\"Wilma, the Maid,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref>\n\nDue to his impulsive and short-tempered behavior and stubborn and somewhat selfish nature, Fred seems to be accident-prone. Even his most innocent and mundane actions often cause widespread confusion. At the end of the closing credits, Fred begins to knock the door of his house and starts yelling \"Wilma\", to open the door.\n\nAccording to the original series' third-season episode \"The Birthday Party\" (originally aired April 5, 1963), Fred's birthday is February 2. Fred's address has varied through the series' run, with addresses given for the Flintstone residence including 345 Cave Stone Road, and 1313 Cobblestone Way. Fred's address was cited as \"55 Cobblestone Rd\" in the 1961 episode \"The X-Ray Story\".\n\n==Animated media==\n===Television shows===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Series number\n!style=\"width:250px;\"|Title\n!style=\"width:100px;\"|Broadcast run\n!style=\"width:150px;\"|Original channel\n!style=\"width:175px;\"|Total # episodes\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Total # seasons\n|-\n|1\n|''[[The Flintstones]]''\n|1960\u20131966\n|[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|[[List of The Flintstones episodes|166 episodes]]\n|6\n|-\n|2\n|''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''\n|1971\u20131972\n|rowspan=\"3\" | [[CBS]]\n|16 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|3\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]''\n|1972\u20131973\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 18 episodes\n|-\n|4\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''{{Efn|A re-titled second season of reruns featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Hour''.}}\n|1973\u20131974\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\"|\n|-\n|5\n|''[[Fred Flintstone and Friends]]''{{Efn|A 30-minute weekday animated series which aired in first-run syndication.}}\n|1977\u20131978\n|[[Broadcast syndication|Syndication]]\n|95 episodes\n|1\n|-\n|6\n|''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1979\n|rowspan=\"5\" | [[NBC]]\n|17 episodes\n|2\n|-\n|7\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]''\n|13 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|8\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' {{Efn|This 90-minute series featured reruns of ''Fred and Barney Meet the Thing'' combined with episodes of ''The New Shmoo''.}}\n|1979\u20131980\n|17 episodes\n|-\n|9\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''\n|1980\u20131982\n|18 episodes\n|rowspan=\"3\" | 2\n|-\n|10\n|''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]''{{Efn|A compilation series featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Show''.}}\n|1982\u20131984\n|26 episodes\n|-\n|11\n|''[[The Flintstone Kids]]''\n|1986\u20131988\n|[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|[[List of The Flintstone Kids episodes|34 episodes]]\n|-\n|12\n|''[[Cave Kids]]''\n|1996\n|[[Cartoon Network]]\n|8 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|13\n|''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]''\n|2020<!-- Do NOT link this title to \"Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs!

After extolling the virtues of the Winston brand cigarette, Fred lit up his cigarette and delivered the catch phrase: \"[[Winston tastes good like a cigarette should]]\". Another similar ad for the cigarettes featured Wilma and Betty as well; the women were working hard mowing the lawn and beating dust out of a rug while Fred and Barney smoked behind the house. Vignettes also aired in which Fred lit Wilma's Winston cigarette, and the couple shared a smoke. By the original series' third season, Winston had been dropped as a sponsor in favor of [[Welch's]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legendsrevealed.com/entertainment/2012/12/09/did-the-flintstones-do-commercials-for-winston-cigarettes/|title=Did the Flintstones Do Commercials for Winston Cigarettes?|date=2012-12-09|accessdate=2019-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Flintstones Chewable Vitamins]]\n*[[Pebbles Cereal]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Yabba Dabba Doo!

Fred is the husband of [[Wilma Flintstone]] and father of [[Pebbles Flintstone]]. His best friend is his next door neighbor, [[Barney Rubble|Barney]], who has a wife named [[Betty Rubble|Betty]] and an adopted son, named [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]].<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=flintstones The Flintstones] ''[[The Museum of Broadcast Communications]]''</ref>\n\nFred lives in the fictional [[prehistoric]] town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]], a world where dinosaurs coexist with modernized [[caveman|cavepeople]] and the cavepeople enjoy \"primitive\" versions of [[modern conveniences]] such as [[telephone]]s, [[automobile]]s, and [[washing machine]]s. Fred's trademark catchphrase yell is \"yabba dabba doo!\", a phrase that was originally his club's cheer, and later adopted as part of the theme song from the third season on and used in the [[The Flintstones (film)|1994 live-action ''Flintstones'' movie]].\n\nSince the original series' run, Fred has appeared in various other cartoon spinoffs, live action adaptations, music videos, and [[television commercial|commercial]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nWhile the mid-1980s [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' depicts Fred as a child, the series may be [[apocryphal]] due to its presenting Wilma as a childhood friend of Fred and Barney; the original series asserts that they first met as young adults.<ref name=\"bachelor\">\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> Still, the series' depictions that Fred is the only child of Ed and Edna Flintstone (a handyman and a [[housewife|homemaker]], respectively) might be taken as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]. In the long-running Flintstones newspaper comic strip by [[Gene Hazelton]], Fred's father, '''Pops Flintstone''', was a recurring character.<ref>https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uixhK3mS6Yw/VwQXPSOzfBI/AAAAAAABj9A/ypZWn57gvkk750lJj5CtofFfQyRLU6Uag/s1600/Flintstones-1967-08-26.jpg</ref>\n\nAs young adults, Fred and Barney worked as bellhops at a resort. There, they meet and fall in love with Wilma and Betty, who were working there as [[cigarette girl]]s. Fred and Wilma's mother, [[Pearl Slaghoople]], also met and took an instant dislike to each other, starting a long-lasting rivalry between the two.<ref name=\"bachelor\"/> An unspecified amount of time later, Fred married Wilma.\n\nFred is a typical [[blue-collar worker]], who works as a \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] crane operator\" at Slate Rock and Gravel Company (also known as Rockhead and Quarry Cave Construction Company in earlier episodes). Fred's job title in the second-season episode \"Divided We Sail\" is \"geological engineer\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580165/|title=Divided We Sail|via=www.imdb.com|accessdate=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\nDuring the original series' third season, Wilma gives birth to the couple's daughter, Pebbles. Years later, when Pebbles is a teenager, Fred and Barney join the Bedrock [[police]] force for a time as part-time [[police officer]]s.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" /> Eventually, Fred becomes a [[grandfather]] to the adult Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's twins, Chip and Roxy. Fred's family grew again in ''[[A Flintstone Family Christmas]]'', when he and Wilma adopted an orphaned caveboy named Stony, and despite a rough start, Fred and his new son bonded well.\n\n==Relatives==\nThe Flintstone family's paternal side originally came from the prehistoric state of Arkanstone, where they had been engaged in a feud similar to the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]]. The feud was originally started by an ancestor of Fred's making a joke about a Hatrock family portrait (\"I don't know what the artist got for doing that painting, but he should've gotten life!\"). In the fourth-season episode \"Bedrock Hillbillies,\" the feud is ended when Fred helps rescue Pebbles and a Hatrock baby, only to start up again when Fred makes the same joke as his ancestor. The Hatrocks later appear in the follow-up fifth-season episode \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\", where they visit Bedrock. The last of the Arkanstone Flintstones was Fred's great-great-uncle Zeke Flintstone who lived to 102.\n\nOther relatives of Fred include: Rockbottom \"Rocky/Stony\" Flintstone, Fred's grandfather, who was a veteran of Stone World War One;<ref name=\"raiders\" />; Uncle Giggles Flintstone, a rich, eccentric practical joker whose jokes drive Fred into a mad rage;<ref name=\"haunted\" /> James Hardrock, Edna's father; Uncle Tex Hardrock, Fred's rich Texan uncle;<ref name=\"tex\" /> Tumbleweed and Mary Lou Jim, Fred's rich Texan cousins;<ref name=\"droop\" />  .\n[[File:Jackie Gleason - 1966.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Flintstones'' character was based on the character [[Ralph Kramden]] ([[Jackie Gleason]]) from ''[[The Honeymooners]]'']]\n\n==Personality==\nFred's personality was based on that of [[Ralph Kramden]] of the 1950s television series ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' and Chester A. Riley from ''[[The Life of Riley]]'', both of whom were originally portrayed on television by [[Jackie Gleason]] (Riley was originally portrayed on radio, film and later television episodes by [[William Bendix]]). Much like Ralph, Fred tends to be loud-mouthed, aggressive, and constantly scheming ways to improve his family's working class lot in life, often with unintended results. Also like Ralph, despite his harshness, he is friendly, and has a loving heart, who is very devoted to his family and cares a lot about his best friend and next door neighbor [[Barney Rubble]]. Fred loses his temper easily and is very impatient, but he seems free of malice and never holds a grudge. Although his loudness irritates the people around him, Fred proves friendly, often going out of his way to help others. Also, although Fred often annoys Wilma with his immaturity, he is known to go to great lengths to please his family and apologize when he goes too far. Other known characters from other programs may also be known to have personalities based on Fred Flintstone including [[Archie Bunker]] from ''[[All In The Family]]'' and ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'' (both played by [[Carroll OConnor]]), [[George Jefferson]] from ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' (played by [[Sherman Hemsley]]), [[Mel Sharples]] from ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' (played by [[Vic Tayback]]) and Frank DeFazio from ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' (played by [[Phil Foster]]).\n\nFred's interests include [[bowling]], playing [[Billiards|pool]], [[golf]], [[poker]] and lounging around the house. Fred has won championships with his bowling skills; in one episode, he goes so far as to take [[ballet]] lessons in order to improve his game.<ref>\"Bowling Ballet,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref> The nickname of \"Twinkletoes\" stuck with him when Fred attended a local university and became eligible to play on their football team, and it became his [[call sign]].<ref>\"Flintstone of Prinstone,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an excellent golfer. Fred is a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffalos Lodge (named \"the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs\" in an early episode).<ref name=\"hotlips\">\"Hot Lips Hannigan,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 1</ref> Fred also has a serious [[gambling problem]]; the mere mention of the word \"bet\" causes Fred to stammer \"bet\" over and over again (sounding like a clucking chicken) and go on gambling binges.<ref>\"The Gambler,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an avid driver. In the fifth-season episode \"Indianrockolis 500,\" Fred entered the [[Indianapolis 500|famed prehistoric auto race]] under the [[pseudonym]] \"Goggles Paisano\".<ref>{{YouTube|GmQoWQb4tx0}}</ref>\n\nFred's [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba-Dabba-Doo!\"; [[Alan Reed]], voice actor who provided Fred's voice from 1960\u20131977, reportedly said that the inspiration for the phrase came from his mother, who used to say, \"A little dab'll do ya,\" probably borrowed from a Brylcreem commercial. When the script called for a simple 'Yahoo!' Alan either asked if he could alter the phrase or he ad-libbed. It inspired, in the 1970s a short-lived fruit drink called \"Yabba Dabba Dew\" and may or may not have also inspired [[George Jetson]]'s similar-sounding catchphrase, \"Hooba-dooba-dooba\" (or \"Hooba-Dooba\"). It does, however, become the subject of a song by [[Hoagy Carmichael]] that the singer-songwriter performs in an episode of ''The Flintstones''<ref>. In \"The Hit Song Writers,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred's ability to carry a tune was quite good in his younger years. One early episode<ref name=\"hotlips\" /> sees Fred (with Barney, who is a skilled [[drummer]]) perform at a nightclub with his musician friend \"Hot Lips Hannigan\" where his singing caused teenage girls to swoon over him; on this occasion, he was nicknamed \"the [[Mel Torme|Golden Smog]]\". In another first-season episode, \"Girls' Night Out\", Fred recorded a demo record at a [[carnival]] of the song \"[[Listen to the Mockingbird|Listen to the Rocking Bird]]\", which ended up making him a teenage singing idol named \"Hi Fye.\" As the series progressed, however, his voice became worse and worse (even during his success as a singer, Wilma was never impressed by Fred's voice), eventually to the point that a temporary maid the Flintstones hired quit rather than having to hear Fred sing.<ref>\"Wilma, the Maid,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref>\n\nDue to his impulsive and short-tempered behavior and stubborn and somewhat selfish nature, Fred seems to be accident-prone. Even his most innocent and mundane actions often cause widespread confusion. At the end of the closing credits, Fred begins to knock the door of his house and starts yelling \"Wilma\", to open the door.\n\nAccording to the original series' third-season episode \"The Birthday Party\" (originally aired April 5, 1963), Fred's birthday is February 2. Fred's address has varied through the series' run, with addresses given for the Flintstone residence including 345 Cave Stone Road, and 1313 Cobblestone Way.

Rozenbaum had suggested at scientific meetings that the cause of the disease might be a [[retrovirus]]. Montagnier and members of his group at the [[Pasteur Institute]], notably including [[Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi]] and [[Jean-Claude Chermann]], had extensive experience with retroviruses. Montagnier and his team examined samples taken from Rozenbaum's AIDS patients and found the virus that would later become known as HIV in a [[lymph node]] [[biopsy]]. They named it \"lymphadenopathy-associated virus\", or LAV, since it was not then clear that it was the cause of AIDS, and published their findings in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on 20 May 1983.<ref name=\"Science4599\"/>\n\nA team led by [[Robert Gallo]] of the United States published similar findings in the same issue of ''Science'' and later confirmed the discovery of the virus and presented evidence that it caused AIDS. Gallo called the virus \"human T-lymphotropic virus type III\" (HTLV-III) because of perceived similarities with HTLV-I and -II, which had previously been discovered in his lab.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Popovic M, Sarngadharan MG, Read E, Gallo RC|title=Detection, isolation, and continuous production of cytopathic retroviruses (HTLV-III) from patients with AIDS and pre-AIDS|journal=Science|volume=224|issue=4648|pages=497\u2013500|year=1984|pmid=6200935|doi=10.1126/science.6200935|bibcode=1984Sci...224..497P }}</ref> Because of the timing of the discoveries, whether Montagnier's or Gallo's group was first to isolate HIV was for many years the subject of an acrimonious dispute. HIV isolates usually have a high degree of variability because the virus mutates rapidly. In comparison, the first two human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates, Lai/LAV (formerly LAV, isolated at the Pasteur Institute) and Lai/IIIB (formerly HTLV-IIIB, isolated from a pooled culture at the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the [[National Cancer Institute]]) were strikingly similar in sequence, suggesting that the two isolates were in fact the same, or at least shared a common source.\n\nIn November 1990, the [[United States Office of Research Integrity|Office of Scientific Integrity]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] attempted to clear up the matter by commissioning a group at [[Hoffmann\u2013La Roche|Roche]] to analyze archival samples established at the Pasteur Institute and the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the National Cancer Institute between 1983 and 1985. The group, led by Sheng-Yung Chang, examined archival specimens and concluded in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1993 that Gallo's virus had come from Montagnier's lab.\n\nChang determined that the French group's LAV was a virus from one patient that had contaminated a culture from another. On request, Montagnier's group had sent a sample of this culture to Gallo, not knowing it contained two viruses. It then contaminated the pooled culture on which Gallo was working.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Sheng-Yung P. Chang|author2=Barbara H. Bowman|author3=Judith B. Weiss|author4=Rebeca E.

The scientific protagonists finally agreed to share credit for the discovery of HIV, and in 1986, both the French and the US names (LAV and HTLV-III) were dropped in favor of the new term ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (virus de l'immunod\u00e9ficience humaine, abbreviated HIV or VIH) (Coffin, 1986). They concluded that the origin of the HIV-1 Lai/IIIB isolate discovered by Gallo was the same as that discovered by Montagnier (but not known by Montagnier to cause AIDS). This compromise allowed Montagnier and Gallo to end their feud and collaborate with each other again, writing a chronology that appeared in ''Nature'' that year.<ref name=\"science nobel\"/>\n\nIn 29 November 2002 issue of ''Science'', Gallo and Montagnier published a series of articles, one of which was co-written by both scientists, in which they acknowledged the pivotal roles that each had played in the discovery of HIV.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Montagnier L|year=2002|title=Historical essay.

Robert, who had tried to succeed the company Digibio created by Jacques Benveniste, approached Montagnier in May 2005 regarding his work on electromagnetic signals. \nIn November 2005, Robert registered a patent for the process of homing in on a \"biochemical element presenting a biological activity through the analysis of low-frequency electromagnetic signals.\" This patent was in fact written by Montagnier from results obtained between July and November 2005.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} A month later, [[Institut national de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 industrielle|INPI]], France's patents body, received a request for the same patent from Montagnier,<ref name=Montagnier_patent>{{cite web|url=http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=WO&NR=2007068831A2&KC=A3&FT=D&date=20070809&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP|title=Montagnier's patent application|publisher=V3.espacenet.com|accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> which was criticized by the patent examiner on multiple points, including the following:\n\n: \"... the invention is based on phenomena which contradict the fundamental principle of physics and of chemistry, i.e. the existence of biological or effect without an active molecule and no explanation or theoretical basis makes it impossible at the current time to explain the results obtained.\"<ref name=patent_examiner>[http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wads.jsp?IA=FR2006002735&LANGUAGE=EN&ID=id00000006560269&VOL=89&DOC=000162&WO=07/068831&WEEK=NA&TYPE=NA&DOC_TYPE=ETWOS&PAGE=10 Patent examiner's assessment, p. 10]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

Rozenbaum had suggested at scientific meetings that the cause of the disease might be a [[retrovirus]]. Montagnier and members of his group at the [[Pasteur Institute]], notably including [[Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi]] and [[Jean-Claude Chermann]], had extensive experience with retroviruses. Montagnier and his team examined samples taken from Rozenbaum's AIDS patients and found the virus that would later become known as HIV in a [[lymph node]] [[biopsy]]. They named it \"lymphadenopathy-associated virus\", or LAV, since it was not then clear that it was the cause of AIDS, and published their findings in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on 20 May 1983.<ref name=\"Science4599\"/>\n\nA team led by [[Robert Gallo]] of the United States published similar findings in the same issue of ''Science'' and later confirmed the discovery of the virus and presented evidence that it caused AIDS. Gallo called the virus \"human T-lymphotropic virus type III\" (HTLV-III) because of perceived similarities with HTLV-I and -II, which had previously been discovered in his lab.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Popovic M, Sarngadharan MG, Read E, Gallo RC|title=Detection, isolation, and continuous production of cytopathic retroviruses (HTLV-III) from patients with AIDS and pre-AIDS|journal=Science|volume=224|issue=4648|pages=497\u2013500|year=1984|pmid=6200935|doi=10.1126/science.6200935|bibcode=1984Sci...224..497P }}</ref> Because of the timing of the discoveries, whether Montagnier's or Gallo's group was first to isolate HIV was for many years the subject of an acrimonious dispute. HIV isolates usually have a high degree of variability because the virus mutates rapidly. In comparison, the first two human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates, Lai/LAV (formerly LAV, isolated at the Pasteur Institute) and Lai/IIIB (formerly HTLV-IIIB, isolated from a pooled culture at the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the [[National Cancer Institute]]) were strikingly similar in sequence, suggesting that the two isolates were in fact the same, or at least shared a common source.\n\nIn November 1990, the [[United States Office of Research Integrity|Office of Scientific Integrity]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] attempted to clear up the matter by commissioning a group at [[Hoffmann\u2013La Roche|Roche]] to analyze archival samples established at the Pasteur Institute and the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the National Cancer Institute between 1983 and 1985. The group, led by Sheng-Yung Chang, examined archival specimens and concluded in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1993 that Gallo's virus had come from Montagnier's lab.\n\nChang determined that the French group's LAV was a virus from one patient that had contaminated a culture from another.
