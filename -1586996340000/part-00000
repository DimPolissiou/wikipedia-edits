This tends to include mountains with technical rope access issues, snow, avalanches, ice, crevasses, glaciers, alpine environments and high altitudes. The difficult and remote nature of the terrain in which mountain rescue often occurs has resulted in the development of a number of specific pieces of equipment and techniques. [[Helicopter]]s are often used to quickly extract casualties, and search dogs may be deployed to find a casualty.\n\nMountain rescue services may be paid professionals or volunteer professionals. Paid rescue services are more likely to exist in places with a high demand such as the [[Alps]], [[national park]]s with mountain terrain and many [[ski resort]]s. However, the labor-intensive and occasional nature of mountain rescue, along with the specific techniques and local knowledge required for some environments, means that mountain rescue is often undertaken by voluntary teams. These are frequently made up of local climbers and guides. Often paid rescue services may work in co-operation with voluntary services. For instance, a paid helicopter rescue team may work with a volunteer mountain rescue team on the ground. Mountain rescue is often free, although in some parts of the world rescue organizations may charge for their services. But there are also exceptions, e.g. [[Switzerland]], where mountain rescue is highly expensive (some 2,000 to US$4,000) and will be charged to the patient. In more remote or less-developed\nparts of the world organized mountain rescue services are often negligible or non-existent.\n\n==By country==\n\n===Austria===\n\u00d6sterreichischer Bergrettungsdienst (\u00d6BRD) performs mountain rescue operations in the Austrian [[Alps]] and in [[Waldviertel]].\n\nAlpiner Rettungsausschu\u00df [[Vienna|Wien]] (ARAW) was founded in 1896 after an avalanche on [[Rax]] killed three mountaineers.

The unit is divided into five regions ([[Jaca]], [[Cangas de On\u00eds]], [[Navacerrada]], [[Granada]], [[Vielha e Mijaran]]). In 2011 they carried out 761 missions.\n\nIn [[Catalonia]] a special division of the fire department, GRAE (Support Group for Special Actions), are responsible for mountain rescue.\n\n===Switzerland===\n\nSwitzerland has an incredibly dense network of alpine rescue and relief organisations. Most of the rescue are operated by [[Rega (air rescue)|Swiss Air-Rescue Rega]] ({{lang-de|Schweizerische Rettungsflugwacht}}, {{lang-fr|Garde a\u00e9rienne suisse de sauvetage, Rega}}), a non-profit organisation that provide alpine rescue with its fleet of 17 medical helicopters, including 11 Agusta A109 SP Grand \"Da Vinci\", used both in ground support of paramedical personnel and frontline alpine rescue. \nSwiss Air-Rescue Rega has two very distinctive characteristics: they can reach any place in Switzerland under 15 minutes, due to their ten bases, and they are medicalized. This means an emergency physician (mostly an anesthesist) will be on the flight to provide advanced treatment.\n\nThe Swiss canton of Valais doesn't use Rega, they have their own rescue fleet, named Air Glacier and Air Zermatt. They have similar colours, procedures and personnel.\n\nThe Swiss army is also used in frontline rescue of civilians. Their many mountain battalions are commonly used in collaboration with the Rega, due to their manpower, heavy equipment and proven experience of collaboration with civilian authorities.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{main|Mountain rescue in England and Wales|Mountain Rescue Committee of Scotland}}\n[[File:Stretcher Box at Styhead - geograph.org.uk - 730830.jpg|thumb|Stretcher box in Cumbria, England, prepositioned equipment saves mountain rescue teams having to trudge up mountains with it.]]\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], mountain rescue is mostly a free service, provided by volunteers.

It is handled by 'career, on-duty and on-call paid' teams within the national parks, and supplemented by other paid and volunteer assets/resources as needed. For areas outside the national parks, there are approximately 20 agencies, mostly sheriff's departments, in the U.S. which provide paid or career members of a mountain SAR team. Most of those supplement with volunteer professionals. The bulk of mountain SAR operations in the U.S. are provided by 'volunteer professional' teams (are not career positions or paid but must meet minimum industry-accepted standards at or above their paid counterparts), who may also respond via mutual aid or automatic aid to incidents out-of-county, out-of-state and into national parks, via intrastate, interstate, and national park agreements, as well as via the FEMA NIMS national mutual aid deployment system.\nParks with paid teams include [[Denali National Park]], [[Yosemite National Park]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/sar/index.htm|title=Yosemite National Park: YOSAR|work=nps.gov|publisher=United States National Park Service|accessdate=24 January 2010}}</ref> [[Grand Teton National Park]], and [[Mount Rainier National Park]]. Many paid and volunteer professional mountain SAR teams are part of the [[Mountain rescue in the United States#Mountain Rescue Association|Mountain Rescue Association]] (MRA) and operate under the authority of the local sheriff's department (approximately 42 of the 50 states) or state police or emergency management agency. While teams are primarily responsible to operate in one county which could be from 50 square miles to 20,000 square miles, they typically respond to adjoining counties and states.\nUnder the [[National Incident Management System]], mountain rescue unit qualifications are standardized for those units which choose to be deployable for national disasters and national mutual aid outside their jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/emergency/usr/mountain_sar_team.htm|title=Resource: Mountain Search and Rescue Team|work=fema.gov|publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency|accessdate=25 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125155741/http://www.fema.gov/emergency/usr/mountain_sar_team.htm|archivedate=25 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Helicopter rescue basket]]\n* [[SAR dog]]\n* [[St. Bernard (dog)]]\n* [[Wilderness first aid]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*{{cite book|last=Scott-Nash|first=Mark|title=Playing for Real: Stories from Rocky Mountain Rescue|publisher=The Colorado Mountain Club Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|date=2007|isbn=0-9760525-6-3}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Mountain rescue}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.ikar-cisa.org|title=IKAR-CISA|work=ikar-cisa.org|publisher=IKAR-CISA|accessdate=24 January 2010}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.mra.org/drupal2/|title=Mountain Rescue Association|work=mra.org|publisher=Mountain Rescue Association|accessdate=24 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211140035/http://www.mra.org/drupal2/|archive-date=11 February 2010|url-status=dead}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.pmru.org/|title=Portland Mountain Rescue|work=pmru.org|publisher=Portland Mountain Rescue|accessdate=20 February 2013}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.mountain.rescue.org.uk/|title=Mountain Rescue England & Wales|work=mountain.rescue.org|publisher=Mountain Rescue England & Wales|accessdate=24 January 2010}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainrescue.ie|title=Mountain Rescue Ireland|work=mountainrescue.ie|publisher=Mountain Rescue Ireland|accessdate=24 January 2010}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090501044124/http://www.navsar.org/ NAVSAR] National Association of Volunteer Search and Rescue Teams\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.rockymountainrescue.org/index.php|title=Rocky Mountain Rescue Group|work=rockymountainrescue.org|publisher=Rocky Mountain Rescue Group|accessdate=24 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514093644/http://www.rockymountainrescue.org/index.php|archivedate=14 May 2011}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.santafesar.org/|title=Santa Fe Search and Rescue Group|work=santafesar.org|publisher=Santa Fe Search and Rescue Group|accessdate=24 January 2010}}\n* [http://www.everettmountainrescue.org Everett Mountain Rescue]\n* [http://www.seattlemountainrescue.org Seattle Mountain Rescue]\n* [http://www.parksmountainsafety.ca Parks Canada Mountain Safety Webpage]\n* [http://www.sardogsnepal.asia/ SARDOGS NEPAL.Search and Rescue Dog Handlers Academy]\n* [http://www.njsar.org New Jersey Search and Rescue]\n* [http://www.marinsar.org Northern California's Marin County Search & Rescue]\n* [http://www.lamrt.org.uk/ Langdale/Ambleside MRT]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20200313025524/https://www.nsp.org/ National Ski Patrol]\n* [http://www.pspa.org Professional Ski Patrol Association]\n* [http://www.gss.rs Serbian Mountain Rescue Service]\n* [https://www.guidedolomiti.com/en/dolomites-mountain-rescue/ Guide Dolomiti]\n* [http://sbcsar.net Santa Barbara County Search and Rescue].

Most of the rescue are operated by [[Rega (air rescue)|Swiss Air-Rescue Rega]] ({{lang-de|Schweizerische Rettungsflugwacht}}, {{lang-fr|Garde a\u00e9rienne suisse de sauvetage, Rega}}), a non-profit organisation that provide alpine rescue with its fleet of 17 medical helicopters, including 11 Agusta A109 SP Grand \"Da Vinci\", used both in ground support of paramedical personnel and frontline alpine rescue. \nSwiss Air-Rescue Rega has two very distinctive characteristics: they can reach any place in Switzerland under 15 minutes, due to their ten bases, and they are medicalized. This means an emergency physician (mostly an anesthesist) will be on the flight to provide advanced treatment.\n\nThe Swiss canton of Valais doesn't use Rega, they have their own rescue fleet, named Air Glacier and Air Zermatt. They have similar colours, procedures and personnel.\n\nThe Swiss army is also used in frontline rescue of civilians. Their many mountain battalions are commonly used in collaboration with the Rega, due to their manpower, heavy equipment and proven experience of collaboration with civilian authorities.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{main|Mountain rescue in England and Wales|Mountain Rescue Committee of Scotland}}\n[[File:Stretcher Box at Styhead - geograph.org.uk - 730830.jpg|thumb|Stretcher box in Cumbria, England, prepositioned equipment saves mountain rescue teams having to trudge up mountains with it.]]\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], mountain rescue is mostly a free service, provided by volunteers. Each team is an independent charity, and are linked together by regional organizations and national bodies.

[[Prince William]] is the patron of MREW. Mountain rescue services are also provided by the [[Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service]] (RAFMRS).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/rafsearchandrescue/operations/mrs.cfm|title=RAF - MRS|first=RAF Details|last=here|website=www.raf.mod.uk|accessdate=11 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/rafsearchandrescue/operations/mrs70th.cfm|title=RAF - MRS 70th Anniversary|first=RAF Details|last=here|website=www.raf.mod.uk|accessdate=11 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n\n{{main|Mountain rescue in the United States}}\n\nIn the United States, mountain search and rescue is a technical specialty within general search and rescue. It is handled by 'career, on-duty and on-call paid' teams within the national parks, and supplemented by other paid and volunteer assets/resources as needed. For areas outside the national parks, there are approximately 20 agencies, mostly sheriff's departments, in the U.S. which provide paid or career members of a mountain SAR team. Most of those supplement with volunteer professionals. The bulk of mountain SAR operations in the U.S. are provided by 'volunteer professional' teams (are not career positions or paid but must meet minimum industry-accepted standards at or above their paid counterparts), who may also respond via mutual aid or automatic aid to incidents out-of-county, out-of-state and into national parks, via intrastate, interstate, and national park agreements, as well as via the FEMA NIMS national mutual aid deployment system.\nParks with paid teams include [[Denali National Park]], [[Yosemite National Park]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/sar/index.htm|title=Yosemite National Park: YOSAR|work=nps.gov|publisher=United States National Park Service|accessdate=24 January 2010}}</ref> [[Grand Teton National Park]], and [[Mount Rainier National Park]]. Many paid and volunteer professional mountain SAR teams are part of the [[Mountain rescue in the United States#Mountain Rescue Association|Mountain Rescue Association]] (MRA) and operate under the authority of the local sheriff's department (approximately 42 of the 50 states) or state police or emergency management agency. While teams are primarily responsible to operate in one county which could be from 50 square miles to 20,000 square miles, they typically respond to adjoining counties and states.\nUnder the [[National Incident Management System]], mountain rescue unit qualifications are standardized for those units which choose to be deployable for national disasters and national mutual aid outside their jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/emergency/usr/mountain_sar_team.htm|title=Resource: Mountain Search and Rescue Team|work=fema.gov|publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency|accessdate=25 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125155741/http://www.fema.gov/emergency/usr/mountain_sar_team.htm|archivedate=25 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Helicopter rescue basket]]\n* [[SAR dog]]\n* [[St. Bernard (dog)]]\n* [[Wilderness first aid]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*{{cite book|last=Scott-Nash|first=Mark|title=Playing for Real: Stories from Rocky Mountain Rescue|publisher=The Colorado Mountain Club Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|date=2007|isbn=0-9760525-6-3}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Mountain rescue}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.ikar-cisa.org|title=IKAR-CISA|work=ikar-cisa.org|publisher=IKAR-CISA|accessdate=24 January 2010}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.mra.org/drupal2/|title=Mountain Rescue Association|work=mra.org|publisher=Mountain Rescue Association|accessdate=24 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211140035/http://www.mra.org/drupal2/|archive-date=11 February 2010|url-status=dead}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.pmru.org/|title=Portland Mountain Rescue|work=pmru.org|publisher=Portland Mountain Rescue|accessdate=20 February 2013}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.mountain.rescue.org.uk/|title=Mountain Rescue England & Wales|work=mountain.rescue.org|publisher=Mountain Rescue England & Wales|accessdate=24 January 2010}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainrescue.ie|title=Mountain Rescue Ireland|work=mountainrescue.ie|publisher=Mountain Rescue Ireland|accessdate=24 January 2010}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090501044124/http://www.navsar.org/ NAVSAR] National Association of Volunteer Search and Rescue Teams\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.rockymountainrescue.org/index.php|title=Rocky Mountain Rescue Group|work=rockymountainrescue.org|publisher=Rocky Mountain Rescue Group|accessdate=24 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514093644/http://www.rockymountainrescue.org/index.php|archivedate=14 May 2011}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.santafesar.org/|title=Santa Fe Search and Rescue Group|work=santafesar.org|publisher=Santa Fe Search and Rescue Group|accessdate=24 January 2010}}\n* [http://www.everettmountainrescue.org Everett Mountain Rescue]\n* [http://www.seattlemountainrescue.org Seattle Mountain Rescue]\n* [http://www.parksmountainsafety.ca Parks Canada Mountain Safety Webpage]\n* [http://www.sardogsnepal.asia/ SARDOGS NEPAL.Search and Rescue Dog Handlers Academy]\n* [http://www.njsar.org New Jersey Search and Rescue]\n* [http://www.marinsar.org Northern California's Marin County Search & Rescue]\n* [http://www.lamrt.org.uk/ Langdale/Ambleside MRT]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20200313025524/https://www.nsp.org/ National Ski Patrol]\n* [http://www.pspa.org Professional Ski Patrol Association]\n* [http://www.gss.rs Serbian Mountain Rescue Service]\n* [https://www.guidedolomiti.com/en/dolomites-mountain-rescue/ Guide Dolomiti]\n* [http://sbcsar.net Santa Barbara County Search and Rescue].

K\u014dya is primarily known as the world headquarters of the K\u014dyasan [[Shingon]] sect of [[Japanese Buddhism]].  Located on an 800 m high plain amid eight peaks of the mountain (which was the reason this location was selected, in that the terrain is supposed to resemble a lotus plant), the original [[monastery]] has grown into the town of [[K\u014dya, Wakayama|K\u014dya]], featuring a university dedicated to religious studies and 120 sub-temples, many of which offer lodging to pilgrims.  The mountain is home to the following famous sites:\n* {{Nihongo|''[[Kong\u014dbu-ji]]''|\u91d1\u525b\u5cef\u5bfa}}, the head temple of the K\u014dyasan Shingon Buddhism.

Hamilton just across Smith Creek in 1895, Courtesy of San Jose Public Library, California Room]]\nOn August 26, 1861, while working for [[Josiah Whitney|Josiah D. Whitney]] on the first [[California Geological Survey]], [[William Henry Brewer|William H. Brewer]] invited local [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] [[preacher]] (and Brewer's personal friend) [[Laurentine Hamilton]] to join his company on a [[hiking|trek]] to a nearby [[Topographical summit|summit]].  Nearing completion of their journey, Hamilton, in good humor, bounded for the summit ahead of the rest of the men and claimed his stake.  In fact, Brewer suggested the mountain be named after Hamilton, only after Whitney declined to have the mountain named after him (a different mountain was later named [[Mount Whitney]]).\n\nThe Spanish name for Mt.

On a clear day at the summit it is possible to see the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].\n[[Image:Mt hamilton road cyclist.jpg|thumb|left|Mt. Hamilton Road is popular with cycling clubs.]]\n\nCyclists commonly use the road because of the long but not overly challenging nature of the climb, sparse vehicular traffic over most of its length,{{fact|date=December 2017}} and the views of San Jose and the [[Santa Clara Valley]] below.  There is an annual cycling challenge climb in April.<ref>\n  {{cite web\n  | url = http://www.hillsidegraphics.com/hamilton-challenge/\n  | title = Mt.

Hamilton Road (part of [[California State Route 130|State Route 130]]) is commonly used by [[bicyclist]]s and motorcyclists. Built in 1875\u201376 in anticipation of the observatory, and the need to carry materials and equipment up the mountain in horse-drawn wagons, the grade seldom exceeds 6.5&nbsp;percent. The road rises over {{convert|4000|ft}} in three long climbs from San Jose to the mountain top.    On a clear day at the summit it is possible to see the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].\n[[Image:Mt hamilton road cyclist.jpg|thumb|left|Mt. Hamilton Road is popular with cycling clubs.]]\n\nCyclists commonly use the road because of the long but not overly challenging nature of the climb, sparse vehicular traffic over most of its length,{{fact|date=December 2017}} and the views of San Jose and the [[Santa Clara Valley]] below.  There is an annual cycling challenge climb in April.<ref>\n  {{cite web\n  | url = http://www.hillsidegraphics.com/hamilton-challenge/\n  | title = Mt.

The upward trek is interrupted by two descents, first into [[Grant Ranch County Park]], and again to cross Smith Creek.

The main observatory building offers free 15-minute guided tours of the [[James Lick telescope|Great Lick refracting telescope]].{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n== Geology and hydrology ==\nMuch of the foothill slopes of Mount Hamilton is underlain by [[Miocene]] age [[sandstone]] of the Briones formation: this [[bedrock]] is locally soft and weathered in the upper few feet, but grades locally to very hard at depth.  Depth to [[groundwater]] on these foothill areas of Mount Hamilton is approximately {{convert|240|ft|m}}.<ref>C.

Under the guidance of [[Brian McClennan]] they were the most successful club in the competition's history, being champions three times and twice winning the minor premiership. However the club had a slow start to the competition, not making the playoffs in the first two years. Their place in the Bartercard Cup was taken over by the [[Auckland Lions]], an entity which represented Mount Albert as well as other neighbouring clubs. In 2007 the Auckland Lions also competed in the [[NSWRL Premier League]] but they were replaced in 2008 by the [[Auckland Vulcans]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=30 |Season\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points for\" |PF\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points against\" |PA\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points difference\" |PD\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n!width=150 |Position (Teams)\n!width=250 |Finals\n|- \n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[2000 Bartercard Cup|2000]]\n|22||12||1||9||593||584||9||'''25''' ||Sixth (Twelve)||N/A\n|- \n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[2001 Bartercard Cup|2001]]\n|21||8||0||13||414||630||-216||'''18*'''||Tenth (Twelve)||N/A\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[2002 Bartercard Cup|2002]]\n|16||15||0||1||620||270||350||'''30''' ||Minor Premiers (Twelve)||'''Champions'''\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[2003 Bartercard Cup|2003]]\n|16||13||0||3||530||328||202||'''26''' ||Second (Twelve)||Defeated in Preliminary Final\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[2004 Bartercard Cup|2004]]\n|16||12||0||4||522||378||144||'''24'''||Third (Twelve)||'''Champions'''\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[2005 Bartercard Cup|2005]]\n|16||12||0||4||570||326||244||'''24''' ||Minor Premiers (Twelve)||'''Champions'''\n|}\n\n<nowiki> *Two points for a Bye as the Ngongotaha Chiefs withdrew from the competition </nowiki>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.mtalbertlions.co.nz/ Official Club Website]\n*[http://www.nzrl.co.nz/page/mt_albert_lions.html Mount Albert's NZRL Page]\n\n{{Rugby League in Auckland}}\n{{OldBartercard}}\n\n[[Category:Mount Albert Lions]]\n[[Category:Rugby clubs established in 1927]]\n[[Category:1927 establishments in New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Albert_Lions"}

Even then the rider must be at least 14 years of age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/603646/eapc-e-bike-qualification-guidance.pdf|title=EAPC Rules}}</ref>\n\nIn theory, it would be legal to ride any motorized scooter if the rider possessed a category AM UK driving license (for Mopeds) plus number plates; insurance; test certificate; road tax; crash helmet etc. In practice, it remains illegal because a motorized scooter will not meet the requirements of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, so they can only be used on private land.\n\nOn 12 July 2019 the first UK fatality involving an e-scooter occurred. A 35-year-old YouTube personality, [[Emily Hartridge]], was killed in [[Battersea]], [[London]] in a collision on a roundabout with a truck. London's cycling commissioner said that \"new regulations must be put forward quickly\" as e-scooters are \"currently not safe \u2013 with no restrictions on speeds, no mandatory brakes and lights, and no rules on who can ride them and where\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-49002636 |title=E-scooter crashes spark call for new rules |date=16 July 2019 |website=www.bbc.co.uk |access-date=23 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Other regions===\n\n====Australia====\nIn Queensland, the laws around the use of electric scooters and other personal mobility devices are made and enforced by the state government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/wheeled-devices/personal-mobility-devices|title=Rules for personal mobility devices {{!}} Bicycles, skateboards, foot scooters and similar|last=Queensland;|first=c=AU; o=The State of|website=www.qld.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref><ref>https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/wheeled%20-devices%20/%20personal-mobility-devices{{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile some local governments in Queensland have not allowed Lime scooter trials, Brisbane City Council is currently undertaking a Lime Scooter trial and has invited tenders for two scooter contracts in the city.\n\nIn the ACT, the framework for personal mobility devices was amended to include e-scooters and other similar devices from 20 December 2019, permitting use on footpaths, shared paths, bicycle paths and the bicycle side of separated paths. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/1881/~/personal-mobility-device-use-in-the-act|title=Personal mobility device use in the ACT|last=Canberra|first=Access Canberra; PositionTitle=Manager; SectionName=Access Canberra; CorporateName=Access|website=www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>\n\n====New Zealand====\nElectric scooters in New Zealand are classed as a 'Low-powered vehicle that does not require registration', provided that the output power is under 300 watts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Low-powered vehicles |url=https://www.nzta.govt.nz/vehicles/vehicle-types/low-powered-vehicles/ |website=New Zealand Transport Agency |accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> They can therefore be ridden on footpaths, roads and separated cycleways. They cannot be ridden on paint-defined cycleways on the road. Helmets are not legally required, but recommended.\n\n====United States====\nIn many areas in the United States, motorized scooters are not [[Street-legal vehicle|street legal]], as they cannot be tagged, titled, insured, and do not meet federal requirements for lights or mirrors. Particular localities may have further ordinances that limit the use of motorized scooters. The top speed of the average motorized scooter is around 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour). Due to their small wheels, motorized scooters are not typically safe for street use as even the smallest bumps can cause an accident.\n\nCalifornia requires that a person riding a motorized scooter on a street be 16 years of age or older, have a valid driver's license, be wearing a bicycle helmet, have no passengers, and otherwise follow the same rules of the road the same as cars do. The motorized scooter must have brakes, may not have handlebars raised above the operator's shoulders, and if ridden at night must have a headlight, a taillight, and side reflectors. A motorized scooter may not be operated on sidewalks or on streets if the posted speed limit is over 25&nbsp;mph (40&nbsp;km/h) unless in a Class II bicycle lane.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.brea.ca.us/article.cfm?id=1272 |title=Scooter and Go-Ped Guidelines |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311235350/http://www.ci.brea.ca.us/article.cfm?id=1272 |archivedate=2011-03-11 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>\n\nMichigan laws treat motorized scooters similarly to bicycles.

This means there is no inspection, license, insurance, or registration required. Additionally, this means that motorized scooters are allowed on the sidewalks, and helmets are not required.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dmv.dc.gov/publication/non-traditional-motor-vehicles-and-dc-law |title=Non-Traditional Motor Vehicles and DC Law {{!}} dmv |website=dmv.dc.gov |access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref>\n\nIn Atlanta, motorized scooters are considered Electric Personal Assistive Mobility Devices, meaning they can be used on sidewalks and highways where the speed limit is at most 35 miles per hour, or in the bike lane. The law also specifies that users of Electric Personal Assistive Mobility Devices, including motorized scooter riders, \"have the same rights and duties as prescribed for pedestrians\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dps.georgia.gov/georgia-code-low-speed-vehicles |title=Georgia Code: Low Speed Vehicles {{!}} Georgia Department of Public Safety |website=dps.georgia.gov |access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n\nScooter sharing companies have rules for operation printed on both the scooter and in the app, which includes instructions to not ride on the sidewalk. Given that the laws regarding motorized scooters vary from state to state, the scooter sharing instructions can differ from the local law.\n\n==Mechanics==\n===Wheels and tires===\nThere are two general categories of tires on which stand-up scooters travel\u2014hard tires and air tires. Hard tires are generally {{convert|6|in|mm}} in diameter and constructed of a hard-plastic insert surrounded by a solid rubber tire. Air tires are most often {{convert|10|in|mm}} in diameter. They are constructed of a steel or aluminum split rim, an [[inner tube]] and rubber tire. Other, less common wheel and tire types include {{convert|8|in|mm}} and {{convert|13|in|mm}} air tires.\n\n===Transmissions===\nThe most simplistic drive mechanism of stand-up scooters is the \"spindle\" drive. This drive mechanism puts an extension of the engine's output shaft, the spindle, in direct contact with the rear tire of the scooter. In order to function correctly, the tire must have a clean, dry surface which the spindle will be able to effectively interact with. Scooters with this type of direct transmission can be pull-started with the rear wheel off the ground, or [[bump start|\"bump\"-started]] by forcefully pushing the scooter with the rear tire in contact with the ground. [[File:T3_Patroller_electric_stand-up_trike.jpg|thumb|upright|T3 Patroller electric stand-up [[tricycle]]]]\n\nSimple [[chain drive|chain reduction drives]] are also used to transfer energy to the rear wheel from the engine.  These generally incorporate a type of [[centrifugal clutch]] to allow the engine to idle independently.\n\n[[Belt (mechanical)|Belt]] reduction drives use the combination of wide flat \"cog\" belts and pulleys to transfer power to the rear wheel. Like chain drives, belt drives include a centrifugal clutch. Belt drives are more susceptible to breakage in off-road conditions.\n\n===Suspension===\nThe suspension systems of stand-up scooters range from simplistic spring based [[Suspension fork|fork systems]] to the complicated, dampened cam-link and C.I.D.L.I<ref>Cantilevered Independent Dynamic Linkless Indespension</ref> suspension mechanisms or a hybrid combination of wooden deck, coil spring, and dampers.\n\n=== Brakes ===\nBrake systems of kick scooters can range from [[Disc Brake]] system, [[Magnetic braking|magnetic brake]] (used for energy consumption), or the less efficient [[Hydraulic brake|Hydraulic Brakes]], where brakes can be placed on either -or both- the front and back wheel(s). Many newer models of e-scooter also have Kinetic Energy Regeneration System (KERS), which also acts as an E-ABS on many models.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{gallery\n|File:Scooters.Assisi028.jpg|Photo on exhibition in the private scootermuseum, Assisi, Italy\n|File:Austro Motorette 82 cc two stroke 1922.jpg|1922 Austro Motorette 82 cc two stroke\n|File:Gsr40.jpg|Example of a Go-Ped.|File:ZUKBOARD CITY.jpg|Zukboard City\n\n}}\n\n==Companies==\n{{expand list|date=September 2019}}\n* Unagi Scooters\n*[[Lime (transportation company)]]\n* [[Razor (scooter)|Razor]]\n* [[Segway Inc.]] / Ninebot \n* [[Xiaomi]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Motorized kick scooters}}\n* [[Scooter-sharing system]]\n* [[Bicycle-sharing system]]\n* [[Segway PT]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Motor scooters| ]]\n[[Category:Personal transporters]]\n\n[[fr:Trottinette \u00e9lectrique]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|powered scooters ridden standing up|scooters with seats|Scooter (motorcycle)|other uses|Scooter (disambiguation){{!}}Scooter}}\n[[File:An electric kick scooter in Germany .jpg|thumb|An electric scooter]]\n[[File:Vosh, Stockholm ( 1090722).jpg|thumb|Scooters of several operators in Stockholm]]\nA '''motorized scooter''' is a powered stand-up [[Kick scooter|scooter]] using a small utility [[internal combustion engine]] or, more commonly, an [[electric motor]].

Paris Deputy Mayor Christophe Najdovski is lobbying Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne for a clearer framework that would give municipalities the power to tighten the rules on how permits are issued and how authorizations are given to deploy a fleet of electric scooters to operators.<ref name=\"politico.eu\">{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/escooters-test-europe-antiquated-traffic-rules/ |title=E-scooters test Europe's old traffic rules |date=12 January 2019 |website=www.politico.eu |access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nFrench daily newspaper ''[[Le Parisien]]'' found that in 2017, electric scooters and roller skates combined caused 284 injuries and five deaths in France, a 23 percent increase on the previous year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/societe/les-accidents-de-trottinettes-en-forte-hausse-10-10-2018-7916037.php |title=Les Accidents de Trottinettes en Forte Hausse |date=11 October 2018 |website=www.leparisien.fr |access-date=24 April 2019 |language=fr}}</ref> The perception of electric scooters is that they are fast, silent and therefore dangerous, causing many accidents, and the need to legislate is urgent.<ref name=\"politico.eu\"/>\n\n====Germany====\nIn April 2019, the \"electric propulsion vehicles without seats\" and mono-wheels were added to the regulatory list of vehicles allowed to circulate in the streets.

According to the Road Traffic Act 1961, all electric scooters are considered to be \"mechanically propelled vehicles\". Anyone using a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place must have insurance, road tax, and a driving license. However, it is currently not possible to tax or insure e-scooters or electric skateboards.\n\nIn March 2019, electric scooter owners started reporting that the Irish police force, the [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na]], had begun regularly seizing electric scooters on the grounds that the owner did not have insurance.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gardai-confiscate-electric-scooters-because-law-is-vague-owners-claim-5jjwwl3px |title=Garda\u00ed confiscate electric scooters |date=23 April 2019 |website=www.thetimes.co.uk |access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref> The owner groups, such as eScoot.ie, have been publicly vocal, attracting media attention and urging electric scooter owners to sign a petition for lawmakers to legalize the public use of \"electric rideables\" in Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.escoot.ie/legalization-of-escooters-in-ireland/ |title=Petition to legalize the public use of electric rideables in Ireland |date=19 April 2019 |website=www.escoot.ie |access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref> Under growing pressure, the Minister for Transport [[Shane Ross]] asked the [[Road Safety Authority]] to research how e-scooters are regulated in other countries, particularly other EU member states.

Therefore, such vehicles are not allowed to ride on the sidewalks as well as bicycle lanes. However, due to the lack of homologation, it is not possible to register electric scooter as a road vehicle, which makes it illegal for the use on the road. The legislators are now working on changes to the law to introduce the definition of the Personal Transport Device, which would allow electric scooters to be used on the sidewalks and bicycle lanes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.prawodrogowe.pl/informacje/kronika-legislacyjna/urzadzenia-transportu-osobistego-czekalismy-na-odpowiedz-resortu |title=zenia transportu osobistego.

A 35-year-old YouTube personality, [[Emily Hartridge]], was killed in [[Battersea]], [[London]] in a collision on a roundabout with a truck. London's cycling commissioner said that \"new regulations must be put forward quickly\" as e-scooters are \"currently not safe \u2013 with no restrictions on speeds, no mandatory brakes and lights, and no rules on who can ride them and where\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-49002636 |title=E-scooter crashes spark call for new rules |date=16 July 2019 |website=www.bbc.co.uk |access-date=23 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Other regions===\n\n====Australia====\nIn Queensland, the laws around the use of electric scooters and other personal mobility devices are made and enforced by the state government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/wheeled-devices/personal-mobility-devices|title=Rules for personal mobility devices {{!}} Bicycles, skateboards, foot scooters and similar|last=Queensland;|first=c=AU; o=The State of|website=www.qld.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref><ref>https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/wheeled%20-devices%20/%20personal-mobility-devices{{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile some local governments in Queensland have not allowed Lime scooter trials, Brisbane City Council is currently undertaking a Lime Scooter trial and has invited tenders for two scooter contracts in the city.\n\nIn the ACT, the framework for personal mobility devices was amended to include e-scooters and other similar devices from 20 December 2019, permitting use on footpaths, shared paths, bicycle paths and the bicycle side of separated paths. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/1881/~/personal-mobility-device-use-in-the-act|title=Personal mobility device use in the ACT|last=Canberra|first=Access Canberra; PositionTitle=Manager; SectionName=Access Canberra; CorporateName=Access|website=www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>\n\n====New Zealand====\nElectric scooters in New Zealand are classed as a 'Low-powered vehicle that does not require registration', provided that the output power is under 300 watts<ref>{{cite web |title=Low-powered vehicles |url=https://www.nzta.govt.nz/vehicles/vehicle-types/low-powered-vehicles/ |website=New Zealand Transport Agency |accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref>. They can therefore be ridden on footpaths, roads and separated cycleways. They cannot be ridden on paint-defined cycleways on the road. Helmets are not legally required, but recommended.\n\n====United States====\nIn many areas in the United States, motorized scooters are not [[Street-legal vehicle|street legal]], as they cannot be tagged, titled, insured, and do not meet federal requirements for lights or mirrors. Particular localities may have further ordinances that limit the use of motorized scooters. The top speed of the average motorized scooter is around 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour). Due to their small wheels, motorized scooters are not typically safe for street use as even the smallest bumps can cause an accident.\n\nCalifornia requires that a person riding a motorized scooter on a street be 16 years of age or older, have a valid driver's license, be wearing a bicycle helmet, have no passengers, and otherwise follow the same rules of the road the same as cars do. The motorized scooter must have brakes, may not have handlebars raised above the operator's shoulders, and if ridden at night must have a headlight, a taillight, and side reflectors. A motorized scooter may not be operated on sidewalks or on streets if the posted speed limit is over 25&nbsp;mph (40&nbsp;km/h) unless in a Class II bicycle lane.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.brea.ca.us/article.cfm?id=1272 |title=Scooter and Go-Ped Guidelines |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311235350/http://www.ci.brea.ca.us/article.cfm?id=1272 |archivedate=2011-03-11 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>\n\nMichigan laws treat motorized scooters similarly to bicycles.

This means there is no inspection, license, insurance, or registration required. Additionally, this means that motorized scooters are allowed on the sidewalks, and helmets are not required.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dmv.dc.gov/publication/non-traditional-motor-vehicles-and-dc-law |title=Non-Traditional Motor Vehicles and DC Law {{!}} dmv |website=dmv.dc.gov |access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref>\n\nIn Atlanta, motorized scooters are considered Electric Personal Assistive Mobility Devices, meaning they can be used on sidewalks and highways where the speed limit is at most 35 miles per hour, or in the bike lane. The law also specifies that users of Electric Personal Assistive Mobility Devices, including motorized scooter riders, \"have the same rights and duties as prescribed for pedestrians\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dps.georgia.gov/georgia-code-low-speed-vehicles |title=Georgia Code: Low Speed Vehicles {{!}} Georgia Department of Public Safety |website=dps.georgia.gov |access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n\nScooter sharing companies have rules for operation printed on both the scooter and in the app, which includes instructions to not ride on the sidewalk. Given that the laws regarding motorized scooters vary from state to state, the scooter sharing instructions can differ from the local law.\n\n==Mechanics==\n===Wheels and tires===\nThere are two general categories of tires on which stand-up scooters travel\u2014hard tires and air tires. Hard tires are generally {{convert|6|in|mm}} in diameter and constructed of a hard-plastic insert surrounded by a solid rubber tire. Air tires are most often {{convert|10|in|mm}} in diameter. They are constructed of a steel or aluminum split rim, an [[inner tube]] and rubber tire. Other, less common wheel and tire types include {{convert|8|in|mm}} and {{convert|13|in|mm}} air tires.\n\n===Transmissions===\nThe most simplistic drive mechanism of stand-up scooters is the \"spindle\" drive. This drive mechanism puts an extension of the engine's output shaft, the spindle, in direct contact with the rear tire of the scooter. In order to function correctly, the tire must have a clean, dry surface which the spindle will be able to effectively interact with. Scooters with this type of direct transmission can be pull-started with the rear wheel off the ground, or [[bump start|\"bump\"-started]] by forcefully pushing the scooter with the rear tire in contact with the ground. [[File:T3_Patroller_electric_stand-up_trike.jpg|thumb|upright|T3 Patroller electric stand-up [[tricycle]]]]\n\nSimple [[chain drive|chain reduction drives]] are also used to transfer energy to the rear wheel from the engine.  These generally incorporate a type of [[centrifugal clutch]] to allow the engine to idle independently.\n\n[[Belt (mechanical)|Belt]] reduction drives use the combination of wide flat \"cog\" belts and pulleys to transfer power to the rear wheel. Like chain drives, belt drives include a centrifugal clutch. Belt drives are more susceptible to breakage in off-road conditions.\n\n===Suspension===\nThe suspension systems of stand-up scooters range from simplistic spring based [[Suspension fork|fork systems]] to the complicated, dampened cam-link and C.I.D.L.I<ref>Cantilevered Independent Dynamic Linkless Indespension</ref> suspension mechanisms or a hybrid combination of wooden deck, coil spring, and dampers.\n\n=== Brakes ===\nBrake systems of kick scooters can range from [[Disc Brake]] system, [[Magnetic braking|magnetic brake]] (used for energy consumption), or the less efficient [[Hydraulic brake|Hydraulic Brakes]], where brakes can be placed on either -or both- the front and back wheel(s). Many newer models of e-scooter also have Kinetic Energy Regeneration System (KERS), which also acts as an E-ABS on many models.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{gallery\n|File:Scooters.Assisi028.jpg|Photo on exhibition in the private scootermuseum, Assisi, Italy\n|File:Austro Motorette 82 cc two stroke 1922.jpg|1922 Austro Motorette 82 cc two stroke\n|File:Gsr40.jpg|Example of a Go-Ped.|File:ZUKBOARD CITY.jpg|Zukboard City\n\n}}\n\n==Companies==\n{{expand list|date=September 2019}}\n* Unagi Scooters\n*[[Lime (transportation company)]]\n* [[Razor (scooter)|Razor]]\n* [[Segway Inc.]] / Ninebot \n* [[Xiaomi]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Motorized kick scooters}}\n* [[Scooter-sharing system]]\n* [[Bicycle-sharing system]]\n* [[Segway PT]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Motor scooters| ]]\n[[Category:Personal transporters]]\n\n[[fr:Trottinette \u00e9lectrique]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorized_scooter"}

The stadium serves as a home to the [[Nigerian national football team]], as well as a center for various social, cultural, and religious events. The Federal Government of Nigeria approved the contract for the construction of the National Stadium complex and Games Village on 18 July 2000. The stadium was constructed to host the [[2003 All-Africa Games|8th All Africa Games]] which took place in October 2003. On 12 June 2019, President [[Muhammadu Buhari]] announced the change of the name of the National Stadium, Abuja to Moshood Abiola National Stadium.

The main characteristics are the two overlapping spectator tiers; the lower tier accommodating 32,000 seats and the upper tier 28,000 seats. The lower tier also incorporates 56 corporate suites with viewing terraces and one presidential lounge for 50 guests. All functional and secondary areas are accommodated in the entrance building which provides a gross floor area of approximately 25,000 m\u00b2. This building is arranged below the concourse level which serves as the spectators\u2018 distribution level and therefore provides several kiosks, banks, first aid stations and toilet buildings. The structure of the stadium is a combination of insitu and precast concrete elements. There are 36 towers supporting the upper tier and the roof structure. These towers are founded on 140 bored piles with diameters of 1.30 m and 1.50 m in a depth of 8.00 m to 30.00 m. Precast concrete elements varying between 13 and 15 meters in length are placed between the towers, forming the spectator stands. A total of 6,300 precast elements were produced in the company\u2019s production yard 15 kilometers away. The towers are connected on the top by a 2.50 m high and 2.00 m wide hollow concrete ring beam with a wall thickness of 0.35 m. The roof structure is fixed on 36 massive concrete points to the ring-beam. For the first time in the world, the ringbeam for this kind of roof structure was made of concrete. The roof structure itself is a cable construction with a weight of 800 tons carrying a 28.000 m\u00b2 membrane.\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:Abuja Stadium 6.jpg|thumb|190px|External view]]\nAll facilities within the stadium are designed and engineered in compliance with the requirements of international sport associations, particularly the [[FIFA|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA) and the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF).\n\nThe complex includes:\n*60,491 capacity covered main bowl\n*Presidential suite and viewing area\n*56 corporate suites\n*Post offices\n*Banks\n*Media facilities\n*Two scoreboards and floodlights\n*Shops and kiosks for snacks\n*Helipad\n*3000 capacity indoor sports hall\n*2000 capacity gymnasi* 2000 capacity swimming pool\n*Tennis Courts\n*3000 capacity hockey stadium\n*Baseball and softball complex\n\nMoshood Abiola National Stadium meets the requirements of the International safety standards; it is equipped with emergency service units, closed circuit security cameras as well as crowd control steel fencing. There are also stand-by fire fighting equipment and metal detectors which have been put in place to avoid any misfortunes.\n\n==History of the Stadium==\nAlthough Nigeria had several stadiums scattered throughout the country, there was a lack of stadiums that met international standards. The capital city of Nigeria, Abuja, was selected to host the 8th All Africa Games in 2000 (a regional multi-sport event held every four years, organized by the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa) despite having no facilities for  such a major sporting event. The Federal Government of Nigeria embarked on a multimillion-dollar project for the construction of a state-of-the-art stadium and games village to be completed in time to host the All Africa Games. The contract was awarded on 18 July 2000 from a choice list of about 80 different bidders. Construction of the complex was initiated.\n\nCitizens and athletes had doubts as to whether the completion of the stadium was feasible before the games. However, construction went very smoothly and ended up being ahead of schedule. As a matter of fact, the stadium was scheduled to be the host center for the [[Miss World]] [[Beauty Contest|Beauty Pageant]] that took place later in 2002. Unfortunately, the stadium not being fully completed by then as well as an uprising amongst citizens especially in the northern city of [[Kaduna]] which resulted in loss of lives forced the pageant to relocate to [[London]], [[England]]. The construction of the main bowl went on from its inception in September 2000 to its completion in April 2003, well in time for the games. The Games Village construction went on from September 2000 to August 2003.\n\nThe official commissioning of the complex was on 8 April 2003. Following its commissioning was the final leg of preparations for the games. The games that year were the largest in All Africa Games history;<ref>\"8th All Africa Games.\" ''2K+ International Sports Media.'' Retrieved 30 October 2006</ref> 6,000 athletes from 53 countries competed in 22 sports, watched over by 1,200 officials. Over 1,500 journalists reported for the world's media. The games took place from the 4th to 18 October 2003 and was deemed successful by many. The host country, Nigeria, accumulated a total of 226 medals, emerging as leader of the games that year.\n\nApart from the All African Games, the stadium has hosted important football matches, such as World Cup qualifiers between Nigeria and other countries. The first game played at the stadium was a football (soccer) match between two local rival teams; the Shooting Stars of [[Ibadan]] and Sunshine Stars of [[Akure]] on 8 April 2003<ref>\"Nigeria; Who Will Score First International Goal at Abuja Stadium?.\" ''VANGUARD Newspapers'' 19 April 2003. Retrieved 30 October 2006</ref> The first goal scored in the complex was from Shooting Stars' striker Shakiru Lawal who scored the only goal of the game after just five minutes.\n\nThe complex has given the country confidence to bid for various up-coming international events. The Federation of International Volleyball (FIVB) has given the Nigeria Volleyball Federation (NVBF) the provisional hosting rights of the 2007 World Youth Championship because of the facilities the stadium has.\n\n==Other uses==\nApart from its function as a sports center, Moshood Abiola National Stadium serves as a home to cultural and religious events. Its capacity attracts various events such as concerts, and religious conferences, events which sometimes have preference over sports. Nigeria is a highly religious country with a population split almost equally between [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. Due to this fact, several religious events occur each year that attract a lot of citizens and require a large capacity arena. For example, in September 2006, the Nigeria Football Association was rendered helpless over the Presidency's preference of a religious event in the main bowl of the Moshood Abiola National Stadium to an international football match against Rwanda.\n\nSome citizens are however concerned about the use of the stadium for such large events. Similar events held at the Stadium in Lagos resulted in its demise. The management of the stadium, however, intends to keep these events coming. Cost of maintenance is an issue and renting out the facility for various events is a strategy that has been employed to cover these costs. There were no plans whatsoever by the former military ruler late general Sani Abacha to build a national stadium in Abuja as some people might think.\n\n==Maintenance==\nSeveral issues have risen concerning the maintenance of the sports complex. The [[National Stadium, Lagos|National Stadium]] in [[Lagos, Nigeria|Lagos]], the most populous and industrialized city in the country, was built for the [[1973 All-Africa Games]]. Though it initially was considered state-of-the-art, it today is considered below any standard facility-wise and environmental-wise. The Nigerian sports boss [[Amos Adamu]] advised the government to privatize the Abuja stadium immediately after the 2003 All-Africa Games in order to forestall the vandalisation typical of publicly owned buildings.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-22608356_ITM\n |title=COJA Boss Wants Abuja Stadium Sold.\n |date=4 March 2003\n |publisher=This Day (Nigeria)\n |accessdate=2009-09-18}}</ref>\n\nThe federal government of Nigeria, who owns 100% equity on the property at the moment, has faced a lot of antagonism both locally and internationally. The average estimate for annual maintenance since its inauguration has been about $7 million, a number considered high by many standards. Due to the high cost of maintenance, the federal government has been seeking options for privatization of the facility. Through the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), the Federal Government of Nigeria intends to grant a concession to a sole Concessionaire who will enter into an investment commitment, and essentially operate the stadium with a primary goal of generating revenue from the proceeds of sporting events, concerts, religious activities, corporate sponsorship, corporate advertising and other  promotional activities.\n\nThe Concessionaire has the choice of assuming the role of Facility Manager for the property encompassed in the National Stadium and the Indoor Sports Complex, or employ a firm to perform the task.

The stadium serves as a home to the [[Nigerian national football team]], as well as a center for various social, cultural, and religious events. The Federal Government of Nigeria approved the contract for the construction of the National Stadium complex and Games Village on 18 July 2000. The stadium was constructed to host the [[2003 All-Africa Games|8th All Africa Games]] which took place in October 2003. On 12 June 2019, President [[Muhammadu Buhari]] announced the change of the name of the National Stadium, Abuja to Moshood Abiola National Stadium. President Buhari made this pronouncement during his speech at the Democracy Day celebration on Wednesday at the Eagle Square, Abuja.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://punchng.com/just-in-buhari-names-abuja-national-stadium-after-mko-abiola/|title=Buhari names Abuja National Stadium after MKO Abiola|last=Published|website=Punch Newspapers|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref>\n\n==Construction and Architecture==\n[[File:Abuja Stadium 3.jpg|thumb|190px|Seats view of the stadium]]\nMoshood Abiola National Stadium is one of the 50 most expensive stadiums<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thesportmarket.biz/charts/stadiumstats/top50stadiums/ranktop.html |title=Top 50 Most Expensive Stadiums in the World (adjusted for inflation) |website=The Sport Market |accessdate=18 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730194811/http://www.thesportmarket.biz/charts/stadiumstats/top50stadiums/ranktop.html |archivedate=30 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ever built in the world.\n\n==Structure==\nMoshood Abiola National Stadium main bowl is designed to accommodate 60,491 spectator seats<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gus-ai.de/pdf/B177_AST-Stadion.pdf |title=National Stadium Complex, Abuja/Nigeria |website=GUS - Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Umweltplanung Stuttgart |language=de}}</ref> covered by a lightweight roof construction. The main characteristics are the two overlapping spectator tiers; the lower tier accommodating 32,000 seats and the upper tier 28,000 seats. The lower tier also incorporates 56 corporate suites with viewing terraces and one presidential lounge for 50 guests. All functional and secondary areas are accommodated in the entrance building which provides a gross floor area of approximately 25,000 m\u00b2. This building is arranged below the concourse level which serves as the spectators\u2018 distribution level and therefore provides several kiosks, banks, first aid stations and toilet buildings. The structure of the stadium is a combination of insitu and precast concrete elements. There are 36 towers supporting the upper tier and the roof structure. These towers are founded on 140 bored piles with diameters of 1.30 m and 1.50 m in a depth of 8.00 m to 30.00 m. Precast concrete elements varying between 13 and 15 meters in length are placed between the towers, forming the spectator stands. A total of 6,300 precast elements were produced in the company\u2019s production yard 15 kilometers away. The towers are connected on the top by a 2.50 m high and 2.00 m wide hollow concrete ring beam with a wall thickness of 0.35 m. The roof structure is fixed on 36 massive concrete points to the ring-beam. For the first time in the world, the ringbeam for this kind of roof structure was made of concrete. The roof structure itself is a cable construction with a weight of 800 tons carrying a 28.000 m\u00b2 membrane.\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:Abuja Stadium 6.jpg|thumb|190px|External view]]\nAll facilities within the stadium are designed and engineered in compliance with the requirements of international sport associations, particularly the [[FIFA|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA) and the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF).\n\nThe complex includes:\n*60,491 capacity covered main bowl\n*Presidential suite and viewing area\n*56 corporate suites\n*Post offices\n*Banks\n*Media facilities\n*Two scoreboards and floodlights\n*Shops and kiosks for snacks\n*Helipad\n*3000 capacity indoor sports hall\n*2000 capacity gymnasi* 2000 capacity swimming pool\n*Tennis Courts\n*3000 capacity hockey stadium\n*Baseball and softball complex\n\nMoshood Abiola National Stadium meets the requirements of the International safety standards; it is equipped with emergency service units, closed circuit security cameras as well as crowd control steel fencing. There are also stand-by fire fighting equipment and metal detectors which have been put in place to avoid any misfortunes.\n\n==History of the Stadium==\nAlthough Nigeria had several stadiums scattered throughout the country, there was a lack of stadiums that met international standards. The capital city of Nigeria, Abuja, was selected to host the 8th All Africa Games in 2000 (a regional multi-sport event held every four years, organized by the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa) despite having no facilities for  such a major sporting event. The Federal Government of Nigeria embarked on a multimillion-dollar project for the construction of a state-of-the-art stadium and games village to be completed in time to host the All Africa Games. The contract was awarded on 18 July 2000 from a choice list of about 80 different bidders. Construction of the complex was initiated.\n\nCitizens and athletes had doubts as to whether the completion of the stadium was feasible before the games. However, construction went very smoothly and ended up being ahead of schedule. As a matter of fact, the stadium was scheduled to be the host center for the [[Miss World]] [[Beauty Contest|Beauty Pageant]] that took place later in 2002. Unfortunately, the stadium not being fully completed by then as well as an uprising amongst citizens especially in the northern city of [[Kaduna]] which resulted in loss of lives forced the pageant to relocate to [[London]], [[England]]. The construction of the main bowl went on from its inception in September 2000 to its completion in April 2003, well in time for the games. The Games Village construction went on from September 2000 to August 2003.\n\nThe official commissioning of the complex was on 8 April 2003. Following its commissioning was the final leg of preparations for the games. The games that year were the largest in All Africa Games history;<ref>\"8th All Africa Games.\" ''2K+ International Sports Media.'' Retrieved 30 October 2006</ref> 6,000 athletes from 53 countries competed in 22 sports, watched over by 1,200 officials. Over 1,500 journalists reported for the world's media. The games took place from the 4th to 18 October 2003 and was deemed successful by many. The host country, Nigeria, accumulated a total of 226 medals, emerging as leader of the games that year.\n\nApart from the All African Games, the stadium has hosted important football matches, such as World Cup qualifiers between Nigeria and other countries. The first game played at the stadium was a football (soccer) match between two local rival teams; the Shooting Stars of [[Ibadan]] and Sunshine Stars of [[Akure]] on 8 April 2003<ref>\"Nigeria; Who Will Score First International Goal at Abuja Stadium?.\" ''VANGUARD Newspapers'' 19 April 2003. Retrieved 30 October 2006</ref> The first goal scored in the complex was from Shooting Stars' striker Shakiru Lawal who scored the only goal of the game after just five minutes.\n\nThe complex has given the country confidence to bid for various up-coming international events. The Federation of International Volleyball (FIVB) has given the Nigeria Volleyball Federation (NVBF) the provisional hosting rights of the 2007 World Youth Championship because of the facilities the stadium has.\n\n==Other uses==\nApart from its function as a sports center, Moshood Abiola National Stadium serves as a home to cultural and religious events. Its capacity attracts various events such as concerts, and religious conferences, events which sometimes have preference over sports. Nigeria is a highly religious country with a population split almost equally between [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. Due to this fact, several religious events occur each year that attract a lot of citizens and require a large capacity arena. For example, in September 2006, the Nigeria Football Association was rendered helpless over the Presidency's preference of a religious event in the main bowl of the Moshood Abiola National Stadium to an international football match against Rwanda.\n\nSome citizens are however concerned about the use of the stadium for such large events. Similar events held at the Stadium in Lagos resulted in its demise. The management of the stadium, however, intends to keep these events coming. Cost of maintenance is an issue and renting out the facility for various events is a strategy that has been employed to cover these costs. There were no plans whatsoever by the former military ruler late general Sani Abacha to build a national stadium in Abuja as some people might think.\n\n==Maintenance==\nSeveral issues have risen concerning the maintenance of the sports complex. The [[National Stadium, Lagos|National Stadium]] in [[Lagos, Nigeria|Lagos]], the most populous and industrialized city in the country, was built for the [[1973 All-Africa Games]]. Though it initially was considered state-of-the-art, it today is considered below any standard facility-wise and environmental-wise. The Nigerian sports boss [[Amos Adamu]] advised the government to privatize the Abuja stadium immediately after the 2003 All-Africa Games in order to forestall the vandalisation typical of publicly owned buildings.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-22608356_ITM\n |title=COJA Boss Wants Abuja Stadium Sold.\n |date=4 March 2003\n |publisher=This Day (Nigeria)\n |accessdate=2009-09-18}}</ref>\n\nThe federal government of Nigeria, who owns 100% equity on the property at the moment, has faced a lot of antagonism both locally and internationally. The average estimate for annual maintenance since its inauguration has been about $7 million, a number considered high by many standards. Due to the high cost of maintenance, the federal government has been seeking options for privatization of the facility. Through the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), the Federal Government of Nigeria intends to grant a concession to a sole Concessionaire who will enter into an investment commitment, and essentially operate the stadium with a primary goal of generating revenue from the proceeds of sporting events, concerts, religious activities, corporate sponsorship, corporate advertising and other  promotional activities.\n\nThe Concessionaire has the choice of assuming the role of Facility Manager for the property encompassed in the National Stadium and the Indoor Sports Complex, or employ a firm to perform the task. The BPE will act as the monitor in the arrangement, and the Concessionaire will report to the federal government through the BPE. A minimum tenure of 20 years was recommended, subject to review every five years. Maintenance of the Stadium and its external areas will be the responsibility of the Concessionaire.\n\n==Change of Name==\nOn June 12 2019 President Muhammadu Buhari renamed the national stadium in Abuja after the winner of the 1993 presidential election, [[Moshood Abiola]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legit.ng/1243037-breaking-president-buhari-renames-abuja-sadium.html|title=President Buhari renames Abuja Stadium as MKO Abiola Stadium|last=Yusuf|first=Omotayo|date=2019-06-12|website=Legit.ng - Nigeria news.|language=en|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref>.

Although they remained happily married until Hess' death<ref>https://www.marxists.org/subject/jewish/moses-hess.pdf</ref>, Sibylle may have had an affair with Friedrich Engels while he was smuggling her from Belgium to France to be reunited with her husband.

As correspondent for the {{lang|de|Rheinische Zeitung}}, a radical newspaper founded by liberal Rhenish businessmen, he lived in Paris. He was a friend and collaborator of [[Karl Marx]] (who also worked on the {{lang|de|Rheinische Zeitung}}) and [[Friedrich Engels]].<ref name=\"Hunt_2010\">{{Citation |last=Hunt |first=Tristram |year=2010 |title=Marx's General: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mdj3AXU2YEEC |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=9781429983556 |postscript=.}}</ref> Hess introduced Engels, the future famous communist, to the [[communism]] of the early 1840s.<ref name=\"Hunt_2010\"/>\n\nBut Marx and Engels would become well known for their fickle and pugnacious approach to fellow socialists who showed insufficient agreement with their own form of socialism. By the late 1840s, they had fallen out with Hess.<ref name=\"Hunt_2010\"/> They mocked him, first behind his back and later openly. The work of Hess was also criticized in part of ''[[The German Ideology]]'' by Marx and Engels.<ref>''[[The German Ideology]]'',Tome II Part V</ref>\n\nHess fled to [[Belgium]] and [[Switzerland]] temporarily following the suppression of the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 commune]]. He would also go abroad during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u201371.\n\nHess died in Paris in 1875. As he requested, he  was buried in the Jewish cemetery of [[Cologne]]. In 1961 he was re-interred in the [[Kvutzat Kinneret|Kinneret]] Cemetery in Israel along with other [[Labor Zionism|Socialist-Zionists]] such as [[Nachman Syrkin]], [[Ber Borochov]], and [[Berl Katznelson]]. \n\n[[Moshav]] [[Kfar Hess]] was named in his honour.\n[[Image:Moses Hess.jpg|thumb|right|Moses Hess]]\n\n==Views and opinions==\nHess became reluctant to base all history on economic causes and [[class struggle]] (as Marx and Engels did), and he came to see the struggle of races, or nationalities, as the prime factor of history.\n\nAccording to George Litcheim, Hess, who differed from Marx on a number of issues, still testified in a letter to [[Alexander Herzen]] that what he and Herzen were writing about \"resembles a neat sketch drawn on paper, whereas Marx's judgment upon these events [European upheavals] is as it were engraved with iron force in the rock of time\" (Paraphrased by George Lichtheim, ''A Short History of Socialism'', 1971 p.&nbsp;80).\n\nFrom 1861 to 1863 he lived in Germany, where he became acquainted with the rising tide of German [[antisemitism]]. It was then that he reverted to his Jewish name Moses (after apparently going by Moritz Hess)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Moses-Hess|title=Moses Hess &#124; German author and Zionist|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> in protest against [[Jewish assimilation]]. He published ''[[s:Rome and Jerusalem|Rome and Jerusalem]]'' in 1862. Hess interprets history as a circle of [[Ethnic nationalism|race]] and national struggles. He contemplated the rise of [[Italian nationalism]] and the German reaction to it, and from this he arrived at the idea of Jewish national revival, and at his prescient understanding that the Germans would not be tolerant of the national aspirations of others and would be particularly intolerant of the Jews. His book calls for the establishment of a Jewish socialist commonwealth in Palestine, in line with the emerging national movements in Europe and as the only way to respond to antisemitism and assert Jewish identity in the modern world.\n\n[[File:Hess grave.JPG|thumb|Hess's grave near [[Lake Kinneret]], Israel]]\n\n==Scholarly work==\nHess's ''Rome and Jerusalem: The Last National Question'' went unnoticed in his time, as most German Jews preferred [[cultural assimilation]].

Hess received a Jewish religious education from his grandfather, and later studied philosophy at the [[University of Bonn]], but never graduated.\n\nHe married a poor Catholic seamstress, Sibylle Pesch, \"in order to redress the injustice perpetrated by society\". Although they remained happily married until Hess' death<ref>https://www.marxists.org/subject/jewish/moses-hess.pdf</ref>, Sibylle may have had an affair with Friedrich Engels while he was smuggling her from Belgium to France to be reunited with her husband. The incident may have precipitated Hess' split from the Communist movement<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4eYXc1B1vPoC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=Friedrich+Engels+Sybille+Pesch#v=onepage|title=The Life of Friedrich Engels|last=Henderson|first=William Otto|date=1976|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9780714640020|language=en}}</ref>. \n\nHess was an early proponent of [[socialism]], and a precursor to what would later be called [[Zionism]]. As correspondent for the {{lang|de|Rheinische Zeitung}}, a radical newspaper founded by liberal Rhenish businessmen, he lived in Paris.

By the late 1840s, they had fallen out with Hess.<ref name=\"Hunt_2010\"/> They mocked him, first behind his back and later openly. The work of Hess was also criticized in part of ''[[The German Ideology]]'' by Marx and Engels.<ref>''[[The German Ideology]]'',Tome II Part V</ref>\n\nHess fled to [[Belgium]] and [[Switzerland]] temporarily following the suppression of the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 commune]]. He would also go abroad during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u201371.\n\nHess died in Paris in 1875. As he requested, he  was buried in the Jewish cemetery of [[Cologne]]. In 1961 he was re-interred in the [[Kvutzat Kinneret|Kinneret]] Cemetery in Israel along with other [[Labor Zionism|Socialist-Zionists]] such as [[Nachman Syrkin]], [[Ber Borochov]], and [[Berl Katznelson]]. \n\n[[Moshav]] [[Kfar Hess]] was named in his honour.\n[[Image:Moses Hess.jpg|thumb|right|Moses Hess]]\n\n==Views and opinions==\nHess became reluctant to base all history on economic causes and [[class struggle]] (as Marx and Engels did), and he came to see the struggle of races, or nationalities, as the prime factor of history.\n\nAccording to George Litcheim, Hess, who differed from Marx on a number of issues, still testified in a letter to [[Alexander Herzen]] that what he and Herzen were writing about \"resembles a neat sketch drawn on paper, whereas Marx's judgment upon these events [European upheavals] is as it were engraved with iron force in the rock of time\" (Paraphrased by George Lichtheim, ''A Short History of Socialism'', 1971 p.&nbsp;80).\n\nFrom 1861 to 1863 he lived in Germany, where he became acquainted with the rising tide of German [[antisemitism]]. It was then that he reverted to his Jewish name Moses (after apparently going by Moritz Hess)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Moses-Hess|title=Moses Hess &#124; German author and Zionist|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> in protest against [[Jewish assimilation]]. He published ''[[s:Rome and Jerusalem|Rome and Jerusalem]]'' in 1862. Hess interprets history as a circle of [[Ethnic nationalism|race]] and national struggles. He contemplated the rise of [[Italian nationalism]] and the German reaction to it, and from this he arrived at the idea of Jewish national revival, and at his prescient understanding that the Germans would not be tolerant of the national aspirations of others and would be particularly intolerant of the Jews. His book calls for the establishment of a Jewish socialist commonwealth in Palestine, in line with the emerging national movements in Europe and as the only way to respond to antisemitism and assert Jewish identity in the modern world.\n\n[[File:Hess grave.JPG|thumb|Hess's grave near [[Lake Kinneret]], Israel]]\n\n==Scholarly work==\nHess's ''Rome and Jerusalem: The Last National Question'' went unnoticed in his time, as most German Jews preferred [[cultural assimilation]].

It was ruled throughout its history by the [[Nanbu clan]].<ref>Taniguchi, Makoto and Takayuki Shiraiwa. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=XowKAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA44&dq=  ''The orphan tsunami of 1700'', pp. 44\u201345].</ref>  It was called {{nihongo|'''Nanbu Domain'''|\u5357\u90e8\u85e9|Nanbu han}} during the early part of its history. It was located in northern [[Mutsu Province]], [[Honsh\u016b]], covering the eastern half of what is now [[Aomori Prefecture]] and the northern two-thirds of what is now [[Iwate Prefecture]] and the [[Kazuno District, Akita|Kazuno District]] of what is now [[Akita Prefecture]]. The domain was centered at [[Morioka Castle]] in the city of [[Morioka]]. For most of its history, Morioka Domain had an official ''[[kokudaka]]'' of 100,000 ''[[koku]]'', although its actual revenues were much higher. Towards the end of the Edo period, the domain\u2019s status was raised to 200,000 ''koku''.\n\n==History==\nThe Nanbu clan was a branch of the [[Seiwa Genji]] originally from [[Kai Province]], who settled in what is now the town of [[Nanbu, Aomori]] after the conquest of the [[Northern Fujiwara|Hiraizumi Fujiwara]] by [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]]. Along with the [[Shimazu clan]] of [[Satsuma Province]], the Nanbu clan has the distinction of being one of the two clans which held onto their territories for over 700 years, from the [[Kamakura period]] to the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nIn July 1590, the 26th chieftain of the Nanbu clan, [[Nanbu Nobunao]], made an [[oath of fealty]] to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] at the [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|Siege of Odawara]], and was officially confirmed as  ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of seven districts of northern Mutsu province (Nukanobu, Hei, Kazuno, Kuji, Iwate, Shiwa and T\u014dno). Hideyoshi assisted in the suppression of the [[Kunohe Rebellion]] of 1591 which secured Nobunao's position as head of all the branches of the Nanbu clan. However, Hideyoshi also recognised the independence of the [[Tsugaru clan]], former Nanbu retainers, and their control over the three districts of [[Tsugaru Peninsula]], but gave the Nanbu clan the additional districts of Hienuki and Waga as compensation. Nanbu Nobunao relocated his seat from [[Sannohe Castle]] to the more central location of Morioka, and began work on Morioka Castle and its surrounding [[castle town]] in 1592.\n\nIn 1600, following the [[Battle of Sekigahara]], Nanbu Nobunao's son [[Nanbu Toshinao]] was confirmed by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] as ''daimy\u014d'' with an assessed ''kokudaka'' of 100,000 ''koku''. This marks the official start of Morioka Domain under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].<ref>''Nihonshi y\u014dgosh\u016b'' (Tokyo: Yamakawa shuppansha, 2000), p. 104.</ref> \n\nIn 1627, in order to strengthen its southern border against the [[Date clan]] of [[Sendai Domain]], a branch of the Nanbu clan from [[Ne Castle]] near [[Hachinohe, Aomori|Hachinohe]] was relocated to [[T\u014dno, Iwate|T\u014dno]], forming a subsidiary line.\n\nIn 1634, [[Nukanobu District]] was divided into the four districts of Sannohe, Ninohe, Kunohe and Kita by order of the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]], giving the Nanbu clan control over a total of 10 districts of Mutsu province.\n\nIn 1664, the 20,000 ''koku'' [[Hachinohe Domain]] was split from Morioka Domain as a nominally subsidiary domain.<ref name=\"hachinohe\">{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~me4K-skri/han/mutudewa/hachinohe.html \"Hachinohe-han\" on Edo 300 HTML] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222743/http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~me4K-skri/han/mutudewa/hachinohe.html |date=2016-03-03 }} (accessed 15 August 2008)</ref> However, relations between Morioka and Hachinohe were often strained and Hachinohe was considered independent, rather than a subsidiary. Morioka Domain was thus reduced to 80,000 ''koku'', but was able to develop new rice lands, and reverted to 100,000 ''koku'' status in 1683. The 5th ''daimy\u014d'', [[Nanbu Yukinobu]], reduced the domain to 92,000 ''koku'' by setting up his two younger brothers as ''[[hatamoto]]'' with 5000 ''koku'' and 3000 ''koku'' each.\n\nIn 1808, the Tokugawa shogunate assigned the Nanbu clan responsibility for the defence of a portion of southern [[Ezo]].<ref>Noguchi Shin'ichi (2005). ''Aizu-han''. (Tokyo: Gendai shokan), p. 194.</ref> The nominal ''kokudaka'' for Morioka clan was raised to 200,000 ''koku''<ref name=\"morioka\">{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~me4K-skri/han/mutudewa/morioka.html \"Morioka-han\" on Edo 300 HTML] (accessed 15 August 2008)</ref> and their status from \"castle-holding ''daimy\u014d''\" to \"province-holding ''daimy\u014d''\". However, this increase in status came without any actual increase in territory, and the additional actual revenues from trading  posts established in Ezo was small. The result was to plunge the domain\u2019s finances, already suffering from repeated crop failures due to inclement weather and reduction in output from its copper mines, into the red.\n\nIn 1819, the subsidiary [[Shichinohe Domain]] was created out of 6000 ''koku'' of new rice land combined with a 5000-''koku'' ''hatamoto'' holding.<ref name=\"shichinohe\">{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~me4K-skri/han/mutudewa/shichinohe.html \"Shichinohe-han\" on Edo 300 HTML] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304211147/http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~me4k-skri/han/mutudewa/shichinohe.html |date=2016-03-04 }} (accessed 15 August 2008)</ref>\n\nIn 1821, the [[S\u014dma Daisaku incident]], in which a retainer of the Nanbu clan attempted to assassinate the ''daimy\u014d'' of Tsugaru Domain occurred. The Nanbu clan and the Tsugaru clan had been enemies for centuries. This was the same year during which the domain faced its most serious crisis. The 11th ''daimy\u014d'', [[Nanbu Toshimochi]], died at the age of 13 before he could be formally received in audience by ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ienari]]. Fearing that this could be used by the shogunate as a cause for [[attainder]] , the domain leaders substituted a cousin of similar age and appearance to take his place.\n\nIn 1840, a [[han school]] was established, and began promoting studies in ''[[rangaku]]'' (western science), especially western medicine.\n\nDuring the [[Bakumatsu period]], in 1857 the 14th ''daimy\u014d'' of Morioka, [[Nanbu Toshihisa]], married the third daughter of [[Tokugawa Nariaki]] of [[Mito Domain]]. With the start of the [[Boshin War]], the domain initially attempted to remain neutral, but bowed to pressure from [[Sendai Domain]] and joined the [[\u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei]].<ref>Hoshi, ''\u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei'', pp. 88\u201389.</ref> Morioka forces attacked the pro-Imperial Tsugaru Domain and [[Akita Domain]]<ref name=\"onodera 140\">Onodera, ''Boshin nanboku sens\u014d to T\u014dhoku seiken'', p. 149.</ref> . As a result, the new [[Meiji government]] treated Nanbu clan harshly at the end of the war by seizing the territory and expelling the Nanbu clan to the vacant [[Shiroishi Castle]], where a new 130,000 ''koku'' domain was created out of former Sendai Domain lands in early 1868<ref>''Nanbu ch\u016bi'' \u5357\u90e8\u4e2d\u5c09, p. 4. (Accessed from [http://kindai.ndl.go.jp/index.html National Diet Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211193757/http://kindai.ndl.go.jp/index.html |date=2010-02-11 }}, 15 August 2008)</ref> .\n\nSix months later, the Nanbu petitioned to return to Morioka, to which the government agreed provided that they paid a penalty of 700,000 gold ''[[ry\u014d]]''. Although this sum proved impossible amount to raise, the Nanbu were allowed to return shortly before the [[abolition of the han system]]. The lands of former Morioka Domain became Morioka Prefecture, which subsequently became part of Iwate Prefecture in January 1872.\n\n==List of ''daimy\u014ds''==\n* [[File:Japanese Crest Nannbu Turu.svg|25px]] '''[[Nanbu clan]]''' (''[[Tozama daimy\u014d|tozama]]'') 1599\u20131871\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!  ||Name || Tenure || Courtesy title || [[List of Japanese court ranks, positions and hereditary titles|Court Rank]]|| ''[[Kokudaka]]''\n|-\n||1||{{nihongo|[[Nanbu Toshinao]]|\u5357\u90e8\u4fe1\u76f4}}||1599\u20131632||''Shinano-no-kami'' (\u4fe1\u6fc3\u5b88)|| Senior 4th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f93\u56db\u4f4d\u4e0b) ||100,000 ''koku''\n|-\n||2||{{nihongo|[[Nanbu Shigenao]]| \u5357\u90e8\u91cd\u76f4}}||1632\u20131664|| ''Yamashiro-no-kami'' (\u5c71\u57ce\u5b88)|| Senior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b) ||100,000 ''koku''\n|-\n||3||{{nihongo|[[Nanbu Shigenobu]]|\u5357\u90e8\u91cd\u4fe1}}||1664\u20131692||''Daizen-no-taifu'' (\u5927\u81b3\u5927\u592b) || Senior 4th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f93\u56db\u4f4d\u4e0b) ||80,000 ->100,000 ''koku''\n|-\n||4||{{nihongo|[[Nanbu Yukinobu]]|\u5357\u90e8\u884c\u4fe1}}||1692\u20131702||''Shinano-no-kami'' (\u4fe1\u6fc3\u5b88) || Senior 4th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f93\u56db\u4f4d\u4e0b) ||100,000 ''koku''\n|-\n||5||{{nihongo|[[Nanbu Nobuoki]]|\u5357\u90e8\u4fe1\u6069}}||1702\u20131705||''Bingo-no-kami'' (\u5099\u5f8c\u5b88) || Senior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)  ||100,000 ''koku''\n|-\n||6||{{nihongo|[[Nanbu Toshitomo]]|\u5357\u90e8\u5229\u5e79}}||1705\u20131725||''Shinano-no-kami'' (\u4fe1\u6fc3\u5b88)|| Senior 4th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f93\u56db\u4f4d\u4e0b) ||100,000 ''koku''\n|-\n||7||{{nihongo|[[Nanbu Toshimi]]|\u5357\u90e8\u5229\u8996}}||1725\u20131752||''Daizen-no-daifu'' (\u5927\u81b3\u5927\u592b) || Senior 4th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f93\u56db\u4f4d\u4e0b) ||100,000 ''koku''\n|-\n||8||{{nihongo|[[Nanbu Toshikatsu]]|\u5357\u90e8\u5229\u96c4}}||1752\u20131779||''Daizen-no-taifu'' (\u5927\u81b3\u5927\u592b) || Senior 4th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f93\u56db\u4f4d\u4e0b) ||100,000 ''koku''\n|-\n||9||{{nihongo|[[Nanbu Toshimasa]]|\u5357\u90e8\u5229\u6b63}}||1780\u20131784||''Daizen-no-taifu'' (\u5927\u81b3\u5927\u592b) || Senior 4th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f93\u56db\u4f4d\u4e0b) ||100,000 ''koku''\n|-\n||10||{{nihongo|[[Nanbu Toshitaka]]|\u5357\u90e8\u5229\u656c}}||1784\u20131820||''Daizen-no-taifu'' (\u5927\u81b3\u5927\u592b)|| Senior 4th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f93\u56db\u4f4d\u4e0b) ||100,000 ->200,000 ''koku''\n|-\n||11||{{nihongo|[[Nanbu Toshimochi]]| \u5357\u90e8\u5229\u7528}}||1820\u20131825|| ''Daizen-no-taifu'' (\u5927\u81b3\u5927\u592b)|| Senior 4th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f93\u56db\u4f4d\u4e0b) ||200,000 ''koku''\n|-\n||12||{{nihongo|[[Nanbu Toshitada]]|\u5357\u90e8\u5229\u6e08}}||1825\u20131847||''Shinano-no-kami'' (\u4fe1\u6fc3\u5b88) || Senior 4th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f93\u56db\u4f4d\u4e0b)||200,000 ''koku''\n|-\n||13||{{nihongo|[[Nanbu Toshitomo]]|\u5357\u90e8\u5229\u7fa9}}||1847\u20131848||''Kai-no-kami'' (\u7532\u6590\u5b88) || Senior 4th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f93\u56db\u4f4d\u4e0b)||200,000 ''koku''\n|-\n||14||{{nihongo|[[Nanbu Toshihisa]]| \u5357\u90e8\u5229\u525b}}||1848\u20131868||''Min\u014d-no-kami'' (\u7f8e\u6fc3\u5b88), ''Jij\u016b'' (\u4f8d\u5f93) || Senior 4th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f93\u56db\u4f4d\u4e0b)||200,000 ''koku''\n|-\n||15||{{nihongo|[[Nanbu Toshiyuki]]|\u5357\u90e8\u5229\u606d}}||1868\u20131871||''Kai-no-kami'' (\u7532\u6590\u5b88) || Senior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)  ||200,000 ''koku''\n|-\n|}\n\n===Genealogy===\n{{Tree list}}\n*[[file:Simple silver crown.svg|15px]] '''I.

It was ruled throughout its history by the [[Nanbu clan]].<ref>Taniguchi, Makoto and Takayuki Shiraiwa. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=XowKAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA44&dq=  ''The orphan tsunami of 1700'', pp. 44\u201345].</ref>  It was called {{nihongo|'''Nanbu Domain'''|\u5357\u90e8\u85e9|Nanbu han}} during the early part of its history. It was located in northern [[Mutsu Province]], [[Honsh\u016b]], covering the eastern half of what is now [[Aomori Prefecture]] and the northern two-thirds of what is now [[Iwate Prefecture]] and the [[Kazuno District, Akita|Kazuno District]] of what is now [[Akita Prefecture]]. The domain was centered at [[Morioka Castle]] in the city of [[Morioka]]. For most of its history, Morioka Domain had an official ''[[kokudaka]]'' of 100,000 ''[[koku]]'', although its actual revenues were much higher. Towards the end of the Edo period, the domain\u2019s status was raised to 200,000 ''koku''.\n\n==History==\nThe Nanbu clan was a branch of the [[Seiwa Genji]] originally from [[Kai Province]], who settled in what is now the town of [[Nanbu, Aomori]] after the conquest of the [[Northern Fujiwara|Hiraizumi Fujiwara]] by [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]]. Along with the [[Shimazu clan]] of [[Satsuma Province]], the Nanbu clan has the distinction of being one of the two clans which held onto their territories for over 700 years, from the [[Kamakura period]] to the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nIn July 1590, the 26th chieftain of the Nanbu clan, [[Nanbu Nobunao]], made an [[oath of fealty]] to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] at the [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|Siege of Odawara]], and was officially confirmed as  ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of seven districts of northern Mutsu province (Nukanobu, Hei, Kazuno, Kuji, Iwate, Shiwa and T\u014dno). Hideyoshi assisted in the suppression of the [[Kunohe Rebellion]] of 1591 which secured Nobunao's position as head of all the branches of the Nanbu clan. However, Hideyoshi also recognised the independence of the [[Tsugaru clan]], former Nanbu retainers, and their control over the three districts of [[Tsugaru Peninsula]], but gave the Nanbu clan the additional districts of Hienuki and Waga as compensation. Nanbu Nobunao relocated his seat from [[Sannohe Castle]] to the more central location of Morioka, and began work on Morioka Castle and its surrounding [[castle town]] in 1592.\n\nIn 1600, following the [[Battle of Sekigahara]], Nanbu Nobunao's son [[Nanbu Toshinao]] was confirmed by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] as ''daimy\u014d'' with an assessed ''kokudaka'' of 100,000 ''koku''. This marks the official start of Morioka Domain under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].<ref>''Nihonshi y\u014dgosh\u016b'' (Tokyo: Yamakawa shuppansha, 2000), p. 104.</ref> \n\nIn 1627, in order to strengthen its southern border against the [[Date clan]] of [[Sendai Domain]], a branch of the Nanbu clan from [[Ne Castle]] near [[Hachinohe, Aomori|Hachinohe]] was relocated to [[T\u014dno, Iwate|T\u014dno]], forming a subsidiary line.\n\nIn 1634, [[Nukanobu District]] was divided into the four districts of Sannohe, Ninohe, Kunohe and Kita by order of the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]], giving the Nanbu clan control over a total of 10 districts of Mutsu province.\n\nIn 1664, the 20,000 ''koku'' [[Hachinohe Domain]] was split from Morioka Domain as a nominally subsidiary domain<ref name=\"hachinohe\">{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~me4K-skri/han/mutudewa/hachinohe.html \"Hachinohe-han\" on Edo 300 HTML] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222743/http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~me4K-skri/han/mutudewa/hachinohe.html |date=2016-03-03 }} (accessed 15 August 2008)</ref>. However, relations between Morioka and Hachinohe were often strained and Hachinohe was considered independent, rather than a subsidiary. Morioka Domain was thus reduced to 80,000 ''koku'', but was able to develop new rice lands, and reverted to 100,000 ''koku'' status in 1683. The 5th ''daimy\u014d'', [[Nanbu Yukinobu]], reduced the domain to 92,000 ''koku'' by setting up his two younger brothers as ''[[hatamoto]]'' with 5000 ''koku'' and 3000 ''koku'' each.\n\nIn 1808, the Tokugawa shogunate assigned the Nanbu clan responsibility for the defence of a portion of southern [[Ezo]]<ref>Noguchi Shin'ichi (2005). ''Aizu-han''. (Tokyo: Gendai shokan), p. 194.</ref>. The nominal ''kokudaka'' for Morioka clan was raised to 200,000 ''koku''<ref name=\"morioka\">{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~me4K-skri/han/mutudewa/morioka.html \"Morioka-han\" on Edo 300 HTML] (accessed 15 August 2008)</ref> and their status from \"castle-holding ''daimy\u014d''\" to \"province-holding ''daimy\u014d''\". However, this increase in status came without any actual increase in territory, and the additional actual revenues from trading  posts established in Ezo was small. The result was to plunge the domain\u2019s finances, already suffering from repeated crop failures due to inclement weather and reduction in output from its copper mines, into the red.\n\nIn 1819, the subsidiary [[Shichinohe Domain]] was created out of 6000 ''koku'' of new rice land combined with a 5000-''koku'' ''hatamoto'' holding.<ref name=\"shichinohe\">{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~me4K-skri/han/mutudewa/shichinohe.html \"Shichinohe-han\" on Edo 300 HTML] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304211147/http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~me4k-skri/han/mutudewa/shichinohe.html |date=2016-03-04 }} (accessed 15 August 2008)</ref>\n\nIn 1821, the [[S\u014dma Daisaku incident]], in which a retainer of the Nanbu clan attempted to assassinate the ''daimy\u014d'' of Tsugaru Domain occurred. The Nanbu clan and the Tsugaru clan had been enemies for centuries. This was the same year during which the domain faced its most serious crisis. The 11th ''daimy\u014d'', [[Nanbu Toshimochi]], died at the age of 13 before he could be formally received in audience by ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ienari]]. Fearing that this could be used by the shogunate as a cause for [[attainder]] , the domain leaders substituted a cousin of similar age and appearance to take his place.\n\nIn 1840, a [[han school]] was established, and began promoting studies in ''[[rangaku]]'' (western science), especially western medicine.\n\nDuring the [[Bakumatsu period]], in 1857 the 14th ''daimy\u014d'' of Morioka, [[Nanbu Toshihisa]], married the third daughter of [[Tokugawa Nariaki]] of [[Mito Domain]]. With the start of the [[Boshin War]], the domain initially attempted to remain neutral, but bowed to pressure from [[Sendai Domain]] and joined the [[\u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei]]<ref>Hoshi, ''\u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei'', pp. 88\u201389.</ref>.

As a result, the new [[Meiji government]] treated Nanbu clan harshly at the end of the war by seizing the territory and expelling the Nanbu clan to the vacant [[Shiroishi Castle]], where a new 130,000 ''koku'' domain was created out of former Sendai Domain lands in early 1868<ref>''Nanbu ch\u016bi'' \u5357\u90e8\u4e2d\u5c09, p. 4.

Although this sum proved impossible amount to raise, the Nanbu were allowed to return shortly before the [[abolition of the han system]].

The plays were usually written for television, although adaptations from other sources also featured. The series gained a reputation for presenting contemporary social dramas, and for bringing issues to the attention of a mass audience that would not otherwise have been discussed on screen.\n\nSome of British television drama's most influential, and controversial, plays were shown in this slot, including ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]''. The earliest television plays of [[Dennis Potter]] were featured in this slot.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early seasons===\nThe series was suggested to the BBC's Head of Drama, [[Sydney Newman]], by the corporation's director of television [[Kenneth Adam]] after his cancellation of the two previous series of single plays.<ref name=\"Wake\">Oliver Wake [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454700/ \"Wednesday Play, The (1964-70)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> Newman had been persuaded to join the BBC following the success of the similar programme ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', which he had produced while Head of Drama at [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] from 1958 to 1962. ''Armchair Theatre'' had tackled many difficult and socially relevant subjects in the then-popular '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' style, and still managed to gain a mass audience on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, and Newman wanted a programme that would be able to tackle similar issues with a broad appeal. Newman also wanted to get away from the BBC's reputation of producing safe and unchallenging drama programmes, to produce something with more bite and vigour, what Newman called \"agitational contemporaneity\".<ref name=\"Wake\"/>\n\n''The Wednesday Play'' succeeded in meeting this aim, and the BBC quickly developed the practice of stockpiling six or seven ''Wednesday Plays'' in case there were problems with individual works.<ref>Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh [https://books.google.com/books?id=RxBJC2U5oRoC&pg=PA149 \"The BBC and the Birth of the Wednesday Play 1962-66\"] in Janet Thumim ''Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s'', London: I.B. Tauris, 2000, p.149-64, 159</ref> One production, ''[[The War Game]]'' (1965), was withdrawn from broadcast by a nervous BBC under pressure from the government, while [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]' ''[[Fable (TV play)|Fable]]'' (20 January 1965),<ref name=\"Duguid\">Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/476259/ \"Fable (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> an inversion of South Africa's [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]] system, was delayed for several weeks over fears that it would incite racial tensions.<ref name=\"Duguid\"/>\n\nIntended as a vehicle for new writers, several careers began thanks to the series. Television programmes had a much shorter [[lead time]] in this era, and [[Dennis Potter]]'s first four accepted television plays were shown during the course of 1965. The two [[The Nigel Barton Plays|Nigel Barton plays]] (8<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/810533/index.html \"Stand Up, Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and 15 December 1965)<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1041034/ \"Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> first brought him to widespread public attention and the slightly earlier ''Alice'' (13 October 1965),<ref>John R. Cook ''Dennis Potter: a life on screen'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, p.333, n.3:5</ref> about [[Lewis Carroll]]'s relationship with [[Alice Liddell]], developed themes to which Potter would return.\n\nIn the first half of 1966 a series of 26 ''Wednesday Plays'' were produced by [[Peter Luke]], the playwright, and story edited by [[David Benedictus]]. Highlights included ''The Snowball'' (20 April 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\">Irene Shubik ''Play for Today: the evolution of television drama'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000 [1975], p.46</ref> adapted from the novel by [[Brigid Brophy]], ''Toddler on the Run'' adapted by [[Shena Mackay]] from her novella and directed by [[James MacTaggart]], (25 May 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> ''Cock Hen and Courting Pit'' (renamed ''A Tour of the Old Floorboards'', 22 June 1966)<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> by [[David Halliwell]] and two plays by [[Frank O'Connor]] (which [[Hugh Leonard]] adapted)<ref name=\"MMK&SL\">Madeleine MacMurragh-Kavanagh and Stephen Lacey \"Who Framed Theatre?: The 'Moment of Change' in British TV Drama\" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'', No.57, February 1999, p.69</ref> virtually without dialogue<ref name=\"MMK&SL\"/> and which, renamed ''Silent Song'', won The [[Prix Italia]] award<ref>Adam Benedick and Sydney Newman [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peter-luke--obituaries-1569776.html Obituary: Peter Luke,] ''The Independent'', 26 January 1995</ref> in 1967 for 'original dramatic programmes' jointly with a French programme.<ref>[http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf \"Winners 1949-2010\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022124024/http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, Prix Italia official website</ref> The other O'Connor/Leonard work was ''The Retreat'' (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> These two plays starred [[Milo O'Shea]] and [[Jack McGowran]]. ''Cathy Come Home'' by [[Nell Dunn]] and [[Jeremy Sandford]] was offered to the Luke/Benedictus team who passed it on to [[Tony Garnett]].\n\n===Tony Garnett and Ken Loach===\nGarnett was quickly seen as someone capable of delivering plays which would gain much publicity for the BBC and its Drama department.<ref name=\"Lacey1\">Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.56</ref> He had the enthusiastic support of Newman, his immediate superior, who lobbied for increased funding to allow for more location shooting on film rather than shooting productions in the multi-camera electronic television studio, a practice which was felt to impair realism, the preferred mode.<ref name=\"Lacey1\"/>\n\nDirector [[Ken Loach]] made ten plays in all for ''The Wednesday Play'' series.<ref>Jacob Leigh ''The Cinema of Ken Loach: Art in the Service of the People'', London: Wallflower Press, 2002, p.195</ref> Two of them are among the best remembered of the entire run: an adaptation of [[Nell Dunn]]'s ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' (3 November 1965),<ref>Ros Cranston [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/440997/ \"Up the Junction (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and the saga of a homeless young couple and their battle to prevent their children being taken into local authority care: ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (16 November 1966).<ref>Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438481/ \"Cathy Come Home (1966)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> The latter began Loach's 13 year collaboration with Tony Garnett as his producer, although Garnett had been closely involved with ''Up the Junction'' as well.<ref>Jason Deans and Maggie Brown [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/28/tony-garnett-mother-backstreet-abortion-death \"Up the Junction's Tony Garnett reveals mother's backstreet abortion death\"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2013</ref>\n\nPlays like ''Up the Junction'' though were controversial among more conservative viewers. The 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] accused the BBC of portraying \"promiscuity as normal\" in ''Up the Junction''<ref name=\"Hayward\">Anthony Hayward [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/cathy-come-home-422630.html \"Cathy come home\",] ''The Independent'', 3 November 2006</ref> and ''The Wednesday Play'' as featuring \"Dirt, Doubt and Disbelief\".<ref>Asa Briggs ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume 5'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.519</ref> The writer on  television [[Anthony Hayward]] quoted Garnett in 2006: \"Mary Whitehouse was on the prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings.\"<ref name=\"Hayward\"/> The 'drama documentary' approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' article published before its first repeat transmission [[Grace Wyndham Goldie]] complained that ''Cathy Come Home'' \"deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ...

Highlights from this period include several plays by [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]] such as ''[[In Two Minds]]'' (1 March 1967)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557285/ \"''In Two Minds'' (1967)\"], BFI Screenonline</ref> and ''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (10 April 1968)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/539459/ \"''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (1968)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and Potter's ''[[Son of Man (play)|Son of Man]]'' (16 April 1969),<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1056162/ \"''Son of Man'' (1969)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> a modern interpretation of the story of [[Jesus]].\n\nSuffering from declining audience figures, the run of ''The Wednesday Play'' ended in 1970 when the day of transmission changed, and the series morphed into ''[[Play for Today]]''.\n\n==Reputation and availability==\nIt is regarded as one of the most influential and successful programmes to be produced in Britain during the 1960s, and is still frequently referenced and discussed. In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] to find the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, two ''Wednesday Plays'' made the list: ''The War Game'' was placed twenty-seventh, and ''Cathy Come Home'' was voted the second greatest British television programme of the century.\n\nSome examples of ''The Wednesday Play'', such as ''[[The War Game]]'' (which was not screened by the BBC for 20 years) and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (1966), a television play exploring the theme of housing and homelessness, was according to filmmaker [[Roger Graef]] \"a giant wakeup call for the whole nation,\"<ref>Roger Graef [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/15/homelessness.communities \"Out of the box\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2006</ref> and some of the Potter plays, surfaced on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]; the Potter play, ''Alice'' was a bonus feature of a Region 1 DVD in 2010 of [[Jonathan Miller]]'s surrealist version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. The Ken Loach material has resurfaced in a ''Ken Loach at the BBC'' set. However, as with much British television of this era, many episodes are [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|lost]], leaving 76 surviving in the Archives<!-- Not necessarily the BBCs. --> (along with 3 with some surviving sequences) out of 170 transmitted.<ref>[http://lostshows.com/default.aspx?programme=af856159-e83f-4614-89e2-7e69b050cf42 ''Missing or incomplete episodes for programme ''The Wednesday Play''\"], lostshows.com</ref>\n\n==Productions==\nThis table is based on records in the BBC Genome archive of the Radio Times<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/</ref>.

The plays were usually written for television, although adaptations from other sources also featured. The series gained a reputation for presenting contemporary social dramas, and for bringing issues to the attention of a mass audience that would not otherwise have been discussed on screen.\n\nSome of British television drama's most influential, and controversial, plays were shown in this slot, including ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]''. The earliest television plays of [[Dennis Potter]] were featured in this slot.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early seasons===\nThe series was suggested to the BBC's Head of Drama, [[Sydney Newman]], by the corporation's director of television [[Kenneth Adam]] after his cancellation of the two previous series of single plays.<ref name=\"Wake\">Oliver Wake [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454700/ \"Wednesday Play, The (1964-70)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> Newman had been persuaded to join the BBC following the success of the similar programme ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', which he had produced while Head of Drama at [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] from 1958 to 1962. ''Armchair Theatre'' had tackled many difficult and socially relevant subjects in the then-popular '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' style, and still managed to gain a mass audience on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, and Newman wanted a programme that would be able to tackle similar issues with a broad appeal. Newman also wanted to get away from the BBC's reputation of producing safe and unchallenging drama programmes, to produce something with more bite and vigour, what Newman called \"agitational contemporaneity\".<ref name=\"Wake\"/>\n\n''The Wednesday Play'' succeeded in meeting this aim, and the BBC quickly developed the practice of stockpiling six or seven ''Wednesday Plays'' in case there were problems with individual works.<ref>Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh [https://books.google.com/books?id=RxBJC2U5oRoC&pg=PA149 \"The BBC and the Birth of the Wednesday Play 1962-66\"] in Janet Thumim ''Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s'', London: I.B. Tauris, 2000, p.149-64, 159</ref> One production, ''[[The War Game]]'' (1965), was withdrawn from broadcast by a nervous BBC under pressure from the government, while [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]' ''[[Fable (TV play)|Fable]]'' (20 January 1965),<ref name=\"Duguid\">Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/476259/ \"Fable (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> an inversion of South Africa's [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]] system, was delayed for several weeks over fears that it would incite racial tensions.<ref name=\"Duguid\"/>\n\nIntended as a vehicle for new writers, several careers began thanks to the series. Television programmes had a much shorter [[lead time]] in this era, and [[Dennis Potter]]'s first four accepted television plays were shown during the course of 1965. The two [[The Nigel Barton Plays|Nigel Barton plays]] (8<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/810533/index.html \"Stand Up, Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and 15 December 1965)<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1041034/ \"Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> first brought him to widespread public attention and the slightly earlier ''Alice'' (13 October 1965),<ref>John R. Cook ''Dennis Potter: a life on screen'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, p.333, n.3:5</ref> about [[Lewis Carroll]]'s relationship with [[Alice Liddell]], developed themes to which Potter would return.\n\nIn the first half of 1966 a series of 26 ''Wednesday Plays'' were produced by [[Peter Luke]], the playwright, and story edited by [[David Benedictus]]. Highlights included ''The Snowball'' (20 April 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\">Irene Shubik ''Play for Today: the evolution of television drama'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000 [1975], p.46</ref> adapted from the novel by [[Brigid Brophy]], ''Toddler on the Run'' adapted by [[Shena Mackay]] from her novella and directed by [[James MacTaggart]], (25 May 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> ''Cock Hen and Courting Pit'' (renamed ''A Tour of the Old Floorboards'', 22 June 1966)<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> by [[David Halliwell]] and two plays by [[Frank O'Connor]] (which [[Hugh Leonard]] adapted)<ref name=\"MMK&SL\">Madeleine MacMurragh-Kavanagh and Stephen Lacey \"Who Framed Theatre?: The 'Moment of Change' in British TV Drama\" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'', No.57, February 1999, p.69</ref> virtually without dialogue<ref name=\"MMK&SL\"/> and which, renamed ''Silent Song'', won The [[Prix Italia]] award<ref>Adam Benedick and Sydney Newman [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peter-luke--obituaries-1569776.html Obituary: Peter Luke,] ''The Independent'', 26 January 1995</ref> in 1967 for 'original dramatic programmes' jointly with a French programme.<ref>[http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf \"Winners 1949-2010\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022124024/http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, Prix Italia official website</ref> The other O'Connor/Leonard work was ''The Retreat'' (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> These two plays starred [[Milo O'Shea]] and [[Jack McGowran]]. ''Cathy Come Home'' by [[Nell Dunn]] and [[Jeremy Sandford]] was offered to the Luke/Benedictus team who passed it on to [[Tony Garnett]].\n\n===Tony Garnett and Ken Loach===\nGarnett was quickly seen as someone capable of delivering plays which would gain much publicity for the BBC and its Drama department.<ref name=\"Lacey1\">Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.56</ref> He had the enthusiastic support of Newman, his immediate superior, who lobbied for increased funding to allow for more location shooting on film rather than shooting productions in the multi-camera electronic television studio, a practice which was felt to impair realism, the preferred mode.<ref name=\"Lacey1\"/>\n\nDirector [[Ken Loach]] made ten plays in all for ''The Wednesday Play'' series.<ref>Jacob Leigh ''The Cinema of Ken Loach: Art in the Service of the People'', London: Wallflower Press, 2002, p.195</ref> Two of them are among the best remembered of the entire run: an adaptation of [[Nell Dunn]]'s ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' (3 November 1965),<ref>Ros Cranston [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/440997/ \"Up the Junction (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and the saga of a homeless young couple and their battle to prevent their children being taken into local authority care: ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (16 November 1966).<ref>Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438481/ \"Cathy Come Home (1966)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> The latter began Loach's 13 year collaboration with Tony Garnett as his producer, although Garnett had been closely involved with ''Up the Junction'' as well.<ref>Jason Deans and Maggie Brown [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/28/tony-garnett-mother-backstreet-abortion-death \"Up the Junction's Tony Garnett reveals mother's backstreet abortion death\"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2013</ref>\n\nPlays like ''Up the Junction'' though were controversial among more conservative viewers. The 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] accused the BBC of portraying \"promiscuity as normal\" in ''Up the Junction''<ref name=\"Hayward\">Anthony Hayward [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/cathy-come-home-422630.html \"Cathy come home\",] ''The Independent'', 3 November 2006</ref> and ''The Wednesday Play'' as featuring \"Dirt, Doubt and Disbelief\".<ref>Asa Briggs ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume 5'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.519</ref> The writer on  television [[Anthony Hayward]] quoted Garnett in 2006: \"Mary Whitehouse was on the prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings.\"<ref name=\"Hayward\"/> The 'drama documentary' approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' article published before its first repeat transmission [[Grace Wyndham Goldie]] complained that ''Cathy Come Home'' \"deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ... [viewers] have a right to know whether what they are being offered is real or invented.\"<ref name=\"Lacey2\">Quoted by Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.57</ref> Loach has admitted that \"[w]e were very anxious for our plays not to be considered dramas but as continuations of the news\" which preceded ''The Wednesday Play''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s slot.<ref>Graham Fuller ''Loach on Loach'', London: Faber, 1998, p.15 cited in Samantha Lay ''British Social Realism: From Documentary to Brit-Grit'', London: WEallflower Press, 2002, p.21</ref>\n\n===Later seasons===\nThe last three years of the strand were predominantly produced by [[Irene Shubik]] and [[Graeme MacDonald]]; by this time the BBC Drama head Sydney Newman had left the BBC. Highlights from this period include several plays by [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]] such as ''[[In Two Minds]]'' (1 March 1967)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557285/ \"''In Two Minds'' (1967)\"], BFI Screenonline</ref> and ''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (10 April 1968)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/539459/ \"''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (1968)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and Potter's ''[[Son of Man (play)|Son of Man]]'' (16 April 1969),<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1056162/ \"''Son of Man'' (1969)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> a modern interpretation of the story of [[Jesus]].\n\nSuffering from declining audience figures, the run of ''The Wednesday Play'' ended in 1970 when the day of transmission changed, and the series morphed into ''[[Play for Today]]''.\n\n==Reputation and availability==\nIt is regarded as one of the most influential and successful programmes to be produced in Britain during the 1960s, and is still frequently referenced and discussed. In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] to find the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, two ''Wednesday Plays'' made the list: ''The War Game'' was placed twenty-seventh, and ''Cathy Come Home'' was voted the second greatest British television programme of the century.\n\nSome examples of ''The Wednesday Play'', such as ''[[The War Game]]'' (which was not screened by the BBC for 20 years) and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (1966), a television play exploring the theme of housing and homelessness, was according to filmmaker [[Roger Graef]] \"a giant wakeup call for the whole nation,\"<ref>Roger Graef [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/15/homelessness.communities \"Out of the box\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2006</ref> and some of the Potter plays, surfaced on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]; the Potter play, ''Alice'' was a bonus feature of a Region 1 DVD in 2010 of [[Jonathan Miller]]'s surrealist version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. The Ken Loach material has resurfaced in a ''Ken Loach at the BBC'' set. However, as with much British television of this era, many episodes are [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|lost]], leaving 76 surviving in the Archives<!-- Not necessarily the BBCs. --> (along with 3 with some surviving sequences) out of 170 transmitted.<ref>[http://lostshows.com/default.aspx?programme=af856159-e83f-4614-89e2-7e69b050cf42 ''Missing or incomplete episodes for programme ''The Wednesday Play''\"], lostshows.com</ref>\n\n==Productions==\nThis table is based on records in the BBC Genome archive of the Radio Times<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/</ref>. Titles that carried the tag 'The Wednesday Play' (or 'The Wednesday Play presenting') on the BBC listings for their first or subsequent transmission are included, along with some repeats where the initial broadcast was not branded 'The Wednesday Play', but the repeat was. Repeats of the individual productions are excluded. All episodes were broadcast on BBC1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Original Air Date\n! Title\n! Author(s)\n!

The book was first published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] on February 1, 1988, five months after the release of Jackson's 1987 ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' album, and named after Jackson's signature dance move, the [[moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]]. The book contains a foreword by [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]]. It reached number one on the ''[[New York Times Best Seller list]]''. The book was reissued by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] on October 13, 2009 following Jackson's [[Death of Michael Jackson|death]] on June 25, 2009.\n\n== Production ==\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who was an editor at Doubleday, secured the book deal and paid Jackson a $300,000 advance. As part of the deal Jackson wanted Onassis to write a foreword, which she initially refused not wanting her name on any books she worked on but agreed to three paragraphs. She also edited the book.<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jackson-jackieo/michael-jackson-book-a-headache-for-jackie-o-idUSTRE5631S420090704</ref> \nThe first [[manuscript]] of the book was written by Robert Hilburn and was refused by the publishers, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], because it lacked \"juicy details\".<ref name = \"campbell 93 197\"/> A second manuscript was written by Stephen Davis, which Jackson drastically edited.<ref name = \"campbell 93 197\"/> Jackson finally decided to write the book himself, with help from Shaye Areheart (although there were reports that Areheart later quit after Jackson threw a snake at her).<ref name = \"campbell 93 197\">Campbell (1993), p. 197</ref> \n\nDue to the public interest in Jackson, ''Moonwalk'' was prepared for publication in secret.

While rehearsing with [[The Jackson 5]], Jackson stated that when they messed up they \"got hit, sometimes with a belt, sometimes with a switch.\"<ref name=\"Firing your father isn't easy\" /> The singer added that his father was \"real strict\" and \"something of a mystery\".<ref name=\"Firing your father isn't easy\" /> In September 1988, Jackson telephoned his father to apologize for some of the material in the autobiography. He explained that he hadn't written the book himself and that the critical content was written by \"someone else\".<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 395</ref> The singer also reveals how much he has been hurt by the press, asking, \"What happened to truth?

The book was first published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] on February 1, 1988, five months after the release of Jackson's 1987 ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' album, and named after Jackson's signature dance move, the [[moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]]. The book contains a foreword by [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]]. It reached number one on the ''[[New York Times Best Seller list]]''. The book was reissued by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] on October 13, 2009 following Jackson's [[Death of Michael Jackson|death]] on June 25, 2009.\n\n== Production ==\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who was an editor at Doubleday, secured the book deal and paid Jackson a $300,000 advance. As part of the deal Jackson wanted Onassis to write a foreword, which she initially refused not wanting her name on any books she worked on but agreed to three paragraphs. She also edited the book<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jackson-jackieo/michael-jackson-book-a-headache-for-jackie-o-idUSTRE5631S420090704</ref>.  \nThe first [[manuscript]] of the book was written by Robert Hilburn and was refused by the publishers, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], because it lacked \"juicy details\".<ref name = \"campbell 93 197\"/> A second manuscript was written by Stephen Davis, which Jackson drastically edited.<ref name = \"campbell 93 197\"/> Jackson finally decided to write the book himself, with help from Shaye Areheart (although there were reports that Areheart later quit after Jackson threw a snake at her).<ref name = \"campbell 93 197\">Campbell (1993), p. 197</ref> \n\nDue to the public interest in Jackson, ''Moonwalk'' was prepared for publication in secret.

The two episodes were respectively first broadcast in January and December 1972 and were shot entirely on film and mostly on location in [[Bavaria]], with the first episode recorded in German and the second recorded in English and then dubbed into German.\n\n== Production ==\n\nWhile visiting the UK in the early 1970s, German entertainer and TV producer [[Alfred Biolek]] became aware of the Pythons and, excited by their innovative and absurd sketches, invited them to Germany in 1971  to write a special German episode of their ''Flying Circus'' show and to act in them. Despite mixed audience reception, a second episode was produced in 1972.\n\nAccording to producer Biolek, the Pythons were initially somewhat reluctant to the idea of going to Germany to produce comedy for a German audience.<ref name=\"deutschlandfunk.de\">{{cite web|last1=Biolek|first1=Alfred|title=Man musste den Monty Python \u00fcberzeugen, mitzumachen|language=German|url=http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/man-musste-den-monty-python-ueberzeugen-mitzumachen.694.de.html?dram:article_id=67657|website=deutschlandfunk.de|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> Biolek had only seen a few shows, but he was impressed with the concept of the Flying Circus. Specifically, it stood out to him that they were both good comedians and good actors\u2014a combination that Biolek rarely saw in the German comedy scene at the time.<ref name=BBCRadio>{{cite web|last1=Wehn|first1=Henning|title=Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus!|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010y1wr|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> Biolek arranged to meet with the Pythons in the BBC's bar in London to convince them \"with many arguments and even more gin tonics\"<ref name=\"deutschlandfunk.de\"/> to come to Germany for a brief visit. [[Eric Idle]] has described the conception of the specials as \"The Germans came to us and said 'Look, we haven't got a sense of humour, but we understand you do. Can we use yours?{{'\"}}<ref>{{Cite episode |title=[[Monty Python Live at Aspen]] |series=[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]] |isbn=0-7670-8566-3 |date=21 March 1998}}</ref> [[Terry Jones]] recalls Biolek's inquiry as an opportunity \"to do silly things in Germany\".<ref name=BBCRadio />\n\nThe Pythons agreed to visit Biolek in Munich in order to explore options for possible material, but did not want to commit at this point.<ref name=BBCRadio /> During their visit, the troupe wanted to get a better understanding of German culture and humour. In fact, the visit, and the resulting two shows \u201ccan be viewed as a considered attempt to broaden the stereotypical picture of Germans\u201d by the Pythons.<ref name=\"Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus\">{{cite book|last1=Sumera|first1=Adam|editor1-last=Dobrogoszcz|editor1-first=Tomasz|title=Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus|date=2014|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham}}</ref> [[Michael Palin]] also noted that \"All I know is that it reversed all one's prejudices. Python has done very, very well in Germany, and the movies do extremely well.&nbsp;... Whenever anyone says, you know, the Germans have no sense of humour, say no, hang on, hang on, they got Monty Python before a lot of other countries.\"<ref name=BBCRadio /> During their visit to Germany, the Pythons attended the [[Oktoberfest]] and [[Olympiastadion (Munich)|Olympiastadion]] in Munich, and also visited nearby [[Dachau concentration camp]].<ref name=BBCRadio /> The Pythons' visit to Germany in 1971 coincided with the widely celebrated 500th birthday of painter [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], and the group's second visit with the highly anticipated [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. Both events had an obvious impact on the material created by the Pythons for their first episode, including the ''Silly Olympics'' skit, and the ''[[Anita Ekberg]] Sings Albrecht D\u00fcrer'' skit, thus situating their style of humour in a local cultural context.\n\n''Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus'' was produced by Biolek and translator Thomas Woitkewitsch in co-production with [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]. The first episode was written in English, and then translated by Woitkewitsch.<ref name=\"Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus\"/> However, translating humour within this transnational production\u2014especially when based on [[idioms]]\u2014was a general challenge, as Palin recalls.<ref name=\"Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus\"/>\n\nSince none of the Pythons spoke German sufficiently, Woitkewitsch needed to provide them with phonetic transcriptions of the skits, which they then needed to learn by heart. Jones recalls that this posed a considerable challenge to the troupe; he also mentions that because of the rigorous repetition required in production, he was still able to recite the German version of \"[[The Lumberjack Song]]\" over forty years later.<ref name=BBCRadio /> \nDespite the coaching and re-iterative translation efforts, the Pythons' accents remained rather strong, and according to Woitkewitsch the overall pacing was off.<ref name=BBCRadio /> While these language issues may have contributed to the first show's weak critical reception, Woitkewitsch suggests that they also lent it a \"secret charm\".<ref name=BBCRadio />\n\nThe second episode was recorded in English due to aforementioned issues with the German accents and timing of some of the members; only [[John Cleese]] and Palin delivered their lines in German well enough to be easily understood by native speakers. The other Python performers all had very thick accents (particularly Jones), making them difficult to understand. In some cases the episode was broadcast with German subtitles.<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite book | author=[[Monty Python]].

The episode also featured [[Terry Gilliam]] taking more acting roles than before.\n\n== Sketches ==\nThe \"[[Colin \"Bomber\" Harris vs Colin \"Bomber\" Harris]]\" and \"Hearing Aid Shop\" sketches in the second show had previously featured in ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]''.\n\nFootage of the \"Silly Olympics,\" \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]],\" \"Flashers' Love Story,\" and \"[[The Philosophers' Football Match]]\" sketches from these German specials was regularly used to fill time between live stage performances,<ref name=BBCRadio /> as seen in ''[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]'' (the former two re-dubbed in English). \"Silly Olympics\" (minus the relay for the deaf part) and \"The Philosophers' Football Match\" were also used in the 2014 reunion shows at London's O2 arena.\n\nSeveral new sketches were written specifically for this show, including \"[[William Tell]]\", \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" and \"[[The Merchant of Venice]]\" as performed by a herd of cows. Only \"[[The Lumberjack Song]]\" was translated from the its original appearance on ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (Series 1, Episode 9), although \"Ten Seconds of Sex\" from the second show also appeared in Series 3, Episode 9 of ''Flying Circus'' around the same time.\n\nBoth Alfred Biolek and Thomas Woitkewitsch are featured in guest roles, while the German footballer [[Franz Beckenbauer]] makes an appearance in The Philosophers' Football Match skit.

Opinion surveys taken after the episode was broadcast revealed that 8% of the audience found the show to be very good, 15% found it to be very bad, and 43% found it to be good.<ref name=BBCRadio /> Producer Biolek recalls that \"This [the first show] was an absolute flop, it cannot be stated differently, as well as in terms of viewership and especially in terms of reviews.\"<ref name=\"Sch\u00fcren Verlag\">{{cite book|last1=Biolek|first1=Alfred|editor1-link=Kommen wir nun zu etwas v\u00f6llig anderem \u2013 40 Jahre Monty Python|title=Unter Ausschluss der \u00d6ffentlichkeit.

The ARD version of the first episode is missing the 6-minute \"Bavarian Restaurant\" sketch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.schnittberichte.com/schnittbericht.php?ID=520244|title=Comparison of the ARD and the DVD version of Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus, Episode 1|language=de-DE}}</ref> The ARD version of the second episode trims some shots, mostly from the 'The Tale of Happy Valley' sketch. On the other hand, the ARD version also features two sequences missing from the DVD version: 'Schwimmkurs mit Arthur Lustgarten' ''(Swimming Course with Arthur Lustgarten)'' and 'Eine wichtige Information f\u00fcr Raucher' ''(An Important Information for Smokers)''. Also, in the ARD version, Eric Idle's 'I Want A Hearing Aid' sketch has been moved to the end of the episode.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.schnittberichte.com/schnittbericht.php?ID=744979|title=Comparison of the ARD and the DVD version of Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus, Episode 2|language=de-DE}}</ref> \n\n== Media ==\nGuerilla Films released both episodes on a single VHS tape in 1998, available in either PAL or NTSC format. The American [[A&E Network]] used this release as the basis of their DVD releases of the same material, with the first episode being included on ''[[Monty Python Live]]'' and the second episode included on ''The Life of Python''. (This arrangement resulted in the second episode being omitted from A&E's otherwise-complete 16-DVD box set of ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''.)\n\nThe Australian DVD company Rainbow Entertainment also released both episodes on one DVD.\n\nThe Swiss publisher Haffmans released a hardbound book containing the scripts of both episodes, with introductions and essays by the German producers, in 1998. This book has not been translated into English as of 2007.\n\nBoth episodes have been shown on the [[Paramount Comedy Channel]] in the UK and on [[PBS]] in the USA in 2007.\n\nAs of April 2018, both episodes are available for streaming on Netflix.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a853026/monty-python-back-catalogue-netflix/|title=Monty Python back catalogue is streaming on Netflix now|last=Warner|first=Sam|date=2018-04-15|website=Digital Spy|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-04-07}}</ref>\n\nThe German DVD label Pidax has released the German DVD of the series in 2018.

The two episodes were respectively first broadcast in January and December 1972 and were shot entirely on film and mostly on location in [[Bavaria]], with the first episode recorded in German and the second recorded in English and then dubbed into German.\n\n== Production ==\n\nWhile visiting the UK in the early 1970s, German entertainer and TV producer [[Alfred Biolek]] became aware of the Pythons and, excited by their innovative and absurd sketches, invited them to Germany in 1971  to write a special German episode of their ''Flying Circus'' show and to act in them. Despite mixed audience reception, a second episode was produced in 1972.\n\nAccording to producer Biolek, the Pythons were initially somewhat reluctant to the idea of going to Germany to produce comedy for a German audience.<ref name=\"deutschlandfunk.de\">{{cite web|last1=Biolek|first1=Alfred|title=Man musste den Monty Python \u00fcberzeugen, mitzumachen|language=German|url=http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/man-musste-den-monty-python-ueberzeugen-mitzumachen.694.de.html?dram:article_id=67657|website=deutschlandfunk.de|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> Biolek had only seen a few shows, but he was impressed with the concept of the Flying Circus. Specifically, it stood out to him that they were both good comedians and good actors\u2014a combination that Biolek rarely saw in the German comedy scene at the time.<ref name=BBCRadio>{{cite web|last1=Wehn|first1=Henning|title=Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus!|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010y1wr|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> Biolek arranged to meet with the Pythons in the BBC's bar in London to convince them \"with many arguments and even more gin tonics\"<ref name=\"deutschlandfunk.de\"/> to come to Germany for a brief visit. [[Eric Idle]] has described the conception of the specials as \"The Germans came to us and said 'Look, we haven't got a sense of humour, but we understand you do. Can we use yours?{{'\"}}<ref>{{Cite episode |title=[[Monty Python Live at Aspen]] |series=[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]] |isbn=0-7670-8566-3 |date=21 March 1998}}</ref> [[Terry Jones]] recalls Biolek's inquiry as an opportunity \"to do silly things in Germany\".<ref name=BBCRadio />\n\nThe Pythons agreed to visit Biolek in Munich in order to explore options for possible material, but did not want to commit at this point.<ref name=BBCRadio /> During their visit, the troupe wanted to get a better understanding of German culture and humour. In fact, the visit, and the resulting two shows \u201ccan be viewed as a considered attempt to broaden the stereotypical picture of Germans\u201d by the Pythons.<ref name=\"Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus\">{{cite book|last1=Sumera|first1=Adam|editor1-last=Dobrogoszcz|editor1-first=Tomasz|title=Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus|date=2014|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham}}</ref> [[Michael Palin]] also noted that \"All I know is that it reversed all one's prejudices. Python has done very, very well in Germany, and the movies do extremely well.&nbsp;... Whenever anyone says, you know, the Germans have no sense of humour, say no, hang on, hang on, they got Monty Python before a lot of other countries.\"<ref name=BBCRadio /> During their visit to Germany, the Pythons attended the [[Oktoberfest]] and [[Olympiastadion (Munich)|Olympiastadion]] in Munich, and also visited nearby [[Dachau concentration camp]].<ref name=BBCRadio /> The Pythons' visit to Germany in 1971 coincided with the widely celebrated 500th birthday of painter [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], and the group's second visit with the highly anticipated [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. Both events had an obvious impact on the material created by the Pythons for their first episode, including the ''Silly Olympics'' skit, and the ''[[Anita Ekberg]] Sings Albrecht D\u00fcrer'' skit, thus situating their style of humour in a local cultural context.\n\n''Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus'' was produced by Biolek and translator Thomas Woitkewitsch in co-production with [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]. The first episode was written in English, and then translated by Woitkewitsch.<ref name=\"Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus\"/> However, translating humour within this transnational production\u2014especially when based on [[idioms]]\u2014was a general challenge, as Palin recalls.<ref name=\"Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus\"/>\n\nSince none of the Pythons spoke German sufficiently, Woitkewitsch needed to provide them with phonetic transcriptions of the skits, which they then needed to learn by heart. Jones recalls that this posed a considerable challenge to the troupe; he also mentions that because of the rigorous repetition required in production, he was still able to recite the German version of \"[[The Lumberjack Song]]\" over forty years later.<ref name=BBCRadio /> \nDespite the coaching and re-iterative translation efforts, the Pythons' accents remained rather strong, and according to Woitkewitsch the overall pacing was off.<ref name=BBCRadio /> While these language issues may have contributed to the first show's weak critical reception, Woitkewitsch suggests that they also lent it a \"secret charm\".<ref name=BBCRadio />\n\nThe second episode was recorded in English due to aforementioned issues with the German accents and timing of some of the members; only [[John Cleese]] and Palin delivered their lines in German well enough to be easily understood by native speakers. The other Python performers all had very thick accents (particularly Jones), making them difficult to understand. In some cases the episode was broadcast with German subtitles.<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite book | author=[[Monty Python]].

The episode also featured [[Terry Gilliam]] taking more acting roles than before.\n\n== Sketches ==\nThe \"[[Colin \"Bomber\" Harris vs Colin \"Bomber\" Harris]]\" and \"Hearing Aid Shop\" sketches in the second show had previously featured in ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]''.\n\nFootage of the \"Silly Olympics,\" \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]],\" \"Flashers' Love Story,\" and \"[[The Philosophers' Football Match]]\" sketches from these German specials was regularly used to fill time between live stage performances,<ref name=BBCRadio /> as seen in ''[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]'' (the former two re-dubbed in English). \"Silly Olympics\" (minus the relay for the deaf part) and \"The Philosophers' Football Match\" were also used in the 2014 reunion shows at London's O2 arena.\n\nSeveral new sketches were written specifically for this show, including \"[[William Tell]]\", \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" and \"[[The Merchant of Venice]]\" as performed by a herd of cows. Only \"[[The Lumberjack Song]]\" was translated from the its original appearance on ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (Series 1, Episode 9), although \"Ten Seconds of Sex\" from the second show also appeared in Series 3, Episode 9 of ''Flying Circus'' around the same time.\n\nBoth Alfred Biolek and Thomas Woitkewitsch are featured in guest roles, while the German footballer [[Franz Beckenbauer]] makes an appearance in The Philosophers' Football Match skit. The first skit of the first episode also features Claudia Doren, then an announcer at the Westdeutscher Rundfunk.<ref name=\"Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus\"/>\n\n==List of episodes==\n;Episode 1 (produced in 1971 and originally broadcast on [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD TV]] on 3 January 1972 at 9&nbsp;pm CET)\n\n*An Introduction to Monty Python By Frau Newsreader Claudia Doren\n*The Journey of The Olympic Flame\n*Monty Python\u2019s Guide to [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]\n*[[Anita Ekberg]] Sings Albrecht D\u00fcrer\n*\"[[The Merchant of Venice]]\" as performed by a herd of cows\n*Doctor Breeder\n*Flashers' Love Story (animated)\n*Little Red Riding Hood\n*Silly Olympics\n*''Stake Your Claim''\n*The Lumberjack Song with The Austrian Border Police\n*The Bavarian Restaurant\n\nEdited versions of the \"Little Red Riding Hood\" and \"Silly Olympics\" sketches were dubbed into English for use in the Python stage shows.

Opinion surveys taken after the episode was broadcast revealed that 8% of the audience found the show to be very good, 15% found it to be very bad, and 43% found it to be good.<ref name=BBCRadio /> Producer Biolek recalls that \"This [the first show] was an absolute flop, it cannot be stated differently, as well as in terms of viewership and especially in terms of reviews.\"<ref name=\"Sch\u00fcren Verlag\">{{cite book|last1=Biolek|first1=Alfred|editor1-link=Kommen wir nun zu etwas v\u00f6llig anderem \u2013 40 Jahre Monty Python|title=Unter Ausschluss der \u00d6ffentlichkeit.

The ARD version of the first episode is missing the 6-minute \"Bavarian Restaurant\" sketch<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.schnittberichte.com/schnittbericht.php?ID=520244|title=Comparison of the ARD and the DVD version of Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus, Episode 1|language=de-DE}}</ref>. The ARD version of the second episode trims some shots, mostly from the 'The Tale of Happy Valley' sketch. On the other hand, the ARD version also features two sequences missing from the DVD version: 'Schwimmkurs mit Arthur Lustgarten' ''(Swimming Course with Arthur Lustgarten)'' and 'Eine wichtige Information f\u00fcr Raucher' ''(An Important Information for Smokers)''. Also, in the ARD version, Eric Idle's 'I Want A Hearing Aid' sketch has been moved to the end of the episode.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.schnittberichte.com/schnittbericht.php?ID=744979|title=Comparison of the ARD and the DVD version of Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus, Episode 2|language=de-DE}}</ref> \n\n== Media ==\nGuerilla Films released both episodes on a single VHS tape in 1998, available in either PAL or NTSC format. The American [[A&E Network]] used this release as the basis of their DVD releases of the same material, with the first episode being included on ''[[Monty Python Live]]'' and the second episode included on ''The Life of Python''. (This arrangement resulted in the second episode being omitted from A&E's otherwise-complete 16-DVD box set of ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''.)\n\nThe Australian DVD company Rainbow Entertainment also released both episodes on one DVD.\n\nThe Swiss publisher Haffmans released a hardbound book containing the scripts of both episodes, with introductions and essays by the German producers, in 1998. This book has not been translated into English as of 2007.\n\nBoth episodes have been shown on the [[Paramount Comedy Channel]] in the UK and on [[PBS]] in the USA in 2007.\n\nAs of April 2018, both episodes are available for streaming on Netflix.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a853026/monty-python-back-catalogue-netflix/|title=Monty Python back catalogue is streaming on Netflix now|last=Warner|first=Sam|date=2018-04-15|website=Digital Spy|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-04-07}}</ref>\n\nThe German DVD label Pidax has released the German DVD of the series in 2018.

The Convention guarantees the free passage of civilian vessels in peacetime, and restricts the passage of naval ships not belonging to [[Black Sea]] states. The terms of the Convention have been a source of controversy over the years, most notably about the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Soviet Armed Forces|military]] access to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].\n\nSigned on 20 July 1936 at the [[Montreux Palace]] in Switzerland,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairmont.com/montreux/hotel-history/ |title=Le Montreux Palace over the years |publisher=Fairmont.com |date= |accessdate=2014-09-15}}</ref> the Convention permitted Turkey to remilitarise the Straits.

In 1923, the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] had demilitarised the Dardanelles and opened the Straits to unrestricted civilian and military traffic, under the supervision of the [[International Straits Commission]] of the [[League of Nations]].\n\nBy the late 1930s, the strategic situation in the Mediterranean had altered with the rise of [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]], which controlled the Greek-inhabited [[Dodecanese]] islands off the west coast of Turkey and had constructed fortifications on [[Rhodes]], [[Leros]] and [[Kos]]. The Turks feared that Italy would seek to exploit access to the Straits to expand its power into [[Anatolia]] and the Black Sea region. There were also fears of Bulgarian rearmament.<ref name=\"rozakis2\">Christos L. Rozakis, Petros N. Stagos, ''The Turkish Straits'', p. 101.

In the note, Turkish foreign minister [[Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras]] explained that the international situation had changed greatly since 1923. At that time, Europe had been moving towards disarmament and an international guarantee to defend the Straits. The [[Abyssinia Crisis]] of 1934\u201335, the denunciation by Germany of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and international moves towards rearmament meant that \"the only guarantee intended to guard against the total insecurity of the Straits has just disappeared in its turn.\" Indeed, Aras said, \"the Powers most closely concerned are proclaiming the existence of a threat of general conflagration.\"  The key weaknesses of the present regime were that the machinery for collective guarantees were too slow and ineffective, there was no contingency for a general threat of war and no provision for Turkey to defend itself. Turkey was therefore prepared\n\n{{quote |to enter into negotiations with a view to arriving in the near future at the conclusion of agreements for regulations of the regime of the Straits under the conditions of security which are indispensable for the inviolability of Turkey's territory, in most liberal spirit, for the constant development of commercial navigation between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.}}\n\nThe response to the note was generally favourable, and [[Australia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Japan]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] agreed to attend negotiations at [[Montreux]] in Switzerland, which began on 22 June 1936. Two major powers were not represented: Italy, whose aggressively expansionist policies had prompted the conference in the first place, refused to attend and the  [[United States]] declined even to send an observer.<ref name=\"rozakis\">Christos L.

The British favoured the continuation of a relatively restrictive approach, while the Turks sought a more liberal regime that reasserted their own control over the Straits and the Soviets proposed a regime that would guarantee absolute freedom of passage.

Articles 2\u20137 consider the passage of merchant ships. Articles 8\u201322 consider the passage of war vessels. The key principle of freedom of passage and navigation is stated in articles 1 and 2. Article 1 provides, \"The High Contracting Parties recognise and affirm the principle of freedom of passage and navigation by sea in the Straits\". Article 2 states, \"In time of peace, merchant vessels shall enjoy complete freedom of passage and navigation in the Straits, by day and by night, under any flag with any kind of cargo.\"\n\nThe International Straits Commission was abolished, authorising the full resumption of Turkish military control over the Straits and the refortification of the Dardanelles. Turkey was authorised to close the Straits to all foreign warships in wartime or when it was threatened by aggression. Also, it was authorised to refuse transit from merchant ships belonging to countries at war with Turkey.\n\nA number of highly-specific restrictions were imposed on what type of warships are allowed passage. Non-Black-Sea powers willing to send a vessel must notify Turkey 8 days prior of their sought passing. Also, no more than nine foreign warships, with a total aggregate tonnage of 15,000 tons, may pass at any one time. Furthermore, no single ship heavier than 10.000t can pass.<ref>http://www.mfa.gov.tr/site_media/html/montro-bogazlar-raporu-2014.pdf</ref> An aggregate tonnage of all non-Black Sea warships in the Black Sea must be no more than 30,000 tons (or 45,000 tons under special conditions), and they are permitted to stay in the Black Sea for no longer than twenty-one days.  Only Black Sea states may transit [[capital ship]]s of any tonnage, escorted by no more than two destroyers.\n\nUnder Article 12, Black Sea states are also allowed to send submarines through the Straits, with prior notice, as long as the vessels have been constructed, purchased or sent for repair outside the Black Sea. The less restrictive rules applicable to Black Sea states were agreed as, effectively, a concession to the Soviet Union, the only Black Sea state other than Turkey with any significant number of capital ships or submarines.<ref name=\"barlas\" /><ref name=\"churchill\">Robin Rolf Churchill, Alan Vaughan Lowe, ''The law of the sea'', p. 115.

They largely served Turkish and Soviet interests, enabling Turkey to regain military control of the Straits and assuring Soviet dominance of the Black Sea.<ref name=\"Goldblat\" /> Although the Convention restricted the Soviets' ability to send naval forces into the Mediterranean Sea, thereby satisfying British concerns about Soviet intrusion into what was considered a British sphere of influence, it also ensured that outside powers could not exploit the Straits to threaten the Soviet Union. That was to have significant repercussions during [[World War II]] when the Montreux regime prevented the [[Axis powers]] from sending naval forces through the Straits to attack the Soviet Union.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The Axis powers were thus severely limited in naval capability in their [[Black Sea Campaigns (1941\u201344)|Black Sea campaigns]], relying principally on small vessels that had been transported overland by rail and canal networks.\n\n[[Auxiliaries|Auxiliary vessels]] and armed merchant ships occupied a grey area, however, and the transit of such vessels through the straits led to friction between the Allies and Turkey. Repeated protests from Moscow and London led to the Turkish government banning the movements of \"suspicious\" Axis ships with effect from June 1944 after a number of German auxiliary ships had been permitted to transit the Straits.<ref>Christos L.

However, modern aircraft carriers are heavier than the 15,000 ton limit imposed on warships, making it impossible for non-Black Sea powers to transit modern aircraft carriers through the Straits.\n\nUnder Article 11, Black Sea states are permitted to transit [[capital ship]]s of any tonnage through the straits, but Annex II specifically excludes aircraft carriers from the definition of capital ship.  In 1936, it was common for battleships to carry [[scout plane|observation aircraft]].  Therefore, aircraft carriers were defined as ships that were \"designed or adapted primarily for the purpose of carrying and operating aircraft at sea.\" The inclusion of aircraft on any other ship does not classify it as an aircraft carrier.<ref>Wikisource. Montreux Convention (text)</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union designated its [[Kiev-class aircraft carrier|''Kiev''-class]] and [[Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier|''Kuznetsov''-class]] ships as \"[[aircraft cruiser|aircraft-carrying cruisers]]\" because these ships were armed with [[P-500 Bazalt|P-500]] and [[P-700 Granit|P-700]] cruise missiles, which also form the main armament of the [[Slava-class cruiser|''Slava''-class cruiser]] and the [[Kirov-class battlecruiser|''Kirov''-class battlecruiser]]. The result was that the Soviet Navy could send its aircraft-carrying cruisers through the Straits in compliance with the Convention, but at the same time the Convention denied access to [[NATO]] aircraft carriers, which exceeded the 15,000 ton limit.<ref>14 San Diego L.

It was repeatedly challenged by the Soviet Union during World War II and the [[Cold War]]. As early as 1939, [[Joseph Stalin]] sought to reopen the Straits Question and proposed joint Turkish and Soviet control of the Straits, complaining that \"a small state [i.e. Turkey] supported by Great Britain held a great state by the throat and gave it no outlet\".<ref>Deborah Welch Larson, ''Origins of Containment: A Psychological Explanation'', p. 203. Princeton University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-691-02303-4}}</ref> After the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] was signed by the Soviet Union and [[Nazi Germany]], the Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] informed his German counterparts that the Soviet Union wished to take military control of the Straits and establish its own military base there.<ref>Christos L. Rozakis, Petros N. Stagos, ''The Turkish Straits'', p. 44. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1987. {{ISBN|90-247-3464-9}}</ref> The Soviets returned to the issue in 1945 and 1946, demanding a revision of the Montreux Convention at a conference excluding most of the Montreux signatories, a permanent Soviet military presence and joint control of the Straits. That was firmly rejected by Turkey, despite an ongoing Soviet \"strategy of tension\". For several years after [[World War II]], the Soviets exploited the restriction on the number of foreign warships by ensuring that one of theirs was always in the Straits, thus effectively blocking any state other than Turkey from sending warships through the Straits.<ref>\"Montreux Convention (1936).\" ''The Companion to British History'', Routledge. 2001.</ref> Soviet pressure expanded into full demands to revise the Montreux Convention, which led to the [[Turkish Straits crisis]] of 1946, which led to Turkey abandoning its policy of neutrality. In 1947, it became the recipient of US military and economic assistance under the [[Truman Doctrine]] of [[containment]] and joined the [[NATO]] alliance, along with Greece, in 1952.<ref>\"Turkey 1.\" ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', 2004.</ref>\n\n===United States===\nThe passage of US warships through the Straits also raised controversy, as the convention forbids the transit of non-Black Sea nations' warships with guns of a [[caliber|calibre]] larger than eight inches (203&nbsp;mm). In the 1960s, the US sent warships carrying 420&nbsp;mm calibre [[ASROC]] missiles through the Straits, prompting Soviet protests. The Turkish government rejected the Soviet complaints, pointing out that guided missiles were not guns and that since such weapons had not existed at the time of the Convention, they were not restricted.<ref>Bing Bing Jia, ''The Regime of Straits in International Law'', p. 112.

As well as obvious environmental concerns, the Straits bisect the city of Istanbul, with over 14 million people living on its shores and so [[list of maritime incidents in the Turkish Straits|maritime incidents in the Straits]] pose a considerable risk to public safety. The Convention does not, however, make any provision for the regulation of shipping for the purposes of safety and environmental protection. In January 1994, the Turkish government adopted new \"Maritime Traffic Regulations for the Turkish Straits and the Marmara Region\". That introduced a new regulatory regime \"to ensure the safety of navigation, life and property and to protect the environment in the region\" but without violating the Montreux principle of free passage. The new regulations provoked some controversy when Russia, Greece, [[Cyprus]], [[Romania]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Bulgaria]] raised objections. However, they were approved by the [[International Maritime Organization]] on the grounds that they were not intended to prejudice \"the rights of any ship using the Straits under international law\". The regulations were revised in November 1998 to address Russian concerns.<ref>Gennady Chufrin, ''The Security of the Caspian Sea Region'', pp. 155\u2013156.

The Convention guarantees the free passage of civilian vessels in peacetime, and restricts the passage of naval ships not belonging to [[Black Sea]] states.

In 1923, the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] had demilitarised the Dardanelles and opened the Straits to unrestricted civilian and military traffic, under the supervision of the [[International Straits Commission]] of the [[League of Nations]].\n\nBy the late 1930s, the strategic situation in the Mediterranean had altered with the rise of [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]], which controlled the Greek-inhabited [[Dodecanese]] islands off the west coast of Turkey and had constructed fortifications on [[Rhodes]], [[Leros]] and [[Kos]]. The Turks feared that Italy would seek to exploit access to the Straits to expand its power into [[Anatolia]] and the Black Sea region. There were also fears of Bulgarian rearmament.<ref name=\"rozakis2\">Christos L. Rozakis, Petros N. Stagos, ''The Turkish Straits'', p. 101.

In the note, Turkish foreign minister [[Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras]] explained that the international situation had changed greatly since 1923. At that time, Europe had been moving towards disarmament and an international guarantee to defend the Straits. The [[Abyssinia Crisis]] of 1934\u201335, the denunciation by Germany of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and international moves towards rearmament meant that \"the only guarantee intended to guard against the total insecurity of the Straits has just disappeared in its turn.\" Indeed, Aras said, \"the Powers most closely concerned are proclaiming the existence of a threat of general conflagration.\"  The key weaknesses of the present regime were that the machinery for collective guarantees were too slow and ineffective, there was no contingency for a general threat of war and no provision for Turkey to defend itself. Turkey was therefore prepared\n\n{{quote |to enter into negotiations with a view to arriving in the near future at the conclusion of agreements for regulations of the regime of the Straits under the conditions of security which are indispensable for the inviolability of Turkey's territory, in most liberal spirit, for the constant development of commercial navigation between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.}}\n\nThe response to the note was generally favourable, and [[Australia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Japan]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] agreed to attend negotiations at [[Montreux]] in Switzerland, which began on 22 June 1936.

Article 1 provides, \"The High Contracting Parties recognise and affirm the principle of freedom of passage and navigation by sea in the Straits\". Article 2 states, \"In time of peace, merchant vessels shall enjoy complete freedom of passage and navigation in the Straits, by day and by night, under any flag with any kind of cargo.\"\n\nThe International Straits Commission was abolished, authorising the full resumption of Turkish military control over the Straits and the refortification of the Dardanelles. Turkey was authorised to close the Straits to all foreign warships in wartime or when it was threatened by aggression. Also, it was authorised to refuse transit from merchant ships belonging to countries at war with Turkey.\n\nA number of highly-specific restrictions were imposed on what type of warships are allowed passage. Non-Black-Sea powers willing to send a vessel must notify Turkey 8 days prior of their sought passing. Also, no more than nine foreign warships, with a total aggregate tonnage of 15,000 tons, may pass at any one time. Furthermore, no single ship heavier than 10.000t can pass<ref>http://www.mfa.gov.tr/site_media/html/montro-bogazlar-raporu-2014.pdf</ref>. An aggregate tonnage of all non-Black Sea warships in the Black Sea must be no more than 30,000 tons (or 45,000 tons under special conditions), and they are permitted to stay in the Black Sea for no longer than twenty-one days.  Only Black Sea states may transit [[capital ship]]s of any tonnage, escorted by no more than two destroyers.\n\nUnder Article 12, Black Sea states are also allowed to send submarines through the Straits, with prior notice, as long as the vessels have been constructed, purchased or sent for repair outside the Black Sea. The less restrictive rules applicable to Black Sea states were agreed as, effectively, a concession to the Soviet Union, the only Black Sea state other than Turkey with any significant number of capital ships or submarines.<ref name=\"barlas\" /><ref name=\"churchill\">Robin Rolf Churchill, Alan Vaughan Lowe, ''The law of the sea'', p. 115.

They largely served Turkish and Soviet interests, enabling Turkey to regain military control of the Straits and assuring Soviet dominance of the Black Sea.<ref name=\"Goldblat\" /> Although the Convention restricted the Soviets' ability to send naval forces into the Mediterranean Sea, thereby satisfying British concerns about Soviet intrusion into what was considered a British sphere of influence, it also ensured that outside powers could not exploit the Straits to threaten the Soviet Union. That was to have significant repercussions during [[World War II]] when the Montreux regime prevented the [[Axis powers]] from sending naval forces through the Straits to attack the Soviet Union.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The Axis powers were thus severely limited in naval capability in their [[Black Sea Campaigns (1941\u201344)|Black Sea campaigns]], relying principally on small vessels that had been transported overland by rail and canal networks.\n\n[[Auxiliaries|Auxiliary vessels]] and armed merchant ships occupied a grey area, however, and the transit of such vessels through the straits led to friction between the Allies and Turkey. Repeated protests from Moscow and London led to the Turkish government banning the movements of \"suspicious\" Axis ships with effect from June 1944 after a number of German auxiliary ships had been permitted to transit the Straits.<ref>Christos L.

However, modern aircraft carriers are heavier than the 15,000 ton limit imposed on warships, making it impossible for non-Black Sea powers to transit modern aircraft carriers through the Straits.\n\nUnder Article 11, Black Sea states are permitted to transit [[capital ship]]s of any tonnage through the straits, but Annex II specifically excludes aircraft carriers from the definition of capital ship.  In 1936, it was common for battleships to carry [[scout plane|observation aircraft]].  Therefore, aircraft carriers were defined as ships that were \"designed or adapted primarily for the purpose of carrying and operating aircraft at sea.\" The inclusion of aircraft on any other ship does not classify it as an aircraft carrier.<ref>Wikisource. Montreux Convention (text)</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union designated its [[Kiev-class aircraft carrier|''Kiev''-class]] and [[Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier|''Kuznetsov''-class]] ships as \"[[aircraft cruiser|aircraft-carrying cruisers]]\" because these ships were armed with [[P-500 Bazalt|P-500]] and [[P-700 Granit|P-700]] cruise missiles, which also form the main armament of the [[Slava-class cruiser|''Slava''-class cruiser]] and the [[Kirov-class battlecruiser|''Kirov''-class battlecruiser]]. The result was that the Soviet Navy could send its aircraft-carrying cruisers through the Straits in compliance with the Convention, but at the same time the Convention denied access to [[NATO]] aircraft carriers, which exceeded the 15,000 ton limit.<ref>14 San Diego L.

By allowing the Soviet aircraft carrying cruisers to transit the Straits, Turkey could leave the more restrictive Montreux Convention in place.<ref name=\"miller1990\"/>\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Soviet Union===\nThe Convention remains in force, but not without dispute. It was repeatedly challenged by the Soviet Union during World War II and the [[Cold War]]. As early as 1939, [[Joseph Stalin]] sought to reopen the Straits Question and proposed joint Turkish and Soviet control of the Straits, complaining that \"a small state [i.e. Turkey] supported by Great Britain held a great state by the throat and gave it no outlet\".<ref>Deborah Welch Larson, ''Origins of Containment: A Psychological Explanation'', p. 203. Princeton University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-691-02303-4}}</ref> After the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] was signed by the Soviet Union and [[Nazi Germany]], the Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] informed his German counterparts that the Soviet Union wished to take military control of the Straits and establish its own military base there.<ref>Christos L. Rozakis, Petros N. Stagos, ''The Turkish Straits'', p. 44. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1987. {{ISBN|90-247-3464-9}}</ref> The Soviets returned to the issue in 1945 and 1946, demanding a revision of the Montreux Convention at a conference excluding most of the Montreux signatories, a permanent Soviet military presence and joint control of the Straits. That was firmly rejected by Turkey, despite an ongoing Soviet \"strategy of tension\". For several years after [[World War II]], the Soviets exploited the restriction on the number of foreign warships by ensuring that one of theirs was always in the Straits, thus effectively blocking any state other than Turkey from sending warships through the Straits.<ref>\"Montreux Convention (1936).\" ''The Companion to British History'', Routledge. 2001.</ref> Soviet pressure expanded into full demands to revise the Montreux Convention, which led to the [[Turkish Straits crisis]] of 1946, which led to Turkey abandoning its policy of neutrality. In 1947, it became the recipient of US military and economic assistance under the [[Truman Doctrine]] of [[containment]] and joined the [[NATO]] alliance, along with Greece, in 1952.<ref>\"Turkey 1.\" ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', 2004.</ref>\n\n===United States===\nThe passage of US warships through the Straits also raised controversy, as the convention forbids the transit of non-Black Sea nations' warships with guns of a [[caliber|calibre]] larger than eight inches (203&nbsp;mm). In the 1960s, the US sent warships carrying 420&nbsp;mm calibre [[ASROC]] missiles through the Straits, prompting Soviet protests. The Turkish government rejected the Soviet complaints, pointing out that guided missiles were not guns and that since such weapons had not existed at the time of the Convention, they were not restricted.<ref>Bing Bing Jia, ''The Regime of Straits in International Law'', p. 112.

However, Turkey's longstanding refusal to sign UNCLOS has meant that Montreux remains in force without further amendments.<ref>\"Montreux Convention\".

Scarecrow Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8108-5078-8}}</ref>\n\nThe safety of vessels passing through the Bosporus has become a major concern in recent years as the volume of traffic has increased greatly since the Convention was signed: from 4,500 in 1934 to 49,304 by 1998. As well as obvious environmental concerns, the Straits bisect the city of Istanbul, with over 14 million people living on its shores and so [[list of maritime incidents in the Turkish Straits|maritime incidents in the Straits]] pose a considerable risk to public safety. The Convention does not, however, make any provision for the regulation of shipping for the purposes of safety and environmental protection. In January 1994, the Turkish government adopted new \"Maritime Traffic Regulations for the Turkish Straits and the Marmara Region\". That introduced a new regulatory regime \"to ensure the safety of navigation, life and property and to protect the environment in the region\" but without violating the Montreux principle of free passage. The new regulations provoked some controversy when Russia, Greece, [[Cyprus]], [[Romania]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Bulgaria]] raised objections. However, they were approved by the [[International Maritime Organization]] on the grounds that they were not intended to prejudice \"the rights of any ship using the Straits under international law\". The regulations were revised in November 1998 to address Russian concerns.<ref>Gennady Chufrin, ''The Security of the Caspian Sea Region'', pp. 155\u2013156.
