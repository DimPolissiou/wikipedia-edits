Bakeman was unable to prove his service; Gray, while able to prove his service, had only served six months; Fruits had never had any pension.<ref name=\"HR1044\" /><ref name=\"Pension\">{{cite web|url=http://revwarapps.org/s1464.pdf|title=S1464, Revolutionary War Pension Application for John Gray|date=January 12, 1855|author=Gray, John|website=revwarapps.org}}</ref>\n\nGray was born near the [[Mount Vernon (plantation)|Mount Vernon]] plantation, home of [[George Washington]], \"hero of the Revolution.\" His father, John Gray Sr., fought in the war and was killed in the [[Battle of White Plains]].

One of the founding members of the Finnish Salvation Army, she became aware of the effects of poverty and unsanitary conditions for new mothers. She established the first maternity home in Porvoo, published materials to educate women on childbirth and sanitation, and provided counseling for new mothers. Recognizing the needs of unwed mothers, she established one of the first homes to offer single mothers training and follow-up care so that they were able to provide for both the health and economic welfare of their families. Raising three foster daughters, as a single parent, she dedicated her time to helping mothers and children. In later life, she established a private retirement home for women.\n\n==Early life==\nAlva Forsius was born on 24 May 1866 on a farm in [[Porvoon maalaiskunta]] in what was the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] of the [[Russian Empire]] to Hulda Aurora Hollm\u00e9rus and Johan Wilhelm Forsius.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=5}}{{sfn|Forsblom|2012|p=8}} She was the second child in a family of twelve children. She attended the Porvoo Girls' School, completing her certificate in 1884 and then entered a two-year course in [[handicrafts]] at the Helsinki Teacher Training Center, as well as a course at the Helsinki School of Chemistry.{{sfn|Forsius|2015}}\n\n==Career==\nForsius began her career at the Porvoo Women's Crafts School, teaching sewing machine use.{{sfn|Forsius|2015}} She moved to Helsinki and grew concerned about the poverty in her neighborhood.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=6}} Having a strong desire to help others, she became a pioneer in establishing the Finnish [[Salvation Army]].{{sfn|Forsblom|2012|p=8}} The original idea of the organization came from Baroness [[Louise af Forselles]], who recruited Forsius, Hedvig von Haartman, and Constantin Boije af Genn\u00e4s and his wife to help her organize a Finnish branch{{sfn|Merritt|Satterlee|2017|p=171}} in late 1888. The group left in April 1889 to travel to England and study to become rescue officers and returned after a six-month training period.{{sfn|Forsius|2015}} Forsius spent a decade in the service and trained as a midwife before she resigned from the organization to focus on [[obstetrics]] in 1898.{{sfn|Forsblom|2012|p=8}}\n\nOn 17 April 1895, Forsius had graduated as a midwife from the Helsinki Obstetrics Hospital and began working throughout the countryside surrounding [[Porvoo]]. On 10 September 1898 she graduated from a technical course on the use of equipment to facilitate births and decided to open a private maternity clinic in Porvoo which offered safe and hygienic conditions for expectant mothers.{{sfn|Forsius|2015}}{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=7}} Her facility offered five beds, and received a city subsidy for providing services to the women of the community.{{sfn|Forsius|2015}} It was the first maternity hospital in Porvoo.{{sfn|Pukkila|2016}} Quickly she outgrew the facility and began planning a larger maternal home, which opened in 1902.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|pp=8\u20139}} The new facility had twelve beds and the city subsidy was increased accordingly.{{sfn|Forsius|2015}} In addition to a safe birthing environment, mothers were given instruction on childcare and hygiene. Each mother who left the facility received information on formula for increasing baby-birth weights and sterilized bottles.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=10}} In spite of the help she was able to give, Forsius felt that inadequate help was given, as there was not enough time in a [[lying-in]] facility for sufficient counseling or training, and she was moved by the plight of [[Single parent|unwed mothers]] who were rejected by society.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=10}}{{sfn|Pukkila|2016}} She also took in three of the children born at her facility, Anna Sofia (1900\u20131924), Marta Bernhardine (1905\u2013?) and Eva Elisabet (1912\u20132014).{{sfn|Forsius|2015}}{{sfn|Forsblom|2012|p=8}} She took in Anna as a foster child, but legally adopted Marta and Eva in 1929.{{sfn|Forsius|2015}}\n\nIn 1910, Forsius put the maternity hospital up for sale, but it was two years before a buyer was actually found.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=10}} In the meantime, she began work on developing an unwed mother's home. Her plan called for expectant mothers to receive nutritional help before the birth and then remain at the facility for up to six months after their child's birth so that they could receive education and training to provide for their family welfare during their stay{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=12}} and follow-up visits for up to three years after the child's birth to offer additional assistance.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=15}} She purchased a lot and built a large building which had four bedrooms, a parlor, a children's playroom, a dining room, office, kitchen and three balconies. Though she solicited donations, she was unable to furnish the structure and negotiated with the Salvation Army to run the home. She named the facility \"Solhem\" and it opened in 1914 at the beginning of [[World War I]], as one of the first facilities of its kind in the country.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|pp=13\u201314}}{{sfn|Forsblom|2012|p=8}} Mothers were charged a small fee, but most could not pay and were taught to make handicrafts and sell them to cover the costs. They grew their own food and shared communally in the chores to keep the home running.{{sfn|Forsblom|2012|p=8}}\n\nOver the next several years, Forsius focused on raising her daughters and continued publishing. She had published her first work, ''I v\u00e4ntade dagar, n\u00e5gra enkla r\u00e5d f\u00f6r blifvande m\u00f6drar'' (In coming days, some simple advice for future mothers) as a guide for expectant mothers in 1899. It was reprinted in 1900 and 1901 with variations in the title,{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|pp=15\u201316}} and was a detailed and practical guide giving information on abortion, breast care, childbirth, exercise, illness, miscarriage, nutrition, and sanitation.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=16}} In 1922, she published a volume of poetry, ''Fosterbarnen'' (Foster children) dedicated to her children.

One of the founding members of the Finnish Salvation Army, she became aware of the effects of poverty and unsanitary conditions for new mothers. She established the first maternity home in Porvoo, published materials to educate women on childbirth and sanitation, and provided counseling for new mothers. Recognizing the needs of unwed mothers, she established one of the first homes to offer single mothers training and follow-up care so that they were able to provide for both the health and economic welfare of their families. Raising three foster daughters, as a single parent, she dedicated her time to helping mothers and children. In later life, she established a private retirement home for women.\n\n==Early life==\nAlva Forsius was born on 24 May 1866 on a farm in [[Porvoon maalaiskunta]] in what was the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] of the [[Russian Empire]] to Hulda Aurora Hollm\u00e9rus and Johan Wilhelm Forsius.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=5}}{{sfn|Forsblom|2012|p=8}} She was the second child in a family of twelve children. She attended the Porvoo Girls' School, completing her certificate in 1884 and then entered a two-year course in [[handicrafts]] at the Helsinki Teacher Training Center, as well as a course at the Helsinki School of Chemistry.{{sfn|Forsius|2015}}\n\n==Career==\nForsius began her career at the Porvoo Women's Crafts School, teaching sewing machine use.{{sfn|Forsius|2015}} She moved to Helsinki and grew concerned about the poverty in her neighborhood.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=6}} Having a strong desire to help others, she became a pioneer in establishing the Finnish [[Salvation Army]].{{sfn|Forsblom|2012|p=8}} The original idea of the organization came from Baroness [[Louise af Forselles]], who recruited Forsius, Hedvig von Haartman, and Constantin Boije af Genn\u00e4s and his wife to help her organize a Finnish branch{{sfn|Merritt|Satterlee|2017|p=171}} in late 1888. The group left in April 1889 to travel to England and study to become rescue officers and returned after a six-month training period.{{sfn|Forsius|2015}} Forsius spent a decade in the service and trained as a midwife before she resigned from the organization to focus on [[obstetrics]] in 1898.{{sfn|Forsblom|2012|p=8}}\n\nOn 17 April 1895, Forsius had graduated as a midwife from the Helsinki Obstetrics Hospital and began working throughout the countryside surrounding [[Porvoo]]. On 10 September 1898 she graduated from a technical course on the use of equipment to facilitate births and decided to open a private maternity clinic in Porvoo which offered safe and hygienic conditions for expectant mothers.{{sfn|Forsius|2015}}{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=7}} Her facility offered five beds, and received a city subsidy for providing services to the women of the community.{{sfn|Forsius|2015}} It was the first maternity hospital in Porvoo.{{sfn|Pukkila|2016}} Quickly she outgrew the facility and began planning a larger maternal home, which opened in 1902.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|pp=8\u20139}} The new facility had twelve beds and the city subsidy was increased accordingly.{{sfn|Forsius|2015}} In addition to a safe birthing environment, mothers were given instruction on childcare and hygiene. Each mother who left the facility received information on formula for increasing baby-birth weights and sterilized bottles.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=10}} In spite of the help she was able to give, Forsius felt that inadequate help was given, as there was not enough time in a [[lying-in]] facility for sufficient counseling or training, and she was moved by the plight of [[Single parent|unwed mothers]] who were rejected by society.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=10}}{{sfn|Pukkila|2016}} She also took in three of the children born at her facility, Anna Sofia (1900\u20131924), Marta Bernhardine (1905\u2013?) and Eva Elisabet (1912\u20132014).{{sfn|Forsius|2015}}{{sfn|Forsblom|2012|p=8}} She took in Anna as a foster child, but legally adopted Marta and Eva in 1929.{{sfn|Forsius|2015}}\n\nIn 1910, Forsius put the maternity hospital up for sale, but it was two years before a buyer was actually found.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=10}} In the mean time, she began work on developing an unwed mother's home. Her plan called for expectant mothers to receive nutritional help before the birth and then remain at the facility for up to six months after their child's birth so that they could receive education and training to provide for their family welfare during their stay{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=12}} and follow-up visits for up to three years after the child's birth to offer additional assistance.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=15}} She purchased a lot and built a large building which had four bedrooms, a parlor, a children's playroom, a dining room, office, kitchen and three balconies. Though she solicited donations, she was unable to furnish the structure and negotiated with the Salvation Army to run the home. She named the facility \"Solhem\" and it opened in 1914 at the beginning of [[World War I]], as one of the first facilities of its kind in the country.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|pp=13\u201314}}{{sfn|Forsblom|2012|p=8}} Mothers were charged a small fee, but most could not pay and were taught to make handicrafts and sell them to cover the costs. They grew their own food and shared communally in the chores to keep the home running.{{sfn|Forsblom|2012|p=8}}\n\nOver the next several years, Forsius focused on raising her daughters and continued publishing. She had published her first work, ''I v\u00e4ntade dagar, n\u00e5gra enkla r\u00e5d f\u00f6r blifvande m\u00f6drar'' (In coming days, some simple advice for future mothers) as a guide for expectant mothers in 1899. It was reprinted in 1900 and 1901 with variations in the title,{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|pp=15\u201316}} and was a detailed and practical guide giving information on abortion, breast care, childbirth, exercise, illness, miscarriage, nutrition, and sanitation.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=16}} In 1922, she published a volume of poetry, ''Fosterbarnen'' (Foster children) dedicated to her children. Both the Finnish and Swedish language versions quickly sold out and it was reprinted the following year.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=17}} Two years later, in 1924, her first daughter, Anna, who had trained as a nurse, died.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=18}} She published many articles on childbirth and an annual report ''Barnb\u00f6rd shuset i Borg\u00e5'' (Childbirth statistics in Porvoo), which gave the numbers of patients treated, length of treatment, illnesses and number of babies born.{{sfn|Vuorenniemi|2015|p=21}}\n\nIn 1925, Forsius founded a facility to care for aging women called ''sivistyneiden naisten vanhainkotia'' (Sophisticated Aging Women's Home) as there were very few private retirement homes in Finland.

Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats in its external appearance. In fact, it is characterized by several [[mustelid]] features\u2014an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the domestic cat, the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014red and gray.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. The jaguarundi feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, rodents and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US.

The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks.

'''jaguarundi''' (''Herpailurus yagouaroundi'') ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) is a wild [[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats in its external appearance. In fact, it is characterized by several [[mustelid]] features\u2014an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the domestic cat, the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014red and grey.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. The jaguarundi feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, rodents and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

In captivity, females in [[estrus]] have been observed making faint sounds as they [[scent mark]] the area around their enclosures.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/> \n\n===Diet===\n[[File:Puma yagouaroundi, ZOO Praha 254.jpg|thumb|Jaguarundis are [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] carnivores.]]\nThe jaguarundi typically feed on small-sized prey weighing less than {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, including ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Jaguarundis will also take larger prey such as domestic poultry, fish, [[marmoset]]s, rabbits and [[opossum]]s; a study recorded small deer (possibly [[carrion]]) in the diet. Vegetation such as grasses have also been recorded in their diet.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/><ref name=ms/> A study showed jaguarundis take {{convert|400|g|oz|abbr=on}} vertebrate prey on an average everyday.<ref name=ms/> The broad array of prey recorded for the jaguarundi across its range and varying proportions of different prey in its diet could indicate that the cat tends to feed on the most abundant and easily catchable prey in the area.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nJaguarundis have been observed mating all year round, with peaks at different times of the year across the range; for instance, in Mexico breeding peaks in January and March. Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. It can also occur in [[cloud forest]]s, [[mangrove]]s and [[savanna]]s.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=ceballos/> Unlike the [[Sympatry|sympatric]] [[margay]], [[ocelot]] and [[oncilla]], the jaguarundi can occur in open areas as well. In open habitats the jaguarundi prefers areas with vegetative cover such as cacti, which would generally be difficult for possible predators to penetrate; there may be a few clearings at the periphery of such areas. Jaguarundis tend to stay close to a source of running water.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=fws.gov/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coronado-Quibrera |first1=W.P. |last2=Olmos-Oropeza |first2=G. |last3=Bender |first3=L.C. |last4=Rosas-Rosas |first4=O.C. |last5=Palacio-N\u00fa\u00f1ez |first5=J. |last6=Tarango-Ar\u00e1mbula |first6=L.A. |last7=Herrera-Haro |first7=J.G. |title=Adaptability of the threatened jaguarundi (''Herpailurus yagouaroundi'' Schereber, 1777) to human-altered environments in San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico |journal=Acta Zool\u00f3gica Mexicana |date=2019 |volume=35 |pages=1\u201315 |doi=10.21829/azm.2019.3502210 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/310f/6597fd914eb664e160637b4b1b1d57d87fe7.pdf}}</ref> The jaguarundi is noted for its resistance to environmental disturbances in its habitat; it can successfully thrive in reforested areas.<ref name=ceballos/> While commonly inhabiting lowlands up to {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the sea level, this cat has been reported at elevations as high as {{convert|3200|m|ft|abbr=on}} in Colombia.<ref name=iucn/>\n\nThe range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the Andes\u2014second only to the cougar in the [[Latitude|latitudinal]] extent of its distribution.
