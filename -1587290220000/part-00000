As a child he experienced the famine in [[Mount Lebanon]] at the end of [[World War I]]. He was educated in [[Bikfayya]] before attending the Jesuit College of St Joseph in [[Beirut]] from 1923 to 1927. He became a journalist, becoming editorial secretary of the nationalist [[Damascus]]-based newspaper ''[[al-Qabas]]'' in 1931. He married the daughter of a Lebanese merchant and qualified as a lawyer before returning to Beirut in 1933. Until 1941 he worked as editorial secretary of the new daily newspaper ''[[al-Nahar]]''. In 1941, after a month's imprisonment as a result of his nationalist activities, he founded ''al-Jadid'', a weekly which soon became a daily, and which continued until 1946.<ref name=\"AllenLowry20102\" />\n\nIn 1946 he was invited to join the Lebanese diplomatic service. He served in a wide range of postings, retiring in 1975 as Lebanese Ambassador to Italy. He chose to stay in Lebanon during the 1975-90 [[Lebanese Civil War]], losing manuscripts and correspondence when his Beirut flat was bombed in 1976. He died in a bomb blast in 1989.<ref name=\"AllenLowry20102\" />\n\n== Early life ==\nHis writing contributed in numerous newspaper articles including [[Al Bayan (newspaper)|al-Bay\u0101n]] (in Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646) for Bu\u1e6drus al-Bust\u0101n\u012b, as well as al-Nid\u0101\u2019 (in Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0621)for Kazem al Soleh. Tawfiq even wrote short stories that were inspired by the streets he lived in. It was only later in his life when Tawfiq began writing political articles instead of creative works and poems. He then traveled to Damascus where he was employed as a reporter for al- Bayraq (in Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0642) and [[Al-Qabas|al- Qabas]] (in Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0628\u0633) newspaper. He went on to enroll in a law Institute in which he received his Law degree. However, even after completing his degree, he did not begin practicing his profession.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nal-Nahar, a newspaper company established by [[Gebran Tueni|Jubran Tuwayn\u012b]] in 1933 was where Tawfiq wrote his articles until 1941. He wrote stories and articles that revolved around the crimes happening in Lebanon. He also wrote about his thoughts concerning literature, politics, and social issues.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Childhood ===\nTawfiq\u2019s father worked as a real estate expert as well as a building contractor and his mother was born into a conservative village. Tawfiq\u2019s early life and childhood was heavily impacted by [[World War I]], which began when he was around three years old. The [[Great Famine of Mount Lebanon|1916 famine in Mount Lebanon]] forced Tawfiq and his family to leave their hometown and move to [[Zahl\u00e9|Zahle]], where his father decided to reestablish their losses by opening a small restaurant. Unfortunately, around that time there was a new fever outbreak in the city of Zahle, and Tawfiq\u2019s family had no choice but to go back to the village they had to abandon before.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Education ===\nThe school, \u201cFriends\u201d in [[Brummana|Broumana]], taught Tawfiq how to read and write, as well as many other elementary skills. He then returned to Bharsaf village where he enrolled in the Mar Yousuf Church school. He later transferred to another school called \u201cal Abaa\u2019 al Yasouein\u201d (Jesuit Fathers in English and \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0633\u0648\u0639\u064a\u064a\u0646 in Arabic) in [[Bikfaya|Bakfaya]] where he received his official elementary education. In 1924, Tawfiq enrolled in the institution of \u201cal Abaa\u2019 al Yasouein\u201d in Beirut where he continued working as a writer for al-\u2018Ar\u012bs (in Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u064a\u0633) newspaper and al-Barq (in Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0642) newspaper. In 1927 he completed his [[Bachelor's degree|Baccalaureate degree]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Hobbies ===\nHis hobbies involved reading Arabic and French literature. His passion for literature encouraged him to take part in plays that were put on at the end of every scholastic year. During his free time, he would create impressions of inanimate objects that surrounded him, which later inspired and became the basis of one of his novels \u201cal- Raghif (The Loaf)\u201d. At 15 years old, he began writing poems in al-\u2018Ar\u012bs newspaper, which was owned by Abdallah Hashima.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Later life ==\nTawfiq retired and returned to Lebanon, Bharsaf, in 1975. During that time period, Tawfiq lived throughout the [[Lebanese Civil War|Lebanese civil war]] and was trying to call for peace. He wrote his autobiography in a collection of stories called \"Husad al Aomor\". In 1984, Tawfiq decided to stop writing. The frequent bombing incidents occurring in Lebanon gave Tawfiq reason to flee his home and hide in the Spanish embassy in Lebanon, knowing that his son-in-law was the Spanish ambassador in Lebanon. Tawfiq Yusuf \u2018Awwad passed away in 1989 as a result of a targeted bombing directed towards the Spanish embassy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Diplomatic Life ===\nAfter working in [[Argentines|Argentine]] as a Lebanese Ambassador for two years, he traveled to Iran for the same job opportunity. Tawfiq\u2019s most memorable experience in Iran was his visit to the city [[Qom]]. In 1945, he moved to the [[Madrid|city of Madrid]], Spain, where he remained for three years. In Madrid, Tawfiq visited the [[El Escorial|El Escorial library]] where he discovered the glories of the Arab. After staying in Madrid, Tawfiq went to Cairo, Egypt where he lived through the [[Suez Crisis]]. His stay in [[Egypt]] lasted until 1959. After that, he went to Mexico and stayed for one year. After moving from country to country, he returned to his hometown, Lebanon, where he worked as the director of social and cultural affairs for around six years.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== His writing ==\nEven though \u2018Awwad in many styles of writing, he did not seem to give as much weight to his poetry relative to his other works of literature. However, he did not completely forget about poetry, and this style was reinforced in some stories such as \u201cAl Saaeh w Al Torjoman,\u201d and \u201cHasad al Oomor.\u201d The latter included 21 poem verses that were inspired by personal experiences, most of which included flirtatious and loving encounters.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe spoke of his poems as \u201cweighted messages\u201d and said he believes poets have the right to deviate from the normal standards a writer is expected to abide by. His poetry was unique due to its strength, sweet rhythm, as well as his attention to detail, and the description of these details in a humorous manner.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTawfiq Yusuf \u2018Awwad published \u201cKawafel al Zaman,\u201d short-stories grouped together which were gifted to his life-long friend. According to him, they were organized chronologically in a manner relating to his \u201clife-time summary from the bottom of his heart\u201d that included his purest and most raw thoughts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== His writing style ===\nHis talent was almost always recognized through his works of journalism. His ability to relatively excel in his articles was likely due to the fact that he began writing journalist-style at a very young age, so his skilled evolved for the better over time and made it easy for him to write these articles when he grew older.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis writing was also recognized due to his ability to make words sound beautiful and gave them new meanings throughout his works. His word choice was always expressive and detailed, giving readers an efficient way to perceive the situation they\u2019re reading about. His articles were fun to read because he wrote spontaneously, clearly, and humorously. Before submitting anything for publishing, he read his work over and over again, attempting to do so through the different perspectives of his potential readers. He strongly felt that if he didn\u2019t believe his article was a good read, neither would his audience. \u2018Awwad said \u201cI write which means I am,\u201d as well as \u201cwords in my mouth taste like kisses.\u201d <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTawfiq says the most difficult writing style is attempting to incorporate the subtle differences in slang while writing a conversational dialogue, and sometimes adding formal language to the discussion.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== His love for writing ===\nAwwad says he was in love with the words he wrote. He also mentioned the way he wrote in the same way he loved, that the words to his were his lover. He also warned himself from falling into the trap that comes with this love of words like women. He says women can be powerful, seductive, devious, and that he always needed to make sure that he was in control of his words, and not the other way around.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Works and Accomplishments==\n\n===Short story collections===\n* ''al-Sabi al a'raj'' (The Limping Boy), 1936\n* ''Qamis al-suf'' (The Woollen Shirt), 1937\n* ''al-'Adhara'' (The Virgins), 1944\n* ''Matar al-Saki'' (Frosty Airport), 1982\n\n===Novels===\n* ''al-Raghif'' (The Loaf), 1939.\n\nOne of Tawfiq Yusuf Awwad\u2019s best Arabic fictional novels is ''The Loaf''. It revolves around the events during World War I, where the people of Syria and Lebanon resisted the Turks. This time resembles an important date in Arab history which is identified in the novel. The novel gives important implications which are especially relevant to this era, where nationalists have risen and made their voices heard in the Arab countries. ''The Loaf'' discusses possible interventions and solutions fit for significant events taking place today. Awwad writes that \u201cArabs are still striving for a loaf of bread\u201d, implying that imperialism still holds power over Arab countries and that Arabs are striving for freedom and independence. The novel, however, faces two popular criticisms. The first being that ''The Loaf'' has details that are irrelevant to the narrative, and the second being that the author often disrupts the flow of the narrative when he tries to explain the action. On the contrary, the novel is well balanced between psychological analysis and dramatic sensitivity, placing it high on the list of Arabic novels.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Modern Arabic Literature|last=Allen|first=Roger|publisher=The Ungar Publishing Company|year=1987|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n*''Tawahin Bayrut'', 1972. Translated as ''Death in Beirut'', 1976.\n\nDeath in Beirut, also called The Mills of Beirut, is Tawfiq Yusuf Awwad\u2019s second novel. The story takes place in Lebanon, years after the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. It follows the heroine, Tamima Nassour, a [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]] teenage girl who leaves her village of Mahdiyaa in southern Lebanon to enroll in university in Beirut. The author uses her journey to show the challenges and cultural changes faced by the Lebanese youth in the aftermath of the war and the Israeli raids on Fedayeen (Arab guerrillas). The aim of the novel is to show the cultural transformation of the modern Lebanese society. Tawfiq, who writes with great sensitivity, used his strength of having a long experience of art and life to choose the subject for this novel and capture it in writing. The author, trying to picture the realities of life in Lebanon, follows the footsteps of realists. The novel displays two panoramas: a historical documentation of Lebanon and a poetic description of the characters\u2019 struggles.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDuring Tamima\u2019s journey at university, she gets caught up in student demonstrations, gets seduced by a rebellious writer, Ramzi Raad, and falls in love with a Christian, Maronite Hani Raai, who lived in Deir Mutil in northern Lebanon. Like most other students, she also had a part-time job to meet her financial needs. The bulk of the novel revolves around her ruthless brother, Jaber Nassour, her growing friendship with Mary Abu-Khalil, and her love for Hani. The climax of the novel was when Hani rejected Tamima after he found out about her past. After several setbacks, Tamima gains wisdom and realizes that her freedom is nothing without the freedom of others. Thus, she decides to join forces with the revolution and change. She then joins the Fedayeen, determined to see though the lies and deceit, and as a result, gradually begins to lose her innocence. Death in Beirut ends with having her career ended, in hopes of fighting for a bigger purpose, ending her intellectual growth.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe novel is written in the third person omniscient point of view, allowing Awwad to explore the conflicts faced in Beirut and the fates of characters in which their fortunes are linked to Tamima\u2019s life. However, the audience is also exposed to Tamima\u2019s inner thoughts as there are moments in the novel of Tamima\u2019s diary. The author does not use an authorial voice to deliver his message, instead, he accomplishes it through human relationships. When analyzing the language of the novel, Awwad uses intense poetic imagery, especially when describing the scene of Tamima getting seductued by Hani, as compared to other Arabic novels. Death in Beirut successfully explores the relationship of people with different religious backgrounds in a distressed community and describes the tragic historical events following the war of 1967 in Lebanon.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Miscellaneous works ===\n\n* Play: The Tourist and The Guide\n\nIn the play, The Tourist and the Guide, the author introduces it by stating that he wants the actors to portray Gods living among mankind, and even on a level greater \"than the gods of Baalbek.\u201d By doing so, the play would be greater than the usual play. The play is not realistic, except in the way the dialogue is fashioned. It belongs to the genre of intellectual drama, where Awwad is acknowledged as the pioneer. Due to his use of intellectual dialogue, the author is determined that the actors be on the level of Gods. In contrast to Ancient Greek, where mankind and the Gods lived in harmony and interact with each other, the author is eager to find philosophical problems faced by mankind in which may cause the Gods distress. The characters of the Tourist and the Guide include the tourist, who came from the other side of the world to visit the ruins of Baalbek, the sculptor, and a man who symbolized the people of the future. The script, unlike normal scripts that are divided into acts, is divided into three sections: arrival, visit and return. As for the acting content of the play, it is not packed with action, rather the intellectual dialogue is what masks the play. The dialogue, although full of discussion of ideas, is dramatized by bursts of imagery and poetry. This play, different from his fiction novels, shows maturity in his thoughts, language, and through his use of imagery.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Political Views and Influences ==\n\n=== Influences on Writing ===\nTawfiq \u2018Awwad\u2019s childhood was heavily influenced by the stories read to him by his grandmother in the children\u2019s book \u201calf Layla wa Layla.\u201d \u00a0His inspiration later came from French novelists as well as Arab writers and poets such as [[Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani|Ab\u016b al-Faraj al-I\u1e63bah\u0101n\u012b]] (\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0641\u0647\u0627\u0646\u064a), [[Al-Mutanabbi|Al- Mutanabi]] and [[Al-Jahiz|Al- Jahiz]]. His creativeness was not only shaped by stories and other writers, but also his diplomatic life and travels which gave a new type of enrichment to his works.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Tawfiq 'Awwad as a Storyteller ====\nTawfiq \u2018Awwad was a storyteller who wrote both short and long stories which reflected his own life-story, personal experiences, memories, and attitudes that he has expressed and experienced throughout his entire life.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn \u201cal Raghif,\u201d he spoke about poverty that stroke during World War I due to the \u201cal Jarad\u201d invasion of Mount Lebanon in 1916. Tawfiq also dealt with and wrote about other issues including the struggle that the Lebanese people faced before their independence from the [[History of Lebanon under Ottoman rule|Ottoman]] occupation. One of those struggles included the hangings of many revolutionists. From these events that Tawfiq witnessed, he was able to perfectly capture and depict the poverty, misery, and struggle that came while fighting for independence, as well as the ignorance that came on the government\u2019s behalf.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Tawfiq \u2018Awwad as a Journalist and Critic ====\nHe established his own journal and named it \u201cal Jadid.\u201d Tawfiq had his own unique way of dealing with social issues concerning the public, always taking on an objective perception by taking into consideration all points of view regarding the issue. His ultimate aim was an attempt to eliminate racism and create national parties that involved peace.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Awwad, Tawfiq Yusuf}}\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:1988 deaths]]\n[[Category:Lebanese journalists]]\n[[Category:Lebanese male short story writers]]\n[[Category:Lebanese short story writers]]\n[[Category:Lebanese novelists]]\n[[Category:Lebanese diplomats]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of Lebanon to Italy]]\n[[Category:People from Matn District]]\n", "text_old": "'''Tawfiq Yusuf 'Awwad''' (28 November 1911 &#x2013; 1989) (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] \u062a\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0642 \u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641 \u0639\u0648\u0627\u062f) was a [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] writer and diplomat.

In 1924, Tawfiq enrolled in the institution of \u201cal Abaa\u2019 al Yasouein\u201d in Beirut where he continued working as a writer for al-\u2018Ar\u012bs (in Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u064a\u0633) newspaper and al-Barq (in Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0642) newspaper. In 1927 he completed his [[Bachelor's degree|Baccalaureate degree]]. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Hobbies ===\nHis hobbies involved reading Arabic and French literature. His passion for literature encouraged him to take part in plays that were put on at the end of every scholastic year. During his free time, he would create impressions of inanimate objects that surrounded him, which later inspired and became the basis of one of his novels \u201cal- Raghif (The Loaf)\u201d. At 15 years old, he began writing poems in al-\u2018Ar\u012bs newspaper, which was owned by Abdallah Hashima. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Later Life ==\nTawfiq retired and returned to Lebanon, Bharsaf, in 1975. During that time period, Tawfiq lived throughout the [[Lebanese Civil War|Lebanese civil war]] and was trying to call for peace. He wrote his autobiography in a collection of stories called \"Husad al Aomor\". In 1984, Tawfiq decided to stop writing. The frequent bombing incidents occurring in Lebanon gave Tawfiq reason to flee his home and hide in the Spanish embassy in Lebanon, knowing that his son-in-law was the Spanish ambassador in Lebanon. Tawfiq Yusuf \u2018Awwad passed away in 1989 as a result of a targeted bombing directed towards the Spanish embassy. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Diplomatic Life ===\nAfter working in [[Argentines|Argentine]] as a Lebanese Ambassador for two years, he traveled to Iran for the same job opportunity. Tawfiq\u2019s most memorable experience in Iran was his visit to the city [[Qom]]. In 1945, he moved to the [[Madrid|city of Madrid]], Spain, where he remained for three years. In Madrid, Tawfiq visited the [[El Escorial|El Escorial library]] where he discovered the glories of the Arab. After staying in Madrid, Tawfiq went to Cairo, Egypt where he lived through the [[Suez Crisis]]. His stay in [[Egypt]] lasted until 1959. After that, he went to Mexico and stayed for one year. After moving from country to country, he returned to his hometown, Lebanon, where he worked as the director of social and cultural affairs for around six years. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== His writing ==\nEven though \u2018Awwad in many styles of writing, he did not seem to give as much weight to his poetry relative to his other works of literature. However, he did not completely forget about poetry, and this style was reinforced in some stories such as \u201cAl Saaeh w Al Torjoman,\u201d and \u201cHasad al Oomor.\u201d The latter included 21 poem verses that were inspired by personal experiences, most of which included flirtatious and loving encounters. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe spoke of his poems as \u201cweighted messages\u201d and said he believes poets have the right to deviate from the normal standards a writer is expected to abide by. His poetry was unique due to its strength, sweet rhythm, as well as his attention to detail, and the description of these details in a humorous manner. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTawfiq Yusuf \u2018Awwad published \u201cKawafel al Zaman,\u201d short-stories grouped together which were gifted to his life-long friend. According to him, they were organized chronologically in a manner relating to his \u201clife-time summary from the bottom of his heart\u201d that included his purest and most raw thoughts. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== His writing style ===\nHis talent was almost always recognized through his works of journalism. His ability to relatively excel in his articles was likely due to the fact that he began writing journalist-style at a very young age, so his skilled evolved for the better over time and made it easy for him to write these articles when he grew older. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis writing was also recognized due to his ability to make words sound beautiful and gave them new meanings throughout his works. His word choice was always expressive and detailed, giving readers an efficient way to perceive the situation they\u2019re reading about. His articles were fun to read because he wrote spontaneously, clearly, and humorously. Before submitting anything for publishing, he read his work over and over again, attempting to do so through the different perspectives of his potential readers. He strongly felt that if he didn\u2019t believe his article was a good read, neither would his audience. \u2018Awwad said \u201cI write which means I am,\u201d as well as \u201cwords in my mouth taste like kisses.\u201d <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTawfiq says the most difficult writing style is attempting to incorporate the subtle differences in slang while writing a conversational dialogue, and sometimes adding formal language to the discussion.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== His love for writing ===\nAwwad says he was in love with the words he wrote. He also mentioned the way he wrote in the same way he loved, that the words to his were his lover. He also warned himself from falling into the trap that comes with this love of words like women. He says women can be powerful, seductive, devious, and that he always needed to make sure that he was in control of his words, and not the other way around. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Works and Accomplishments==\n\n===Short story collections===\n* ''al-Sabi al a'raj'' (The Limping Boy), 1936\n* ''Qamis al-suf'' (The Woollen Shirt), 1937\n* ''al-'Adhara'' (The Virgins), 1944\n* ''Matar al-Saki'' (Frosty Airport), 1982\n\n===Novels===\n* ''al-Raghif'' (The Loaf), 1939.\n\nOne of Tawfiq Yusuf Awwad\u2019s best Arabic fictional novels is ''The Loaf''. It revolves around the events during World War I, where the people of Syria and Lebanon resisted the Turks. This time resembles an important date in Arab history which is identified in the novel. The novel gives important implications which are especially relevant to this era, where nationalists have risen and made their voices heard in the Arab countries. ''The Loaf'' discusses possible interventions and solutions fit for significant events taking place today. Awwad writes that \u201cArabs are still striving for a loaf of bread\u201d, implying that imperialism still holds power over Arab countries and that Arabs are striving for freedom and independence. The novel, however, faces two popular criticisms. The first being that ''The Loaf'' has details that are irrelevant to the narrative, and the second being that the author often disrupts the flow of the narrative when he tries to explain the action. On the contrary, the novel is well balanced between psychological analysis and dramatic sensitivity, placing it high on the list of Arabic novels. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Modern Arabic Literature|last=Allen|first=Roger|publisher=The Ungar Publishing Company|year=1987|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n*''Tawahin Bayrut'', 1972. Translated as ''Death in Beirut'', 1976.\n\nDeath in Beirut, also called The Mills of Beirut, is Tawfiq Yusuf Awwad\u2019s second novel. The story takes place in Lebanon, years after the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. It follows the heroine, Tamima Nassour, a [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]] teenage girl who leaves her village of Mahdiyaa in southern Lebanon to enroll in university in Beirut. The author uses her journey to show the challenges and cultural changes faced by the Lebanese youth in the aftermath of the war and the Israeli raids on Fedayeen (Arab guerrillas). The aim of the novel is to show the cultural transformation of the modern Lebanese society. Tawfiq, who writes with great sensitivity, used his strength of having a long experience of art and life to choose the subject for this novel and capture it in writing. The author, trying to picture the realities of life in Lebanon, follows the footsteps of realists. The novel displays two panoramas: a historical documentation of Lebanon and a poetic description of the characters\u2019 struggles.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDuring Tamima\u2019s journey at university, she gets caught up in student demonstrations, gets seduced by a rebellious writer, Ramzi Raad, and falls in love with a Christian, Maronite Hani Raai, who lived in Deir Mutil in northern Lebanon. Like most other students, she also had a part-time job to meet her financial needs. The bulk of the novel revolves around her ruthless brother, Jaber Nassour, her growing friendship with Mary Abu-Khalil, and her love for Hani. The climax of the novel was when Hani rejected Tamima after he found out about her past. After several setbacks, Tamima gains wisdom and realizes that her freedom is nothing without the freedom of others. Thus, she decides to join forces with the revolution and change. She then joins the Fedayeen, determined to see though the lies and deceit, and as a result, gradually begins to lose her innocence. Death in Beirut ends with having her career ended, in hopes of fighting for a bigger purpose, ending her intellectual growth.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe novel is written in the third person omniscient point of view, allowing Awwad to explore the conflicts faced in Beirut and the fates of characters in which their fortunes are linked to Tamima\u2019s life. However, the audience is also exposed to Tamima\u2019s inner thoughts as there are moments in the novel of Tamima\u2019s diary. The author does not use an authorial voice to deliver his message, instead, he accomplishes it through human relationships. When analyzing the language of the novel, Awwad uses intense poetic imagery, especially when describing the scene of Tamima getting seductued by Hani, as compared to other Arabic novels. Death in Beirut successfully explores the relationship of people with different religious backgrounds in a distressed community and describes the tragic historical events following the war of 1967 in Lebanon.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Miscellaneous works ===\n\n* Play: The Tourist and The Guide\n\nIn the play, The Tourist and the Guide, the author introduces it by stating that he wants the actors to portray Gods living among mankind, and even on a level greater \"than the gods of Baalbek.\u201d By doing so, the play would be greater than the usual play. The play is not realistic, except in the way the dialogue is fashioned. It belongs to the genre of intellectual drama, where Awwad is acknowledged as the pioneer. Due to his use of intellectual dialogue, the author is determined that the actors be on the level of Gods. In contrast to Ancient Greek, where mankind and the Gods lived in harmony and interact with each other, the author is eager to find philosophical problems faced by mankind in which may cause the Gods distress. The characters of the Tourist and the Guide include the tourist, who came from the other side of the world to visit the ruins of Baalbek, the sculptor, and a man who symbolized the people of the future. The script, unlike normal scripts that are divided into acts, is divided into three sections: arrival, visit and return. As for the acting content of the play, it is not packed with action, rather the intellectual dialogue is what masks the play. The dialogue, although full of discussion of ideas, is dramatized by bursts of imagery and poetry. This play, different from his fiction novels, shows maturity in his thoughts, language, and through his use of imagery.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Political Views and Influences ==\n\n=== Influences on Writing: ===\nTawfiq \u2018Awwad\u2019s childhood was heavily influenced by the stories read to him by his grandmother in the children\u2019s book \u201calf Layla wa Layla.\u201d \u00a0His inspiration later came from French novelists as well as Arab writers and poets such as [[Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani|Ab\u016b al-Faraj al-I\u1e63bah\u0101n\u012b]] (\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0641\u0647\u0627\u0646\u064a), [[Al-Mutanabbi|Al- Mutanabi]] and [[Al-Jahiz|Al- Jahiz]]. His creativeness was not only shaped by stories and other writers, but also his diplomatic life and travels which gave a new type of enrichment to his works.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Tawfiq 'Awwad as a Storyteller ====\nTawfiq \u2018Awwad was a storyteller who wrote both short and long stories which reflected his own life-story, personal experiences, memories, and attitudes that he has expressed and experienced throughout his entire life.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn \u201cal Raghif,\u201d he spoke about poverty that stroke during World War I due to the \u201cal Jarad\u201d invasion of Mount Lebanon in 1916. Tawfiq also dealt with and wrote about other issues including the struggle that the Lebanese people faced before their independence from the [[History of Lebanon under Ottoman rule|Ottoman]] occupation. One of those struggles included the hangings of many revolutionists. From these events that Tawfiq witnessed, he was able to perfectly capture and depict the poverty, misery, and struggle that came while fighting for independence, as well as the ignorance that came on the government\u2019s behalf. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Tawfiq \u2018Awwad as a Journalist and Critic: ====\nHe established his own journal and named it \u201cal Jadid.\u201d Tawfiq had his own unique way of dealing with social issues concerning the public, always taking on an objective perception by taking into consideration all points of view regarding the issue. His ultimate aim was an attempt to eliminate racism and create national parties that involved peace. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==References==\n<references group=\"\" responsive=\"1\"></references>{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Awwad, Tawfiq Yusuf}}\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:1988 deaths]]\n[[Category:Lebanese journalists]]\n[[Category:Lebanese male short story writers]]\n[[Category:Lebanese short story writers]]\n[[Category:Lebanese novelists]]\n[[Category:Lebanese diplomats]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of Lebanon to Italy]]\n[[Category:People from Matn District]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Heading ends with a colon", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawfiq_Yusuf_%27Awwad"}

The ranges for ferritin can vary between laboratories but typical ranges would be between 30\u2013300&nbsp;ng/mL (=\u03bcg/L) for males, and 18\u2013160&nbsp;ng/mL (=\u03bcg/L) for females.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Normal ferritin blood levels according to sex and age<ref name=WebMD>{{cite web|title=Ferritin|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/ferritin#2|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n| '''Men''' || 18\u2013270 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL)\n|-\n| '''Women''' || 18\u2013160&nbsp;ng/mL\n|-\n| '''Children''' (6 months to 15 years) || 7\u2013140&nbsp;ng/mL\n|-\n| '''Infants''' (1 to 5 months) || 50\u2013200&nbsp;ng/mL\n|-\n| '''Neonates''' || 25\u2013200&nbsp;ng/mL\n|}\n\n=== Deficiency ===\n\nIf the ferritin level is low, there is a risk for lack of iron, which could lead to [[anemia]].\n\nIn the setting of anemia, low serum ferritin is the most [[specificity (tests)|specific]] lab test for [[iron-deficiency anemia]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guyatt GH, Patterson C, Ali M, Singer J, Levine M, Turpie I, Meyer R | title = Diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia in the elderly | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 88 | issue = 3 | pages = 205\u20139 | date = March 1990 | pmid = 2178409 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(90)90143-2 }}</ref> However it is less [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitive]], since its levels are increased in the blood by infection or any type of chronic inflammation,<ref name=Firkin1997>{{cite journal | url = http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/20/3/74/6 | title = Interpretation of biochemical tests for iron deficiency: diagnostic difficulties related to limitations of individual tests | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120325192442/http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/20/3/74/6/ | archive-date=2012-03-25 | first1 = Frank | last1 = Firkin | first2 = Bryan | last2 = Rush | name-list-format = vanc | journal = Aust Prescr | date = 1997 | volume = 20 | pages = 74\u20136 }}</ref> and these conditions may convert what would otherwise be a low level of ferritin from lack of iron, into a value in the normal range.

[[Adult-onset Still's disease]], some [[porphyrias]], and [[hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis]]/[[macrophage activation syndrome]] are diseases in which the ferritin level may be abnormally raised.\n\nAs ferritin is also an [[acute phase proteins|acute-phase reactant]], it is often elevated in the course of [[disease]]. A normal [[C-reactive protein]] can be used to exclude elevated ferritin caused by acute phase reactions. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nFerritin has been shown to be elevated in some cases of [[Covid-19]] and may correlate with worse clinical outcome. <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen G, Wu D, Guo W, Cao Y, Huang D, Wang H, Wang T, Zhang X, Chen H, Yu H, Zhang X, Zhang M, Wu S, Song J, Chen T, Han M, Li S, Luo X, Zhao J, Ning Q | display-authors = 6 | title = Clinical and immunological features of severe and moderate coronavirus disease 2019 | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | date = April 2020 | pmid = 32217835 | doi = 10.1172/JCI137244 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to a study of [[anorexia nervosa]] patients, ferritin can be elevated during periods of acute [[malnutrition|malnourishment]], perhaps due to iron going into storage as intravascular volume and thus the number of red blood cells falls.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kennedy A, Kohn M, Lammi A, Clarke S | title = Iron status and haematological changes in adolescent female inpatients with anorexia nervosa | journal = Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health | volume = 40 | issue = 8 | pages = 430\u20132 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15265182 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1754.2004.00432.x }}</ref>\n\nAnother study suggests that due to the catabolic nature of [[anorexia nervosa]], isoferritins may be released.

The title refers to the Brazilian city of [[Rio de Janeiro]],<ref name=\"Variety\" /> where the film is set. The film features the voices of [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Leslie Mann]], [[Rodrigo Santoro]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[George Lopez]], [[Tracy Morgan]] and [[Jamie Foxx]]. It tells the story of Blu (Eisenberg), a domesticated male [[Spix's macaw]] who is taken to Rio de Janeiro to mate with a free-spirited male Spix's macaw, Roberto(Hathaway). The two eventually fall in love, and together they have to escape from being smuggled by Nigel (Clement), a [[cockatoo]]. The theme song, \"Telling the World,\" was performed by [[Taio Cruz]].\n\nSaldanha developed his first story concept of ''Rio'' in 1995, in which a penguin is washed up in Rio. Saldanha learned of the production of the films ''[[Happy Feet]]'' (2006) and ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'' (2007), and changed the concept to involve macaws and their environments in Rio. He proposed his idea to [[Chris Wedge]] in 2006, and the project was set up at [[Blue Sky Studios|Blue Sky]]. The main voice actors were approached in 2009. During production, the crew visited Rio de Janeiro and also consulted with an expert on macaws at the [[Bronx Zoo]] to study their movements.\n\n''Rio'' premiered on March 22, 2011 in [[Lagoa, Rio de Janeiro]], followed by its general release on April 15, 2011 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received moderately positive reviews from film critics, who praised the visuals, voice acting and music. The film was also a box office success, grossing over $143 million in the United States and $484 million worldwide. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for the song \"Real in Rio\", but lost to the other nominee, \"[[Man or Muppet]]\" from ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nominees for the 84th Academy Awards |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html |work=Oscars.org |accessdate=February 1, 2012 |date=January 24, 2012}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Rio 2]]'', was released on April 11, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTICE: PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE KEPT BETWEEN 400-700 WORDS. -->\nIn [[Brazil]], various exotic birds are smuggled out of the country. In [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], a crate with a male [[Spix's macaw]] hatchling falls out of a truck and is found by a little girl named Linda Gunderson, who names him Blu. Over the next 15 years,<ref name=\"TeleRhap\" /> Linda comes to own a bookstore. Highly tame and unable to fly because he is scared to, Blu is ridiculed frequently by the [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] that come by outside of Linda's bookstore.\n\nOne day, [[ornithology|ornithologist]] T\u00falio Monteiro invites Blu and Linda to [[Rio de Janeiro]] because Blu, who is the last known male of his species, needs to mate with the last known male macaw. Linda initially refuses, but later accepts and they fly to Rio. At T\u00falio's [[aviary]], Blu meets Roberto, a fiercely independent [[Spix's macaw]] male longing to flee back to the wilderness. The macaws are captured by Fernando, an orphaned boy, and a [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] named Nigel, both of whom work for a group of smugglers led by Marcel, who wants to leave the country as soon as possible to secure a black market deal regarding Blu and Roberto.\n\nWhile Fernando has second thoughts about his actions, Nigel tells the macaws that he desires to exact revenge on \"pretty birds\" after his role on a television show had been replaced by a parakeet. However, because of Blu's familiarity with cages, they flee into the jungle. Fernando meets Linda and T\u00falio and helps them find the birds, while Blu and Roberto meet Rafael, a [[toco toucan]], who offers to take them to his [[bulldog]] friend, Luiz, to remove their leg chain.\n\nHe attempts to teach Blu how to fly, before they meet up with a [[red-crested cardinal]] named Pedro and his [[yellow canary]] friend Nico. Meanwhile, Nigel coerces a horde of thieving [[marmoset]]s led by Mauro to capture Blu and Roberto. Pedro and Nico then take the macaws to a Rio-style dance party, where they dance together and begin to fall in love, but encounter the marmosets in the process. The birds fight them off while the five escape on a [[tram]].\n\nFernando takes Linda and T\u00falio to the smugglers' hideout, where they discover the birds have already been moved out. Marcel explains that he will use the [[Rio Carnival]] parade to smuggle the birds to the airport, as the other streets have been blocked off for the festivities. Meanwhile, Blu and the others meet Luiz, who releases the chain holding Blu and Roberto. After the two get into a heated argument, they decide to go their separate ways.\n\nPedro and Nico then witness Nigel capturing Roberto. When Blu and Rafael learn of it, they rush to the carnival to rescue her. Meanwhile, Linda and T\u00falio have spotted the smugglers' parade float and organize a rescue attempt for the birds. As Linda and T\u00falio pose as dancers in [[Spix's macaw]] costumes, Nigel captures Blu and the group. Linda and T\u00falio are unable to stop the smugglers in time and Marcel's group takes off in a [[Short SC.7 Skyvan]].\n\nDuring the flight, Blu breaks out his cage using a fire extinguisher and releases the other captive birds. However, Nigel attacks the macaws, injuring Roberto's wing in the process. Blu sends Nigel flying into the plane's engine using the fire extinguisher, causing the plane to fall. The smugglers flee the plane. Unable to fly, Roberto falls out of the plane's open cargo hatch towards the ocean. Jumping out of the plane to rescue her, Blu finally discovers that he is able to fly as he and Roberto kiss, and he carries him to Linda and T\u00falio for help.\n\nLater, they adopt Fernando and live in the jungle to help protect the jungle from smugglers. Blu and Robero eventually raise three chicks named Mario, Luigi, and Toad together, and celebrate with Rafael, Nico, Pedro, Linda, Luiz, and T\u00falio. Meanwhile, Nigel survives the plane crash but is ridiculed for his loss of feathers by Mauro, and the smugglers are sent to prison.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Tyler Blu Gunderson, AKA: Blu, a male [[Spix's macaw]]<ref>{{cite news |title=The Real \"Rio\": True Story of a Spix's Macaw |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/15/1065030/-The-Real-Rio-True-Story-of-a-Spix-s-Macaw |accessdate=May 20, 2012 |newspaper=Daily Kos |date=February 15, 2012}}</ref> who was born in Rio de Janeiro but raised in [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], after he was smuggled.\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Jewel, a female Spix's macaw from The Amazon Jungle, but was taken into Rio de Janeiro.\n* [[Will.i.am]] as Pedro, a [[red-crested cardinal]] who is Nico's best friend.\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Nico, a [[yellow canary]] who loves to [[samba]], and whose bottlecap hat functions as a tambourine.\n* [[George Lopez]] as Rafael, a romantic [[toco toucan]] fond of Carnival.\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Luiz, a [[bulldog]] who is Rafael's friend and a [[chainsaw]] expert who has a medical condition of drooling.\n* [[Jemaine Clement]] as Nigel, a sadistic [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] who used to be a TV star, but was replaced by a Parakeet, causing him to have a  strong hatred for \"pretty birds.\"\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Dr. T\u00falio Monteiro, a Brazilian ornithologist.

The title refers to the Brazilian city of [[Rio de Janeiro]],<ref name=\"Variety\" /> where the film is set. The film features the voices of [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Leslie Mann]], [[Rodrigo Santoro]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[George Lopez]], [[Tracy Morgan]] and [[Jamie Foxx]]. It tells the story of Blu (Eisenberg), a domesticated male [[Spix's macaw]] who is taken to Rio de Janeiro to mate with a free-spirited female Spix's macaw, Jewel (Hathaway). The two eventually fall in love, and together they have to escape from being smuggled by Nigel (Clement), a [[cockatoo]]. The theme song, \"Telling the World,\" was performed by [[Taio Cruz]].\n\nSaldanha developed his first story concept of ''Rio'' in 1995, in which a penguin is washed up in Rio. Saldanha learned of the production of the films ''[[Happy Feet]]'' (2006) and ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'' (2007), and changed the concept to involve macaws and their environments in Rio. He proposed his idea to [[Chris Wedge]] in 2006, and the project was set up at [[Blue Sky Studios|Blue Sky]]. The main voice actors were approached in 2009. During production, the crew visited Rio de Janeiro and also consulted with an expert on macaws at the [[Bronx Zoo]] to study their movements.\n\n''Rio'' premiered on March 22, 2011 in [[Lagoa, Rio de Janeiro]], followed by its general release on April 15, 2011 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received moderately positive reviews from film critics, who praised the visuals, voice acting and music. The film was also a box office success, grossing over $143 million in the United States and $484 million worldwide. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for the song \"Real in Rio\", but lost to the other nominee, \"[[Man or Muppet]]\" from ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nominees for the 84th Academy Awards |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html |work=Oscars.org |accessdate=February 1, 2012 |date=January 24, 2012}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Rio 2]]'', was released on April 11, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTICE: PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE KEPT BETWEEN 400-700 WORDS. -->\nIn [[Brazil]], various exotic birds are smuggled out of the country. In [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], a crate with a male [[Spix's macaw]] hatchling falls out of a truck and is found by a little girl named Linda Gunderson, who names him Blu. Over the next 15 years,<ref name=\"TeleRhap\" /> Linda comes to own a bookstore. Highly tame and unable to fly because he is scared to, Blu is ridiculed frequently by the [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] that come by outside of Linda's bookstore.\n\nOne day, [[ornithology|ornithologist]] T\u00falio Monteiro invites Blu and Linda to [[Rio de Janeiro]] because Blu, who is the last known male of his species, needs to mate with the last known male macaw. Linda initially refuses, but later accepts and they fly to Rio. At T\u00falio's [[aviary]], Blu meets Roberto, a fiercely independent [[Spix's macaw]] male longing to flee back to the wilderness. The macaws are captured by Fernando, an orphaned boy, and a [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] named Nigel, both of whom work for a group of smugglers led by Marcel, who wants to leave the country as soon as possible to secure a black market deal regarding Blu and Roberto.\n\nWhile Fernando has second thoughts about his actions, Nigel tells the macaws that he desires to exact revenge on \"pretty birds\" after his role on a television show had been replaced by a parakeet. However, because of Blu's familiarity with cages, they flee into the jungle. Fernando meets Linda and T\u00falio and helps them find the birds, while Blu and Roberto meet Rafael, a [[toco toucan]], who offers to take them to his [[bulldog]] friend, Luiz, to remove their leg chain.\n\nHe attempts to teach Blu how to fly, before they meet up with a [[red-crested cardinal]] named Pedro and his [[yellow canary]] friend Nico. Meanwhile, Nigel coerces a horde of thieving [[marmoset]]s led by Mauro to capture Blu and Roberto. Pedro and Nico then take the macaws to a Rio-style dance party, where they dance together and begin to fall in love, but encounter the marmosets in the process. The birds fight them off while the five escape on a [[tram]].\n\nFernando takes Linda and T\u00falio to the smugglers' hideout, where they discover the birds have already been moved out. Marcel explains that he will use the [[Rio Carnival]] parade to smuggle the birds to the airport, as the other streets have been blocked off for the festivities. Meanwhile, Blu and the others meet Luiz, who releases the chain holding Blu and Roberto. After the two get into a heated argument, they decide to go their separate ways.\n\nPedro and Nico then witness Nigel capturing Roberto. When Blu and Rafael learn of it, they rush to the carnival to rescue her. Meanwhile, Linda and T\u00falio have spotted the smugglers' parade float and organize a rescue attempt for the birds. As Linda and T\u00falio pose as dancers in [[Spix's macaw]] costumes, Nigel captures Blu and the group. Linda and T\u00falio are unable to stop the smugglers in time and Marcel's group takes off in a [[Short SC.7 Skyvan]].\n\nDuring the flight, Blu breaks out his cage using a fire extinguisher and releases the other captive birds. However, Nigel attacks the macaws, injuring Roberto's wing in the process. Blu sends Nigel flying into the plane's engine using the fire extinguisher, causing the plane to fall. The smugglers flee the plane. Unable to fly, Roberto falls out of the plane's open cargo hatch towards the ocean. Jumping out of the plane to rescue her, Blu finally discovers that he is able to fly as he and Roberto kiss, and he carries him to Linda and T\u00falio for help.\n\nLater, they adopt Fernando and live in the jungle to help protect the jungle from smugglers. Blu and Robero eventually raise three chicks named Mario, Luigi, and Toad together, and celebrate with Rafael, Nico, Pedro, Linda, Luiz, and T\u00falio. Meanwhile, Nigel survives the plane crash but is ridiculed for his loss of feathers by Mauro, and the smugglers are sent to prison.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Tyler Blu Gunderson, AKA: Blu, a male [[Spix's macaw]]<ref>{{cite news |title=The Real \"Rio\": True Story of a Spix's Macaw |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/15/1065030/-The-Real-Rio-True-Story-of-a-Spix-s-Macaw |accessdate=May 20, 2012 |newspaper=Daily Kos |date=February 15, 2012}}</ref> who was born in Rio de Janeiro but raised in [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], after he was smuggled.\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Jewel, a female Spix's macaw from The Amazon Jungle, but was taken into Rio de Janeiro.\n* [[Will.i.am]] as Pedro, a [[red-crested cardinal]] who is Nico's best friend.\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Nico, a [[yellow canary]] who loves to [[samba]], and whose bottlecap hat functions as a tambourine.\n* [[George Lopez]] as Rafael, a romantic [[toco toucan]] fond of Carnival.\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Luiz, a [[bulldog]] who is Rafael's friend and a [[chainsaw]] expert who has a medical condition of drooling.\n* [[Jemaine Clement]] as Nigel, a sadistic [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] who used to be a TV star, but was replaced by a Parakeet, causing him to have a  strong hatred for \"pretty birds.\"\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Dr. T\u00falio Monteiro, a Brazilian ornithologist.
