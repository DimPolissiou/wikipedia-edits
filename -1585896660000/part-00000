The program was established by Congress in 1991 to preserve and protect the nation's scenic but often less-traveled roads and promote [[tourism]] and economic development. The National Scenic Byways Program (NSBP) is administered by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA).\n\nThe most scenic byways are designated '''All-American Roads''', which must meet two out of the six intrinsic qualities. The designation means they have features that do not exist elsewhere in the United States and are unique and important enough to be tourist destinations unto themselves. As of November 2010, there are 120&nbsp;National Scenic Byways and 31&nbsp;All-American Roads, located in 46&nbsp;states (all except [[Hawaii]], [[Nebraska]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Texas]]).<ref>{{cite web |author = Federal Highway Administration |url = http://byways.org/press/listbyways.html |title = List of America's Byways |work = America's Byways |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |accessdate = November 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe NSBP was established under the [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] of 1991, which provided $74.3&nbsp;million in discretionary grants. On May&nbsp;18, 1995, FHWA specified the intrinsic qualities that would serve as criteria for designating road as National Scenic Byways or All-American Roads. In September U.S. Transportation Secretary [[Federico Pe\u00f1a]] announced the first 14&nbsp;National Scenic Byways and six All-American Roads. On June&nbsp;9, 1998, the [[Transportation Equity Act for the 21st&nbsp;Century]] (TEA-21) provided $148&nbsp;million to states so they could develop state roads to take advantage of the program.\n\nOn August&nbsp;10, 2005, President [[George W. Bush]] signed the [[Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users]] (SAFETEA-LU), which provided $175&nbsp;million to states and Indian tribes. Most recently, on October&nbsp;16, 2009, U.S. Transportation Secretary [[Ray LaHood]] designated 37&nbsp;new roads as National Scenic Byways and five new All-American Roads.<ref>{{cite web |author = National Scenic Byways Program |title = History of the Program |url = http://www.bywaysonline.org/program/history.html |work = Program Information |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |accessdate = August 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Requirements==\nNational Scenic Byways go through a nomination procedure. They must already be designated state scenic byways to be nominated (However, roads that meet all criteria for national designation but not state designation may be considered for national designation on a case-by-case basis).<ref name=policy>{{cite journal |first = Rodney E. |last = Slater |url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1995-05-18/html/95-12211.htm |title = National Scenic Byways Program Interim Policy |journal = [[Federal Register]] |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] |volume = 60 |issue = 96 |pages = 26759\u201362 |date = May 18, 1995 |accessdate = May 12, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Intrinsic qualities===\nFor designation as a National Scenic Byway a road must have one of six intrinsic qualities. To be designated an All-American Road, a road must have at least two of the six qualities.<ref name=policy/>\n\n*'''Scenic quality''' is the heightened visual experience derived from the view of natural and manmade elements of the visual environment of the scenic byway corridor. The characteristics of the landscape are strikingly distinct and offer a pleasing and most memorable visual experience.\n*'''Natural quality''' applies to those features in the visual environment that are in a relatively undisturbed state. These features predate the arrival of human populations and may include geological formations, [[fossil]]s, landform, water bodies, vegetation, and wildlife. There may be evidence of human activity, but the natural features reveal minimal disturbances.\n*'''Historic quality''' encompasses legacies of the past that are distinctly associated with physical elements of the landscape, whether natural or manmade, that are of such historic significance that they educate the viewer and stir an appreciation for the past. The historic elements reflect the actions of people and may include buildings, settlement patterns, and other examples of human activity.\n*'''Cultural quality''' is evidence and expressions of the customs or traditions of a distinct group of people. Cultural features include, but are not limited to, crafts, music, dance, rituals, festivals, speech, food, special events, or [[vernacular architecture]].\n*'''Archeological quality''' involves those characteristics of the scenic byways corridor that are physical evidence of historic or prehistoric human life or activity. The scenic byway corridor's archeological interest, as identified through ruins, artifacts, structural remains, and other physical evidence have scientific significance that educate the viewer and stir an appreciation for the past.\n*'''Recreational quality''' involves outdoor recreational activities directly associated with and dependent upon the natural and cultural elements of the corridor's landscape. The recreational activities provide opportunities for active and passive recreational experiences. They include, but are not limited to, downhill skiing, rafting, boating, fishing, and hiking. Driving the road itself may qualify as a pleasurable recreational experience. The recreational activities may be seasonal, but the quality and importance of the recreational activities as seasonal operations must be well recognized.\n\n===Corridor management plans===\nA corridor management plan must also be developed, with community involvement, and the plan \"should provide for the conservation and enhancement of the byway's intrinsic qualities as well as the promotion of tourism and economic development\". The plan includes, but is not limited to:\n\n*A map identifying the corridor boundaries and the location of intrinsic qualities and different land uses within the corridor.\n*A strategy for maintaining and enhancing those intrinsic qualities.\n*A strategy describing how existing development might be enhanced and new development might be accommodated while still preserving the intrinsic qualities of the corridor.\n*A general review of the road's or highway's safety and accident record to identify any correctable faults in highway design, maintenance, or operations.\n*A signage plan that demonstrates how the State will insure and make the number and placement of signs more supportive of the visitor experience.\n*A narrative describing how the National Scenic Byway will be positioned for marketing.<ref name=policy/>\n\nCorridor management plans for All-American Roads must also include:<ref name=policy/>\n\n*A narrative on how the All-American Road would be promoted, interpreted, and marketed in order to attract travelers, especially those from other countries.\n*A plan to encourage the accommodation of increased tourism, if this is projected. Some demonstration that the roadway, lodging and dining facilities, roadside rest areas, and other tourist necessities will be adequate for the number of visitors induced by the byway's designation as an All-American Road.\n*A plan for addressing multi-lingual information needs.\n\nThe final step is when the highway (or highways) is approved for designation by the [[United States Secretary of Transportation]].<ref name=policy/>\n\n==List of byways==\n{{inc-transport|date=February 2017}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders hlist\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Type\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (mi)\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (km)\n!scope=\"col\" | State(s)\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Southern or western terminus\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Northern or eastern terminus\n!scope=\"col\" | Date designated\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{abbr|Ref(s)|References}}\n|-\n| bgcolor=e7e7ff align=center | NSB\n!

The program was established by Congress in 1991 to preserve and protect the nation's scenic but often less-traveled roads and promote [[tourism]] and economic development. The National Scenic Byways Program (NSBP) is administered by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA).\n\nThe most scenic byways are designated '''All-American Roads''', which must meet two out of the six intrinsic qualities. The designation means they have features that do not exist elsewhere in the United States and are unique and important enough to be tourist destinations unto themselves. As of November 2010, there are 120&nbsp;National Scenic Byways and 31&nbsp;All-American Roads, located in 46&nbsp;states (all except [[Hawaii]], [[Nebraska]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Texas]]).<ref>{{cite web |author = Federal Highway Administration |url = http://byways.org/press/listbyways.html |title = List of America's Byways |work = America's Byways |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |accessdate = November 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe NSBP was established under the [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] of 1991, which provided $74.3&nbsp;million in discretionary grants. On May&nbsp;18, 1995, FHWA specified the intrinsic qualities that would serve as criteria for designating road as National Scenic Byways or All-American Roads. In September U.S. Transportation Secretary [[Federico Pe\u00f1a]] announced the first 14&nbsp;National Scenic Byways and six All-American Roads. On June&nbsp;9, 1998, the [[Transportation Equity Act for the 21st&nbsp;Century]] (TEA-21) provided $148&nbsp;million to states so they could develop state roads to take advantage of the program.\n\nOn August&nbsp;10, 2005, President [[George W. Bush]] signed the [[Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users]] (SAFETEA-LU), which provided $175&nbsp;million to states and Indian tribes. Most recently, on October&nbsp;16, 2009, U.S. Transportation Secretary [[Ray LaHood]] designated 37&nbsp;new roads as National Scenic Byways and five new All-American Roads.<ref>{{cite web |author = National Scenic Byways Program |title = History of the Program |url = http://www.bywaysonline.org/program/history.html |work = Program Information |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |accessdate = August 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Requirements==\nNational Scenic Byways go through a nomination procedure. They must already be designated state scenic byways to be nominated (However, roads that meet all criteria for national designation but not state designation may be considered for national designation on a case-by-case basis).<ref name=policy>{{cite journal |first = Rodney E. |last = Slater |url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1995-05-18/html/95-12211.htm |title = National Scenic Byways Program Interim Policy |journal = [[Federal Register]] |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] |volume = 60 |issue = 96 |pages = 26759\u201362 |date = May 18, 1995 |accessdate = May 12, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Intrinsic qualities===\nFor designation as a National Scenic Byway a road must have one of six intrinsic qualities. To be designated an All-American Road, a road must have at least two of the six qualities.<ref name=policy/>\n\n*'''Scenic quality''' is the heightened visual experience derived from the view of natural and manmade elements of the visual environment of the scenic byway corridor. The characteristics of the landscape are strikingly distinct and offer a pleasing and most memorable visual experience.\n*'''Natural quality''' applies to those features in the visual environment that are in a relatively undisturbed state. These features predate the arrival of human populations and may include geological formations, [[fossil]]s, landform, water bodies, vegetation, and wildlife. There may be evidence of human activity, but the natural features reveal minimal disturbances.\n*'''Historic quality''' encompasses legacies of the past that are distinctly associated with physical elements of the landscape, whether natural or manmade, that are of such historic significance that they educate the viewer and stir an appreciation for the past. The historic elements reflect the actions of people and may include buildings, settlement patterns, and other examples of human activity.\n*'''Cultural quality''' is evidence and expressions of the customs or traditions of a distinct group of people. Cultural features include, but are not limited to, crafts, music, dance, rituals, festivals, speech, food, special events, or [[vernacular architecture]].\n*'''Archeological quality''' involves those characteristics of the scenic byways corridor that are physical evidence of historic or prehistoric human life or activity. The scenic byway corridor's archeological interest, as identified through ruins, artifacts, structural remains, and other physical evidence have scientific significance that educate the viewer and stir an appreciation for the past.\n*'''Recreational quality''' involves outdoor recreational activities directly associated with and dependent upon the natural and cultural elements of the corridor's landscape. The recreational activities provide opportunities for active and passive recreational experiences. They include, but are not limited to, downhill skiing, rafting, boating, fishing, and hiking. Driving the road itself may qualify as a pleasurable recreational experience. The recreational activities may be seasonal, but the quality and importance of the recreational activities as seasonal operations must be well recognized.\n\n===Corridor management plans===\nA corridor management plan must also be developed, with community involvement, and the plan \"should provide for the conservation and enhancement of the byway's intrinsic qualities as well as the promotion of tourism and economic development\". The plan includes, but is not limited to:\n\n*A map identifying the corridor boundaries and the location of intrinsic qualities and different land uses within the corridor.\n*A strategy for maintaining and enhancing those intrinsic qualities.\n*A strategy describing how existing development might be enhanced and new development might be accommodated while still preserving the intrinsic qualities of the corridor.\n*A general review of the road's or highway's safety and accident record to identify any correctable faults in highway design, maintenance, or operations.\n*A signage plan that demonstrates how the State will insure and make the number and placement of signs more supportive of the visitor experience.\n*A narrative describing how the National Scenic Byway will be positioned for marketing.<ref name=policy/>\n\nCorridor management plans for All-American Roads must also include:<ref name=policy/>\n\n*A narrative on how the All-American Road would be promoted, interpreted, and marketed in order to attract travelers, especially those from other countries.\n*A plan to encourage the accommodation of increased tourism, if this is projected. Some demonstration that the roadway, lodging and dining facilities, roadside rest areas, and other tourist necessities will be adequate for the number of visitors induced by the byway's designation as an All-American Road.\n*A plan for addressing multi-lingual information needs.\n\nThe final step is when the highway (or highways) is approved for designation by the [[United States Secretary of Transportation]].<ref name=policy/>\n\n==List of byways==\n{{inc-transport|date=February 2017}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders hlist\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Type\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (mi)\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (km)\n!scope=\"col\" | State(s)\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Southern or western terminus\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Northern or eastern terminus\n!scope=\"col\" | Date designated\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{abbr|Ref(s)|References}}\n|-\n| bgcolor=e7e7ff align=center | NSB\n!

While H\u00f6ss was away on an official journey in late August 1941 his deputy, [[Karl Fritzsch]], tested out an idea. At Auschwitz clothes infested with lice were treated with crystallised prussic acid. The crystals were made to order by the [[IG Farben]] chemicals company for which the brand name was Zyklon-B. Once released from their container, Zyklon-B crystals in the air released a lethal cyanide gas. Fritzsch tried out the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on Soviet POWs, who were locked up in cells in the basement of the bunker for this experiment. H\u00f6ss on his return was briefed and impressed with the results and this became the camp strategy for extermination as it was also to be at Majdanek.

They accompanied them into the gas chambers outfitted to appear as shower rooms (with nonworking water nozzles, and tile walls); and remained with the victims until just before the chamber door closed. To psychologically maintain the \"calming effect\" of the delousing deception, an SS man stood at the door until the end. The ''Sonderkommando'' talked to the victims about life in the camp to pacify the suspicious ones, and hurried them inside; to that effect, they also assisted the aged and the very young in undressing.<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 321\u2013322.</ref>\n\nTo further persuade the prisoners that nothing harmful was happening, the ''Sonderkommando'' deceived them with small talk about friends or relations who had arrived in earlier transports. Many young mothers hid their infants beneath their piled clothes fearing that the delousing \"disinfectant\" might harm them. Camp Commandant H\u00f6ss reported that the \"men of the Special Detachment were particularly on the look-out for this\", and encouraged the women to take their children into the \"shower room\".

These involved instruments such as mallets and agricultural knives which were often used in a manner where victims were thrown off the end of a ramp into the Sava River while they were still alive .\n\nThe estimates for the [[Jadovno concentration camp]] generally offer a range of 10,000 \u2013 72,000 deaths at the camp over a period of 122 days (May to August 1941).<ref name=\"USHMM-J\">[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ US Holocaust Memorial Museum: Jasenovac] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030802193350/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ |date=2 August 2003 }}</ref> Most commonly Jadovno victims were bound together in a line and the first few victims were murdered with rifle butts or other objects.

While H\u00f6ss was away on an official journey in late August 1941 his deputy, [[Karl Fritzsch]], tested out an idea. At Auschwitz clothes infested with lice were treated with crystallised prussic acid. The crystals were made to order by the [[IG Farben]] chemicals company for which the brand name was Zyklon-B. Once released from their container, Zyklon-B crystals in the air released a lethal cyanide gas. Fritzsch tried out the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on Soviet POWs, who were locked up in cells in the basement of the bunker for this experiment. H\u00f6ss on his return was briefed and impressed with the results and this became the camp strategy for extermination as it was also to be at Majdanek.

They accompanied them into the gas chambers outfitted to appear as shower rooms (with nonworking water nozzles, and tile walls); and remained with the victims until just before the chamber door closed. To psychologically maintain the \"calming effect\" of the delousing deception, an SS man stood at the door until the end. The ''Sonderkommando'' talked to the victims about life in the camp to pacify the suspicious ones, and hurried them inside; to that effect, they also assisted the aged and the very young in undressing.<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 321\u2013322.</ref>\n\nTo further persuade the prisoners that nothing harmful was happening, the ''Sonderkommando'' deceived them with small talk about friends or relations who had arrived in earlier transports. Many young mothers hid their infants beneath their piled clothes fearing that the delousing \"disinfectant\" might harm them. Camp Commandant H\u00f6ss reported that the \"men of the Special Detachment were particularly on the look-out for this\", and encouraged the women to take their children into the \"shower room\".

A notable difference with the Usta\u0161e camps as compared to the German ''SS'' camps was the widespread use of manual methods in the mass killings. These involved instruments such as mallets and agricultural knives which were often used in a manner where victims were thrown off the end of a ramp into the Sava River while they were still alive .\n\nThe estimates for the [[Jadovno concentration camp]] generally offer a range of 10,000 \u2013 72,000 deaths at the camp over a period of 122 days (May to August 1941).<ref name=\"USHMM-J\">[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ US Holocaust Memorial Museum: Jasenovac] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030802193350/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ |date=2 August 2003 }}</ref> Most commonly Jadovno victims were bound together in a line and the first few victims were murdered with rifle butts or other objects.

In exchange for each deposit of precious metal, the goldsmiths issued [[receipt]]s certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a [[bailee]]; these receipts could not be assigned, only the original depositor could collect the stored goods.\n\nGradually the goldsmiths began to lend the money out on behalf of the [[deposit (finance)|depositor]], and [[promissory note]]s (which evolved into banknotes) were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith.<ref>Thus by the 19th century we find \u201c[i]n ordinary cases of deposits of money with banking corporations, or bankers, the transaction amounts to a mere loan or mutuum, and the bank is to restore, not the same money, but an equivalent sum, whenever it is demanded.\u201d Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Law of Bailments (1832, p. 66) and \u201cMoney, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal (see Parker v. Marchant, 1 Phillips 360); it is then the money of the banker, who is bound to return an equivalent by paying a similar sum to that deposited with him when he is asked for it.\u201d [[Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham|Lord Chancellor Cottenham]], ''[[Foley v Hill]]'' (1848) 2 HLC 28.</ref> The goldsmith paid interest on these deposits. Since the promissory notes were payable on demand, and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of [[fractional reserve banking]]. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay,<ref>Richards. The usual denomination was 50 or 100 pounds, so these notes were not an everyday currency for the common people</ref> allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of [[default (finance)|default]].<ref>Richards, p. 40</ref> Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit.\n\nThe [[Bank of England]] was the first to begin the permanent issue of [[banknote]]s, in 1695.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishnotes.co.uk/news_and_info/features/|title=A History of British Banknotes|work=britishnotes.co.uk}}</ref> The [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] established the first [[overdraft]] facility in 1728.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eccount.com/financial-news/a-short-history-of-overdrafts/#.UneWvFMqvp0 |title=A short history of overdrafts |publisher=eccount money |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105155745/http://www.eccount.com/financial-news/a-short-history-of-overdrafts/ |archivedate=2013-11-05 }}</ref> By the beginning of the 19th century a [[bankers' clearing house]] was established in London to allow multiple banks to clear transactions.

See the relevant country pages for more information.\n\nUnder [[English common law]], a banker is defined as a person who carries on the business of banking by conducting [[Current account (banking)|current accounts]] for his customers, paying [[cheques]] drawn on him/her and also collecting [[cheques]] for his/her customers.<ref>[[United Dominions Trust Ltd v Kirkwood]], 1966, English Court of Appeal, 2 QB 431</ref>\n[[File:Banco de Venezuela, Coro.JPG|thumb|[[Banco de Venezuela]] in [[Coro, Venezuela|Coro]].]]\n[[File:Bank.Pokhara.JPG|thumb|Branch of [[Nepal Bank Limited|Nepal Bank]] in Pokhara, Western Nepal.]]\n\nIn most common law jurisdictions there is a Bills of Exchange Act that codifies the law in relation to [[negotiable instruments]], including [[cheques]], and this Act contains a statutory definition of the term ''banker'': ''banker'' includes a body of persons, whether incorporated or not, who carry on the business of banking' (Section 2, Interpretation). Although this definition seems circular, it is actually functional, because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is structured or regulated.\n\nThe business of banking is in many common law countries not defined by statute but by common law, the definition above. In other English common law jurisdictions there are statutory definitions of the ''business of banking'' or ''banking business''. When looking at these definitions it is important to keep in mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the legislation, and not necessarily in general. In particular, most of the definitions are from legislation that has the purpose of regulating and supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking. However, in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law one. Examples of statutory definitions:\n* \"banking business\" means the business of receiving money on current or deposit account, paying and collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers, the making of advances to customers, and includes such other business as the Authority may prescribe for the purposes of this Act; (Banking Act ([[Singapore]]), Section 2, Interpretation).\n* \"banking business\" means the business of either or both of the following:\n# receiving from the general public money on current, deposit, savings or other similar account repayable on demand or within less than [3 months] ... or with a period of call or notice of less than that period;\n# paying or collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers.<ref>(Banking Ordinance, Section 2, Interpretation, Hong Kong) Note that in this case the definition is extended to include accepting any deposits repayable in less than 3 months, companies that accept deposits of greater than HK$100 000 for periods of greater than 3 months are regulated as [[List of banks in Hong Kong|deposit taking companies]] rather than as banks in Hong Kong.</ref>\n\nSince the advent of [[EFTPOS]] (Electronic Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale), direct credit, [[direct debit]] and [[online banking|internet banking]], the cheque has lost its primacy in most banking systems as a payment instrument. This has led legal theorists to suggest that the cheque based definition should be broadened to include financial institutions that conduct current accounts for customers and enable customers to pay and be paid by third parties, even if they do not pay and collect cheques .<ref>e.g. Tyree's Banking Law in New Zealand, A L Tyree, LexisNexis 2003, p. 70.</ref>\n\n===Standard business===\n[[File:WinonaSavingsBankVault.JPG|thumb|Large door to an old [[bank vault]].]]\nBanks act as payment agents by conducting [[Transactional account|checking or current accounts]] for customers, paying [[cheque]]s drawn by customers in the bank, and collecting cheques deposited to customers' current accounts. Banks also enable customer payments via other payment methods such as [[Automated Clearing House]] (ACH), [[Wire transfer]]s or [[telegraphic transfer]], [[EFTPOS]], and [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs).\n\nBanks borrow money by accepting funds deposited on current accounts, by accepting [[term deposit]]s, and by issuing debt securities such as [[banknotes]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]. Banks lend money by making advances to customers on current accounts, by making [[installment loan]]s, and by investing in marketable debt securities and other forms of money lending.\n\nBanks provide different payment services, and a bank account is considered indispensable by most businesses and individuals. Non-banks that provide payment services such as remittance companies are normally not considered as an adequate substitute for a bank account.\n\nBanks can create new money when they make a loan. New loans throughout the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system. The money supply is usually increased by the act of lending, and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated. In the [[United Kingdom]] between 1997 and 2007, there was an increase in the money supply, largely caused by much more bank lending, which served to push up property prices and increase private debt. The amount of money in the economy as measured by M4 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] went from \u00a3750 billion to \u00a31700 billion between 1997 and 2007, much of the increase caused by bank lending.<ref>Bank of England statistics and the book \"Where does money come from?\", p. 47, by the New Economics Foundation.</ref> If all the banks increase their lending together, then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase. Excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default, the banks then become more cautious, so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and many other Western economies after 2007.\n[[File:NatWest banking van at Berkeley, Glos, England 2Aug2018 arp.jpg|thumb|left|A NatWest mobile banking van in the town of [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], Gloucestershire, England. The van visits Berkeley for two hours each Thursday following the closure of the town's NatWest branch in 2015.]]\n\n===Range of activities===\nActivities undertaken by banks include [[retail banking|personal banking]], [[commercial bank|corporate banking]], [[investment banking]], [[private banking]], [[transaction banking]], [[insurance]], [[loan|consumer finance]], [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange trading]], [[commodity market|commodity trading]], [[stock market|trading in equities]], [[futures exchange|futures and options trading]] and [[money market|money market trading]].\n\n===Channels===\n[[File:SunTrust Bank, Gaithersburg, Maryland, August 25, 2015.jpg|thumb|An American bank in Maryland.]]\nBanks offer many different channels to access their banking and other services:\n* [[Branch (banking)|Branch, in-person banking]] in a retail location\n* [[Automated teller machine|Automated teller machine banking]] adjacent to or remote from the bank\n* Bank by mail: Most banks accept cheque deposits via mail and use mail to communicate to their customers\n* [[Online banking]] over the Internet to perform multiple types of transactions\n* [[Mobile banking]] is using one's mobile phone to conduct banking transactions\n* [[Telephone banking]] allows customers to conduct transactions over the telephone with an [[automated attendant]], or when requested, with a [[switchboard operator|telephone operator]]\n* [[Video banking]] performs banking transactions or professional banking consultations via a remote video and audio connection. Video banking can be performed via purpose built banking transaction machines (similar to an Automated teller machine) or via a [[video conference]] enabled bank branch clarification\n* [[Customer relationship management|Relationship manager]], mostly for private banking or business banking, who visits customers at their homes or businesses\n* [[Direct Selling Association|Direct Selling Agent]], who works for the bank based on a contract, whose main job is to increase the customer base for the bank\n\n===Business models===\nA bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest, transaction fees and financial advice. Traditionally, the most significant method is via charging [[interest]] on the capital it lends out to customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gobankingrates.com/banking/banks/how-banks-make-money/|title=How Do Banks Make Money?}}</ref> The bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds, and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities.\n\nThis difference is referred to as the [[Net interest spread|spread]] between the cost of funds and the loan interest rate. Historically, profitability from lending activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and the stage of the [[economic cycle]]. Fees and financial advice constitute a more stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these revenue lines to smooth their financial performance.\n\nIn the past 20 years, American banks have taken many measures to ensure that they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market conditions.\n* First, this includes the [[Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act]], which allows banks again to merge with investment and insurance houses. Merging banking, investment, and insurance functions allows traditional banks to respond to increasing consumer demands for \"one-stop shopping\" by enabling [[cross-selling]] of products (which, the banks hope, will also increase profitability).\n* Second, they have expanded the use of [[risk-based pricing]] from business lending to consumer lending, which means charging higher interest rates to those customers that are considered to be a higher credit risk and thus increased chance of [[default (finance)|default]] on loans. This helps to offset the losses from bad loans, lowers the price of loans to those who have better credit histories, and offers credit products to high risk customers who would otherwise be denied credit.\n* Third, they have sought to increase the methods of payment processing available to the general public and business clients. These products include [[debit card]]s, prepaid cards, [[smart card]]s, and [[credit card]]s. They make it easier for consumers to conveniently make transactions and [[consumption smoothing|smooth their consumption]] over time (in some countries with underdeveloped financial systems, it is still common to deal strictly in cash, including carrying suitcases filled with cash to purchase a home).\n\n:However, with the convenience of easy credit, there is also increased risk that consumers will mismanage their financial resources and accumulate excessive debt. Banks make money from card products through interest charges and fees charged to cardholders, and [[transaction fee]]s to retailers who accept the bank's credit and/or debit cards for payments.\nThis helps in making a profit and facilitates economic development as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10385783/how-banks-make-money.html|title= How Banks Make Money|publisher= The Street|accessdate=2011-09-08}}</ref>\n\nRecently, as banks have been faced with pressure from fintechs, new and additional business models have been suggested such as freemium, monetization of data, white-labeling of banking and payment applications, or the cross-selling of complementary products.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Blockchain Babel: The Crypto-craze and the Challenge to Business|last=Pejic|first=Igor|date=2019-03-28|publisher=Kogan Page|isbn=9780749484163|edition= 1st|language=English}}</ref>\n\n===Products===\n[[File:Halifax bank, Commercial Street, Leeds (27th May 2010).jpg|thumb|right|A former [[building society]], now a modern retail bank in [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]].]]\n[[File:NatWest Castle Street.jpg|thumb|right| An interior of a branch of [[National Westminster Bank]] on Castle Street, [[Liverpool]]]]\n\n====Retail====\n* [[Savings account]]\n* [[Recurring deposit|Recurring deposit account]]\n* [[Fixed deposit|Fixed deposit account]]\n* [[Money market account]]\n* [[Certificate of deposit]] (CD)\n* [[Individual retirement account]] (IRA)\n* [[Credit card]]\n* [[Debit card]]\n* [[Mortgage]]\n* [[Mutual fund]]\n* [[Personal loan]]\n* [[Time deposits]]\n* [[ATM card]]\n* [[Transactional account#Current accounts|Current accounts]]\n* [[Cheque|Cheque books]]\n* [[Automated Teller Machine]] (ATM)\n* [[National Electronic Fund Transfer]] (NEFT)\n* [[Real Time Gross Settlement]] (RTGS)\n\n====Business (or commercial/investment) banking====\n* [[Loan|Business loan]]\n* [[Stock exchange#Raising capital for businesses|Capital raising]] ([[Equity (finance)|equity]] / [[debt]] / [[Hybrid security|hybrids]])\n* [[Revolving credit]]\n* [[Risk management]] ([[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] (FX)), [[interest rate]]s, [[Commodity|commodities]], [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]]\n* [[Term loan]]\n* Cash management services (lock box, remote deposit capture, merchant processing)\n* [[Credit (finance)|Credit services]]\n\n==Capital and risk==\nBanks face a number of [[financial risk|risks]] in order to conduct their business, and how well these risks are managed and understood is a key driver behind profitability, and how much [[Capital requirement|capital]] a bank is required to hold.

Then debt is reduced and bank capitalization gets a boost. Owing to their capacity to absorb losses, CoCos have the potential to satisfy regulatory capital requirement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://econwpa.repec.org/eps/fin/papers/0408/0408003.pdf |title=Bank Stability and Market Discipline: Debt-for-Equity Swap versus Subordinated Notes |last=Raviv |first=Alon |date=13 August 2014 |access-date=13 July 2018 |work=[[EconPapers]] |publisher=The Hebrew University Business School |pages=59}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bear.warrington.ufl.edu/flannery/No%20Pain,%20No%20Gain.pdf |title=No Pain, No Gain?

These claims on banks can act as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand, and hence valued at par. They are effectively transferable by mere delivery, in the case of banknotes, or by drawing a cheque that the payee may bank or cash.\n# Netting and settlement of payments \u2013 banks act as both collection and paying agents for customers, participating in interbank clearing and settlement systems to collect, present, be presented with, and pay payment instruments. This enables banks to economize on reserves held for settlement of payments, since inward and outward payments offset each other. It also enables the offsetting of payment flows between geographical areas, reducing the cost of settlement between them.\n# Credit intermediation \u2013 banks borrow and lend back-to-back on their own account as middle men.\n# Credit quality improvement \u2013 banks lend money to ordinary commercial and personal borrowers (ordinary credit quality), but are high quality borrowers. The improvement comes from diversification of the bank's assets and capital which provides a buffer to absorb losses without defaulting on its obligations. However, banknotes and deposits are generally unsecured; if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets as security, to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate, this puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated position.\n# [[Asset liability mismatch]]/[[Maturity transformation]] \u2013 banks borrow more on demand debt and short term debt, but provide more long term loans. In other words, they borrow short and lend long. With a stronger credit quality than most other borrowers, banks can do this by aggregating issues (e.g. accepting deposits and issuing banknotes) and redemptions (e.g. withdrawals and redemption of banknotes), maintaining reserves of cash, investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed, and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources (e.g. wholesale cash markets and securities markets).\n# [[Money creation]]/destruction \u2013 whenever a bank gives out a loan in a [[fractional-reserve banking]] system, a new sum of money is created and conversely, whenever the principal on that loan is repaid money is destroyed.\n\n==Bank crisis==\n[[File:Bosakov dom.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|OTP Bank in [[Pre\u0161ov]] (Slovakia)]]\nBanks are susceptible to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chiararustici/2018/07/24/personal-data-and-the-next-subprime-crisis/#4748d43370aa|title=Personal Data And The Next Subprime Crisis}}</ref> These include [[liquidity risk]] (where many depositors may request withdrawals in excess of available funds), [[credit risk]] (the chance that those who owe money to the bank will not repay it), and [[interest rate risk]] (the possibility that the bank will become unprofitable, if rising interest rates force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans).\n\nBanking crises have developed many times throughout history when one or more risks have emerged for a banking sector as a whole. Prominent examples include the [[bank run]] that occurred during the [[Great Depression]], the U.S. [[Savings and Loan crisis]] in the 1980s and early 1990s, the [[Japan]]ese banking crisis during the 1990s, and the [[sub-prime mortgage crisis]] in the 2000s.\n\n===Size of global banking industry===\nAssets of the largest 1,000 banks in the world grew by 6.8% in the 2008/2009 financial year to a record US$96.4&nbsp;trillion while profits declined by 85% to US$115&nbsp;billion. Growth in assets in adverse market conditions was largely a result of recapitalization. EU banks held the largest share of the total, 56% in 2008/2009, down from 61% in the previous year. Asian banks' share increased from 12% to 14% during the year, while the share of US banks increased from 11% to 13%.

In the UK, for example, the [[Financial Services Authority]] licenses banks, and some commercial banks (such as the [[Bank of Scotland]]) issue their own banknotes in addition to those issued by the [[Bank of England]], the UK government's central bank.\n\n[[File:Basel - Bottabau am Aeschenplatz1.jpg|thumb|Global headquarters of the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in [[Basel]]]]\n\nBanking law is based on a contractual analysis of the relationship between the ''bank'' (defined above) and the ''customer''&nbsp;\u2013 defined as any entity for which the bank agrees to conduct an account.\n\nThe law implies rights and obligations into this relationship as follows:\n* The bank account balance is the financial position between the bank and the customer: when the account is in credit, the bank owes the balance to the customer; when the account is overdrawn, the customer owes the balance to the bank.\n* The bank agrees to pay the customer's checks up to the amount standing to the credit of the customer's account, plus any agreed overdraft limit.\n* The bank may not pay from the customer's account without a mandate from the customer, e.g. a cheque drawn by the customer.\n* The bank agrees to promptly collect the cheques deposited to the customer's account as the customer's agent, and to credit the proceeds to the customer's account.\n* The bank has a right to combine the customer's accounts, since each account is just an aspect of the same credit relationship.\n* The bank has a [[lien]] on cheques deposited to the customer's account, to the extent that the customer is indebted to the bank.\n* The bank must not disclose details of transactions through the customer's account&nbsp;\u2013 unless the customer consents, there is a public duty to disclose, the bank's interests require it, or the law demands it.\n* The bank must not close a customer's account without reasonable notice, since cheques are outstanding in the ordinary course of business for several days.\n\nThese implied contractual terms may be modified by express agreement between the customer and the bank. The statutes and regulations in force within a particular jurisdiction may also modify the above terms and/or create new rights, obligations or limitations relevant to the bank-customer relationship.\n\nSome types of financial institution, such as [[Building Society|building societies]] and [[credit unions]], may be partly or wholly exempt from bank license requirements, and therefore regulated under separate rules.\n\nThe requirements for the issue of a bank license vary between jurisdictions but typically include:\n* Minimum capital\n* Minimum capital ratio\n* 'Fit and Proper' requirements for the bank's controllers, owners, directors, or senior officers\n* Approval of the bank's business plan as being sufficiently prudent and plausible.\n\n==Types of banking==\nBanks' activities can be divided into:\n* [[retail banking]], dealing directly with individuals and small businesses;\n* [[business banking]], providing services to mid-market business;\n* [[corporate banking]], directed at large business entities;\n* [[private banking]], providing wealth management services to [[high-net-worth individual]]s and families;\n* [[investment banking]], relating to activities on the [[financial markets]].\nMost banks are profit-making, private enterprises. However, some are owned by government, or are [[non-profit organization]]s.\n\n===Types of bank===\n[[File:NatBankRep.jpg|thumb|National Bank of the Republic, [[Salt Lake City]] 1908]]\n[[File:ATM AL RAJHI BANK.JPG|thumb|[[Automated teller machine|ATM]] [[Al-Rajhi Bank]]]]\n[[File:NatCuBank.jpg|thumb|National Copper Bank, [[Salt Lake City]] 1911]]\n[[File:Gitam administrative block.jpg|thumb|A branch of [[Union Bank of India|Union Bank]] in, [[Visakhapatnam]]]]\n* [[Commercial bank]]s: the term used for a normal bank to distinguish it from an investment bank. After the [[Great Depression]], the U.S. Congress required that banks only engage in banking activities, whereas investment banks were limited to [[capital market]] activities. Since the two no longer have to be under separate ownership, some use the term \"commercial bank\" to refer to a bank or a division of a bank that mostly deals with deposits and loans from corporations or large businesses.\n* [[Community banks]]: locally operated financial institutions that empower employees to make local decisions to serve their customers and the partners.\n* [[Community development bank]]s: regulated banks that provide financial services and credit to under-served markets or populations.\n* [[Land development bank]]s: The special banks providing long-term loans are called [[land development bank]]s (LDB). The history of LDB is quite old. The first LDB was started at Jhang in [[Punjab]] in 1920. The main objective of the LDBs are to promote the development of land, agriculture and increase the agricultural production. The LDBs provide long-term finance to members  directly through their branches.<ref name=\"agritech\">{{cite web | url=http://agritech.tnau.ac.in/banking/crbank_land_dvpt_bank.html | title=Land Development Bank | publisher=TNAU Agritech Portal | accessdate=8 January 2014 | author=TNAU}}</ref>\n* [[Credit union]]s or [[Cooperative banking|co-operative banks]]: not-for-profit [[cooperatives]] owned by the depositors and often offering rates more favourable than for-profit banks. Typically, membership is restricted to employees of a particular company, residents of a defined area, members of a certain [[labor union|union]] or religious organizations, and their immediate families.\n* [[Postal savings system|Postal savings banks]]: savings banks associated with national postal systems.\n* [[Private banking|Private banks]]: banks that manage the assets of high-net-worth individuals. Historically a minimum of US$1 million was required to open an account, however, over the last years many private banks have lowered their entry hurdles to US$350,000 for private investors.<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Commercial Banks in Nepal |url=https://www.subedibimal.com.np/2019/05/interest-rates-of-different-banks-in-nepal.html |accessdate=6 June 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Offshore bank]]s: banks located in jurisdictions with low taxation and regulation. Many offshore banks are essentially private banks.\n* [[Savings bank]]: in Europe, savings banks took their roots in the 19th or sometimes even in the 18th century. Their original objective was to provide easily accessible savings products to all strata of the population. In some countries, savings banks were created on public initiative; in others, socially committed individuals created foundations to put in place the necessary infrastructure. Nowadays, European savings banks have kept their focus on retail banking: payments, savings products, credits and insurances for individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises. Apart from this retail focus, they also differ from commercial banks by their broadly decentralized distribution network, providing local and regional outreach&nbsp;\u2013 and by their socially responsible approach to business and society.\n* [[Building societies]] and [[Landesbank]]s: institutions that conduct retail banking.\n* [[Ethical bank]]s: banks that prioritize the transparency of all operations and make only what they consider to be socially responsible investments.\n* A [[Direct bank|direct or internet-only bank]] is a banking operation without any physical bank branches. Transactions are usually accomplished using [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] and [[Electronic funds transfer|electronic transfers]] and [[direct deposit]]s through an online interface.\n\n===Types of investment banks===\n* [[Investment bank]]s \"[[underwrite]]\" (guarantee the sale of) stock and bond issues, trade for their own accounts, make markets, provide [[investment management]], and advise corporations on [[capital market]] activities such as mergers and acquisitions.\n* [[Merchant bank]]s were traditionally banks which engaged in [[trade finance]]. The modern definition, however, refers to banks which provide capital to firms in the form of shares rather than loans. Unlike [[venture cap]]s, they tend not to invest in new companies.\n\n===Combination banks===\n[[File:BDO Bank in SM Aura, BGC.jpg|thumb|A [[Branch (banking)|branch]] of [[Banco de Oro]] in [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]]]\n[[File:Avenida Sao Joao, Sao Paulo 2006.jpg|thumb|A [[Banco do Brasil]] office in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]], the bank is the largest financial institution in Brazil and [[Latin America]].]]\n\n* [[Universal bank]]s, more commonly known as [[financial services]] companies, engage in several of these activities. These big banks are very diversified groups that, among other services, also distribute insurance&nbsp;\u2013  hence the term [[bancassurance]], a [[portmanteau|portmanteau word]] combining \"banque or bank\" and \"assurance\", signifying that both banking and insurance are provided by the same corporate entity.\n\n===Other types of banks===\n* [[Central bank]]s are normally government-owned and charged with quasi-regulatory responsibilities, such as supervising commercial banks, or controlling the cash [[interest rate]]. They generally provide liquidity to the banking system and act as the [[lender of last resort]] in event of a crisis.\n* [[Islamic bank]]s adhere to the concepts of [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. This form of banking revolves around several well-established principles based on Islamic canons. All banking activities must avoid interest, a concept that is forbidden in Islam. Instead, the bank earns profit ([[Markup (business)|markup]]) and fees on the financing facilities that it extends to customers.\n\n==Challenges within the banking industry==\n{{Globalize|section|date=September 2009}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2008}}\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Banking in the United States}}\n[[File:People's Trust Company Building 183 Montague Street Brooklyn.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|right|[[Citibank]], The People's Trust Company Building, [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].]]\n\nThe United States banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated and guarded in the world,<ref>Scott Besley and Eugene F. Brigham, ''Principles of Finance'', 4th ed. (Mason, OH: South-Western Cengage Learning, 2009), 125.  This popular university textbook explains: \"Generally speaking, U.S. financial institutions have been much more heavily regulated and faced greater limitations ... than have their foreign counterparts.\"</ref> with multiple specialized and focused regulators. All banks with FDIC-insured deposits have the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) as a regulator. However, for soundness examinations (i.e., whether a bank is operating in a sound manner), the [[Federal Reserve]] is the primary federal regulator for Fed-member state banks; the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC) is the primary federal regulator for national banks. State non-member banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the FDIC. National banks have one primary regulator&nbsp;\u2013 the OCC.\n\nEach regulatory agency has their own set of rules and regulations to which banks and thrifts must adhere.\nThe [[Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council]] (FFIEC) was established in 1979 as a formal inter-agency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions. Although the FFIEC has resulted in a greater degree of regulatory consistency between the agencies, the rules and regulations are constantly changing.\n\nIn addition to changing regulations, changes in the industry have led to consolidations within the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OTS, and OCC. Offices have been closed, supervisory regions have been merged, staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut. The remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator. While banks struggle to keep up with the changes in the regulatory environment, regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks. The impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less hands-on assessment by the regulators, less time spent with each institution, and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks, potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the United States.\n\nThe changing economic environment has a significant impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans, rate competition for deposits and the general market changes, industry trends and economic fluctuations. It has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market. A rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions, but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders.\n\nThe management of the banks\u2019 asset portfolios also remains a challenge in today's economic environment. Loans are a bank's primary asset category and when loan quality becomes suspect, the foundation of a bank is shaken to the core. While always an issue for banks, declining [[asset quality]] has become a big problem for financial institutions.\n[[File:Mirror building (4004925857).jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|[[Safra National Bank]], New York]]\nThere are several reasons for this, one of which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of \u201cgood times.\u201d The potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management. Problems are more likely to go undetected, resulting in a significant impact on the bank when they are discovered. In addition, banks, like any business, struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses, such as adequate employee training programs.\n\nBanks also face a host of other challenges such as ageing ownership groups. Across the country, many banks\u2019 management teams and board of directors are ageing. Banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders, both public and private, to achieve earnings and growth projections. Regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk. Banking is also an extremely competitive industry. Competing in the financial services industry has become tougher with the entrance of such players as insurance agencies, credit unions, cheque cashing services, credit card companies, etc.\n\nAs a reaction, banks have developed their activities in [[financial instruments]], through [[financial market]] operations such as [[brokerage firm|brokerage]] and have become big players in such activities.\n\nAnother major challenge is the ageing infrastructure, also called legacy IT. Backend systems were built decades ago and are incompatible to new applications. Fixing bugs and creating interfaces costs huge sums, as knowledgeable programmers become scarce.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-cobol/banks-scramble-to-fix-old-systems-as-it-cowboys-ride-into-sunset-idUSKBN17C0D8|title=Banks scramble to fix old systems as IT 'cowboys' ride into sunset|last=Irrera|first=Anna|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Loan activities of banks===\nTo be able to provide home buyers and builders with the funds needed, banks must compete for deposits. The phenomenon of [[disintermediation]] had to dollars moving from savings accounts and into direct market instruments such as [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of Treasury]] obligations, agency securities, and corporate debt. One of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the tremendous growth of money market funds whose higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits.<ref name=\"multiple3\">{{cite book |author1=Mishler, Lon |author2=Cole, Robert E. |title=Consumer and business credit management |publisher=Irwin |location=Homewood |year=1995 |pages=128\u201329 |isbn=978-0-256-13948-8 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>\n\nTo compete for deposits, US savings institutions offer many different types of plans:<ref name=\"multiple3\"/>\n* [[Passbook]] or ordinary [[deposit account]]s &nbsp;\u2013  permit any amount to be added to or withdrawn from the account at any time.\n* NOW and Super NOW accounts &nbsp;\u2013  function like checking accounts but earn interest. A minimum balance may be required on Super NOW accounts.\n* [[Money market account]]s &nbsp;\u2013  carry a monthly limit of preauthorized transfers to other accounts or persons and may require a minimum or average balance.\n* Certificate accounts &nbsp;\u2013  subject to loss of some or all interest on withdrawals before maturity.\n* Notice accounts &nbsp;\u2013  the equivalent of certificate accounts with an indefinite term. Savers agree to notify the institution a specified time before withdrawal.\n* [[Individual retirement account]]s (IRAs) and [[Keogh plan]]s &nbsp;\u2013  a form of retirement savings in which the funds deposited and interest earned are exempt from income tax until after withdrawal.\n* [[Checking account]]s &nbsp;\u2013  offered by some institutions under definite restrictions.\n* All withdrawals and deposits are completely the sole decision and responsibility of the account owner unless the parent or guardian is required to do otherwise for legal reasons.\n* Club accounts and other [[savings account]]s &nbsp;\u2013  designed to help people save regularly to meet certain goals.\n\n== Types of accounts ==\n[[File:BBTLexington.jpg|thumb|Suburban bank branch]]\n[[Bank statement]]s are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting standards of the world. Under [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] there are two kinds of accounts: debit and credit. Credit accounts are Revenue, Equity and Liabilities. Debit Accounts are Assets and Expenses. The bank credits a ''credit account'' to increase its balance, and debits a ''credit account'' to decrease its balance.<ref>{{cite book | title= Monetary and Financial Statistics: Compilation Guide | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=a03zkw-5fcEC | author= Statistics Department | year= 2001 | page= 24 | chapter= Source Data for Monetary and Financial Statistics | chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=a03zkw-5fcEC&pg=PT36 | publisher= [[International Monetary Fund]] | location= [[Washington D.C.]] | isbn= 978-1-58906-584-0 | accessdate= 2009-03-14}}</ref>\n\nThe customer debits his or her savings/bank (asset) account in his ledger when making a deposit (and the account is normally in debit), while the customer credits a credit card (liability) account in his ledger every time he spends money (and the account is normally in credit). When the customer reads his bank statement, the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits, and debits for withdrawals of funds. The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement. If the customer is overdrawn, he will have a negative balance, reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement.\n\n===Brokered deposits===\nOne source of deposits for banks is brokers who deposit large sums of money on behalf of investors through trust corporations. This money will generally go to the banks which offer the most favourable terms, often better than those offered local depositors. It is possible for a bank to engage in business with no local deposits at all, all funds being brokered deposits. Accepting a significant quantity of such deposits, or \"[[hot money]]\" as it is sometimes called, puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position, as the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to pay the high interest being paid on the brokered deposits. This may result in risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank. Banks which failed during 2008 and 2009 in the United States during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|global financial crisis]] had, on average, four times more brokered deposits as a percent of their deposits than the average bank. Such deposits, combined with risky real estate investments, factored into the [[savings and loan crisis]] of the 1980s. Regulation of brokered deposits is opposed by banks on the grounds that the practice can be a source of external funding to growing communities with insufficient local deposits.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/04/business/04brokered.html |title=For Banks, Wads of Cash and Loads of Trouble |first=Eric |last=Lipton |author-link=Eric Lipton |first2=Andrew |last2=Martin |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 July 2009 |access-date=13 July 2018 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |location=Macon, Ga}}</ref> There are different types of accounts: saving, recurring and current accounts.\n\n===Custodial accounts===\nCustodial accounts are accounts in which assets are held for a third party. For example, businesses that accept custody of funds for clients prior to their conversion, return or transfer may have a custodial account at a bank for this purposes.\n\n==Globalization in the banking industry==\nIn modern time there has been huge reductions to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry. Increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies, such as Bloomberg, have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world, since they no longer have to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk. The growth in cross-border activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities.\nHowever, despite these reductions in barriers and growth in cross-border activities, the banking industry is nowhere near as globalized as some other industries. In the US, for instance, very few banks even worry about the Riegle\u2013Neal Act, which promotes more efficient interstate banking. In the vast majority of nations around the globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation.\nOne reason the banking industry has not been fully globalized is that it is more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small business and individuals. On the other hand, for large corporations, it is not as important in what nation the bank is in, since the corporation's financial information is available around the globe.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://scholar.google.nl/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=WXWj19cAAAAJ&citation_for_view=WXWj19cAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC |title=To what extent will the banking industry be globalized?

Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are [[Banking regulation|highly regulated]] in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as [[fractional reserve banking]] under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to [[minimum capital requirement]]s based on an international set of capital standards, known as the [[Basel Accords]].\n\nBanking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of [[Renaissance Italy]] but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and [[lending]] that had their roots in the [[ancient world]].

Lenders in [[ancient Greece]] and during the [[Roman Empire]] added two important innovations: they accepted [[Deposit account|deposits]] and [[Bureau de change|changed money]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Archaeology from this period in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] and [[history of India|India]] also shows evidence of money lending.\n\nThe present era of banking can be traced to medieval and early [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]], to the rich cities in the centre and north like [[Florence]], [[Lucca]], [[Siena]], [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]]. The [[Bardi family|Bardi]] and [[Peruzzi]] families dominated banking in 14th-century Florence, establishing branches in many other parts of [[Europe]].<ref>[[Noble Foster Hoggson|Hoggson, N.

Merchants started to store their gold with the [[goldsmith]]s of [[London]], who possessed private [[bank vault|vaults]], and charged a fee for that service. In exchange for each deposit of precious metal, the goldsmiths issued [[receipt]]s certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a [[bailee]]; these receipts could not be assigned, only the original depositor could collect the stored goods.\n\nGradually the goldsmiths began to lend the money out on behalf of the [[deposit (finance)|depositor]], and [[promissory note]]s (which evolved into banknotes) were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith.<ref>Thus by the 19th century we find \u201c[i]n ordinary cases of deposits of money with banking corporations, or bankers, the transaction amounts to a mere loan or mutuum, and the bank is to restore, not the same money, but an equivalent sum, whenever it is demanded.\u201d Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Law of Bailments (1832, p. 66) and \u201cMoney, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal (see Parker v. Marchant, 1 Phillips 360); it is then the money of the banker, who is bound to return an equivalent by paying a similar sum to that deposited with him when he is asked for it.\u201d [[Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham|Lord Chancellor Cottenham]], ''[[Foley v Hill]]'' (1848) 2 HLC 28.</ref> The goldsmith paid interest on these deposits. Since the promissory notes were payable on demand, and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of [[fractional reserve banking]]. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay,<ref>Richards. The usual denomination was 50 or 100 pounds, so these notes were not an everyday currency for the common people</ref> allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of [[default (finance)|default]].<ref>Richards, p. 40</ref> Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit.\n\nThe [[Bank of England]] was the first to begin the permanent issue of [[banknote]]s, in 1695.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishnotes.co.uk/news_and_info/features/|title=A History of British Banknotes|work=britishnotes.co.uk}}</ref> The [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] established the first [[overdraft]] facility in 1728.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eccount.com/financial-news/a-short-history-of-overdrafts/#.UneWvFMqvp0 |title=A short history of overdrafts |publisher=eccount money |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105155745/http://www.eccount.com/financial-news/a-short-history-of-overdrafts/ |archivedate=2013-11-05 }}</ref> By the beginning of the 19th century a [[bankers' clearing house]] was established in London to allow multiple banks to clear transactions.

See the relevant country pages for more information.\n\nUnder [[English common law]], a banker is defined as a person who carries on the business of banking by conducting [[Current account (banking)|current accounts]] for his customers, paying [[cheques]] drawn on him/her and also collecting [[cheques]] for his/her customers.<ref>[[United Dominions Trust Ltd v Kirkwood]], 1966, English Court of Appeal, 2 QB 431</ref>\n[[File:Banco de Venezuela, Coro.JPG|thumb|[[Banco de Venezuela]] in [[Coro, Venezuela|Coro]].]]\n[[File:Bank.Pokhara.JPG|thumb|Branch of [[Nepal Bank Limited|Nepal Bank]] in Pokhara, Western Nepal.]]\n\nIn most common law jurisdictions there is a Bills of Exchange Act that codifies the law in relation to [[negotiable instruments]], including [[cheques]], and this Act contains a statutory definition of the term ''banker'': ''banker'' includes a body of persons, whether incorporated or not, who carry on the business of banking' (Section 2, Interpretation). Although this definition seems circular, it is actually functional, because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is structured or regulated.\n\nThe business of banking is in many common law countries not defined by statute but by common law, the definition above. In other English common law jurisdictions there are statutory definitions of the ''business of banking'' or ''banking business''. When looking at these definitions it is important to keep in mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the legislation, and not necessarily in general. In particular, most of the definitions are from legislation that has the purpose of regulating and supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking. However, in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law one. Examples of statutory definitions:\n* \"banking business\" means the business of receiving money on current or deposit account, paying and collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers, the making of advances to customers, and includes such other business as the Authority may prescribe for the purposes of this Act; (Banking Act ([[Singapore]]), Section 2, Interpretation).\n* \"banking business\" means the business of either or both of the following:\n# receiving from the general public money on current, deposit, savings or other similar account repayable on demand or within less than [3 months] ... or with a period of call or notice of less than that period;\n# paying or collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers.<ref>(Banking Ordinance, Section 2, Interpretation, Hong Kong) Note that in this case the definition is extended to include accepting any deposits repayable in less than 3 months, companies that accept deposits of greater than HK$100 000 for periods of greater than 3 months are regulated as [[List of banks in Hong Kong|deposit taking companies]] rather than as banks in Hong Kong.</ref>\n\nSince the advent of [[EFTPOS]] (Electronic Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale), direct credit, [[direct debit]] and [[online banking|internet banking]], the cheque has lost its primacy in most banking systems as a payment instrument. This has led legal theorists to suggest that the cheque based definition should be broadened to include financial institutions that conduct current accounts for customers and enable customers to pay and be paid by third parties, even if they do not pay and collect cheques .<ref>e.g. Tyree's Banking Law in New Zealand, A L Tyree, LexisNexis 2003, p. 70.</ref>\n\n===Standard business===\n[[File:WinonaSavingsBankVault.JPG|thumb|Large door to an old [[bank vault]].]]\nBanks act as payment agents by conducting [[Transactional account|checking or current accounts]] for customers, paying [[cheque]]s drawn by customers in the bank, and collecting cheques deposited to customers' current accounts. Banks also enable customer payments via other payment methods such as [[Automated Clearing House]] (ACH), [[Wire transfer]]s or [[telegraphic transfer]], [[EFTPOS]], and [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs).\n\nBanks borrow money by accepting funds deposited on current accounts, by accepting [[term deposit]]s, and by issuing debt securities such as [[banknotes]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]. Banks lend money by making advances to customers on current accounts, by making [[installment loan]]s, and by investing in marketable debt securities and other forms of money lending.\n\nBanks provide different payment services, and a bank account is considered indispensable by most businesses and individuals. Non-banks that provide payment services such as remittance companies are normally not considered as an adequate substitute for a bank account.\n\nBanks can create new money when they make a loan. New loans throughout the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system. The money supply is usually increased by the act of lending, and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated. In the [[United Kingdom]] between 1997 and 2007, there was an increase in the money supply, largely caused by much more bank lending, which served to push up property prices and increase private debt. The amount of money in the economy as measured by M4 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] went from \u00a3750 billion to \u00a31700 billion between 1997 and 2007, much of the increase caused by bank lending.<ref>Bank of England statistics and the book \"Where does money come from?\", p. 47, by the New Economics Foundation.</ref> If all the banks increase their lending together, then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase. Excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default, the banks then become more cautious, so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and many other Western economies after 2007.\n[[File:NatWest banking van at Berkeley, Glos, England 2Aug2018 arp.jpg|thumb|left|A NatWest mobile banking van in the town of [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], Gloucestershire, England.

Video banking can be performed via purpose built banking transaction machines (similar to an Automated teller machine) or via a [[video conference]] enabled bank branch clarification\n* [[Customer relationship management|Relationship manager]], mostly for private banking or business banking, who visits customers at their homes or businesses\n* [[Direct Selling Association|Direct Selling Agent]], who works for the bank based on a contract, whose main job is to increase the customer base for the bank\n\n===Business models===\nA bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest, transaction fees and financial advice. Traditionally, the most significant method is via charging [[interest]] on the capital it lends out to customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gobankingrates.com/banking/banks/how-banks-make-money/|title=How Do Banks Make Money?}}</ref> The bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds, and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities.\n\nThis difference is referred to as the [[Net interest spread|spread]] between the cost of funds and the loan interest rate. Historically, profitability from lending activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and the stage of the [[economic cycle]]. Fees and financial advice constitute a more stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these revenue lines to smooth their financial performance.\n\nIn the past 20 years, American banks have taken many measures to ensure that they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market conditions.\n* First, this includes the [[Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act]], which allows banks again to merge with investment and insurance houses. Merging banking, investment, and insurance functions allows traditional banks to respond to increasing consumer demands for \"one-stop shopping\" by enabling [[cross-selling]] of products (which, the banks hope, will also increase profitability).\n* Second, they have expanded the use of [[risk-based pricing]] from business lending to consumer lending, which means charging higher interest rates to those customers that are considered to be a higher credit risk and thus increased chance of [[default (finance)|default]] on loans. This helps to offset the losses from bad loans, lowers the price of loans to those who have better credit histories, and offers credit products to high risk customers who would otherwise be denied credit.\n* Third, they have sought to increase the methods of payment processing available to the general public and business clients. These products include [[debit card]]s, prepaid cards, [[smart card]]s, and [[credit card]]s. They make it easier for consumers to conveniently make transactions and [[consumption smoothing|smooth their consumption]] over time (in some countries with underdeveloped financial systems, it is still common to deal strictly in cash, including carrying suitcases filled with cash to purchase a home).\n\n:However, with the convenience of easy credit, there is also increased risk that consumers will mismanage their financial resources and accumulate excessive debt. Banks make money from card products through interest charges and fees charged to cardholders, and [[transaction fee]]s to retailers who accept the bank's credit and/or debit cards for payments.\nThis helps in making a profit and facilitates economic development as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10385783/how-banks-make-money.html|title= How Banks Make Money|publisher= The Street|accessdate=2011-09-08}}</ref>\n\nRecently, as banks have been faced with pressure from fintechs, new and additional business models have been suggested such as freemium, monetization of data, white-labeling of banking and payment applications, or the cross-selling of complementary products.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Blockchain Babel: The Crypto-craze and the Challenge to Business|last=Pejic|first=Igor|date=2019-03-28|publisher=Kogan Page|isbn=9780749484163|edition= 1st|language=English}}</ref>\n\n===Products===\n[[File:Halifax bank, Commercial Street, Leeds (27th May 2010).jpg|thumb|right|A former [[building society]], now a modern retail bank in [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]].]]\n[[File:NatWest Castle Street.jpg|thumb|right| An interior of a branch of [[National Westminster Bank]] on Castle Street, [[Liverpool]]]]\n\n====Retail====\n* [[Savings account]]\n* [[Recurring deposit|Recurring deposit account]]\n* [[Fixed deposit|Fixed deposit account]]\n* [[Money market account]]\n* [[Certificate of deposit]] (CD)\n* [[Individual retirement account]] (IRA)\n* [[Credit card]]\n* [[Debit card]]\n* [[Mortgage]]\n* [[Mutual fund]]\n* [[Personal loan]]\n* [[Time deposits]]\n* [[ATM card]]\n* [[Transactional account#Current accounts|Current accounts]]\n* [[Cheque|Cheque books]]\n* [[Automated Teller Machine]] (ATM)\n* [[National Electronic Fund Transfer]] (NEFT)\n* [[Real Time Gross Settlement]] (RTGS)\n\n====Business (or commercial/investment) banking====\n* [[Loan|Business loan]]\n* [[Stock exchange#Raising capital for businesses|Capital raising]] ([[Equity (finance)|equity]] / [[debt]] / [[Hybrid security|hybrids]])\n* [[Revolving credit]]\n* [[Risk management]] ([[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] (FX)), [[interest rate]]s, [[Commodity|commodities]], [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]]\n* [[Term loan]]\n* Cash management services (lock box, remote deposit capture, merchant processing)\n* [[Credit (finance)|Credit services]]\n\n==Capital and risk==\nBanks face a number of [[financial risk|risks]] in order to conduct their business, and how well these risks are managed and understood is a key driver behind profitability, and how much [[Capital requirement|capital]] a bank is required to hold.

Then debt is reduced and bank capitalization gets a boost. Owing to their capacity to absorb losses, CoCos have the potential to satisfy regulatory capital requirement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://econwpa.repec.org/eps/fin/papers/0408/0408003.pdf |title=Bank Stability and Market Discipline: Debt-for-Equity Swap versus Subordinated Notes |last=Raviv |first=Alon |date=13 August 2014 |access-date=13 July 2018 |work=[[EconPapers]] |publisher=The Hebrew University Business School |pages=59}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bear.warrington.ufl.edu/flannery/No%20Pain,%20No%20Gain.pdf |title=No Pain, No Gain?

These claims on banks can act as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand, and hence valued at par. They are effectively transferable by mere delivery, in the case of banknotes, or by drawing a cheque that the payee may bank or cash.\n# Netting and settlement of payments \u2013 banks act as both collection and paying agents for customers, participating in interbank clearing and settlement systems to collect, present, be presented with, and pay payment instruments. This enables banks to economize on reserves held for settlement of payments, since inward and outward payments offset each other. It also enables the offsetting of payment flows between geographical areas, reducing the cost of settlement between them.\n# Credit intermediation \u2013 banks borrow and lend back-to-back on their own account as middle men.\n# Credit quality improvement \u2013 banks lend money to ordinary commercial and personal borrowers (ordinary credit quality), but are high quality borrowers. The improvement comes from diversification of the bank's assets and capital which provides a buffer to absorb losses without defaulting on its obligations. However, banknotes and deposits are generally unsecured; if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets as security, to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate, this puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated position.\n# [[Asset liability mismatch]]/[[Maturity transformation]] \u2013 banks borrow more on demand debt and short term debt, but provide more long term loans. In other words, they borrow short and lend long. With a stronger credit quality than most other borrowers, banks can do this by aggregating issues (e.g. accepting deposits and issuing banknotes) and redemptions (e.g. withdrawals and redemption of banknotes), maintaining reserves of cash, investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed, and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources (e.g. wholesale cash markets and securities markets).\n# [[Money creation]]/destruction \u2013 whenever a bank gives out a loan in a [[fractional-reserve banking]] system, a new sum of money is created and conversely, whenever the principal on that loan is repaid money is destroyed.\n\n==Bank crisis==\n[[File:Bosakov dom.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|OTP Bank in [[Pre\u0161ov]] (Slovakia)]]\nBanks are susceptible to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chiararustici/2018/07/24/personal-data-and-the-next-subprime-crisis/#4748d43370aa|title=Personal Data And The Next Subprime Crisis}}</ref> These include [[liquidity risk]] (where many depositors may request withdrawals in excess of available funds), [[credit risk]] (the chance that those who owe money to the bank will not repay it), and [[interest rate risk]] (the possibility that the bank will become unprofitable, if rising interest rates force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans).\n\nBanking crises have developed many times throughout history when one or more risks have emerged for a banking sector as a whole. Prominent examples include the [[bank run]] that occurred during the [[Great Depression]], the U.S. [[Savings and Loan crisis]] in the 1980s and early 1990s, the [[Japan]]ese banking crisis during the 1990s, and the [[sub-prime mortgage crisis]] in the 2000s.\n\n===Size of global banking industry===\nAssets of the largest 1,000 banks in the world grew by 6.8% in the 2008/2009 financial year to a record US$96.4&nbsp;trillion while profits declined by 85% to US$115&nbsp;billion. Growth in assets in adverse market conditions was largely a result of recapitalization. EU banks held the largest share of the total, 56% in 2008/2009, down from 61% in the previous year. Asian banks' share increased from 12% to 14% during the year, while the share of US banks increased from 11% to 13%.

Central banks also typically have a monopoly on the business of issuing [[banknote]]s. However, in some countries this is not the case. In the UK, for example, the [[Financial Services Authority]] licenses banks, and some commercial banks (such as the [[Bank of Scotland]]) issue their own banknotes in addition to those issued by the [[Bank of England]], the UK government's central bank.\n\n[[File:Basel - Bottabau am Aeschenplatz1.jpg|thumb|Global headquarters of the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in [[Basel]]]]\n\nBanking law is based on a contractual analysis of the relationship between the ''bank'' (defined above) and the ''customer''&nbsp;\u2013 defined as any entity for which the bank agrees to conduct an account.\n\nThe law implies rights and obligations into this relationship as follows:\n* The bank account balance is the financial position between the bank and the customer: when the account is in credit, the bank owes the balance to the customer; when the account is overdrawn, the customer owes the balance to the bank.\n* The bank agrees to pay the customer's checks up to the amount standing to the credit of the customer's account, plus any agreed overdraft limit.\n* The bank may not pay from the customer's account without a mandate from the customer, e.g. a cheque drawn by the customer.\n* The bank agrees to promptly collect the cheques deposited to the customer's account as the customer's agent, and to credit the proceeds to the customer's account.\n* The bank has a right to combine the customer's accounts, since each account is just an aspect of the same credit relationship.\n* The bank has a [[lien]] on cheques deposited to the customer's account, to the extent that the customer is indebted to the bank.\n* The bank must not disclose details of transactions through the customer's account&nbsp;\u2013 unless the customer consents, there is a public duty to disclose, the bank's interests require it, or the law demands it.\n* The bank must not close a customer's account without reasonable notice, since cheques are outstanding in the ordinary course of business for several days.\n\nThese implied contractual terms may be modified by express agreement between the customer and the bank. The statutes and regulations in force within a particular jurisdiction may also modify the above terms and/or create new rights, obligations or limitations relevant to the bank-customer relationship.\n\nSome types of financial institution, such as [[Building Society|building societies]] and [[credit unions]], may be partly or wholly exempt from bank license requirements, and therefore regulated under separate rules.\n\nThe requirements for the issue of a bank license vary between jurisdictions but typically include:\n* Minimum capital\n* Minimum capital ratio\n* 'Fit and Proper' requirements for the bank's controllers, owners, directors, or senior officers\n* Approval of the bank's business plan as being sufficiently prudent and plausible.\n\n==Types of banking==\nBanks' activities can be divided into:\n* [[retail banking]], dealing directly with individuals and small businesses;\n* [[business banking]], providing services to mid-market business;\n* [[corporate banking]], directed at large business entities;\n* [[private banking]], providing wealth management services to [[high-net-worth individual]]s and families;\n* [[investment banking]], relating to activities on the [[financial markets]].\nMost banks are profit-making, private enterprises. However, some are owned by government, or are [[non-profit organization]]s.\n\n===Types of bank===\n[[File:NatBankRep.jpg|thumb|National Bank of the Republic, [[Salt Lake City]] 1908]]\n[[File:ATM AL RAJHI BANK.JPG|thumb|[[Automated teller machine|ATM]] [[Al-Rajhi Bank]]]]\n[[File:NatCuBank.jpg|thumb|National Copper Bank, [[Salt Lake City]] 1911]]\n[[File:Gitam administrative block.jpg|thumb|A branch of [[Union Bank of India|Union Bank]] in, [[Visakhapatnam]]]]\n* [[Commercial bank]]s: the term used for a normal bank to distinguish it from an investment bank. After the [[Great Depression]], the U.S. Congress required that banks only engage in banking activities, whereas investment banks were limited to [[capital market]] activities. Since the two no longer have to be under separate ownership, some use the term \"commercial bank\" to refer to a bank or a division of a bank that mostly deals with deposits and loans from corporations or large businesses.\n* [[Community banks]]: locally operated financial institutions that empower employees to make local decisions to serve their customers and the partners.\n* [[Community development bank]]s: regulated banks that provide financial services and credit to under-served markets or populations.\n* [[Land development bank]]s: The special banks providing long-term loans are called [[land development bank]]s (LDB). The history of LDB is quite old. The first LDB was started at Jhang in [[Punjab]] in 1920. The main objective of the LDBs are to promote the development of land, agriculture and increase the agricultural production. The LDBs provide long-term finance to members  directly through their branches.<ref name=\"agritech\">{{cite web | url=http://agritech.tnau.ac.in/banking/crbank_land_dvpt_bank.html | title=Land Development Bank | publisher=TNAU Agritech Portal | accessdate=8 January 2014 | author=TNAU}}</ref>\n* [[Credit union]]s or [[Cooperative banking|co-operative banks]]: not-for-profit [[cooperatives]] owned by the depositors and often offering rates more favourable than for-profit banks. Typically, membership is restricted to employees of a particular company, residents of a defined area, members of a certain [[labor union|union]] or religious organizations, and their immediate families.\n* [[Postal savings system|Postal savings banks]]: savings banks associated with national postal systems.\n* [[Private banking|Private banks]]: banks that manage the assets of high-net-worth individuals. Historically a minimum of US$1 million was required to open an account, however, over the last years many private banks have lowered their entry hurdles to US$350,000 for private investors.<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Commercial Banks in Nepal |url=https://www.subedibimal.com.np/2019/05/interest-rates-of-different-banks-in-nepal.html |accessdate=6 June 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Offshore bank]]s: banks located in jurisdictions with low taxation and regulation. Many offshore banks are essentially private banks.\n* [[Savings bank]]: in Europe, savings banks took their roots in the 19th or sometimes even in the 18th century. Their original objective was to provide easily accessible savings products to all strata of the population. In some countries, savings banks were created on public initiative; in others, socially committed individuals created foundations to put in place the necessary infrastructure. Nowadays, European savings banks have kept their focus on retail banking: payments, savings products, credits and insurances for individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises. Apart from this retail focus, they also differ from commercial banks by their broadly decentralized distribution network, providing local and regional outreach&nbsp;\u2013 and by their socially responsible approach to business and society.\n* [[Building societies]] and [[Landesbank]]s: institutions that conduct retail banking.\n* [[Ethical bank]]s: banks that prioritize the transparency of all operations and make only what they consider to be socially responsible investments.\n* A [[Direct bank|direct or internet-only bank]] is a banking operation without any physical bank branches. Transactions are usually accomplished using [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] and [[Electronic funds transfer|electronic transfers]] and [[direct deposit]]s through an online interface.\n\n===Types of investment banks===\n* [[Investment bank]]s \"[[underwrite]]\" (guarantee the sale of) stock and bond issues, trade for their own accounts, make markets, provide [[investment management]], and advise corporations on [[capital market]] activities such as mergers and acquisitions.\n* [[Merchant bank]]s were traditionally banks which engaged in [[trade finance]]. The modern definition, however, refers to banks which provide capital to firms in the form of shares rather than loans. Unlike [[venture cap]]s, they tend not to invest in new companies.\n\n===Combination banks===\n[[File:BDO Bank in SM Aura, BGC.jpg|thumb|A [[Branch (banking)|branch]] of [[Banco de Oro]] in [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]]]\n[[File:Avenida Sao Joao, Sao Paulo 2006.jpg|thumb|A [[Banco do Brasil]] office in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]], the bank is the largest financial institution in Brazil and [[Latin America]].]]\n\n* [[Universal bank]]s, more commonly known as [[financial services]] companies, engage in several of these activities. These big banks are very diversified groups that, among other services, also distribute insurance&nbsp;\u2013  hence the term [[bancassurance]], a [[portmanteau|portmanteau word]] combining \"banque or bank\" and \"assurance\", signifying that both banking and insurance are provided by the same corporate entity.\n\n===Other types of banks===\n* [[Central bank]]s are normally government-owned and charged with quasi-regulatory responsibilities, such as supervising commercial banks, or controlling the cash [[interest rate]]. They generally provide liquidity to the banking system and act as the [[lender of last resort]] in event of a crisis.\n* [[Islamic bank]]s adhere to the concepts of [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. This form of banking revolves around several well-established principles based on Islamic canons. All banking activities must avoid interest, a concept that is forbidden in Islam. Instead, the bank earns profit ([[Markup (business)|markup]]) and fees on the financing facilities that it extends to customers.\n\n==Challenges within the banking industry==\n{{Globalize|section|date=September 2009}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2008}}\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Banking in the United States}}\n[[File:People's Trust Company Building 183 Montague Street Brooklyn.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|right|[[Citibank]], The People's Trust Company Building, [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].]]\n\nThe United States banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated and guarded in the world,<ref>Scott Besley and Eugene F. Brigham, ''Principles of Finance'', 4th ed. (Mason, OH: South-Western Cengage Learning, 2009), 125.  This popular university textbook explains: \"Generally speaking, U.S. financial institutions have been much more heavily regulated and faced greater limitations ... than have their foreign counterparts.\"</ref> with multiple specialized and focused regulators. All banks with FDIC-insured deposits have the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) as a regulator. However, for soundness examinations (i.e., whether a bank is operating in a sound manner), the [[Federal Reserve]] is the primary federal regulator for Fed-member state banks; the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC) is the primary federal regulator for national banks. State non-member banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the FDIC. National banks have one primary regulator&nbsp;\u2013 the OCC.\n\nEach regulatory agency has their own set of rules and regulations to which banks and thrifts must adhere.\nThe [[Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council]] (FFIEC) was established in 1979 as a formal inter-agency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions. Although the FFIEC has resulted in a greater degree of regulatory consistency between the agencies, the rules and regulations are constantly changing.\n\nIn addition to changing regulations, changes in the industry have led to consolidations within the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OTS, and OCC. Offices have been closed, supervisory regions have been merged, staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut. The remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator. While banks struggle to keep up with the changes in the regulatory environment, regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks. The impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less hands-on assessment by the regulators, less time spent with each institution, and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks, potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the United States.\n\nThe changing economic environment has a significant impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans, rate competition for deposits and the general market changes, industry trends and economic fluctuations. It has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market. A rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions, but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders.\n\nThe management of the banks\u2019 asset portfolios also remains a challenge in today's economic environment. Loans are a bank's primary asset category and when loan quality becomes suspect, the foundation of a bank is shaken to the core. While always an issue for banks, declining [[asset quality]] has become a big problem for financial institutions.\n[[File:Mirror building (4004925857).jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|[[Safra National Bank]], New York]]\nThere are several reasons for this, one of which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of \u201cgood times.\u201d The potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management. Problems are more likely to go undetected, resulting in a significant impact on the bank when they are discovered. In addition, banks, like any business, struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses, such as adequate employee training programs.\n\nBanks also face a host of other challenges such as ageing ownership groups. Across the country, many banks\u2019 management teams and board of directors are ageing. Banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders, both public and private, to achieve earnings and growth projections. Regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk. Banking is also an extremely competitive industry. Competing in the financial services industry has become tougher with the entrance of such players as insurance agencies, credit unions, cheque cashing services, credit card companies, etc.\n\nAs a reaction, banks have developed their activities in [[financial instruments]], through [[financial market]] operations such as [[brokerage firm|brokerage]] and have become big players in such activities.\n\nAnother major challenge is the ageing infrastructure, also called legacy IT. Backend systems were built decades ago and are incompatible to new applications. Fixing bugs and creating interfaces costs huge sums, as knowledgeable programmers become scarce.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-cobol/banks-scramble-to-fix-old-systems-as-it-cowboys-ride-into-sunset-idUSKBN17C0D8|title=Banks scramble to fix old systems as IT 'cowboys' ride into sunset|last=Irrera|first=Anna|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Loan activities of banks===\nTo be able to provide home buyers and builders with the funds needed, banks must compete for deposits. The phenomenon of [[disintermediation]] had to dollars moving from savings accounts and into direct market instruments such as [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of Treasury]] obligations, agency securities, and corporate debt. One of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the tremendous growth of money market funds whose higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits.<ref name=\"multiple3\">{{cite book |author1=Mishler, Lon |author2=Cole, Robert E. |title=Consumer and business credit management |publisher=Irwin |location=Homewood |year=1995 |pages=128\u201329 |isbn=978-0-256-13948-8 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>\n\nTo compete for deposits, US savings institutions offer many different types of plans:<ref name=\"multiple3\"/>\n* [[Passbook]] or ordinary [[deposit account]]s &nbsp;\u2013  permit any amount to be added to or withdrawn from the account at any time.\n* NOW and Super NOW accounts &nbsp;\u2013  function like checking accounts but earn interest. A minimum balance may be required on Super NOW accounts.\n* [[Money market account]]s &nbsp;\u2013  carry a monthly limit of preauthorized transfers to other accounts or persons and may require a minimum or average balance.\n* Certificate accounts &nbsp;\u2013  subject to loss of some or all interest on withdrawals before maturity.\n* Notice accounts &nbsp;\u2013  the equivalent of certificate accounts with an indefinite term. Savers agree to notify the institution a specified time before withdrawal.\n* [[Individual retirement account]]s (IRAs) and [[Keogh plan]]s &nbsp;\u2013  a form of retirement savings in which the funds deposited and interest earned are exempt from income tax until after withdrawal.\n* [[Checking account]]s &nbsp;\u2013  offered by some institutions under definite restrictions.\n* All withdrawals and deposits are completely the sole decision and responsibility of the account owner unless the parent or guardian is required to do otherwise for legal reasons.\n* Club accounts and other [[savings account]]s &nbsp;\u2013  designed to help people save regularly to meet certain goals.\n\n== Types of accounts ==\n[[File:BBTLexington.jpg|thumb|Suburban bank branch]]\n[[Bank statement]]s are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting standards of the world. Under [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] there are two kinds of accounts: debit and credit. Credit accounts are Revenue, Equity and Liabilities. Debit Accounts are Assets and Expenses. The bank credits a ''credit account'' to increase its balance, and debits a ''credit account'' to decrease its balance.<ref>{{cite book | title= Monetary and Financial Statistics: Compilation Guide | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=a03zkw-5fcEC | author= Statistics Department | year= 2001 | page= 24 | chapter= Source Data for Monetary and Financial Statistics | chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=a03zkw-5fcEC&pg=PT36 | publisher= [[International Monetary Fund]] | location= [[Washington D.C.]] | isbn= 978-1-58906-584-0 | accessdate= 2009-03-14}}</ref>\n\nThe customer debits his or her savings/bank (asset) account in his ledger when making a deposit (and the account is normally in debit), while the customer credits a credit card (liability) account in his ledger every time he spends money (and the account is normally in credit). When the customer reads his bank statement, the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits, and debits for withdrawals of funds. The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement. If the customer is overdrawn, he will have a negative balance, reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement.\n\n===Brokered deposits===\nOne source of deposits for banks is brokers who deposit large sums of money on behalf of investors through trust corporations. This money will generally go to the banks which offer the most favourable terms, often better than those offered local depositors. It is possible for a bank to engage in business with no local deposits at all, all funds being brokered deposits. Accepting a significant quantity of such deposits, or \"[[hot money]]\" as it is sometimes called, puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position, as the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to pay the high interest being paid on the brokered deposits. This may result in risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank. Banks which failed during 2008 and 2009 in the United States during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|global financial crisis]] had, on average, four times more brokered deposits as a percent of their deposits than the average bank. Such deposits, combined with risky real estate investments, factored into the [[savings and loan crisis]] of the 1980s. Regulation of brokered deposits is opposed by banks on the grounds that the practice can be a source of external funding to growing communities with insufficient local deposits.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/04/business/04brokered.html |title=For Banks, Wads of Cash and Loads of Trouble |first=Eric |last=Lipton |author-link=Eric Lipton |first2=Andrew |last2=Martin |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 July 2009 |access-date=13 July 2018 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |location=Macon, Ga}}</ref> There are different types of accounts: saving, recurring and current accounts.\n\n===Custodial accounts===\nCustodial accounts are accounts in which assets are held for a third party. For example, businesses that accept custody of funds for clients prior to their conversion, return or transfer may have a custodial account at a bank for this purposes.\n\n==Globalization in the banking industry==\nIn modern time there has been huge reductions to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry. Increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies, such as Bloomberg, have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world, since they no longer have to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk. The growth in cross-border activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities.\nHowever, despite these reductions in barriers and growth in cross-border activities, the banking industry is nowhere near as globalized as some other industries. In the US, for instance, very few banks even worry about the Riegle\u2013Neal Act, which promotes more efficient interstate banking. In the vast majority of nations around the globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation.\nOne reason the banking industry has not been fully globalized is that it is more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small business and individuals. On the other hand, for large corporations, it is not as important in what nation the bank is in, since the corporation's financial information is available around the globe.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://scholar.google.nl/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=WXWj19cAAAAJ&citation_for_view=WXWj19cAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC |title=To what extent will the banking industry be globalized?
