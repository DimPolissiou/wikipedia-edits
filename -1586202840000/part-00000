Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation Handbook, Fig. 5.5]]\nThis process is similar to the effect of longer wavelengths ([[UVB]]) producing [[sunburn]] in humans. Microorganisms have less protection against UV, and cannot survive prolonged exposure to it.\n\nA UVGI system is designed to expose environments such as [[water tank]]s, sealed rooms and [[HVAC|forced air system]]s to germicidal UV. Exposure comes from [[germicidal lamp]]s that emit germicidal UV at the correct wavelength, thus irradiating the environment. The forced flow of air or water through this environment ensures exposure.\n\n==Effectiveness==\nThe effectiveness of germicidal UV depends on the length of time a microorganism is exposed to UV, the intensity and wavelength of the UV radiation, the presence of particles that can protect the microorganisms from UV, and a microorganism's ability to [[Radioresistance|withstand]] UV during its exposure.\n\nIn many systems, redundancy in exposing microorganisms to UV is achieved by circulating the air or water repeatedly. This ensures multiple passes so that the UV is effective against the highest number of microorganisms and will irradiate resistant microorganisms more than once to break them down.\n\n\"Sterilization\" is often misquoted as being achievable. While it is theoretically possible in a controlled environment, it is very difficult to prove and the term \"disinfection\" is generally used by companies offering this service as to avoid legal reprimand. Specialist companies will often advertise a certain [[log reduction]], e.g., 6-log reduction or 99.9999% effective, instead of sterilization. This takes into consideration a phenomenon known as light and dark repair ([[photoreactivation]] and [[base excision repair]], respectively), in which a cell can [[Pyrimidine dimer#DNA repair|repair DNA]] that has been damaged by UV light.\n\nThe effectiveness of this form of disinfection depends on [[wikt:line of sight|line-of-sight]] exposure of the microorganisms to the UV light. Environments where design creates obstacles that block the UV light are not as effective. In such an environment, the effectiveness is then reliant on the placement of the UVGI system so that line of sight is optimum for disinfection.\n\n[[Dust]] and films coating the bulb lower UV output. Therefore, bulbs require periodic cleaning and replacement to ensure effectiveness. The lifetime of germicidal UV bulbs varies depending on design. Also, the material that the bulb is made of can absorb some of the germicidal rays.\n\nLamp cooling under airflow can also lower UV output; thus, care should be taken to shield lamps from direct airflow, or to add additional lamps to compensate for the cooling effect.\n\nIncreases in effectiveness and UV intensity can be achieved by using reflection. Aluminum has the highest reflectivity rate versus other metals and is recommended when using UV{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.\n\nOne method for gauging UV effectiveness in water disinfection applications is to compute UV dose. The U.S. EPA publishes UV dosage guidelines for water treatment applications.<ref >{{cite web\n  |url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=49846\n  |title=Design Manual: Municipal Wastewater Disinfection\n}}</ref> UV dose cannot be measured directly but can be inferred based on the known or estimated inputs to the process:\n* Flow rate (contact time)\n* Transmittance (light reaching the target)\n* Turbidity (cloudiness)\n* Lamp age or [[fouling]] or outages (reduction in UV intensity)\n\nIn air and surface disinfection applications the UV effectiveness is estimated by calculating the UV dose which will be delivered to the microbial population. The UV dose is calculated as follows:\n\nUV dose \u03bcWs/cm<sup>2</sup>  = UV intensity \u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup>  \u00d7 exposure time (seconds)<ref >[http://www.americanairandwater.com/uv-definitions/index.htm UV dose]</ref>\n\nThe UV intensity is specified for each lamp at a distance of 1 meter. UV intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance so it decreases at longer distances. Alternatively, it rapidly increases at distances shorter than 1m. In the above formula the UV intensity must always be adjusted for distance unless the UV dose is calculated at exactly 1m from the lamp. Also, to ensure effectiveness the UV dose must be calculated at the end of lamp life (EOL is specified in number of hours when the lamp is expected to reach 80% of its initial UV output) and at the furthest distance from the lamp on the periphery of the target area. Some ''shatter-proof'' lamps are coated with a fluorated ethylene polymer to contain glass shards and mercury in case of breakage; this coating reduces UV output by as much as 20%.\n\nTo accurately predict what UV dose will be delivered to the target the UV intensity, adjusted for distance, coating and end of lamp life, will be multiplied by the exposure time. In static applications the exposure time can be as long as needed for an effective UV dose to be reached. In case of rapidly moving air, in AC air ducts for example, the exposure time is short so the UV intensity must be increased by introducing multiple UV lamps or even banks of lamps. Also, the UV installation must be located in a long straight duct section with the lamps perpendicular to the air flow to maximize the exposure time.\n\nThese calculations actually predict the UV fluence and it is assumed that the UV fluence will be equal to the UV dose. The UV dose is the amount of germicidal UV energy absorbed by a microbial population over a period of time. If the microorganisms are planktonic (free floating) the UV fluence will be equal the UV dose. However, if the microorganisms are protected by mechanical particles, such as dust and dirt, or have formed [[biofilm]] a much higher UV fluence will be needed for an effective UV dose to be introduced to the microbial population.\n\n===Inactivation of microorganisms===\nThe degree of inactivation by ultraviolet radiation is directly related to the UV dose applied to the water. The dosage, a product of UV light intensity and exposure time, is usually measured in microjoules per square centimeter, or equivalently as microwatt seconds per square centimeter (\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup>)<!--1 \u00b5W\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup> =  10 mW\u00b7s/m<sup>2</sup> = 0.01 W\u00b7s/m<sup>2</sup>, the latter might be better, giving two-digit values for the ones in this article-->. Dosages for a 90% kill of most bacteria and viruses range from 2,000 to 8,000&nbsp;\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup>. Larger parasites such as cryptosporidium require a lower dose for inactivation. As a result, the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has accepted UV disinfection as a method for drinking water plants to obtain cryptosporidium, giardia or virus inactivation credits. For example, for a 90% reduction of cryptosporidium, a minimum dose of 2,500&nbsp;\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup> is required based on the U.S. EPA UV Guidance Manual published in 2006.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\"/>{{rp|1\u20137}}\n\n==Strengths and weaknesses==\n\n===Advantages===\n{{Details|Disinfectant}}\nUV water treatment devices can be used for well water and surface water disinfection. UV treatment compares favourably with other water disinfection systems in terms of cost, labour and the need for technically trained personnel for operation. [[Water chlorination]] treats larger organisms and offers residual disinfection, but these systems are expensive because they need special operator training and a steady supply of a potentially hazardous material. Finally, boiling of water is the most reliable treatment method but it demands labour and imposes a high economic cost. UV treatment is rapid and, in terms of primary energy use, approximately 20,000 times more efficient than boiling.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\nUV disinfection is most effective for treating high-clarity, purified [[reverse osmosis]] distilled water. Suspended particles are a problem because microorganisms buried within particles are shielded from the UV light and pass through the unit unaffected. However, UV systems can be coupled with a pre-filter to remove those larger organisms that would otherwise pass through the UV system unaffected. The pre-filter also clarifies the water to improve light transmittance and therefore UV dose throughout the entire water column. Another key factor of UV water treatment is the flow rate\u2014if the flow is too high, water will pass through without sufficient UV exposure. If the flow is too low, heat may build up and damage the UV lamp.<ref>Gadgil, A., 1997, ''Field-testing UV Disinfection of Drinking Water'', Water Engineering Development Center, University of Loughborough, UK: LBNL 40360.</ref>\n\nA disadvantage of UVGI is that while water treated by chlorination is resistant to reinfection (until the chlorine off-gasses), UVGI water is not resistant to reinfection. UVGI water must be transported or delivered in such a way as to avoid reinfection.\n\n==Safety ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}\nIn UVGI systems the lamps are shielded or are in environments that limit exposure, such as a closed water tank or closed air circulation system, often with interlocks that automatically shut off the UV lamps if the system is opened for access by humans.\n\nFor human beings, skin exposure to germicidal wavelengths of UV light can produce rapid sunburn and [[skin cancer]].<ref name=\"Liverpool, UVGI\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation\n  |publisher=[[University of Liverpool]]\n  |page=3\n  |url=https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/radiation/pdf/UV_germicidal.pdf\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806185506/https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/radiation/pdf/UV_germicidal.pdf\n  |archive-date=2016-08-06\n  |url-status=dead\n}}</ref> Exposure of the eyes to this UV radiation can produce extremely painful inflammation of the [[cornea]] and temporary or permanent [[vision impairment]], up to and including [[blindness]] in some cases.  UV can damage the [[retina]] of the eye.<ref name=\"Liverpool, UVGI\" />\n\nAnother potential danger is the UV production of [[ozone]], which can be harmful to one's health. The US Environmental Protection Agency designated 0.05 [[parts per million]] (ppm) of ozone to be a safe level. Lamps designed to release UVC and higher frequencies are doped so that any UV light below 254&nbsp;nm wavelengths will not be released, to minimize ozone production. A full-spectrum lamp will release all UV wavelengths, and will produce ozone when UVC hits oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) molecules.\n\nUVC radiation is able to break down chemical bonds. This leads to rapid [[polymer degradation|aging]] of plastics, insulation, [[gasket]]s, and other materials. Note that plastics sold to be \"UV-resistant\" are tested only for UVB, as UVC doesn't normally reach the surface of the Earth. When UV is used near plastic, rubber, or insulation, care should be taken to shield these items; metal tape or aluminum foil will suffice.\n\nThe [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] (ACGIH) Committee on Physical Agents has established a [[threshold limit value]] (TLV) for UVC exposure to avoid such skin and eye injuries among those most susceptible. For 254&nbsp;nm UV, this TLV is 6&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> over an eight-hour period. The TLV function differs by wavelengths because of variable energy and potential for cell damage. This TLV is supported by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and is used in setting lamp safety standards by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. When the Tuberculosis Ultraviolet Shelter Study was planned, this TLV was interpreted as if eye exposure in rooms was continuous over eight hours and at the highest eye-level irradiance found in the room. In those highly unlikely conditions, a 6.0&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> dose is reached under the ACGIH TLV after just eight hours of continuous exposure to an irradiance of 0.2&nbsp;\u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Thus, 0.2&nbsp;\u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup> was widely interpreted as the upper permissible limit of irradiance at eye height.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanairandwater.com/uv-facts/UV-Safety-Study.pdf|title=Safety of Upper-Room Ultraviolet Germicidal Air Disinfection for Room Occupants: Results from the Tuberculosis Ultraviolet Shelter Study|last=Nardell|first=Edward|date=January\u2013February 2008|website=UV And People's Health|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n===Air disinfection===\nUVGI can be used to disinfect air with prolonged exposure. Disinfection is a function of UV intensity and time. For this reason, it is not as effective on moving air, or when the lamp is perpendicular to the flow, as exposure times are dramatically reduced. Air purification UVGI systems can be free-standing units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves microorganisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead microorganisms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.purifier.org/snapcat/iaq.pdf|title=Environmental Analysis of Indoor Air Pollution|publisher=CaluTech UV Air|accessdate=2006-12-05}}</ref>  For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drain pans of cooling systems will keep microorganisms from forming in these naturally damp places.\n\nASHRAE covers UVGI and its applications in indoor air quality and building maintenance in \"Ultraviolet Lamp Systems\", Chapter 16 of its 2008 Handbook, ''HVAC Systems and Equipment''. Its 2011 Handbook, ''HVAC Applications'', covers \"Ultraviolet air and surface treatment\" in Chapter 60.\n\n===Water disinfection===\n[[Image:Steripen in use.jpg|thumb|right|A portable, battery-powered, low-pressure mercury-vapour discharge lamp for water sterilization.]]\n\nUltraviolet disinfection of water is a purely physical, chemical-free process. Even [[parasite]]s such as ''cryptosporidia'' or ''giardia'', which are extremely resistant to chemical disinfectants, are efficiently reduced. UV can also be used to remove chlorine and chloramine species from water; this process is called [[photolysis]], and requires a higher dose than normal disinfection. The sterilized microorganisms are not removed from the water. UV disinfection does not remove dissolved organics, inorganic compounds or particles in the water.<ref>Harm, W., 1980, ''Biological Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation, International Union of Pure and Applied Biophysics'', Biophysics series, Cambridge University Press.{{pn|date=June 2017}}</ref> The world's largest water disinfection plant treats drinking water for New York city.

However, it was recently discovered that ultraviolet radiation can be somewhat effective for treating the microorganism Cryptosporidium. The findings resulted in the use of UV radiation as a viable method to treat drinking water. Giardia in turn has been shown to be very susceptible to UVC when the tests were based on infectivity rather than excystation.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Inactivation of Giardia muris by low pressure ultraviolet light | author = Ware, M.

This is in large part because of concerns that reaction of the chlorine with organic compounds in the waste water stream could synthesize potentially toxic and long lasting [[chlorinated organics]] and also because of the [[environmental risk]]s of storing chlorine gas or chlorine containing chemicals.  Individual wastestreams to be treated by UVGI must be tested to ensure that the method will be effective due to potential interferences such as [[suspended solids]], dyes, or other substances that may block or absorb the UV radiation. According to the [[World Health Organization]], \"UV units to treat small batches (1 to several liters) or low flows (1 to several liters per minute) of water at the community level are estimated to have costs of US$20 per megaliter, including the cost of electricity and consumables and the annualized capital cost of the unit.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsh0207/en/index4.html |publisher=WHO |work=Water, sanitation and health |title=Drinking water quality |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002081406/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsh0207/en/index4.html |archivedate=2008-10-02 }}</ref>\n\nLarge-scale urban UV [[wastewater treatment]] is performed in cities such as [[Edmonton, Alberta]]. The use of ultraviolet light has now become standard practice in most municipal wastewater treatment processes. Effluent is now starting to be recognized as a valuable resource, not a problem that needs to be dumped. Many wastewater facilities are being renamed as water reclamation facilities, whether the wastewater is discharged into a river, used to irrigate crops, or injected into an aquifer for later recovery. Ultraviolet light is now being used to ensure water is free from harmful organisms.\n\n===Aquarium and pond===\nUltraviolet sterilizers are often used to help control unwanted microorganisms in aquaria and ponds. UV irradiation ensures that  pathogens cannot reproduce, thus decreasing the likelihood of a disease outbreak in an aquarium.\n\nAquarium and pond sterilizers are typically small, with fittings for tubing that allows the water to flow through the sterilizer on its way from a separate external filter or water pump.  Within the sterilizer, water flows as close as possible to the ultraviolet light source. Water pre-filtration is critical as water turbidity lowers UVC penetration.\nMany of the better UV sterilizers have long dwell times and limit the space between the UVC source and the inside wall of the UV sterilizer device.<ref>{{cite web |title=UV sterilization; aquarium and pond |publisher=American Aquarium Products |url=http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/AquariumUVSterilization.html }}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Laboratory hygiene===\nUVGI is often used to disinfect equipment such as safety [[goggles]], instruments, [[pipettors]], and other devices.  Lab personnel also disinfect glassware and plasticware this way.  Microbiology laboratories use UVGI to disinfect surfaces inside [[Laminar flow cabinet|biological safety cabinets]] (\"hoods\") between uses.\n\n===Food and beverage protection===\nSince the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] issued a rule in 2001 requiring that virtually all [[Fruit juice|fruit]] and [[vegetable juice]] producers follow [[HACCP]] controls, and mandating a 5-[[log reduction]] in pathogens, UVGI has seen some use in sterilization of juices such as fresh-pressed [[apple cider]].\n\n== Technology ==\n{{see also|Ultraviolet#Artificial_sources}}\n\n===Lamps===\n[[Image:Germicidal Lamp 1.jpg|thumb|right|A 9 W [[germicidal lamp]] in a [[compact fluorescent lamp]] form factor]]\n{{Main article|Germicidal lamp}}\n\nGermicidal UV for disinfection is most typically generated by a [[mercury-vapor lamp]]. Low-pressure mercury vapor has a strong emission line at 254&nbsp;nm, which is within the range of wavelengths that demonstrate strong disinfection effect.  The optimal wavelengths for disinfection are close to 270&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\" />{{rp|2\u20136}}\n\nMercury vapor lamps may be categorized as either low pressure (including amalgam) or medium-pressure lamps. Low-pressure UV lamps offer high efficiencies (approx 35% UVC) but lower power, typically 1&nbsp;W/cm power density (power per unit of arc length). Amalgam UV lamps utilize an amalgam to control mercury pressure to allow operation at somewhat higher temperature and power density. They operate at higher temperatures and have a lifetime of up to 16,000 hours. Their efficiency is slightly lower than that of traditional low-pressure lamps (approx 33% UVC output) and power density is approximately 2\u20133&nbsp;W/cm. Medium-pressure UV lamps operate at much higher temperatures, up to about 800 degrees Celsius, and have a polychromatic output spectrum and a high radiation output but lower UVC efficiency of 10% or less. Typical power density is 30&nbsp;W/cm<sup>3</sup> or greater.\n\nDepending on the quartz glass used for the lamp body, low-pressure and amalgam UV emit radiation at 254&nbsp;nm and also at 185&nbsp;nm, which has chemical effects. UV radiation at 185&nbsp;nm is used to generate ozone.\n\nThe UV lamps for water treatment consist of specialized low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps that produce ultraviolet radiation at 254&nbsp;nm, or medium-pressure UV lamps that produce a [[polychromatic]] output from 200&nbsp;nm to visible and infrared energy. The UV lamp never contacts the water; it is either housed in a quartz glass sleeve inside the water chamber or mounted external to the water which flows through the transparent UV tube. Water passing through the flow chamber is exposed to UV rays which are absorbed by suspended solids, such as microorganisms and dirt, in the stream.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wolfe, R.L. |year=1990 |title=Ultraviolet disinfection of potable water |journal= Environmental Science & Technology|volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=768\u2013773|bibcode=1990EnST...24..768W |doi=10.1021/es00076a001 }}</ref>\n\n=== Light emitting diodes (LEDs) ===\n[[File:UVC LED.jpg|thumb|Compact and versatile options with UVC LEDs]]\nRecent developments in [[Light-emitting diode|LED technology]] have led to commercially available UVC LEDs. UVC LEDs use semiconductors to emit light between 255&nbsp;nm-280&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"Messina 2015\" /> The wavelength emission is tuneable by adjusting the material of the semiconductor. As of 2019, the electrical-to-UVC conversion efficiency of LEDs was lower than that of mercury lamps.

A UVC LED can achieve a longer installed time than a traditional germicidal lamp in intermittent use.  Likewise, LED degradation increases with heat, while filament and HID lamp output wavelength is dependent on temperature, so engineers can design LEDs of particular size and cost to have higher output and faster degradation or lower output and a slower decline over time.\n\n===Water treatment systems===\nSizing of a UV system is affected by three variables: flow rate, lamp power, and UV transmittance in the water. Manufacturers typically developed sophisticated [[Computational fluid dynamics|Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) models validated with [[Bioassay#Environmental bioassays|bioassay]] testing. This involves testing the UV reactor's disinfection performance with either [[Bacteriophage MS2|MS2]] or T1 [[bacteriophage]]s at various flow rates, UV transmittance, and power levels in order to develop a regression model for system sizing. For example, this is a requirement for all drinking water systems in the United States per the EPA UV Guidance Manual.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\">{{Cite web |title=Ultraviolet disinfection guidance manual for the final long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule |url=http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw000/disinfection/lt2/pdfs/guide_lt2_uvguidance.pdf |accessdate=30 January 2011 |date=November 2006 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |location=Washington, DC }}</ref>{{rp|5-2}}\n\nThe flow profile is produced from the chamber geometry, flow rate, and particular turbulence model selected. The radiation profile is developed from inputs such as water quality, lamp type (power, germicidal efficiency, spectral output, arc length), and the transmittance and dimension of the quartz sleeve. Proprietary CFD software simulates both the flow and radiation profiles. Once the 3D model of the chamber is built, it is populated with a grid or mesh that comprises thousands of small cubes.\n\nPoints of interest\u2014such as at a bend, on the quartz sleeve surface, or around the wiper mechanism\u2014use a higher resolution mesh, whilst other areas within the reactor use a coarse mesh. Once the mesh is produced, hundreds of thousands of virtual particles are \"fired\" through the chamber. Each particle has several variables of interest associated with it, and the particles are \"harvested\" after the reactor. Discrete phase modeling produces delivered dose, head loss, and other chamber-specific parameters.\n\nWhen the modeling phase is complete, selected systems are validated using a professional third party to provide oversight and to determine how closely the model is able to predict the reality of system performance. System validation uses non-pathogenic surrogates such as MS 2 phage or ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' to determine the Reduction Equivalent Dose (RED) ability of the reactors. Most systems are validated to deliver 40&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> within an envelope of flow and transmittance.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nTo validate effectiveness in drinking-water systems, the method described in the EPA UV Guidance Manual is typically used by the U.S., whilst Europe has adopted Germany's DVGW 294 standard.

Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation Handbook, Fig. 5.5]]\nThis process is similar to the effect of longer wavelengths ([[UVB]]) producing [[sunburn]] in humans. Microorganisms have less protection against UV, and cannot survive prolonged exposure to it.\n\nA UVGI system is designed to expose environments such as [[water tank]]s, sealed rooms and [[HVAC|forced air system]]s to germicidal UV. Exposure comes from [[germicidal lamp]]s that emit germicidal UV at the correct wavelength, thus irradiating the environment. The forced flow of air or water through this environment ensures exposure.\n\n==Effectiveness==\nThe effectiveness of germicidal UV depends on the length of time a microorganism is exposed to UV, the intensity and wavelength of the UV radiation, the presence of particles that can protect the microorganisms from UV, and a microorganism's ability to [[Radioresistance|withstand]] UV during its exposure.\n\nIn many systems, redundancy in exposing microorganisms to UV is achieved by circulating the air or water repeatedly. This ensures multiple passes so that the UV is effective against the highest number of microorganisms and will irradiate resistant microorganisms more than once to break them down.\n\n\"Sterilization\" is often misquoted as being achievable. While it is theoretically possible in a controlled environment, it is very difficult to prove and the term \"disinfection\" is generally used by companies offering this service as to avoid legal reprimand. Specialist companies will often advertise a certain [[log reduction]], e.g., 6-log reduction or 99.9999% effective, instead of sterilization. This takes into consideration a phenomenon known as light and dark repair ([[photoreactivation]] and [[base excision repair]], respectively), in which a cell can [[Pyrimidine dimer#DNA repair|repair DNA]] that has been damaged by UV light.\n\nThe effectiveness of this form of disinfection depends on [[wikt:line of sight|line-of-sight]] exposure of the microorganisms to the UV light. Environments where design creates obstacles that block the UV light are not as effective. In such an environment, the effectiveness is then reliant on the placement of the UVGI system so that line of sight is optimum for disinfection.\n\n[[Dust]] and films coating the bulb lower UV output. Therefore, bulbs require periodic cleaning and replacement to ensure effectiveness. The lifetime of germicidal UV bulbs varies depending on design. Also, the material that the bulb is made of can absorb some of the germicidal rays.\n\nLamp cooling under airflow can also lower UV output; thus, care should be taken to shield lamps from direct airflow, or to add additional lamps to compensate for the cooling effect.\n\nIncreases in effectiveness and UV intensity can be achieved by using reflection. Aluminum has the highest reflectivity rate versus other metals and is recommended when using UV{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.\n\nOne method for gauging UV effectiveness in water disinfection applications is to compute UV dose. The U.S. EPA publishes UV dosage guidelines for water treatment applications.<ref >{{cite web\n  |url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=49846\n  |title=Design Manual: Municipal Wastewater Disinfection\n}}</ref> UV dose cannot be measured directly but can be inferred based on the known or estimated inputs to the process:\n* Flow rate (contact time)\n* Transmittance (light reaching the target)\n* Turbidity (cloudiness)\n* Lamp age or [[fouling]] or outages (reduction in UV intensity)\n\nIn air and surface disinfection applications the UV effectiveness is estimated by calculating the UV dose which will be delivered to the microbial population. The UV dose is calculated as follows:\n\nUV dose \u03bcWs/cm<sup>2</sup>  = UV intensity \u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup>  \u00d7 exposure time (seconds)<ref >[http://www.americanairandwater.com/uv-definitions/index.htm UV dose]</ref>\n\nThe UV intensity is specified for each lamp at a distance of 1 meter. UV intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance so it decreases at longer distances. Alternatively, it rapidly increases at distances shorter than 1m. In the above formula the UV intensity must always be adjusted for distance unless the UV dose is calculated at exactly 1m from the lamp. Also, to ensure effectiveness the UV dose must be calculated at the end of lamp life (EOL is specified in number of hours when the lamp is expected to reach 80% of its initial UV output) and at the furthest distance from the lamp on the periphery of the target area. Some ''shatter-proof'' lamps are coated with a fluorated ethylene polymer to contain glass shards and mercury in case of breakage; this coating reduces UV output by as much as 20%.\n\nTo accurately predict what UV dose will be delivered to the target the UV intensity, adjusted for distance, coating and end of lamp life, will be multiplied by the exposure time. In static applications the exposure time can be as long as needed for an effective UV dose to be reached. In case of rapidly moving air, in AC air ducts for example, the exposure time is short so the UV intensity must be increased by introducing multiple UV lamps or even banks of lamps. Also, the UV installation must be located in a long straight duct section with the lamps perpendicular to the air flow to maximize the exposure time.\n\nThese calculations actually predict the UV fluence and it is assumed that the UV fluence will be equal to the UV dose. The UV dose is the amount of germicidal UV energy absorbed by a microbial population over a period of time. If the microorganisms are planktonic (free floating) the UV fluence will be equal the UV dose. However, if the microorganisms are protected by mechanical particles, such as dust and dirt, or have formed [[biofilm]] a much higher UV fluence will be needed for an effective UV dose to be introduced to the microbial population.\n\n===Inactivation of microorganisms===\nThe degree of inactivation by ultraviolet radiation is directly related to the UV dose applied to the water. The dosage, a product of UV light intensity and exposure time, is usually measured in microjoules per square centimeter, or equivalently as microwatt seconds per square centimeter (\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup>)<!--1 \u00b5W\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup> =  10 mW\u00b7s/m<sup>2</sup> = 0.01 W\u00b7s/m<sup>2</sup>, the latter might be better, giving two-digit values for the ones in this article-->. Dosages for a 90% kill of most bacteria and viruses range from 2,000 to 8,000&nbsp;\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup>. Larger parasites such as cryptosporidium require a lower dose for inactivation. As a result, the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has accepted UV disinfection as a method for drinking water plants to obtain cryptosporidium, giardia or virus inactivation credits. For example, for a 90% reduction of cryptosporidium, a minimum dose of 2,500&nbsp;\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup> is required based on the U.S. EPA UV Guidance Manual published in 2006.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\"/>{{rp|1\u20137}}\n\n==Strengths and weaknesses==\n\n===Advantages===\n{{Details|Disinfectant}}\nUV water treatment devices can be used for well water and surface water disinfection. UV treatment compares favourably with other water disinfection systems in terms of cost, labour and the need for technically trained personnel for operation. [[Water chlorination]] treats larger organisms and offers residual disinfection, but these systems are expensive because they need special operator training and a steady supply of a potentially hazardous material. Finally, boiling of water is the most reliable treatment method but it demands labour and imposes a high economic cost. UV treatment is rapid and, in terms of primary energy use, approximately 20,000 times more efficient than boiling.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\nUV disinfection is most effective for treating high-clarity, purified [[reverse osmosis]] distilled water. Suspended particles are a problem because microorganisms buried within particles are shielded from the UV light and pass through the unit unaffected. However, UV systems can be coupled with a pre-filter to remove those larger organisms that would otherwise pass through the UV system unaffected. The pre-filter also clarifies the water to improve light transmittance and therefore UV dose throughout the entire water column. Another key factor of UV water treatment is the flow rate\u2014if the flow is too high, water will pass through without sufficient UV exposure. If the flow is too low, heat may build up and damage the UV lamp.<ref>Gadgil, A., 1997, ''Field-testing UV Disinfection of Drinking Water'', Water Engineering Development Center, University of Loughborough, UK: LBNL 40360.</ref>\n\nA disadvantage of UVGI is that while water treated by chlorination is resistant to reinfection (until the chlorine off-gasses), UVGI water is not resistant to reinfection. UVGI water must be transported or delivered in such a way as to avoid reinfection.\n\n==Safety ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}\nIn UVGI systems the lamps are shielded or are in environments that limit exposure, such as a closed water tank or closed air circulation system, often with interlocks that automatically shut off the UV lamps if the system is opened for access by humans.\n\nFor human beings, skin exposure to germicidal wavelengths of UV light can produce rapid sunburn and [[skin cancer]].<ref name=\"Liverpool, UVGI\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation\n  |publisher=[[University of Liverpool]]\n  |page=3\n  |url=https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/radiation/pdf/UV_germicidal.pdf\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806185506/https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/radiation/pdf/UV_germicidal.pdf\n  |archive-date=2016-08-06\n  |url-status=dead\n}}</ref> Exposure of the eyes to this UV radiation can produce extremely painful inflammation of the [[cornea]] and temporary or permanent [[vision impairment]], up to and including [[blindness]] in some cases.  UV can damage the [[retina]] of the eye.<ref name=\"Liverpool, UVGI\" />\n\nAnother potential danger is the UV production of [[ozone]], which can be harmful to one's health. The US Environmental Protection Agency designated 0.05 [[parts per million]] (ppm) of ozone to be a safe level. Lamps designed to release UVC and higher frequencies are doped so that any UV light below 254&nbsp;nm wavelengths will not be released, to minimize ozone production. A full-spectrum lamp will release all UV wavelengths, and will produce ozone when UVC hits oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) molecules.\n\nUVC radiation is able to break down chemical bonds. This leads to rapid [[polymer degradation|aging]] of plastics, insulation, [[gasket]]s, and other materials. Note that plastics sold to be \"UV-resistant\" are tested only for UVB, as UVC doesn't normally reach the surface of the Earth. When UV is used near plastic, rubber, or insulation, care should be taken to shield these items; metal tape or aluminum foil will suffice.\n\nThe [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] (ACGIH) Committee on Physical Agents has established a [[threshold limit value]] (TLV) for UVC exposure to avoid such skin and eye injuries among those most susceptible. For 254&nbsp;nm UV, this TLV is 6&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> over an eight-hour period. The TLV function differs by wavelengths because of variable energy and potential for cell damage. This TLV is supported by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and is used in setting lamp safety standards by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. When the Tuberculosis Ultraviolet Shelter Study was planned, this TLV was interpreted as if eye exposure in rooms was continuous over eight hours and at the highest eye-level irradiance found in the room. In those highly unlikely conditions, a 6.0&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> dose is reached under the ACGIH TLV after just eight hours of continuous exposure to an irradiance of 0.2&nbsp;\u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Thus, 0.2&nbsp;\u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup> was widely interpreted as the upper permissible limit of irradiance at eye height.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanairandwater.com/uv-facts/UV-Safety-Study.pdf|title=Safety of Upper-Room Ultraviolet Germicidal Air Disinfection for Room Occupants: Results from the Tuberculosis Ultraviolet Shelter Study|last=Nardell|first=Edward|date=January\u2013February 2008|website=UV And People's Health|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n===Air disinfection===\nUVGI can be used to disinfect air with prolonged exposure. Disinfection is a function of UV intensity and time. For this reason, it is not as effective on moving air, or when the lamp is perpendicular to the flow, as exposure times are dramatically reduced. Air purification UVGI systems can be free-standing units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves microorganisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead microorganisms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.purifier.org/snapcat/iaq.pdf|title=Environmental Analysis of Indoor Air Pollution|publisher=CaluTech UV Air|accessdate=2006-12-05}}</ref>  For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drain pans of cooling systems will keep microorganisms from forming in these naturally damp places.\n\nASHRAE covers UVGI and its applications in indoor air quality and building maintenance in \"Ultraviolet Lamp Systems\", Chapter 16 of its 2008 Handbook, ''HVAC Systems and Equipment''. Its 2011 Handbook, ''HVAC Applications'', covers \"Ultraviolet air and surface treatment\" in Chapter 60.\n\n===Water disinfection===\n[[Image:Steripen in use.jpg|thumb|right|A portable, battery-powered, low-pressure mercury-vapour discharge lamp for water sterilization.]]\n\nUltraviolet disinfection of water is a purely physical, chemical-free process. Even [[parasite]]s such as ''cryptosporidia'' or ''giardia'', which are extremely resistant to chemical disinfectants, are efficiently reduced. UV can also be used to remove chlorine and chloramine species from water; this process is called [[photolysis]], and requires a higher dose than normal disinfection. The sterilized microorganisms are not removed from the water. UV disinfection does not remove dissolved organics, inorganic compounds or particles in the water.<ref>Harm, W., 1980, ''Biological Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation, International Union of Pure and Applied Biophysics'', Biophysics series, Cambridge University Press.{{pn|date=June 2017}}</ref> The world's largest water disinfection plant treats drinking water for New York city.

However, it was recently discovered that ultraviolet radiation can be somewhat effective for treating the microorganism Cryptosporidium. The findings resulted in the use of UV radiation as a viable method to treat drinking water. Giardia in turn has been shown to be very susceptible to UVC when the tests were based on infectivity rather than excystation.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Inactivation of Giardia muris by low pressure ultraviolet light | author = Ware, M.

This is in large part because of concerns that reaction of the chlorine with organic compounds in the waste water stream could synthesize potentially toxic and long lasting [[chlorinated organics]] and also because of the [[environmental risk]]s of storing chlorine gas or chlorine containing chemicals.  Individual wastestreams to be treated by UVGI must be tested to ensure that the method will be effective due to potential interferences such as [[suspended solids]], dyes, or other substances that may block or absorb the UV radiation. According to the [[World Health Organization]], \"UV units to treat small batches (1 to several liters) or low flows (1 to several liters per minute) of water at the community level are estimated to have costs of US$20 per megaliter, including the cost of electricity and consumables and the annualized capital cost of the unit.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsh0207/en/index4.html |publisher=WHO |work=Water, sanitation and health |title=Drinking water quality |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002081406/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsh0207/en/index4.html |archivedate=2008-10-02 }}</ref>\n\nLarge-scale urban UV [[wastewater treatment]] is performed in cities such as [[Edmonton, Alberta]]. The use of ultraviolet light has now become standard practice in most municipal wastewater treatment processes. Effluent is now starting to be recognized as a valuable resource, not a problem that needs to be dumped. Many wastewater facilities are being renamed as water reclamation facilities, whether the wastewater is discharged into a river, used to irrigate crops, or injected into an aquifer for later recovery. Ultraviolet light is now being used to ensure water is free from harmful organisms.\n\n===Aquarium and pond===\nUltraviolet sterilizers are often used to help control unwanted microorganisms in aquaria and ponds. UV irradiation ensures that  pathogens cannot reproduce, thus decreasing the likelihood of a disease outbreak in an aquarium.\n\nAquarium and pond sterilizers are typically small, with fittings for tubing that allows the water to flow through the sterilizer on its way from a separate external filter or water pump.  Within the sterilizer, water flows as close as possible to the ultraviolet light source. Water pre-filtration is critical as water turbidity lowers UVC penetration.\nMany of the better UV sterilizers have long dwell times and limit the space between the UVC source and the inside wall of the UV sterilizer device.<ref>{{cite web |title=UV sterilization; aquarium and pond |publisher=American Aquarium Products |url=http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/AquariumUVSterilization.html }}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Laboratory hygiene===\nUVGI is often used to disinfect equipment such as safety [[goggles]], instruments, [[pipettors]], and other devices.  Lab personnel also disinfect glassware and plasticware this way.  Microbiology laboratories use UVGI to disinfect surfaces inside [[Laminar flow cabinet|biological safety cabinets]] (\"hoods\") between uses.\n\n===Food and beverage protection===\nSince the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] issued a rule in 2001 requiring that virtually all [[Fruit juice|fruit]] and [[vegetable juice]] producers follow [[HACCP]] controls, and mandating a 5-[[log reduction]] in pathogens, UVGI has seen some use in sterilization of juices such as fresh-pressed [[apple cider]].\n\n== Technology ==\n{{see also|Ultraviolet#Artificial_sources}}\n\n===Lamps===\n[[Image:Germicidal Lamp 1.jpg|thumb|right|A 9 W [[germicidal lamp]] in a [[compact fluorescent lamp]] form factor]]\n{{Main article|Germicidal lamp}}\n\nGermicidal UV for disinfection is most typically generated by a [[mercury-vapor lamp]]. Low-pressure mercury vapor has a strong emission line at 254&nbsp;nm, which is within the range of wavelengths that demonstrate strong disinfection effect.  The optimal wavelengths for disinfection are close to 270&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\" />{{rp|2\u20136}}\n\nMercury vapor lamps may be categorized as either low pressure (including amalgam) or medium-pressure lamps. Low-pressure UV lamps offer high efficiencies (approx 35% UVC) but lower power, typically 1&nbsp;W/cm power density (power per unit of arc length). Amalgam UV lamps utilize an amalgam to control mercury pressure to allow operation at somewhat higher temperature and power density. They operate at higher temperatures and have a lifetime of up to 16,000 hours. Their efficiency is slightly lower than that of traditional low-pressure lamps (approx 33% UVC output) and power density is approximately 2\u20133&nbsp;W/cm. Medium-pressure UV lamps operate at much higher temperatures, up to about 800 degrees Celsius, and have a polychromatic output spectrum and a high radiation output but lower UVC efficiency of 10% or less. Typical power density is 30&nbsp;W/cm<sup>3</sup> or greater.\n\nDepending on the quartz glass used for the lamp body, low-pressure and amalgam UV emit radiation at 254&nbsp;nm and also at 185&nbsp;nm, which has chemical effects. UV radiation at 185&nbsp;nm is used to generate ozone.\n\nThe UV lamps for water treatment consist of specialized low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps that produce ultraviolet radiation at 254&nbsp;nm, or medium-pressure UV lamps that produce a [[polychromatic]] output from 200&nbsp;nm to visible and infrared energy. The UV lamp never contacts the water; it is either housed in a quartz glass sleeve inside the water chamber or mounted external to the water which flows through the transparent UV tube. Water passing through the flow chamber is exposed to UV rays which are absorbed by suspended solids, such as microorganisms and dirt, in the stream.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wolfe, R.L. |year=1990 |title=Ultraviolet disinfection of potable water |journal= Environmental Science & Technology|volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=768\u2013773|bibcode=1990EnST...24..768W |doi=10.1021/es00076a001 }}</ref>\n\n=== Light emitting diodes (LEDs) ===\n[[File:UVC LED.jpg|thumb|Compact and versatile options with UVC LEDs]]\nRecent developments in [[Light-emitting diode|LED technology]] have led to commercially available UVC LEDs. UVC LEDs use semiconductors to emit light between 255&nbsp;nm-280&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"Messina 2015\" /> The wavelength emission is tuneable by adjusting the material of the semiconductor. As of 2019, the electrical-to-UVC conversion efficiency of LEDs was lower than that of mercury lamps. The reduced size of LEDs opens up options for small reactor systems allowing for point-of-use applications and integration into medical devices.<ref name=\"Hessling et al 2016\">{{Cite journal |last=Hessling|first=Martin|last2=Gross|first2=Andrej|last3=Hoenes|first3=Katharina|last4=Rath|first4=Monika|last5=Stangl|first5=Felix|last6=Tritschler|first6=Hanna|last7=Sift|first7=Michael|date=2016-01-27|title=Efficient Disinfection of Tap and Surface Water with Single High Power 285&nbsp;nm LED and Square Quartz Tube|journal=Photonics|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7|doi=10.3390/photonics3010007}}</ref> Low power consumption of semiconductors introduce UV disinfection systems that utilized small solar cells in remote or Third World applications.<ref name=\"Hessling et al 2016\" />\n\nUVC LEDs don't necessarily last longer than traditional germicidal lamps in terms of hours used, and instead have more-variable engineering characteristics and better tolerance for short-term operation. A UVC LED can achieve a longer installed time than a traditional germicidal lamp in intermittent use.  Likewise, LED degradation increases with heat, while filament and HID lamp output wavelength is dependent on temperature, so engineers can design LEDs of particular size and cost to have higher output and faster degradation or lower output and a slower decline over time.\n\n===Water treatment systems===\nSizing of a UV system is affected by three variables: flow rate, lamp power, and UV transmittance in the water. Manufacturers typically developed sophisticated [[Computational fluid dynamics|Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) models validated with [[Bioassay#Environmental bioassays|bioassay]] testing. This involves testing the UV reactor's disinfection performance with either [[Bacteriophage MS2|MS2]] or T1 [[bacteriophage]]s at various flow rates, UV transmittance, and power levels in order to develop a regression model for system sizing. For example, this is a requirement for all drinking water systems in the United States per the EPA UV Guidance Manual.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\">{{Cite web |title=Ultraviolet disinfection guidance manual for the final long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule |url=http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw000/disinfection/lt2/pdfs/guide_lt2_uvguidance.pdf |accessdate=30 January 2011 |date=November 2006 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |location=Washington, DC }}</ref>{{rp|5-2}}\n\nThe flow profile is produced from the chamber geometry, flow rate, and particular turbulence model selected. The radiation profile is developed from inputs such as water quality, lamp type (power, germicidal efficiency, spectral output, arc length), and the transmittance and dimension of the quartz sleeve. Proprietary CFD software simulates both the flow and radiation profiles. Once the 3D model of the chamber is built, it is populated with a grid or mesh that comprises thousands of small cubes.\n\nPoints of interest\u2014such as at a bend, on the quartz sleeve surface, or around the wiper mechanism\u2014use a higher resolution mesh, whilst other areas within the reactor use a coarse mesh. Once the mesh is produced, hundreds of thousands of virtual particles are \"fired\" through the chamber. Each particle has several variables of interest associated with it, and the particles are \"harvested\" after the reactor. Discrete phase modeling produces delivered dose, head loss, and other chamber-specific parameters.\n\nWhen the modeling phase is complete, selected systems are validated using a professional third party to provide oversight and to determine how closely the model is able to predict the reality of system performance. System validation uses non-pathogenic surrogates such as MS 2 phage or ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' to determine the Reduction Equivalent Dose (RED) ability of the reactors. Most systems are validated to deliver 40&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> within an envelope of flow and transmittance.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nTo validate effectiveness in drinking-water systems, the method described in the EPA UV Guidance Manual is typically used by the U.S., whilst Europe has adopted Germany's DVGW 294 standard. For wastewater systems, the NWRI/AwwaRF Ultraviolet Disinfection Guidelines for Drinking Water and Water Reuse protocols are typically used, especially in wastewater reuse applications.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Treatment technology report for recycled water |url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/certlic/drinkingwater/Documents/DWdocuments/treatmenttechnology.pdf |accessdate=30 January 2011 |date=January 2007  |publisher=State Of California Division of Drinking Water and Environmental Management |page={{page needed|date=January 2011}} }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[HEPA]] filter\n*[[Portable water purification]]\n*[[Sanitation]]\n*[[Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures]]\n*[[Solar water disinfection]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|sanitation}}\n* [http://iuva.org/ International Ultraviolet Association]\n\n{{Wastewater}}\n\n[[Category:Radiobiology]]\n[[Category:Ultraviolet radiation]]\n[[Category:Hygiene]]\n[[Category:Waste treatment technology]]\n[[Category:Sterilization (microbiology)]]\n", "name_user": "Widefox", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMethod of operation:fix overlink/link general not specific", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_germicidal_irradiation"}

He commanded U.S. naval forces during two of the most significant naval battles that took place in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theatre]]: the [[Battle of Midway]] and the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. At Midway, Spruance scored the first major victory for the United States over Japan; most historians consider Midway the turning point of the Pacific War.<ref>{{cite book|author=H. P.

From there, he went on to graduate from the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] in 1907, and received further, hands-on education in [[electrical engineering]] a few years later.\n\n==Career prior to World War II==\nSpruance's first duty assignment was aboard the [[battleship]] {{USS|Iowa|BB-4|6}}, an 11,400 ton veteran of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. In July 1907 he transferred to the battleship {{USS|Minnesota|BB-22|2}} and was aboard her during the historic around the world cruise of the [[Great White Fleet]] from 1907 to 1909.\n\nSpruance's seagoing career included command of the [[destroyer]]s {{USS|Bainbridge|DD-1|2}} from March 1913 to May 1914, {{USS|Osborne|DD-295|2}}, three other destroyers, and the battleship {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|2}}.\n\nIn 1916 he aided in the [[Fitting-out|fitting out]] of the battleship {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}} and he served on board her from her [[Ship commissioning|commissioning]] in June 1916 until November 1917. During the last year of [[World War I]] he was assigned as Assistant Engineer Officer of the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard|New York Naval Shipyard]], and carried out temporary duty in [[London]], England and [[Edinburgh]], Scotland.<ref>U.S. Naval Heritage & History Command, [http://www.history.navy.mil/bios/spruancer.htm Biography, Raymond A.

In one incident a distraught officer rushed to report, \"Captain, we've just dropped a depth charge over the stern!\" \"Well, pick it up and put it back,\" was Spruance's measured response.<ref name=\"Tuohy, William 2007\">Tuohy, William. 2007.'' American's Fighting Admirals: Winning the War at Sea in World War II''</ref>\n\nSpruance began attendance at the [[Naval War College]] in 1926, and graduated in 1927. He served as executive officer of USS ''Mississippi'' from October 1929 to June 1931. He also held several engineering, intelligence, staff and Naval War College positions up to the 1940s. He served as an instructor at the Naval War College from 1935 to 1938. He commanded the battleship USS ''Mississippi'' from April 1938 to December 1939, when he was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]]. On February 26, 1940, Spruance reported as commandant of the 10th Naval District with headquarters at [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. On August 1, 1941, he finished his tour in Puerto Rico.\n\n==World War II==\n===Before Midway===\nIn the first months of World War II in the Pacific, Spruance commanded the four [[heavy cruiser]]s and support ships of Cruiser Division Five from his [[flagship]], the heavy cruiser {{USS|Northampton|CA-26|6}}. His division was an element of the task force built around the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} and commanded by [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[William Halsey Jr.|William F. Halsey, Jr.]] Early on, Halsey had led his task force on hit-and-run raids against the Japanese in the western Pacific: striking the [[Marshalls-Gilberts raids|Gilbert and Marshall]] islands in February 1942, [[Wake Island]] in March, and projecting the air power of the [[Doolittle Raid]] against the Japanese homeland in April. These raids were critical to morale{{mdash}}setting a new tone of aggressiveness by U.S. commanders while providing invaluable battle experience for the commanders and sailors of the U.S. Navy.<ref name=\"Buell, Thomas B. 1974\" />\n\n===Midway===\n{{Main|Battle of Midway}}\n\nDuring the third week of May 1942 U.S. naval intelligence units confirmed that the Japanese would{{mdash}}by early June{{mdash}}invade [[Midway Island]]. Capturing and occupying Midway was the brainchild-plan of Commander-in-Chief of the [[Combined Fleet]], Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]. With it he intended to significantly expand the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s outer defense perimeter across the central Pacific; and, he believed, this very powerful stroke against Midway would so severely threaten [[Hawaii]] and [[Pearl Harbor]] that the U.S. government would be induced to sue for peace<ref>{{cite book |last=Costello |first=John |title=The Pacific War 1941\u20131945 |publisher=William Morrow and Company |location=New York |year=1981 |page=268 |isbn=0-688-01620-0 }}</ref> (see [[Battle of Midway#Background|Battle of Midway: Background]]). On the other hand, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]] knew he must intercept the Japanese invasion fleet, and that he must give battle to the enemy aircraft carriers before they could project their overwhelming power against the naval air station at Midway.\n\nLess than two days before launch from Pearl Harbor, Nimitz's commander of the Fleet carrier force, Admiral Halsey, was hospitalized with severe [[shingles]];<ref>{{cite book |last=Costello |first=John |title=The Pacific War 1941\u20131945 |publisher=William Morrow and Company |location=New York |year=1981 |pages=278, 280 |isbn=0-688-01620-0 }}</ref> Halsey immediately recommended Admiral Spruance to Nimitz as his replacement. Although Spruance was proven as a cruiser division commander, he had no experience handling carrier-air combat; Halsey reassured Nimitz, and he told Spruance to rely on his newly inherited staff, particularly Captain [[Miles Browning]], a battle-proven expert in carrier warfare.<ref>{{cite book |last=Parshall |last2=Tully |year=2005 |title=Shattered Sword |location=Washington |publisher=Potomac Books |page=[https://archive.org/details/shatteredswordun0000pars/page/95 95] |isbn=1-57488-923-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/shatteredswordun0000pars/page/95 }}</ref> Spruance assumed command of [[Task Force 16]] with its two [[aircraft carrier|carriers]] {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} and {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} under battle command of Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher]]. Fletcher's flagship {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|6}} had been badly damaged at the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], but{{mdash}}at Nimitz's behest{{mdash}}it was patched-repaired in 'rush' time purposefully to join the Midway operation.\n\nThe U.S. Navy intercept force centered on the three carriers ''Enterprise'', ''Hornet'', and ''Yorktown,'' and their air-attack squadrons. It faced a Japanese invasion fleet organized into two groups: the air-attack task force of four carriers with support ships under command of Admiral [[Ch\u016bichi Nagumo]], and the surface and occupation forces under Admiral [[Nobutake Kond\u014d]] and others. Admiral Yamamoto commanded the combined invasion fleet from aboard his flagship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}}.\n\nThe battle commenced on the morning of June 4; the first several waves of U.S. attack aircraft were badly beaten, both near Midway and at sea around the Japanese task force. Then U.S. [[dive bomber]]s from Spruance's ''Enterprise'' located Nagumo's fleet of four carriers{{mdash}}which, fatefully, were without air cover. Most of Nagumo's attack planes had just returned from the first strike on Midway and were immobilized on the carrier decks, while his [[combat air patrol|CAP cover]] planes were engaged with battling torpedo bombers sent by Spruance from ''Hornet'' (see [[Battle of Midway#Attacks on the Japanese fleet|Battle of Midway: Spruance judged.. and he gambled..]]). The U.S. dive bombers critically damaged three Japanese carriers including Nagumo's flagship {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}}; all three eventually sank. The surviving carrier, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry\u016b||2}}, gave the Japanese some (brief) respite by sending strikes that crippled ''Yorktown''. But several hours later{{mdash}}near the end of daylight hours{{mdash}}a U.S. scout plane located ''Hiry\u016b'' again. Spruance quickly ordered his dive bombers to strike, which fatally damaged the fourth Japanese carrier; it was scuttled the next day.\n\nThe U.S. Navy counterforce sank all four Japanese carriers while losing one of its own, ''Yorktown''. The repulse of the Japanese invasion fleet at Midway, largely directed by Spruance, essentially ended Japanese superiority in naval air-fleet power in the Pacific.\n\nIn 1949 naval historian Samuel E. Morison noted that Spruance was subjected to criticism for not pursuing the retreating Japanese and allowing the surface fleet to escape.<ref>Morison, \"Coral Sea, Midway and Submarine Actions: May 1942 \u2013 August 1942\". (''History of United States Naval Operations in World War II''), Volume IV, p. 142</ref> But in summing up Spruance's performance in the battle, Morison wrote: \"Fletcher did well, but Spruance's performance was superb. Calm, collected, decisive, yet receptive to advice; keeping in his mind the picture of widely disparate forces, yet boldly seizing every opening. Raymond A. Spruance emerged from the battle one of the greatest admirals in American Naval history\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Samuel Eliot |last=Morison |title=The Two-Ocean War: A Short History of the United States Navy in the Second World War |year=1963 |isbn=1-59114-524-4 |page=162 |url={{Google books|Wb7915Exoz0C|plainurl=y}} |via=[[Google Books]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Buell |first=Thomas |title=The Quiet Warrior: A Biography of Raymond Spruance |location=Boston |publisher=Little, Brown and Co |year=1974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/quietwarriorbiog00buel/page/166 166] |isbn=0-316-11470-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/quietwarriorbiog00buel/page/166 }}</ref>\n\nFor his actions at the battle of Midway Rear Admiral Spruance was awarded the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] and cited as follows: \"For exceptionally meritorious service\u2026 as Task Force Commander, United States Pacific Fleet.

Before Midway, a small and fractional U.S. Navy faced an overwhelmingly larger and battle-hardened Japanese [[Combined Fleet]]. After Midway, although the Japanese still held a temporary advantage in vessels and planes, the U.S. Navy and the nation gained confidence and, most critically, time. The setback in the Japanese timetable to encircle the Pacific gave the U.S. industrial machine time to crank up war production, and ultimately, to turn the advantage on Japan in the production of ships, planes, guns, and all the other mat\u00e9riel of war. The Battle of Midway infused the U.S. Pacific Navy with confidence. And with this battle the American forces gained, and afterwards continued to gain, hard combat experience; so the Japanese lost that crucial advantage as well.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Philippine Sea===\nShortly after the Midway battle, Spruance became chief of staff to Admiral Nimitz, and in September 1942 was appointed as Deputy Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet.\n\nIn August 1943 Spruance was placed in command of the Central Pacific Force, which, on April 29, 1944, was redesignated as the [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleet]]. At that time, Admiral Nimitz instituted a unique arrangement in which the command of the vessels which made up the \"Big Blue Fleet\" alternated between Admiral William Halsey Jr., at which time it was identified as the [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]] and Task Force 38, and Admiral Spruance, when it became the Fifth Fleet and Task Force 58. When not in command of the fleet the admirals, and their staffs, were based at Pearl Harbor and planned future operations.\n\nThe two admirals were a contrast in styles. Halsey was aggressive and a risk taker. Spruance was calculating and cautious. Notwithstanding their different personalities, Spruance and Halsey were close friends. In fact, Spruance had a knack for getting along with difficult people, including his friend Admiral [[Kelly Turner]], the hotheaded commander of 5th Fleet's amphibious force. One exception was Admiral [[John Henry Towers|John Towers]], a constant critic of Spruance, whom Spruance came to despise for his naked ambition.<ref>Kent G. Budge, ''The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia''</ref>\n\nMost common sailors were proud to serve under Halsey; most higher-ranking officers preferred to serve under Spruance. Captain George Dyer of the [[light cruiser]] {{USS|Astoria|CL-90|2}}, who served under both Spruance and Halsey, summed up the view of many ship captains:\n\n{{quote|My feeling was one of confidence when Spruance was there. When you moved into Admiral Halsey's command from Admiral Spruance's \u2026 you moved [into] an area in which you never knew what you were going to do in the next five minutes or how you were going to do it, because the printed instructions were never up to date.... He never did things the same way twice. When you moved into Admiral Spruance's command, the printed instructions were up to date, and you did things in accordance with them.<ref>{{cite book |title=America's Fighting Admirals:Winning the War at Sea in World War II |last=Tuohy |first=William |publisher=Zenith Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/americasfighting00tuoh/page/323 323] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7603-2985-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/americasfighting00tuoh/page/323 }}</ref>}}\n\nThis gave rise to the description of Spruance as \"an Admiral's admiral\".\n\n===Truk, Saipan, and Iwo Jima===\nSpruance directed [[Operation Hailstone]] against the Japanese naval base [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in February 1944 in which twelve Japanese warships, thirty-two merchant ships and 249 aircraft were destroyed. This occurred at the same time that [[Richmond K. Turner|Admiral Turner]]'s forces were attacking [[Eniwetok Atoll]] in the Marshalls, about 700 miles to the east. Spruance himself directed a task group of battleships, cruisers and destroyers that left the main body to go after Japanese ships that were fleeing Truk, sinking the light cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Katori||2}} and destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Maikaze||2}}. This was said to be the first time that a four-star admiral took part in a sea action aboard one of the ships engaged.

Hull, ''World War II'' magazine, May 1998 issue</ref>\n\nWhile screening the American invasion of [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]] in June 1944, Spruance also defeated the Japanese fleet in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. Although he broke the back of the Japanese naval airforce by sinking three carriers, two oilers and destroying about 600 enemy airplanes (so many that the remaining Japanese carriers were used solely as decoys in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] a few months later due to the lack of aircraft and aircrews to fly them) Spruance has been criticized for not being aggressive enough in exploiting his success in the Philippine Sea.<ref>{{cite book |last=Buell |first=Thomas |title=The Quiet Warrior: A Biography of Raymond Spruance |location=Boston |publisher=Little, Brown and Co |year=1974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/quietwarriorbiog00buel/page/303 303] |isbn=0-316-11470-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/quietwarriorbiog00buel/page/303 }}</ref> Buell quotes Spruance speaking with Morison:\n\n{{quote|As a matter of tactics I think that going out after the Japanese and knocking their carriers out would have been much better and more satisfactory than waiting for them to attack us, but we were at the start of a very important and large amphibious operation and we could not afford to gamble and place it in jeopardy.}}\n\nHowever, his actions were both praised or understood by the main persons ordering and directly involved in the battle. Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] told him that \"Spruance, you did a damn fine job there. No matter what other people tell you, your decision was correct\". Spruance's fast carrier commander, [[Marc Mitscher]], told his chief of staff [[Arleigh Burke]] that:\n\n{{quote|You and I have been in many battles, and we know there are always some mistakes.

He shifted his flag to the old battleship {{USS|New Mexico|BB-40|6}} of the shore bombardment force after ''Indianapolis'' was struck by a Kamikaze off Okinawa.  When ''New Mexico'' was struck by two kamikaze on the night of 12 May 1945 a hasty search by Spruance's staff found the Admiral manning a fire hose amidship. Determining that ''New Mexico'' was not too badly damaged to remain on station Spruance kept her as his flagship for the rest of the campaign.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Fleet At Flood Tide:America at Total War in the Pacific|last=Hornfischer|first=James|publisher=Bantam Books|page=|year=2016|isbn=978-0-3455-4871-9 }}</ref> Spruance later chose the battleship {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|6}} as his flagship, as the huge ''Iowa'' class battleship had both room for his staff and the speed to keep up with the fast carrier task forces.\n\nSpruance received the Navy Cross for his actions at Iwo Jima and Okinawa.<ref>Military Times, Hall of Valor, [http://militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=21684 Citation, Navy Cross, Raymond A.

The Navy, by law, was limited to four Fleet Admirals; three of these appointments were obvious: Ernest King, Chester Nimitz and William Leahy.  The fourth was a choice between Halsey and Spruance, and after much deliberation, eventually Halsey was appointed in December 1945. Spruance's achievements were acknowledged by the unique distinction of a special act of Congress awarding him Admiral's full pay for life.  Spruance expressed his personal feelings on this matter as follows:\n{{quote|So far as my getting five star rank is concerned, if I could have got it along with Bill Halsey, that would have been fine; but, if I had received it instead of Bill Halsey, I would have been very unhappy over it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Buell |first=Thomas |title=The Quiet Warrior: A Biography of Raymond Spruance |location=Boston |publisher=Little, Brown and Co |year=1974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/quietwarriorbiog00buel/page/436 436] |isbn=0-316-11470-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/quietwarriorbiog00buel/page/436 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nSpruance was [[President of the Naval War College]] from February 1946 until he retired from the Navy in July 1948.\n\nShortly before his retirement, Spruance received the following [[Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal|Letter of Commendation]] from the Secretary of the Navy:\n\n{{quote|Your brilliant record of achievement in World War II played a decisive part in our victory in the Pacific.

His wife, Margaret Dean (1888\u20131985), is buried alongside him, as are Fleet Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], his longtime friend Admiral [[Richmond K. Turner]], and Admiral [[Charles A. Lockwood]], an arrangement made by all of them while living.\n\n==Personality==\nSpruance was an active man who thought nothing of walking eight or 10 miles a day. He was fond of symphonic music, and his tastes were generally simple. He never smoked, and drank little. He enjoyed hot chocolate and would make it for himself every morning. Besides his family, he loved the companionship of his pet schnauzer, Peter. Fit into his 70s, Spruance spent most of his retirement days wearing old khakis and work shoes and working in his garden and greenhouse; he loved to show them to visitors.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Michael D. Hull, ''World War II'' magazine, 1998 issue</ref>\n\nHis achievements in the navy were well known, but himself much less. He did not discuss his private life, feelings, prejudices, hopes or fears, except with his family and his closest friends. He was modest and candid about himself. \"When I look at myself objectively,\" he wrote in retirement, \"I think that what success I may have achieved through life is largely due to the fact that I am a good judge of men. I am lazy, and I never have done things myself that I could get someone to do for me. I can thank heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution.\" About his intellect he was equally unpretentious: \"Some people believe that when I am quiet that I am thinking some deep and important thoughts, when the fact is that I am thinking of nothing at all.

From there, he went on to graduate from the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] in 1907, and received further, hands-on education in [[electrical engineering]] a few years later.\n\n==Career prior to World War II==\nSpruance's first duty assignment was aboard the [[battleship]] {{USS|Iowa|BB-4|6}}, an 11,400 ton veteran of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. In July 1907 he transferred to the battleship {{USS|Minnesota|BB-22|2}} and was aboard her during the historic around the world cruise of the [[Great White Fleet]] from 1907 to 1909.\n\nSpruance's seagoing career included command of the [[destroyer]]s {{USS|Bainbridge|DD-1|2}} from March 1913 to May 1914, {{USS|Osborne|DD-295|2}}, three other destroyers, and the battleship {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|2}}.\n\nIn 1916 he aided in the [[Fitting-out|fitting out]] of the battleship {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}} and he served on board her from her [[Ship commissioning|commissioning]] in June 1916 until November 1917.

He served as executive officer of USS ''Mississippi'' from October 1929 to June 1931. He also held several engineering, intelligence, staff and Naval War College positions up to the 1940s. He served as an instructor at the Naval War College from 1935 to 1938. He commanded the battleship USS ''Mississippi'' from April 1938 to December 1939, when he was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]]. On February 26, 1940, Spruance reported as commandant of the 10th Naval District with headquarters at [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. On August 1, 1941, he finished his tour in Puerto Rico.\n\n==World War II==\n===Before Midway===\nIn the first months of World War II in the Pacific, Spruance commanded the four [[heavy cruiser]]s and support ships of Cruiser Division Five from his [[flagship]], the heavy cruiser {{USS|Northampton|CA-26|6}}. His division was an element of the task force built around the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} and commanded by [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[William Halsey Jr.|William F. Halsey, Jr.]] Early on, Halsey had led his task force on hit-and-run raids against the Japanese in the western Pacific: striking the [[Marshalls-Gilberts raids|Gilbert and Marshall]] islands in February 1942, [[Wake Island]] in March, and projecting the air power of the [[Doolittle Raid]] against the Japanese homeland in April. These raids were critical to morale{{mdash}}setting a new tone of aggressiveness by U.S. commanders while providing invaluable battle experience for the commanders and sailors of the U.S. Navy.<ref name=\"Buell, Thomas B. 1974\" />\n\n===Midway===\n{{Main|Battle of Midway}}\n\nDuring the third week of May 1942 U.S. naval intelligence units confirmed that the Japanese would{{mdash}}by early June{{mdash}}invade [[Midway Island]]. Capturing and occupying Midway was the brainchild-plan of Commander-in-Chief of the [[Combined Fleet]], Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]. With it he intended to significantly expand the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s outer defense perimeter across the central Pacific; and, he believed, this very powerful stroke against Midway would so severely threaten [[Hawaii]] and [[Pearl Harbor]] that the U.S. government would be induced to sue for peace<ref>{{cite book |last=Costello |first=John |title=The Pacific War 1941\u20131945 |publisher=William Morrow and Company |location=New York |year=1981 |page=268 |isbn=0-688-01620-0 }}</ref> (see [[Battle of Midway#Background|Battle of Midway: Background]]). On the other hand, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]] knew he must intercept the Japanese invasion fleet, and that he must give battle to the enemy aircraft carriers before they could project their overwhelming power against the naval air station at Midway.\n\nLess than two days before launch from Pearl Harbor, Nimitz's commander of the Fleet carrier force, Admiral Halsey, was hospitalized with severe [[shingles]];<ref>{{cite book |last=Costello |first=John |title=The Pacific War 1941\u20131945 |publisher=William Morrow and Company |location=New York |year=1981 |pages=278, 280 |isbn=0-688-01620-0 }}</ref> Halsey immediately recommended Admiral Spruance to Nimitz as his replacement. Although Spruance was proven as a cruiser division commander, he had no experience handling carrier-air combat; Halsey reassured Nimitz, and he told Spruance to rely on his newly inherited staff, particularly Captain [[Miles Browning]], a battle-proven expert in carrier warfare.<ref>{{cite book |last=Parshall |last2=Tully |year=2005 |title=Shattered Sword |location=Washington |publisher=Potomac Books |page=[https://archive.org/details/shatteredswordun0000pars/page/95 95] |isbn=1-57488-923-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/shatteredswordun0000pars/page/95 }}</ref> Spruance assumed command of [[Task Force 16]] with its two [[aircraft carrier|carriers]] {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} and {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} under battle command of Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher]]. Fletcher's flagship {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|6}} had been badly damaged at the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], but{{mdash}}at Nimitz's behest{{mdash}}it was patched-repaired in 'rush' time purposefully to join the Midway operation.\n\nThe U.S. Navy intercept force centered on the three carriers ''Enterprise'', ''Hornet'', and ''Yorktown,'' and their air-attack squadrons. It faced a Japanese invasion fleet organized into two groups: the air-attack task force of four carriers with support ships under command of Admiral [[Ch\u016bichi Nagumo]], and the surface and occupation forces under Admiral [[Nobutake Kond\u014d]] and others. Admiral Yamamoto commanded the combined invasion fleet from aboard his flagship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}}.\n\nThe battle commenced on the morning of June 4; the first several waves of U.S. attack aircraft were badly beaten, both near Midway and at sea around the Japanese task force. Then U.S. [[dive bomber]]s from Spruance's ''Enterprise'' located Nagumo's fleet of four carriers{{mdash}}which, fatefully, were without air cover. Most of Nagumo's attack planes had just returned from the first strike on Midway and were immobilized on the carrier decks, while his [[combat air patrol|CAP cover]] planes were engaged with battling torpedo bombers sent by Spruance from ''Hornet'' (see [[Battle of Midway#Attacks on the Japanese fleet|Battle of Midway: Spruance judged.. and he gambled..]]). The U.S. dive bombers critically damaged three Japanese carriers including Nagumo's flagship {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}}; all three eventually sank. The surviving carrier, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry\u016b||2}}, gave the Japanese some (brief) respite by sending strikes that crippled ''Yorktown''. But several hours later{{mdash}}near the end of daylight hours{{mdash}}a U.S. scout plane located ''Hiry\u016b'' again. Spruance quickly ordered his dive bombers to strike, which fatally damaged the fourth Japanese carrier; it was scuttled the next day.\n\nThe U.S. Navy counterforce sank all four Japanese carriers while losing one of its own, ''Yorktown''. The repulse of the Japanese invasion fleet at Midway, largely directed by Spruance, essentially ended Japanese superiority in naval air-fleet power in the Pacific.\n\nIn 1949 naval historian Samuel E. Morison noted that Spruance was subjected to criticism for not pursuing the retreating Japanese and allowing the surface fleet to escape.<ref>Morison, \"Coral Sea, Midway and Submarine Actions: May 1942 \u2013 August 1942\".

Before Midway, a small and fractional U.S. Navy faced an overwhelmingly larger and battle-hardened Japanese [[Combined Fleet]]. After Midway, although the Japanese still held a temporary advantage in vessels and planes, the U.S. Navy and the nation gained confidence and, most critically, time. The setback in the Japanese timetable to encircle the Pacific gave the U.S. industrial machine time to crank up war production, and ultimately, to turn the advantage on Japan in the production of ships, planes, guns, and all the other mat\u00e9riel of war. The Battle of Midway infused the U.S. Pacific Navy with confidence. And with this battle the American forces gained, and afterwards continued to gain, hard combat experience; so the Japanese lost that crucial advantage as well.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Philippine Sea===\nShortly after the Midway battle, Spruance became chief of staff to Admiral Nimitz, and in September 1942 was appointed as Deputy Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet.\n\nIn August 1943 Spruance was placed in command of the Central Pacific Force, which, on April 29, 1944, was redesignated as the [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleet]]. At that time, Admiral Nimitz instituted a unique arrangement in which the command of the vessels which made up the \"Big Blue Fleet\" alternated between Admiral William Halsey Jr., at which time it was identified as the [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]] and Task Force 38, and Admiral Spruance, when it became the Fifth Fleet and Task Force 58. When not in command of the fleet the admirals, and their staffs, were based at Pearl Harbor and planned future operations.\n\nThe two admirals were a contrast in styles. Halsey was aggressive and a risk taker. Spruance was calculating and cautious. Notwithstanding their different personalities, Spruance and Halsey were close friends. In fact, Spruance had a knack for getting along with difficult people, including his friend Admiral [[Kelly Turner]], the hotheaded commander of 5th Fleet's amphibious force. One exception was Admiral [[John Henry Towers|John Towers]], a constant critic of Spruance, whom Spruance came to despise for his naked ambition.<ref>Kent G. Budge, ''The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia''</ref>\n\nMost common sailors were proud to serve under Halsey; most higher-ranking officers preferred to serve under Spruance. Captain George Dyer of the [[light cruiser]] {{USS|Astoria|CL-90|2}}, who served under both Spruance and Halsey, summed up the view of many ship captains:\n\n{{quote|My feeling was one of confidence when Spruance was there. When you moved into Admiral Halsey's command from Admiral Spruance's \u2026 you moved [into] an area in which you never knew what you were going to do in the next five minutes or how you were going to do it, because the printed instructions were never up to date.... He never did things the same way twice. When you moved into Admiral Spruance's command, the printed instructions were up to date, and you did things in accordance with them.<ref>{{cite book |title=America's Fighting Admirals:Winning the War at Sea in World War II |last=Tuohy |first=William |publisher=Zenith Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/americasfighting00tuoh/page/323 323] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7603-2985-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/americasfighting00tuoh/page/323 }}</ref>}}\n\nThis gave rise to the description of Spruance as \"an Admiral's admiral\".\n\n===Truk, Saipan, and Iwo Jima===\nSpruance directed [[Operation Hailstone]] against the Japanese naval base [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in February 1944 in which twelve Japanese warships, thirty-two merchant ships and 249 aircraft were destroyed. This occurred at the same time that [[Richmond K. Turner|Admiral Turner]]'s forces were attacking [[Eniwetok Atoll]] in the Marshalls, about 700 miles to the east. Spruance himself directed a task group of battleships, cruisers and destroyers that left the main body to go after Japanese ships that were fleeing Truk, sinking the light cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Katori||2}} and destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Maikaze||2}}. This was said to be the first time that a four-star admiral took part in a sea action aboard one of the ships engaged. Admiral Spruance commanded with deadly precision, reported an observer.<ref>Michael D. Hull, ''World War II'' magazine, May 1998 issue</ref>\n\nWhile screening the American invasion of [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]] in June 1944, Spruance also defeated the Japanese fleet in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. Although he broke the back of the Japanese naval airforce by sinking three carriers, two oilers and destroying about 600 enemy airplanes (so many that the remaining Japanese carriers were used solely as decoys in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] a few months later due to the lack of aircraft and aircrews to fly them) Spruance has been criticized for not being aggressive enough in exploiting his success in the Philippine Sea.<ref>{{cite book |last=Buell |first=Thomas |title=The Quiet Warrior: A Biography of Raymond Spruance |location=Boston |publisher=Little, Brown and Co |year=1974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/quietwarriorbiog00buel/page/303 303] |isbn=0-316-11470-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/quietwarriorbiog00buel/page/303 }}</ref> Buell quotes Spruance speaking with Morison:\n\n{{quote|As a matter of tactics I think that going out after the Japanese and knocking their carriers out would have been much better and more satisfactory than waiting for them to attack us, but we were at the start of a very important and large amphibious operation and we could not afford to gamble and place it in jeopardy.}}\n\nHowever, his actions were both praised or understood by the main persons ordering and directly involved in the battle. Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] told him that \"Spruance, you did a damn fine job there. No matter what other people tell you, your decision was correct\". Spruance's fast carrier commander, [[Marc Mitscher]], told his chief of staff [[Arleigh Burke]] that:\n\n{{quote|You and I have been in many battles, and we know there are always some mistakes. This time we were right because the enemy did what we expected him to do. Admiral Spruance could have been right. He's one of the finest officers I know of. It was his job to protect the landing force....<ref name=\"Tuohy, William 2007\" />}}\n\nFor most of the war he preferred to use the heavy cruiser  {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}, named for his hometown, as his flagship.  He shifted his flag to the old battleship {{USS|New Mexico|BB-40|6}} of the shore bombardment force after ''Indianapolis'' was struck by a Kamikaze off Okinawa.  When ''New Mexico'' was struck by two kamikaze on the night of 12 May 1945 a hasty search by Spruance's staff found the Admiral manning a fire hose amidship. Determining that ''New Mexico'' was not too badly damaged to remain on station Spruance kept her as his flagship for the rest of the campaign.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Fleet At Flood Tide:America at Total War in the Pacific|last=Hornfischer|first=James|publisher=Bantam Books|page=|year=2016|isbn=978-0-3455-4871-9 }}</ref> Spruance later chose the battleship {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|6}} as his flagship, as the huge ''Iowa'' class battleship had both room for his staff and the speed to keep up with the fast carrier task forces.\n\nSpruance received the Navy Cross for his actions at Iwo Jima and Okinawa.<ref>Military Times, Hall of Valor, [http://militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=21684 Citation, Navy Cross, Raymond A.

Patterson]], presented the [[Army Distinguished Service Medal]] to Admiral Spruance, with citation as follows:\n\n{{quote|Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, U.S. Navy, as Task Force Commander during the capture of the Marshall and Marianas Islands, rendered exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services from January to June 1944. During the joint operations leading to the assault and capture of the important enemy bases, complete integration of Army and Navy units was accomplished under his outstanding leadership, enabling all the forces to perform their closely co-ordinated missions with outstanding success.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Biographies, 20th century collection, Navy Department Library</ref>}}\n\n==Postwar==\n===Retirement===\n[[File:Raymond A. Spruance headstone.JPG|thumb|180px|Spruance's headstone at [[Golden Gate National Cemetery]]]]\nAt the end of the Second World War Congress created a limited number of five-star ranks for the Army and the Navy, designated [[General of the Army]] and [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]].  The Navy, by law, was limited to four Fleet Admirals; three of these appointments were obvious: Ernest King, Chester Nimitz and William Leahy.  The fourth was a choice between Halsey and Spruance, and after much deliberation, eventually Halsey was appointed in December 1945. Spruance's achievements were acknowledged by the unique distinction of a special act of Congress awarding him Admiral's full pay for life.  Spruance expressed his personal feelings on this matter as follows:\n{{quote|So far as my getting five star rank is concerned, if I could have got it along with Bill Halsey, that would have been fine; but, if I had received it instead of Bill Halsey, I would have been very unhappy over it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Buell |first=Thomas |title=The Quiet Warrior: A Biography of Raymond Spruance |location=Boston |publisher=Little, Brown and Co |year=1974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/quietwarriorbiog00buel/page/436 436] |isbn=0-316-11470-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/quietwarriorbiog00buel/page/436 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nSpruance was [[President of the Naval War College]] from February 1946 until he retired from the Navy in July 1948.\n\nShortly before his retirement, Spruance received the following [[Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal|Letter of Commendation]] from the Secretary of the Navy:\n\n{{quote|Your brilliant record of achievement in World War II played a decisive part in our victory in the Pacific. At the crucial Battle of Midway your daring and skilled leadership routed the enemy in the full tide of his advance and established the pattern of air-sea warfare which was to lead to his eventual capitulation...<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />}}\n\n===Later life===\nHe was appointed as Ambassador to the Philippines by President [[Harry S. Truman]], and served there from 1952 to 1955.\n\nSpruance died in [[Pebble Beach, California]] on December 13, 1969 and was buried with full military honors at [[Golden Gate National Cemetery]] near San Francisco. His wife, Margaret Dean (1888\u20131985), is buried alongside him, as are Fleet Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], his longtime friend Admiral [[Richmond K. Turner]], and Admiral [[Charles A. Lockwood]], an arrangement made by all of them while living.\n\n==Personality==\nSpruance was an active man who thought nothing of walking eight or 10 miles a day. He was fond of symphonic music, and his tastes were generally simple. He never smoked, and drank little. He enjoyed hot chocolate and would make it for himself every morning. Besides his family, he loved the companionship of his pet schnauzer, Peter. Fit into his 70s, Spruance spent most of his retirement days wearing old khakis and work shoes and working in his garden and greenhouse; he loved to show them to visitors.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Michael D. Hull, ''World War II'' magazine, 1998 issue</ref>\n\nHis achievements in the navy were well known, but himself much less. He did not discuss his private life, feelings, prejudices, hopes or fears, except with his family and his closest friends. He was modest and candid about himself. \"When I look at myself objectively,\" he wrote in retirement, \"I think that what success I may have achieved through life is largely due to the fact that I am a good judge of men. I am lazy, and I never have done things myself that I could get someone to do for me. I can thank heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution.\" About his intellect he was equally unpretentious: \"Some people believe that when I am quiet that I am thinking some deep and important thoughts, when the fact is that I am thinking of nothing at all. My mind is blank.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nThe destroyers {{USS|Spruance|DD-963|3}}, lead ship of the {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|4}} of destroyers, and {{USS|Spruance|DDG-111|3}}, 61st ship of the {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|4}} of destroyers, were named in his honor.<ref name=DefensegovRelease>{{cite web|title=News Release: Navy Names Two New Guided Missile Destroyers|url=http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=10886|publisher=U.S. Department of Defense|accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe main auditorium of the U.S. [[Naval War College]], [[Newport, Rhode Island]], is [[Naval War College#Buildings and structures|Spruance Hall]].

Although unrecognized, Ryukyuans constitute the largest [[Ethnolinguistic group|ethnolinguistic]] minority group in Japan, with 1.3 million living in Okinawa Prefecture alone. Ryukyuans inhabit the [[Amami Islands]] of Kagoshima Prefecture as well. There is also a considerable [[Ryukyuan diaspora]]. As many as 600,000 more ethnic Ryukyuans and their descendants are dispersed elsewhere in Japan and worldwide; most commonly in [[Brazil]] and, to a lesser extent, in other territories where there is also a sizable [[Japanese diaspora]].

This is possibly explained with partially shared ancestry of the population during the [[J\u014dmon period]] (pre 10,000 BCE \u2013 1,000 BCE) and with the population of the [[Yayoi period]] (1,000 BCE \u2013 300 CE), which were migrants from other parts of [[East Asia]] (specifically [[China]] and the [[Korean peninsula]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saitou|first=Naruya|last2=Tokunaga|first2=Katsushi|last3=Omoto|first3=Keiichi|last4=Niikawa|first4=Norio|last5=Yanagi|first5=Kumiko|last6=Naritomi|first6=Kenji|last7=Kaname|first7=Tadashi|last8=Suto|first8=Yumiko|last9=Mano|first9=Shuhei|date=December 2012|title=The history of human populations in the Japanese Archipelago inferred from genome-wide SNP data with a special reference to the Ainu and the Ryukyuan populations|journal=Journal of Human Genetics|volume=57|issue=12|pages=787\u2013795|doi=10.1038/jhg.2012.114|pmid=23135232|issn=1435-232X}}</ref>\n\nThe Ryukyuans have a specific culture with some [[matriarchal]] elements, native [[Ryukyuan religion|religion]], and [[Okinawan cuisine|cuisine]] which had fairly late (12th century) introduction of [[rice]].

According to the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas|Shan Hai Jing]]'', the Yan had relations with the [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]] (dwarf, short) people living southeast of Korea, who could be related to both the mainland Japanese or Ryukyuan people.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The futile search for the elixir of immortality by [[Qin Shi Huang]], the founder of [[Qin dynasty]] (221 BC\u2013206 BC), in which the emperor tried to cooperate with \"happy immortals\" who dwelt on the islands, could be related to both Japan and Ryukyu Islands.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} There's lack of evidence that the missions by [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC \u2013 220 AD) reached the islands, however as the Japanese did reach Han's [[Luoyang|capital]], notes from 57 CE do mention a general practice of tattooing among the people of \"hundred kingdoms\" in the eastern islands, a practice which was widespread and survived only among the Okinawan's women, Ainu in Hokkaido, and [[Atayal people]] in Taiwan.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} [[Cao Wei]] (220\u2013265) and Han dynasty record show that the inhabitants of western and southern Japan and Okinawa had a lot in common regarding political-social institutions until the 2nd century CE - they were of small stature, bred [[oxen]] and [[swine]], as well were ruled by women, with special influence of women sorceresses, which is related to the Ryukyuan [[Noro (priestess)|Noro]] priestesses which were closely associated with local political power until the 20th century, as well the Ryukyuan swine economy culture until World War II. It is suggested that the mention of a specific sorceress Pimeku, her death and successive conflict, is related to some socio-political challenges of the ancient [[Matriarchy|matriarchal system]].{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\nThe first certain mention of the islands and its people by the Chinese and Japanese is dated in the 7th century. [[Emperor Yang of Sui]], due to previous tradition, between 607-608 held expeditions in search of the \"Land of Happy Immortals\". As the Chinese envoy and the islanders linguistically could not understand each other, and the islanders did not want to accept the Sui rule and suzerainty, the Chinese envoy took many captives back to the court. The islands, by the Chinese named Liuqiu, would be pronounced by the Japanese as Ryukyu. However, when the Japanese diplomat [[Ono no Imoko]] arrived at the Chinese capital he noted that the captives probably arrived from the island of [[Yakushima|Yaku]] south of Kyushu. In 616 the Japanese annals for the first time mention the \"Southern Islands people\", and for the half-century were noted some intruders from Yaku and [[Tanu Province|Tanu]]. According to ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'', in 698 a small force dispatched by Japanese government successfully claimed the [[Tanegashima|Tane-jima]], Yakushima, [[Amami Islands|Amami]], [[Tokunoshima]] and other islands.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} ''Nihongi'' recorded that the [[Hayato people]] in southern Kyushu still had female chieftains in the early 8th century. In 699 are mentioned islands Amami and [[Tokara Islands|Tokara]], in 714 Shingaki and [[Kume Island|Kume]], in 720 some 232 persons who had submitted to the Japanese capital Nara, and at last Okinawa in 753. Nevertheless the mention or authority, over the centuries the Japanese influence spread slowly among the communities.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\n===Gusuku period===\n[[Image:Nakijinjyousi2.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[gusuku]]'' fortification are on the [[Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu]] UNESCO's list.]]\n\nThe lack of written record resulted with later, 17th century royal tales both under Chinese and Japanese influence, which were efforts by local chieftains to explain the \"[[divine right of kings|divine right]]\" of their royal authority, as well the then-political interests of Tokugawa ''sh\u014dguns'' from [[Minamoto clan]] who wanted to legitimize Japanese domination over Okinawa. The tradition states that the founder of [[Tenson Dynasty]] was a descendant of goddess [[Amamikyu]], and the dynasty ruled 17,000 years and had 25 kings i.e. chieftains. However, the 24th throne was usurped from one of Tenson's descendants by a man named Riyu, who was defeated in revolt led by [[Shunten]] (1187 \u2013 1237), lord of [[Urasoe Castle|Urasoe]]. Shunten's parental origin is a matter of debate, according to 17th century romantic tales he was a son of a local Okinawan chief's (''[[Aji (Ryukyu)|anji]]'') daughter and some Japanese adventurer, usually considered [[Minamoto no Tametomo]], while historical and archeological-traditional evidence indicate men from the defeated [[Taira clan]] who fled Minamoto's clan vengeance. [[Shunten Dynasty]] made two additional chieftains, [[Shunbajunki]] (1237-1248) and [[Gihon (Ryukyu)|Gihon]] (1248\u20131259). As Gihon abdicated, his [[sessei]] [[Eiso (Ryukyu)|Eiso]] (1260\u20131299), who claimed Tenson's descent, founded the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#Eiso Dynasty|Eiso Dynasty]].{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\nDuring the [[History of the Ryukyu Islands#Gusuku period|Gusuku period]] (c. 1187\u20131314), with recent chronology dated from c. 900-950 CE,{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=21}}{{sfn|Robbeets|2015|p=28}} Okinawans made significant political, social and economical growth. As the center of power moved away from the seashore to inland, the period is named after many ''[[gusuku]]'', castle-like fortifications which were built in higher places.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}} This period is also notable, compared to mainland Japan, for fairly late introduction of agricultural production of rice, wheat, [[millet]] and the overseas trading of these goods,{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}}<ref name=\"Hammer2006\"/><ref name=\"Shinoda2013\"/> as well during Shubanjunki's rule the introduction of Japanese [[kana]] writing system in its older and simple phonetic form.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} After the years of famine and epidemic during the Gihon's rule, Eiso introduced regular taxation system (of weapons, grains and cloth) in 1264 and as the government gained strength, the control extended from Okinawa toward the islands of Kume, Kerama, Iheya, and Amami \u014cshima (1266). Between 1272 and 1274, as the [[Mongol invasions of Japan]] began, Okinawa on two occasions rejected the Mongols' authority demands. To Eiso's reign period is also ascribed the introduction of [[Buddhism]] into Okinawa.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\n===Sanzan period===\n{{Main|Sanzan period|Ryukyuan missions to Imperial China}}\n[[File:Ryukyu Kingdoms of Sanzan era.jpg|thumb|right|Map of [[Okinawa Island]], showing the [[Sanzan period]] polities.]]\nDuring the rule of Eiso's great-grandson, [[Tamagusuku]] (1314\u20131336), Okinawa became divided into three [[polities]] and began the so-called [[Sanzan period]] (1314\u20131429). The north and largest [[Hokuzan]] polity was the poorest due to forest and mountainous terrain (in which isolation was an advantage), with primitive farming and fishing. The central [[Ch\u016bzan]] polity was the most advantaged due to its developed castle [[town]]s and harbor facilities. The south [[Nanzan]] polity was the smallest, but endured because of good castle positions and sea merchants.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\nIn this period another rapid economical, social and cultural development of Ryukyu began as the polities had developed formal trade relations with Japan, Korea and China. During the [[Satto]]'s reign, Ch\u016bzan made [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|tributary relations]] with China's [[Ming dynasty]] in 1374 as the [[Hongwu Emperor]] sent envoys in 1372 to Okinawa. In the next two decades Ch\u016bzan made nine [[Ryukyuan missions to Imperial China|official missions]] to the Chinese capital, and the formal relations between them endured until 1872 (see [[Imperial Chinese missions to Ryukyu Kingdom]]).{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=39}} Despite significant Chinese economical, cultural and political influence, the polities continued to maintain strong [[autonomy]].{{sfn|Gluck|2008|p=939}}{{sfn|Loo|2014|p=1}} In 1392, all three polities began to send extensive [[Ryukyuan missions to Joseon|missions]] to the Korean [[Joseon]] kingdom. In 1403, Ch\u016bzan made formal relations with the Japanese [[Ashikaga shogunate]], and an [[embassy]] was sent to [[Thailand]] in 1409.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The contacts with Siam continued even in 1425, and were newly made with places like [[Palembang]] in 1428, [[Java]] in 1430, [[Malacca]] and [[Sumatra]] in 1463.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=39}}\n\nAs in 1371, China initiated its maritime prohibition policy ([[Haijin]]) to Japan, Ryukyu gained a lot from its position as [[intermediary]] in the trade between Japan and China. They shipped horses, [[sulphur]] and seashells to China, from China brought ceramics, copper, and iron, from southeast Asian countries bought tin, ivory, spices (pepper), wood ([[sappanwood]]), which they sold to Japan, Korea or China, as well as transporting Chinese goods to [[Hakata Bay]] from where swords, silver and gold were brought.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=42}}{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=28}}\n\nIn 1392, 36 Chinese families from [[Fujian]] were invited by the chieftain of Okinawa Island's central polity (Ch\u016bzan) to settle near the port of [[Naha]] and to serve as diplomats, interpreters, and government officials.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=39}} Some consider that many Ryukyuan officials were descended from these Chinese immigrants, being born in China or having Chinese grandfathers.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ka6jNJcX_ygC&pg=PA145&dq=ryukyu+asked+for+thirty+six+families+fujian#v=onepage&q=ryukyu%20asked%20for%20thirty%20six%20families%20fujian&f=false|title=The eunuchs in the Ming dynasty|author=Shih-shan Henry Tsai|year=1996|publisher=SUNY Press|location=|isbn=978-0-7914-2687-6|page=145|accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref> They assisted the Ryukyuans in advancing their technology and diplomatic relations.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ga-5mPOr2-wC&pg=PR13&dq=ryukyu+asked+for+thirty+six+families+fujian#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The East Asian maritime world 1400-1800: its fabrics of power and dynamics of exchanges|author=Angela Schottenhammer|year=2007|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|location=|isbn=978-3-447-05474-4|page=xiii|accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ddcV_cGegX4C&pg=PA125&dq=ryukyu+asked+for+thirty+six+families+fujian#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Maritime sector, institutions, and sea power of premodern China|author=Gang Deng|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=|isbn=978-0-313-30712-6|page=125|accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref> From the same year onward Ryukyu was allowed to send official students to China i.e. [[Guozijian]].{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=41}} The tributary relationship with China later became a basis of the 19th century Sino-Japanese disputes about the claims of Okinawa.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\n===Ryukyu Kingdom===\n{{Main|Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyuan missions to Edo}}\n[[File:Naha Shuri Castle50s3s4500.jpg|thumb|right|The castle town and [[Ryukyu Kingdom]]'s capital [[Shuri Castle]].]]\n\nBetween 1416 and 1429, Ch\u016bzan chieftain [[Sh\u014d Hashi]] successfully unified the principalities into the [[Ryukyuan Kingdom]] (1429\u20131879) with the [[castle town]] [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]] as royal capital, founded the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#The First Sh\u014d Dynasty|First Sh\u014d Dynasty]], and the island continued to prosper through maritime trade, especially tributary relations with the Ming dynasty.<ref name=\"MasamiIto2009\"/> The period of [[Sh\u014d Shin]]'s (1477\u20131526) rule, descendant from the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#The First Sh\u014d Dynasty|Second Sh\u014d Dynasty]], is notable for peace and relative prosperity, peak in overseas trade, as well as expansion of the kingdom's firm control to [[Kikaijima]], [[Miyako-jima]] and [[Yaeyama Islands]] (1465\u20131524),{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=115}} while during [[Sh\u014d Sei]] (1526-1555) to [[Amami \u014cshima]] (1537).{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=42}}\n\nAfter the [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b Campaign]] (1586\u20131587) by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], his assistant [[Kamei Korenori]], who was interested in southern trade, wanted to be rewarded with the Ryukyu Islands. A paper [[Hand fan|fan]] found during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)]] mentioning a title \"Kamei, Lord of Ryukyu\", reveals that Hideyoshi at least nominally offered the post although he had no legitimate claim upon the islands. In 1591, Kamei ventured with a force to reclaim the islands, but the [[Shimazu clan]] stopped him as they guarded their special relationship with the Ryukyu kingdom. Hideyoshi was not very concerned about the quarrel because the invasion of Korea was more important in his mind.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=151\u2013152}} As the Ming's influence weakened due to disorder in China, Japanese established posts in Southeast Asia, and the Europeans (Spanish and Portuguese) arrived, the kingdom's overseas trade began to decline.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=43}}<ref name=\"MasamiIto2009\"/>\n\nIn the early 17th century during the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] (1603\u20131867), the first ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] intended to subject the kingdom to enable intermediary trade with China, and in 1603 ordered the Ryukyuan king to pay his respect to the shogunate. As the king did not react, with the instruction of the ''sh\u014dgun'', the [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma feudal domain]] of the Shimazu clan in [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] incorporated some of kingdom's territory during the 1609 [[Invasion of Ryukyu]]. They nominally let a certain level of autonomy and independence to the kingdom due to Ming's prohibition of trade with the shogunate, but forbade them trade with other countries except China. The Amami Islands became part of Shimazu's territory, taxes were imposed, making them subordinate in the relations between Japan and China.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=43\u201345}}{{sfn|Loo|2014|p=3}} Until the invasion, the Shimazu clan lords for four centuries had a vague title of the \"Lords of the Twelve Southern Islands\" or \"Southern Islands\", although initially meaning the near Kyushu islands, then covering all the Ryukyu Islands.

The production was encouraged because Satsuma's annual tax deprived Ryukyu's internal resources. Although the production of sweet potatoes and sugar industry grew, the peasants were not allowed to enlarge their fields. The agricultural reforms especially continued under king [[Sh\u014d Kei]] (1713\u20131752) and his [[sanshikan]] advisor [[Sai On]] (1728\u20131752) whose ''Nomucho'' (Directory of Agricultural Affairs) from 1743 became the basis of the agricultural administration until the 19th century.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=46\u201350}} In the Sakishima Islands great part of the tax was paid in textiles made of ramie.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=51\u201352}} The relations with [[Qing dynasty]] improved after their second mission when the first Ryukyuan official students were sent to China in 1688.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=52\u201353}}\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, French politicians like [[Jean-Baptiste C\u00e9cille]] unsuccessfully tried to conclude a French trade treaty with Ryukyu,{{sfn|Smits|2004|p=228}} with only a promise by Shuri government about the admission of Christian missionaries.

As the Chinese envoy and the islanders linguistically could not understand each other, and the islanders did not want to accept the Sui rule and suzerainty, the Chinese envoy took many captives back to the court. The islands, by the Chinese named Liuqiu, would be pronounced by the Japanese as Ryukyu. However, when the Japanese diplomat [[Ono no Imoko]] arrived at the Chinese capital he noted that the captives probably arrived from the island of [[Yakushima|Yaku]] south of Kyushu. In 616 the Japanese annals for the first time mention the \"Southern Islands people\", and for the half-century were noted some intruders from Yaku and [[Tanu Province|Tanu]].

The tradition states that the founder of [[Tenson Dynasty]] was a descendant of goddess [[Amamikyu]], and the dynasty ruled 17,000 years and had 25 kings i.e. chieftains. However, the 24th throne was usurped from one of Tenson's descendants by a man named Riyu, who was defeated in revolt led by [[Shunten]] (1187 \u2013 1237), lord of [[Urasoe Castle|Urasoe]]. Shunten's parental origin is a matter of debate, according to 17th century romantic tales he was a son of a local Okinawan chief's (''[[Aji (Ryukyu)|anji]]'') daughter and some Japanese adventurer, usually considered [[Minamoto no Tametomo]], while historical and archeological-traditional evidence indicate men from the defeated [[Taira clan]] who fled Minamoto's clan vengeance. [[Shunten Dynasty]] made two additional chieftains, [[Shunbajunki]] (1237-1248) and [[Gihon (Ryukyu)|Gihon]] (1248\u20131259). As Gihon abdicated, his [[sessei]] [[Eiso (Ryukyu)|Eiso]] (1260\u20131299), who claimed Tenson's descent, founded the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#Eiso Dynasty|Eiso Dynasty]].{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\nDuring the [[History of the Ryukyu Islands#Gusuku period|Gusuku period]] (c. 1187\u20131314), with recent chronology dated from c. 900-950 CE,{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=21}}{{sfn|Robbeets|2015|p=28}} Okinawans made significant political, social and economical growth. As the center of power moved away from the seashore to inland, the period is named after many ''[[gusuku]]'', castle-like fortifications which were built in higher places.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}} This period is also notable, compared to mainland Japan, for fairly late introduction of agricultural production of rice, wheat, [[millet]] and the overseas trading of these goods,{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}}<ref name=\"Hammer2006\"/><ref name=\"Shinoda2013\"/> as well during Shubanjunki's rule the introduction of Japanese [[kana]] writing system in its older and simple phonetic form.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} After the years of famine and epidemic during the Gihon's rule, Eiso introduced regular taxation system (of weapons, grains and cloth) in 1264 and as the government gained strength, the control extended from Okinawa toward the islands of Kume, Kerama, Iheya, and Amami \u014cshima (1266). Between 1272 and 1274, as the [[Mongol invasions of Japan]] began, Okinawa on two occasions rejected the Mongols' authority demands. To Eiso's reign period is also ascribed the introduction of [[Buddhism]] into Okinawa.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\n===Sanzan period===\n{{Main|Sanzan period|Ryukyuan missions to Imperial China}}\n[[File:Ryukyu Kingdoms of Sanzan era.jpg|thumb|right|Map of [[Okinawa Island]], showing the [[Sanzan period]] polities.]]\nDuring the rule of Eiso's great-grandson, [[Tamagusuku]] (1314\u20131336), Okinawa became divided into three [[polities]] and began the so-called [[Sanzan period]] (1314\u20131429). The north and largest [[Hokuzan]] polity was the poorest due to forest and mountainous terrain (in which isolation was an advantage), with primitive farming and fishing. The central [[Ch\u016bzan]] polity was the most advantaged due to its developed castle [[town]]s and harbor facilities. The south [[Nanzan]] polity was the smallest, but endured because of good castle positions and sea merchants.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\nIn this period another rapid economical, social and cultural development of Ryukyu began as the polities had developed formal trade relations with Japan, Korea and China. During the [[Satto]]'s reign, Ch\u016bzan made [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|tributary relations]] with China's [[Ming dynasty]] in 1374 as the [[Hongwu Emperor]] sent envoys in 1372 to Okinawa. In the next two decades Ch\u016bzan made nine [[Ryukyuan missions to Imperial China|official missions]] to the Chinese capital, and the formal relations between them endured until 1872 (see [[Imperial Chinese missions to Ryukyu Kingdom]]).{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=39}} Despite significant Chinese economical, cultural and political influence, the polities continued to maintain strong [[autonomy]].{{sfn|Gluck|2008|p=939}}{{sfn|Loo|2014|p=1}} In 1392, all three polities began to send extensive [[Ryukyuan missions to Joseon|missions]] to the Korean [[Joseon]] kingdom. In 1403, Ch\u016bzan made formal relations with the Japanese [[Ashikaga shogunate]], and an [[embassy]] was sent to [[Thailand]] in 1409.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The contacts with Siam continued even in 1425, and were newly made with places like [[Palembang]] in 1428, [[Java]] in 1430, [[Malacca]] and [[Sumatra]] in 1463.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=39}}\n\nAs in 1371, China initiated its maritime prohibition policy ([[Haijin]]) to Japan, Ryukyu gained a lot from its position as [[intermediary]] in the trade between Japan and China. They shipped horses, [[sulphur]] and seashells to China, from China brought ceramics, copper, and iron, from southeast Asian countries bought tin, ivory, spices (pepper), wood ([[sappanwood]]), which they sold to Japan, Korea or China, as well as transporting Chinese goods to [[Hakata Bay]] from where swords, silver and gold were brought.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=42}}{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=28}}\n\nIn 1392, 36 Chinese families from [[Fujian]] were invited by the chieftain of Okinawa Island's central polity (Ch\u016bzan) to settle near the port of [[Naha]] and to serve as diplomats, interpreters, and government officials.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=39}} Some consider that many Ryukyuan officials were descended from these Chinese immigrants, being born in China or having Chinese grandfathers.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ka6jNJcX_ygC&pg=PA145&dq=ryukyu+asked+for+thirty+six+families+fujian#v=onepage&q=ryukyu%20asked%20for%20thirty%20six%20families%20fujian&f=false|title=The eunuchs in the Ming dynasty|author=Shih-shan Henry Tsai|year=1996|publisher=SUNY Press|location=|isbn=978-0-7914-2687-6|page=145|accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref> They assisted the Ryukyuans in advancing their technology and diplomatic relations.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ga-5mPOr2-wC&pg=PR13&dq=ryukyu+asked+for+thirty+six+families+fujian#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The East Asian maritime world 1400-1800: its fabrics of power and dynamics of exchanges|author=Angela Schottenhammer|year=2007|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|location=|isbn=978-3-447-05474-4|page=xiii|accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ddcV_cGegX4C&pg=PA125&dq=ryukyu+asked+for+thirty+six+families+fujian#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Maritime sector, institutions, and sea power of premodern China|author=Gang Deng|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=|isbn=978-0-313-30712-6|page=125|accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref> From the same year onward Ryukyu was allowed to send official students to China i.e. [[Guozijian]].{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=41}} The tributary relationship with China later became a basis of the 19th century Sino-Japanese disputes about the claims of Okinawa.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\n===Ryukyu Kingdom===\n{{Main|Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyuan missions to Edo}}\n[[File:Naha Shuri Castle50s3s4500.jpg|thumb|right|The castle town and [[Ryukyu Kingdom]]'s capital [[Shuri Castle]].]]\n\nBetween 1416 and 1429, Ch\u016bzan chieftain [[Sh\u014d Hashi]] successfully unified the principalities into the [[Ryukyuan Kingdom]] (1429\u20131879) with the [[castle town]] [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]] as royal capital, founded the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#The First Sh\u014d Dynasty|First Sh\u014d Dynasty]], and the island continued to prosper through maritime trade, especially tributary relations with the Ming dynasty.<ref name=\"MasamiIto2009\"/> The period of [[Sh\u014d Shin]]'s (1477\u20131526) rule, descendant from the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#The First Sh\u014d Dynasty|Second Sh\u014d Dynasty]], is notable for peace and relative prosperity, peak in overseas trade, as well as expansion of the kingdom's firm control to [[Kikaijima]], [[Miyako-jima]] and [[Yaeyama Islands]] (1465\u20131524),{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=115}} while during [[Sh\u014d Sei]] (1526-1555) to [[Amami \u014cshima]] (1537).{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=42}}\n\nAfter the [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b Campaign]] (1586\u20131587) by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], his assistant [[Kamei Korenori]], who was interested in southern trade, wanted to be rewarded with the Ryukyu Islands. A paper [[Hand fan|fan]] found during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)]] mentioning a title \"Kamei, Lord of Ryukyu\", reveals that Hideyoshi at least nominally offered the post although he had no legitimate claim upon the islands. In 1591, Kamei ventured with a force to reclaim the islands, but the [[Shimazu clan]] stopped him as they guarded their special relationship with the Ryukyu kingdom. Hideyoshi was not very concerned about the quarrel because the invasion of Korea was more important in his mind.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=151\u2013152}} As the Ming's influence weakened due to disorder in China, Japanese established posts in Southeast Asia, and the Europeans (Spanish and Portuguese) arrived, the kingdom's overseas trade began to decline.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=43}}<ref name=\"MasamiIto2009\"/>\n\nIn the early 17th century during the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] (1603\u20131867), the first ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] intended to subject the kingdom to enable intermediary trade with China, and in 1603 ordered the Ryukyuan king to pay his respect to the shogunate. As the king did not react, with the instruction of the ''sh\u014dgun'', the [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma feudal domain]] of the Shimazu clan in [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] incorporated some of kingdom's territory during the 1609 [[Invasion of Ryukyu]]. They nominally let a certain level of autonomy and independence to the kingdom due to Ming's prohibition of trade with the shogunate, but forbade them trade with other countries except China. The Amami Islands became part of Shimazu's territory, taxes were imposed, making them subordinate in the relations between Japan and China.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=43\u201345}}{{sfn|Loo|2014|p=3}} Until the invasion, the Shimazu clan lords for four centuries had a vague title of the \"Lords of the Twelve Southern Islands\" or \"Southern Islands\", although initially meaning the near Kyushu islands, then covering all the Ryukyu Islands.

The production was encouraged because Satsuma's annual tax deprived Ryukyu's internal resources. Although the production of sweet potatoes and sugar industry grew, the peasants were not allowed to enlarge their fields. The agricultural reforms especially continued under king [[Sh\u014d Kei]] (1713\u20131752) and his [[sanshikan]] advisor [[Sai On]] (1728\u20131752) whose ''Nomucho'' (Directory of Agricultural Affairs) from 1743 became the basis of the agricultural administration until the 19th century.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=46\u201350}} In the Sakishima Islands great part of the tax was paid in textiles made of ramie.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=51\u201352}} The relations with [[Qing dynasty]] improved after their second mission when the first Ryukyuan official students were sent to China in 1688.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=52\u201353}}\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, French politicians like [[Jean-Baptiste C\u00e9cille]] unsuccessfully tried to conclude a French trade treaty with Ryukyu,{{sfn|Smits|2004|p=228}} with only a promise by Shuri government about the admission of Christian missionaries.

The status of women in traditional society is higher than in China and Japan. Although the contemporary kinship system is patrilineal and [[Patrilocal residence|patrilocal]], until the 20th century it was often bilateral and [[Matrilocal residence|matrilocal]], with common village endogamy.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=54\u201355}} [[Shisa]] statues can often be seen on or in front of houses\u2014this relates to the ancient Ryukyuan belief that the male spirit is the spirit of the outside and the female spirit is the spirit of the inside.

The noro's duty was to preserve the generational fire in the hearth, a communal treasure, resulting with tabu system about the fire custodian in which they had to be virgins to maintain close communication with the ancestors. The office became hereditary, usually of the noro's brother's female child. The center of worship was represented by three heartstones within or near the house.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The belief in the spiritual predominance of the sister was more prominent in Southern Ryukyus.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}}\n\nThe introduction of Buddhism is ascribed to a 13th century priest from Japan (mostly funeral rites{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}}), while the 14th century trade relations resulted with [[Korean Buddhism]] influences (including some in architecture), as well Shinto practices from Japan.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} Buddhism and native religion were ideological basis until 18th century, when [[Confucianism]] gradually and officially became government ideology during [[Sh\u014d On]] (1795\u20131802), much to the dismay of [[Kumemura]].{{sfn|Smits|2004|p=240}} It was mostly important to the upper class families.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}} Among the Catholic converts was not lost the former religious consciousness.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}}\n\nUntil the 18th century, the Ryukyuan kings visited the [[Sefa-utaki]] (historical sacred place) caves for worship. Another traditional sacred places are springs Ukinju-Hain-ju, where was placed the first rice plantation, and small island Kudaka, where the \"five fruits and grains\" were introduced by divine people, perhaps strangers with agricultural techniques.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The foremost account, which claimed common origin between the Japanese and Ryukyuan people, was made-up by [[Sh\u014d Sh\u014dken]] in the 17th century, to end up the pilgrimage of the Ryukyu king and chief priestess to the Kudaka island.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=46}}\n\nDuring the Meiji period the government replaced Buddhism with Shintoism as the islands' state religion,{{sfn|Caprio|2014|p=66}} and ordered; rearrangement of statues and redesign of shrines and temples to incorporate native deities into national Shinto pantheon; Shinto worship preceded native, Buddhist, or Christian ritual; transformation of local divinities into guardian gods.{{sfn|Rabson|2007|p=4}} In the 1920s was ordered building of Shinto shrines and remodelling of previous with Shinto architectural symbols, paid by local tax money, which was a financial burden due to the collapse of sugar prices in 1921 which devastated Okinawa's economy.{{sfn|Rabson|2007|p=5}} In 1932 were ordered to house and support Shinto clergy from the mainland.{{sfn|Rabson|2007|p=5}}\n\nMost Ryukyuans of the younger generations are not serious adherents of the native religion anymore. Additionally, since being under Japanese control, [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism]] are also practiced and typically mixed with local beliefs and practices.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{main|Okinawan cuisine}}\n\nOkinawan food is rich in [[vitamin]]s and [[minerals]] and is a good balance of [[protein]], [[fat]]s, and [[carbohydrate]]s.

Most famous to tourists is the ''[[Momordica charantia]]'', ''g\u014dya'' (bitter melon), which is often mixed into a representative Okinawan [[Stir frying|stir fry]] dish known as [[Chanpuru|champur\u016b]] ([[Goya champuru]]). [[K\u014dr\u0113gusu]] is a common [[hot sauce]] [[condiment]] used in various dishes including [[noodle soup]] [[Okinawa soba]]. Some specifically consumed algae include [[Caulerpa lentillifera]]. Traditional sweets include [[chinsuko]], [[hirayachi]], [[sata andagi]], and [[muchi]]. Local beverages include juice from ''[[Citrus depressa]]'', [[turmeric tea]] (''ukoncha''), and the alcoholic beverage [[awamori]].\n\nThe weight-loss [[Okinawa diet]] derives from their cuisine and has only 30% of the sugar and 15% of the grains of the average Japanese dietary intake.<ref name=\"Willcox2007\">{{Citation  |last=Willcox |first=B.

Her father was a cloth merchant and her mother was a homemaker. Following a bank crash that wiped out their fortune, the family relocated to [[Bombay]] in 1951. She started her career as a schoolgirl as a group dancer in films to help support her family after her father's death in a road accident. She picked up more films after she finished her schooling.\n\n== Career ==\n\nBela Bose began to receive independent credit from the late 1950s. Her big break came when she was asked to do a dance number with [[Raj Kapoor]] in ''Main Nashe Mein Hoon'', released in 1959. Her first leading role was in ''Sautela Bhai'' (1962) opposite Guru Dutt at age 21. She honed her acting skills performing in Bengali plays. Her career consisted of more than 150 films. In ''Hawa Mahal''  (1962), she played the role of Helen's sister.<ref name=\"Pinto2006\">{{cite book|first=Jerry |last=Pinto|title=Helen: The Life and Times of an H-bomb|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Ng_vVIcq5yQC|page=241}}|year=2006|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-303124-6|pages=241\u2013}}</ref> She was often called upon to play the role of a vamp.

After TSR acquired [[Simulation Publications|SPI]] in March 1982, the Blumes declared that they had \"bought assets but not liabilities\". Actually, SPI owed money to their printers, who refused to release the plates for printing SPI's games until TSR repaid SPI's bills.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|14}} On a more successful note, the Blumes moved into the book trade with popular series such as ''[[Endless Quest]]''.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|14}} The Blumes also moved into toy manufacturing, metal miniatures, and even the [[needlecraft]] business.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|15}} In the company's main business of role-playing games, the Blumes oversaw the creation of the new role-playing lines ''[[Dragonlance]]'' and ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (role-playing game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]''.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|16}} However, all of these new ventures were expensive, and by 1984, although TSR Inc. was the games industry leader, grossing $30 million, it was barely breaking even and had debts of $1.5 million. The Blume brothers began to shop around for someone to buy the company.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|171}}   \n\nWhen Gygax heard that TSR was being shopped around, he returned to Lake Geneva. After some investigation of the company finances, Gygax charged that the financial crisis was due to mismanagement by Kevin Blume: excess inventory, overstaffing, too many company cars, and some questionable (and expensive) projects such as dredging up a 19th-century shipwreck.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|172}} Gygax persuaded the board of directors to remove Kevin Blume as president.<ref name=\"believer\"/> The final vote was 4\u20131, with Brian Blume abstaining.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|16}} However, the outside directors still believed the company's financial problems were terminal and the company needed to be sold. In an effort to prevent this, in March 1985 Gygax exercised his 700-share stock option, giving him just over 50% control. He appointed himself president and CEO, and in order to bring some financial stability to TSR, he hired a company manager, [[Lorraine Williams]],<ref name=\"believer\"/> who dismissed the three outside directors.<ref name=\"Kyngdoms\"/> Bringing Williams on board backfired for Gygax when in October 1985, Brian Blume revealed that he had triggered his own 560-share option, and then he and his brother Kevin had sold all their shares to Williams, leaving her as the majority shareholder.

By 1981, the Blume brothers were increasingly unhappy with Gygax's conservative approach to the business, so using their greater stock ownership, they effectively took control by splitting TSR Hobbies into TSR, Inc., and TSR Entertainment, Inc.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|13}}  While Kevin Blume became president of TSR, Inc., Gygax was made president of TSR Entertainment, Inc.,<ref name=\"Dragon #103\">{{cite journal | title = TSR Profiles | journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] | issue = #103 | page = 56 | publisher = TSR, Inc. | location = [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]] | date = November 1985}}</ref> and the Blumes sent him to Hollywood to develop TV and movie opportunities.<ref name=designers />{{rp|13}} \n\nBank creditors insisted on the appointment of three independent directors with business experience,<ref name=\"ambush\">{{cite web| url=https://medium.com/@increment/the-ambush-at-sheridan-springs-3a29d07f6836 | title=The Ambush at Sheridan Springs| last = Peterson | first = Jon| date = 2014-07-28 | accessdate=2018-11-15}}</ref> so the Blumes brought in three outside directors from the [[American Management Association]] \u2013 a lawyer from a large Milwaukee firm, a personnel officer from a Milwaukee area company, and an owner of a company that made medical equipment \u2013 to enlarge the Board of Directors to six people.

After TSR acquired [[Simulation Publications|SPI]] in March 1982, the Blumes declared that they had \"bought assets but not liabilities\". Actually, SPI owed money to their printers, who refused to release the plates for printing SPI's games until TSR repaid SPI's bills.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|14}} On a more successful note, the Blumes moved into the book trade with popular series such as ''[[Endless Quest]]''.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|14}} The Blumes also moved into toy manufacturing, metal miniatures, and even the [[needlecraft]] business.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|15}} In the company's main business of role-playing games, the Blumes oversaw the creation of the new role-playing lines ''[[Dragonlance]]'' and ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (role-playing game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]''.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|16}} However, all of these new ventures were expensive, and by 1984, although TSR Inc. was the games industry leader, grossing $30 million, it was barely breaking even and had debts of $1.5 million. The Blume brothers began to shop around for someone to buy the company.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|171}}   \n\nWhen Gygax heard that TSR was being shopped around, he returned to Lake Geneva. After some investigation of the company finances, Gygax charged that the financial crisis was due to mismanagement by Kevin Blume: excess inventory, overstaffing, too many company cars, and some questionable (and expensive) projects such as dredging up a 19th-century shipwreck.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|172}} Gygax persuaded the board of directors to remove Kevin Blume as president.<ref name=\"believer\"/> The final vote was 4\u20131, with Brian Blume, abstaining.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|16}} However, the outside directors still believed the company's financial problems were terminal and the company needed to be sold. In an effort to prevent this, in March 1985 Gygax exercised his 700-share stock option, giving him just over 50% control. He appointed himself president and CEO, and in order to bring some financial stability to TSR, he hired a company manager, [[Lorraine Williams]],<ref name=\"believer\"/> who dismissed the three outside directors.<ref name=\"Kyngdoms\"/> Bringing Williams on board backfired for Gygax when in October 1985, Brian Blume revealed that he had triggered his own 560-share option, and then he and his brother Kevin had sold all their shares to Williams, leaving her as the majority shareholder. Gygax took TSR to court in a bid to block the Blumes' sale of their shares to Williams, but he lost,<ref name=\"gamespy2.1\">{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/538/538820p1.html|title=Gary Gygax Interview \u2013 Part 2 (page 1)|accessdate=October 3, 2008|date=August 16, 2004 |last=Rausch|first=Allen|work=[[GameSpy]]|publisher=IGN Entertainment|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917181104/http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/538/538820p1.html |archivedate=September 17, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> and Williams replaced Gygax as president and CEO.\n\nHaving sold all his company shares, Brian Blume stepped down from the board of directors and left TSR.<ref name=\"believer\"/>\n\n===Subsequent game work===\nBlume later worked as a [[cartographer]], making maps for numerous [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf]] supplements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showcreator&creatorid=645|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426063103/http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showcreator&creatorid=645|archivedate=April 26, 2005|title=Pen & Paper listing for Brian Blume|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Later Life===\nBlume died on March 27, 2020, at the Lakeland Nursing Home in [[Elkhorn, Wisconsin]] from [[Lewy Body Dementia]] and [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name=obituary />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{D&D topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blume, Brian}}\n[[Category:1950 births]]\n[[Category:2020 deaths]]\n[[Category:Dungeons & Dragons game designers]]\n[[Category:Role-playing game designers]]\n", "name_user": "Guinness323", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePower struggle within TSR:remove comma", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Blume"}
