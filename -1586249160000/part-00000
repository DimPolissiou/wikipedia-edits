It was created out of the Slovak part of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] one day before the start of the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]]. The Slovak Republic controlled the majority of the territory of present-day [[Slovakia]] but without its current southern and eastern parts, which had been ceded to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]] in 1938. The Republic bordered Germany and constituent parts of \"[[Gro\u00dfdeutschland]]\": the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the [[General Government]] (the German-occupied remnant of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]) \u2013 along with independent Hungary.\n\nGermany recognized the Slovak State, as did several other states, including [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Estonia]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Lithuania]], [[Manchukuo]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[Vatican City]]. The majority of the [[Allies of World War II]] never recognized the existence of the Slovak Republic. The Soviet Union [[Czech Republic\u2013Russia relations#History|nullified its recognition]] after Slovakia joined [[Operation Barbarossa|the invasion of the USSR in 1941]].\n\n==Name==\nThe official name of the country was the Slovak State (Slovak: ''Slovensk\u00fd \u0161t\u00e1t'') from 14 March to 21 July 1939 (until the adoption of the [[Constitution of Slovakia (1939)|Constitution]]), and the Slovak Republic (Slovak: ''Slovensk\u00e1 republika'') from 21 July 1939 to its end in April 1945. The country is often referred to historically as the ''First Slovak Republic'' (Slovak: ''prv\u00e1 Slovensk\u00e1 republika'') to distinguish it from the contemporary (Second) [[Slovak Republic]], Slovakia, which is not considered its legal [[Succession of states|successor state]].

As the Nazi F\u00fchrer [[Adolf Hitler]] was preparing a mobilisation into Czech territory and creation of his [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], he had various plans for Slovakia. German officials were initially misinformed by the Hungarians that the Slovaks wanted to join Hungary. Germany decided to make Slovakia a separate puppet state under the influence of Germany, and a potential strategic base for German attacks on [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and other regions.\n\nOn 13 March 1939, Hitler invited [[Monsignor]] [[Jozef Tiso]] (the Slovak ex-[[prime minister]] who had been deposed by Czechoslovak troops several days earlier) to [[Berlin]] and urged him to proclaim Slovakia's independence. Hitler added that, if Tiso did not consent, he would have no interest in Slovakia's fate and would leave it to the territorial claims of Hungary and Poland. During the meeting, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] passed on a report claiming that Hungarian troops were approaching the Slovak borders. Tiso refused to make such a decision himself, after which he was allowed by Hitler to organise a meeting of the Slovak parliament (\"Diet of the Slovak Land\") which would approve Slovakia's independence.\n\nOn 14 March, the Slovak parliament convened and heard Tiso's report on his discussion with Hitler as well as on a possible declaration of independence. Some of the deputies were skeptical of making such a move, among other reasons due to the fact that some worried that the Slovak state would be too small and with a strong [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Hungarian minority]].<ref name=\"RadioPrague\">{{cite web |author=Dominik J\u016fn interviewing Professor Jan Rychl\u00edk |title=Czechs and Slovaks - more than just neighbours |publisher=Radio Prague |year=2016 |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/special/czechs-and-slovaks-more-than-just-neighbours |accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> The debate was quickly brought to a head when [[Franz Karmasin]], leader of the [[Germans in Slovakia|German minority]] in Slovakia, said that any delay in declaring independence would result in Slovakia being divided between Hungary and Germany. Under these circumstances, Parliament unanimously declared Slovak independence, thus creating the first Slovak state in history.<ref name=\"RadioPrague\"/> Jozef Tiso was appointed the first Prime Minister of the new republic. The next day, Tiso sent a telegram (which had actually been composed the previous day in Berlin) asking the Reich to take over the protection of the newly minted state.

With the impending German invasion of Poland planned for September 1939, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (OKW) requested the assistance of Slovakia. Although the Slovak military was only six months old, it formed a small mobile [[Field Army Bernol\u00e1k|combat group]] consisting of a number of infantry and artillery battalions. Two combat groups were created for the campaign in Poland for use alongside the Germans. The first group was a brigade-sized formation that consisted of six infantry battalions, two artillery battalions, and a company of [[combat engineer]]s, all commanded by Anton\u00edn Pulanich. The second group was a mobile formation that consisted of two battalions of combined cavalry and motorcycle recon troops along with nine motorised artillery batteries, all commanded by Gustav Mal\u00e1r. The two groups reported to the headquarters of the [[1st Infantry Division (Slovak Republic)|1st]] and 3rd Slovak Infantry Divisions. The two combat groups fought while pushing through the [[Nowy S\u0105cz]] and [[Dukla Pass|Dukla Mountain Passes]], advancing towards [[D\u0119bica]] and [[Tarn\u00f3w]] in the region of southern Poland.\n\n===Slovak forces during the campaign against the Soviet Union===\n[[File:Slovak soldiers force Red Army soldiers to surrender.png|thumb|Slovak soldiers force Red Army soldiers to surrender]]\nThe Slovak military participated in the war on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] against the Soviet Union. The Slovak Expeditionary Army Group of about 45,000 entered the Soviet Union shortly after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack]]. This army lacked logistic and transportation support, so a much smaller unit, the Slovak Mobile Command (Pilfousek Brigade), was formed from units selected from this force; the rest of the Slovak army was relegated to rear-area security duty. The Slovak Mobile Command was attached to the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 17th Army]] (as was the Hungarian [[Gyorshadtest|Carpathian Group]] also) and shortly thereafter given over to direct German command, the Slovaks lacking the command infrastructure to exercise effective operational control. This unit fought with the 17th Army through July 1941, including at the [[Battle of Uman]].<ref name=Felgrau>{{cite web |url=http://www.feldgrau.com/a-slovakia.html |title=Slovak Axis Forces in WWII |author=Jason Pipes |work=Feldgrau |accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of August 1941, the Slovak Mobile Command was dissolved and instead two infantry divisions were formed from the Slovak Expeditionary Army Group. The Slovak 2nd Division was a [[Security Division (Wehrmacht)|security division]], but the Slovak 1st Division was a front-line unit which fought in the campaigns of 1941 and 1942, reaching the [[Battle of the Caucasus|Caucasus area]] with [[Army Group B]]. The Slovak 1st Division then shared the fate of the German southern forces, losing their heavy equipment in the [[Kuban bridgehead]], then being badly mangled near [[Melitopol]] in southern Ukraine. In June 1944, the remnant of the division, no longer considered fit for combat due to low morale, was disarmed and the personnel assigned to construction work, a fate which had already befallen the Slovak 2nd Division earlier for the same reason.<ref name=Felgrau/>\n\n===Slovak National Uprising===\n{{Main|Slovak National Uprising}}\n[[File:Karte Slowakischer Nationalaufstand 1944 - Aufstandsbeginn.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Situation map in first days of Slovak National Uprising]]\nIn the 1944 [[Slovak National Uprising]], many Slovak units sided with the Slovak resistance and rebelled against Tiso's collaborationist government, while others helped German forces put the uprising down.\n\n==International relations==\n[[File:Ante Paveli\u0107, Karl Murga\u0161 and Mladen Lorkovi\u0107.jpg|thumb|Slovak Ambassador to [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]], Karel Murga\u0161 (in the middle) with Croatian ''[[Poglavnik]]'' [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] and Foreign Minister [[Mladen Lorkovi\u0107]]]]\n\nFrom the beginning, the Slovak Republic was under the influence of Germany.

Minorities included Germans (4.8 percent), Czechs (2.9 percent), [[Rusyns]] (2.6 percent), Hungarians (2.1 percent), Jews (1.1 percent), and [[Romani people]] (0.9 percent).{{sfn|Kamenec|2011a|p=175}} Seventy-five percent of Slovaks were Catholics, and most of the remainder belonged to the [[Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Slovakia|Lutheran]] and [[Slovak Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] churches.{{sfn|Rothkirchen|2001|p=596}} 50% of the population were employed in agriculture. The state was divided in six counties (''[[\u017eupa|\u017eupy]]''), 58 districts (''[[okres]]y'') and 2659 municipalities. The capital Bratislava had over 140,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe state continued the legal system of Czechoslovakia, which was modified only gradually. According to the Constitution of 1939, the \"President\" (Jozef Tiso) was the head of the state, the \"Assembly/Diet of the Slovak Republic\" elected for five years was the highest legislative body (no general elections took place, however), and the \"State Council\" performed the duties of a senate. The government with eight ministries was the executive body.\n\nThe Slovak Republic was an authoritarian state where the German pressure resulted in the adoption of many elements of German [[Nazism]]. Some historians characterized the Slovak regime from 1939 to 1945 as [[Clerical Fascism|clerical fascism]]. The government issued a number of [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] laws, prohibiting the [[Jews]] from participation in public life, and later supported their deportation to [[concentration camp]]s erected by Germany on Polish territory. The only political parties permitted were the dominant [[Hlinka's Slovak People's Party]] and two smaller openly fascist parties, these being the [[Hungarian National Party (Czechoslovakia)|Hungarian National Party]] which represented the Hungarian minority and the [[German Party (Slovakia)|German Party]] which represented the [[Carpathian Germans|German minority]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:Slovak Republic 1939 45 Administrative Map.png|thumb|right|The Slovak Republic in 1944]]\nThe Slovak Republic was divided into 6 counties and 58 districts as of 1 January 1940.

The Hlinka's Guard began to attack Jews, and the \"[[Anti-Jewish laws#Slovakia|Jewish Code]]\" was passed in September 1941. Resembling the [[Nuremberg Laws]], the code required Jews to wear a [[Yellow badge|yellow armband]], and banned them from intermarriage and from many jobs. By October 1941, 15,000 Jews were expelled from Bratislava; many were sent to labour camps.\n\nThe Slovak Republic was one of the countries to agree to deport its Jews as part of the Nazi [[Final Solution]]. Originally, the Slovak government tried to make a deal with Germany in October 1941 to deport its Jews as a substitute for providing Slovak workers to help the war effort. After the [[Wannsee Conference]], the Germans agreed to the Slovak proposal, and a deal was reached where the Slovak Republic would pay for each Jew deported, and, in return, Germany promised that the Jews would never return to the republic. The initial terms were for \"20,000 young, strong Jews\", but the Slovak government quickly agreed to a German proposal to deport the entire population for \"evacuation to territories in the East\" meaning to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].<ref name=\"HEART\">{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/nazioccupation/slovakjews.html |publisher=Holocaust Research Project.org |title=The Fate of the Slovak Jews |authors=Branik Ceslav & Carmelo Lisciotto,  H.E.A.R.T |year=2008 |at=Sources: G.

By then, however, some 58,000 Jews had already been deported, mostly to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. Slovak government officials filed complaints against Germany, when it became clear that many of the previously deported Slovak Jews had been gassed in mass executions.<ref name=\"HEART\"/>\n\nJewish deportations resumed on 30 September 1944, when the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] army reached the Slovak border, and the [[Slovak National Uprising]] took place. As a result of these events, Germany decided to occupy all of Slovakia and the country lost its independence. During the German occupation, another 13,500 Jews were deported and 5,000 were imprisoned. Deportations continued until 31 March 1945. In all, German and Slovak authorities deported about 70,000 Jews from Slovakia; about 65,000 of them were murdered or died in concentration camps.

The German troops were gradually pushed out by the [[Red Army]], by [[Romania]]n and by Czechoslovak troops coming from the east. The liberated territories became ''[[de facto]]'' part of Czechoslovakia again.\n\nThe First Slovak Republic ceased to exist ''de facto'' on 4 April 1945 when the Red Army captured Bratislava and occupied all of Slovakia. ''[[De jure]]'' it ceased to exist when the exiled Slovak government capitulated to General [[Walton Walker]] leading the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] of the [[3rd US Army]] on 8 May 1945 in the [[Austria]]n town of [[Kremsm\u00fcnster]]. In summer 1945, the captured former president and members of former government were handed over to Czechoslovak authorities.\n\nSeveral prominent Slovak politicians escaped to [[neutral countries]]. Following his captivity, the deposed president Jozef Tiso authorized the former foreign minister [[Ferdinand \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd]] as his successor. \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd, Tiso's personal secretary Karol Mur\u00edn, and cousin Fra\u0148o Tiso were appointed by ex-president Tiso as the representatives of the Slovak nation, however they failed to create a [[government-in-exile]] as no country recognized them. In the 1950s with fellow Slovak nationalist they established Slovak Action Committee (later Slovak Liberation Committee) which unsuccessfully advocated the restoration of the independent Slovak State and the renewal of war against the Soviet Union. After the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] and the creation of the [[Slovakia|Slovak republic]], the Slovak Liberation Committee proclaimed Tiso's authorization as obsolete.\n\n[[File:50 Slovak Koruna 1944 front Josef Tiso.png|thumb|50 Slovak koruna silver coin on the occasion of the five-year anniversary of Slovak Republic (1939\u20131944) with an effigy of the Slovak president [[Jozef Tiso]]]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Slovakia]]\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia]]\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)]]\n* [[Slovaks in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)]]\n* [[Slovak Soviet Republic]] (1919)\n* [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] (1938\u20131945)\n* [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] (1939\u20131945)\n* [[Military history of Carpathian Ruthenia during World War II]]\n* [[Slovensk\u00e9 vzdu\u0161n\u00e9 zbrane]] \u2013 World War II Slovak Air Force\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1945\u20131948)]]\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948\u20131989)]]\n* [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] (1960\u20131989)\n* [[Slovak Socialist Republic]] (1969\u20131990)\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1989\u20131992)]]\n* [[Czech Republic]] (1993\u2013present)\n* [[Slovakia]] (1993\u2013present)\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n;Sources\n*{{cite book |last1=De\u00e1k |first1=Istv\u00e1n |authorlink1=Istv\u00e1n De\u00e1k |title=Europe on Trial: The Story of Collaboration, Resistance, and Retribution during World War II |date=2015 |orig-year=2013|publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-8133-4790-5 |ref=harv |language=en}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Hutzelmann |first1=Barbara |editor1-last=Bajohr |editor1-first=Frank |editor2-last=L\u00f6w |editor2-first=Andrea |title=The Holocaust and European Societies: Social Processes and Social Dynamics |date=2016|location=London |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-137-56984-4 |pages=167\u2013185 |language=en |chapter=Slovak Society and the Jews: Attitudes and Patterns of Behaviour |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Kamenec |first1=Ivan|chapter=The Slovak state, 1939\u20131945 |editor1-last=Teich |editor1-first=Mikul\u00e1\u0161 |editor2-last=Kov\u00e1\u010d |editor2-first=Du\u0161an |editor3-last=Brown |editor3-first=Martin D. |title=Slovakia in History |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-1-139-49494-6|language=en|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511780141|ref={{sfnref|Kamenec|2011a}}|pp=175\u2013192}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|First Slovak Republic}}\n* [http://www.upn.gov.sk/obdobie-1939-1945/dokumenty-1939-1945/ Selected laws of the First Slovak Republic, including the constitution (in Slovak)]\n* [http://stanislav.blog.pravda.sk/2011/06/13/international-situation-impetus-as-a-former-of-intrastate-political-structure-a-comparison-of-the-first-and-second-slovak-republics%E2%80%99-political-systems/ A Comparison of the First and Second Slovak Republics\u2019 Political Systems]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list1 =\n{{World War II}}\n{{Czechoslovakia in World War Two}}\n{{Munich Agreement}}\n{{Czechoslovakia timeline}}\n{{Slovakia topics}}\n{{Holocaust Slovakia}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{coord|48|08|N|17|06|E|type:country_source:kolossus-eswiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Slovak Republic (1939-1945)}}\n[[Category:Client states of Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Slovakia during World War II]]\n[[Category:Slovak National Uprising]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Europe]]\n[[Category:Former republics]]\n[[Category:Former Slavic countries]]\n[[Category:1939 in Slovakia]]\n[[Category:1940s in Slovakia]]\n[[Category:Military history of Czechoslovakia during World War II]]\n[[Category:Eastern European theatre of World War II]]\n[[Category:1939 establishments in Czechoslovakia|.]]\n[[Category:1945 disestablishments in Czechoslovakia|.]]\n[[Category:20th century in Slovakia]]\n[[Category:Political history of Czechoslovakia|.1939]]\n[[Category:Axis powers]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Slovak State|the modern Slovak state|Slovakia}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2018}}{{Infobox country\n|native_name = ''Slovensk\u00e1 republika''\n|conventional_long_name = Slovak Republic\n|common_name = Slovakia\n|status = [[Client state]] of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]{{efn|Views differ on Slovakia's relation to Germany.

It was created out of the Slovak part of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] one day before the start of the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]]. The Slovak Republic controlled the majority of the territory of present-day [[Slovakia]] but without its current southern and eastern parts, which had been ceded to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]] in 1938. The Republic bordered Germany and constituent parts of \"[[Gro\u00dfdeutschland]]\": the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the [[General Government]] (the German-occupied remnant of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]) \u2013 along with independent Hungary.\n\nGermany recognized the Slovak State, as did several other states, including [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Estonia]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Lithuania]], [[Manchukuo]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[Vatican City]]. The majority of the [[Allies of World War II]] never recognized the existence of the Slovak Republic. The Soviet Union [[Czech Republic\u2013Russia relations#History|nullified its recognition]] after Slovakia joined [[Operation Barbarossa|the invasion of the USSR in 1941]].\n\n==Name==\nThe official name of the country was the Slovak State (Slovak: ''Slovensk\u00fd \u0161t\u00e1t'') from 14 March to 21 July 1939 (until the adoption of the [[Constitution of Slovakia (1939)|Constitution]]), and the Slovak Republic (Slovak: ''Slovensk\u00e1 republika'') from 21 July 1939 to its end in April 1945. The country is often referred to historically as the ''First Slovak Republic'' (Slovak: ''prv\u00e1 Slovensk\u00e1 republika'') to distinguish it from the contemporary (Second) [[Slovak Republic]], Slovakia, which is not considered its legal [[Succession of states|successor state]].

As the Nazi F\u00fchrer [[Adolf Hitler]] was preparing a mobilisation into Czech territory and creation of his [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], he had various plans for Slovakia. German officials were initially misinformed by the Hungarians that the Slovaks wanted to join Hungary. Germany decided to make Slovakia a separate puppet state under the influence of Germany, and a potential strategic base for German attacks on [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and other regions.\n\nOn 13 March 1939, Hitler invited [[Monsignor]] [[Jozef Tiso]] (the Slovak ex-[[prime minister]] who had been deposed by Czechoslovak troops several days earlier) to [[Berlin]] and urged him to proclaim Slovakia's independence. Hitler added that, if Tiso did not consent, he would have no interest in Slovakia's fate and would leave it to the territorial claims of Hungary and Poland. During the meeting, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] passed on a report claiming that Hungarian troops were approaching the Slovak borders. Tiso refused to make such a decision himself, after which he was allowed by Hitler to organise a meeting of the Slovak parliament (\"Diet of the Slovak Land\") which would approve Slovakia's independence.\n\nOn 14 March, the Slovak parliament convened and heard Tiso's report on his discussion with Hitler as well as on a possible declaration of independence. Some of the deputies were skeptical of making such a move, among other reasons due to the fact that some worried that the Slovak state would be too small and with a strong [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Hungarian minority]].<ref name=\"RadioPrague\">{{cite web |author=Dominik J\u016fn interviewing Professor Jan Rychl\u00edk |title=Czechs and Slovaks - more than just neighbours |publisher=Radio Prague |year=2016 |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/special/czechs-and-slovaks-more-than-just-neighbours |accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> The debate was quickly brought to a head when [[Franz Karmasin]], leader of the [[Germans in Slovakia|German minority]] in Slovakia, said that any delay in declaring independence would result in Slovakia being divided between Hungary and Germany.

With the impending German invasion of Poland planned for September 1939, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (OKW) requested the assistance of Slovakia. Although the Slovak military was only six months old, it formed a small mobile [[Field Army Bernol\u00e1k|combat group]] consisting of a number of infantry and artillery battalions. Two combat groups were created for the campaign in Poland for use alongside the Germans. The first group was a brigade-sized formation that consisted of six infantry battalions, two artillery battalions, and a company of [[combat engineer]]s, all commanded by Anton\u00edn Pulanich. The second group was a mobile formation that consisted of two battalions of combined cavalry and motorcycle recon troops along with nine motorised artillery batteries, all commanded by Gustav Mal\u00e1r. The two groups reported to the headquarters of the [[1st Infantry Division (Slovak Republic)|1st]] and 3rd Slovak Infantry Divisions. The two combat groups fought while pushing through the [[Nowy S\u0105cz]] and [[Dukla Pass|Dukla Mountain Passes]], advancing towards [[D\u0119bica]] and [[Tarn\u00f3w]] in the region of southern Poland.\n\n===Slovak forces during the campaign against the Soviet Union===\n[[File:Slovak soldiers force Red Army soldiers to surrender.png|thumb|Slovak soldiers force Red Army soldiers to surrender]]\nThe Slovak military participated in the war on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] against the Soviet Union. The Slovak Expeditionary Army Group of about 45,000 entered the Soviet Union shortly after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack]]. This army lacked logistic and transportation support, so a much smaller unit, the Slovak Mobile Command (Pilfousek Brigade), was formed from units selected from this force; the rest of the Slovak army was relegated to rear-area security duty. The Slovak Mobile Command was attached to the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 17th Army]] (as was the Hungarian [[Gyorshadtest|Carpathian Group]] also) and shortly thereafter given over to direct German command, the Slovaks lacking the command infrastructure to exercise effective operational control. This unit fought with the 17th Army through July 1941, including at the [[Battle of Uman]].<ref name=Felgrau>{{cite web |url=http://www.feldgrau.com/a-slovakia.html |title=Slovak Axis Forces in WWII |author=Jason Pipes |work=Feldgrau |accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of August 1941, the Slovak Mobile Command was dissolved and instead two infantry divisions were formed from the Slovak Expeditionary Army Group. The Slovak 2nd Division was a [[Security Division (Wehrmacht)|security division]], but the Slovak 1st Division was a front-line unit which fought in the campaigns of 1941 and 1942, reaching the [[Battle of the Caucasus|Caucasus area]] with [[Army Group B]]. The Slovak 1st Division then shared the fate of the German southern forces, losing their heavy equipment in the [[Kuban bridgehead]], then being badly mangled near [[Melitopol]] in southern Ukraine. In June 1944, the remnant of the division, no longer considered fit for combat due to low morale, was disarmed and the personnel assigned to construction work, a fate which had already befallen the Slovak 2nd Division earlier for the same reason.<ref name=Felgrau/>\n\n===Slovak National Uprising===\n{{Main|Slovak National Uprising}}\n[[File:Karte Slowakischer Nationalaufstand 1944 - Aufstandsbeginn.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Situation map in first days of Slovak National Uprising]]\nIn the 1944 [[Slovak National Uprising]], many Slovak units sided with the Slovak resistance and rebelled against Tiso's collaborationist government, while others helped German forces put the uprising down.\n\n==International relations==\n[[File:Ante Paveli\u0107, Karl Murga\u0161 and Mladen Lorkovi\u0107.jpg|thumb|Slovak Ambassador to [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]], Karel Murga\u0161 (in the middle) with Croatian ''[[Poglavnik]]'' [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] and Foreign Minister [[Mladen Lorkovi\u0107]]]]\n\nFrom the beginning, the Slovak Republic was under the influence of Germany.

The government with eight ministries was the executive body.\n\nThe Slovak Republic was an authoritarian state where the German pressure resulted in the adoption of many elements of German [[Nazism]]. Some historians characterized the Slovak regime from 1939 to 1945 as [[Clerical Fascism|clerical fascism]]. The government issued a number of [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] laws, prohibiting the [[Jews]] from participation in public life, and later supported their deportation to [[concentration camp]]s erected by Germany on Polish territory. The only political parties permitted were the dominant [[Hlinka's Slovak People's Party]] and two smaller openly fascist parties, these being the [[Hungarian National Party (Czechoslovakia)|Hungarian National Party]] which represented the Hungarian minority and the [[German Party (Slovakia)|German Party]] which represented the [[Carpathian Germans|German minority]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:Slovak Republic 1939 45 Administrative Map.png|thumb|right|The Slovak Republic in 1944]]\nThe Slovak Republic was divided into 6 counties and 58 districts as of 1 January 1940.

The Hlinka's Guard began to attack Jews, and the \"[[Anti-Jewish laws#Slovakia|Jewish Code]]\" was passed in September 1941. Resembling the [[Nuremberg Laws]], the code required Jews to wear a [[Yellow badge|yellow armband]], and banned them from intermarriage and from many jobs. By October 1941, 15,000 Jews were expelled from Bratislava; many were sent to labour camps.\n\nThe Slovak Republic was one of the countries to agree to deport its Jews as part of the Nazi [[Final Solution]]. Originally, the Slovak government tried to make a deal with Germany in October 1941 to deport its Jews as a substitute for providing Slovak workers to help the war effort. After the [[Wannsee Conference]], the Germans agreed to the Slovak proposal, and a deal was reached where the Slovak Republic would pay for each Jew deported, and, in return, Germany promised that the Jews would never return to the republic. The initial terms were for \"20,000 young, strong Jews\", but the Slovak government quickly agreed to a German proposal to deport the entire population for \"evacuation to territories in the East\" meaning to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].<ref name=\"HEART\">{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/nazioccupation/slovakjews.html |publisher=Holocaust Research Project.org |title=The Fate of the Slovak Jews |authors=Branik Ceslav & Carmelo Lisciotto,  H.E.A.R.T |year=2008 |at=Sources: G.

By then, however, some 58,000 Jews had already been deported, mostly to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. Slovak government officials filed complaints against Germany, when it became clear that many of the previously deported Slovak Jews had been gassed in mass executions.<ref name=\"HEART\"/>\n\nJewish deportations resumed on 30 September 1944, when the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] army reached the Slovak border, and the [[Slovak National Uprising]] took place. As a result of these events, Germany decided to occupy all of Slovakia and the country lost its independence. During the German occupation, another 13,500 Jews were deported and 5,000 were imprisoned. Deportations continued until 31 March 1945. In all, German and Slovak authorities deported about 70,000 Jews from Slovakia; about 65,000 of them were murdered or died in concentration camps. The overall figures are inexact, partly because many Jews did not identify themselves, but one 2006 estimate is that approximately 105,000 Slovak Jews, or 77% of their pre-war population, died during the war.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rebekah Klein-Pej\u0161ov\u00e1|title=An overview of the history of Jews in Slovakia|work=Slovak Jewish Heritage|publisher=Synagoga Slovaca|year=2006|url=http://www.slovak-jewish-heritage.org/history-of-jews-in-slovakia.php|accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref>\n\n==SS plans for Slovakia==\nAlthough the official policy of the Nazi regime was in favour of an independent Slovak state dependent on Germany and opposed to any annexations of Slovak territory, [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s [[SS]] considered ambitious population policy options concerning the [[Carpathian Germans|German minority of Slovakia]], which numbered circa 130,000 people.<ref name=\"Longerich\">Longerich, P.

The German troops were gradually pushed out by the [[Red Army]], by [[Romania]]n and by Czechoslovak troops coming from the east. The liberated territories became ''[[de facto]]'' part of Czechoslovakia again.\n\nThe First Slovak Republic ceased to exist ''de facto'' on 4 April 1945 when the Red Army captured Bratislava and occupied all of Slovakia. ''[[De jure]]'' it ceased to exist when the exiled Slovak government capitulated to General [[Walton Walker]] leading the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] of the [[3rd US Army]] on 8 May 1945 in the [[Austria]]n town of [[Kremsm\u00fcnster]]. In summer 1945, the captured former president and members of former government were handed over to Czechoslovak authorities.\n\nSeveral prominent Slovak politicians escaped to [[neutral countries]]. Following his captivity, the deposed president Jozef Tiso authorized the former foreign minister [[Ferdinand \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd]] as his successor. \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd, Tiso's personal secretary Karol Mur\u00edn, and cousin Fra\u0148o Tiso were appointed by ex-president Tiso as the representatives of the Slovak nation, however they failed to create a [[government-in-exile]] as no country recognized them. In the 1950s with fellow Slovak nationalist they established Slovak Action Committee (later Slovak Liberation Committee) which unsuccessfully advocated the restoration of the independent Slovak State and the renewal of war against the Soviet Union. After the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] and the creation of the [[Slovakia|Slovak republic]], the Slovak Liberation Committee proclaimed Tiso's authorization as obsolete.\n\n[[File:50 Slovak Koruna 1944 front Josef Tiso.png|thumb|50 Slovak koruna silver coin on the occasion of the five-year anniversary of Slovak Republic (1939\u20131944) with an effigy of the Slovak president [[Jozef Tiso]]]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Slovakia]]\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia]]\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)]]\n* [[Slovaks in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)]]\n* [[Slovak Soviet Republic]] (1919)\n* [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] (1938\u20131945)\n* [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] (1939\u20131945)\n* [[Military history of Carpathian Ruthenia during World War II]]\n* [[Slovensk\u00e9 vzdu\u0161n\u00e9 zbrane]] \u2013 World War II Slovak Air Force\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1945\u20131948)]]\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948\u20131989)]]\n* [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] (1960\u20131989)\n* [[Slovak Socialist Republic]] (1969\u20131990)\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1989\u20131992)]]\n* [[Czech Republic]] (1993\u2013present)\n* [[Slovakia]] (1993\u2013present)\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n;Sources\n*{{cite book |last1=De\u00e1k |first1=Istv\u00e1n |authorlink1=Istv\u00e1n De\u00e1k |title=Europe on Trial: The Story of Collaboration, Resistance, and Retribution during World War II |date=2015 |orig-year=2013|publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-8133-4790-5 |ref=harv |language=en}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Hutzelmann |first1=Barbara |editor1-last=Bajohr |editor1-first=Frank |editor2-last=L\u00f6w |editor2-first=Andrea |title=The Holocaust and European Societies: Social Processes and Social Dynamics |date=2016|location=London |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-137-56984-4 |pages=167\u2013185 |language=en |chapter=Slovak Society and the Jews: Attitudes and Patterns of Behaviour |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Kamenec |first1=Ivan|chapter=The Slovak state, 1939\u20131945 |editor1-last=Teich |editor1-first=Mikul\u00e1\u0161 |editor2-last=Kov\u00e1\u010d |editor2-first=Du\u0161an |editor3-last=Brown |editor3-first=Martin D. |title=Slovakia in History |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-1-139-49494-6|language=en|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511780141|ref={{sfnref|Kamenec|2011a}}|pp=175\u2013192}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|First Slovak Republic}}\n* [http://www.upn.gov.sk/obdobie-1939-1945/dokumenty-1939-1945/ Selected laws of the First Slovak Republic, including the constitution (in Slovak)]\n* [http://stanislav.blog.pravda.sk/2011/06/13/international-situation-impetus-as-a-former-of-intrastate-political-structure-a-comparison-of-the-first-and-second-slovak-republics%E2%80%99-political-systems/ A Comparison of the First and Second Slovak Republics\u2019 Political Systems]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list1 =\n{{World War II}}\n{{Czechoslovakia in World War Two}}\n{{Munich Agreement}}\n{{Czechoslovakia timeline}}\n{{Slovakia topics}}\n{{Holocaust Slovakia}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{coord|48|08|N|17|06|E|type:country_source:kolossus-eswiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Slovak Republic (1939-1945)}}\n[[Category:Client states of Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Slovakia during World War II]]\n[[Category:Slovak National Uprising]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Europe]]\n[[Category:Former republics]]\n[[Category:Former Slavic countries]]\n[[Category:1939 in Slovakia]]\n[[Category:1940s in Slovakia]]\n[[Category:Military history of Czechoslovakia during World War II]]\n[[Category:Eastern European theatre of World War II]]\n[[Category:1939 establishments in Czechoslovakia|.]]\n[[Category:1945 disestablishments in Czechoslovakia|.]]\n[[Category:20th century in Slovakia]]\n[[Category:Political history of Czechoslovakia|.1939]]\n[[Category:Axis powers]]\n", "name_user": "Havsj\u00f6", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_Republic_(1939%E2%80%931945)"}

Fewer leaves to intercept rain will also cause more rain to reach the soil surface, and with fewer plants to absorb the water, the amount of water content in the soils might increase.

Of these adaptations, one of the best-known is likely ''[[serotiny|pyriscence]]'', where maturation and release of seeds is triggered, in whole or in part, by fire or smoke; this behaviour is often erroneously called ''serotiny'', although this term truly denotes the much broader category of seed release activated by any stimulus.  All pyriscent plants are serotinous, but not all serotinous plants are pyriscent (some are necriscent, hygriscent, xeriscent, soliscent, or some combination thereof).  On the other hand, [[germination]] of seed activated by trigger is not to be confused with pyriscence; it is known as ''physiological dormancy''.\n\nIn [[chaparral]] communities in Southern [[California]], for example, some plants have leaves coated in flammable oils that encourage an intense fire.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nps.gov/fire/wildland-fire/learning-center/fire-in-depth/different-ecosystems/chaparral-sw.cfm |title = Fire (U.S. National Park Service)}}</ref> This heat causes their fire-activated seeds to germinate (an example of dormancy) and the young plants can then capitalize on the lack of [[competition (biology)|competition]] in a burnt landscape. Other plants have smoke-activated seeds, or fire-activated buds. The cones of the [[Lodgepole pine]] (''Pinus contorta'') are, conversely, pyriscent: they are sealed with a resin that a fire melts away, releasing the seeds.<ref name=\"USDAFS\">USDA Forest Service</ref> Many plant species, including the shade-intolerant [[giant sequoia]] (''Sequoiadendron giganteum''), require fire to make gaps in the vegetation canopy that will let in light, allowing their seedlings to compete with the more shade-tolerant seedlings of other species, and so establish themselves.<ref name=\"USNPS\">US National Park Service</ref> Because their stationary nature precludes any fire avoidance, plant species may only be fire-intolerant, fire-tolerant or fire-resistant.<ref name=\"Kramp1986\">Kramp ''et al.'' 1986</ref>\n\n====Fire intolerance====\nFire-intolerant plant species tend to be highly flammable and are destroyed completely by fire. Some of these plants and their seeds may simply fade from the community after a fire and not return; others have adapted to ensure that their offspring survives into the next generation. \"Obligate seeders\" are plants with large, fire-activated seed banks that germinate, grow, and mature rapidly following a fire, in order to reproduce and renew the seed bank before the next fire.<ref name=\"Kramp1986\"/><ref name=\"KnoxClarke2005\">Knox and Clarke 2005</ref>\nSeeds may contain the receptor protein KAI2, that is activated by the growth hormones [[karrikin]] released by the fire.<ref name=\"Salk\">{{cite web | url=http://www.salk.edu/news/pressrelease_details.php?press_id=613 | title=Smoke signals: How burning plants tell seeds to rise from the ashes | publisher=Salk Institute for Biological Studies | work=Salik researchers | date=April 29, 2013 | accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>\n[[Image:Eucalypt trees, Australia, 15 months after a bushfire.jpg|right|thumb|Fire tolerance. Typical regrowth after an Australian bushfire]]\n\n====Fire tolerance====\nFire-tolerant species are able to withstand a degree of burning and continue growing despite damage from fire. These plants are sometimes referred to as \"[[resprouter]]s.\" Ecologists have shown that some species of resprouters store extra energy in their roots to aid recovery and re-growth following a fire.<ref name=\"Kramp1986\"/><ref name=\"KnoxClarke2005\"/> For example, after an [[Bushfires in Australia|Australian bushfire]], the [[Mountain Grey Gum]] tree (''Eucalyptus cypellocarpa'') starts producing a mass of shoots of leaves from the base of the tree all the way up the trunk towards the top, making it look like a black stick completely covered with young, green leaves.\n\n====Fire resistance====\nFire-resistant plants suffer little damage during a characteristic fire regime. These include large trees whose flammable parts are high above surface fires. Mature [[ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa'') is an example of a tree species that suffers virtually no crown damage under a naturally mild fire regime, because it sheds its lower, vulnerable branches as it matures.<ref name=\"Kramp1986\"/><ref name=\"Pyne2002\">Pyne 2002</ref>\n\n===Animals, birds and microbes===\n[[Image:Fire hawks.jpg|right|thumb|A mixed flock of hawks hunting in and around a bushfire]]\nLike plants, animals display a range of abilities to cope with fire, but they differ from most plants in that they must avoid the actual fire to survive. Although [[bird]]s are vulnerable when nesting, they are generally able to escape a fire; indeed they often profit from being able to take prey fleeing from a fire and to recolonize burned areas quickly afterwards. Some anthropological and ethno-ornithological evidence suggests that certain species of fire-foraging raptors may engage in intentional fire propagation to flush out prey.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gosford|first1=Robert|title=Ornithogenic Fire: Raptors as Propagators of Fire in the Australian Savanna|journal=2015 Raptor Research Foundation Annual Conference, Nov 4 \u2013 8 , Sacramento, California|date=Nov 2015|url=http://www.raptorresearchfoundation.org/files/2015/11/2015_conference_program.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bonta|first1=Mark|title=Intentional fire-spreading by \"firehawk\" raptors in Northern Australia|journal= Journal of Ethnobiology|volume=37|issue=4|pages=700\u2013718|date=2017|doi=10.2993/0278-0771-37.4.700}}</ref>  [[Mammal]]s are often capable of fleeing a fire, or seeking cover if they can burrow.

One sweeping generality is that in all ecosystems, fire creates a mosaic of different [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] patches, with areas ranging from those having just been burned to those that have been untouched by fire for many years. This is a form of [[ecological succession]] in which a freshly burned site will progress through continuous and directional phases of colonization following the destruction caused by the fire.<ref name=\"Begon1996p692\">Begon ''et al.'' 1996, pg. 692</ref>  Ecologists usually characterize succession through the changes in vegetation that successively arise. After a fire, the first species to re-colonize will be those with seeds are already present in the soil, or those with seeds are able to travel into the burned area quickly. These are generally fast-growing [[herbaceous]] plants that require light and are intolerant of shading. As time passes, more slowly growing, shade-tolerant woody species will suppress some of the herbaceous plants.<ref name=\"Begon1996p700\">Begon ''et al.'' 1996, pg 700</ref> Conifers are often early successional species, while broad leaf trees frequently replace them in the absence of fire. Hence, many conifer forests are themselves dependent upon recurring fire.<ref name=\"Keddy 2007\">Keddy 2007, Chapter 6</ref>\n\nDifferent species of plants, animals, and microbes specialize in exploiting different stages in this process of succession, and by creating these different types of patches, fire allows a greater number of species to exist within a landscape. Soil characteristics will be a factor in determining the specific nature of a fire-adapted ecosystem, as will climate and topography.\n\n==Examples of fire in different ecosystems==\n\n===Forests===\nMild to moderate fires burn in the [[forest]] [[understory]], removing small trees and herbaceous [[groundcover]]. High-severity fires will burn into the crowns of the trees and kill most of the dominant vegetation. Crown fires may require support from ground fuels to maintain the fire in the forest canopy (passive crown fires), or the fire may burn in the canopy independently of any ground fuel support (an active crown fire). High-severity fire creates [[complex early seral forest]] habitat, or [[snag forest]] with high levels of biodiversity. When a forest burns frequently and thus has less plant litter build-up, below-ground soil temperatures rise only slightly and will not be lethal to roots that lie deep in the soil.<ref name=\"DeBano1998\"/> Although other characteristics of a forest will influence the impact of fire upon it, factors such as [[climate]] and [[topography]] play an important role in determining fire severity and fire extent.<ref name=\"BeatyTaylor2001\">Beaty and Taylor (2001)</ref> Fires spread most widely during drought years, are most severe on upper slopes and are influenced by the type of vegetation that is growing.\n\n====Forests in British Columbia====\nIn [[Canada]], forests cover about 10% of the land area and yet harbor 70% of the country\u2019s bird and terrestrial mammal species. Natural fire regimes are important in maintaining a diverse assemblage of [[vertebrate]] species in up to twelve different forest types in [[British Columbia]].<ref name=\"Bunnell1995\">Bunnell (1995)</ref> Different species have adapted to exploit the different stages of succession, regrowth and habitat change that occurs following an episode of burning, such as downed trees and debris. The characteristics of the initial fire, such as its size and intensity, cause the habitat to evolve differentially afterwards and influence how vertebrate species are able to use the burned areas.<ref name=\"Bunnell1995\" />\n\n===Shrublands===\n[[File:2011-08-04 20 00 00 Susie Fire in the Adobe Range west of Elko Nevada.jpg|thumb|Lightning-sparked wildfires are frequent occurrences on shrublands and grasslands in [[Nevada]].]]\n[[Shrub]] fires typically concentrate in the canopy and spread continuously if the shrubs are close enough together. [[Shrubland]]s are typically dry and are prone to accumulations of highly volatile fuels, especially on hillsides. Fires will follow the path of least moisture and the greatest amount of dead fuel material. Surface and below-ground soil temperatures during a burn are generally higher than those of forest fires because the centers of combustion lie closer to the ground, although this can vary greatly.<ref name=\"DeBano1998\"/> Common plants in shrubland or chaparral include [[manzanita]], [[Adenostoma fasciculatum|chamise]] and [[Coyote Brush]].\n\n====California shrublands====\nCalifornia shrubland, commonly known as [[chaparral]], is a widespread plant community of low growing species, typically on arid sloping areas of the [[California Coast Ranges]] or western foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. There are a number of common shrubs and tree shrub forms in this association, including [[salal]], [[toyon]], [[Rhamnus californica|coffeeberry]] and [[Western poison oak]].<ref>C.Michael Hogan (2008) [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 \"Western poison-oak: Toxicodendron diversilobum\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721044257/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 |date=July 21, 2009 }}, GlobalTwitcher, ed. Nicklas Str\u00f6mberg</ref> Regeneration following a fire is usually a major factor in the association of these species.\n\n====South African Fynbos shrublands====\n[[Fynbos]] shrublands occur in a small belt across [[South Africa]]. The plant species in this ecosystem are highly diverse, yet the majority of these species are obligate seeders, that is, a fire will cause germination of the seeds and the plants will begin a new life-cycle because of it. These plants may have [[Coevolution|coevolved]] into obligate seeders as a response to fire and nutrient-poor soils.<ref name=\"Wisheu2000\">Wisheu ''et al.'' (2000)</ref> Because fire is common in this ecosystem and the soil has limited nutrients, it is most efficient for plants to produce many seeds and then die in the next fire. Investing a lot of energy in roots to survive the next fire when those roots will be able to extract little extra benefit from the nutrient-poor soil would be less efficient. It is possible that the rapid generation time that these obligate seeders display has led to more rapid [[evolution]] and [[speciation]] in this ecosystem, resulting in its highly diverse plant community.<ref name=\"Wisheu2000\" />\n\n===Grasslands===\n[[Grasslands]] burn more readily than forest and shrub ecosystems, with the fire moving through the stems and leaves of herbaceous plants and only lightly heating the underlying soil, even in cases of high intensity. In most grassland ecosystems, fire is the primary mode of [[decomposition]], making it crucial in the [[nutrient cycle|recycling of nutrients]].<ref name=\"DeBano1998\"/> In some grassland systems, fire only became the primary mode of decomposition after the disappearance of large migratory herds of browsing or grazing megafauna driven by predator pressure. In the absence of functional communities of large migratory herds of herbivorous megafauna and attendant predators, overuse of fire to maintain grassland ecosystems may lead to excessive oxidation, loss of carbon, and desertification in susceptible climates.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Holistic management : a commonsense revolution to restore our environment |last1=Savory|first1=Allan|last2=Butterfield|first2=Jody|isbn=9781610917438|edition=Third|location=Washington|oclc=961894493|date = 2016-11-10}}</ref> Some grassland ecosystems respond poorly to fire.<ref name=\"USFS\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/4554|title=Wildland fire in ecosystems: effects of fire on flora|last=Brown|first=James K.|author2=Smith, Jane Kapler|year=2000|work=Gen.

Fire plays an important role in nutrient cycling, diversity maintenance and habitat structure. The suppression of fire can lead to unforeseen changes in ecosystems that often adversely affect the plants, animals and humans that depend upon that habitat. Wildfires that deviate from a historical fire regime because of fire suppression are called \"uncharacteristic fires\".\n\n===Chaparral communities===\nIn 2003, southern [[California]] witnessed powerful [[chaparral]] wildfires. Hundreds of homes and hundreds of thousands of acres of land went up in flames. Extreme fire weather (low humidity, low fuel moisture and high winds) and the accumulation of dead plant material from 8 years of drought, contributed to a catastrophic outcome. Although some have maintained that fire suppression contributed to an unnatural buildup of fuel loads,<ref name=\"Minnich1983\">Minnich 1983</ref> a detailed analysis of historical fire data has showed that this may not have been the case.<ref name=\"Keeley1999\">Keeley ''et al.'' 1999</ref> Fire suppression activities had failed to exclude fire from the southern California chaparral. Research showing differences in fire size and frequency between southern California and Baja has been used to imply that the larger fires north of the border are the result of fire suppression, but this opinion has been challenged by numerous investigators and is no longer supported by the majority of fire ecologists.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nOne consequence of the fires in 2003 has been the increased density of [[invasive species|invasive]] and [[introduced species|non-native]] plant species that have quickly colonized burned areas, especially those that had already been burned in the previous 15 years. Because shrubs in these communities are adapted to a particular historical fire regime, altered fire regimes may change the [[selective pressure]]s on plants and favor invasive and non-native species that are better able to exploit the novel post-fire conditions.<ref name=\"Keeley2005\">Keeley ''et al.'' 2005</ref>\n\n===Fish impacts===\nThe [[Boise National Forest]] is a US national forest located north and east of the city of [[Boise, Idaho]]. Following several uncharacteristically large wildfires, an immediately negative impact on fish populations was observed, posing particular danger to small and isolated fish populations.<ref name=\"Burton2005\">Burton (2005)</ref> In the long term, however, fire appears to rejuvenate fish habitats by causing [[hydraulic]] changes that increase flooding and lead to [[silt]] removal and the deposition of a favorable habitat substrate. This leads to larger post-fire populations of the fish that are able to recolonize these improved areas.<ref name=\"Burton2005\" /> But although fire generally appears favorable for fish populations in these ecosystems, the more intense effects of uncharacteristic wildfires, in combination with the fragmentation of populations by human barriers to dispersal such as weirs and dams, ''will'' pose a threat to fish populations.\n\n==Fire as a management tool==\n[[File:Prescribed Burn in Oak Savannah in Iowa.jpg|thumb|Prescribed Burn in Oak Savannah in Iowa]]\n[[Restoration ecology]] is the name given to an attempt to reverse or mitigate some of the changes that humans have caused to an ecosystem. [[Controlled burn]]ing is one tool that is currently receiving considerable attention as a means of restoration and management. Applying fire to an ecosystem may create habitats for species that have been negatively impacted by fire suppression, or fire may be used as a way of controlling invasive species without resorting to herbicides or pesticides. However, there is debate as to what state managers should aim to restore their ecosystems to, especially as to whether \"natural\" means pre-human or pre-European. [[Native American use of fire]], not natural fires, historically maintained the diversity of the [[Pre-Columbian savannas of North America|savannas of North America]].<ref>MacDougall ''et al.''

In semi-arid ecosystems where the decomposition of woody material is slow, fire is crucial for returning nutrients to the soil and allowing the grasslands to maintain their high productivity.\n\nAlthough fire can occur during the growing or the dormant seasons, managed fire during the dormant season is most effective at increasing the grass and [[forb]] cover, [[biodiversity]] and plant nutrient uptake in shortgrass prairies.<ref name=\"Brockwayet\">Brockway et al. 2002</ref> Managers must also take into account, however, how invasive and non-native species respond to fire if they want to restore the integrity of a native ecosystem. For example, fire can only control the invasive [[spotted knapweed]] (''Centaurea maculosa'') on the Michigan tallgrass prairie in the summer, because this is the time in the knapweed's life cycle that is most important to its reproductive growth.<ref>Emery and Gross (2005)</ref>\n\n===Mixed conifer forests in the US Sierra Nevada===\nMixed [[conifer]] forests in the United States [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] used to have fire return intervals that ranged from 5 years up to 300 years, depending on the local climate. Lower elevations had more frequent fire return intervals, whilst higher and wetter elevations saw much longer intervals between fires. Native Americans tended to set fires during fall and winter, and land at a higher elevation was generally occupied by Native Americans only during the summer.<ref name=\"Anderson1996\">{{Cite book|last=Ramzan|first=Muhammad|url=https://biologyteach.com/fire-as-a-ecological-factor-fire-ecology/|title=Fire as a Ecological Factor  [Fire Ecology1]|year=2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Finnish boreal forests ===\nThe decline of habitat area and quality has caused many species populations to be red-listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. According to a study on forest management of Finnish boreal forests, improving the habitat quality of areas outside reserves can help in conservation efforts of endangered deadwood-dependent beetles. These beetles and various types of fungi both need dead trees in order to survive. Old growth forests can provide this particular habitat. However, most Fennoscandian boreal forested areas are used for timber and therefore are unprotected. The use of controlled burning and tree retention of a forested area with deadwood was studied and its effect on the endangered beetles. The study found that after the first year of management the number of species increased in abundance and richness compared to pre-fire treatment. The abundance of beetles continued to increase the following year in sites where tree retention was high and deadwood was abundant. The correlation between forest fire management and increased beetle populations shows a key to conserving these red-listed species.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hyvarinen|first1=Esko|last2=Kouki|first2=Jari|last3=Martikainen|first3=Petri|title=Fire and Green-Tree Retention in Conservation of Red-Listed and Rare Deadwood-Dependent Beetles in Finnish Boreal Forests|journal=Conservation Biology|date=1 February 2006|volume=20|issue=6|pages=1711\u20131719|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00511.x|pmid=17181806}}</ref>\n\n===Australian eucalypt forests===\nMuch of the old growth [[Eucalyptus|eucalypt]] forest in Australia is designated for conservation. Management of these forests is important because species like ''Eucalyptus grandis'' rely on fire to survive. There are a few eucalypt species that do not have a [[lignotuber]], a root swelling structure that contains buds where new shoots can then sprout. During a fire a lignotuber is helpful in the reestablishment of the plant. Because some eucalypts do not have this particular mechanism, forest fire management can be helpful by creating rich soil, killing competitors, and allowing seeds to be released.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tng|first1=David Y.

The new federal outlook on fire policy parallels advances in ecology and is moving towards the view that many ecosystems depend on disturbance for their diversity and for the proper maintenance of their natural processes. Although human safety is still the number one priority in fire management, new US government objectives include a long-term view of ecosystems. The newest policy allows managers to gauge the relative values of private property and resources in particular situations and to set their priorities accordingly.<ref name=\"USDAFS\"/>\n\nOne of the primary goals in fire management is to improve public education in order to suppress the \"[[Smokey Bear]]\" fire-suppression mentality and introduce the public to the benefits of regular natural fires.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ecology|Environment}}\n* [[Crown sprouting]]\n* [[Evolutionary history of plants]]\n* [[Peat bog fire]]\n* [[Fire history]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*Archibald, S., W.J.

Ecologists can define this in many ways, but one way is through an estimate of plant mortality. Fire can burn at three levels. Ground fires will burn through soil that is rich in organic matter. Surface fires will burn through dead plant material that is lying on the ground. Crown fires will burn in the tops of shrubs and trees.

Of these adaptations, one of the best-known is likely ''[[serotiny|pyriscence]]'', where maturation and release of seeds is triggered, in whole or in part, by fire or smoke; this behaviour is often erroneously called ''serotiny'', although this term truly denotes the much broader category of seed release activated by any stimulus.  All pyriscent plants are serotinous, but not all serotinous plants are pyriscent (some are necriscent, hygriscent, xeriscent, soliscent, or some combination thereof).  On the other hand, [[germination]] of seed activated by trigger is not to be confused with pyriscence; it is known as ''physiological dormancy''.\n\nIn [[chaparral]] communities in Southern [[California]], for example, some plants have leaves coated in flammable oils that encourage an intense fire.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nps.gov/fire/wildland-fire/learning-center/fire-in-depth/different-ecosystems/chaparral-sw.cfm |title = Fire (U.S. National Park Service)}}</ref> This heat causes their fire-activated seeds to germinate (an example of dormancy) and the young plants can then capitalize on the lack of [[competition (biology)|competition]] in a burnt landscape. Other plants have smoke-activated seeds, or fire-activated buds. The cones of the [[Lodgepole pine]] (''Pinus contorta'') are, conversely, pyriscent: they are sealed with a resin that a fire melts away, releasing the seeds.<ref name=\"USDAFS\">USDA Forest Service</ref> Many plant species, including the shade-intolerant [[giant sequoia]] (''Sequoiadendron giganteum''), require fire to make gaps in the vegetation canopy that will let in light, allowing their seedlings to compete with the more shade-tolerant seedlings of other species, and so establish themselves.<ref name=\"USNPS\">US National Park Service</ref> Because their stationary nature precludes any fire avoidance, plant species may only be fire-intolerant, fire-tolerant or fire-resistant.<ref name=\"Kramp1986\">Kramp ''et al.'' 1986</ref>\n\n====Fire intolerance====\nFire-intolerant plant species tend to be highly flammable and are destroyed completely by fire. Some of these plants and their seeds may simply fade from the community after a fire and not return; others have adapted to ensure that their offspring survives into the next generation. \"Obligate seeders\" are plants with large, fire-activated seed banks that germinate, grow, and mature rapidly following a fire, in order to reproduce and renew the seed bank before the next fire.<ref name=\"Kramp1986\"/><ref name=\"KnoxClarke2005\">Knox and Clarke 2005</ref>\nSeeds may contain the receptor protein KAI2, that is activated by the growth hormones [[karrikin]] released by the fire.<ref name=\"Salk\">{{cite web | url=http://www.salk.edu/news/pressrelease_details.php?press_id=613 | title=Smoke signals: How burning plants tell seeds to rise from the ashes | publisher=Salk Institute for Biological Studies | work=Salik researchers | date=April 29, 2013 | accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>\n[[Image:Eucalypt trees, Australia, 15 months after a bushfire.jpg|right|thumb|Fire tolerance.

These plants are sometimes referred to as \"[[resprouter]]s.\" Ecologists have shown that some species of resprouters store extra energy in their roots to aid recovery and re-growth following a fire.<ref name=\"Kramp1986\"/><ref name=\"KnoxClarke2005\"/> For example, after an [[Bushfires in Australia|Australian bushfire]], the [[Mountain Grey Gum]] tree (''Eucalyptus cypellocarpa'') starts producing a mass of shoots of leaves from the base of the tree all the way up the trunk towards the top, making it look like a black stick completely covered with young, green leaves.\n\n====Fire resistance====\nFire-resistant plants suffer little damage during a characteristic fire regime. These include large trees whose flammable parts are high above surface fires. Mature [[ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa'') is an example of a tree species that suffers virtually no crown damage under a naturally mild fire regime, because it sheds its lower, vulnerable branches as it matures.<ref name=\"Kramp1986\"/><ref name=\"Pyne2002\">Pyne 2002</ref>\n\n===Animals, birds and microbes===\n[[Image:Fire hawks.jpg|right|thumb|A mixed flock of hawks hunting in and around a bushfire]]\nLike plants, animals display a range of abilities to cope with fire, but they differ from most plants in that they must avoid the actual fire to survive. Although [[bird]]s are vulnerable when nesting, they are generally able to escape a fire; indeed they often profit from being able to take prey fleeing from a fire and to recolonize burned areas quickly afterwards. Some anthropological and ethno-ornithological evidence suggests that certain species of fire-foraging raptors may engage in intentional fire propagation to flush out prey.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gosford|first1=Robert|title=Ornithogenic Fire: Raptors as Propagators of Fire in the Australian Savanna|journal=2015 Raptor Research Foundation Annual Conference, Nov 4 \u2013 8 , Sacramento, California|date=Nov 2015|url=http://www.raptorresearchfoundation.org/files/2015/11/2015_conference_program.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bonta|first1=Mark|title=Intentional fire-spreading by \"firehawk\" raptors in Northern Australia|journal= Journal of Ethnobiology|volume=37|issue=4|pages=700\u2013718|date=2017|doi=10.2993/0278-0771-37.4.700}}</ref>  [[Mammal]]s are often capable of fleeing a fire, or seeking cover if they can burrow.

One sweeping generality is that in all ecosystems, fire creates a mosaic of different [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] patches, with areas ranging from those having just been burned to those that have been untouched by fire for many years. This is a form of [[ecological succession]] in which a freshly burned site will progress through continuous and directional phases of colonization following the destruction caused by the fire.<ref name=\"Begon1996p692\">Begon ''et al.'' 1996, pg. 692</ref>  Ecologists usually characterize succession through the changes in vegetation that successively arise. After a fire, the first species to re-colonize will be those with seeds are already present in the soil, or those with seeds are able to travel into the burned area quickly. These are generally fast-growing [[herbaceous]] plants that require light and are intolerant of shading. As time passes, more slowly growing, shade-tolerant woody species will suppress some of the herbaceous plants.<ref name=\"Begon1996p700\">Begon ''et al.'' 1996, pg 700</ref> Conifers are often early successional species, while broad leaf trees frequently replace them in the absence of fire. Hence, many conifer forests are themselves dependent upon recurring fire.<ref name=\"Keddy 2007\">Keddy 2007, Chapter 6</ref>\n\nDifferent species of plants, animals, and microbes specialize in exploiting different stages in this process of succession, and by creating these different types of patches, fire allows a greater number of species to exist within a landscape. Soil characteristics will be a factor in determining the specific nature of a fire-adapted ecosystem, as will climate and topography.\n\n==Examples of fire in different ecosystems==\n\n===Forests===\nMild to moderate fires burn in the [[forest]] [[understory]], removing small trees and herbaceous [[groundcover]]. High-severity fires will burn into the crowns of the trees and kill most of the dominant vegetation. Crown fires may require support from ground fuels to maintain the fire in the forest canopy (passive crown fires), or the fire may burn in the canopy independently of any ground fuel support (an active crown fire). High-severity fire creates [[complex early seral forest]] habitat, or [[snag forest]] with high levels of biodiversity. When a forest burns frequently and thus has less plant litter build-up, below-ground soil temperatures rise only slightly and will not be lethal to roots that lie deep in the soil.<ref name=\"DeBano1998\"/> Although other characteristics of a forest will influence the impact of fire upon it, factors such as [[climate]] and [[topography]] play an important role in determining fire severity and fire extent.<ref name=\"BeatyTaylor2001\">Beaty and Taylor (2001)</ref> Fires spread most widely during drought years, are most severe on upper slopes and are influenced by the type of vegetation that is growing.\n\n====Forests in British Columbia====\nIn [[Canada]], forests cover about 10% of the land area and yet harbor 70% of the country\u2019s bird and terrestrial mammal species. Natural fire regimes are important in maintaining a diverse assemblage of [[vertebrate]] species in up to twelve different forest types in [[British Columbia]].<ref name=\"Bunnell1995\">Bunnell (1995)</ref> Different species have adapted to exploit the different stages of succession, regrowth and habitat change that occurs following an episode of burning, such as downed trees and debris. The characteristics of the initial fire, such as its size and intensity, cause the habitat to evolve differentially afterwards and influence how vertebrate species are able to use the burned areas.<ref name=\"Bunnell1995\" />\n\n===Shrublands===\n[[File:2011-08-04 20 00 00 Susie Fire in the Adobe Range west of Elko Nevada.jpg|thumb|Lightning-sparked wildfires are frequent occurrences on shrublands and grasslands in [[Nevada]].]]\n[[Shrub]] fires typically concentrate in the canopy and spread continuously if the shrubs are close enough together. [[Shrubland]]s are typically dry and are prone to accumulations of highly volatile fuels, especially on hillsides. Fires will follow the path of least moisture and the greatest amount of dead fuel material. Surface and below-ground soil temperatures during a burn are generally higher than those of forest fires because the centers of combustion lie closer to the ground, although this can vary greatly.<ref name=\"DeBano1998\"/> Common plants in shrubland or chaparral include [[manzanita]], [[Adenostoma fasciculatum|chamise]] and [[Coyote Brush]].\n\n====California shrublands====\nCalifornia shrubland, commonly known as [[chaparral]], is a widespread plant community of low growing species, typically on arid sloping areas of the [[California Coast Ranges]] or western foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. There are a number of common shrubs and tree shrub forms in this association, including [[salal]], [[toyon]], [[Rhamnus californica|coffeeberry]] and [[Western poison oak]].<ref>C.Michael Hogan (2008) [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 \"Western poison-oak: Toxicodendron diversilobum\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721044257/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 |date=July 21, 2009 }}, GlobalTwitcher, ed. Nicklas Str\u00f6mberg</ref> Regeneration following a fire is usually a major factor in the association of these species.\n\n====South African Fynbos shrublands====\n[[Fynbos]] shrublands occur in a small belt across [[South Africa]]. The plant species in this ecosystem are highly diverse, yet the majority of these species are obligate seeders, that is, a fire will cause germination of the seeds and the plants will begin a new life-cycle because of it. These plants may have [[Coevolution|coevolved]] into obligate seeders as a response to fire and nutrient-poor soils.<ref name=\"Wisheu2000\">Wisheu ''et al.'' (2000)</ref> Because fire is common in this ecosystem and the soil has limited nutrients, it is most efficient for plants to produce many seeds and then die in the next fire. Investing a lot of energy in roots to survive the next fire when those roots will be able to extract little extra benefit from the nutrient-poor soil would be less efficient. It is possible that the rapid generation time that these obligate seeders display has led to more rapid [[evolution]] and [[speciation]] in this ecosystem, resulting in its highly diverse plant community.<ref name=\"Wisheu2000\" />\n\n===Grasslands===\n[[Grasslands]] burn more readily than forest and shrub ecosystems, with the fire moving through the stems and leaves of herbaceous plants and only lightly heating the underlying soil, even in cases of high intensity. In most grassland ecosystems, fire is the primary mode of [[decomposition]], making it crucial in the [[nutrient cycle|recycling of nutrients]].<ref name=\"DeBano1998\"/> In some grassland systems, fire only became the primary mode of decomposition after the disappearance of large migratory herds of browsing or grazing megafauna driven by predator pressure. In the absence of functional communities of large migratory herds of herbivorous megafauna and attendant predators, overuse of fire to maintain grassland ecosystems may lead to excessive oxidation, loss of carbon, and desertification in susceptible climates.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Holistic management : a commonsense revolution to restore our environment |last1=Savory|first1=Allan|last2=Butterfield|first2=Jody|isbn=9781610917438|edition=Third|location=Washington|oclc=961894493|date = 2016-11-10}}</ref> Some grassland ecosystems respond poorly to fire.<ref name=\"USFS\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/4554|title=Wildland fire in ecosystems: effects of fire on flora|last=Brown|first=James K.|author2=Smith, Jane Kapler|year=2000|work=Gen.

In the [[Florida Everglades]], a significant portion of the DOC is \"dissolved charcoal\" indicating that fire can play a critical role in wetland ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=127577 |title=Where Does Charcoal, or Black Carbon, in Soils Go? |series=News Release 13-069 |date=2013-04-13 |publisher=National Science Foundation |access-date=2019-01-09 |quote=Surprised by the finding, the researchers shifted their focus to the origin of the dissolved charcoal.}}</ref>\n\n==Fire suppression==\n{{Main|Wildfire suppression}}\nFire serves many important functions within fire-adapted ecosystems. Fire plays an important role in nutrient cycling, diversity maintenance and habitat structure. The suppression of fire can lead to unforeseen changes in ecosystems that often adversely affect the plants, animals and humans that depend upon that habitat. Wildfires that deviate from a historical fire regime because of fire suppression are called \"uncharacteristic fires\".\n\n===Chaparral communities===\nIn 2003, southern [[California]] witnessed powerful [[chaparral]] wildfires. Hundreds of homes and hundreds of thousands of acres of land went up in flames. Extreme fire weather (low humidity, low fuel moisture and high winds) and the accumulation of dead plant material from 8 years of drought, contributed to a catastrophic outcome. Although some have maintained that fire suppression contributed to an unnatural buildup of fuel loads,<ref name=\"Minnich1983\">Minnich 1983</ref> a detailed analysis of historical fire data has showed that this may not have been the case.<ref name=\"Keeley1999\">Keeley ''et al.'' 1999</ref> Fire suppression activities had failed to exclude fire from the southern California chaparral. Research showing differences in fire size and frequency between southern California and Baja has been used to imply that the larger fires north of the border are the result of fire suppression, but this opinion has been challenged by numerous investigators and is no longer supported by the majority of fire ecologists.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nOne consequence of the fires in 2003 has been the increased density of [[invasive species|invasive]] and [[introduced species|non-native]] plant species that have quickly colonized burned areas, especially those that had already been burned in the previous 15 years. Because shrubs in these communities are adapted to a particular historical fire regime, altered fire regimes may change the [[selective pressure]]s on plants and favor invasive and non-native species that are better able to exploit the novel post-fire conditions.<ref name=\"Keeley2005\">Keeley ''et al.'' 2005</ref>\n\n===Fish impacts===\nThe [[Boise National Forest]] is a US national forest located north and east of the city of [[Boise, Idaho]]. Following several uncharacteristically large wildfires, an immediately negative impact on fish populations was observed, posing particular danger to small and isolated fish populations.<ref name=\"Burton2005\">Burton (2005)</ref> In the long term, however, fire appears to rejuvenate fish habitats by causing [[hydraulic]] changes that increase flooding and lead to [[silt]] removal and the deposition of a favorable habitat substrate. This leads to larger post-fire populations of the fish that are able to recolonize these improved areas.<ref name=\"Burton2005\" /> But although fire generally appears favorable for fish populations in these ecosystems, the more intense effects of uncharacteristic wildfires, in combination with the fragmentation of populations by human barriers to dispersal such as weirs and dams, ''will'' pose a threat to fish populations.\n\n==Fire as a management tool==\n[[File:Prescribed Burn in Oak Savannah in Iowa.jpg|thumb|Prescribed Burn in Oak Savannah in Iowa]]\n[[Restoration ecology]] is the name given to an attempt to reverse or mitigate some of the changes that humans have caused to an ecosystem. [[Controlled burn]]ing is one tool that is currently receiving considerable attention as a means of restoration and management. Applying fire to an ecosystem may create habitats for species that have been negatively impacted by fire suppression, or fire may be used as a way of controlling invasive species without resorting to herbicides or pesticides. However, there is debate as to what state managers should aim to restore their ecosystems to, especially as to whether \"natural\" means pre-human or pre-European. [[Native American use of fire]], not natural fires, historically maintained the diversity of the [[Pre-Columbian savannas of North America|savannas of North America]].<ref>MacDougall ''et al.'' (2004)</ref><ref name=\"Williams2003\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/heritage/docum/Fire/Bibliography%20-%20Indian%20Use%20of%20Fire.pdf|title=REFERENCES ON THE AMERICAN INDIAN USE OF FIRE IN ECOSYSTEMS|last=Williams|first=Gerald W.|date=2003-06-12|accessdate=2008-07-31|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706160607/http://www.blm.gov/heritage/docum/Fire/Bibliography%20-%20Indian%20Use%20of%20Fire.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-06}}</ref> When, how, and where managers should use fire as a management tool is a subject of debate.\n\n===The Great Plains shortgrass prairie===\n{{details|Shortgrass prairie}}\nA combination of heavy livestock grazing and fire-suppression has drastically altered the structure, composition, and diversity of the shortgrass prairie ecosystem on the [[Great Plains]], allowing woody species to dominate many areas and promoting fire-intolerant invasive species. In semi-arid ecosystems where the decomposition of woody material is slow, fire is crucial for returning nutrients to the soil and allowing the grasslands to maintain their high productivity.\n\nAlthough fire can occur during the growing or the dormant seasons, managed fire during the dormant season is most effective at increasing the grass and [[forb]] cover, [[biodiversity]] and plant nutrient uptake in shortgrass prairies.<ref name=\"Brockwayet\">Brockway et al. 2002</ref> Managers must also take into account, however, how invasive and non-native species respond to fire if they want to restore the integrity of a native ecosystem. For example, fire can only control the invasive [[spotted knapweed]] (''Centaurea maculosa'') on the Michigan tallgrass prairie in the summer, because this is the time in the knapweed's life cycle that is most important to its reproductive growth.<ref>Emery and Gross (2005)</ref>\n\n===Mixed conifer forests in the US Sierra Nevada===\nMixed [[conifer]] forests in the United States [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] used to have fire return intervals that ranged from 5 years up to 300 years, depending on the local climate. Lower elevations had more frequent fire return intervals, whilst higher and wetter elevations saw much longer intervals between fires. Native Americans tended to set fires during fall and winter, and land at a higher elevation was generally occupied by Native Americans only during the summer.<ref name=\"Anderson1996\">{{Cite book|last=ANDERSON|first=M.

According to a study on forest management of Finnish boreal forests, improving the habitat quality of areas outside reserves can help in conservation efforts of endangered deadwood-dependent beetles. These beetles and various types of fungi both need dead trees in order to survive. Old growth forests can provide this particular habitat. However, most Fennoscandian boreal forested areas are used for timber and therefore are unprotected. The use of controlled burning and tree retention of a forested area with deadwood was studied and its effect on the endangered beetles. The study found that after the first year of management the number of species increased in abundance and richness compared to pre-fire treatment. The abundance of beetles continued to increase the following year in sites where tree retention was high and deadwood was abundant. The correlation between forest fire management and increased beetle populations shows a key to conserving these red-listed species.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hyvarinen|first1=Esko|last2=Kouki|first2=Jari|last3=Martikainen|first3=Petri|title=Fire and Green-Tree Retention in Conservation of Red-Listed and Rare Deadwood-Dependent Beetles in Finnish Boreal Forests|journal=Conservation Biology|date=1 February 2006|volume=20|issue=6|pages=1711\u20131719|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00511.x|pmid=17181806}}</ref>\n\n===Australian eucalypt forests===\nMuch of the old growth [[Eucalyptus|eucalypt]] forest in Australia is designated for conservation. Management of these forests is important because species like ''Eucalyptus grandis'' rely on fire to survive. There are a few eucalypt species that do not have a [[lignotuber]], a root swelling structure that contains buds where new shoots can then sprout. During a fire a lignotuber is helpful in the reestablishment of the plant. Because some eucalypts do not have this particular mechanism, forest fire management can be helpful by creating rich soil, killing competitors, and allowing seeds to be released.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tng|first1=David Y.

The new federal outlook on fire policy parallels advances in ecology and is moving towards the view that many ecosystems depend on disturbance for their diversity and for the proper maintenance of their natural processes. Although human safety is still the number one priority in fire management, new US government objectives include a long-term view of ecosystems. The newest policy allows managers to gauge the relative values of private property and resources in particular situations and to set their priorities accordingly.<ref name=\"USDAFS\"/>\n\nOne of the primary goals in fire management is to improve public education in order to suppress the \"[[Smokey Bear]]\" fire-suppression mentality and introduce the public to the benefits of regular natural fires.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ecology|Environment}}\n* [[Crown sprouting]]\n* [[Evolutionary history of plants]]\n* [[Peat bog fire]]\n* [[Fire history]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*Archibald, S., W.J.
