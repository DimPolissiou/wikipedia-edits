Internal phloem is mostly primary, and begins differentiation later than the external phloem and protoxylem, though it is not without exceptions.

''Secondary'' phloem is laid down by the vascular cambium to the inside of the established layer(s) of phloem.\n\nIn some eudicot families ([[Apocynaceae]], [[Convolvulaceae]], [[Cucurbitaceae]], [[Solanaceae]], [[Myrtaceae]], [[Asteraceae]], [[Thymelaeaceae]]), phloem also develops on the inner side of the vascular cambium; in this case, a distinction between ''external'' and ''internal'' or ''intraxylary'' phloem is made. Internal phloem is mostly primary, and begins differentiation later than the external phloem and protoxylem, though it is not without exceptions. In some other families ([[Amaranthaceae]], [[Nyctaginaceae]], [[Salvadoraceae]]), the cambium also periodically forms inward strands or layers of phloem, embedded in the xylem: Such phloem strands are called ''included'' or ''interxylary'' phloem.<ref>Evert, Ray F.

Supplies of phloem from previous years helped stave off starvation in the great famine of the 1860s which hit both Finland and Sweden ([[Finnish famine of 1866-1868]] and [[Swedish famine of 1867\u20131869]]). Phloem is dried and milled to flour (''pettu'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) and mixed with [[rye]] to form a hard dark bread, [[bark bread]]. The least appreciated was ''silkko'', a bread made only from [[buttermilk]] and ''pettu'' without any real rye or cereal flour. Recently, ''pettu'' has again become available as a curiosity, and some have made claims of health benefits. However, its food energy content is low relative to rye or other cereals.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nPhloem from [[silver birch]] has been also used to make flour in the past.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Apical dominance]]\n*[[Phloem sap]]\n*[[Xylem]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n\n{{Biological tissue}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Plant anatomy]]\n[[Category:Plant physiology]]\n[[Category:Tissues (biology)]]\n", "name_user": "103.26.52.79", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFunction)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phloem"}

Written by [[Paul Lieberstein]] and [[Jennifer Celotta]], and directed by [[Paul Feig]], the episode first aired in the United States on May 15, 2008 on [[NBC]].\n\nThe series\u2014[[mockumentary|presented as if it were a real documentary]]\u2014depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, [[Toby Flenderson]] (Lieberstein) spends his last day at Dunder Mifflin before moving to Costa Rica. [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) develops feelings for the new Human Resources Representative Holly Flax (Ryan), who makes her first appearance in this episode.

Elsewhere, [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J.

The episode received largely positive reviews from critics, with many applauding the introduction of Amy Ryan's character, as well as the ending between Jim and Pam. The episode received 4.1 Nielsen rating and was watched by 8.07 million viewers.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Dunder Mifflin]]'s [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] branch is planning a going-away party for [[Toby Flenderson]] ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) before he leaves for [[Costa Rica]]. [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) is extremely happy that Toby is leaving, but when [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) balks at his unreasonable party demands, [[Phyllis Vance]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) accepts the duty of planning the party. She does fantastically, ordering carnival rides and hiring a band.\n\nMichael's hatred of Toby has been transferred to the new human resources representative, [[Holly Flax]] ([[Amy Ryan]]), and he and [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) plan to haze her. When she playfully affects disdain for Toby, Michael takes her seriously, and suddenly falls in love with her. Taking advice from [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]), Michael succeeds in warming Holly up with small talk and jokes, and even tempers Toby's exit interview, which he had originally planned to be brutally insulting, because Holly attends. During the interview, Pam helps Toby finally get revenge against Michael by making him give up his favorite watch to Toby after discovering he planned on giving him a rock for a going away gift. Dwight, however, continues the [[hazing]], telling Holly that [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) is mentally challenged, and putting a raccoon in her car. When Michael catches Dwight trying to release a raccoon into Holly's car, he loudly proclaims his esteem for Holly. Holly gives special attention to Kevin throughout the episode due to her belief that he is mentally challenged, but Kevin believes her attention is a sexual interest in him.\n\n[[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) reveals that she is spending the summer studying graphic design at [[Pratt Institute]] in [[New York City]]. Meanwhile, Jim calls [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) about a huge sale that he has recently made. Patronizing as ever, Ryan instructs him to enter the sale on the company's website before abruptly hanging up. Jim takes this as another sign that Ryan is trying to push him out of the company, and leaves Ryan a voice mail proclaiming that he will fight Ryan's attempts to fire him. Shortly afterward, [[Creed Bratton (character)|Creed Bratton]] ([[Creed Bratton]]) and Jim find a video on [[YouTube]] of Ryan being arrested for [[Securities fraud|fraud]] in the full presence of his peers who are all recording his arrest on their cell phones and interrupt Toby's exit interview to show Michael, Toby, Pam, and Holly. It is revealed that Ryan's website was floundering, so he double-counted office sales as website sales, fraudulently inflating the firm's figures. Although Michael is deeply concerned for Ryan, Jim is pleased and leaves Ryan a second voice mail mockingly telling Ryan to disregard the last because he had his \"hands tied.\"\n\nMichael discovers that [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) has [[artificial insemination|artificially inseminated]] herself from a [[sperm bank]] when Kevin runs into her at the grocery store. She explains that she did this while she was dating Michael, but still wants him to be involved in the pregnancy. He initially is indecisive, but eventually calls and agrees to attend [[Lamaze]] class with her.\n\nJim contributes several hundred dollars to the party-planning fund in order to buy fireworks, later revealing that he has decided to [[Proposal of marriage|propose]] to Pam, going back to their [[The Client (The Office)|\"first date\"]]. Pam notices the purchase and guesses his intentions; however, at the party, [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) ruins the moment by proposing to Angela, who bitterly accepts. Pam is visibly disappointed that Jim didn't propose to her. Michael has security escort Toby out of the office as a parting insult. Dwight is crushed that his ex-girlfriend is marrying someone else. In the last scene of the episode, Phyllis returns to the office, pleased at the success of her party, where she and the camera crew walk in on Angela and Dwight having sex on one of the desks.\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:Amy Ryan 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The episode introduced the character of [[Holly Flax]], played by [[Amy Ryan]].]]\n\"Goodbye, Toby\" was written by Paul Lieberstein and [[Jennifer Celotta]].<ref name=\"epref\">{{cite episode |title=Goodbye, Toby |series=The Office |serieslink=The Office (American TV series) |credits=[[Paul Feig]] (director); [[Paul Lieberstein]] & [[Jennifer Celotta]] (writers) |network=[[NBC Universal]] |station=[[NBC]] |airdate=May 15, 2008 |season=4 |number=18/19}}</ref> Lieberstein is also the actor who plays Toby Flenderson.<ref name=\"NBC2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/bios/paul_lieberstein.shtml |title=Paul Lieberstein as Toby Flenderson/Writer/Co-Executive Producer |publisher=[[NBC]] |accessdate=July 6, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628135017/http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/bios/paul_lieberstein.shtml |archivedate=June 28, 2008 |df= }}</ref> It took Lieberstein and Celotta four or five days to write this episode.<ref name=\"Questions\">{{cite web |author=Celotta, Jen|url=http://www.officetally.com/jen-celotta-answers-goodbye-toby-questions |title=Jen Celotta answers \u2018Goodbye, Toby\u2019 Questions |publisher=OfficeTally |accessdate=July 6, 2008|date=May 29, 2008}}</ref> Writer Anthony Farrell said that the idea for Dunder Mifflin Infinity to fail was inspired by the days that he was an administrative assistant for [[Countrywide Financial|Countrywide Home Loans]].

When writing the story for the episode, the show originally planned on having Dwight put a badger in Holly's car, but after finding out that it was difficult to get a badger, it was switched to a raccoon. The script also called for the raccoon to attack Meredith, but that was decided against for safety reasons.

[[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) is extremely happy that Toby is leaving, but when [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) balks at his unreasonable party demands, [[Phyllis Vance]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) accepts the duty of planning the party. She does fantastically, ordering carnival rides and hiring a band.\n\nMichael's hatred of Toby has been transferred to the new human resources representative, [[Holly Flax]] ([[Amy Ryan]]), and he and [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) plan to haze her. When she playfully affects disdain for Toby, Michael takes her seriously, and suddenly falls in love with her. Taking advice from [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]), Michael succeeds in warming Holly up with small talk and jokes, and even tempers Toby's exit interview, which he had originally planned to be brutally insulting, because Holly attends. During the interview, Pam helps Toby finally get revenge against Michael by making him give up his favorite watch to Toby after discovering he planned on giving him a rock for a going away gift. Dwight, however, continues the [[hazing]], telling Holly that [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) is mentally challenged, and putting a raccoon in her car. When Michael catches Dwight trying to release a raccoon into Holly's car, he loudly proclaims his esteem for Holly. Holly gives special attention to Kevin throughout the episode due to her belief that he is mentally challenged, but Kevin believes her attention is a sexual interest in him.\n\n[[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) reveals that she is spending the summer studying graphic design at [[Pratt Institute]] in [[New York City]]. Meanwhile, Jim calls [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) about a huge sale that he has recently made. Patronizing as ever, Ryan instructs him to enter the sale on the company's website before abruptly hanging up. Jim takes this as another sign that Ryan is trying to push him out of the company, and leaves Ryan a voice mail proclaiming that he will fight Ryan's attempts to fire him. Shortly afterward, [[Creed Bratton (character)|Creed Bratton]] ([[Creed Bratton]]) and Jim find a video on [[YouTube]] of Ryan being arrested for [[Securities fraud|fraud]] in the full presence of his peers who are all recording his arrest on their cell phones and interrupt Toby's exit interview to show Michael, Toby, Pam, and Holly. It is revealed that Ryan's website was floundering, so he double-counted office sales as website sales, fraudulently inflating the firm's figures. Although Michael is deeply concerned for Ryan, Jim is pleased and leaves Ryan a second voice mail mockingly telling Ryan to disregard the last because he had his \"hands tied.\"\n\nMichael discovers that [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) has [[artificial insemination|artificially inseminated]] herself from a [[sperm bank]] when Kevin runs into her at the grocery store. She explains that she did this while she was dating Michael, but still wants him to be involved in the pregnancy. He initially is indecisive, but eventually calls and agrees to attend [[Lamaze]] class with her.\n\nJim contributes several hundred dollars to the party-planning fund in order to buy fireworks, later revealing that he has decided to [[Proposal of marriage|propose]] to Pam, going back to their [[The Client (The Office)|\"first date\"]]. Pam notices the purchase and guesses his intentions; however, at the party, [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) ruins the moment by proposing to Angela, who bitterly accepts. Pam is visibly disappointed that Jim didn't propose to her. Michael has security escort Toby out of the office as a parting insult. Dwight is crushed that his ex-girlfriend is marrying someone else. In the last scene of the episode, Phyllis returns to the office, pleased at the success of her party, where she and the camera crew walk in on Angela and Dwight having sex on one of the desks.\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:Amy Ryan 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The episode introduced the character of [[Holly Flax]], played by [[Amy Ryan]].]]\n\"Goodbye, Toby\" was written by Paul Lieberstein and [[Jennifer Celotta]].<ref name=\"epref\">{{cite episode |title=Goodbye, Toby |series=The Office |serieslink=The Office (American TV series) |credits=[[Paul Feig]] (director); [[Paul Lieberstein]] & [[Jennifer Celotta]] (writers) |network=[[NBC Universal]] |station=[[NBC]] |airdate=May 15, 2008 |season=4 |number=18/19}}</ref> Lieberstein is also the actor who plays Toby Flenderson.<ref name=\"NBC2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/bios/paul_lieberstein.shtml |title=Paul Lieberstein as Toby Flenderson/Writer/Co-Executive Producer |publisher=[[NBC]] |accessdate=July 6, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628135017/http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/bios/paul_lieberstein.shtml |archivedate=June 28, 2008 |df= }}</ref> It took Lieberstein and Celotta four or five days to write this episode.<ref name=\"Questions\">{{cite web |author=Celotta, Jen|url=http://www.officetally.com/jen-celotta-answers-goodbye-toby-questions |title=Jen Celotta answers \u2018Goodbye, Toby\u2019 Questions |publisher=OfficeTally |accessdate=July 6, 2008|date=May 29, 2008}}</ref> Writer Anthony Farrell said that the idea for Dunder Mifflin Infinity to fail was inspired by the days that he was an administrative assistant for [[Countrywide Financial|Countrywide Home Loans]].

After \"Goodbye, Toby\" aired, the video was released to the public. When writing the story for the episode, the show originally planned on having Dwight put a badger in Holly's car, but after finding out that it was difficult to get a badger, it was switched to a raccoon. The script also called for the raccoon to attack Meredith, but that was decided against for safety reasons. During one of the takes wherein Michael is singing his parody songs, Carell grabbed a guitar and played an [[Eddie Van Halen]] [[guitar solo]], but that scene was cut because it did not match Michael's character.<ref name=\"Questions\"/> After filming, the editors had about 72 minutes of material that they needed to cut down into 40 minutes.<ref name=\"Questions\"/>\n\n\"Goodbye, Toby\" introduced Holly Flax, played by Amy Ryan, who would go on to become Michael's main love interest. In fact, her return to the series in the [[The Office (U.S. season 7)|seventh season]] was used by the writers as a way to write Steve Carell out of the series after his contract ended.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bellikoff|first=Sam|title=Here, Baby, Here!

Written by [[executive producer]] and [[show runner]] [[Greg Daniels]] and directed by [[Ken Kwapis]], the episode first aired in the United States on September 21, 2006 on [[NBC]].\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In the episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) discovers that [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) is [[gay]]. Michael tries to show Oscar that he is accepting of his sexual orientation, but only ends up insulting him. It is also revealed that after kissing [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]), [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) went through with transferring to Stamford. In addition, Pam called off her engagement with [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy Anderson]] ([[David Denman]]).\n\nThe episode features a kiss between Michael and Oscar. This scene was not scripted, and was an improvised moment courtesy of Carell. An estimated 9.1 million viewers watched the episode, a 23 percent increase from the previous [[The Office (U.S. season 2)|season premiere]] \"[[The Dundies]]\". \"Gay Witch Hunt\" received positive reviews from television critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter calling [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) \"[[Faggot (epithet)|faggy]]\", [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) learns that Oscar finds the word offensive because he is [[Homosexuality|homosexual]].  Michael inadvertently [[Outing|outs]] Oscar to the entire office. [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) berates Michael for his behavior, after Michael's seminar on homosexuality is a disaster. When Oscar threatens to quit, Michael attempts to reconcile with Oscar, first by hugging him, and then kissing him on the lips. Oscar is given three months paid vacation and use of a company car in exchange for not suing [[Dunder Mifflin]].\n\nIt is revealed that after their kiss, [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) confirmed to [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) her intention to marry [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy Anderson]] ([[David Denman]]). However, a few days before the wedding, Pam got [[cold feet (metaphor)|cold feet]] and decided to call it off. She moved into her own apartment and began taking art classes. Pam's rejection sent Roy into a downward spiral, hitting rock bottom with a [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] arrest. When being interviewed by the camera crew, Roy makes a vow to win Pam back.\n\nJim has transferred to Dunder Mifflin's [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branch and settles into his new office. He then meets smug co-worker [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) who brags about his wild college days at [[Cornell University]]. Meanwhile, sales representative [[Karen Filippelli]] ([[Rashida Jones]]) is disconcerted by Jim's constant smirks to the camera.\n\n== Production ==\n\"Gay Witch Hunt\" was the eighth episode of the series directed by [[Ken Kwapis]].

Before the accession of the infant king [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (John's son) in 1216, Fulk's manor of Alveston had already been seized by the crown: in the following year (1217) all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218, however, Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered to be restored to him by the king's regents.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41, 43</ref> By 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington.<ref>T.D.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

They included particularly [[Whittington Castle]], held by the Peverels during the reign of King Stephen. Whittington Castle stands on the English side of [[Offa's Dyke]], which before and during the Norman era formed the border between England and [[Wales]].

Before the accession of the infant king [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (John's son) in 1216, Fulk's manor of Alveston had already been seized by the crown: in the following year (1217) all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218, however, Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered to be restored to him by the king's regents.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41, 43</ref> By 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington. \n\nIn 1223 however Whittington Castle fell to [[Llywelyn the Great]], Prince of Wales. Fulk regained it the following year, although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized. By 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41-42</ref><ref>I.J.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

After being taken to the hospital, Meredith is found to have rabies. In an attempt to make amends with Meredith, Michael sponsors a fun run for rabies. Meanwhile, it is revealed that [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) are dating, while [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) is mad at [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) for killing her cat Sprinkles.\n\nThe episode received mixed reviews from the varying critics, while most praised the episode for Jim and Pam's relationship. However, critics had differing opinions when it came to how Michael behaved throughout the episode.\n\n==Plot==\nOver the summer, [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) moved in with [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]), [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B.

Jim and [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) claim that they see each other socially but only as friends. The documentary crew catches Pam picking up Jim in her car. They kiss and drive away. When faced with the footage of them kissing, Jim and Pam admit to the documentary crew that they are secretly dating.\n\nAs he arrives at work, Michael accidentally hits [[Meredith Palmer]] ([[Kate Flannery]]) with his car, sending her to the hospital for a fractured pelvis. Forced to join a group visit to Meredith in the hospital, [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) leaves [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) with complicated instructions on the care of her ailing cat Sprinkles. During the hospital visit, Michael fails to obtain forgiveness from Meredith. When Angela returns to the office, Dwight informs her that her cat is dead. Dwight explains to Angela that he killed her cat because it was suffering, and that this is normal on the farm. Angela is furious, because being euthanized prevents Sprinkles from being in \"cat heaven\".\n\nThe combination of Meredith's accident, Sprinkles' death, and a [[computer virus|virus]] on Pam's computer (which is cleaned by the company's tech support employee, [[List of characters from The Office (US T.V. series)#Sadiq|Sadiq]], portrayed by [[Omi Vaidya]]) convinces Michael that the office is cursed. He insists that he is not superstitious, but rather \"a little-stitious\". Dwight discovers that Meredith has had a precautionary [[rabies]] shot due to [[Business School (The Office)|several animal bites]]. Michael immediately takes credit for saving Meredith's life by sending her to the hospital and declares the curse over. But, still feeling guilty about hurting Meredith, Michael organizes a charity five-kilometer (3.1 miles) [[fun run]] to raise awareness of the dangers of rabies. Over half of the money raised is spent on the check presentation ceremony. Whilst Michael is getting changed for the race, Pam sees him [[nudity|naked]]. Few take the race seriously (Creed, Oscar and Stanley sneak off to a bar while Jim and Pam visit a garage sale) and while [[Toby Flenderson]] ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) finishes first and Michael becomes ill, having \"[[carbohydrate loading|carbo-load]]ed\" (he ate [[fettucini alfredo]] before the race) and abstained from water.

I can do that better than he can.'\" At first, Flannery would flinch before hitting the glass, until director Greg Daniels was able to get her to not think about it.<ref name=\"Convention\">{{cite web |url=http://theoffice.wikia.com/wiki/The_Office_Convention_2007_Cast_Q&A#Kate_Flannery:_Getting_run_over |title=''The Office'' Convention 2007 Cast Q&A |accessdate=June 30, 2008 |work= |publisher=theoffice.wikia.com |date=}}</ref> Flannery's arms were bruised, due to having to film the scene multiple times.

Most of the shorts are shown in their original English-speaking versions, with Norwegian subtitles.\n\nThe following shorts are usually shown, in integral or edited format:\n\n*''[[Santa's Workshop (film)|Santa's Workshop]]''\n*''[[Clown of the Jungle]]''\n*''[[Pluto's Christmas Tree]]''\n*''[[Mickey's Trailer]]''\n*''[[Ferdinand the Bull (film)|Ferdinand the Bull]]''\n\nThese feature films are represented through important scenes:\n\n*''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''\n*''[[Bambi]]''\n*''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''\n*''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''\n*''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''\n\n== Sweden ==\nIn Sweden, the show is called '''''Kalle Anka och hans v\u00e4nner \u00f6nskar God Jul''''' (\"[[Donald Duck]] and His Friends Wish You a Merry Christmas\"). It is broadcast on [[SVT1]] at 3:00&nbsp;p.m. as part of the channel's traditional Christmas Eve programming, including a live host, most prominently [[Arne Weise]] from 1972 through 2002. The title reflects the fact that Donald Duck is far more popular than [[Mickey Mouse]] in Sweden. The montage is narrated by [[Bengt Feldreich]], dubbing the original English voice of [[Jiminy Cricket]] ([[Cliff Edwards]]).<ref name=\"slate-nordicquack\" />\n\nThe special, which is typically referred to as simply ''Kalle Anka'' (Donald Duck), along with its characters and cartoons, are ingrained in Swedish pop culture as a Christmas tradition. The popularity of ''Kalle Anka'' in Sweden as a television event was influenced by several factors, including the fact that for the ten years since the special's original premiere in 1960,<ref>https://www.kalleanka.se/ankeborgsposten/kalle-anka-och-hans-vanner-onskar-god-jul/</ref> SVT1 was the only television channel in the country ([[SVT2]] launched in 1969), and even then, the country's public broadcaster [[Sveriges Television]] had a monopoly on television broadcasting until the 1987 launch of the country's [[TV3 (Sweden)|first commercial channel]]. At the time, it was also one of the few occasions that U.S.-produced animation was broadcast on Swedish television.<ref name=\"slate-nordicquack\" /> ''Kalle Anka'' has remained one of the most-watched television specials in the country: usually drawing more than five million viewers up until the 1990s (in a country with then less than nine million inhabitants), and still drawing 3.3 million viewers in 2019 (when Sweden had over ten million inhabitants).<ref>https://www.svd.se/sa-manga-sag-kalle-anka-pa-julafton (Swedish)</ref>\n\nDue to its legacy and prominence, the special has remained relatively unchanged (aside from each year promoting one or two new Disney films). The Swedish public has been protective of ''Kalle Anka'', resisting any significant changes to the special's content: in the 1970s, when SVT's head of children's programming disclosed plans to discontinue the special due to growing anti-commercial sentiment in the country, public outcry resulted in the special being maintained. A similar backlash was faced in 1982 when ''Ferdinand the Bull'' was replaced with ''[[The Ugly Duckling (1939 film)|The Ugly Duckling]]''\u2014a change that was quickly reverted the following year.<ref name=\"slate-nordicquack\" /> In 1992, Weise planned to pre-record his hosting segments so he could spend Christmas with his family, but backed down after receiving criticism for breaking the tradition of hosting it live. In a 2007 interview, Weise quipped that hosting the special had affected his personal life, stating that he had three [[divorce]]s as a result of it.<ref name=\"slate-nordicquack\" /> In 2012, Disney decided to edit the ''Santa's Workshop'' segment, removing \"cultural stereotypes\",<ref>https://www.svt.se/kultur/film/disney-censurerar-i-kalle-ankas-jul</ref> that had been restored to the episode in 1983, provoking another public debate.<ref>https://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/60-%C3%A5r-av-%C3%A4ndringar-s%C3%A5-har-kalle-ankas-jul-gjorts-om-1.21651167</ref>\n\nThe following shorts are usually shown, in integral or edited format:\n\n*''[[Santa's Workshop (film)|Santa's Workshop]]''\n*''[[Clown of the Jungle]]''\n*''[[Pluto's Christmas Tree]]''\n*''[[Mickey's Trailer]]''\n*''[[Ferdinand the Bull (film)|Ferdinand the Bull]]''\n\nThese feature films are represented through important scenes:\n\n*''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''\n*''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''\n*''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''\n*''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''\n*''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Number of viewers (according to Mediam\u00e4tning i Skandinavien).<ref>http://hottoptv.mms.se/hottop.asp</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Viewers\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n| 2017 || 3 734 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2016 || 3 734 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2015 || 3 460 000 || Second most watched show of the year\n|-\n| 2014 || 3 705 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2013 || 3 570 000 || Fourth most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2012 || 3 883 000 || Second most watched show of the year\n|-\n| 2011 || 3 495 000 || Second most watched show of the year\n|-\n| 2010 || 3 356 000 || Second most watched show of the year\n|-\n| 2009 || 3 294 000 || Second most watched show of the year\n|-\n| 2008 || 3 215 000 || Third most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2007 || 3 490 000<ref>Svenska Dagbladet on 28 December 2007</ref> || Second most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2006 || 3 610 000 || Second most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2005 || 3 515 000 || Second most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2004 || 3 685 000 || Third most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2003 || 3 410 000 || Fourth most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2002 || 3 655 000 || Second most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2001 || 3 825 000 || Second most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2000 || 3 565 000 || Fourth most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1999 || 4 165 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1998 || 3 599 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1997 || 4 319 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1996 || 4 124 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1995 || 3 880 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1994 || 3 223 000 || Third most popular show of the year (1: Melodifestivalen 19940227, 2: Winter Olympics 19940312)\n|}\n\n== Russia ==\nIn Russia, this show is called '''''\u0421 \u0420\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c, \u043e\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0446\u0430!'''''

The American version has been infrequently shown since 1980.\n\nThe original American version features the following shorts:\n*''[[Santa's Workshop (film)|Santa's Workshop]]'' (1932)\n*''[[Toy Tinkers]]'' (1949)\n\nAs well as clips from the following feature films, labeled in the special as \"Memorable Moments\":\n*''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' - \"You Can Fly!\"\n*''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]''\n*''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' - \"[[I've Got No Strings]]\"\n*''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' - \"[[Bella Notte]]\"\n*''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' - \"The Work Song\" / \"[[A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]\"\n*''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' - \"[[The Silly Song]]\"\n\nThe special ends with Jiminy Cricket sharing ''his'' memorable moment, his song \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" (from ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''), which he states \"symbolizes faith, hope and all the things that Christmas stands for\". Starting in 1963 and continuing through the 1970s, all of the scenes with Walt and Tinker Bell's intros, as well as ''Santa's Workshop'', had been replaced by a teaser for Disney's new or upcoming feature films, including ''[[The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'', ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', ''[[The Aristocats]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]''. Goofy's cartoon ''The Art of Skiing'' was added in the 1983 broadcast.\n\n== Denmark ==\n\nIn Denmark the show is called '''''Disneys Juleshow: Fra alle os til alle jer''''' (\"Disney's Christmas Show: From All of Us to All of You\") and is broadcast every Christmas Eve at 4 PM on [[DR1]]. It is narrated by Danish actor [[Ove Sprog\u00f8e]] who does the Danish voice of [[Jiminy Cricket]]. Clips from feature films are voiced in Danish while shorts are in English with Danish subtitles.\n\nThe Danish version features the following shorts:\n*''[[Pluto's Christmas Tree]]'' (1952)\n*''[[Donald's Snow Fight]]'' (1942)\n\nAs well as clips from the following feature films:\n*''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''\n*''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''\n*''[[Bambi]]''\n*''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''\n*''[[The Aristocats]]''\n*''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''\n*''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''\n\nIt ends with [[Bj\u00f8rn Tidmand]] singing \"[[When You Wish upon a Star]]\" in Danish (\"N\u00e5r Du Ser et Stjerneskud\") and a sneak peek of either an upcoming or a clip from a recently released Disney movie.\n\n== Finland ==\nIn Finland, this show is called '''''Samu Sirkan joulutervehdys''''', (\"[[Jiminy Cricket]]'s Christmas Greeting\") and it is shown every Christmas Eve evening on [[MTV3]].\n\nThe Finnish version features clips from the following shorts:\n*''[[Pluto's Christmas Tree]]'' (1952)\n*''[[The Clock Watcher]]'' (1945)\n*''[[The Small One]]'' (1978)\n\nAs well as clips from the following feature films:\n*''[[The Three Caballeros]]''\n*''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''\n*''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''\n*''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''\n*''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''\n\nA special \"surprise\" clip (from a recent or upcoming Disney feature premiere) is dubbed in Finnish but everything else is in English, with Finnish subtitles.\n\n== Norway ==\nIn Norway, the show is called '''''Donald Duck og vennene hans''''' (\"[[Donald Duck]] and his friends\") on [[NRK]] and '''''Disneys julekavalkade''''' (Disney's Christmas [[Cavalcade]]) on [[TV Norge]] in 2003, and it is shown every Christmas Eve afternoon on NRK1. Most of the shorts are shown in their original English-speaking versions, with Norwegian subtitles.\n\nThe following shorts are usually shown, in integral or edited format:\n\n*''[[Santa's Workshop (film)|Santa's Workshop]]''\n*''[[Clown of the Jungle]]''\n*''[[Pluto's Christmas Tree]]''\n*''[[Mickey's Trailer]]''\n*''[[Ferdinand the Bull (film)|Ferdinand the Bull]]''\n\nThese feature films are represented through important scenes:\n\n*''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''\n*''[[Bambi]]''\n*''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''\n*''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''\n*''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''\n\n== Sweden ==\nIn Sweden, the show is called '''''Kalle Anka och hans v\u00e4nner \u00f6nskar God Jul''''' (\"[[Donald Duck]] and His Friends Wish You a Merry Christmas\"). It is broadcast on [[SVT1]] at 3:00&nbsp;p.m. as part of the channel's traditional Christmas Eve programming, including a live host, most prominently [[Arne Weise]] from 1972 through 2002. The title reflects the fact that Donald Duck is far more popular than [[Mickey Mouse]] in Sweden. The montage is narrated by [[Bengt Feldreich]], dubbing the original English voice of [[Jiminy Cricket]] ([[Cliff Edwards]]).<ref name=\"slate-nordicquack\" />\n\nThe special, which is typically referred to as simply ''Kalle Anka'' (Donald Duck), along with its characters and cartoons, are ingrained in Swedish pop culture as a Christmas tradition. The popularity of ''Kalle Anka'' in Sweden as a television event was influenced by several factors, including the fact that for the ten years since the special's original premiere in 1960<ref>https://www.kalleanka.se/ankeborgsposten/kalle-anka-och-hans-vanner-onskar-god-jul/</ref>, SVT1 was the only television channel in the country ([[SVT2]] launched in 1969), and even then, the country's public broadcaster [[Sveriges Television]] had a monopoly on television broadcasting until the 1987 launch of the country's [[TV3 (Sweden)|first commercial channel]]. At the time, it was also one of the few occasions that U.S.-produced animation was broadcast on Swedish television.<ref name=\"slate-nordicquack\" /> ''Kalle Anka'' has remained one of the most-watched television specials in the country: usually drawing more than five million viewers up until the 1990s (in a country with then less than nine million inhabitants), and still drawing 3.3 million viewers in 2019 (when Sweden had over ten million inhabitants).<ref>https://www.svd.se/sa-manga-sag-kalle-anka-pa-julafton (Swedish)</ref>. \n\nDue to its legacy and prominence, the special has remained relatively unchanged (aside from each year promoting one or two new Disney films). The Swedish public has been protective of ''Kalle Anka'', resisting any significant changes to the special's content: in the 1970s, when SVT's head of children's programming disclosed plans to discontinue the special due to growing anti-commercial sentiment in the country, public outcry resulted in the special being maintained. A similar backlash was faced in 1982 when ''Ferdinand the Bull'' was replaced with ''[[The Ugly Duckling (1939 film)|The Ugly Duckling]]''\u2014a change that was quickly reverted the following year.<ref name=\"slate-nordicquack\" /> In 1992, Weise planned to pre-record his hosting segments so he could spend Christmas with his family, but backed down after receiving criticism for breaking the tradition of hosting it live. In a 2007 interview, Weise quipped that hosting the special had affected his personal life, stating that he had three [[divorce]]s as a result of it.<ref name=\"slate-nordicquack\" /> In 2012, Disney decided to edit the ''Santa's Workshop'' segment, removing \"cultural stereotypes\",<ref>https://www.svt.se/kultur/film/disney-censurerar-i-kalle-ankas-jul</ref> that had been restored to the episode in 1983, provoking another public debate.<ref>https://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/60-%C3%A5r-av-%C3%A4ndringar-s%C3%A5-har-kalle-ankas-jul-gjorts-om-1.21651167</ref>\n\nThe following shorts are usually shown, in integral or edited format:\n\n*''[[Santa's Workshop (film)|Santa's Workshop]]''\n*''[[Clown of the Jungle]]''\n*''[[Pluto's Christmas Tree]]''\n*''[[Mickey's Trailer]]''\n*''[[Ferdinand the Bull (film)|Ferdinand the Bull]]''\n\nThese feature films are represented through important scenes:\n\n*''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''\n*''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''\n*''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''\n*''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''\n*''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Number of viewers (according to Mediam\u00e4tning i Skandinavien).<ref>http://hottoptv.mms.se/hottop.asp</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Viewers\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n| 2017 || 3 734 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2016 || 3 734 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2015 || 3 460 000 || Second most watched show of the year\n|-\n| 2014 || 3 705 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2013 || 3 570 000 || Fourth most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2012 || 3 883 000 || Second most watched show of the year\n|-\n| 2011 || 3 495 000 || Second most watched show of the year\n|-\n| 2010 || 3 356 000 || Second most watched show of the year\n|-\n| 2009 || 3 294 000 || Second most watched show of the year\n|-\n| 2008 || 3 215 000 || Third most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2007 || 3 490 000<ref>Svenska Dagbladet on 28 December 2007</ref> || Second most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2006 || 3 610 000 || Second most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2005 || 3 515 000 || Second most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2004 || 3 685 000 || Third most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2003 || 3 410 000 || Fourth most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2002 || 3 655 000 || Second most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2001 || 3 825 000 || Second most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 2000 || 3 565 000 || Fourth most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1999 || 4 165 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1998 || 3 599 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1997 || 4 319 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1996 || 4 124 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1995 || 3 880 000 || Most popular show of the year\n|-\n| 1994 || 3 223 000 || Third most popular show of the year (1: Melodifestivalen 19940227, 2: Winter Olympics 19940312)\n|}\n\n== Russia ==\nIn Russia, this show is called '''''\u0421 \u0420\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c, \u043e\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0446\u0430!'''''

The people became angry at Tone, forcing him to flee. Nobody wanted to protect him but a solitary dweller who had stones that turned miraculously into cattle. The dweller bid that Tone never open the stable of the cattle. When Tone did not heed the warning and the cattle escaped, Tone followed them, but the fleeing cattle threw up hills to run on, including Mawenzi and Kibo. Tone finally collapsed on Kibo, ending the pursuit.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAnother legend has it that Kibo and Mawenzi were good neighbours, until Mawenzi played a prank on Kibo and threw away embers he had received from Kibo and claimed that they had burned out. Kibo eventually got angry and beat Mawenzi badly, explaining why the mountain is so badly degraded. This theory explains Mawenzi's name as \"the Battered\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} -->\nA legend tells of ivory-filled graves of elephants on the mountain, and of a cow named Rayli that produces miraculous fat from her tail glands.

The people became angry at Tone, forcing him to flee. Nobody wanted to protect him but a solitary dweller who had stones that turned miraculously into cattle. The dweller bid that Tone never open the stable of the cattle. When Tone did not heed the warning and the cattle escaped, Tone followed them, but the fleeing cattle threw up hills to run on, including Mawenzi and Kibo. Tone finally collapsed on Kibo, ending the pursuit.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAnother legend has it that Kibo and Mawenzi were good neighbours, until Mawenzi played a prank on Kibo and threw away embers he had received from Kibo and claimed that they had burned out. Kibo eventually got angry and beat Mawenzi badly, explaining why the mountain is so badly degraded. This theory explains Mawenzi's name as \"the Battered\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} -->\nA legend tells of ivory-filled graves of elephants on the mountain, and of a cow named Rayli that produces miraculous fat from her tail glands.

J. Novak]]). Ryan starts acting erratically, and it is revealed that he is under the influence of drugs. Meanwhile, the remaining employees are going to be forced to work on a Saturday. [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) proposes that they work late on Friday, so they do not have to come in the next day. Once Jim and his co-workers finish working, they find that they are locked in, and everyone quickly places the blame on Jim.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) arrives at the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the [[Dunder Mifflin Paper Company]] and is noticeably friendlier than on his previous visits. The employees, by now fed up with Ryan's new website, angrily ask him questions about the website and their clients. Ryan shows the staff at the branch the new Dunder Mifflin website, \"Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2.0\", the previous version of which was shut down because sexual predators had invaded the social networking component of the site. As Ryan leaves, he tells [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) of the women he meets in clubs in [[New York City]]. Michael and [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) decide to go to New York, locate Ryan, attend parties with him, and try to meet women while doing so.\n\nIn New York, Michael and Dwight visit the club Ryan frequents. Ryan is thrilled to see them but appears to be under the influence of [[drug]]s, though Michael and Dwight do not notice. Later, Michael, Dwight, Ryan and Ryan's colleague Troy Underbridge ([[Noel Petok]]) wait outside another club, which does not allow anyone in who does not have a date. Dwight pairs each of them with members of a women's basketball team who are waiting in line. Inside the club, Ryan's dancing becomes erratic, and he accidentally hits a girl, prompting her friends to attack him. Dwight and Michael escort him out of the club, and after Troy advises them not to take Ryan to a hospital, he runs off. Michael and Dwight bring Ryan back to his apartment, where he tells them that he thinks Troy has a [[drug addiction|drug problem]], and asks what he should do about it. Michael, oblivious to the fact that Ryan is referring to his own drug addiction, gives him hypothetical advice involving a [[wiretap]] and snitching on a [[drug dealer]].\n\nBack in Scranton, the rest of the employees are going to be forced to work on a Saturday to record their own sales as the website's sales, which is, according to Ryan, \"a temporary procedure to increase the legitimacy of the website.\" [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) suggests everyone stay in the office late instead of coming in for the Saturday. They all agree to the plan, but Jim forgets to tell the security guard they are staying late. After working until 9:00&nbsp;pm, they find the parking lot gates locked, and are unable to return to the office because [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) locked the door from the inside, and Dwight has both the spare and master keys.

J. Novak]]). Ryan starts acting erratically, and it is revealed that he is under the influence of drugs. Meanwhile, the remaining employees are going to be forced to work on a Saturday. [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) proposes that they work late on Friday, so they do not have to come in the next day. Once Jim and his co-workers finish working, they find that they are locked in, and everyone quickly places the blame on Jim.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) arrives at the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the [[Dunder Mifflin Paper Company]] and is noticeably friendlier than on his previous visits. The employees, by now fed up with Ryan's new website, angrily ask him questions about the website and their clients. Ryan shows the staff at the branch the new Dunder Mifflin website, \"Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2.0\", the previous version of which was shut down because sexual predators had invaded the social networking component of the site. As Ryan leaves, he tells [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) of the women he meets in clubs in [[New York City]]. Michael and [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) decide to go to New York, locate Ryan, attend parties with him, and try to meet women while doing so.\n\nIn New York, Michael and Dwight visit the club Ryan frequents. Ryan is thrilled to see them but appears to be under the influence of [[drug]]s, though Michael and Dwight do not notice. Later, Michael, Dwight, Ryan and Ryan's colleague Troy Underbridge ([[Noel Petok]]) wait outside another club, which does not allow anyone in who does not have a date. Dwight pairs each of them with members of a women's basketball team who are waiting in line. Inside the club, Ryan's dancing becomes erratic, and he accidentally hits a girl, prompting her friends to attack him. Dwight and Michael escort him out of the club, and after Troy advises them not to take Ryan to a hospital, he runs off. Michael and Dwight bring Ryan back to his apartment, where he tells them that he thinks Troy has a [[drug addiction|drug problem]], and asks what he should do about it. Michael, oblivious to the fact that Ryan is referring to his own drug addiction, gives him hypothetical advice involving a [[wiretap]] and snitching on a [[drug dealer]].\n\nBack in Scranton, the rest of the employees are going to be forced to work on a Saturday to record their own sales as the website's sales, which is, according to Ryan, \"a temporary procedure to increase the legitimacy of the website.\" [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) suggests everyone stay in the office late instead of coming in for the Saturday. They all agree to the plan, but Jim forgets to tell the security guard they are staying late. After working until 9:00&nbsp;pm, they find the parking lot gates locked, and are unable to return to the office because [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) locked the door from the inside, and Dwight has both the spare and master keys. Jim calls Hank the security guard (Hugh Dane), who puts off coming to let them out because Jim neglected to collect money for his last annual tip. Pam accidentally injures Meredith by hitting her head with a football that was found in the parking lot. Sitting in the lobby area waiting for the security guard to arrive, the employees vote by a show of hands that Andy and Angela are a better couple than Jim and Pam.\n\nDuring a moment of levity, [[Toby Flenderson]] ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) reaches over and feels Pam's knee.

Its shore-based facilities are located in the village of [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts|Woods Hole]], [[Massachusetts]], United States and a mile and a half away on the Quissett Campus. The bulk of the Institution's funding comes from grants and contracts from the [[National Science Foundation]] and other government agencies, augmented by foundations and private donations.\n\nWHOI scientists, engineers, and students collaborate to develop theories, test ideas, build seagoing instruments, and collect data in diverse marine environments. Ships operated by WHOI carry research scientists throughout the world\u2019s oceans. The WHOI fleet includes two large research vessels (''[[RV Atlantis (AGOR-25)|Atlantis]]'' and ''[[RV Neil Armstrong (AGOR-27)|Neil Armstrong]]''), the coastal craft ''[[R/V Tioga|Tioga]]'', small research craft such as the dive-operation work boat Echo, the deep-diving human-occupied submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]'', the tethered, remotely operated vehicle [[Jason (ROV)|Jason/Medea]], and autonomous underwater vehicles such as the [[REMUS (AUV)|REMUS]] and [[SeaBED]].\n\nWHOI offers graduate and post-doctoral studies in marine science.

The episode is also a [[satire]] and commentary on [[Discrimination against the homeless|how homeless people are often seen as \"degenerates to society\"]].\n\n==Plot==\nAfter a buildup of homeless people in South Park, Kyle recommends that they do something about it, and Cartman agrees. Cartman announces that he will jump over them on his skateboard, wearing a cape, insisting that it was Kyle's idea. The town council has also taken notice of the problem, but the [[Park County, Colorado|Park County]]'s expert on homelessness advises that if no-one gives them anything, they will leave.\n\n[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] feels bad for the homeless, and gives one of them twenty [[American currency|dollars]] that he was originally saving up for a new Xbox game, but the homeless man just asks Kyle for more money. The number of homeless immediately grows dramatically, and they wander everywhere asking for change in a [[zombie]]-like manner. [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]], the [[Stephen and Linda Stotch|Stotches]], [[Jimbo Kern|Jimbo]], and [[Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Gerald Broflovski]] wind up stranded on top of the town Community Center, with hordes of homeless below. Gerald tries to make it through the homeless to get to the bus, but gives them all his change, only to realize that he has no money for the bus.\n\nThe boys escape the horde of homeless in the sewers and head for the home of the homeless expert. He informs the boys that homeless people actually live on change, almost like food.  He tells them that the nearby town of [[Evergreen, Colorado|Evergreen]] had solved a similar homeless problem, and that they should travel there and find out what they did. Once they leave, homeless people try to get into his home, and he shoots himself in the head to \"take the easy way out.\" This fails to work, since he consistently shoots himself nine times in various non-lethal areas of the head and torso (a close parody of the [[50 Cent|Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson]] shooting). As the boys travel, more adults escape to the Community Center roof. One of the adults, Glenn, is able to call his wife on his cellphone after getting a signal and discovers that, because of the high numbers of homeless in South Park, property values have plummeted and his house has been [[repossession|repossessed]], making him homeless.  He begins to ask the others for \"change\" to put his belongings in storage, and Randy (predictably)  then shoots Glenn's head off with a [[shotgun]] proclaiming \"He was becoming one of them!\"\n\nThe boys make it to Evergreen, which has been completely devastated. There are only three remaining survivors, who are men dressed in [[Military camouflage|camouflage]] and heavily armed. They are distrustful of the boys and threaten to shoot them, since, they are not home-owners due to them being minors, and are therefore \"homeless\", but they're able to recognize Cartman as the \"kid who jumped over thirty homeless people on his skateboard\", so they decide to help the boys. While talking to the survivors, they are able to explain that the homeless situation got so out of control that it was hard to tell who was homeless and who wasn't. During the discussion, Kyle finds a pamphlet on the ground, which advertises South Park as a \"haven for the homeless\"; He realizes that the Evergreen townspeople got rid of their homeless by convincing them to migrate to South Park, and the men were able to explain that most of the homeless from their town originally came from [[Texas]], in which the city of [[San Antonio]] was able to get rid of their homeless population by sending them to Evergreen in the same manner. Just then, a hideously disfigured woman is able to emerge from the burnt remains of one of the buildings while holding a shotgun, revealing to be the wife of one of the men who tried to burn her alive after believing she was homeless, and she became quite angered with him as a result. She then tries to shoot her husband, and all the adults end up shooting and killing each other, with the boys realizing that they must get rid of the homeless because, as Stan reasons, their parents are just as stupid as the people of Evergreen, and South Park would fall apart just like Evergreen did.\n\nHowever, Kyle is able to come up with a plan to save their town, so the boys heavily reinforce a bus that they find and drive it to the Community Center in South Park, where the homeless have gathered below the adults. They advertise [[California]] as \"super cool to the homeless\" by singing a modified version of [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]] and [[Dr. Dre]]'s \"[[California Love]],\" and leads them there. Afterwards, Cartman shows off by jumping his skateboard over three homeless people, and the episode ends with Stan saying to Kyle \"I seriously don't know what you see in this.\"\n\n==Production==\nWriting on the episode's basic story and jokes began at the show's writer's retreat at Hyatt Grand Champions Resort conference center, in [[Indian Wells, California]] during the break between seasons 10 and 11.<ref name= rstone>{{cite web| url= https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/south_park_still_sick_still_wrong/page/1| title= Still Sick, Still Wrong| author= Vanessa Grigoriadis| publisher= Rolling Stone Magazine| date= 2007-03-22| accessdate= 2008-08-10| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070622121328/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/south_park_still_sick_still_wrong/page/1| archive-date= 2007-06-22| url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\nThe song at the end of the episode includes the lyrics, \"In the city of Venice, right by Matt's house, you can chill if you're homeless.\" According to the DVD commentary, Matt Stone does live in [[Venice, California|Venice]] and there are a lot of homeless people there.<ref name=\"commentary\">{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=March 2008 |title=South Park: The Complete Eleventh Season: \"Night of the Living Homeless\"|format=Audio commentary |url=http://southpark.cc.com/clips/i48dcq/creator-commentary-night-of-the-living-homeless |medium=DVD Disc|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe episode was rated 7.5 out of 10.0 on [[IGN]], reviewer Travis Fickett describing the episode as \"a take-it-or-leave-it episode\".
