Illinois|Lake County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]. The population was 20,120 at the 2000 census, and 25,113 in 2010. Home of David Dobrik. Vernon Hills serves as a retail hub for its surrounding area ([[Libertyville, Illinois|Libertyville]], [[Lake Forest, Illinois|Lake Forest]], [[Long Grove, Illinois|Long Grove]], [[Lincolnshire, Illinois|Lincolnshire]] and [[Buffalo Grove, Illinois|Buffalo Grove]]).\n\n== History ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2012}}\nThe land that was to become Vernon Hills, founded by Richard Theodore Freese, Ron Freese, and Jim Carswell, began with the establishment of a {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm in 1857. Use of the land remained relatively static until the 1960s, when part of it was purchased for a residential community and golf course; the development was the first use of the name \"Vernon Hills.\" On June 16, 1968, the village officially incorporated with 123 residents and 125 houses in a single subdivision built by Quinn Hogan and Barney Loeb.<ref name=\"vernonhills.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vernonhills.org/Index.aspx?NID=108|title=History of Vernon Hills|publisher=Village of Vernon Hills|access-date=April 7, 2017}}</ref> During these times, the village and police department were run from a local motel until 1971 when village trustees bought two portable buildings.<ref name=\"vernonhills.org\"/> It saw steady but slow growth until the annexing of a plot of land near the corner of IL-60 and [[Illinois Route 21|IL-21]] in 1971, which led to the building of {{convert|1200000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Hawthorn Mall|Hawthorn Center]]. By 1980, the village's population had grown to almost 10,000 residents, and by 2000, it had surpassed 20,000.\n\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s, the village grew geographically through the annexation of surrounding areas. This included land that would become the Corporate Woods business park and Centennial Crossing residential development (1986), a {{convert|1200|acre|km2|adj=on}} section of [[Libertyville, Illinois#History|Hawthorne-Mellody Farms]] (1988), and part of the village of [[Half Day, Illinois|Half Day]] (1994). In 2000, the village acquired land that had belonged at different times to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as a [[Project Nike|Nike missile base]], the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] as a naval training center, and the [[Curtiss Candy Company]]; it was converted to what is now the {{convert|184|acre|km2|adj=on}} [http://www.vhparkdistrict.org/parks/vhac/ Vernon Hills Athletic Complex] (VHAC).\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, Vernon Hills has a total area of {{convert|7.917|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|7.71|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 97.39%) is land and {{convert|0.207|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 2.61%) is water.<ref name=\"census-g001\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1777694\n  |title=G001 - Geographic Identifiers - 2010 Census Summary File 1\n  |accessdate=2015-12-25\n  |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]\n  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213082407/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1777694\n  |archive-date=2020-02-13\n  |url-status=dead\n  }}</ref>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Climate ==\n{{Weather box\n|location = Vernon Hills, Illinois\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high F = 32\n|Feb high F = 36\n|Mar high F = 45\n|Apr high F = 57\n|May high F = 68\n|Jun high F = 78\n|Jul high F = 83\n|Aug high F = 81\n|Sep high F = 74\n|Oct high F = 62\n|Nov high F = 49\n|Dec high F = 36\n|year high F= 58.416\n|Jan low F = 16\n|Feb low F = 19\n|Mar low F = 28\n|Apr low F = 38\n|May low F = 47\n|Jun low F = 57\n|Jul low F = 63\n|Aug low F = 62\n|Sep low F = 54\n|Oct low F = 42\n|Nov low F = 33\n|Dec low F = 20\n|year low F= 36.916\n|source 1 = <ref name=Weather.com>{{cite web |url=https://weather.com/weather/monthly/l/Vernon+Hills+IL+60061:4:US | title=Vernon Hills, IL (60061) Monthly Weather Forecast|publisher=Weather.com |year=2016 |work=Vernon Hills, IL (60061) |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n|date=\n}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{US Census population\n|1960= 123\n|1970= 1056\n|1980= 9827\n|1990= 15319\n|2000= 20120\n|2010= 25113\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=26641\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n[https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/vernonhillsvillageillinois,US/PST045216 Demographics: Quick Facts]\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov |archivedate=September 11, 2013 }}</ref> of 2010, there were 20,120 people, 7,568 households, and 5,312 families residing in the village.

Illinois|Lake County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]. The population was 20,120 at the 2000 census, and 25,113 in 2010. Vernon Hills serves as a retail hub for its surrounding area ([[Libertyville, Illinois|Libertyville]], [[Lake Forest, Illinois|Lake Forest]], [[Long Grove, Illinois|Long Grove]], [[Lincolnshire, Illinois|Lincolnshire]] and [[Buffalo Grove, Illinois|Buffalo Grove]]).\n\n== History ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2012}}\nThe land that was to become Vernon Hills, founded by Richard Theodore Freese, Ron Freese, and Jim Carswell, began with the establishment of a {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm in 1857. Use of the land remained relatively static until the 1960s, when part of it was purchased for a residential community and golf course; the development was the first use of the name \"Vernon Hills.\" On June 16, 1968, the village officially incorporated with 123 residents and 125 houses in a single subdivision built by Quinn Hogan and Barney Loeb.<ref name=\"vernonhills.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vernonhills.org/Index.aspx?NID=108|title=History of Vernon Hills|publisher=Village of Vernon Hills|access-date=April 7, 2017}}</ref> During these times, the village and police department were run from a local motel until 1971 when village trustees bought two portable buildings.<ref name=\"vernonhills.org\"/> It saw steady but slow growth until the annexing of a plot of land near the corner of IL-60 and [[Illinois Route 21|IL-21]] in 1971, which led to the building of {{convert|1200000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Hawthorn Mall|Hawthorn Center]]. By 1980, the village's population had grown to almost 10,000 residents, and by 2000, it had surpassed 20,000.\n\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s, the village grew geographically through the annexation of surrounding areas. This included land that would become the Corporate Woods business park and Centennial Crossing residential development (1986), a {{convert|1200|acre|km2|adj=on}} section of [[Libertyville, Illinois#History|Hawthorne-Mellody Farms]] (1988), and part of the village of [[Half Day, Illinois|Half Day]] (1994). In 2000, the village acquired land that had belonged at different times to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as a [[Project Nike|Nike missile base]], the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] as a naval training center, and the [[Curtiss Candy Company]]; it was converted to what is now the {{convert|184|acre|km2|adj=on}} [http://www.vhparkdistrict.org/parks/vhac/ Vernon Hills Athletic Complex] (VHAC).\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, Vernon Hills has a total area of {{convert|7.917|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|7.71|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 97.39%) is land and {{convert|0.207|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 2.61%) is water.<ref name=\"census-g001\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1777694\n  |title=G001 - Geographic Identifiers - 2010 Census Summary File 1\n  |accessdate=2015-12-25\n  |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]\n  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213082407/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1777694\n  |archive-date=2020-02-13\n  |url-status=dead\n  }}</ref>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Climate ==\n{{Weather box\n|location = Vernon Hills, Illinois\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high F = 32\n|Feb high F = 36\n|Mar high F = 45\n|Apr high F = 57\n|May high F = 68\n|Jun high F = 78\n|Jul high F = 83\n|Aug high F = 81\n|Sep high F = 74\n|Oct high F = 62\n|Nov high F = 49\n|Dec high F = 36\n|year high F= 58.416\n|Jan low F = 16\n|Feb low F = 19\n|Mar low F = 28\n|Apr low F = 38\n|May low F = 47\n|Jun low F = 57\n|Jul low F = 63\n|Aug low F = 62\n|Sep low F = 54\n|Oct low F = 42\n|Nov low F = 33\n|Dec low F = 20\n|year low F= 36.916\n|source 1 = <ref name=Weather.com>{{cite web |url=https://weather.com/weather/monthly/l/Vernon+Hills+IL+60061:4:US | title=Vernon Hills, IL (60061) Monthly Weather Forecast|publisher=Weather.com |year=2016 |work=Vernon Hills, IL (60061) |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n|date=\n}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{US Census population\n|1960= 123\n|1970= 1056\n|1980= 9827\n|1990= 15319\n|2000= 20120\n|2010= 25113\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=26641\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n[https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/vernonhillsvillageillinois,US/PST045216 Demographics: Quick Facts]\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov |archivedate=September 11, 2013 }}</ref> of 2010, there were 20,120 people, 7,568 households, and 5,312 families residing in the village.

The surface is mostly tarmac or artificial turf, with pits for the plane trees and some plots with annual flower plantings. There is a statue to a World War I soldier, the \"Doughboy Statue\", erected in 1921. The process of approval, funding and clearing the tenements that occupied the site was protracted. The park has since been upgraded several times by the [[Works Progress Administration]] and the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].\n\n==Location==\n\nChelsea Park is located between [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|Ninth]] and [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Tenth]] Avenues, and between West 27th and West 28th Streets in Manhattan.{{sfn|Chelsea Park \u2013 NYC Parks}}\nThe park covers almost {{convert|4|acre}}.{{sfn|Edwards and Kelcey Engineers|1989a|p=IV-230}}\nThere is fencing around the park to contain the active play areas, with gates at various points.

The surface is mostly tarmac or artificial turf, with pits for the plane trees and some plots with annual flower plantings. There is a statue to a World War I soldier, the \"Doughboy Statue\", erected in 1921. The process of approval, funding and clearing the tenements that occupied the site was protracted. The park has since been upgraded several times by the [[Works Progress Administration]] and the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].\n\n==Location==\n\nChelsea Park is located between [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|Ninth]] and [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Tenth]] Avenues, and between West 27th and West 28th Streets in Manhattan.{{sfn|Chelsea Park \u2013 NYC Parks}}\nThe park covers almost {{convert|4|acre}}.{{sfn|Edwards and Kelcey Engineers|1989a|p=IV-230}}\nThere is fencing around the park to contain the active play areas, with gates at various points. The soccer pitch is surrounded by taller fencing while the rest of the park is surrounded by shorter fences.{{sfn|Edwards and Kelcey Engineers|1989a|p=IV-230}}\n\nThe area between West 26th and West 28th Streets and 9th and 10th Avenues is a [[City block#Superblock|superblock]], comprising two normal-sized blocks.\nWest 27th Drive is a driveway used only for service access, with the park occupying most of the block to the north of the drive.{{sfn|Edwards and Kelcey Engineers|1989a|p=IV-228}}\nTo the south along 26th Street are three 12-to-14-story brick towers run by the [[New York City Housing Authority]] in the southern part of the superblock, as well as a public school (PS&nbsp;33 Chelsea Prep) and the Hudson Guild Settlement House.{{sfn|Edwards and Kelcey Engineers|1989b|pp=\u25a1-106 to \u25a1-107}}{{sfn|Edwards and Kelcey Engineers|1989a|p=IV-228}}\nThe annex to the [[Morgan General Mail Facility]] occupies the block directly to the north of the park.{{sfn|Edwards and Kelcey Engineers|1989a|p=IV-229}}\nThe [[Church of the Holy Apostles (Manhattan)|Church of the Holy Apostles]], built in 1848, is located on the east side of 9th Avenue across from the park. It is located within the [[Penn South]] housing complex.{{sfn|Edwards and Kelcey Engineers|1989a|p=IV-229}}\n\n==Physical==\n===Infrastructure===\nChelsea Park has spaces for both passive and active recreation.{{sfn|Edwards and Kelcey Engineers|1989a|p=IV-230}}\nIt is one of the busier parks in the neighborhood.{{sfn|Chelsea Park \u2013 NYC Parks}}\nIt contains baseball diamonds, basketball courts and six handball courts.{{sfn|Chelsea Park \u2013 NYC Parks}}\nThe artificial turf sports field covers about one third of the area.{{sfn|Seewagen|2008|p=87}}\nThe P.O. David Willis Basketball Court is named after the [[New York City Police Department]] officer David Willis (1964\u201395), who used to patrol the park.{{sfn|P.O. David Willis Basketball Court}}\nThere are public washrooms at West 27th Street and 9th Avenue, open year-round.{{sfn|Chelsea Park \u2013 NYC Parks}}\nThe park contains a District Health Center, a low-rise red brick building in the eastern part of the park.{{sfn|Edwards and Kelcey Engineers|1989a|p=IV-228}}\n\n===Ecology===\nThere are no artificial or natural ponds.\nAs of 2008 there were 27 mature London plane trees (''[[Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia]]'') with heights of {{convert|15|to|20|m}} around the perimeter of the park, and another 28 similar trees scattered through the interior.\nMost of the trees are in pits, because most of the ground surface is impermeable.\nThe beds of annual plants around the monument and the health center are the only vegetated and permeable areas of the park other than the tree pits.{{sfn|Seewagen|2008|p=87}}\nThe northwest section of the park has less vegetation than the southeast section.{{sfn|Gelb|Delacretaz|2009|p=459}}\n\nThe six-story Morgan Mail Building along the northern perimeter is a high-collision site for birds, with collisions peaking in mid May.{{sfn|Gelb|Delacretaz|2009|p=460}}\nThe first two stories of the building have featureless concrete walls, while the upper four stories are 75% covered with reflective glass panels installed over the concrete wall to give the appearance of windows.{{sfn|Gelb|Delacretaz|2009|p=461}}\nA study in the spring and autumn of 2005 and 2006 collected the corpses of many migratory birds that had collided with the windows of the six-story USPS building, deceived by the reflections of the greenery in the park.{{sfn|Seewagen|2008|p=87}}\nIt seemed that the birds generally had adequate stores of fat (energy), and it was not clear whether they were stopping in Chelsea Park to replenish their energy or as a reaction to the inhospitable and unfamiliar city landscape.{{sfn|Seewagen|2008|p=93}}\nAbout 80% of collisions are fatal, with most collisions occurring during the day.{{sfn|Gelb|Delacretaz|2009|p=462}}\nMost are found along the southeast perimeter, where there are most trees, while relatively few are found along the playing field perimeter.\nThis suggests that the reflections of trees in the glass panels are a major factor.{{sfn|Gelb|Delacretaz|2009|p=463}}\n\n=== Doughboy Statue ===\n[[File:Chelsea Park sketch map.svg|thumb|Sketch map. BB: Baseball diamond; HB: Handball; BSK: Basketball; GP: Gateposts; MO: Monument]]\nThe park is one of nine New York City parks with monuments to local heroes of [[World War I]] (1914\u201318).\nThe Chelsea Park Memorial, also known as the Doughboy Statue, is a granite stele {{convert|14|ft}} tall fronted by a plinth supporting a bronze statue of an American soldier.{{sfn|Chelsea Park Memorial ... NYC Parks}}\n(\"[[Doughboy]]\" is a slang term for an infantryman that was widely used in World War I.{{sfn|Chelsea Park Memorial ... NYC Parks}})\nThe plinth bears the inscription: \"To the Soldiers and Sailors of Chelsea World War 1914\u20131918\".{{sfn|Chelsea Park Memorial ... NYC Parks}}\nThe monument is surrounded by cobblestone.{{sfn|Edwards and Kelcey Engineers|1989a|p=IV-228}}\nIt stands in front of the more recently built Health Center.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2017|p=73}}\n\nThe memorial was designed by the architect [[Charles Rollinson Lamb]] (1860\u20131942).\nThe statue was created by the French-born sculptor [[Philip Martiny]] (1858\u20131927) and cast by the Roman Bronze Works foundry of New York.{{sfn|Chelsea Park Memorial ... NYC Parks}}\nThe soldier holds a rifle and has a flag draped over his shoulders.{{sfn|Chelsea Park Memorial ... NYC Parks}}\nHe strikes a commanding pose, defying the enemy.{{sfn|Wingate|2005|p=38}}\nThe city's Art Commission, chaired by sculptor [[Robert Ingersoll Aitken|Robert Aitken]], rejected Martiny's first submission in which the doughboy's pose was less dynamic.{{sfn|Wingate|2005|p=47}}\nMartiny used the same model for the doughboy as he did for his next statue of a soldier, in [[Greenwich Village]].\nThe soldier's aggressive pose is exactly the same as in Martiny's poster for the propaganda film ''Under Four Flags'' (1918).{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2017|p=73}}\n\n=== Gateposts ===\nAlso in front of the  District Health Center there are two memorial gate posts that were commissioned by the Horatio Seymour Tammany Club and installed in 1926.{{sfn|GIVES TWO GATES TO CITY 1926}}\nThey commemorate the former borough president Frank L Dowling, the municipal civic court leader Frank J. Goodwin and the New York State Democratic Committee member William L. Kavanagh.{{sfn|Frank L. Dowling ... Culture Now}}\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1904\u201318)===\nThe Chelsea Improvement Society proposed a playground for the park's current location in 1904 due to the paucity of parks along Ninth Avenue, with no parks on the street between [[DeWitt Clinton Park]] at 53rd Street and [[St. John's Park|Hudson Park]] at Varick Street.{{sfn|A CHELSEA PLAYGROUND 1904}}\nAt the time, P.S. 33 occupied an adjacent lot.{{sfn|NYC Parks Annual Report|1908|p=150}}\nLand had been set aside for a proposed [[Carnegie library]] to the east.{{sfn|A CHELSEA PLAYGROUND 1904}}\nThe rest of the area was full of [[tenement]]s.{{sfn|Chelsea Park \u2013 NYC Parks}}{{sfn|NYC Parks Annual Report|1908|p=150}}\nOne reader wrote to ''[[The New York Times]]'' opposing the park and advocating another park site further north that would be located near a greater number of people.{{sfn|CHELSEA PARK OPPOSED 1904}}\nAnother reader proposed a larger park.{{sfn|A WEST SIDE PARK 1904}}\nThe legislature passed bills authorizing the park twice, but both times the mayor vetoed the bills as an \"infringement of home rule\".{{sfn|$4,000,000 VOTED FOR PARKS}}\n$2.23 million was set aside to acquire the park in summer 1905.{{sfn|To Hasten Chelsea Park}}\n\nThe city's parks department finally acquired the titles for all the required properties in 1906.{{sfn|NYC Parks Annual Report|1906|p=22}}\nAt the time, the acquisition comprised approximately {{Convert|3.177|acre|ha}}.{{sfn|NYC Parks Annual Report|1906|p=76}}\nDemolitions continued at a slow pace: by July 1907, only two cellars had been cleared.{{sfn|CHELSEA PARK DELAYED}}\nFilling started on the excavated properties by the end of that year.{{sfn|NYC Parks Annual Report|1907|p=56}} \nA temporary playground was built in 1908.{{sfn|NYC Parks Annual Report|1908|p=72}}\nThe first permanent playground in the park was opened in June 1910.{{sfn|NYC Parks Annual Report|1910|pp=26\u201327}}\nBy that time, a baseball field was planned for the park.{{sfn|ALL BARE PLOTS|1910}}\nThe [[New York City Board of Recreation]], which had recently been formed, began to arrange sporting events that drew crowds of spectators.{{sfn|Chelsea Park \u2013 NYC Parks}}\n\n===Interwar period (1919\u201341)===\n\nThe Chelsea Doughboy Statue, which cost $10,000, was donated by the Chelsea Memorial Committee and dedicated on April 7, 1921.{{sfn|Chelsea Park \u2013 NYC Parks}}\nThe decorative gateposts commemorating Dowling, Goodwin, and Kavanagh were installed in 1926.{{sfn|GIVES TWO GATES TO CITY 1926}}\nOn August 18, 1925, a [[water tower]] from a nearby building collapsed on the park, injuring two children.{{sfn|TANK CRASH CAUSES CHELSEA PARK PANIC}}\n\nThe Department of Parks reconstructed a section of the park from 1934 and 1936, and it reopened on June 25, 1936.{{sfn|11 NEW PLAY AREAS WILL OPEN TODAY}}\nIn its announcement advertising the park's reopening, the Department of Parks said, \"\u2026the reconstructed area will have a large play area with one ball field, handball courts, complete play equipment for small children and a wading pool.\"{{sfn|Cruz|2016}}\nA {{convert|60|by|100|ft|m|adj=on}}, $175,000 health center for the middle of the park was proposed in 1935.{{sfn|Health Centre to Cost $175,000}} \nIts cost later grew to $264,000.{{sfn|MAYOR BARS PRAISE FOR HEALTH CENTER}}\nThe Lower West Side Health Center, as it was called, was built as part of the [[Public Works Administration]].{{sfn|MAYOR BARS PRAISE FOR HEALTH CENTER}}\nThe Health Center Building was opened to the public in July 1937.{{sfn|MAYOR BARS PRAISE FOR HEALTH CENTER}}\nIt was in the eastern part of the park and had a public playground on the roof.{{sfn|Cruz|2016}}\nThe Lower West Side Health Center was one of 8 clinics that were opened in the city that year,{{sfn|MAYOR BARS PRAISE FOR HEALTH CENTER}} \nout of a total of 30 health centers that had been proposed for the city.{{sfn|Health Center On West Side To Be Opened}}\nAt the time of its opening, there were 250,000 people living within the health center's service area.{{sfn|Health Center On West Side To Be Opened}}\n\nA proposal to demolish the P.S. 33 building and replace it with an extension of the park was rejected in 1938.{{sfn|BOARD ABANDONS PLAN 1938}} \nThe [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) made further changes to the playground.\nThey added a new area of asphalt in the west of the park, \"graded so that it can be flooded for ice-skating when sub-freezing temperatures permit. In season it will be used for roller skating, roller hockey, softball, basketball and other group games.\"{{sfn|Parks Department Press Releases|1940|p=41 (PDF)}}\nThe WPA also built three [[basketball]] courts, three [[handball]] courts, two courts for pitching [[horseshoes]], and one for [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]].{{sfn|Cruz|2016}}{{sfn|Parks Department Press Releases|1940|p=41 (PDF)}}\nThis replaced the single baseball diamond that had formerly occupied that portion of the park.{{sfn|MAYOR REDEDICATES CHELSEA PLAYGROUND}}\nThe 1940 restoration added floodlights to the softball diamonds.{{sfn|P.O.

It has a total land area of 11,163 hectares (8.13% of Bataan). It borders [[Pilar, Bataan|Pilar]] to the south, [[Abucay, Bataan|Abucay]] to the north, [[Morong, Bataan|Morong]] to the west, and [[Manila Bay]] to the east.\n\n==History==\n[[File: Poblacion Balanga City.jpg|thumbnail|left|Paterno St. in Barangay Poblacion, Balanga City, during the 1970s]]\nBalanga, the capital of Bataan, was formerly a village of Abucay before it was established as a mission of the [[Dominican Order]] in the Provincial Charter of April 21, 1714, and later declared a vicariate on April 18, 1739, under the patronage of Saint Joseph. Upon the establishment of Bataan as a separate province in 1754, Balanga was made its capital by General Pedro Manuel Arandia due to its favorable location, at the heart of the new territorial jurisdiction.\n\nThe word Balanga originates from the Kapampangan word \"bala\u00f1ga\" (clay pot, or \"bang\" in Tagalog), which the town used to produce and which were among the best that can be found in the country.\n\nOn December 30, 2000, Balanga was inaugurated as a City by the Republic Act 8984 authored by Congressman [[Tet Garcia|Enrique \"Tet\" Garcia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofbalanga.gov.ph/city-profile/|title=City Profile \u2013 City of Balanga|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe city has extended its urban fringe to the west of Roman Superhighway and a new growth center in Barangay Tuyo has been delineated in the Comprehensive Land Use Plan. During the past years, the city saw a high record of residential growth. Consequently, with the expansion of the physical limits of the urban core, as well as the expected large increases in population, and the city's attractiveness to commercial and employment activities, the City Government of Balanga decided to undertake a Master Planning exercise and to propose various developmental projects that would establish Balanga as a well-planned community with quality and character that is innovative and special, although this is currently hindered by an unreliable electricity supply.<ref>[http://www.nscb.gov.ph/factsheet/pdf01/fs1_01.asp NSCB \u2013 2001 Factsheet \u2013 12 New Cities Created], July\u2013December 2000.</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Balanga City\n| 1903 = 7347\n| 1918 = 8275\n| 1939 = 11684\n| 1948 = 12379\n| 1960 = 18143\n| 1970 = 28484\n| 1975 = 34289\n| 1980 = 39132\n| 1990 = 51512\n| 1995 = 60912\n| 2000 = 71088\n| 2007 = 84105\n| 2010 = 87920\n| 2015 = 96061\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nThe population of Balanga in the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}} was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==City government and politics==\nPursuant to the [[Local government in the Philippines]]\",<ref name=\"constitution:\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/aboutphil/a10.asp|title=Philippines : Gov.Ph : About the Philippines\n| publisher = www.gov.ph|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/localgov.htm|title=THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES - CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|website=www.chanrobles.com}}</ref> the political seat of the municipal government is located at the City Hall.

Upon the establishment of Bataan as a separate province in 1754, Balanga was made its capital by General Pedro Manuel Arandia due to its favorable location, at the heart of the new territorial jurisdiction.\n\nThe word Balanga originates from the Kapampangan word \"bala\u00f1ga\" (clay pot, or \"bang\" in Tagalog), which the town used to produce and which were among the best that can be found in the country.\n\nOn December 30, 2000, Balanga was inaugurated as a City by the Republic Act 8984 authored by Congressman [[Tet Garcia|Enrique \"Tet\" Garcia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofbalanga.gov.ph/city-profile/|title=City Profile \u2013 City of Balanga|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe city has extended its urban fringe to the west of Roman Superhighway and a new growth center in Barangay Tuyo has been delineated in the Comprehensive Land Use Plan. During the past years, the city saw a high record of residential growth. Consequently, with the expansion of the physical limits of the urban core, as well as the expected large increases in population, and the city's attractiveness to commercial and employment activities, the City Government of Balanga decided to undertake a Master Planning exercise and to propose various developmental projects that would establish Balanga as a well-planned community with quality and character that is innovative and special, although this is currently hindered by an unreliable electricity supply.<ref>[http://www.nscb.gov.ph/factsheet/pdf01/fs1_01.asp NSCB \u2013 2001 Factsheet \u2013 12 New Cities Created], July\u2013December 2000.</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Balanga City\n| 1903 = 7347\n| 1918 = 8275\n| 1939 = 11684\n| 1948 = 12379\n| 1960 = 18143\n| 1970 = 28484\n| 1975 = 34289\n| 1980 = 39132\n| 1990 = 51512\n| 1995 = 60912\n| 2000 = 71088\n| 2007 = 84105\n| 2010 = 87920\n| 2015 = 96061\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nThe population of Balanga in the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}} was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==City government and politics==\nPursuant to the [[Local government in the Philippines]]\",<ref name=\"constitution:\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/aboutphil/a10.asp|title=Philippines : Gov.Ph : About the Philippines\n| publisher = www.gov.ph|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/localgov.htm|title=THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES - CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|website=www.chanrobles.com}}</ref> the political seat of the municipal government is located at the City Hall.

He made his first on-screen appearance on 10 November 2003. The character is named after the singer, [[Chesney Hawkes]].\n\nChesney is the younger brother of [[Fiz Brown]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) and son of [[Cilla Battersby-Brown]] ([[Wendi Peters]]). He is also a father of 5 (2 girls, 3 boys) and engaged to [[Gemma Winter]]. Chesney's storylines have included: his friendship with pet dog Schmeichel and coming to terms with the loss of his beloved pet, as well as his relationship with [[Katy Armstrong]] ([[Georgia May Foote]]) who later went on to give birth to his son [[Joseph Brown (Coronation Street)|Joseph]] aged just seventeen. Chesney later began a relationship with [[Sinead Tinker]] ([[Katie McGlynn]]) in 2013 and was stabbed with a glass bottle during an incident at Nick's Bistro in 2017. Within days of the incident, he made a full recovery.\n\n==Storylines==\nChesney is the younger brother of [[Fiz Brown]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) and son of [[Cilla Battersby-Brown]] ([[Wendi Peters]]). Chesney soon bonds with Cilla's boyfriend [[Les Battersby]] ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]), and also gets on well with Fiz's then-boyfriend [[Kirk Sutherland|Kirk]] ([[Andrew Whyment]]) who is also a lodger with Les and Cilla. In 2004, [[Rita Sullivan]] ([[Barbara Knox]]) clips Chesney around the ear for repeatedly stealing sweets from her shop; Chesney falls against some shelving and is slightly hurt. When Cilla learns of the incident, she spots an opportunity for compensation. The Battersby-Browns take Chesney to hospital, with Cilla prompting her son to complain of fake symptoms so that he will be diagnosed with concussion. Rita is arrested and charged with assaulting a minor and Cilla coaches Chesney into giving the 'right' answers; Rita is ordered to pay \u00a3500 in damages to the family and \u00a3500 in court fees. Disappointed with the court payment, Cilla seeks a \u00a33,000 out of court settlement. Rita puts the Kabin on the market and prepares to leave the area, but Les talks Cilla out of any further action. Rita bears no ill will against Chesney, later employing him to do a paper round. Chesney attempts to run away after his mum leaves without him, but Les takes him back in. He is given a pure breed [[Great Dane]] dog, which he names Schmeichel after footballer [[Peter Schmeichel]], by the Duckworths. He also befriends [[Sophie Webster]] ([[Brooke Vincent]]). Later that year, Cilla starts to abuse Chesney, such as threatening to hit him if he tells Les about her affairs and also running away with him as she taunts him that no-one loves him. Eventually, Cilla is good to Chesney.\n\nIn 2005, he cons several residents at [[Easter]] into giving him Easter eggs. That August, Schmeichel is run over by a bus driven by [[Claire Peacock]] ([[Julia Haworth]]), leaving Chesney devastated, but the dog survives. Chesney accidentally walks in on [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]) when she is in the shower, and Les tells everyone about the incident, threatening his friendship with Sophie. In 2006, Chesney is saddened at the news that his mum has cancer, but refuses to go on a holiday with her when he finds out she has lied about the seriousness of her condition. In January 2007, when Cilla returns, Chesney begins to feel unwelcome. In May, Les leaves Weatherfield to work as a roadie and  has little subsequent contact with Chesney. By October 2007, Cilla also chooses to leave Weatherfield for Las Vegas because she has come into money. Not wanting to take Chesney with her, she gives him \u00a31,000. He spends a third of his money on an Xbox 360, angering Fiz who has been left with nothing. In March 2008, Chesney learns that Les isn't returning, and he is taken to a foster home because Kirk cannot take care of him properly. Claire later reveals that she reported them to the Social Services, in Chesney's best interests. Chesney is allowed to return home after Fiz agrees to move into Number 5, though with much reluctance, as Kirk, now her ex-boyfriend, is still living there. Later, Chesney is dismayed to see the return of Fiz's ex-boyfriend [[John Stape]] ([[Graeme Hawley]]), who had cheated on her. John buys Chesney a bike for his birthday which he rejects when he finds out who it has come from. In a fit of rage, Chesney breaks the wing mirror on John's taxi.\n\nOn Chesney's fourteenth birthday, he received a postcard from Cilla and Les.  They invite Chesney and Kirk to join them in [[Sun City, North West]]. Kirk and Chesney agree to go, but Fiz is dismayed. When they arrived at the airport, they found out that 'Les' was not their Les, but a South African fraudster named Lesedi. Cilla revealed that she had placed their names in a competition to win the \"South African sunshine family\" award and had got to the final, with a chance to win half a million South African dollars. Cilla pleads with Fiz to join them. Fiz confronts Cilla about her scheme, but Chesney believes that Cilla will 'return' to Weatherfield if they win, so Fiz agrees to help. The family get stuck in a bush surrounded by lions but are saved by Kirk. At the awards ceremony, Chesney reveals that he is not really disabled and the Battersbys are disqualified. Later, Chesney is horrified to find out that Fiz has been consulting John Stape about his education, and regularly visiting him in prison. This leads to a falling out between the pair, as Chesney is angry that his sister cares more about John than she does him. Chesney later finds out that Fiz and John are engaged and, in a fit of rage, he steals Fiz's engagement ring and crashes Rosie Webster's new car, nearly running over [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) in the process. Chesney relents and attends John and Fiz's wedding.\n\nIn 2010, Chesney meets [[Katy Armstrong]] ([[Georgia May Foote]]) and is instantly attracted to her. Katy's father, [[Owen Armstrong]] ([[Ian Puleston-Davies]]) does not approve of their relationship and threatens Chesney. In December 2010, Fiz goes into labour, three months early as a result of the shock of the tram crash, with Chesney's support; Fiz gives birth to a baby girl, and names her Hope. In early-2011, Hope is diagnosed with a heart condition, but is successfully treated for the problem. Chesney comforts Fiz when John goes into hospital after a breakdown. In March 2011, when Hope comes home, Fiz tells Chesney he will have to get rid of Schmeichel, so he and Katy move out, and Katy suggests they have a baby of their own. While cooking dinner for Chesney, Katy tells an estatic Chesney that she is pregnant with his baby, and they decide to keep her pregnancy a secret. Chesney begins to grow suspicious of [[John Stape]], so goes to see [[Charlotte Hoyle]]'s ([[Becky Hindley]]) parents, who tell him that John (who they believe is Colin) was engaged to Charlotte and made the decision to switch her life support machine off. He confronts John, who denies any involvement in Charlotte's death and [[Joy Fishwick]]'s ([[Doreen Mantle]]) suspicious death. John, realising that Chesney is starting to work out the truth, takes him to The Hoyles' house where he is holding them hostage in the cellar; before Chesney can run away, John ties him up too. John tells Katy that Chesney has run away, but Chesney manages to untie himself and the Hoyles a few days later, breaking the bar to which they were tied. Unknown to them, John has dug up the body of [[Colin Fishwick]] ([[David Crellin]]), which he buried a few months earlier. Chesney escapes after his sister, Fiz, works out the truth about John and follows him to the Hoyles' house; she tells a horrified Chesney that Katy is about to have an [[abortion]], and Chesney arrives just in time to prevent this. The police arrest John, who attacks [[Maria Connor]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]) while she is looking after Hope. In November 2011, Schmeichel is diagnosed with liver cancer, and the vets say he has no choice but to put Schmeichel to sleep. On 23 December 2011, Chesney finds out from his Fiz that Katy has gone into labour at the nativity play, so Anna Windass has to deliver the baby. Chesney was stranded in the middle of nowhere with [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) after they had cut down some Christmas trees to be delivered. After stealing some unlocked bicycles, Chesney manages to make it in time to see the birth of his son, who they name Joseph Peter; Joseph because he was born at the nativity play, and Peter in honour of Schmeichel.\n\nIn 2012, Katy begins to struggle with looking after Joseph and keeps abandoning him. On one occasion, Chesney returns home just after Katy rushes back. After talking things through, Chesney says that Katy is a good mum and should stay. In August, Katy's sister, [[Izzy Armstrong|Izzy]] ([[Cherylee Houston]]), has a miscarriage, so Katy wants to be a surrogate mother. This upsets Chesney, who almost falls out with the Armstrong family. Chesney ends his relationship with Katy when she has an affair with [[Ryan Connor]] ([[Sol Heras]]). Katy moves in with Ryan, taking Joseph with her. Chesney begins dating [[Sinead Tinker]] ([[Katie McGlynn]]), but she ends their relationship when she realises that he still loves Katy. Katy leaves Ryan and attempts to reunite with Chesney, but he says he cannot forgive her. Sinead and Chesney resume their relationship. When Fiz moves in with Tyrone, Sinead starts to spend more time in the house with him. Chesney has to give up his market stall when his uninsured stock is stolen, but Dev Alahan gives him the job of  manager at his kebab shop. Sinead later moves in with Chesney and they are joined by her Aunt Beth, partner Kirk and her cousin Craig. shortly afterwards. When Beth attacks a man who was trying to mug her friend from bingo, she receives a \u00a35,000 reward, and takes the family to [[Mexico]] for two weeks.\n\nCilla returns to the street and she tells Chesney and Fiz that she has a serious illness, but leaves when she fails to get Chesney's support. In 2015, Chesney discovers Sinead has been in a minibus crash with several other residents, including [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]), who was responsible for the accident. Chesney blames Steve for Sinead's injuries, but she slowly recovers in hospital. Chesney finds out that Katy plans to move to [[Portugal]] with Joseph, and threatens to seek custody, but Katy reconsiders her options. Feeling guilty, Chesney lets Katy take Joseph to [[Portugal]] with her, so that he can have a new, but different life.\n\nIn 2017, Katy dies off-screen in a car accident in Portugal, and Chesney flies out there to bring Joseph home to Weatherfield.\n\nIn January 2018, Chesney's nerves take the better of him at the altar on his wedding day to Sinead Tinker, and he announces he can't marry her, despite the fact both he and son Joseph love her very much. Sinead leaves the wedding, devastated.\n\nLater in the same year, he embarks on relationships with both hairdresser [[Emma Brooker]] (Alexandra Mardell), and Prima Doner colleague [[Gemma Winter]] (Dolly-Rose Campbell). Despite the fact he only hooked up with Emma to make Gemma jealous, Emma developed genuine feelings for him and was gutted.\n\n==Creation==\n[[Sam Aston]] was chosen to play Chesney after training at a local drama group, Carl Godby's Theatre Workshop.  It was revealed by producers that he was named after 1990s icon [[Chesney Hawkes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/Soaps/coronationstreet/castandcharacters/atoe/ChesneyBattersbyBrown1.html|title=Chesney Battersby-Brown|publisher=[[itv.com]]|date=2007-04-16|accessdate=2009-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928020558/http://www.itv.com/Soaps/coronationstreet/castandcharacters/atoe/ChesneyBattersbyBrown1.html|archive-date=28 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/coronation_street/whos_who/chesney_battersby_brown|title=Chesney Battersby-Brown|publisher=[[What's On TV]]|accessdate=2009-02-14}}</ref>\n\nAston's siblings have also appeared in the show his sister Emily Aston played [[Becky Palmer]] from 1996 till 1997 and his brother Joseph Aston played [[Tommy Duckworth]] in 2000.\n\nWhile his upbringing was not as traumatic as Fiz's early years, Chesney was often left home alone and had to put up with the many \"uncles\" Cilla brought to their flat. Chesney found some stability with [[Les Battersby]] ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]), but Les abandoned the family after a few years, with Cilla soon following. An increasingly bitter Chesney was left to be taken care of by Fiz, but her relationship problems often overshadowed her duties as guardian.\n\n==Development==\nIn July 2010, it was announced that Chesney will hook up with newcomer [[Katy Armstrong]] (Georgia May Foote) in a storyline which will involve the 17-year-old losing his virginity. A spokesperson for ''Coronation Street'' said \"We have all seen Chesney grow up so it\u2019s going to be a huge milestone for him and the viewers. We all remember that sweet little kid who first arrived in the Street with his mum Cilla. But that was seven years ago and he\u2019s about to become a man.

Katy (Georgia May Foote) will make the suggestion of starting a family to Chesney in the weeks ahead - leaving him shocked as he believes they are too young for parenthood. However, after Katy continues to push the idea, Chesney (Sam Aston) is expected to change his mind and begin looking for a flat that he can rent with his girlfriend. Discussing Fiz's reaction, a ''Coronation Street'' source said \"After just having a child herself she knows how hard it is. She doesn't want him ruining his life by becoming a dad when he's still a kid.\" \nBut they have a baby boy called Joseph anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a302629/baby-storyline-for-teen-corrie-couple.html|title=Baby storyline for teen Corrie couple|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=February 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2011, it was revealed that Chesney's dog Schmeichel would be put to sleep in an upcoming storyline. \"It will be heartbreaking for Chesney - and for viewers,\" a Corrie source told ''[[The Sunday Mirror]]''. \"But bosses think the time is right for Schmeichel to leave the show.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a338592/coronation-street-chesney-heartbroken-by-death-of-loved-one.html#~p7t6MbwxTkmDAo|title='Coronation Street' Chesney 'heartbroken' by death of loved one|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Daniel|last=Sperling|date=September 4, 2011}}</ref> In response to complaints about Schmeichel's fate, a Coronation Street spokesperson told The Mirror: \"Great Danes do not live forever and the storyline has been decided upon.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/scoop/a338698/coronation-street-schmeichel-death-latest-update.html#~p7t6wrsmOlzRpW|title='Coronation Street' Schmeichel death: Latest update|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=September 5, 2011}}</ref> Speaking to Soaplife, Aston admitted that he will miss scenes alongside the Great Dane. He explained: \"Having his beloved dog put to sleep is not an option Chesney is willing to consider.

He would go thousands of pounds into debt if he has to.\" Paying tribute to Schmeichel, Aston added: \"I will [miss him]; he has been such a massive part of Chesney's character.

He made his first on-screen appearance on 10 November 2003. The character is named after the singer, [[Chesney Hawkes]].\n\nChesney is the younger brother of [[Fiz Brown]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) and son of [[Cilla Battersby-Brown]] ([[Wendi Peters]]). He is also a father of 5 (2 girls, 3 boys) and engaged to [[Gemma Winter]]. Chesney's storylines have included: his friendship with pet dog Schmeichel and coming to terms with the loss of his beloved pet, as well as his relationship with [[Katy Armstrong]] ([[Georgia May Foote]]) who later went on to give birth to his son [[Joseph Brown (Coronation Street)|Joseph]] aged just seventeen. Chesney later began a relationship with [[Sinead Tinker]] ([[Katie McGlynn]]) in 2013 and was stabbed with a glass bottle during an incident at Nick's Bistro in 2017. Within days of the incident, he made a full recovery.\n\n==Storylines==\nChesney is the younger brother of [[Fiz Brown]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) and son of [[Cilla Battersby-Brown]] ([[Wendi Peters]]). Chesney soon bonds with Cilla's boyfriend [[Les Battersby]] ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]), and also gets on well with Fiz's then-boyfriend [[Kirk Sutherland|Kirk]] ([[Andrew Whyment]]) who is also a lodger with Les and Cilla. In 2004, [[Rita Sullivan]] ([[Barbara Knox]]) clips Chesney around the ear for repeatedly stealing sweets from her shop; Chesney falls against some shelving and is slightly hurt. When Cilla learns of the incident, she spots an opportunity for compensation. The Battersby-Browns take Chesney to hospital, with Cilla prompting her son to complain of fake symptoms so that he will be diagnosed with concussion. Rita is arrested and charged with assaulting a minor and Cilla coaches Chesney into giving the 'right' answers; Rita is ordered to pay \u00a3500 in damages to the family and \u00a3500 in court fees. Disappointed with the court payment, Cilla seeks a \u00a33,000 out of court settlement. Rita puts the Kabin on the market and prepares to leave the area, but Les talks Cilla out of any further action. Rita bears no ill will against Chesney, later employing him to do a paper round. Chesney attempts to run away after his mum leaves without him, but Les takes him back in. He is given a pure breed [[Great Dane]] dog, which he names Schmeichel after footballer [[Peter Schmeichel]], by the Duckworths. He also befriends [[Sophie Webster]] ([[Brooke Vincent]]). Later that year, Cilla starts to abuse Chesney, such as threatening to hit him if he tells Les about her affairs and also running away with him as she taunts him that no-one loves him. Eventually, Cilla is good to Chesney.\n\nIn 2005, he cons several residents at [[Easter]] into giving him Easter eggs. That August, Schmeichel is run over by a bus driven by [[Claire Peacock]] ([[Julia Haworth]]), leaving Chesney devastated, but the dog survives. Chesney accidentally walks in on [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]) when she is in the shower, and Les tells everyone about the incident, threatening his friendship with Sophie. In 2006, Chesney is saddened at the news that his mum has cancer, but refuses to go on a holiday with her when he finds out she has lied about the seriousness of her condition. In January 2007, when Cilla returns, Chesney begins to feel unwelcome. In May, Les leaves Weatherfield to work as a roadie and  has little subsequent contact with Chesney. By October 2007, Cilla also chooses to leave Weatherfield for Las Vegas because she has come into money. Not wanting to take Chesney with her, she gives him \u00a31,000. He spends a third of his money on an Xbox 360, angering Fiz who has been left with nothing. In March 2008, Chesney learns that Les isn't returning, and he is taken to a foster home because Kirk cannot take care of him properly. Claire later reveals that she reported them to the Social Services, in Chesney's best interests. Chesney is allowed to return home after Fiz agrees to move into Number 5, though with much reluctance, as Kirk, now her ex-boyfriend, is still living there. Later, Chesney is dismayed to see the return of Fiz's ex-boyfriend [[John Stape]] ([[Graeme Hawley]]), who had cheated on her. John buys Chesney a bike for his birthday which he rejects when he finds out who it has come from. In a fit of rage, Chesney breaks the wing mirror on John's taxi.\n\nOn Chesney's fourteenth birthday, he received a postcard from Cilla and Les.  They invite Chesney and Kirk to join them in [[Sun City, North West]]. Kirk and Chesney agree to go, but Fiz is dismayed. When they arrived at the airport, they found out that 'Les' was not their Les, but a South African fraudster named Lesedi. Cilla revealed that she had placed their names in a competition to win the \"South African sunshine family\" award and had got to the final, with a chance to win half a million South African dollars. Cilla pleads with Fiz to join them. Fiz confronts Cilla about her scheme, but Chesney believes that Cilla will 'return' to Weatherfield if they win, so Fiz agrees to help. The family get stuck in a bush surrounded by lions but are saved by Kirk. At the awards ceremony, Chesney reveals that he is not really disabled and the Battersbys are disqualified. Later, Chesney is horrified to find out that Fiz has been consulting John Stape about his education, and regularly visiting him in prison. This leads to a falling out between the pair, as Chesney is angry that his sister cares more about John than she does him. Chesney later finds out that Fiz and John are engaged and, in a fit of rage, he steals Fiz's engagement ring and crashes Rosie Webster's new car, nearly running over [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) in the process. Chesney relents and attends John and Fiz's wedding.\n\nIn 2010, Chesney meets [[Katy Armstrong]] ([[Georgia May Foote]]) and is instantly attracted to her. Katy's father, [[Owen Armstrong]] ([[Ian Puleston-Davies]]) does not approve of their relationship and threatens Chesney. In December 2010, Fiz goes into labour, three months early as a result of the shock of the tram crash, with Chesney's support; Fiz gives birth to a baby girl, and names her Hope. In early-2011, Hope is diagnosed with a heart condition, but is successfully treated for the problem. Chesney comforts Fiz when John goes into hospital after a breakdown. In March 2011, when Hope comes home, Fiz tells Chesney he will have to get rid of Schmeichel, so he and Katy move out, and Katy suggests they have a baby of their own. While cooking dinner for Chesney, Katy tells an estatic Chesney that she is pregnant with his baby, and they decide to keep her pregnancy a secret. Chesney begins to grow suspicious of [[John Stape]], so goes to see [[Charlotte Hoyle]]'s ([[Becky Hindley]]) parents, who tell him that John (who they believe is Colin) was engaged to Charlotte and made the decision to switch her life support machine off. He confronts John, who denies any involvement in Charlotte's death and [[Joy Fishwick]]'s ([[Doreen Mantle]]) suspicious death. John, realising that Chesney is starting to work out the truth, takes him to The Hoyles' house where he is holding them hostage in the cellar; before Chesney can run away, John ties him up too. John tells Katy that Chesney has run away, but Chesney manages to untie himself and the Hoyles a few days later, breaking the bar to which they were tied. Unknown to them, John has dug up the body of [[Colin Fishwick]] ([[David Crellin]]), which he buried a few months earlier. Chesney escapes after his sister, Fiz, works out the truth about John and follows him to the Hoyles' house; she tells a horrified Chesney that Katy is about to have an [[abortion]], and Chesney arrives just in time to prevent this. The police arrest John, who attacks [[Maria Connor]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]) while she is looking after Hope. In November 2011, Schmeichel is diagnosed with liver cancer, and the vets say he has no choice but to put Schmeichel to sleep. On 23 December 2011, Chesney finds out from his Fiz that Katy has gone into labour at the nativity play, so Anna Windass has to deliver the baby. Chesney was stranded in the middle of nowhere with [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) after they had cut down some Christmas trees to be delivered. After stealing some unlocked bicycles, Chesney manages to make it in time to see the birth of his son, who they name Joseph Peter; Joseph because he was born at the nativity play, and Peter in honour of Schmeichel.\n\nIn 2012, Katy begins to struggle with looking after Joseph and keeps abandoning him. On one occasion, Chesney returns home just after Katy rushes back. After talking things through, Chesney says that Katy is a good mum and should stay. In August, Katy's sister, [[Izzy Armstrong|Izzy]] ([[Cherylee Houston]]), has a miscarriage, so Katy wants to be a surrogate mother. This upsets Chesney, who almost falls out with the Armstrong family. Chesney ends his relationship with Katy when she has an affair with [[Ryan Connor]] ([[Sol Heras]]). Katy moves in with Ryan, taking Joseph with her. Chesney begins dating [[Sinead Tinker]] ([[Katie McGlynn]]), but she ends their relationship when she realises that he still loves Katy. Katy leaves Ryan and attempts to reunite with Chesney, but he says he cannot forgive her. Sinead and Chesney resume their relationship. When Fiz moves in with Tyrone, Sinead starts to spend more time in the house with him. Chesney has to give up his market stall when his uninsured stock is stolen, but Dev Alahan gives him the job of  manager at his kebab shop. Sinead later moves in with Chesney and they are joined by her Aunt Beth, partner Kirk and her cousin Craig. shortly afterwards. When Beth attacks a man who was trying to mug her friend from bingo, she receives a \u00a35,000 reward, and takes the family to [[Mexico]] for two weeks.\n\nCilla returns to the street and she tells Chesney and Fiz that she has a serious illness, but leaves when she fails to get Chesney's support. In 2015, Chesney discovers Sinead has been in a minibus crash with several other residents, including [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]), who was responsible for the accident. Chesney blames Steve for Sinead's injuries, but she slowly recovers in hospital. Chesney finds out that Katy plans to move to [[Portugal]] with Joseph, and threatens to seek custody, but Katy reconsiders her options. Feeling guilty, Chesney lets Katy take Joseph to [[Portugal]] with her, so that he can have a new, but different life.\n\nIn 2017, Katy dies off-screen in a car accident in Portugal, and Chesney flies out there to bring Joseph home to Weatherfield.\n\nIn January 2018, Chesney's nerves take the better of him at the altar on his wedding day to Sinead Tinker, and he announces he can't marry her, despite the fact both he and son Joseph love her very much. Sinead leaves the wedding, devastated.\n\nLater in the same year, he embarks on relationships with both hairdresser [[Emma Brooker]] (Alexandra Mardell), and Prima Doner colleague [[Gemma Winter]] (Dolly-Rose Campbell). Despite the fact he only hooked up with Emma to make Gemma jealous, Emma developed genuine feelings for him and was gutted.\n\n==Creation==\n[[Sam Aston]] was chosen to play Chesney after training at a local drama group, Carl Godby's Theatre Workshop.  It was revealed by producers that he was named after 1990s icon [[Chesney Hawkes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/Soaps/coronationstreet/castandcharacters/atoe/ChesneyBattersbyBrown1.html|title=Chesney Battersby-Brown|publisher=[[itv.com]]|date=2007-04-16|accessdate=2009-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928020558/http://www.itv.com/Soaps/coronationstreet/castandcharacters/atoe/ChesneyBattersbyBrown1.html|archive-date=28 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/coronation_street/whos_who/chesney_battersby_brown|title=Chesney Battersby-Brown|publisher=[[What's On TV]]|accessdate=2009-02-14}}</ref>\n\nAston's siblings have also appeared in the show his sister Emily Aston played [[Becky Palmer]] from 1996 till 1997 and his brother Joseph Aston played [[Tommy Duckworth]] in 2000.\n\nWhile his upbringing was not as traumatic as Fiz's early years, Chesney was often left home alone and had to put up with the many \"uncles\" Cilla brought to their flat. Chesney found some stability with [[Les Battersby]] ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]), but Les abandoned the family after a few years, with Cilla soon following. An increasingly bitter Chesney was left to be taken care of by Fiz, but her relationship problems often overshadowed her duties as guardian.\n\n==Development==\nIn July 2010, it was announced that Chesney will hook up with newcomer [[Katy Armstrong]] (Georgia May Foote) in a storyline which will involve the 17-year-old losing his virginity. A spokesperson for ''Coronation Street'' said \"We have all seen Chesney grow up so it\u2019s going to be a huge milestone for him and the viewers. We all remember that sweet little kid who first arrived in the Street with his mum Cilla. But that was seven years ago and he\u2019s about to become a man.

Katy (Georgia May Foote) will make the suggestion of starting a family to Chesney in the weeks ahead - leaving him shocked as he believes they are too young for parenthood. However, after Katy continues to push the idea, Chesney (Sam Aston) is expected to change his mind and begin looking for a flat that he can rent with his girlfriend. Discussing Fiz's reaction, a ''Coronation Street'' source said \"After just having a child herself she knows how hard it is. She doesn't want him ruining his life by becoming a dad when he's still a kid.\" \nBut they have a baby boy called Joseph anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a302629/baby-storyline-for-teen-corrie-couple.html|title=Baby storyline for teen Corrie couple|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=February 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2011, it was revealed that Chesney's dog Schmeichel would be put to sleep in an upcoming storyline. \"It will be heartbreaking for Chesney - and for viewers,\" a Corrie source told ''[[The Sunday Mirror]]''. \"But bosses think the time is right for Schmeichel to leave the show.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a338592/coronation-street-chesney-heartbroken-by-death-of-loved-one.html#~p7t6MbwxTkmDAo|title='Coronation Street' Chesney 'heartbroken' by death of loved one|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Daniel|last=Sperling|date=September 4, 2011}}</ref> In response to complaints about Schmeichel's fate, a Coronation Street spokesperson told The Mirror: \"Great Danes do not live forever and the storyline has been decided upon.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/scoop/a338698/coronation-street-schmeichel-death-latest-update.html#~p7t6wrsmOlzRpW|title='Coronation Street' Schmeichel death: Latest update|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=September 5, 2011}}</ref> Speaking to Soaplife, Aston admitted that he will miss scenes alongside the Great Dane. He explained: \"Having his beloved dog put to sleep is not an option Chesney is willing to consider. Schmeichel has always been there for him; when Cilla, Les and even Fiz let him down, Schmeichel was always there. Chesney would do anything it takes to help out his faithful pal. He would go thousands of pounds into debt if he has to.\" Paying tribute to Schmeichel, Aston added: \"I will [miss him]; he has been such a massive part of Chesney's character.

Several rooms in the palace are regularly open to the public except during state functions. An admission fee of \u20ac13 is required, however some days it is free.\n\nThe palace is located on the site of a 9th-century [[Alc\u00e1zar]]  (\"Muslim-era fortress\"), near the town of Magerit, constructed as an outpost by [[Muhammad I of C\u00f3rdoba]]{{sfn|Viso|2014|p=7}} and inherited after 1036 by the independent [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Taifa of Toledo]].

In 1329, [[Alfonso XI of Castile|King Alfonso XI of Castile]] convened the ''cortes'' of Madrid for the first time. [[Felipe II of Spain|King Felipe II]] moved his court to Madrid in 1561.\n\nThe old ''[[Royal Alcazar of Madrid|Alc\u00e1zar]]'' was built on the location in the 16th century. After it burned 24 December 1734, [[Felipe V of Spain|King Felipe V]] ordered a new palace built on the same site. Construction spanned the years 1738 to 1755<ref name=\"patromonio\">{{cite web |url=http://www.patrimonionacional.es/Home/Palacios-Reales/Palacio-Real-de-Madrid.aspx |title=Palacio Real de Madrid |work=[[Patrimonio Nacional]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112062553/http://www.patrimonionacional.es/Home/Palacios-Reales/Palacio-Real-de-Madrid.aspx |archive-date=12 January 2013 |access-date=23 June 2019 |language=es}}</ref> and followed a [[Bernini]]esque design by [[Filippo Juvarra]] and Giovanni Battista Sacchetti in cooperation with [[Ventura Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Francesco Sabatini]], and [[Mart\u00edn Sarmiento]]. [[Carlos III of Spain|King Carlos III]] first occupied the new palace in 1764.\n\nThe last monarch who lived continuously in the palace was [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]], although [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]], president of the [[Spanish Second Republic|Second Republic]], also inhabited it, making him the last head of state to do so. During that period the palace was known as \"Palacio Nacional\". There is still a room next to the Real Capilla, which is known by the name \"Office of Aza\u00f1a\".\n\nThe interior of the palace is notable for its wealth of art and the use of many types of fine materials in the construction and the decoration of its rooms. It includes paintings by artists such as [[Caravaggio]], [[Juan de Flandes]], [[Francisco de Goya]], and [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]], and frescoes by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], [[Corrado Giaquinto]], and [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]. Other collections of great historical and artistic importance preserved in the building include the [[Royal Armoury of Madrid]], porcelain, watches, furniture, silverware, and the world's only complete [[Stradivarius]] string quintet.\n\n== History of the building ==\n{{See also|Royal Alcazar of Madrid|Project of Filippo Juvarra for the Royal Palace of Madrid}}\n[[File:Evoluci\u00f3n Alc\u00e1zar de Madrid.png|right|thumb|220px|Historical evolution of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid.]]\n\nThe palace was initially built by Muhammad I, [[Umayyad]] [[Emirate of Cordoba|Emir]] of [[Caliphate of Cordoba|Cordoba]], between 860 and 880. After the Moors were driven out of Toledo in the 11th century, the castle retained its defensive function. [[Henry III of Castile]] added several towers. His son [[John II of Castile|John II]] used it as a royal residence.{{sfn|Viso|2014|p=7}} During the [[War of the Castilian Succession]] (1476) the troops of [[Joanna la Beltraneja]] were besieged in the Alc\u00e1zar, during which the building suffered severe damage.\n\nThe only drawing of the castle from the [[Middle Ages]] is one from 1534 by Cornelius Vermeyen.{{sfn|Viso|2014|p=7}}\n\nEmperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], with the architects [[Alonso de Covarrubias]] and [[Luis de Vega]], extended and renovated the castle in 1537. [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] made Madrid his capital in 1561 and continued the renovations, with new additions. [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] added a long southern facade between 1610 and 1636.\n\n[[Philip V of Spain|Philip V of Bourbon]] renovated the royal apartments in 1700.{{sfn|Viso|2014|p=7-8}} The Alc\u00e1zar of the Habsburgs was austere in comparison to the [[Palace of Versailles]] where the new king had spent his childhood; and he began a series of redesigns mainly planned by [[Teodoro Ardemans]] and Ren\u00e9 Carlier, with the main rooms being redecorated by Queen [[Maria Luisa of Savoy]] and the [[Marie Anne de La Tr\u00e9moille, princesse des Ursins|Princess of Ursins]] in the style of French palaces.\n\n=== The baroque palace ===\n[[File:Vista de parte del Real Palacio desde la Cuesta de la Vega.jpg|left|thumb|View of part of the Royal Palace from Cuesta de la Vega, by [[Fernando Brambila]] (c. 1790-1832).

Response to the fire was delayed due to the warning bells being confused with the call to mass. For fear of looting, the doors of the building remained closed, hampering rescue efforts. Many works of art were lost, such as the ''Expulsion of the Moors'', by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]. Others, such as ''[[Las Meninas]]'', were rescued by tossing them out the windows. Fortunately, many pieces were saved because shortly before the blaze the king ordered that much of his collection be moved to the [[Buen Retiro Palace]]. This fire lasted four days and completely destroyed the old Alc\u00e1zar, whose remaining walls were finally demolished in 1738.\n\nItalian architect [[Filippo Juvarra]] oversaw work on the new palace and devised a lavish project of enormous proportions inspired by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini's]] plans for Versailles. This plan was not realized, due to Juvarra's untimely death in March 1736.{{sfn|Viso|2014|p=8}} His disciple Giambattista Sacchetti, also known as Juan Bautista Sacchetti or [[Giovanni Battista Sacchetti]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Calle del Arenal 13 |url=http://www.madridhistorico.com/seccion7_enciclopedia/index_enciclopedia.php?id=S&idinformacion=647&pag=1#inicio2 |encyclopedia=Madrid Hist\u00f3rico |author=[[Autonomous University of Madrid]] |date=6 May 2003 |access-date=30 November 2012 |language=es}}</ref> was chosen to continue the work of his mentor. Sacchetti designed the structure to encompass a large square courtyard and resolved sightline problems by creating projecting wings.\n\nIn 1760, [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] called upon Sicilian [[Francesco Sabatini]],{{sfn|Viso|2014|p=9}} a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] architect, to enlarge the building. Sabatini's original idea was to frame the Plaza de la Armer\u00eda with a series of galleries and arcades, to accommodate various dependencies{{clarify|date=May 2019|what \"dependencies\" exactly?}}, by constructing two wings along the square. Only the extension of the southeast tower known as ''la de San Gil'' was completed. Sabatini also planned to extend the north side with a large wing that echoed the style of the main building and included three square courtyards that would be smaller than the large central courtyard. Work on this expansion started quickly but was soon interrupted, leaving the foundations buried under a platform on which the royal stables were later built. The stables were demolished in the 20th century and replaced by the [[Sabatini Gardens]]. Charles III first occupied the palace in 1764.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], who spent many years imprisoned in the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Valen\u00e7ay]], began the most thorough renovation of the palace. The aim of this redesign was to turn the old-fashioned Italian-style building into a modern French-style palace. However, his grandson [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]] proposed to turn the palace into a [[Victorian era|Victorian-style]] residence. Alfonso's plans were designed by the architect Jos\u00e9 Segundo de Lema and consisted of remodeling several rooms, replacing marble floors with parquet, and adding period furniture.\n\nIn the twentieth century, restoration work was needed to repair damage suffered during the [[Spanish Civil War]], by repairing or reinstalling decoration and decorative trim and replacing damaged walls with faithful reproductions of the originals.\n\n== Exterior of the palace ==\n[[File:Palacio Real, Madrid, Espa\u00f1a, 2014-12-27, DD 12.JPG|thumbnail|left|One of the entrances to the Palace.]]\n[[File:Royal Palace of Madrid 01.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Detail of the facade over the Prince's Gate.

The statues do not match the names on the bases.]]\n\nThe main facade of the Palace, the one facing the Plaza de la Armeria, consists of a two-story rusticated stone base, from which rise [[Ionic columns]] on [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] pilasters framing the windows of the three main floors. The upper story is hidden behind a cornice which encircles the building and is capped with a large [[Baluster|balustrade]].  This was adorned with a series of statues of saints and kings, but these were relocated elsewhere under the reign of Charles III to give the building a more classical appearance.{{sfn|Sancho|2014|p=18}}\n\nThe restoration of the facade in 1973, which includes Sabitini's balcony of four [[Doric columns]], returned some of Sachetti's sculptures.  These include statues of the Aztec ruler [[Moctezuma II]] and the Inca emperor [[Atahualpa]], works by [[Juan Pascual de Mena]] and Domingo Mart\u00ednez, respectively.  Representations of the Roman emperors [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], [[Theodosius I]], and [[Arcadius]] by G.D. Olivieri, and [[Trajan]] by [[Felipe de Castro]] were placed in the Prince's courtyard.

However, the history of this square dates back to 1553, the year in which Philip II ordered a building to house the royal stables.\n\nThe [[Almudena Cathedral]] faces the palace across the plaza. Its exterior is neo-classical to match its surroundings while its interior is neo-gothic. Construction was funded by King Alfonso XII to house the remains of his wife [[Mercedes of Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"gomadrid\">{{cite web| title=Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de la Almudena| url=http://www.gomadrid.com/sights/catedral-almudena.html| publisher=GoMadrid.com| accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref> Construction of the church began in 1878 and concluded in 1992.\n\nNarciso Pascual Colomer, the same architect who crafted the [[Plaza de Oriente]], designed the layout of the plaza in 1879, but failed to materialize.  The site now occupied by the Plaza de la Armer\u00eda was used for many decades as anteplaza de armas. Sachetti tried to build a cathedral to finish the cornice of the [[Manzanares (river)|Manzanares]], and Sabatini proposed to unite this building with the royal palace, to form a single block. Both projects were ignored by Charles III.\n\n[[\u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez de los R\u00edos]] in 1868 proposed the creation of a large wooded area that would travel all around the Plaza de Oriente, in order to give a better view of the Royal Palace. A decade later Segundo de Lema added a staircase to the original design of Fern\u00e1ndez, which led to the idea of Francisco de Cubas to give more importance to the emerging church of Almudena.\n\n=== Plaza de Oriente ===\nThe Plaza de Oriente is a rectangular park that connects the east facade of Palacio Real to the [[Teatro Real]].  The eastern side of plaza is curved and bordered by several cafes in the adjoining buildings.  Although the plaza was part of Sacchetti's plan for the palace, construction did not begin until 1808 when King [[Joseph Bonaparte]], who ordered the demolition of approximately 60 medieval structures, that included a church, monastery and royal library, located on the site.  Joseph was deposed before construction was completed, it was finished by Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] who tasked architect [[Narciso Pascual Colomer]] with creating the final design in 1844.<ref name=\"goplaza\">{{cite web| title=Plaza de Oriente| url=http://www.gomadrid.com/sights/plaza-de-oriente.html| publisher=GoMadrid.com| date=| accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref><ref name=\"tourist\">{{cite web| title=Plaza de Oriente, Madrid| url=http://www.madrid-tourist.com/madrid-attractions/Plaza-Oriente-Madrid.html| publisher=Madrid-Tourist.com| accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Plaza de Oriente (Madrid) 11.jpg|thumb|250px|Statues of the Gothic kings in the Plaza de Oriente.]]\nPathways divide the Plaza into three main plots: the Central Gardens, the Cabo Noval Gardens and the Lepanto Gardens.  The Central Gardens are arranged in a grid around the central monument to [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], following the [[Baroque]] model garden. They consist of seven flowerbeds, each bordered with box hedges and holding small cypress, yew and [[magnolia]]s and annual flowers. The north and south boundaries of the Central Gardens are marked by a row of statues, popularly known as the ''Gothic kings''\u2014 sculptures representing five Visigoth rulers and fifteen rulers of the early Christian kingdoms in the [[Reconquista]]. They are carved from [[limestone]], and are part of a series dedicated to all [[List of heads of state of Spain|monarchs of Spain]].  These were ordered for the decoration of the Palacio Real and were executed between 1750 and 1753.  Engineers felt the statues were too heavy for the palace balustrade, so they were left on ground level where their lack of fine detail is readily apparent.  The remainder of the statues are in the Sabatini Gardens.<ref name=\"alvarez\">{{cite book| first= Miguel| last=\u00c1lvarez Rodr\u00edguez| title=Memoria monumental de Madrid: gu\u00eda de estatuas y bustos| year=2003| publisher=La Liberia| isbn=84-95889-61-7}}</ref><ref name=\"prieto\">{{cite book| last=Salvador Prieto| first=Mar\u00eda del Socorro| title=Escultura monumental en Madrid: calles, plazas y jardines p\u00fablicos (1875\u20131936)| year=1990| publisher=Alpuerto| isbn=84-381-0147-X}}</ref>\n\nIsabel II laid out the grounds so that [[Pietro Tacca]]'s [[equestrian statue]] of Philip IV was placed in the center, opposite the Prince's Gate.{{sfn|Sancho|2014|p=82}}\n\n=== Campo del Moro Gardens ===\n[[File:Espa\u00f1a - Madrid - Campo del Moro - Entrada.JPG|right|thumb|250px|View of Paseo Principal, part of Campo del Moro Gardens.]]\n\nThese gardens are so named because the Muslim leader Ali ben Yusuf allegedly camped here with his troops in 1109 during an attempted reconquest of Madrid. The first improvements to the area occurred under King Philip IV, who built fountains and planted various types of vegetation, but its overall look remained largely neglected.  During the construction of the palace various landscaping projects were put forth based on the gardens of the [[Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso]], but lack of funds hampered further improvement until the reign of Isabel II who began work in earnest. Following the taste of the times, the park was designed in the [[Romanticist]] style.\n\nThe Triton fountain from the Islet Garden of Aranjuez and the Fountain of the Shells from the Palace of the Infante Luis at Boadilla del Monte were aligned in the center of the right angled pathways by Isabel II, according to plans by [[Narciso Pascual Colomer]].  Under the regency of [[Maria Christina of Austria]], the park was reformed according to Ramon Oliva's [[romanticism]] plans.  Between the Fountain of Tritons and the palace is The Large Cavern or Grotto (Camellia House), built by [[Juan de Villanueva]] during the reign of [[Joseph Bonaparte]].  Sacchetti's 1757-1758 Little Cavern or Grotto (Potato Room) is in front of the Parade Ground.{{sfn|Sancho|2014|p=82-83}}{{sfn|Viso|2014|p=60-63}}\n\n=== Sabatini Gardens ===\n{{Main article|Sabatini Gardens}}\n[[File:Palacio Real, Madrid, Espa\u00f1a, 2014-12-27, DD 09.JPG|right|thumb|250px|View from the Sabatini Gardens.]]\n\nThe Sabatini Gardens adjoin the north side of the Palacio real and extend to the calle de Bail\u00e9n and the cuesta de San Vicente. The garden follows the symmetrical French design and work began in 1933, under the Republican government. Although they were designed by Zaragozan architect Fernando Garc\u00eda Mercadal, they were named for Francesco Sabatini who designed the royal stables that previously occupied this site.

Several rooms in the palace are regularly open to the public except during state functions. An admission fee of \u20ac13 is required, however some days it is free.\n\nThe palace is located on the site of a 9th-century [[Alc\u00e1zar]]  (\"Muslim-era fortress\"), near the town of Magerit, constructed as an outpost by [[Muhammad I of C\u00f3rdoba]]{{sfn|Viso|2014|p=7}} and inherited after 1036 by the independent [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Taifa of Toledo]].

In 1329, [[Alfonso XI of Castile|King Alfonso XI of Castile]] convened the ''cortes'' of Madrid for the first time. [[Felipe II of Spain|King Felipe II]] moved his court to Madrid in 1561.\n\nThe old ''[[Royal Alcazar of Madrid|Alc\u00e1zar]]'' was built on the location in the 16th century. After it burned 24 December 1734, [[Felipe V of Spain|King Felipe V]] ordered a new palace built on the same site. Construction spanned the years 1738 to 1755<ref name=\"patromonio\">{{cite web |url=http://www.patrimonionacional.es/Home/Palacios-Reales/Palacio-Real-de-Madrid.aspx |title=Palacio Real de Madrid |work=[[Patrimonio Nacional]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112062553/http://www.patrimonionacional.es/Home/Palacios-Reales/Palacio-Real-de-Madrid.aspx |archive-date=12 January 2013 |access-date=23 June 2019 |language=es}}</ref> and followed a [[Bernini]]esque design by [[Filippo Juvarra]] and Giovanni Battista Sacchetti in cooperation with [[Ventura Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Francesco Sabatini]], and [[Mart\u00edn Sarmiento]]. [[Carlos III of Spain|King Carlos III]] first occupied the new palace in 1764.\n\nThe last monarch who lived continuously in the palace was [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]], although [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]], president of the [[Spanish Second Republic|Second Republic]], also inhabited it, making him the last head of state to do so. During that period the palace was known as \"Palacio Nacional\". There is still a room next to the Real Capilla, which is known by the name \"Office of Aza\u00f1a\".\n\nThe interior of the palace is notable for its wealth of art and the use of many types of fine materials in the construction and the decoration of its rooms. It includes paintings by artists such as [[Caravaggio]], [[Juan de Flandes]], [[Francisco de Goya]], and [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]], and frescoes by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], [[Corrado Giaquinto]], and [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]. Other collections of great historical and artistic importance preserved in the building include the [[Royal Armoury of Madrid]], porcelain, watches, furniture, silverware, and the world's only complete [[Stradivarius]] string quintet.\n\n== History of the building ==\n{{See also|Royal Alcazar of Madrid|Project of Filippo Juvarra for the Royal Palace of Madrid}}\n[[File:Evoluci\u00f3n Alc\u00e1zar de Madrid.png|right|thumb|220px|Historical evolution of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid.]]\n\nThe palace was initially built by Muhammad I, [[Umayyad]] [[Emirate of Cordoba|Emir]] of [[Caliphate of Cordoba|Cordoba]], between 860 and 880. After the Moors were driven out of Toledo in the 11th century, the castle retained its defensive function. [[Henry III of Castile]] added several towers. His son [[John II of Castile|John II]] used it as a royal residence.{{sfn|Viso|2014|p=7}} During the [[War of the Castilian Succession]] (1476) the troops of [[Joanna la Beltraneja]] were besieged in the Alc\u00e1zar, during which the building suffered severe damage.\n\nThe only drawing of the castle from the [[Middle Ages]] is one from 1534 by Cornelius Vermeyen.{{sfn|Viso|2014|p=7}}\n\nEmperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], with the architects [[Alonso de Covarrubias]] and [[Luis de Vega]], extended and renovated the castle in 1537. [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] made Madrid his capital in 1561 and continued the renovations, with new additions. [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] added a long southern facade between 1610 and 1636.\n\n[[Philip V of Spain|Philip V of Bourbon]] renovated the royal apartments in 1700.{{sfn|Viso|2014|p=7-8}} The Alc\u00e1zar of the Habsburgs was austere in comparison to the [[Palace of Versailles]] where the new king had spent his childhood; and he began a series of redesigns mainly planned by [[Teodoro Ardemans]] and Ren\u00e9 Carlier, with the main rooms being redecorated by Queen [[Maria Luisa of Savoy]] and the [[Marie Anne de La Tr\u00e9moille, princesse des Ursins|Princess of Ursins]] in the style of French palaces.\n\n=== The baroque palace ===\n[[File:Vista de parte del Real Palacio desde la Cuesta de la Vega.jpg|left|thumb|View of part of the Royal Palace from Cuesta de la Vega, by [[Fernando Brambila]] (c. 1790-1832).

Response to the fire was delayed due to the warning bells being confused with the call to mass. For fear of looting, the doors of the building remained closed, hampering rescue efforts. Many works of art were lost, such as the ''Expulsion of the Moors'', by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]. Others, such as ''[[Las Meninas]]'', were rescued by tossing them out the windows. Fortunately, many pieces were saved because shortly before the blaze the king ordered that much of his collection be moved to the [[Buen Retiro Palace]]. This fire lasted four days and completely destroyed the old Alc\u00e1zar, whose remaining walls were finally demolished in 1738.\n\nItalian architect [[Filippo Juvarra]] oversaw work on the new palace and devised a lavish project of enormous proportions inspired by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini's]] plans for Versailles. This plan was not realized, due to Juvarra's untimely death in March 1736.{{sfn|Viso|2014|p=8}} His disciple Giambattista Sacchetti, also known as Juan Bautista Sacchetti or [[Giovanni Battista Sacchetti]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Calle del Arenal 13 |url=http://www.madridhistorico.com/seccion7_enciclopedia/index_enciclopedia.php?id=S&idinformacion=647&pag=1#inicio2 |encyclopedia=Madrid Hist\u00f3rico |author=[[Autonomous University of Madrid]] |date=6 May 2003 |access-date=30 November 2012 |language=es}}</ref> was chosen to continue the work of his mentor. Sacchetti designed the structure to encompass a large square courtyard and resolved sightline problems by creating projecting wings.\n\nIn 1760, [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] called upon Sicilian [[Francesco Sabatini]],{{sfn|Viso|2014|p=9}} a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] architect, to enlarge the building. Sabatini's original idea was to frame the Plaza de la Armer\u00eda with a series of galleries and arcades, to accommodate various dependencies{{clarify|date=May 2019|what \"dependencies\" exactly?}}, by constructing two wings along the square. Only the extension of the southeast tower known as ''la de San Gil'' was completed. Sabatini also planned to extend the north side with a large wing that echoed the style of the main building and included three square courtyards that would be smaller than the large central courtyard. Work on this expansion started quickly but was soon interrupted, leaving the foundations buried under a platform on which the royal stables were later built. The stables were demolished in the 20th century and replaced by the [[Sabatini Gardens]]. Charles III first occupied the palace in 1764.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], who spent many years imprisoned in the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Valen\u00e7ay]], began the most thorough renovation of the palace. The aim of this redesign was to turn the old-fashioned Italian-style building into a modern French-style palace. However, his grandson [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]] proposed to turn the palace into a [[Victorian era|Victorian-style]] residence. Alfonso's plans were designed by the architect Jos\u00e9 Segundo de Lema and consisted of remodeling several rooms, replacing marble floors with parquet, and adding period furniture.\n\nIn the twentieth century, restoration work was needed to repair damage suffered during the [[Spanish Civil War]], by repairing or reinstalling decoration and decorative trim and replacing damaged walls with faithful reproductions of the originals.\n\n== Exterior of the palace ==\n[[File:Palacio Real, Madrid, Espa\u00f1a, 2014-12-27, DD 12.JPG|thumbnail|left|One of the entrances to the Palace.]]\n[[File:Royal Palace of Madrid 01.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Detail of the facade over the Prince's Gate.

The upper story is hidden behind a cornice which encircles the building and is capped with a large [[Baluster|balustrade]].  This was adorned with a series of statues of saints and kings, but these were relocated elsewhere under the reign of Charles III to give the building a more classical appearance.{{sfn|Sancho|2014|p=18}}\n\nThe restoration of the facade in 1973, which includes Sabitini's balcony of four [[Doric columns]], returned some of Sachetti's sculptures.  These include statues of the Aztec ruler [[Moctezuma II]] and the Inca emperor [[Atahualpa]], works by [[Juan Pascual de Mena]] and Domingo Mart\u00ednez, respectively.  Representations of the Roman emperors [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], [[Theodosius I]], and [[Arcadius]] by G.D. Olivieri, and [[Trajan]] by [[Felipe de Castro]] were placed in the Prince's courtyard.

However, the history of this square dates back to 1553, the year in which Philip II ordered a building to house the royal stables.\n\nThe [[Almudena Cathedral]] faces the palace across the plaza. Its exterior is neo-classical to match its surroundings while its interior is neo-gothic. Construction was funded by King Alfonso XII to house the remains of his wife [[Mercedes of Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"gomadrid\">{{cite web| title=Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de la Almudena| url=http://www.gomadrid.com/sights/catedral-almudena.html| publisher=GoMadrid.com| accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref> Construction of the church began in 1878 and concluded in 1992.\n\nNarciso Pascual Colomer, the same architect who crafted the [[Plaza de Oriente]], designed the layout of the plaza in 1879, but failed to materialize.  The site now occupied by the Plaza de la Armer\u00eda was used for many decades as anteplaza de armas. Sachetti tried to build a cathedral to finish the cornice of the [[Manzanares (river)|Manzanares]], and Sabatini proposed to unite this building with the royal palace, to form a single block. Both projects were ignored by Charles III.\n\n[[\u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez de los R\u00edos]] in 1868 proposed the creation of a large wooded area that would travel all around the Plaza de Oriente, in order to give a better view of the Royal Palace. A decade later Segundo de Lema added a staircase to the original design of Fern\u00e1ndez, which led to the idea of Francisco de Cubas to give more importance to the emerging church of Almudena.\n\n=== Plaza de Oriente ===\nThe Plaza de Oriente is a rectangular park that connects the east facade of Palacio Real to the [[Teatro Real]].  The eastern side of plaza is curved and bordered by several cafes in the adjoining buildings.  Although the plaza was part of Sacchetti's plan for the palace, construction did not begin until 1808 when King [[Joseph Bonaparte]], who ordered the demolition of approximately 60 medieval structures, that included a church, monastery and royal library, located on the site.  Joseph was deposed before construction was completed, it was finished by Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] who tasked architect [[Narciso Pascual Colomer]] with creating the final design in 1844.<ref name=\"goplaza\">{{cite web| title=Plaza de Oriente| url=http://www.gomadrid.com/sights/plaza-de-oriente.html| publisher=GoMadrid.com| date=| accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref><ref name=\"tourist\">{{cite web| title=Plaza de Oriente, Madrid| url=http://www.madrid-tourist.com/madrid-attractions/Plaza-Oriente-Madrid.html| publisher=Madrid-Tourist.com| accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Plaza de Oriente (Madrid) 11.jpg|thumb|250px|Statues of the Gothic kings in the Plaza de Oriente.]]\nPathways divide the Plaza into three main plots: the Central Gardens, the Cabo Noval Gardens and the Lepanto Gardens.  The Central Gardens are arranged in a grid around the central monument to [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], following the [[Baroque]] model garden. They consist of seven flowerbeds, each bordered with box hedges and holding small cypress, yew and [[magnolia]]s and annual flowers. The north and south boundaries of the Central Gardens are marked by a row of statues, popularly known as the ''Gothic kings''\u2014 sculptures representing five Visigoth rulers and fifteen rulers of the early Christian kingdoms in the [[Reconquista]]. They are carved from [[limestone]], and are part of a series dedicated to all [[List of heads of state of Spain|monarchs of Spain]].  These were ordered for the decoration of the Palacio Real and were executed between 1750 and 1753.  Engineers felt the statues were too heavy for the palace balustrade, so they were left on ground level where their lack of fine detail is readily apparent.  The remainder of the statues are in the Sabatini Gardens.<ref name=\"alvarez\">{{cite book| first= Miguel| last=\u00c1lvarez Rodr\u00edguez| title=Memoria monumental de Madrid: gu\u00eda de estatuas y bustos| year=2003| publisher=La Liberia| isbn=84-95889-61-7}}</ref><ref name=\"prieto\">{{cite book| last=Salvador Prieto| first=Mar\u00eda del Socorro| title=Escultura monumental en Madrid: calles, plazas y jardines p\u00fablicos (1875\u20131936)| year=1990| publisher=Alpuerto| isbn=84-381-0147-X}}</ref>\n\nIsabel II laid out the grounds so that [[Pietro Tacca]]'s [[equestrian statue]] of Philip IV was placed in the center, opposite the Prince's Gate.{{sfn|Sancho|2014|p=82}}\n\n=== Campo del Moro Gardens ===\n[[File:Espa\u00f1a - Madrid - Campo del Moro - Entrada.JPG|right|thumb|250px|View of Paseo Principal, part of Campo del Moro Gardens.]]\n\nThese gardens are so named because the Muslim leader Ali ben Yusuf allegedly camped here with his troops in 1109 during an attempted reconquest of Madrid. The first improvements to the area occurred under King Philip IV, who built fountains and planted various types of vegetation, but its overall look remained largely neglected.  During the construction of the palace various landscaping projects were put forth based on the gardens of the [[Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso]], but lack of funds hampered further improvement until the reign of Isabel II who began work in earnest. Following the taste of the times, the park was designed in the [[Romanticist]] style.\n\nThe Triton fountain from the Islet Garden of Aranjuez and the Fountain of the Shells from the Palace of the Infante Luis at Boadilla del Monte were aligned in the center of the right angled pathways by Isabel II, according to plans by [[Narciso Pascual Colomer]].  Under the regency of [[Maria Christina of Austria]], the park was reformed according to Ramon Oliva's [[romanticism]] plans.  Between the Fountain of Tritons and the palace is The Large Cavern or Grotto (Camellia House), built by [[Juan de Villanueva]] during the reign of [[Joseph Bonaparte]].  Sacchetti's 1757-1758 Little Cavern or Grotto (Potato Room) is in front of the Parade Ground.{{sfn|Sancho|2014|p=82-83}}{{sfn|Viso|2014|p=60-63}}\n\n=== Sabatini Gardens ===\n{{Main article|Sabatini Gardens}}\n[[File:Palacio Real, Madrid, Espa\u00f1a, 2014-12-27, DD 09.JPG|right|thumb|250px|View from the Sabatini Gardens.]]\n\nThe Sabatini Gardens adjoin the north side of the Palacio real and extend to the calle de Bail\u00e9n and the cuesta de San Vicente. The garden follows the symmetrical French design and work began in 1933, under the Republican government.
