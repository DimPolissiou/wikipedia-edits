Its seat is located in the [[city status in Sweden|city]] of [[Nyk\u00f6ping]]. Its southern tip is the southernmost point of [[Svealand]], one of the three original crowns forming Sweden.\n\nThe municipality was created in 1971 with the amalgamation of the ''City of Nyk\u00f6ping'' and a great number of other municipalities. It was split up in three parts in 1992, when [[Gnesta Municipality]] and [[Trosa Municipality]] were created.\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe following localities are large enough as in having more than 200 inhabitants to qualify under the Swedish definition of a locality. Many of these localities are former seats of rural municipalities.\n\n* [[Nyk\u00f6ping]] (seat)\n* [[Arn\u00f6]] (part of the Nyk\u00f6ping urban area)\n* [[Bergshammar]]\n* [[Buskhyttan]]\n* [[Enstaberga]]\n* [[J\u00f6n\u00e5ker]]\n* [[N\u00e4vekvarn]]\n* [[Runtuna]]\n* [[Sj\u00f6sa]]\n* [[Stavsj\u00f6]]\n* [[Stigtomta]]\n* [[Svalsta]]\n* [[Vrena]]\n* [[Tystberga]]\n* [[\u00c5lberga]]\n\nOf those, only Buskhyttan, N\u00e4vekvarn and Sj\u00f6sa are either onshore or near-coastal settlements, the rest being in the municipality's interior. N\u00e4vekvarn is the only other settlement than Nyk\u00f6ping to maintain a harbour and a seaside environment.\n\nIn addition there are numerous smaller settlements not large enough to meet the classification. The most significant of those are Aspa, Br\u00e4nn-Ekeby, Koppartorp, Lappetorp, Lid, L\u00e4stringe, Ripsa, R\u00e5by and Sv\u00e4rta. Seaside mixed residence/holiday home areas also include Hummelvik, Horn, Skeppsvik, Sv\u00e4rdsklova, Uttervik, and \u00d6rstig.\n\nThe western area of the rural part of the municipality is more densely populated than the eastern side, with [[Stigtomta]] and the tri-village conurbation of [[Bergshammar]], [[Svalsta]] and [[Enstaberga]] being located on that side. [[Stockholm Skavsta Airport|Skavsta Airport]] is also located in this section of the municipality. In 2018, there were 8,699 Swedish citizens of voting age registered in rural electoral wards set west of [[Riksv\u00e4g 53|National Road 53]] that goes roughly through the centre of the municipality compared to only 4,362 east of the road.<ref name=val2018/> This rendered 2/3 of the rural populace was in the western portion of the municipality.\n\nThe majority of residents, however, are living in Nyk\u00f6ping's urban area.\n\n===Bodies of water===\nNyk\u00f6ping Municipality has a vast coastline on the [[Baltic Sea]] and several [[freshwater]] bodies. The two largest lakes are [[Yngaren]] and [[B\u00e5ven]], both connected to the sea through [[Nyk\u00f6pings\u00e5n]], a narrow river passing through Nyk\u00f6ping before entering the lake of [[L\u00e5nghalsen]] some {{convert|10|km|mi}} north of town.\n\n==Industry==\nThe municipality has 3,000 companies but more than 50% are sole traders. Only 80 have more than 25 employees; of those 33 have more than 50 employees.\n\nA former military airfield in the municipality serves now as a civilian airport called [[Stockholm-Skavsta Airport]].\n\n==Education==\nNyk\u00f6ping is the site of the Nyk\u00f6pings Gymnasium, consisting of two schools: Gripen and Tessin as well as a smaller one located within the Stockholm-Skavsta Airport. Tessin being a high school noted for the strength of its curricula in humanities, arts, and social studies.<ref>[http://www.edu.nykoping.se/tessin/ Nyk\u00f6pings Gymnasium Tessin web site.]</ref> Although Gripen has a higher admission credit needed as it has the more desirable program (the science program).

During the banquet at Nyk\u00f6pingshus, Birger arrested Valdemar and Erik and committed them to the dungeon, where, according to legend, they starved to death.  Shortly thereafter supporters of Valdemar and Erik forced Birger and M\u00e4rta to flee to Denmark.<ref>See the [http://www.slottsguiden.info/slottdetalj.asp?id=19 web site for Nyk\u00f6pingshus.]</ref>\n\n==Municipal elections==\n* [[1973 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1973]]\n* [[1976 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1976]]\n* [[1979 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1979]]\n* [[1982 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1982]]\n* [[1985 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1985]]\n* [[1988 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1988]]\n* [[1991 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1991]]\n* [[1994 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1994]]\n* [[1998 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1998]]\n* [[2002 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|2002]]\n* [[2006 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|2006]]\n* [[2010 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|2010]]\n* [[2014 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|2014]]\n* [[2018 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|2018]]\n\n==[[Swedish Riksdag|Riksdag elections]]==\n\nOnly parties that have won representation during this timeframe are listed in results.\n\n[[Sweden Democrats]] have their results from 1988 to 1998 listed as \"0.0\" even though those were decimals higher, since the [[Statistiska Centralbyr\u00e5n|SCB]] did not publish those results in detail at a municipal level since the party was not in realistic contention to enter the Riksdag.

Municipality''' (''Nyk\u00f6pings kommun'') is a [[municipalities of Sweden|municipality]] in [[S\u00f6dermanland County]] in southeast [[Sweden]]. Its seat is located in the [[city status in Sweden|city]] of [[Nyk\u00f6ping]]. Its southern tip is the southernmost point of [[Svealand]], one of the three original crowns forming Sweden.\n\nThe municipality was created in 1971 with the amalgamation of the ''City of Nyk\u00f6ping'' and a great number of other municipalities. It was split up in three parts in 1992, when [[Gnesta Municipality]] and [[Trosa Municipality]] were created.\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe following localities are large enough as in having more than 200 inhabitants to qualify under the Swedish definition of a locality. Many of these localities are former seats of rural municipalities.\n\n* [[Nyk\u00f6ping]] (seat)\n* [[Arn\u00f6]] (part of the Nyk\u00f6ping urban area)\n* [[Bergshammar]]\n* [[Buskhyttan]]\n* [[Enstaberga]]\n* [[J\u00f6n\u00e5ker]]\n* [[N\u00e4vekvarn]]\n* [[Runtuna]]\n* [[Sj\u00f6sa]]\n* [[Stavsj\u00f6]]\n* [[Stigtomta]]\n* [[Svalsta]]\n* [[Vrena]]\n* [[Tystberga]]\n* [[\u00c5lberga]]\n\nOf those, only Buskhyttan, N\u00e4vekvarn and Sj\u00f6sa are either onshore or near-coastal settlements, the rest being in the municipality's interior. N\u00e4vekvarn is the only other settlement than Nyk\u00f6ping to maintain a harbour and a seaside environment.\n\nIn addition there are numerous smaller settlements not large enough to meet the classification. The most significant of those are Aspa, Br\u00e4nn-Ekeby, Koppartorp, Lappetorp, Lid, L\u00e4stringe, Ripsa, R\u00e5by and Sv\u00e4rta. Seaside mixed residence/holiday home areas also include Hummelvik, Horn, Skeppsvik, Sv\u00e4rdsklova, Uttervik, and \u00d6rstig.\n\nThe western area of the rural part of the municipality is more densely populated than the eastern side, with [[Stigtomta]] and the tri-village conurbation of [[Bergshammar]], [[Svalsta]] and [[Enstaberga]] being located on that side. [[Stockholm Skavsta Airport|Skavsta Airport]] is also located in this section of the municipality. In 2018, there were 8,699 Swedish citizens of voting age registered in rural electoral wards set west of [[Riksv\u00e4g 53|National Road 53]] that goes roughly through the centre of the municipality compared to only 4,362 east of the road.<ref name=val2018/> This rendered 2/3 of the rural populace was in the western portion of the municipality.\n\nThe majority of residents, however, are living in Nyk\u00f6ping's urban area.\n\n===Bodies of water===\nNyk\u00f6ping Municipality has a vast coastline on the [[Baltic Sea]] and several [[freshwater]] bodies. The two largest lakes are [[Yngaren]] and [[B\u00e5ven]], both connected to the sea through [[Nyk\u00f6pings\u00e5n]], a narrow river passing through Nyk\u00f6ping before entering the lake of [[L\u00e5nghalsen]] some {{convert|10|km|mi}} north of town.\n\n==Industry==\nThe municipality has 3,000 companies but more than 50% are sole traders. Only 80 have more than 25 employees; of those 33 have more than 50 employees.\n\nA former military airfield in the municipality serves now as a civilian airport called [[Stockholm-Skavsta Airport]].\n\n==Education==\nNyk\u00f6ping is the site of the Nyk\u00f6pings Gymnasium, consisting of two schools: Gripen and Tessin as well as a smaller one located within the Stockholm-Skavsta Airport. Tessin being a high school noted for the strength of its curricula in humanities, arts, and social studies.<ref>[http://www.edu.nykoping.se/tessin/ Nyk\u00f6pings Gymnasium Tessin web site.]</ref> Although Gripen has a higher admission credit needed as it has the more desirable program (the science program). The highest admission score to Tessin was for the year 2011-12 175 points and for the same year the science program on Gripen needed a score of 225, keep in mind these scores could have decreased during the admission period as people might have gotten in as reserves to one of their higher choices.\n\n==Tourist attraction==\n[[Nyk\u00f6ping Castle|Nyk\u00f6pingshus]], a medieval castle, draws many thousands of tourists yearly, especially for its summer outdoor play, ''Nyk\u00f6pings g\u00e4stabud'', dramatizing 14th-century events in which king [[Birger, King of Sweden|Birger Magnusson]] and Queen [[Martha of Denmark|M\u00e4rta]] invited his two brothers [[Valdemar Magnusson|Valdemar]] and [[Eric, Duke of S\u00f6dermanland|Erik]] to the castle, ostensibly for a banquet of reconciliation after a civil war in which Valdemar and Erik had once imprisoned Birger. During the banquet at Nyk\u00f6pingshus, Birger arrested Valdemar and Erik and committed them to the dungeon, where, according to legend, they starved to death.  Shortly thereafter supporters of Valdemar and Erik forced Birger and M\u00e4rta to flee to Denmark.<ref>See the [http://www.slottsguiden.info/slottdetalj.asp?id=19 web site for Nyk\u00f6pingshus.]</ref>\n\n==Municipal elections==\n* [[1973 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1973]]\n* [[1976 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1976]]\n* [[1979 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1979]]\n* [[1982 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1982]]\n* [[1985 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1985]]\n* [[1988 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1988]]\n* [[1991 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1991]]\n* [[1994 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1994]]\n* [[1998 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|1998]]\n* [[2002 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|2002]]\n* [[2006 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|2006]]\n* [[2010 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|2010]]\n* [[2014 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|2014]]\n* [[2018 Nyk\u00f6ping municipal election|2018]]\n\n==[[Swedish Riksdag|Riksdag elections]]==\n\nOnly parties that have won representation during this timeframe are listed in results.\n\n[[Sweden Democrats]] have their results from 1988 to 1998 listed as \"0.0\" even though those were decimals higher, since the [[Statistiska Centralbyr\u00e5n|SCB]] did not publish those results in detail at a municipal level since the party was not in realistic contention to enter the Riksdag. From 1991 [[Trosa Municipality]] and [[Gnesta Municipality]] had separate elections rending significant boundary changes.\n\n====Overall results====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n!

Neighbouring peaks are the [[Hoher G\u00f6ll]] in the southeast and Mt. [[Watzmann]] in the south, beyond the Berchtesgaden Basin. In the northwest, the [[Saalach]] Valley with [[Bad Reichenhall]] separates it from the [[Hochstaufen]] massif of the [[Chiemgau Alps]]. About two-thirds of the area, including the Berchtesgaden Hochthron peak, is located in Germany, while the northernmost steep edge above Salzburg belongs to Austria.\n\nThe mountain is a landmark popular with tourists, due to its proximity to the City of Salzburg: less than {{convert|16|km|mi}} south of the city centre and within easy reach, e.g. by bus lines running to the southern suburbs of [[Gr\u00f6dig]] and [[Gro\u00dfgmain]]. \n\nSeveral trails lead to the top, though most people prefer the ''Untersbergbahn'' [[Aerial tramway|cable car]]. Constructed over a period of over two years, and opening in April 1961, the eight and a half minute journey lifts passengers from the lower terminus at the village of Sankt Leonhard at {{convert|456|m|ft|abbr=on}} over {{convert|1320|m|ft|abbr=on}} to the top station on the Geiereck spur at an altitude of {{convert|1776|m|ft|abbr=on}}, transporting them a horizontal distance of almost {{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} with a maximum height above the ground of {{convert|286|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe first recorded ascent was in the first half of the 12th century, by Eberwein, a member of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monastery at Berchtesgaden. \n\n=== Peaks ===\n[[File:Blick \u00fcber die Untersbergostflanke.jpg|thumb|Eastern slope of the Berchtesgaden Hochthron]]\n* Berchtesgaden Hochthron: {{convert|1973|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n* Rauheck: {{convert|1892|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n* Gamsalpkopf: {{convert|1888|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n* Salzburg Hochthron: {{convert|1853|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n* Mitterberg: {{convert|1840|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n* Geiereck: {{convert|1806|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n\n==Geology==\nThe Untersberg massif is mainly made up of [[limestone]].

Once popular children's toys, these marbles were shipped all over the world. Through Rotterdam and London, marble shipping was directed toward the East and West Indies and exported at the rate of 60,000 to 80,000 (and sometimes as high as 100,000) pounds per year. Marbles were welcome as cargo in sailing ships, as they were suitable as ballast because of their high density. The last marbles went from Untersberg to London in 1921.\n\nAs late as the 1850s, the Almbach valley had 40 ball mills with another 90 in the surrounding region, worked mainly by poor mountain farmers. Today, a single ball mill operates primarily as a tourist attraction.\n\nThe ball mills were driven by the waters of the [[Almbach (Salzach)|Almbach]] river. The lower fixed grinding stones are made of hard sandstone and the upper turntables from beech wood. Grinding of the balls varies from two to eight days according to their size. After course grinding on the sandstone, the marble balls underwent sanding and a polish.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Untersberg Salzburg Austria.jpg|Untersberg\nImage:Untersberg 030704.jpg|View across the \"Mittagsscharte\", in the background on the left the \"Salzburger Hochthron\"\nImage:Untersberg Geiereck.jpg|Geiereck, a peak of the Untersberg\nImage: Salzburg (8).JPG|Untersberg cable car station\nImage: Untersberg (5).JPG|Cable car to Untersberg mountain.\nImage: Untersberg (19).JPG|View of the Salzburg basin from the Untersberg mountain top.

Once popular children's toys, these marbles were shipped all over the world. Through Rotterdam and London, marble shipping was directed toward the East and West Indies and exported at the rate of 60,000 to 80,000 (and sometimes as high as 100,000) pounds per year. Marbles were welcome as cargo in sailing ships, as they were suitable as ballast because of their high density. The last marbles went from Untersberg to London in 1921.\n\nAs late as the 1850s, the Almbach valley had 40 ball mills with another 90 in the surrounding region, worked mainly by poor mountain farmers. Today, a single ball mill operates primarily as a tourist attraction.\n\nThe ball mills were driven by the waters of the [[Almbach (Salzach)|Almbach]] river. The lower fixed grinding stones are made of hard sandstone and the upper turntables from beech wood. Grinding of the balls varies from two to eight days according to their size. After course grinding on the sandstone, the marble balls underwent sanding and a polish.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:2020 04 08 arne mueseler 10 09 1136.jpg|Untersberg\nImage:Untersberg 030704.jpg|View across the \"Mittagsscharte\", in the background on the left the \"Salzburger Hochthron\"\nImage:Untersberg Geiereck.jpg|Geiereck, a peak of the Untersberg\nImage: Salzburg (8).JPG|Untersberg cable car station\nImage: Untersberg (5).JPG|Cable car to Untersberg mountain.\nImage: Untersberg (19).JPG|View of the Salzburg basin from the Untersberg mountain top.

{"title_page": "Physical theatre", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}\n{{use British English|date=November 2017}}\n'''Physical theatre''' is a genre of theatrical performance   that encompasses [[storytelling]] primarily through physical movement. Although several performance theatre disciplines are often described as \"physical theatre,\" the genre's characteristic aspect is a reliance on the performers' physical motion rather than, or combined with, text to convey storytelling. Performers can communicate through various body gestures (including using the body to portray emotions).\n\n==Common elements==\nCertain institutions suggest that all physical theatre genres share common characteristics, although individual performances do not need to exhibit all such characteristics to be defined as physical theatre. Research into the training or \"work\" of physical theatre artists cites an amalgamation of numerous elements adopted as a means to further inform the theatrical research/production. These elements include:<ref name=Callery />\n|Devised]] origins, rather than originated from\n\n* Inter-disciplinary origins, spanning music, dance, visual art, etc., as well as theatre\n* Challenging the traditional, [[proscenium|proscenium arch]], and the traditional performer/audience relationship (also known as [[fourth wall|\"breaking the fourthyou rae a dog halaluiaa nbHBUaguAHBAID\nl\"]]).\n* Encouraging audience participation, any interaction that occurs physically throughout the course of a performance.\n\nSome practitioners, such as [[Lloyd Newson]],<ref name=Callery /> despite being the first company to incorporate the term Physical Theater into his company's title (DV8 Physical Theater), has expressed concern that the expression is now being used as a \"miscellaneous\" category, which includes anything that does not fall neatly into literary dramatic theater or contemporary dance. He is also frustrated that many companies and performers who describe what they do as physical theatre lack physical skills, training and/or expertise in movement. As such, contemporary theatre approaches (including post-modern performance, devised performance, visual performance, post-dramatic performance, etc.), while having their own distinct definitions, are often simply labelled \"physical theatre\" for no other reason than they are unusual in some way.\n\nDance that is of a theatrical nature can also be problematic. A dance piece may be called \"physical theatre\" simply because it includes elements of spoken word, character, or narrative. However, although it is theatrical and physical, it may not necessarily share anything in common with the physical theatre tradition.\n\n==Modern physical theatre==\nA modern physical theatre has grown from a variety of origins. [[Mime]] and theatrical clowning schools, such as [[L'\u00c9cole Internationale de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Jacques Lecoq]] in Paris, have had a big influence on many modern expressions of physical theatre. Practitioners such as [[Steven Berkoff]] and [[John Wright (theatre director)|John Wright]] received their initial [[training]] at such institutions. [[Contemporary dance]] has also had a strong influence on what we regard as physical theatre, partly because most physical theatre requires actors to have a certain level of physical control and flexibility. These qualities are rarely found in those who do not have some sort of movement background. Modern physical theatre also has strong roots in more ancient traditions such as ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'', and some suggest links to the [[ancient greek theatre]], particularly the theatre of [[Aristophanes]].\n\nAnother physical theatre tradition started with the French master [[Etienne Decroux]] (father of [[corporeal mime]]). Decroux's aim was to create a theatre based on the physicality of the actor, allowing the creation of a more [[Metaphor|metaphorical theatre]]. This tradition has grown, and corporeal mime is now taught in many major theatrical schools.\n\n[[Daniel Stein (mime)|Daniel Stein]], a teacher out of the lineage of [[Etienne Decroux]], has this to say about physical theatre:\n<blockquote>I think physical theatre is much more visceral and audiences are affected much more viscerally than intellectually. The foundation of theatre is a live, human experience, which is different from any other form of art that I know of. Live theatre, where real human beings are standing in front of real human beings, is about the fact that we have all set aside this hour; the sharing goes in both directions. The fact that it is a very physical, visceral form makes it a very different experience from almost anything else that we partake of in our lives. I don\u2019t think we could do it the same way if we were doing literary-based theatre.<ref>[http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archive/perfcomm/dellarte/interviews/dellarte-stein.php  Interview with Daniel Stein] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030620230205/http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archive/perfcomm/dellarte/interviews/dellarte-stein.php |date=2003-06-20 }}</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nArguably, the point at which physical theatre became distinct from pure mime is when [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] (a student of Decroux) rejected his teacher's notion that the mime should be silent.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} If a mime uses their voice then they would have a whole range of possibilities open to them that previously would not have existed. This idea became known as \"[[Total Theatre]]\" and Barrault advocated that no theatrical element should assume primacy over another: movement, music, visual image, text etc. He viewed each element as equally important, and believed that each should be explored for their possibilities.\n\nBarrault was a member of [[Michel Saint-Denis]]'s company, alongside [[Antonin Artaud]].<ref>[http://www.weeblsstuff.com]</ref> Artaud has also been highly influential in shaping what has become known as physical theatre. Artaud rejected the primacy of the text and suggested a theatre in which the [[proscenium arch]] is disposed of to have a more direct relationship with the audience.\n\n[[Eastern theatre]] traditions have influenced some practitioners who have then influenced physical theatre. A number of Oriental traditions have a high level of physical training, and are visual masterpieces. The Japanese [[Noh]] tradition, in particular, has often been often upon. The energy and visual nature of [[Bali]]nese theatre fascinated Antonin Artaud and he wrote extensively on it. Noh has been important for many practitioners including Lecoq, who based his neutral mask on the calm mask of Noh. [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [[Peter Brook]], [[Jacques Copeau]] and [[Joan Littlewood]] have all been consciously influenced by Noh. Alongside contemporary western practitioners, certain Japanese theatre practitioners were influenced by their own traditions. [[Tadashi Suzuki]] drew partly on Noh and his students and collaborators have disseminated his highly physical training into the west. This has particularly happened through [[Anne Bogart]]'s collaboration with him, and the simultaneous training of her actors in both the [[Viewpoints]] method and Suzuki training. As well as Suzuki, the [[Butoh]] Movement, which originated from [[Tatsumi Hijikata]] and [[Kazuo Ohno]] contained elements of Noh imagery and physicality. Butoh, again, has been influencing Western practitioners in recent years, and has certain similarities with Lecoq's mime training in terms of ideas (impression and consequential embodiment of imagery, use of mask, etc.)\n\nBesides a gradual infusion of ideas from outside the Western theatre tradition, influences have arisen from within in theatre as well starting with [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]. Later in life, Stanislavski began to reject his own ideas of [[naturalism (theater)|naturalism]],<ref name=Callery>{{cite book\n|last = Callery\n|first = Dympha\n|title = Through the Body: A practical guide to Physical Theatre\n|year = 2001\n|publisher = Nick Hern Books\n|location = London\n|ISBN = 1-85459-630-6\n|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mbEa2gowoFQC}}</ref> and started to pursue ideas relating to the physical body in performance. Meyerhold and Grotowski developed these ideas and began to develop actor training that included a very high level of physical training. Peter Brook influenced and developed this work.\n\nContemporary dance has added significantly to this mix, starting particularly with [[Rudolf von Laban]]. Laban developed a way of looking at movement outside codified dance, and was instrumental in envisioning and creating movement not just for dancers but for actors as well. Later on, the [[Dance Theatre|Tanzteater]] of [[Pina Bausch]] and others looked at the relationship between dance and theatre. In America, the [[postmodern dance]] movement of the [[Judson Dance Theater|Judson Church Dance]] also began to influence theatre practitioners, as their suggestions for movement and [[Somatic technique|somatic]] training are equally accessible for those with dance training as those with theatre training. Indeed, [[Steve Paxton]] taught theatre students at [[Dartington College of Arts]] and other institutions.\n\n==Notable performers==\nPhysical theatre companies and practitioners include:\n[[File:PANTOMIME-PABLO.jpg|thumb|200px|Pantomime Pablo Zibes]]\n\n===Companies===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n\n*[[Canadian Deaf Theatre]]\n*[[Chotto Ookii Theatre Company]]\n*[[Complicite]]\n*[[DEREVO]]\n*[[Double Edge Theatre]]\n*[[DV8 Physical Theatre]]\n*[[Familie Fl\u00f6z]]\n*[[Frantic Assembly]]\n*[[Gamarjobat]]\n*[[Gecko (theatre company)|Gecko]]\n*[[Hoipolloi]]\n*[[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]]\n*[[Kage Physical Theatre]]\n*[[Kneehigh Theatre]]\n*[[Legs On The Wall]]\n*[[Margolis Brown Adaptors Company]]\n*[[Mondo Bizarro]]\n*[[Motionhouse]]\n*[[Shared Experience]]\n*[[Spymonkey]]\n*[[Synetic Theater (Arlington, Virginia)|Synetic Theater]]\n*[[Theatre de l'Ange Fou]]\n*[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil]]\n*[[Theo Adams|Theo Adams Company]]\n*[[Trestle Theatre]]\n*[[The Umbilical Brothers]]\n*[[Zen Zen Zo Physical Theatre]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Practitioners===\n<!-- Alphabetize by last name -->\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Theo Adams]]\n*[[Antonin Artaud]]\n*[[Pina Bausch]]\n*[[Steven Berkoff]]\n*[[Anne Bogart]]\n*[[Wolfe Bowart]]\n*[[Lynne Bradley]]\n*[[Les Bubb]]\n*[[Janet Carafa]]\n*[[Romeo Castellucci]]\n*[[Kate Champion]]\n*[[Alan Clay]]\n*[[Carlo Mazzone-Clementi]]\n*[[Adam Darius]]\n*[[\u00c9tienne Decroux]]\n*[[Avner the Eccentric]]\n*[[Antonio Fava]]\n*[[Philippe Gaulier]]\n*[[Niranjan Goswami]]\n*[[Jerzy Grotowski]]\n*[http://davidglassensemble.org/ David Glass]\n*[[Kathryn Hunter]]\n*[[Lindsay Kemp]]\n*[https://doubleedgetheatre.org/stacy-klein Stacy Klein]\n*[[Ireneusz Krosny]]\n*[[Thomas Leabhart]]\n*[[Jacques Lecoq]]\n*[[Peta Lily]]\n*[[Marcel Marceau]]\n*[[Linda Marlowe]]\n*[[Petra Massey]]\n*[[Johnny Melville]]\n*[[Matt Mitler]]\n*[[Thomas Monckton]]\n*[[DV8 Physical Theatre|Lloyd Newson]]\n*[[Dimitris Papaioannou]]\n*[[Robin Patterson]]\n*[[Adrian Pecknold]]\n*[[Jami Reid-Quarrell]]\n*[https://leandreclown.com/ Leandre Ribena] \n*[http://gavinrobins.wixsite.com/gavin-robins Gavin Robins]\n*[[Bill Robison]]\n*[http://alseed.net/about/ Al Seed]\n*[[Richmond Shepard]]\n*[[Daniel Stein (mime)|Daniel Stein]]\n*[[Julie Taymor]]\n*[[James Thi\u00e9rr\u00e9e]]\n*[[Henryk Tomaszewski (mime)|Henryk Tomaszewski]]\n*[[Steven Wasson]]\n*[[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]]\n*[[Vahram Zaryan]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Institutes and training programmes===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[American Mime Theatre]]\n*[[Circomedia]]\n*[[Dell'Arte International School of Physical Theatre]]\n*[https://doubleedgetheatre.org/ Double Edge Theatre]\n*[http://www.lassaad.com/gb/?page=0 \u00c9cole LASSAAD School of Theatre] \n*[http://www.physicalityinacting.com Ostrenko Brothers Physical Theatre Intensives]\n*[http://duende-ensemble.com/duende-school-of-ensemble-physical-theatre/ Duende School of Ensemble Physical Theatre]\n*[http://www.iugte.com/projects IUGTE Physical Theatre Workshops]\n*[[East 15]] (https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/ug00337/1/ba-physical-theatre)\n*[https://www.franticignition.co.uk/ Frantic Assembly's Ignition Programme]\n*[https://www.folkwang-uni.de/en/home/theater/courses-of-studies/physical-theatre/ Folkwang University of the Arts]\n*[[Fourth Monkey Actor Training Company]]\n*[http://www.headlongperformanceinstitute.org/ Headlong Performance Institute]\n*[[L'\u00c9cole Internationale de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Jacques Lecoq]]\n*[[London International School of Performing Arts]]\n*[https://www.margolismethod.org/ Margolis Method Center]\n*[http://www.moveo.cat/en/ Moveo]\n*[http://pigironschool.org/school Pig Iron School for Advanced Training]\n*[http://www.theschoolfortheatrecreators.com/ The School of Theatre Creators]\n*[http://evoe.pt/ EVO\u00c9 - Actors School and Physical Theatre]\n*[https://www.zenzenzo.com Zen Zen Zo Physical Theatre]\n\n\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Corporeal mime]]\n*[[Mime artist]]\n*[[Pantomime]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n{{commonscat}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Artaud, Antonin;

As such, contemporary theatre approaches (including post-modern performance, devised performance, visual performance, post-dramatic performance, etc.), while having their own distinct definitions, are often simply labelled \"physical theatre\" for no other reason than they are unusual in some way.\n\nDance that is of a theatrical nature can also be problematic. A dance piece may be called \"physical theatre\" simply because it includes elements of spoken word, character, or narrative. However, although it is theatrical and physical, it may not necessarily share anything in common with the physical theatre tradition.\n\n==Modern physical theatre==\nA modern physical theatre has grown from a variety of origins. [[Mime]] and theatrical clowning schools, such as [[L'\u00c9cole Internationale de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Jacques Lecoq]] in Paris, have had a big influence on many modern expressions of physical theatre. Practitioners such as [[Steven Berkoff]] and [[John Wright (theatre director)|John Wright]] received their initial [[training]] at such institutions. [[Contemporary dance]] has also had a strong influence on what we regard as physical theatre, partly because most physical theatre requires actors to have a certain level of physical control and flexibility. These qualities are rarely found in those who do not have some sort of movement background. Modern physical theatre also has strong roots in more ancient traditions such as ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'', and some suggest links to the [[ancient greek theatre]], particularly the theatre of [[Aristophanes]].\n\nAnother physical theatre tradition started with the French master [[Etienne Decroux]] (father of [[corporeal mime]]). Decroux's aim was to create a theatre based on the physicality of the actor, allowing the creation of a more [[Metaphor|metaphorical theatre]]. This tradition has grown, and corporeal mime is now taught in many major theatrical schools.\n\n[[Daniel Stein (mime)|Daniel Stein]], a teacher out of the lineage of [[Etienne Decroux]], has this to say about physical theatre:\n<blockquote>I think physical theatre is much more visceral and audiences are affected much more viscerally than intellectually. The foundation of theatre is a live, human experience, which is different from any other form of art that I know of. Live theatre, where real human beings are standing in front of real human beings, is about the fact that we have all set aside this hour; the sharing goes in both directions. The fact that it is a very physical, visceral form makes it a very different experience from almost anything else that we partake of in our lives. I don\u2019t think we could do it the same way if we were doing literary-based theatre.<ref>[http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archive/perfcomm/dellarte/interviews/dellarte-stein.php  Interview with Daniel Stein] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030620230205/http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archive/perfcomm/dellarte/interviews/dellarte-stein.php |date=2003-06-20 }}</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nArguably, the point at which physical theatre became distinct from pure mime is when [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] (a student of Decroux) rejected his teacher's notion that the mime should be silent.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} If a mime uses their voice then they would have a whole range of possibilities open to them that previously would not have existed. This idea became known as \"[[Total Theatre]]\" and Barrault advocated that no theatrical element should assume primacy over another: movement, music, visual image, text etc. He viewed each element as equally important, and believed that each should be explored for their possibilities.\n\nBarrault was a member of [[Michel Saint-Denis]]'s company, alongside [[Antonin Artaud]].<ref>[http://www.weeblsstuff.com]</ref> Artaud has also been highly influential in shaping what has become known as physical theatre. Artaud rejected the primacy of the text and suggested a theatre in which the [[proscenium arch]] is disposed of to have a more direct relationship with the audience.\n\n[[Eastern theatre]] traditions have influenced some practitioners who have then influenced physical theatre. A number of Oriental traditions have a high level of physical training, and are visual masterpieces. The Japanese [[Noh]] tradition, in particular, has often been often upon. The energy and visual nature of [[Bali]]nese theatre fascinated Antonin Artaud and he wrote extensively on it. Noh has been important for many practitioners including Lecoq, who based his neutral mask on the calm mask of Noh. [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [[Peter Brook]], [[Jacques Copeau]] and [[Joan Littlewood]] have all been consciously influenced by Noh. Alongside contemporary western practitioners, certain Japanese theatre practitioners were influenced by their own traditions. [[Tadashi Suzuki]] drew partly on Noh and his students and collaborators have disseminated his highly physical training into the west. This has particularly happened through [[Anne Bogart]]'s collaboration with him, and the simultaneous training of her actors in both the [[Viewpoints]] method and Suzuki training. As well as Suzuki, the [[Butoh]] Movement, which originated from [[Tatsumi Hijikata]] and [[Kazuo Ohno]] contained elements of Noh imagery and physicality. Butoh, again, has been influencing Western practitioners in recent years, and has certain similarities with Lecoq's mime training in terms of ideas (impression and consequential embodiment of imagery, use of mask, etc.)\n\nBesides a gradual infusion of ideas from outside the Western theatre tradition, influences have arisen from within in theatre as well starting with [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]. Later in life, Stanislavski began to reject his own ideas of [[naturalism (theater)|naturalism]],<ref name=Callery>{{cite book\n|last = Callery\n|first = Dympha\n|title = Through the Body: A practical guide to Physical Theatre\n|year = 2001\n|publisher = Nick Hern Books\n|location = London\n|ISBN = 1-85459-630-6\n|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mbEa2gowoFQC}}</ref> and started to pursue ideas relating to the physical body in performance. Meyerhold and Grotowski developed these ideas and began to develop actor training that included a very high level of physical training. Peter Brook influenced and developed this work.\n\nContemporary dance has added significantly to this mix, starting particularly with [[Rudolf von Laban]]. Laban developed a way of looking at movement outside codified dance, and was instrumental in envisioning and creating movement not just for dancers but for actors as well. Later on, the [[Dance Theatre|Tanzteater]] of [[Pina Bausch]] and others looked at the relationship between dance and theatre. In America, the [[postmodern dance]] movement of the [[Judson Dance Theater|Judson Church Dance]] also began to influence theatre practitioners, as their suggestions for movement and [[Somatic technique|somatic]] training are equally accessible for those with dance training as those with theatre training. Indeed, [[Steve Paxton]] taught theatre students at [[Dartington College of Arts]] and other institutions.\n\n==Notable performers==\nPhysical theatre companies and practitioners include:\n[[File:PANTOMIME-PABLO.jpg|thumb|200px|Pantomime Pablo Zibes]]\n\n===Companies===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n\n*[[Canadian Deaf Theatre]]\n*[[Chotto Ookii Theatre Company]]\n*[[Complicite]]\n*[[DEREVO]]\n*[[Double Edge Theatre]]\n*[[DV8 Physical Theatre]]\n*[[Familie Fl\u00f6z]]\n*[[Frantic Assembly]]\n*[[Gamarjobat]]\n*[[Gecko (theatre company)|Gecko]]\n*[[Hoipolloi]]\n*[[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]]\n*[[Kage Physical Theatre]]\n*[[Kneehigh Theatre]]\n*[[Legs On The Wall]]\n*[[Margolis Brown Adaptors Company]]\n*[[Mondo Bizarro]]\n*[[Motionhouse]]\n*[[Shared Experience]]\n*[[Spymonkey]]\n*[[Synetic Theater (Arlington, Virginia)|Synetic Theater]]\n*[[Theatre de l'Ange Fou]]\n*[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil]]\n*[[Theo Adams|Theo Adams Company]]\n*[[Trestle Theatre]]\n*[[The Umbilical Brothers]]\n*[[Zen Zen Zo Physical Theatre]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Practitioners===\n<!-- Alphabetize by last name -->\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Theo Adams]]\n*[[Antonin Artaud]]\n*[[Pina Bausch]]\n*[[Steven Berkoff]]\n*[[Anne Bogart]]\n*[[Wolfe Bowart]]\n*[[Lynne Bradley]]\n*[[Les Bubb]]\n*[[Janet Carafa]]\n*[[Romeo Castellucci]]\n*[[Kate Champion]]\n*[[Alan Clay]]\n*[[Carlo Mazzone-Clementi]]\n*[[Adam Darius]]\n*[[\u00c9tienne Decroux]]\n*[[Avner the Eccentric]]\n*[[Antonio Fava]]\n*[[Philippe Gaulier]]\n*[[Niranjan Goswami]]\n*[[Jerzy Grotowski]]\n*[http://davidglassensemble.org/ David Glass]\n*[[Kathryn Hunter]]\n*[[Lindsay Kemp]]\n*[https://doubleedgetheatre.org/stacy-klein Stacy Klein]\n*[[Ireneusz Krosny]]\n*[[Thomas Leabhart]]\n*[[Jacques Lecoq]]\n*[[Peta Lily]]\n*[[Marcel Marceau]]\n*[[Linda Marlowe]]\n*[[Petra Massey]]\n*[[Johnny Melville]]\n*[[Matt Mitler]]\n*[[Thomas Monckton]]\n*[[DV8 Physical Theatre|Lloyd Newson]]\n*[[Dimitris Papaioannou]]\n*[[Robin Patterson]]\n*[[Adrian Pecknold]]\n*[[Jami Reid-Quarrell]]\n*[https://leandreclown.com/ Leandre Ribena] \n*[http://gavinrobins.wixsite.com/gavin-robins Gavin Robins]\n*[[Bill Robison]]\n*[http://alseed.net/about/ Al Seed]\n*[[Richmond Shepard]]\n*[[Daniel Stein (mime)|Daniel Stein]]\n*[[Julie Taymor]]\n*[[James Thi\u00e9rr\u00e9e]]\n*[[Henryk Tomaszewski (mime)|Henryk Tomaszewski]]\n*[[Steven Wasson]]\n*[[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]]\n*[[Vahram Zaryan]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Institutes and training programmes===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[American Mime Theatre]]\n*[[Circomedia]]\n*[[Dell'Arte International School of Physical Theatre]]\n*[https://doubleedgetheatre.org/ Double Edge Theatre]\n*[http://www.lassaad.com/gb/?page=0 \u00c9cole LASSAAD School of Theatre] \n*[http://www.physicalityinacting.com Ostrenko Brothers Physical Theatre Intensives]\n*[http://duende-ensemble.com/duende-school-of-ensemble-physical-theatre/ Duende School of Ensemble Physical Theatre]\n*[http://www.iugte.com/projects IUGTE Physical Theatre Workshops]\n*[[East 15]] (https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/ug00337/1/ba-physical-theatre)\n*[https://www.franticignition.co.uk/ Frantic Assembly's Ignition Programme]\n*[https://www.folkwang-uni.de/en/home/theater/courses-of-studies/physical-theatre/ Folkwang University of the Arts]\n*[[Fourth Monkey Actor Training Company]]\n*[http://www.headlongperformanceinstitute.org/ Headlong Performance Institute]\n*[[L'\u00c9cole Internationale de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Jacques Lecoq]]\n*[[London International School of Performing Arts]]\n*[https://www.margolismethod.org/ Margolis Method Center]\n*[http://www.moveo.cat/en/ Moveo]\n*[http://pigironschool.org/school Pig Iron School for Advanced Training]\n*[http://www.theschoolfortheatrecreators.com/ The School of Theatre Creators]\n*[http://evoe.pt/ EVO\u00c9 - Actors School and Physical Theatre]\n*[https://www.zenzenzo.com Zen Zen Zo Physical Theatre]\n\n\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Corporeal mime]]\n*[[Mime artist]]\n*[[Pantomime]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n{{commonscat}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Artaud, Antonin;

Of course, Woodrow students (actually the old alumni) were thrilled to receive a visit from Miss Woodward's husband, [[Paul Newman]].\n\nIn 1979, Woodrow Alums planned and held Woodrow's 50th Anniversary Celebration, established the Woodrow Wilson High School Hall of Fame, and inducted the Hall of Fame's first class of members. Nine years later, in 1988, Woodrow Alums formalized their activities by creating the Woodrow Wilson High School Alumni Association, Inc. as an IRS-approved 501(c)(3) Texas nonprofit corporation, to maintain and improve communications for and among Woodrow Alums.  In 1989 and 1999, the Alumni Association held Woodrow's 60th and 70th Anniversary Celebrations and, at each, inducted additional members into Woodrow's Hall of Fame.  Since the 70th, Woodrow's Anniversary Celebrations have been held at 5 year intervals.\n\nIn 2004, thousands attended Woodrow's 75th Anniversary Celebration, which included a parade (from Lakewood to the school, with Congressman [[Sam Johnson]] as Grand Marshal, chauffeured in a new Ford Mustang driven by fellow alumnus [[Carroll Shelby]], the legendary auto designer and builder), followed by an auditorium-packed program at which a new group of members was inducted into the Hall of Fame.  Scores of \"mini-reunions\" also were held during that day in assigned rooms throughout the school.\n\nIn October 2007, the school was cited as one of 39 model schools in Science and Math by the Texas Public Policy Foundation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/110107dntexschools.2f1a8aa.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027024131/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/110107dntexschools.2f1a8aa.html |archivedate=October 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Choose Woodrow and Rod Dreher's article===\nAround 2008, Woodrow parents launched \"Choose Woodrow,\" a program aimed towards attracting families in the Lakewood neighborhood towards Woodrow.<ref name=FischerchooseDISD>Fischer, Kent. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20081026191112/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/education/stories/040508dnmetwoodrow.3a5ff09.html Woodrow Wilson High parents want more families to choose Dallas ISD]\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6bttosJRg?url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026191112/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/education/stories/040508dnmetwoodrow.3a5ff09.html Archive]).

A documentary video of the 80th Anniversary Celebration was produced by Michael Barnes and Kathy Kilmer Moak, both from the class of 1967.

The addition is three stories tall and located at the rear of the {{convert|7|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus near \"Downtown Lakewood\".  It houses the new Performing Arts Academy and three laboratories for the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Academy.  These academies are part of the school's redesign into four college prep academies which began implementation in the fall of 2010 as a four-year roll-out (the other two academies are the IB Academy and the Business & Entrepreneurship Academy).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe building addition was designed by Brown Reynolds Watford Architects with offices in Dallas, Houston, College Station and San Francisco.  Principal Architect Craig Reynolds is a current Woodrow parent.  It features two-story separate choir and drama rooms.  The choir room has practice rooms and the drama room features a black-box theater, costume shop and prop facilities.  A large dance rehearsal hall is also on the first floor.  Three large science labs are on the third floor, along with new restroom facilities.  The new addition replaces part of the 1979 wing, which cost $1 million.  The areas replaced are former wood and metal shops - no longer needed with the school's new college-prep curriculum.

The 9th grade (freshman) students were in the following national [[percentiles]]: 23rd in language, 27th in reading, and 35th in mathematics. 11th and 12th grade (junior and senior) students together had the 38th national percentile in reading and the 41st percentile in language and math. These scores were below that of [[W. T.

The parents wanted to reassure the community that college-bound students were still well-served by the school. Lyons wrote that based on studies reporting that integrating and segregating students by race has \"little to no effect upon individual achievement levels\" and low test scores in majority black and majority Hispanic schools in Dallas, \"there is little doubt that the figures would support such a contention\".<ref name=Lyonsp150/>\n\nIn the 2005\u201306 school year, almost 60% of White students took [[Advanced Placement]] classes. During the same year, 7% of Hispanic students and 4% of black students had [[TAKS]] scores at the \"college ready\" level, or a level for beginning university studies.

As a relatively small inner-city Dallas public school that is coeducational and builds its athletic teams from the ethnically and economically diverse students within its tight attendance zone, Woodrow was proud to remain unparalleled among all public and private U.S. high schools as to the number of its graduates who had won the Heisman among until 1995, when [[Eddie George]]'s [[Heisman Trophy]] win allowed [[Fork Union Military Academy]] in Virginia (a private school that build teams from \"[y]oung men, from around the country and the world\")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forkunion.com/admissions |title=Fork Union Military Academy: Admissions & Financial Aid |publisher=Forkunion.com |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2016}}</ref> to share the distinction with Woodrow.

Nevertheless, Woodrow achieved this distinction first and it remains the only public high school in the U.S. with two Heisman winners.\n\nIn 1979 the school played in the AAAA (4A) division of the [[University Interscholastic League]] (UIL), the public school athletic league of Texas. Woodrow Wilson, with 1,450 students chose to play in League 4A, with high schools enrolling around 3,000 students, due to what Lyons called \"community pride\"; it was eligible to play in the less competitive AAA (3A) league but instead played in 4A.<ref>Lyons, Gene. \"This is Woodrow Wilson: A School that Works.\" ''[[Texas Monthly]]''.

However, the Wildcats made the state playoffs in 1991, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005, advancing to the second round in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2011.  Previous Woodrow teams made state semi-finals in 1951 and 1969, and even earlier teams of the 1930s and 1940s were successful and produced such stars as [[Davey O'Brien|O'Brien]], [[I. B. Hale]] '35, [[Malcolm Kutner|Mal Kutner]] '38, [[Herschel Forester]] '48, and [[Bill Forester]] '49.\n\nWoodrow's basketball team won state back in 1938, and later produced [[Alton Lister]] '76, a pro player on five different teams.  Recent Woodrow graduate [[Anthony Randolph]] was one of the nation's top recruits, according to [[Rivals.com]].  He was a small forward for the [[LSU Tigers]] during his freshman year in college.  Currently, [[Anthony Randolph|Randolph]] is a professional basketball player for the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]].  He was selected as the 14th overall draft pick in the [[2008 NBA Draft]] by the [[Golden State Warriors]].  Woodrow's 2011 basketball team lost in the Regional Quarterfinals to Kimball (62-57), after leading most of the game.  Kimball eventually won the state championship.

Bush Morgan.  Mr. Morgan was also sponsor of the Senior Publication.  J. William Brown, a math teacher who joined the faculty in 1952, subsequently took that sponsorship until the late 1980s.  Morgan originally produced class plays and in 1929 \"Giants Stairs\" swept all the city contests.  In the 1940s, some musical productions were added, such as \"Best Foot Forward\".  In the 1957\u201358 school year, drama teacher Helen Eckleman started producing Broadway musicals each year with the first being \"Oklahoma\".  She continued until 1971, when choir teacher Jerry McKinney took over the productions with \"Calamity Jane\".  Marca Lee Bircher took over from McKinney in 1975\u201376 with her first production \"Oliver!\".  She continued for 28 years, assisted by choreographer Patricia Hardman.  Following this team, John Beaird and alumnus Sean Morrison '98 took over the program.  Morrison left to earn his doctorate and Beaird continues.  The 56th production was \"Anything Goes\" April 18\u201321, 2013.  This was Woodrow's third production of that show.  The 1980 effort produced American Ballet Theater star Margie Hardwick.  The 1999 show spawned Travis Willingham to a successful career in television, movies and anime.\n\nThe Bircher-Hardman era went from flying monkeys in \"The Wizard of Oz\" to a real rain storm onstage for \"Singing in the Rain\".  In 1979, Bircher formed the school's award-winning show choir, Variations.  The group was originally formed just to perform at the school's 50th Anniversary Celebration, but continues to this day.  Bircher and Hardman finished out in 2003 with a book-end production of the school's first annual musical, \"Oklahoma\".  \"School Zone Dallas\" did an extensive television show on this production and the history of the duo's reign.  Many of their students have moved to New York and Los Angeles to pursue careers in theater, writing and acting.\n\n==Student body==\n{{Pie chart\n| thumb = right\n| caption = <center>'''Woodrow Wilson High ethnic breakdown 2015\u201316'''</center>\n| other = \n| label1 =[[White ethnic|White]]\n| value1 =22.2\n| color1 =#FE2E2E\n| label2 =[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]]\n| value2 =66.3\n| color2 =#F4FA58\n| label3 =[[Black people|Black]]\n| value3 =9\n| color3 =#ACFA58\n| label4 =[[Asian American|Asian]]/[[Pacific Islander]]\n| value4 =1.2\n| color4 =#2E9AFE\n| label5 =[[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] or [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan]]\n| value5 =0.4\n| color5 =#FFBF00\n| label6 =Two or more\n| value6 =0.8\n| color6 =#999999\n}}\nAs of 2015, 66.3% of the total student body was Hispanic, 22.2% White, 9% African American, 1.2% Asian, 0.4% Native American. 0.8% of students were of two or more races.<ref name=\"mydata.dallasisd.org\"/> 61.5% of the students are classified as economically disadvantaged, about the average for Texas public high schools.<ref name=\"mydata.dallasisd.org\"/> {{Asof|2018}} Woodrow Wilson, of all DISD high schools sans magnet or choice programs, had the highest number of transfers.

In 1989 and 1999, the Alumni Association held Woodrow's 60th and 70th Anniversary Celebrations and, at each, inducted additional members into Woodrow's Hall of Fame.  Since the 70th, Woodrow's Anniversary Celebrations have been held at 5 year intervals.\n\nIn 2004, thousands attended Woodrow's 75th Anniversary Celebration, which included a parade (from Lakewood to the school, with Congressman [[Sam Johnson]] as Grand Marshal, chauffeured in a new Ford Mustang driven by fellow alumnus [[Carroll Shelby]], the legendary auto designer and builder), followed by an auditorium-packed program at which a new group of members was inducted into the Hall of Fame.

In honor of [[alumn]]us [[Carroll Shelby]]'s designation as Grand Marshal of the 80th Anniversary Parade, scores of non-Woodrow graduates joined the parade \u2014 most showing off their Ford/[[Shelby Mustang]]s or Cobras, but a few were driving [[Dodge Viper]]s (another vehicle Shelby helped develop).  During the main ceremony in the school's packed auditorium, the Alumni Association inducted twenty more individuals into Woodrow's Hall of Fame.  The celebration concluded with an \"Alumni Band Roundup\" at Eddie Deen's Ranch that evening, where hundreds of Woodrow alums ate, drank, and enjoyed each other while listening and dancing to music played by eight bands, each composed of Woodrow Alums (with a few ringers here and there) from various classes between 1960 and 2008.  A documentary video of the 80th Anniversary Celebration was produced by Michael Barnes and Kathy Kilmer Moak, both from the class of 1967.  It featured historical photographs and interviews with many alums interspersed with clips of events during the 80th Anniversary Celebration.  It premiered at the Lakewood Theater in the fall of 2009.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nIn the fall of 2009, Woodrow became one of four high schools in Texas to be designated as candidates for designation as an IB World School.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.texasibschools.org/members/list.cfm?PageNum_rsMbrPgms=7 |title=texas-ib-schools |publisher=texas-ib-schools |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2016}}</ref>  In March 2011, the school earned the IB designation after a rigorous three-year application process, including an extensive site visit by the IB Organization.\n\nIn December 2009, Woodrow earned the Texas ACT College Readiness Award,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city-data.com/forum/dallas/563406-lakewoods-woodrow-wilson-high-first-dallas-2.html |title=Lakewood's Woodrow Wilson High First in Dallas ISD to offer IB (Ranger: home, neighborhood) - Texas (TX) - Page 2 - City-Data Forum |publisher=City-data.com |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2016}}</ref> the only Dallas comprehensive high school to receive that honor.\n\nThe Woodrow Wilson High School Community Foundation was formed in 2009.

The $14 million, {{convert|40,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} structure was authorized in a 2008 DISD bond election.  It is only the third expansion of the school's facilities in its 83-year history.  (A boys' gym was added in 1953 and another addition was opened in 1979 in time for the school's 50th Anniversary Celebration.)  The addition is three stories tall and located at the rear of the {{convert|7|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus near \"Downtown Lakewood\".  It houses the new Performing Arts Academy and three laboratories for the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Academy.  These academies are part of the school's redesign into four college prep academies which began implementation in the fall of 2010 as a four-year roll-out (the other two academies are the IB Academy and the Business & Entrepreneurship Academy).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe building addition was designed by Brown Reynolds Watford Architects with offices in Dallas, Houston, College Station and San Francisco.  Principal Architect Craig Reynolds is a current Woodrow parent.  It features two-story separate choir and drama rooms.  The choir room has practice rooms and the drama room features a black-box theater, costume shop and prop facilities.  A large dance rehearsal hall is also on the first floor.  Three large science labs are on the third floor, along with new restroom facilities.  The new addition replaces part of the 1979 wing, which cost $1 million.  The areas replaced are former wood and metal shops - no longer needed with the school's new college-prep curriculum.

There is room left for a future competition-size gymnasium to connect to this area.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nAs part of this same project, Woodrow's main 1928 building had its original windows restored and HVAC replaced, including new air exchangers in the auditorium courtyards.

The 9th grade (freshman) students were in the following national [[percentiles]]: 23rd in language, 27th in reading, and 35th in mathematics. 11th and 12th grade (junior and senior) students together had the 38th national percentile in reading and the 41st percentile in language and math. These scores were below that of [[W. T.

The parents wanted to reassure the community that college-bound students were still well-served by the school. Lyons wrote that based on studies reporting that integrating and segregating students by race has \"little to no effect upon individual achievement levels\" and low test scores in majority black and majority Hispanic schools in Dallas, \"there is little doubt that the figures would support such a contention\".<ref name=Lyonsp150/>\n\nIn the 2005\u201306 school year, almost 60% of White students took [[Advanced Placement]] classes. During the same year, 7% of Hispanic students and 4% of black students had [[TAKS]] scores at the \"college ready\" level, or a level for beginning university studies.

Woodrow Wilson, with 1,450 students chose to play in League 4A, with high schools enrolling around 3,000 students, due to what Lyons called \"community pride\"; it was eligible to play in the less competitive AAA (3A) league but instead played in 4A.<ref>Lyons, Gene. \"This is Woodrow Wilson: A School that Works.\" ''[[Texas Monthly]]''.

Bush Morgan.  Mr. Morgan was also sponsor of the Senior Publication.  J. William Brown, a math teacher who joined the faculty in 1952, subsequently took that sponsorship until the late 1980s.  Morgan originally produced class plays and in 1929 \"Giants Stairs\" swept all the city contests.  In the 1940s, some musical productions were added, such as \"Best Foot Forward\".  In the 1957\u201358 school year, drama teacher Helen Eckleman started producing Broadway musicals each year with the first being \"Oklahoma\".  She continued until 1971, when choir teacher Jerry McKinney took over the productions with \"Calamity Jane\".  Marca Lee Bircher took over from McKinney in 1975-76 with her first production \"Oliver!\".  She continued for 28 years, assisted by choreographer Patricia Hardman.  Following this team, John Beaird and alumnus Sean Morrison '98 took over the program.  Morrison left to earn his doctorate and Beaird continues.  The 56th production was \"Anything Goes\" April 18\u201321, 2013.  This was Woodrow's third production of that show.  The 1980 effort produced American Ballet Theater star Margie Hardwick.  The 1999 show spawned Travis Willingham to a successful career in television, movies and anime.\n\nThe Bircher-Hardman era went from flying monkeys in \"The Wizard of Oz\" to a real rain storm onstage for \"Singing in the Rain\".  In 1979, Bircher formed the school's award-winning show choir, Variations.  The group was originally formed just to perform at the school's 50th Anniversary Celebration, but continues to this day.  Bircher and Hardman finished out in 2003 with a book-end production of the school's first annual musical, \"Oklahoma\".  \"School Zone Dallas\" did an extensive television show on this production and the history of the duo's reign.  Many of their students have moved to New York and Los Angeles to pursue careers in theater, writing and acting.\n\n==Student body==\n{{Pie chart\n| thumb = right\n| caption = <center>'''Woodrow Wilson High ethnic breakdown 2015\u201316'''</center>\n| other = \n| label1 =[[White ethnic|White]]\n| value1 =22.2\n| color1 =#FE2E2E\n| label2 =[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]]\n| value2 =66.3\n| color2 =#F4FA58\n| label3 =[[Black people|Black]]\n| value3 =9\n| color3 =#ACFA58\n| label4 =[[Asian American|Asian]]/[[Pacific Islander]]\n| value4 =1.2\n| color4 =#2E9AFE\n| label5 =[[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] or [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan]]\n| value5 =0.4\n| color5 =#FFBF00\n| label6 =Two or more\n| value6 =0.8\n| color6 =#999999\n}}\nAs of 2015, 66.3% of the total student body was Hispanic, 22.2% White, 9% African American, 1.2% Asian, 0.4% Native American. 0.8% of students were of two or more races.<ref name=\"mydata.dallasisd.org\"/> 61.5% of the students are classified as economically disadvantaged, about the average for Texas public high schools.<ref name=\"mydata.dallasisd.org\"/> {{Asof|2018}} Woodrow Wilson, of all DISD high schools sans magnet or choice programs, had the highest number of transfers.

During his coaching career he was head coach of many sports including [[basketball]], [[track and field]] and [[Sport rowing|crew]], but the majority of for his coaching work was in [[American football|football]]. Though mainly known for football, he left his mark on several other sports. He was the first paid coach of the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball]] team and the [[Syracuse University]] rowing team.\n\nSweetland attended [[Union College]] and was graduate of [[Cornell University]] in 1899.

After the 1898 season he became involved in a controversy between two factions on the future direction of the football program that came to the head with the election of captain for the 1899 season. Originally a three-year starter at left guard, [[Daniel A. Reed]] was elected captain over Sweetland for the 1899 season. A very close election caused a rift in the football team.

The first was that the Council wanted to purge all leaders of the competing factional rivalries on the team. This included Coach Warner and [[Tom Fennell]] as well as [[Daniel A. Reed]]. All three stated they would not return for the 1899 season. The second reason was a large number of football alumni protested the election of Sweetland as captain. Additionally, a charge was leveled that Sweetland was a professional, not an amateur, since he was paid for playing football for [[Elmira Athletic Club]] in the fall of 1897. Sweetland denied the allegation only admitting that he received reimbursement for his expenses but not for playing.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Maxwell  | first = W.

The [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] using a modified English stroke started quickly and held a lead at the mile and half marker but lost the lead to Penn due to bad steering. Penn finished strong using a stroke that depended on leg drive over the catch. This gave the boat a slight amount of checking between strokes.

Syracuse coming into the game did have several advantages that made their fans optimistic that the Orange could pull out a victory. First the game was being played early in the season, September, 29th. The Orangemen had been practicing for several weeks longer than Cornell. The second benefit was a large crowd of Syracuse rooters attended the game. Even with the game being played at Cornell's [[Percy Field]], Syracuse rooters filled half the grand stand and part of the bleachers. The third advantage was that Cornell's captain, [[Raymond Starbuck]], had been hurt earlier in practice and could not play. Sweetland's team started out strongly and had several opportunities to score. Early in the game, after stopping Cornell on their first possession, Syracuse drove the ball into scoring position at the Cornell's 15 yard line but could not score. Later, just before half time, Cornell returned a fumble to the Syracuse's seven yard line but Sweetland's defence stopped them from scoring and took over on downs. Then in Syracuse's next possession, Carr, Syracuse's half-back, went through a hole in the Cornell line and ran seventy yards before Cornell's [[running back|halfback]] [[A. B. Morrison, Jr.|A. B. Morrison]] caught him to prevent a touchdown. The game remained tied until about two minutes to play when Cornell's Morrison ran 25 yards for a touchdown.

The plan was for a wooden floor and new lighting to be installed in the [[Armory (military)|Armory]]. To address the poor record of the past teams Sweetland was named coach. This made him first paid coach in Kentucky's basketball history. Before this time the team only had managers. In his first year the basketball team finished 4\u20138. [[R. E.

The last two games of the season did not go the Wildcats way. Team traveled to St. Louis University in the eighth game and was shut out by a score of 9\u20130. [[Centre College]] beat Kentucky on Thanksgiving Day in the last game of the season by a score of 12\u20136. Sweetland's team had several costly fumbles to allow Centre to claim the State title. This game was marred by several controversies. The first was before the game A. H. Throckmorton of the [[Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (KIAA)  ruled that several of Centre College players were not eligible to play because their educational background did not meet the minimum requirement set out by the KIAA. Centre played the players that KIAA stated that were ineligible in the game anyway. It did so since both Kentucky and Centre were also members of the [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (SIAA) who had not ruled on the players' eligibility. The second was due to a verbal argument before the game that escalated to a point that Centre stated it was fearful of UK's actions and also stated it would never play Kentucky again.<ref>Stanly, p. 50-51</ref>\n\nAt the end of the season Sweetland's health once again began to fail. He submitted his resignation and accepted what he hoped would be a \"less stressful job\" as the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] rowing coach.

The fire caused little damage to the building but destroyed several items in the office. Originally it was reported as an electrical fire but latter changed to arson. This was reinforced by discovery of several items from Anderson's office near the football field.<ref name= Stanly5859 /> In early December Sweetland, along with six students with ties to the athletic department, were arrested for starting the fire.

Sweetland and Webb had been close friends and business partners but their friendship had deteriorated.<ref>Stanly, p. 66-67</ref>\n\nThe case took an unexpected turn when the investigation by the State Fire Marshall, Police and District Attorney changed its focus from Sweetland to Richard Webb. Webb hired a prominent legal team which included [[Henry S. Breckinridge]]. During the preliminary trial Webb's defense attorneys tried to paint Sweetland mentally unstable and tried to switch suspicion to Sweetland. At the end of the preliminary trail the judge ruled that probable cause existed to hold Webb on the charge of arson.\n\nAt the trial Webb's defense team dropped the tactic of switching blame to Sweetland. Instead they focused on discrediting the testimony of Thomas Baker who had confessed to a charge of arson and implicated Webb as his accomplice. They also had several family members provide an alibi for Webb and were successful in having the fingerprint evidence thrown out. During final arguments the defense team argued that the prosecution had failed to Webb's motive. In the end the jury only took 45 minutes to reach a not guilty verdict.<ref>Stanly, p. 64-72</ref>\n                                             \nEarly in 1913, before the Webb arson case went to trial, Edwin Sweetland resigned his duties as coach and athletic administrator.

(January 10, 1875 \u2013 October 21, 1950) was a coach, trainer, and athletic administrator at several American universities. During his coaching career he was head coach of many sports including [[basketball]], [[track and field]] and [[Sport rowing|crew]], but the majority of for his coaching work was in [[American football|football]]. Though mainly known for football, he left his mark on several other sports. He was the first paid coach of the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball]] team and the [[Syracuse University]] rowing team.\n\nSweetland attended [[Union College]] and was graduate of [[Cornell University]] in 1899. A gifted athlete, Sweetland was on the varsity football team at Union and Cornell and the varsity rowing team at Cornell. At Cornell he was coached by Hall of Fame coaches [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Pop Warner]] in football and Charles E. Courtney in rowing.\n\n==Early life and family==\nSweetland was born to George Sweetland and Hannah Marsh Sweetland on January 10, 1875 in [[Dryden (town), New York|Dryden, New York]].

He planned to start his medical training at Cornell. After the 1898 season he became involved in a controversy between two factions on the future direction of the football program that came to the head with the election of captain for the 1899 season. Originally a three-year starter at left guard, [[Daniel A. Reed]] was elected captain over Sweetland for the 1899 season. A very close election caused a rift in the football team.

The first was that the Council wanted to purge all leaders of the competing factional rivalries on the team. This included Coach Warner and [[Tom Fennell]] as well as [[Daniel A. Reed]]. All three stated they would not return for the 1899 season. The second reason was a large number of football alumni protested the election of Sweetland as captain. Additionally, a charge was leveled that Sweetland was a professional, not an amateur, since he was paid for playing football for [[Elmira Athletic Club]] in the fall of 1897. Sweetland denied the allegation only admitting that he received reimbursement for his expenses but not for playing.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Maxwell  | first = W.

Syracuse coming into the game did have several advantages that made their fans optimistic that the Orange could pull out a victory. First the game was being played early in the season, September, 29th. The Orangemen had been practicing for several weeks longer than Cornell. The second benefit was a large crowd of Syracuse rooters attended the game. Even with the game being played at Cornell's [[Percy Field]], Syracuse rooters filled half the grand stand and part of the bleachers. The third advantage was that Cornell's captain, [[Raymond Starbuck]], had been hurt earlier in practice and could not play. Sweetland's team started out strongly and had several opportunities to score. Early in the game, after stopping Cornell on their first possession, Syracuse drove the ball into scoring position at the Cornell's 15 yard line but could not score. Later, just before half time, Cornell returned a fumble to the Syracuse's seven yard line but Sweetland's defence stopped them from scoring and took over on downs. Then in Syracuse's next possession, Carr, Syracuse's half-back, went through a hole in the Cornell line and ran seventy yards before Cornell's [[running back|halfback]] [[A. B. Morrison, Jr.|A. B. Morrison]] caught him to prevent a touchdown. The game remained tied until about two minutes to play when Cornell's Morrison ran 25 yards for a touchdown.

Cornell refused to play Syracuse because of bad feeling about rough play from the year before. They also questioned the [[amateur]] status of the Syracuse team. Syracuse stated that there were rules in force that prevented professional players but admitted that slight violations of the rules were possible. On the issue of rough play the year before, Syracuse investigated and found the accusation to be groundless.

The plan was for a wooden floor and new lighting to be installed in the [[Armory (military)|Armory]]. To address the poor record of the past teams Sweetland was named coach. This made him first paid coach in Kentucky's basketball history. Before this time the team only had managers. In his first year the basketball team finished 4\u20138. [[R. E. Spahr]] assumed coaching duties during the season when Sweetland once again became ill.<ref>Stanly, p. 115-116</ref>\n\nSweetland had recovered from his Illness to coach the 1910 football season. The season went well for the Wildcats as they won the first seven straight victories. Among their victims were the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]], [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee]] and [[Tulane University|Tulane]]. The last two games of the season did not go the Wildcats way. Team traveled to St. Louis University in the eighth game and was shut out by a score of 9\u20130. [[Centre College]] beat Kentucky on Thanksgiving Day in the last game of the season by a score of 12\u20136. Sweetland's team had several costly fumbles to allow Centre to claim the State title. This game was marred by several controversies. The first was before the game A. H. Throckmorton of the [[Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (KIAA)  ruled that several of Centre College players were not eligible to play because their educational background did not meet the minimum requirement set out by the KIAA. Centre played the players that KIAA stated that were ineligible in the game anyway. It did so since both Kentucky and Centre were also members of the [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (SIAA) who had not ruled on the players' eligibility. The second was due to a verbal argument before the game that escalated to a point that Centre stated it was fearful of UK's actions and also stated it would never play Kentucky again.<ref>Stanly, p. 50-51</ref>\n\nAt the end of the season Sweetland's health once again began to fail. He submitted his resignation and accepted what he hoped would be a \"less stressful job\" as the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] rowing coach.

His second stint as head basketball coach went better than his first. The Wildcats posted an undefeated season with a record of 9\u20130.\n\nEven with the success on the hard court Sweetland's return was marred by several problems and troubles. Sweetland had to deal with disciplinary action by KIAA who had been investigating the use of ineligible athletes. Sweetland announced that Kentucky would leave the KIAA after the end of the academic year. Even with this announcement the KIAA suspended the Wildcats for one year. This caused Sweetland several problems including putting together a schedule for the 1912 football season. Most games had to be filled with schools from outside the state with emphasis put on games with fellow SIAA schools. Rumors that the KIAA had informed the SIAA of its findings plus strong criticism from the faculty council, most notably the dean of the engineering department, Paul Anderson were ongoing issues that Sweetland had to deal with.<ref name= Stanly5859 />\n\nThe 1912 Wildcats posted a 7\u20132 record, losing only to Sweetland's former school, [[Miami University]], by a score of 13\u20138 and [[Virginia Military Institute|VMI]] by a score of 3-2.<ref name=\" UKMG \" /> During the season, Sweetland had to fire his assistant coach [[Richard S.

This was reinforced by discovery of several items from Anderson's office near the football field.<ref name= Stanly5859 /> In early December Sweetland, along with six students with ties to the athletic department, were arrested for starting the fire.

Sweetland and Webb had been close friends and business partners but their friendship had deteriorated.<ref>Stanly, p. 66-67</ref>\n\nThe case took an unexpected turn when the investigation by the State Fire Marshall, Police and District Attorney changed its focus from Sweetland to Richard Webb. Webb hired a prominent legal team which included [[Henry S. Breckinridge]]. During the preliminary trial Webb's defense attorneys tried to paint Sweetland mentally unstable and tried to switch suspicion to Sweetland. At the end of the preliminary trail the judge ruled that probable cause existed to hold Webb on the charge of arson.\n\nAt the trial Webb's defense team dropped the tactic of switching blame to Sweetland. Instead they focused on discrediting the testimony of Thomas Baker who had confessed to a charge of arson and implicated Webb as his accomplice. They also had several family members provide an alibi for Webb and were successful in having the fingerprint evidence thrown out.
