Its name comes from its origins in the [[Southeastern United States]] whose lyrics are written to express either personal or a communal faith regarding biblical teachings and [[Christianity|Christian]] life, as well as (in terms of the varying music styles) to give a Christian alternative to mainstream secular music. Sometimes known as \"[[quartet]] music\" for its traditional \"four men and a piano\" set up, southern gospel has evolved over the years into a popular form of music across the United States and overseas, especially among [[baby boomers]] and those living in the Southern United States. Like other forms of music the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of southern gospel varies according to culture and social context. It is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace.\n\n==Origins==\nThe date of southern gospel's establishment as a distinct genre is generally considered to be 1910, the year the first professional quartet was formed for the purpose of selling songbooks for the [[James David Vaughan|James D. Vaughan]] Music Publishing Company in [[Lawrenceburg, Tennessee]]. Nonetheless the style of the music itself had existed for at least 35 years prior although the traditional wisdom that southern gospel music was \"invented\" in the 1870s by circuit preacher Everett Beverly is spurious.  The existence of the genre prior to 1910 is evident in the work of [[Charles Davis Tillman]] (1861\u20131943), who popularized \"The Old Time Religion\", wrote \"Life's Railway to Heaven\" and published 22 songbooks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmahalloffame.org/inductee_bio.cfm?ID=253|title=Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame site on Tillman|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501114721/http://www.gmahalloffame.org/inductee_bio.cfm?ID=253|archivedate=May 1, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{New Georgia Encyclopedia|id=m-1885|name=Charles Davis Tillman|author=|date=|accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hymntime.com/tch/bio/t/i/tillman_cd.htm|title=Cyberhymnal on Tillman}}</ref> Some of the genre's roots can be found in the publishing work and \"normal schools\" or [[singing school|singing schools]] of [[Aldine Silliman Kieffer|Aldine S. Kieffer]] and [[Ephraim Ruebush]]. Southern gospel was promoted by traveling singing school teachers, quartets, and [[shape note]] music publishing companies such as the [[Anthony Johnson Showalter|A. J. Showalter]] Company (1879) and the [[Stamps-Baxter Music Company|Stamps-Baxter Music and Printing Company]]. Over time, southern gospel came to be an eclectic musical form with groups singing traditional hymns, ''a capella'' (jazz-style singing with no instruments) songs, country, bluegrass, spirituals, and \"convention songs\". Because it grew out of the musical traditions of white musicians from the American South, the name Southern gospel was used to differentiate it from so-called [[Traditional black gospel|black gospel]].<ref name=\"isbn1-57003-598-9\">{{cite book|last=Edgar|first=Walter B.|title=The South Carolina Encyclopedia |publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, S.C.|year=2006|page=385|isbn=1-57003-598-9}}</ref><ref name=\"isbn0-8078-5346-1\">{{cite book|last=Goff|first=James R.|title=Close Harmony: A History of Southern Gospel|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|year=2002|isbn=0-8078-5346-1}}</ref>\n\nConvention songs typically have contrasting homophonic and contrapuntal sections. In the homophonic sections, the four parts sing the same words and rhythms. In the contrapuntal sections, each group member has a unique lyric and rhythm. These songs are called \"convention songs\" because various conventions were organized across the United States for the purpose of getting together regularly and singing songs in this style. Convention songs were employed by training centers like the Stamps-Baxter School Of Music as a way to teach quartet members how to concentrate on singing their own part. Examples of convention songs include \"Heavenly Parade,\" \"I'm Living In Canaan Now,\" \"[[Give the World a Smile]],\" and \"Heaven's Jubilee.\"\n\n==Early performers==\nSouthern gospel is sometimes called \"quartet music\" by fans because of the originally all-male, tenor-lead-baritone-bass quartet makeup. Early quartets were typically either [[a cappella]] or accompanied only by piano or guitar, and in some cases a piano and banjo in areas that were influenced by bluegrass music such as [[Appalachia]]. Over time, full bands were added and even later, pre-recorded accompaniments (soundtracks) were introduced.\n\nIn the first decades of the twentieth century, southern gospel drew much of its creative energy from the [[holiness movement]] churches that arose throughout the south. Early gospel artists such as The [[Speer Family]], The Stamps Quartet, The Blackwood Family, and The Lefevre Trio achieved wide popularity through their recordings and radio performances in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. On October 20, 1927, The Stamps Quartet recorded its early hit \"Give The World A Smile\" for RCA Victor, which become the Quartet's theme song. The Stamps Quartet was heard on the radio throughout Texas and the South. A handful of groups were considered pioneers in southern gospel music for a series of \"firsts.\" The Blackwood Brothers, with [[James Blackwood]] and [[J.D. Sumner]] became the first group to travel in a bus, which is on display at the [[Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame]] at [[Dollywood]] in [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee]]. Sumner also was instrumental in creating the [[National Quartet Convention]], an annual music festival where many groups, both known and well known perform for a week. The Speer Family was known for bringing blended groups to mainstream popularity where both male and female performers toured together. The best known group of the 1950s and 1960s was [[Statesmen Quartet]], which set the trend for broad appeal of the all-male quartets that would develop years later. The Statesmen were known for their showmanship and introduction of jazz, ragtime, and even some early rock and roll elements into their music and their stage appearance with trendy suits and wide audience appeal and were known for their signature song, \"Happy Rhythm\" (Rockin and a'Rollin).\n\n==Representative artists==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nFrom the start of the genre, the predominant type of artist has been the male quartet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Goff|first1=James R.|title=The rise of Southern Gospel music|journal=Church History|date=1998|volume=67|issue=4|page=722}}</ref> Notable examples from the past and present include, [[The Blue Ridge Quartet]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgma.org/gogr_history/blue_ridge.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 21, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003195602/http://www.sgma.org/gogr_history/blue_ridge.htm |archive-date=October 3, 2011 }}</ref>, The Swanee River Boys, [[The Blackwood Brothers]], [[Brian Free and Assurance]], The [[Cathedral Quartet]], [[Christian Troubadours]], [[Ernie Haase & Signature Sound]], The [[Florida Boys]],  The [[Gaither Vocal Band]], [[Gold City]], [[The Inspirations]], [[Jake Hess]] and [[the Imperials]], The [[Kingdom Heirs]] Quartet, The [[Kingsmen Quartet]], [[Legacy Five]], [[Mercy River Boys]],<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Cusic|first=Don|date=1979-07-28|title=Southern Gospel Grows from Rural Roots|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT51|magazine=Billboard|volume=91|issue=30|page=51|pages=|doi=|issn=0006-2510|pmid=|access-date=}}\n</ref> [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], The [[Singing Christians]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sghistory.com/index.php?n=C.Canaan_1970s|title=C / Canaan1970s|website=Southern Gospel History|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref> The Stamps Quartet, The [[Statesmen Quartet]], and the Plainsmen Quartet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bisher|first1=Furman|title=They Put Rhythm in Religion|journal=Saturday Evening Post|date=1956|volume=228|issue=52|page=32}}</ref>.  \n\nTrios and duos have also been a vital element of southern gospel for most of the genre's history. From decades past, pioneer groups like [[The Chuck Wagon Gang|Chuck Wagon Gang]], [[The Happy Goodman Family]], [[The Rambos]], The [[LeFevres]], The Lesters, [[Speer Family]], and The [[Bill Gaither Trio]] paved the way for modern lineups such as [[The Crabb Family]], [[The Hinsons]],  [[The Hoppers]], [[The Isaacs]], [[Jeff and Sheri Easter]], [[The Martins]], [[The McKameys]], [[The Perrys]], [[The Perry Sisters]], and The [[Talley Trio]].\n\nAll-male trios also are very popular. Groups such as [[Greater Vision]] and the [[Booth Brothers]] are immensely popular. Both have been nominated for numerous [[Grammy Awards]].\n\nThe genre also has a growing number of popular soloists. Many of these gained their initial popularity with a group before launching out on their own as soloists. Some of the most well known have been [[Jimmie Davis]], [[Jason Crabb]], [[Ivan Parker]], [[Squire Parsons]], and [[Janet Paschal]]. Country singer [[Webb Pierce]] recorded \"I Love Him Dearly\", and [[Grandpa Jones]] recorded southern gospel song also. \n\n===Notable artists===\n[[J.D. Sumner|J.D. Sumner and The Stamps]] toured with [[Elvis Presley]], who originally wanted to be a Gospel singer despite trying out for numerous groups and never receiving an offer to join. Sumner and Presley met when Elvis was 14 years old and the two forged a strong relationship. Sumner sang at Presley's funeral and debunked many myths about Presley's alleged substance abuse and also credited Elvis for saving his life when Presley confronted Sumner about his alcoholism. Sumner held the world record for the lowest bass note ever hit for a human being until 2002, four years after his death.\n\n[[Anthony Burger]] was the main pianist for Gaither's Homecoming Series before passing away suddenly in 2006 during a performance. At the age of five, Burger was accepted at the Cadek Conservatory at the [[University of Tennessee]] at [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]]. A child prodigy, Burger was playing classical piano repertoire within a few years. In the latter part of his career and life, the world-renowned classical piano company [[Steinway & Sons]] announced that Burger was being added to their exclusive roster of endorsing artists, making him the first southern gospel pianist to ever hold that honor.\n\n[[The Cathedrals]] were perhaps the most successful quartet of the 1980s and 1990s. The group had massive appeal and recorded their 1987 album ''Symphony of Praise'' with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and also made numerous appearances [[NBC]]'s [[The Today Show]]. After the deaths of frontmen George Younce and Glenn Payne, the Cathedrals spawned off two current groups that are immensely popular, The [[Legacy Five]] and [[Ernie Haase and Signature Sound]].\n\n[[Vestal Goodman]] perhaps the most influential female recording artist of the 20th century with a career that spanned five decade.  Born Vestal Freeman, she started, like most gospel singers do, singing in her home church in Fyffe, Alabama. When she married [[Howard Goodman]] in 1949, Vestal joined Howard's siblings in their family group [[The Happy Goodman Family]]. Many variations of the group existed over the seven decades the family traveled and recorded but the combination that came about in the early 1960s of Howard, Rusty, Sam and Vestal would go on to change the sound of Southern Gospel forever. The Goodmans were a powerhouse sound and with the addition of some electric guitars, bass, steel guitar and drums they made and impact on southern gospel still felt today. Vestal was awarded the first ever Dove Award for Female Vocalist of the Year which in those days was called \"Queen of Gospel Music\" which was a title Vestal held until and even after her passing. The Goodmans were featured artists on the Gospel Singing Jubilee and after the group took a hiatus in the 1980s Howard and Vestal were featured artists on TBN and PTL Club. 1990 saw the recording of a reunion album and shortly thereafter the passings of Rusty and Sam. In 1991 [[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)|Bill Gaither]] invited Howard and Vestal to be part of his new recording project called \"Homecoming\" which would launch a whole new season of their career. Howard and Vestal were a much anticipated part of Homecoming concerts and videos. In the late 90s and early 2000s Vestal started to branch off and do solo projects including 2 cookbooks and 2 duet albums called \"Vestal & Friends\" which featured Vestal singing songs with her friends in both the gospel and secular genres. Artists like [[George Jones]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Andra\u00e9 Crouch]], [[George Younce]], [[Jeff & Sheri Easter]], [[Mark Lowry]] and many more. In November 2002 Howard died during their retirement tour \"The Final Stand\", Vestal finished the tour dates and continued to appear with the [[Gaither Homecoming]]. On December 27, 2003 Vestal died in Celebration, Florida while on Christmas vacation, she was 74. In 2004 the Southern Gospel Hall of Fame inducted Vestal into the Hall of Fame.\n\nSeveral secular artists have expressed their love for and influence of the genre by recording southern gospel albums or performing gospel songs in concert. Among them are [[Johnny Cash]], [[Patsy Cline]], [[Dailey & Vincent]], [[Charlie Daniels]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Larry Gatlin]], [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Alan Jackson]], [[Kentucky Thunder]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[The Louvin Brothers]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], [[Brad Paisley]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Leann Rimes]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[The Statler Brothers]], [[Marty Stuart]], [[Randy Travis]], [[Carrie Underwood]], and [[Hank Williams]].\n\n==Gaither Homecoming series==\nTraditional southern gospel music underwent a tremendous surge in popularity during the 1990s thanks to the efforts of [[Bill and Gloria Gaither]] and their [[Gaither Homecoming]] tours and videos, which began as a reunion of many of the best known and loved SGM individuals in 1991. Thanks in part to the Homecoming series, southern gospel music now has fans across the United States and in a number of foreign countries like Ireland and Australia.\n\n==Today's southern gospel==\nBy the 1990s, the \"old-timey\" quartet-style music began to develop to include more soloists and duos. Although still mostly popular in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] and [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], it has a nationwide and even an international audience. The music remains \"more country than city, more down-home than pretentious\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Monte|last=Mitchell|title=Gospel Radio DJ Touches Fans' Hearts and Souls|work=The Charlotte Observer|date=August 8, 1993}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, ''The Radio Book'', a broadcast yearbook published by M Street Publications, reported 285 radio stations in the U.S. with a primary format designation as \"southern gospel,\" including 175 AM stations and 110 FM stations. In fact, southern gospel was the 9th most popular format for AM stations and the 21st most popular for FM. Southern gospel radio promoters routinely service more than a thousand radio stations which play at least some southern gospel music each week. Recent years have also seen the advent of a number of internet-only southern gospel \"radio\" stations.\n\nTwo popular satellite stations that feature southern gospel are channel 34 on XM Satellite Radio and Channel 67 On Sirius Satellite Radio. Both play the same feed entitled, \"[[enLighten]] on SiriusXm\". Enlighten plays southern gospel and has several featured programs which air weekly including ''Paul Heil's Gospel Greats'' and ''[[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)|Bill Gaither]]'s Homecoming Radio''.<ref name=EnLighten>{{cite web|url=http://www.sogoradio.com|title=EnLighten ... Southern Gospel Radio for all of North America!|publisher=Southern Gospel Radio|quote=''Enlightened'' featured on XM and Sirius radio|accessdate=June 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOver the last decade, a newer version of southern gospel has grown in popularity.  This style is called [[progressive southern gospel]] and is characterized by a blend of traditional southern gospel, bluegrass, modern country, contemporary Christian and pop music elements. Progressive southern gospel generally features artists who push their voices to produce a sound with an edge to it. The traditional style southern gospel singers employ a more classical singing style.\n\nLyrically, most progressive southern gospel songs are patterned after traditional southern gospel in that they maintain a clear evangelistic and/or testimonial slant. Southern gospel purists view lyrical content and the underlying musical style as the key determining factors for applying the southern gospel label to a song.\n\nAlthough there are some exceptions, most southern gospel songs would not be classified as [[Worship music|Praise and Worship]]. Few southern gospel songs are sung \"to\" God as opposed to \"about\" God. On the other hand, southern gospel lyrics are typically overt in their  Christian message unlike [[Contemporary Christian music]] (CCM) which sometimes has had \"double entendre\" lyrics, which could be interpreted as being about a devout love for God or an earthly love for a man or woman.\n\n==Southern gospel media==\nBecoming popular through songbooks, such as those published by [[R. E. Winsett]] of [[Dayton, Tennessee]], southern gospel was and is one of the few genres to use recordings, radio, and television technologies from the very beginning for the advancements of promoting the genre.<ref>See, ''e.g.'', [[J. Bazzel Mull]].</ref>\n\nOne of the longest-running print magazines for southern gospel music has been the [[Singing News]].<ref name=SingingNews>{{cite web |url=http://www.singingnews.com/ |title=Southern Gospel Music, News, Christian Concerts, Charts, Radio, Songs &#124; The Southern Gospel Music Magazine &#124; SingingNews.com |author= The Singing News |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= The Singing News |accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref> They started in the early 1970s supplying radio airplay charts and conducting annual fan based awards. They also supply popular topic forums for southern gospel fans to meet and discuss the genre. The move to internet services has brought along companies such as [[SoGospelNews.com]] which has become a noted e-zine forum for southern gospel and has remained a supporter for the past twelve years.

Some of these media outlets are: Sunlite Radio which features many of the southern gospel programs likewise heard on traditional radio.

The Statesmen were known for their showmanship and introduction of jazz, ragtime, and even some early rock and roll elements into their music and their stage appearance with trendy suits and wide audience appeal and were known for their signature song, \"Happy Rhythm\" (Rockin and a'Rollin).\n\n==Representative artists==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nFrom the start of the genre, the predominant type of artist has been the male quartet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Goff|first1=James R.|title=The rise of Southern Gospel music|journal=Church History|date=1998|volume=67|issue=4|page=722}}</ref> Notable examples from the past and present include, [[The Blue Ridge Quartet]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgma.org/gogr_history/blue_ridge.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 21, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003195602/http://www.sgma.org/gogr_history/blue_ridge.htm |archive-date=October 3, 2011 }}</ref>, The Swanee River Boys, [[The Blackwood Brothers]], [[Brian Free and Assurance]], The [[Cathedral Quartet]], [[Christian Troubadours]], [[Ernie Haase & Signature Sound]], The [[Florida Boys]],  The [[Gaither Vocal Band]], [[Gold City]], [[The Inspirations]], [[Jake Hess]] and [[the Imperials]], The [[Kingdom Heirs]] Quartet, The [[Kingsmen Quartet]], [[Legacy Five]], [[Mercy River Boys]],<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Cusic|first=Don|date=1979-07-28|title=Southern Gospel Grows from Rural Roots|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT51|magazine=Billboard|volume=91|issue=30|page=51|pages=|doi=|issn=0006-2510|pmid=|access-date=}}\n</ref> [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], The [[Singing Christians]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sghistory.com/index.php?n=C.Canaan_1970s|title=C / Canaan1970s|website=Southern Gospel History|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref> The Stamps Quartet, The [[Statesmen Quartet]], and the Plainsmen Quartet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bisher|first1=Furman|title=They Put Rhythm in Religion|journal=Saturday Evening Post|date=1956|volume=228|issue=52|page=32}}</ref>.  \n\nTrios and duos have also been a vital element of southern gospel for most of the genre's history. From decades past, pioneer groups like [[The Chuck Wagon Gang|Chuck Wagon Gang]], [[The Happy Goodman Family]], [[The Rambos]], The [[LeFevres]], The Lesters, [[Speer Family]], and The [[Bill Gaither Trio]] paved the way for modern lineups such as [[The Crabb Family]], [[The Hinsons]],  [[The Hoppers]], [[The Isaacs]], [[Jeff and Sheri Easter]], [[The Martins]], [[The McKameys]], [[The Perrys]], [[The Perry Sisters]], and The [[Talley Trio]].\n\nAll-male trios also are very popular. Groups such as [[Greater Vision]] and the [[Booth Brothers]] are immensely popular. Both have been nominated for numerous [[Grammy Awards]].\n\nThe genre also has a growing number of popular soloists. Many of these gained their initial popularity with a group before launching out on their own as soloists. Some of the most well known have been [[Jimmie Davis]], [[Jason Crabb]], [[Ivan Parker]], [[Squire Parsons]], and [[Janet Paschal]]. Country singer [[Webb Pierce]] recorded \"I Love Him Dearly\", and [[Grandpa Jones]] recorded southern gospel song also. \n\n===Notable artists===\n[[J.D. Sumner|J.D. Sumner and The Stamps]] toured with [[Elvis Presley]], who originally wanted to be a Gospel singer despite trying out for numerous groups and never receiving an offer to join. Sumner and Presley met when Elvis was 14 years old and the two forged a strong relationship. Sumner sang at Presley's funeral and debunked many myths about Presley's alleged substance abuse and also credited Elvis for saving his life when Presley confronted Sumner about his alcoholism. Sumner held the world record for the lowest bass note ever hit for a human being until 2002, four years after his death.\n\n[[Anthony Burger]] was the main pianist for Gaither's Homecoming Series before passing away suddenly in 2006 during a performance. At the age of five, Burger was accepted at the Cadek Conservatory at the [[University of Tennessee]] at [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]]. A child prodigy, Burger was playing classical piano repertoire within a few years. In the latter part of his career and life, the world-renowned classical piano company [[Steinway & Sons]] announced that Burger was being added to their exclusive roster of endorsing artists, making him the first southern gospel pianist to ever hold that honor.\n\n[[The Cathedrals]] were perhaps the most successful quartet of the 1980s and 1990s. The group had massive appeal and recorded their 1987 album ''Symphony of Praise'' with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and also made numerous appearances [[NBC]]'s [[The Today Show]]. After the deaths of frontmen George Younce and Glenn Payne, the Cathedrals spawned off two current groups that are immensely popular, The [[Legacy Five]] and [[Ernie Haase and Signature Sound]].\n\n[[Vestal Goodman]] perhaps the most influential female recording artist of the 20th century with a career that spanned five decade.  Born Vestal Freeman, she started, like most gospel singers do, singing in her home church in Fyffe, Alabama. When she married [[Howard Goodman]] in 1949, Vestal joined Howard's siblings in their family group [[The Happy Goodman Family]]. Many variations of the group existed over the seven decades the family traveled and recorded but the combination that came about in the early 1960s of Howard, Rusty, Sam and Vestal would go on to change the sound of Southern Gospel forever. The Goodmans were a powerhouse sound and with the addition of some electric guitars, bass, steel guitar and drums they made and impact on southern gospel still felt today. Vestal was awarded the first ever Dove Award for Female Vocalist of the Year which in those days was called \"Queen of Gospel Music\" which was a title Vestal held until and even after her passing. The Goodmans were featured artists on the Gospel Singing Jubilee and after the group took a hiatus in the 1980s Howard and Vestal were featured artists on TBN and PTL Club. 1990 saw the recording of a reunion album and shortly thereafter the passings of Rusty and Sam. In 1991 [[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)|Bill Gaither]] invited Howard and Vestal to be part of his new recording project called \"Homecoming\" which would launch a whole new season of their career. Howard and Vestal were a much anticipated part of Homecoming concerts and videos. In the late 90s and early 2000s Vestal started to branch off and do solo projects including 2 cookbooks and 2 duet albums called \"Vestal & Friends\" which featured Vestal singing songs with her friends in both the gospel and secular genres. Artists like [[George Jones]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Andra\u00e9 Crouch]], [[George Younce]], [[Jeff & Sheri Easter]], [[Mark Lowry]] and many more. In November 2002 Howard died during their retirement tour \"The Final Stand\", Vestal finished the tour dates and continued to appear with the [[Gaither Homecoming]]. On December 27, 2003 Vestal died in Celebration, Florida while on Christmas vacation, she was 74. In 2004 the Southern Gospel Hall of Fame inducted Vestal into the Hall of Fame.\n\nSeveral secular artists have expressed their love for and influence of the genre by recording southern gospel albums or performing gospel songs in concert. Among them are [[Johnny Cash]], [[Patsy Cline]], [[Dailey & Vincent]], [[Charlie Daniels]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Larry Gatlin]], [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Alan Jackson]], [[Kentucky Thunder]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[The Louvin Brothers]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], [[Brad Paisley]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Leann Rimes]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[The Statler Brothers]], [[Marty Stuart]], [[Randy Travis]], [[Carrie Underwood]], and [[Hank Williams]].\n\n==Gaither Homecoming series==\nTraditional southern gospel music underwent a tremendous surge in popularity during the 1990s thanks to the efforts of [[Bill and Gloria Gaither]] and their [[Gaither Homecoming]] tours and videos, which began as a reunion of many of the best known and loved SGM individuals in 1991. Thanks in part to the Homecoming series, southern gospel music now has fans across the United States and in a number of foreign countries like Ireland and Australia.\n\n==Today's southern gospel==\nBy the 1990s, the \"old-timey\" quartet-style music began to develop to include more soloists and duos. Although still mostly popular in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] and [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], it has a nationwide and even an international audience. The music remains \"more country than city, more down-home than pretentious\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Monte|last=Mitchell|title=Gospel Radio DJ Touches Fans' Hearts and Souls|work=The Charlotte Observer|date=August 8, 1993}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, ''The Radio Book'', a broadcast yearbook published by M Street Publications, reported 285 radio stations in the U.S. with a primary format designation as \"southern gospel,\" including 175 AM stations and 110 FM stations. In fact, southern gospel was the 9th most popular format for AM stations and the 21st most popular for FM. Southern gospel radio promoters routinely service more than a thousand radio stations which play at least some southern gospel music each week. Recent years have also seen the advent of a number of internet-only southern gospel \"radio\" stations.\n\nTwo popular satellite stations that feature southern gospel are channel 34 on XM Satellite Radio and Channel 67 On Sirius Satellite Radio. Both play the same feed entitled, \"[[enLighten]] on SiriusXm\". Enlighten plays southern gospel and has several featured programs which air weekly including ''Paul Heil's Gospel Greats'' and ''[[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)|Bill Gaither]]'s Homecoming Radio''.<ref name=EnLighten>{{cite web|url=http://www.sogoradio.com|title=EnLighten ... Southern Gospel Radio for all of North America!|publisher=Southern Gospel Radio|quote=''Enlightened'' featured on XM and Sirius radio|accessdate=June 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOver the last decade, a newer version of southern gospel has grown in popularity.  This style is called [[progressive southern gospel]] and is characterized by a blend of traditional southern gospel, bluegrass, modern country, contemporary Christian and pop music elements. Progressive southern gospel generally features artists who push their voices to produce a sound with an edge to it. The traditional style southern gospel singers employ a more classical singing style.\n\nLyrically, most progressive southern gospel songs are patterned after traditional southern gospel in that they maintain a clear evangelistic and/or testimonial slant. Southern gospel purists view lyrical content and the underlying musical style as the key determining factors for applying the southern gospel label to a song.\n\nAlthough there are some exceptions, most southern gospel songs would not be classified as [[Worship music|Praise and Worship]]. Few southern gospel songs are sung \"to\" God as opposed to \"about\" God. On the other hand, southern gospel lyrics are typically overt in their  Christian message unlike [[Contemporary Christian music]] (CCM) which sometimes has had \"double entendre\" lyrics, which could be interpreted as being about a devout love for God or an earthly love for a man or woman.\n\n==Southern gospel media==\nBecoming popular through songbooks, such as those published by [[R. E. Winsett]] of [[Dayton, Tennessee]], southern gospel was and is one of the few genres to use recordings, radio, and television technologies from the very beginning for the advancements of promoting the genre.<ref>See, ''e.g.'', [[J. Bazzel Mull]].</ref>\n\nOne of the longest-running print magazines for southern gospel music has been the [[Singing News]].<ref name=SingingNews>{{cite web |url=http://www.singingnews.com/ |title=Southern Gospel Music, News, Christian Concerts, Charts, Radio, Songs &#124; The Southern Gospel Music Magazine &#124; SingingNews.com |author= The Singing News |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= The Singing News |accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref> They started in the early 1970s supplying radio airplay charts and conducting annual fan based awards. They also supply popular topic forums for southern gospel fans to meet and discuss the genre.

He received considerable recognition from the Punjabi elite after his return from [[England]] in 1908, and he was closely associated with [[Mian Muhammad Shafi]]. When the [[All-India Muslim League]] was expanded to the provincial level, and Shafi received a significant role in the structural organisation of the [[Punjab Muslim League]], Iqbal was made one of the first three joint secretaries along with Shaikh Abdul Aziz and Maulvi Mahbub Alam.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of the All-India Muslim League (1906\u20131947)|last=Afzal|first=Rafique M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-19-906735-0|location=Karachi, Pakistan|pages=15}}</ref> While dividing his time between law practice and poetry, Iqbal remained active in the Muslim League. He did not support Indian involvement in [[World War I]] and stayed in close touch with Muslim political leaders such as [[Mohammad Ali Jouhar]] and [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. He was a critic of the mainstream [[Indian National Congress]], which he regarded as dominated by [[Hindus]], and was disappointed with the League when, during the 1920s, it was absorbed in factional divides between the pro-British group led by Shafi and the centrist group led by Jinnah.<ref name=\"brightpk.com\" />{{unreliable source?|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn November 1926, with the encouragement of friends and supporters, Iqbal contested the election for a seat in the [[Punjab Legislative Assembly]] from the Muslim district of Lahore, and defeated his opponent by a margin of 3,177 votes.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> He supported the [[Fourteen Points of Jinnah|constitutional proposals]] presented by Jinnah to guarantee Muslim political rights and influence in a coalition with the Congress and worked with the [[Aga Khan]] and other Muslim leaders to mend the factional divisions and achieve unity in the Muslim League.<ref name=\"brightpk.com\" />{{unreliable source?|date=May 2012}} While in Lahore he was a friend of [[Abdul Sattar Ranjoor]].<ref name=\"n\">''New Age Weekly''.

Discontent with factional leaders like Shafi and Fazl-ur-Rahman, Iqbal came to believe that only Jinnah was a political leader capable of preserving unity and fulfilling the League's objectives of Muslim political empowerment. Building a strong, personal correspondence with Jinnah, Iqbal was influential in convincing Jinnah to end his self-imposed exile in London, return to India and take charge of the League. Iqbal firmly believed that Jinnah was the only leader capable of drawing Indian Muslims to the League and maintaining party unity before the British and the Congress:\n\n{{quote|I know you are a busy man, but I do hope you won't mind my writing to you often, as you are the only Muslim in India today to whom the community has right to look up for safe guidance through the storm which is coming to North-West India and, perhaps, to the whole of India.<ref name=\"iqbalandpakmovement\" />\n}}\n\nWhile Iqbal espoused the idea of Muslim-majority provinces in 1930, Jinnah would continue to hold talks with the Congress through the decade and only officially embraced the goal of Pakistan in 1940. Some historians postulate that Jinnah always remained hopeful for an agreement with the Congress and never fully desired the partition of India.<ref name=\"jalal14\">Ayesha Jalal, ''The Sole Spokesman'', pp. 14</ref> Iqbal's close correspondence with Jinnah is speculated by some historians as having been responsible for Jinnah's embrace of the idea of Pakistan. Iqbal elucidated to Jinnah his vision of a separate Muslim state in a letter sent on 21 June 1937:\n\n{{quote|A separate federation of Muslim Provinces, reformed on the lines I have suggested above, is the only course by which we can secure a peaceful India and save Muslims from the domination of Non-Muslims. Why should not the Muslims of North-West India and [[Bengal]] be considered as nations entitled to self-determination just as other nations in India and outside India are.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />}}\n\nIqbal, serving as president of the Punjab Muslim League, criticised Jinnah's political actions, including a political agreement with Punjabi leader [[Sikandar Hayat Khan (Punjabi politician)| Sikandar Hyat Khan]], whom Iqbal saw as a representative of feudal classes and not committed to Islam as the core political philosophy. Nevertheless, Iqbal worked constantly to encourage Muslim leaders and masses to support Jinnah and the League. Speaking about the political future of Muslims in India, Iqbal said:\n{{quote|There is only one way out. Muslims should strengthen Jinnah's hands. They should join the Muslim League. Indian question, as is now being solved, can be countered by our united front against both the Hindus and the English. Without it, our demands are not going to be accepted. People say our demands smack of communalism, and This is sheer propaganda. These demands relate to the defense of our national existence. The united front can be formed under the leadership of the Muslim League. And the Muslim League can succeed only on account of Jinnah. Now none but Jinnah is capable of leading the Muslims.<ref name=\"iqbalandpakmovement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/person/movement/move_main.htm |title=Iqbal and Pakistan Movement |publisher=Allamaiqbal.com |date= |accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Revival of Islamic polity ==\n[[File:Iqbal-RahmatAli.jpg|thumb|left|Iqbal with [[Choudhary Rahmat Ali]] and other Muslim leaders]]\nIqbal's six English lectures were published in Lahore in 1930, and then by the [[Oxford University Press]] in 1934 in the book ''[[The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam]]''. The lectures had been delivered at [[Madras]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Aligarh]].<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> These lectures dwell on the role of Islam as a religion and as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> In these lectures Iqbal firmly rejects the political attitudes and conduct of Muslim politicians, whom he saw as morally misguided, attached to power and without any standing with the Muslim masses.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIqbal expressed fears that not only would [[secularism]] weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, but that India's [[Hindu]]-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture and political influence. In his travels to [[Egypt]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]], he promoted ideas of greater Islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nationalist differences.<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\" /> He also speculated on different political arrangements to guarantee Muslim political power; in a dialogue with Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]], Iqbal expressed his desire to see Indian provinces as autonomous units under the direct control of the British government and with no central Indian government. He envisaged autonomous Muslim regions in India. Under a single Indian union, he feared for Muslims, who would suffer in many respects, especially concerning their existentially separate entity as Muslims.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal was elected president of the Muslim League in 1930 at its session in [[Allahabad]] in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], as well as for the session in Lahore in 1932. In his [[Allahabad Address|presidential address]] on 29 December 1930 he outlined a vision of an independent state for Muslim-majority provinces in north-western India:<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\n{{quote|I would like to see the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North-West Frontier Province]], [[Sind province (1936\u20131955)|Sind]] and [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]] amalgamated into a single state. Self-government within the [[British Empire]], or without the British Empire, the formation of a consolidated Northwest Indian Muslim state appears to me to be the final destiny of the Muslims, at least of Northwest India.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />}}\n\nIn his speech, Iqbal emphasised that, unlike Christianity, Islam came with \"legal concepts\" with \"civic significance\", with its \"religious ideals\" considered as inseparable from social order: \"Therefore, if it means a displacement of the Islamic principle of solidarity, the construction of a policy on national lines, is simply unthinkable to a Muslim.\"<ref name=\"Naipaul\">{{cite book |last=Naipaul |first=V. S. |title=Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions Among the Converted Peoples |pages=250\u201352}}</ref> Iqbal thus stressed not only the need for the political unity of Muslim communities but the undesirability of blending the Muslim population into a wider society not based on Islamic principles.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nHe thus became the first politician to articulate what would become known as the ''[[Two-nation theory]]''\u2014that Muslims are a distinct nation and thus deserve political independence from other regions and communities of India. Even as he rejected secularism and nationalism he would not elucidate or specify if his ideal Islamic state would be a [[theocracy]], and criticised the \"intellectual attitudes\" of Islamic scholars ([[ulema]]) as having \"reduced the Law of Islam practically to the state of immobility\".<ref name=iqbal-2004-1934-131>{{cite book |title=The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam |edition=reprint |orig-year=1934| date=2004 |location=Lahore |publisher=Sang-e-Meel Publications |page=131 }}</ref>\n\nThe latter part of Iqbal's life was concentrated on political activity. He travelled across Europe and West Asia to garner political and financial support for the League. He reiterated the ideas of his 1932 address, and, during the third [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference]], he opposed the Congress and proposals for transfer of power without considerable autonomy or independence for Muslim provinces.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nHe would serve as president of the Punjab Muslim League, and would deliver speeches and publish articles in an attempt to rally Muslims across India as a single political entity. Iqbal consistently criticised feudal classes in Punjab as well as Muslim politicians opposed to the League. Many accounts of Iqbal's frustration toward Congress leadership were also pivotal in providing a vision for the two-nation theory.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Patron of ''Tolu-e-Islam'' ===\n[[File:TolueIslam1.jpg|thumb|Copy of the first issue of ''Tolu-e-Islam'']]\nIqbal was the first patron of ''[[Tolu-e-Islam (magazine)|Tolu-e-Islam]]'', a historical, political, religious and cultural journal of the Muslims of British India. For a long time, Iqbal wanted a journal to propagate his ideas and the aims and objectives of the [[All India Muslim League]].

The poems emphasise the spirit and self from a religious perspective. Many critics have called this Iqbal's finest poetic work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com|title=Asrar-e-Khudi|first=Allama Iqbal Academy |last=Official website|accessdate=30 May 2006}}</ref> In ''Asrar-i-Khudi'', Iqbal explains his philosophy of \"Khudi\", or \"Self\".<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /><ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\" /> Iqbal's use of the term \"Khudi\" is synonymous with the word [[Ruh|\"Rooh\"]] used in the Quran for a divine spark which is present in every human being, and was said by Iqbal to be present in [[Adam]], for which God ordered all of the angels to prostrate in front of Adam.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> Iqbal condemns self-destruction. For him, the aim of life is self-realization and self-knowledge. He charts the stages through which the \"Self\" has to pass before finally arriving at its point of perfection, enabling the knower of the \"Self\" to become a vice-regent of God.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIn his ''[[Rumuz-i-Bekhudi]]'' (''Hints of Selflessness''), Iqbal seeks to prove the Islamic way of life is the best code of conduct for a nation's viability. A person must keep his characteristics intact, he asserts, but once this is achieved, he should sacrifice his ambitions for the needs of the nation. Man cannot realise the \"Self\" outside of society. Published in 1917, this group of poems has as its main themes the ideal community,<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> Islamic ethical and social principles, and the relationship between the individual and society. Although he supports Islam, Iqbal also recognises the positive aspects of other religions. ''Rumuz-i-Bekhudi'' complements the emphasis on the self in ''Asrar-e-Khudi'' and the two collections are often put in the same volume under the title ''Asrar-i-Rumuz'' (''Hinting Secrets''). It is addressed to the world's Muslims.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's 1924 publication, the ''[[Payam-e-Mashriq]]'' (''The Message of the East''), is closely connected to the ''West-\u00f6stlicher Diwan'' by the German poet Goethe. Goethe bemoans the West having become too materialistic in outlook, and expects the East will provide a message of hope to resuscitate spiritual values. Iqbal styles his work as a reminder to the West of the importance of morality, religion, and civilisation by underlining the need for cultivating feeling, ardor, and dynamism. He asserts that an individual can never aspire to higher dimensions unless he learns of the nature of spirituality.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> In his first visit to Afghanistan, he presented ''Payam-e Mashreq'' to [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah Khan]]. In it, he admired the uprising of Afghanistan against the British Empire. In 1933, he was officially invited to Afghanistan to join the meetings regarding the establishment of [[Kabul University]].<ref name=\"A Spiritual Bridge between East and West\"/>\n\nThe ''[[Zabur-e-Ajam]]'' (''Persian Psalms''), published in 1927, includes the poems \"''Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed''\" (\"Garden of New Secrets\") and \"''[[Bandagi Nama]]''\" (\"Book of Slavery\"). In \"''Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed''\", Iqbal first poses questions, then answers them with the help of ancient and modern insight. \"''Bandagi Nama''\" denounces slavery and attempts to explain the spirit behind the fine arts of enslaved societies. Here, as in other books, Iqbal insists on remembering the past, doing well in the present and preparing for the future, while emphasising love, enthusiasm and energy to fulfill the ideal life.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's 1932 work, the ''[[Javed Nama]]'' (''Book of Javed''), is named after and in a manner addressed to his son, who is featured in the poems. It follows the examples of the works of [[Ibn Arabi]] and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', through [[magic realism|mystical and exaggerated depictions]] across time. Iqbal depicts himself as ''[[Zinda Rud]]'' (\"A stream full of life\") guided by Rumi, \"the master\", through various heavens and spheres and has the honour of approaching divinity and coming in contact with divine illuminations. In a passage reliving a historical period, Iqbal condemns the Muslims who were instrumental in the defeat and death of Nawab [[Siraj-ud-Daula]] of [[Bengal]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] of [[Mysore]] by betraying them for the benefit of the [[British East India Company|British colonists]], and thus delivering their country to the shackles of slavery. In the end, by addressing his son Javid, he speaks to the young people at large, and guides the \"new generation\".<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nHis love of the Persian language is evident in his works and poetry. He says in one of his poems:<ref>'' Kuliyat Iqbal'', Iqbal Academy Publications, 1990, Lahore, Pakistan</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|{{nastaliq|\u06af\u0631\u0686\u06c1 \u06c1\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0639\u0630\u0648\u0628\u062a \u0634\u06a9\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/works/poetry/persian/asrar/text/01.htm|title=1|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''garchi Hindi dar uz\u016bbat <u>sh</u>akkar ast''\n\n{{nastaliq|\u0637\u0631\u0632 \u06af\u0641\u062a\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u0631\u064a \u0634\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}\n\n''tarz-i guftar-i Dari <u>sh</u>irin tar ast''}}\n\nTranslation: ''Even though in sweetness [[Hindi]]* is sugar'' \u2013 ''(but) speech method in [[Dari language|Dari]] [a Persian dialect] is sweeter *''\n\n=== Urdu ===\nIqbal's ''[[Bang-e-Dara]]'' (''The Call of the Marching Bell''), his first collection of Urdu poetry, was published in 1924. It was written in three distinct phases of his life.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> The poems he wrote up to 1905\u2014the year he left for England\u2014reflect patriotism and the imagery of nature, including the \"''[[Tarana-e-Hind]]''\" (\"The Song of India\"),<ref name=\"A Spiritual Bridge between East and West\"/> and \"''[[Tarana-e-Milli]]''\" (\"The Song of the Community\"). The second set of poems date from 1905\u20131908, when Iqbal studied in Europe, and dwell upon the nature of [[European culture|European society]], which he emphasised had lost spiritual and religious values. This inspired Iqbal to write poems on the historical and cultural heritage of Islam and the Muslim community, with a global perspective. Iqbal urges the entire Muslim community, addressed as the ''[[Ummah]]'', to define personal, social and political existence by the values and teachings of Islam.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's works were in Persian for most of his career, but after 1930 his works were mainly in Urdu. His works in this period were often specifically directed at the Muslim masses of India, with an even stronger emphasis on Islam and Muslim spiritual and political reawakening. Published in 1935, ''[[Gabriel's Wing|Bal-e-Jibril]]'' (''Wings of [[Gabriel]]'') is considered by many critics as his finest Urdu poetry and was inspired by his visit to Spain, where he visited the monuments and legacy of the [[Al-Andalus|kingdom of the Moors]]. It consists of [[ghazals]], poems, [[quatrains]] and [[epigrams]] and carries a strong sense of religious passion.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\n''[[What should then be done O people of the East|Pas Cheh Bayed Kard ai Aqwam-e-Sharq]]'' (''What are we to do, O Nations of the East?'') includes the poem \"''Musafir''\" (\"Traveler\"). Again, Iqbal depicts Rumi as a character and gives an exposition of the mysteries of [[Shariah|Islamic laws]] and Sufi perceptions. Iqbal laments the dissension and disunity among the Indian Muslims as well as Muslim nations. \"''Musafir''\" is an account of one of Iqbal's journeys to Afghanistan, in which the [[Pashtun people]] are counseled to learn the \"secret of Islam\" and to \"build up the self\" within themselves.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> Iqbal's final work was ''[[Gift from Hijaz|Armughan-e-Hijaz]]'' (''The Gift of Hijaz''), published posthumously in 1938. The first part contains quatrains in Persian, and the second part contains some poems and epigrams in Urdu. The Persian quatrains convey the impression that the poet is travelling through the [[Hijaz]] in his imagination. The profundity of ideas and intensity of passion are the salient features of these short poems.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's vision of mystical experience is clear in one of his Urdu ghazals, which was written in London during his student days.

He received considerable recognition from the Punjabi elite after his return from [[England]] in 1908, and he was closely associated with [[Mian Muhammad Shafi]]. When the [[All-India Muslim League]] was expanded to the provincial level, and Shafi received a significant role in the structural organisation of the [[Punjab Muslim League]], Iqbal was made one of the first three joint secretaries along with Shaikh Abdul Aziz and Maulvi Mahbub Alam.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of the All-India Muslim League (1906\u20131947)|last=Afzal|first=Rafique M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-19-906735-0|location=Karachi, Pakistan|pages=15}}</ref> While dividing his time between law practice and poetry, Iqbal remained active in the Muslim League. He did not support Indian involvement in [[World War I]] and stayed in close touch with Muslim political leaders such as [[Mohammad Ali Jouhar]] and [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. He was a critic of the mainstream [[Indian National Congress]], which he regarded as dominated by [[Hindus]], and was disappointed with the League when, during the 1920s, it was absorbed in factional divides between the pro-British group led by Shafi and the centrist group led by Jinnah.<ref name=\"brightpk.com\" />{{unreliable source?|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn November 1926, with the encouragement of friends and supporters, Iqbal contested the election for a seat in the [[Punjab Legislative Assembly]] from the Muslim district of Lahore, and defeated his opponent by a margin of 3,177 votes.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> He supported the [[Fourteen Points of Jinnah|constitutional proposals]] presented by Jinnah to guarantee Muslim political rights and influence in a coalition with the Congress and worked with the [[Aga Khan]] and other Muslim leaders to mend the factional divisions and achieve unity in the Muslim League.<ref name=\"brightpk.com\" />{{unreliable source?|date=May 2012}} While in Lahore he was a friend of [[Abdul Sattar Ranjoor]].<ref name=\"n\">''New Age Weekly''.

Discontent with factional leaders like Shafi and Fazl-ur-Rahman, Iqbal came to believe that only Jinnah was a political leader capable of preserving unity and fulfilling the League's objectives of Muslim political empowerment. Building a strong, personal correspondence with Jinnah, Iqbal was influential in convincing Jinnah to end his self-imposed exile in London, return to India and take charge of the League. Iqbal firmly believed that Jinnah was the only leader capable of drawing Indian Muslims to the League and maintaining party unity before the British and the Congress:\n\n{{quote|I know you are a busy man, but I do hope you won't mind my writing to you often, as you are the only Muslim in India today to whom the community has right to look up for safe guidance through the storm which is coming to North-West India and, perhaps, to the whole of India.<ref name=\"iqbalandpakmovement\" />\n}}\n\nWhile Iqbal espoused the idea of Muslim-majority provinces in 1930, Jinnah would continue to hold talks with the Congress through the decade and only officially embraced the goal of Pakistan in 1940. Some historians postulate that Jinnah always remained hopeful for an agreement with the Congress and never fully desired the partition of India.<ref name=\"jalal14\">Ayesha Jalal, ''The Sole Spokesman'', pp. 14</ref> Iqbal's close correspondence with Jinnah is speculated by some historians as having been responsible for Jinnah's embrace of the idea of Pakistan. Iqbal elucidated to Jinnah his vision of a separate Muslim state in a letter sent on 21 June 1937:\n\n{{quote|A separate federation of Muslim Provinces, reformed on the lines I have suggested above, is the only course by which we can secure a peaceful India and save Muslims from the domination of Non-Muslims. Why should not the Muslims of North-West India and [[Bengal]] be considered as nations entitled to self-determination just as other nations in India and outside India are.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />}}\n\nIqbal, serving as president of the Punjab Muslim League, criticised Jinnah's political actions, including a political agreement with Punjabi leader [[Sikandar Hayat Khan (Punjabi politician)| Sikandar Hyat Khan]], whom Iqbal saw as a representative of feudal classes and not committed to Islam as the core political philosophy. Nevertheless, Iqbal worked constantly to encourage Muslim leaders and masses to support Jinnah and the League. Speaking about the political future of Muslims in India, Iqbal said:\n{{quote|There is only one way out. Muslims should strengthen Jinnah's hands. They should join the Muslim League. Indian question, as is now being solved, can be countered by our united front against both the Hindus and the English. Without it, our demands are not going to be accepted. People say our demands smack of communalism, and This is sheer propaganda. These demands relate to the defense of our national existence. The united front can be formed under the leadership of the Muslim League. And the Muslim League can succeed only on account of Jinnah. Now none but Jinnah is capable of leading the Muslims.<ref name=\"iqbalandpakmovement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/person/movement/move_main.htm |title=Iqbal and Pakistan Movement |publisher=Allamaiqbal.com |date= |accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Revival of Islamic polity ==\n[[File:Iqbal-RahmatAli.jpg|thumb|left|Iqbal with [[Choudhary Rahmat Ali]] and other Muslim leaders]]\nIqbal's six English lectures were published in Lahore in 1930, and then by the [[Oxford University Press]] in 1934 in the book ''[[The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam]]''. The lectures had been delivered at [[Madras]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Aligarh]].<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> These lectures dwell on the role of Islam as a religion and as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> In these lectures Iqbal firmly rejects the political attitudes and conduct of Muslim politicians, whom he saw as morally misguided, attached to power and without any standing with the Muslim masses.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIqbal expressed fears that not only would [[secularism]] weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, but that India's [[Hindu]]-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture and political influence. In his travels to [[Egypt]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]], he promoted ideas of greater Islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nationalist differences.<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\" /> He also speculated on different political arrangements to guarantee Muslim political power; in a dialogue with Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]], Iqbal expressed his desire to see Indian provinces as autonomous units under the direct control of the British government and with no central Indian government. He envisaged autonomous Muslim regions in India. Under a single Indian union, he feared for Muslims, who would suffer in many respects, especially concerning their existentially separate entity as Muslims.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal was elected president of the Muslim League in 1930 at its session in [[Allahabad]] in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], as well as for the session in Lahore in 1932. In his [[Allahabad Address|presidential address]] on 29 December 1930 he outlined a vision of an independent state for Muslim-majority provinces in north-western India:<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\n{{quote|I would like to see the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North-West Frontier Province]], [[Sind province (1936\u20131955)|Sind]] and [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]] amalgamated into a single state. Self-government within the [[British Empire]], or without the British Empire, the formation of a consolidated Northwest Indian Muslim state appears to me to be the final destiny of the Muslims, at least of Northwest India.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />}}\n\nIn his speech, Iqbal emphasised that, unlike Christianity, Islam came with \"legal concepts\" with \"civic significance\", with its \"religious ideals\" considered as inseparable from social order: \"Therefore, if it means a displacement of the Islamic principle of solidarity, the construction of a policy on national lines, is simply unthinkable to a Muslim.\"<ref name=\"Naipaul\">{{cite book |last=Naipaul |first=V. S. |title=Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions Among the Converted Peoples |pages=250\u201352}}</ref> Iqbal thus stressed not only the need for the political unity of Muslim communities but the undesirability of blending the Muslim population into a wider society not based on Islamic principles.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nHe thus became the first politician to articulate what would become known as the ''[[Two-nation theory]]''\u2014that Muslims are a distinct nation and thus deserve political independence from other regions and communities of India. Even as he rejected secularism and nationalism he would not elucidate or specify if his ideal Islamic state would be a [[theocracy]], and criticised the \"intellectual attitudes\" of Islamic scholars ([[ulema]]) as having \"reduced the Law of Islam practically to the state of immobility\".<ref name=iqbal-2004-1934-131>{{cite book |title=The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam |edition=reprint |orig-year=1934| date=2004 |location=Lahore |publisher=Sang-e-Meel Publications |page=131 }}</ref>\n\nThe latter part of Iqbal's life was concentrated on political activity. He travelled across Europe and West Asia to garner political and financial support for the League. He reiterated the ideas of his 1932 address, and, during the third [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference]], he opposed the Congress and proposals for transfer of power without considerable autonomy or independence for Muslim provinces.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nHe would serve as president of the Punjab Muslim League, and would deliver speeches and publish articles in an attempt to rally Muslims across India as a single political entity. Iqbal consistently criticised feudal classes in Punjab as well as Muslim politicians opposed to the League. Many accounts of Iqbal's frustration toward Congress leadership were also pivotal in providing a vision for the two-nation theory.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Patron of ''Tolu-e-Islam'' ===\n[[File:TolueIslam1.jpg|thumb|Copy of the first issue of ''Tolu-e-Islam'']]\nIqbal was the first patron of ''[[Tolu-e-Islam (magazine)|Tolu-e-Islam]]'', a historical, political, religious and cultural journal of the Muslims of British India. For a long time, Iqbal wanted a journal to propagate his ideas and the aims and objectives of the [[All India Muslim League]].

The poems emphasise the spirit and self from a religious perspective. Many critics have called this Iqbal's finest poetic work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com|title=Asrar-e-Khudi|first=Allama Iqbal Academy |last=Official website|accessdate=30 May 2006}}</ref> In ''Asrar-i-Khudi'', Iqbal explains his philosophy of \"Khudi\", or \"Self\".<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /><ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\" /> Iqbal's use of the term \"Khudi\" is synonymous with the word [[Ruh|\"Rooh\"]] used in the Quran for a divine spark which is present in every human being, and was said by Iqbal to be present in [[Adam]], for which God ordered all of the angels to prostrate in front of Adam.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> Iqbal condemns self-destruction. For him, the aim of life is self-realization and self-knowledge. He charts the stages through which the \"Self\" has to pass before finally arriving at its point of perfection, enabling the knower of the \"Self\" to become a vice-regent of God.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIn his ''[[Rumuz-i-Bekhudi]]'' (''Hints of Selflessness''), Iqbal seeks to prove the Islamic way of life is the best code of conduct for a nation's viability. A person must keep his characteristics intact, he asserts, but once this is achieved, he should sacrifice his ambitions for the needs of the nation. Man cannot realise the \"Self\" outside of society. Published in 1917, this group of poems has as its main themes the ideal community,<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> Islamic ethical and social principles, and the relationship between the individual and society. Although he supports Islam, Iqbal also recognises the positive aspects of other religions. ''Rumuz-i-Bekhudi'' complements the emphasis on the self in ''Asrar-e-Khudi'' and the two collections are often put in the same volume under the title ''Asrar-i-Rumuz'' (''Hinting Secrets''). It is addressed to the world's Muslims.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's 1924 publication, the ''[[Payam-e-Mashriq]]'' (''The Message of the East''), is closely connected to the ''West-\u00f6stlicher Diwan'' by the German poet Goethe. Goethe bemoans the West having become too materialistic in outlook, and expects the East will provide a message of hope to resuscitate spiritual values. Iqbal styles his work as a reminder to the West of the importance of morality, religion, and civilisation by underlining the need for cultivating feeling, ardor, and dynamism. He asserts that an individual can never aspire to higher dimensions unless he learns of the nature of spirituality.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> In his first visit to Afghanistan, he presented ''Payam-e Mashreq'' to [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah Khan]]. In it, he admired the uprising of Afghanistan against the British Empire. In 1933, he was officially invited to Afghanistan to join the meetings regarding the establishment of [[Kabul University]].<ref name=\"A Spiritual Bridge between East and West\"/>\n\nThe ''[[Zabur-e-Ajam]]'' (''Persian Psalms''), published in 1927, includes the poems \"''Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed''\" (\"Garden of New Secrets\") and \"''[[Bandagi Nama]]''\" (\"Book of Slavery\"). In \"''Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed''\", Iqbal first poses questions, then answers them with the help of ancient and modern insight. \"''Bandagi Nama''\" denounces slavery and attempts to explain the spirit behind the fine arts of enslaved societies. Here, as in other books, Iqbal insists on remembering the past, doing well in the present and preparing for the future, while emphasising love, enthusiasm and energy to fulfill the ideal life.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's 1932 work, the ''[[Javed Nama]]'' (''Book of Javed''), is named after and in a manner addressed to his son, who is featured in the poems. It follows the examples of the works of [[Ibn Arabi]] and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', through [[magic realism|mystical and exaggerated depictions]] across time. Iqbal depicts himself as ''[[Zinda Rud]]'' (\"A stream full of life\") guided by Rumi, \"the master\", through various heavens and spheres and has the honour of approaching divinity and coming in contact with divine illuminations. In a passage reliving a historical period, Iqbal condemns the Muslims who were instrumental in the defeat and death of Nawab [[Siraj-ud-Daula]] of [[Bengal]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] of [[Mysore]] by betraying them for the benefit of the [[British East India Company|British colonists]], and thus delivering their country to the shackles of slavery. In the end, by addressing his son Javid, he speaks to the young people at large, and guides the \"new generation\".<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nHis love of the Persian language is evident in his works and poetry. He says in one of his poems:<ref>'' Kuliyat Iqbal'', Iqbal Academy Publications, 1990, Lahore, Pakistan</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|{{nastaliq|\u06af\u0631\u0686\u06c1 \u06c1\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0639\u0630\u0648\u0628\u062a \u0634\u06a9\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/works/poetry/persian/asrar/text/01.htm|title=1|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''garchi Hindi dar uz\u016bbat <u>sh</u>akkar ast''\n\n{{nastaliq|\u0637\u0631\u0632 \u06af\u0641\u062a\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u0631\u064a \u0634\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}\n\n''tarz-i guftar-i Dari <u>sh</u>irin tar ast''}}\n\nTranslation: ''Even though in sweetness [[Hindi]]* is sugar'' \u2013 ''(but) speech method in [[Dari language|Dari]] [a Persian dialect] is sweeter *''\n\n=== Urdu ===\nIqbal's ''[[Bang-e-Dara]]'' (''The Call of the Marching Bell''), his first collection of Urdu poetry, was published in 1924. It was written in three distinct phases of his life.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> The poems he wrote up to 1905\u2014the year he left for England\u2014reflect patriotism and the imagery of nature, including the \"''[[Tarana-e-Hind]]''\" (\"The Song of India\"),<ref name=\"A Spiritual Bridge between East and West\"/> and \"''[[Tarana-e-Milli]]''\" (\"The Song of the Community\"). The second set of poems date from 1905\u20131908, when Iqbal studied in Europe, and dwell upon the nature of [[European culture|European society]], which he emphasised had lost spiritual and religious values. This inspired Iqbal to write poems on the historical and cultural heritage of Islam and the Muslim community, with a global perspective. Iqbal urges the entire Muslim community, addressed as the ''[[Ummah]]'', to define personal, social and political existence by the values and teachings of Islam.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's works were in Persian for most of his career, but after 1930 his works were mainly in Urdu. His works in this period were often specifically directed at the Muslim masses of India, with an even stronger emphasis on Islam and Muslim spiritual and political reawakening. Published in 1935, ''[[Gabriel's Wing|Bal-e-Jibril]]'' (''Wings of [[Gabriel]]'') is considered by many critics as his finest Urdu poetry and was inspired by his visit to Spain, where he visited the monuments and legacy of the [[Al-Andalus|kingdom of the Moors]]. It consists of [[ghazals]], poems, [[quatrains]] and [[epigrams]] and carries a strong sense of religious passion.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\n''[[What should then be done O people of the East|Pas Cheh Bayed Kard ai Aqwam-e-Sharq]]'' (''What are we to do, O Nations of the East?'') includes the poem \"''Musafir''\" (\"Traveler\"). Again, Iqbal depicts Rumi as a character and gives an exposition of the mysteries of [[Shariah|Islamic laws]] and Sufi perceptions. Iqbal laments the dissension and disunity among the Indian Muslims as well as Muslim nations. \"''Musafir''\" is an account of one of Iqbal's journeys to Afghanistan, in which the [[Pashtun people]] are counseled to learn the \"secret of Islam\" and to \"build up the self\" within themselves.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> Iqbal's final work was ''[[Gift from Hijaz|Armughan-e-Hijaz]]'' (''The Gift of Hijaz''), published posthumously in 1938. The first part contains quatrains in Persian, and the second part contains some poems and epigrams in Urdu. The Persian quatrains convey the impression that the poet is travelling through the [[Hijaz]] in his imagination. The profundity of ideas and intensity of passion are the salient features of these short poems.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's vision of mystical experience is clear in one of his Urdu ghazals, which was written in London during his student days.

Within the next few years the band's website featured rare updates and touring seemed to halt which led to rumors of the band's demise. However, The Insyderz had become tired of record label politics and until business had been sorted out continued to perform on a much smaller scale. Many of the members of the band married including Nate Sjogren (drums), Bram Roberts (Trumpet), Beau McCarthy (Bass), Kyle Wasil (Guitar), and Joe Yerke (vocals). The band decided to spend more time working and ministering through other projects while never fully disbanding. Nate Sjogren, for instance, left to start a youth oriented church in Michigan with the help of the Salvation Army.<ref name=\"7b_29\">{{cite journal |title=news / Progressive |pages=16 |date=March\u2013April 2000 |issue=29 |journal=[[7ball]] |issn=1082-3980}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001 a compilation CD entitled ''[[The Greatest & The Rarest]]'' (or alternately ''Tails of a Comet'') was released, which consists of fifteen popular songs from their first four albums and six rare songs.\n\nIn 2003 they re-activated, appearing at [[Cornerstone Festival|Cornerstone]],<ref name=\"HM_Cstone_03\">{{cite journal |last=Wilkinson |first=Aaron |year=2003 |title=Cornerstone FL 2003 |journal=[[HM Magazine]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.hmmagazine.com/oe/archives/000180.php |format= |accessdate=2007-02-01}}</ref> and releasing an album entitled ''[[Soundtrack to a Revolution]]''. After the release the Insyderz went through another lineup change adding [[Royce Nunley]] ([[Suicide Machines]]) and Dan Powers ([[Blueprint 76]]) on bass.\n\nIn the first half of 2005, the band announced on their website that they would be playing their last three shows in August and September of that year, which led to confusion on whether they were the band's last three shows or the tour's last three. Later, in August of the same year, the site was updated to announce that the band would be breaking up after their final show on September 24, 2005, as a part of the I'll Fight Fest presented by [[The Salvation Army]]. The show was performed with [[The O.C. Supertones]] who were also in the midst of a final tour. In 2009, the band got back together and in 2012, they released The Sinner's Songbook. In 2012, they did a short tour with Five Iron Frenzy, but have remained inactive in the past several years due to the band member's work schedules and family life. \n\n===Post break up===\nNate Sjogren has played drums in several other projects including ''Dead By Sunday'', ''The Paper Sound'', and the singer/songwriter ''[http://www.james-stephen.com James Stephen]''.\n\nIn December 2007, Todd, along with wife Sarah, welcomed their first child, a girl named Harper Rose Miesch.

However, trombone duties were usually performed by Tim Reynolds.

Within the next few years the band's website featured rare updates and touring seemed to halt which led to rumors of the band's demise. However, The Insyderz had become tired of record label politics and until business had been sorted out continued to perform on a much smaller scale. Many of the members of the band married including Nate Sjogren (drums), Bram Roberts (Trumpet), Beau McCarthy (Bass), Kyle Wasil (Guitar), and Joe Yerke (vocals). The band decided to spend more time working and ministering through other projects while never fully disbanding. Nate Sjogren, for instance, left to start a youth oriented church in Michigan with the help of the Salvation Army.<ref name=\"7b_29\">{{cite journal |title=news / Progressive |pages=16 |date=March\u2013April 2000 |issue=29 |journal=[[7ball]] |issn=1082-3980}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001 a compilation CD entitled ''[[The Greatest & The Rarest]]'' (or alternately ''Tails of a Comet'') was released, which consists of fifteen popular songs from their first four albums and six rare songs.\n\nIn 2003 they re-activated, appearing at [[Cornerstone Festival|Cornerstone]],<ref name=\"HM_Cstone_03\">{{cite journal |last=Wilkinson |first=Aaron |year=2003 |title=Cornerstone FL 2003 |journal=[[HM Magazine]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.hmmagazine.com/oe/archives/000180.php |format= |accessdate=2007-02-01}}</ref> and releasing an album entitled ''[[Soundtrack to a Revolution]]''. After the release the Insyderz went through another lineup change adding [[Royce Nunley]] ([[Suicide Machines]]) and Dan Powers ([[Blueprint 76]]) on bass.\n\nIn the first half of 2005, the band announced on their website that they would be playing their last three shows in August and September of that year, which led to confusion on whether they were the band's last three shows or the tour's last three. Later, in August of the same year, the site was updated to announce that the band would be breaking up after their final show on September 24, 2005, as a part of the I'll Fight Fest presented by [[The Salvation Army]]. The show was performed with [[The O.C. Supertones]] who were also in the midst of a final tour. In 2009, the band got back together and in 2012, they released The Sinner's Songbook. In 2012, they did a short tour with Five Iron Frenzy, but have remained inactive in the past several years due to the band member's work schedules and family life. \n\n===Post break up===\nNate Sjogren has played drums in several other projects including ''Dead By Sunday'', ''The Paper Sound'', and the singer/songwriter ''[http://www.james-stephen.com James Stephen]''.\n\nIn December 2007, Todd, along with wife Sarah, welcomed their first child, a girl named Harper Rose Miesch.

According to Chevelle frontman [[Pete Loeffler]], Albini gave their album an unrefined \"[[indie rock|indie]] feel\" in which the recording process was essentially \"plug in, he hits record, and you play.\" Loeffler added, \"At the time I was shocked talking to someone who had worked closely to [[Kurt Cobain]]. It was a trip. It was really cool.\" ''Point #1'' was recorded in [[D tuning|standard D]] with an [[alternative metal]] approach. However, the band was left unsatisfied and feeling that he didn't achieve the tones and overall sound they were looking for. They called Albini and, much to his surprise, expressed disappointment with the final product. Although they enjoyed working with him, Chevelle wanted to find a different producer to resolve the issue; however, their label gave them no choice but to work with Albini once again. The second phase of recording was, according to Loeffler, much more laid back and relaxed in which Albini \"really opened up.\"<ref>Van Pelt, Doug [https://archive.is/20130126002603/http://www.hmmagazine.com/exclusive/chevelle_interview_wpete_703200307/index.php?page=1 Chevelle - Interview w/Pete 7/03] ''HM'' (July 2003).

Nevertheless, the band's major label debut, ''[[Wonder What's Next]]'', has since been regarded by the band as their \"first\" album.<ref>Klodz, Randy J.

The following year, \"Mia\" would be released as a follow-up. It also had a video.\n\n==Reception==\nCritical reception for ''Point #1'' varied.

The album featured a notable single in its title track but achieved only minor success, especially compared to Chevelle's [[Wonder What's Next|major label follow-up]] in 2002.\n\n==Background and recording==\nAfter recording a demo, Chevelle played small concerts for three years until being signed to [[Steve Taylor]]'s [[independent record label|independent]] [[Christian music industry|Christian label]] [[Squint Entertainment]].<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web| author=Frey, Tracy |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p370474/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Chevelle Biography - Allmusic |website=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=December 28, 2007}}</ref> The band recorded for 17 days in [[Electrical Audio]] studios<ref>{{Cite book |last= Albini |first= Steve |author-link= Steve Albini |year= 1999 |title= The Problem with Music |periodical= [[The Baffler]] |publication-place= Chicago |publisher= [[Thomas Frank]] |issue= 5 |pages= |url= http://www.negativland.com/albini.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928182458/http://www.negativland.com/albini.html |archivedate= September 28, 2007 |issn= 1059-9789 |oclc= 24838556 }}, also [https://web.archive.org/web/20061115070529/http://www.thebaffler.com/albiniexcerpt.html archived from the dead ''Baffler'' site].

According to Chevelle frontman [[Pete Loeffler]], Albini gave their album an unrefined \"[[indie rock|indie]] feel\" in which the recording process was essentially \"plug in, he hits record, and you play.\" Loeffler added, \"At the time I was shocked talking to someone who had worked closely to [[Kurt Cobain]]. It was a trip. It was really cool.\" ''Point #1'' was recorded in [[D tuning|standard D]] with an [[alternative metal]] approach. However, the band was left unsatisfied and feeling that he didn't achieve the tones and overall sound they were looking for. They called Albini and, much to his surprise, expressed disappointment with the final product. Although they enjoyed working with him, Chevelle wanted to find a different producer to resolve the issue; however, their label gave them no choice but to work with Albini once again. The second phase of recording was, according to Loeffler, much more laid back and relaxed in which Albini \"really opened up.\"<ref>Van Pelt, Doug [https://archive.is/20130126002603/http://www.hmmagazine.com/exclusive/chevelle_interview_wpete_703200307/index.php?page=1 Chevelle - Interview w/Pete 7/03] ''HM'' (July 2003).

Nevertheless, the band's major label debut, ''[[Wonder What's Next]]'', has since been regarded by the band as their \"first\" album.<ref>Klodz, Randy J.

This would influence their shift to a heavier sound on future albums.\n\nAlbini and an aspiring comedian named [[Fred Armisen]] starred in the band's [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8v8YVA-qnI ''Point #1 EPK''] (electronic press kit)\u2014several years before Armisen became famous on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Several months after the album's debut, a single was released in the title track which landed a marginal spot on [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] and had an accompanying music video. The following year, \"Mia\" would be released as a follow-up. It also had a video.\n\n==Reception==\nCritical reception for ''Point #1'' varied. Heather Phares of [[Allmusic]] gave a positive review, noting how Albini helped the band \"create forceful, mercurial indie rock\" and added \"In line with Chicago's ambitious music scene, Chevelle's challenging take on rock is also a rewarding one.\"\n\nChevelle received [[GMA Dove Award]]s for the more popular song \"Mia\" in 2000 and \"Point #1\" in 2001.<ref name=\"DOVE_HS\">\"{{cite web| url=http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?cid=32| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020106001828/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?cid=32| archivedate=January 6, 2002 |title=Dove Award Recipients for Hard Music Recorded Song |publisher=[[Gospel Music Association]] |accessdate=November 15, 2006}}</ref> The album also received an award for \"Hard Music Album\" in 2000 by the Dove Awards.<ref name=\"DOVE_00\">\"{{cite web| url=http://doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=2000| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020406020434/http://doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=2000| archivedate=April 6, 2002 |title=Dove Award Recipients for Hard Music Album |publisher=Gospel Music Association |accessdate=November 15, 2006}}</ref>\n\n''Point #1'' has earned Chevelle many comparisons to the successful [[progressive metal]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]].<ref>Button, Israel.

(He had previously sung with Louie Auten and the Tennessee Valley Boys.)<ref name=ea/> After that, he sang with three of his brothers as the Hess Brothers Quartet. He also sang with the Sunny South Quartet and their rival, the Melody Masters Quartet. In the latter part of his life, Hess sang with [[The Old Friends Quartet]] which was featured on the Bill Gaither Homecoming videos.\n\n===Statesmen Quartet===\nHess sang lead with the [[Statesmen Quartet]] from 1948 until 1963.<ref name=sn/> Their recordings included projects long-term with RCA Victor. In 1977-1978 Hess reunited with the surviving members of [[The Statesmen Quartet]], [[Hovie Lister]], Doy Ott, and Rosie Rozell to record three projects, including \"Songs [[Elvis]] Loved\". The reunited Statesmen had sung at Elvis's funeral. In the fall of 1980, Hess, Lister, and Rozell assembled a new group with James Blackwood and [[J.D. Sumner]]. As a result, the southern gospel group the [[Masters V]] was born. They toured from 1981 until 1988 when illnesses prompted several of the members to retire from full-time singing.\n\n===The Imperials===\nUpon leaving the Statesmen Quartet at the end of 1963, Hess formed his \"dream\" group, [[the Imperials]].<ref name=sn/> Although they were not immediately accepted by his peers because of their innovative use of electric guitars and drums, they went on to become pioneers in [[Contemporary Christian Music]], and would eventually be inducted into the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]]. They backed [[Elvis Presley]] from 1966 to 1971. Elvis has been quoted as noting Hess as his favorite singer. Hess left the Imperials in 1967 due to health problems.\n\n===The Jake Hess Sound===\nHess also sang with his children, Becky and Chris, in a group he named \"The Jake Hess Sound\". In the late 1970s, Hess and his son Chris were featured singers on the television broadcasts of evangelist Dr. [[Gene Scott]].\n\n===With Elvis Presley===\nJake Hess was an idol of Presley, was a major influence, and sang at Elvis's funeral. Hess also sang backup on several albums that were recorded by Elvis.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/11/nyregion/jake-hess-76-gospel-pioneer-and-inspiration-to-presley.html?_r=0</ref>\n\n===Solo career===\nJake Hess was a noted soloist in his own right. He had won several Grammy Awards on RCA Victor as a solo artist. His last 12 years, he appeared on the [[Gaither Homecoming]] concerts and videos. These videos featured Hess from noted concerts in the U.S. at the [[Kennedy Center]], the [[Ryman Auditorium]], and [[Hawaii]]an islands and Europe.\n\n===Television===\nHess had ''The Jake Hess Show'' on [[WTVF|WLAC]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and performed in the ''Old Time Singing Convention''.<ref name=\"bb101070\">{{cite news|title=Jake Hess 30 Years in Gospel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jCkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA56&lpg=RA1-PA56&dq=%22Jake+Hess%22+%22Music+City+Singers%22&source=bl&ots=QCRYKgFxOS&sig=2aR_Dn9ePFSSsoL_5ojHdncvjtE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VUgPVa3CA8ulNrL-gKAB&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22Jake%20Hess%22%20%22Music%20City%20Singers%22&f=false|accessdate=22 March 2015|agency=Billboard|date=October 10, 1970|page=56}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nHess and Joyce McWaters were married on October 5, 1952.

Jake accompanied them to the studio and liked what he heard. While visiting with Jake in Brentwood, Jake asked if they would be interested in forming with him a new version of Jake Hess & Friends. The group would ultimately consist of Jake, Steve, Eugene & Chris, Jake's son. They started rehearsals in Jake's family room and started touring later in the year. There were several dates in Missouri and Florida, but Jake determined that the travelling was going to be more demanding than he anticipated, so by 1990 the tours were put on hold with the possibility of doing something with television.\n\nJake Hess III [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHlkagXiv1p082giVhuCNzA] continues the family's musical heritage by singing in the highly acclaimed

Pp. 201-202.</ref>\n\n==Life==\nThe son of \"a sharecropper who was a shape-note singing-school teacher,\" Hess was born in Mt. Pisgah,<ref name=bb/> near Athens,<ref name=eagm/> in [[Limestone County, Alabama]]. His parents were Stovall and Lydia Hess. He was the youngest of 12 children.<ref name=sn>{{cite news|last1=Kirksey|first1=Jerry|title=Jake Hess funeral arrangements|url=http://singingnews.com/news/11590608/|accessdate=10 July 2016|work=singingnews|date=January 5, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822064517/http://singingnews.com/news/11590608/|archive-date=22 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHess's entry on the [[Encyclopedia of Alabama|Encyclopedia of Alabama's]] website says of his name: \"His parents did not officially name him, so the attending physician entered his name as 'Man Child' Hess in official documents.\"<ref name=\"ea\">{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Greg|title=Jake Hess|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3435|website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhen he registered with the draft board in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], he gave his name as \"William Jesse Hess.\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} In 1997, when Hess was preparing to get a passport to travel overseas, he discovered that his birth certificate actually read Manchild Hess.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} His son, Jake Jr., named his recording company Manchild Records in honor of his father.\n\n==Career==\nHess' career started at the age of 16, when he joined the popular John Daniel Quartet in 1943,<ref name=wp/> making his recorded debut on \"Just a Prayer Away\". (He had previously sung with Louie Auten and the Tennessee Valley Boys.)<ref name=ea/> After that, he sang with three of his brothers as the Hess Brothers Quartet. He also sang with the Sunny South Quartet and their rival, the Melody Masters Quartet. In the latter part of his life, Hess sang with [[The Old Friends Quartet]] which was featured on the Bill Gaither Homecoming videos.\n\n===Statesmen Quartet===\nHess sang lead with the [[Statesmen Quartet]] from 1948 until 1963.<ref name=sn/> Their recordings included projects long-term with RCA Victor. In 1977-1978 Hess reunited with the surviving members of [[The Statesmen Quartet]], [[Hovie Lister]], Doy Ott, and Rosie Rozell to record three projects, including \"Songs [[Elvis]] Loved\". The reunited Statesmen had sung at Elvis's funeral. In the fall of 1980, Hess, Lister, and Rozell assembled a new group with James Blackwood and [[J.D. Sumner]]. As a result, the southern gospel group the [[Masters V]] was born. They toured from 1981 until 1988 when illnesses prompted several of the members to retire from full-time singing.\n\n===The Imperials===\nUpon leaving the Statesmen Quartet at the end of 1963, Hess formed his \"dream\" group, [[the Imperials]].<ref name=sn/> Although they were not immediately accepted by his peers because of their innovative use of electric guitars and drums, they went on to become pioneers in [[Contemporary Christian Music]], and would eventually be inducted into the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]]. They backed [[Elvis Presley]] from 1966 to 1971. Elvis has been quoted as noting Hess as his favorite singer. Hess left the Imperials in 1967 due to health problems.\n\n===The Jake Hess Sound===\nHess also sang with his children, Becky and Chris, in a group he named \"The Jake Hess Sound\". In the late 1970s, Hess and his son Chris were featured singers on the television broadcasts of evangelist Dr. [[Gene Scott]].\n\n===With Elvis Presley===\nJake Hess was an idol of Presley, was a major influence, and sang at Elvis's funeral. Hess also sang backup on several albums that were recorded by Elvis.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/11/nyregion/jake-hess-76-gospel-pioneer-and-inspiration-to-presley.html?_r=0</ref>\n\n===Solo career===\nJake Hess was a noted soloist in his own right. He had won several Grammy Awards on RCA Victor as a solo artist. His last 12 years, he appeared on the [[Gaither Homecoming]] concerts and videos. These videos featured Hess from noted concerts in the U.S. at the [[Kennedy Center]], the [[Ryman Auditorium]], and [[Hawaii]]an islands and Europe.\n\n===Television===\nHess had ''The Jake Hess Show'' on [[WTVF|WLAC]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and performed in the ''Old Time Singing Convention''.<ref name=\"bb101070\">{{cite news|title=Jake Hess 30 Years in Gospel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jCkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA56&lpg=RA1-PA56&dq=%22Jake+Hess%22+%22Music+City+Singers%22&source=bl&ots=QCRYKgFxOS&sig=2aR_Dn9ePFSSsoL_5ojHdncvjtE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VUgPVa3CA8ulNrL-gKAB&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22Jake%20Hess%22%20%22Music%20City%20Singers%22&f=false|accessdate=22 March 2015|agency=Billboard|date=October 10, 1970|page=56}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nHess and Joyce McWaters were married on October 5, 1952. They had three children.<ref name=ea/>\n\nJake Hess, Jr. has become a well-known southern gospel songwriter, in addition to being married to Judy Martin of [[The Martins]].<ref name=crosswalk>{{cite web|title=Interview with The Martins|url=http://www.crosswalk.com/1108828/|publisher=crosswalk.com|accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref> In 1989 Jake's nephew Steve Hess & Eugene Baker (Hess & Baker, Skylite/Sing) were in Nashville to record several segments on Bobby Jones Gospel (BET Network). Jake accompanied them to the studio and liked what he heard. While visiting with Jake in Brentwood, Jake asked if they would be interested in forming with him a new version of Jake Hess & Friends. The group would ultimately consist of Jake, Steve, Eugene & Chris, Jake's son. They started rehearsals in Jake's family room and started touring later in the year. There were several dates in Missouri and Florida, but Jake determined that the travelling was going to be more demanding than he anticipated, so by 1990 the tours were put on hold with the possibility of doing something with television.\n\nJake Hess III [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHlkagXiv1p082giVhuCNzA] continues the family's musical heritage by singing in the highly acclaimed [http://www.voicesoflee.com/bio/ The Voices of Lee], part of [[Lee University]] in [[Cleveland, TN]].\n\n==Book==\nIn 1995, Hess's autobiography, ''Nothin' but Fine: The Music and the Gospel According

The fledgling trio also came to the attention of 1960s folk singer [[Barry McGuire]], who had recently become a Christian and was preparing to record his first Christian music album, produced by Buck Herring. The siblings provided background vocals for ''Seeds'' and McGuire's 1974 follow-up ''Lighten Up''.\n\nThe trio released their debut album, ''[[With Footnotes]]'', in 1974. This album featured \"[[Easter Song]]\" which would become a signature piece for the group and has been recorded by many other artists since. This was followed up with ''[[In the Volume of the Book]]'' in 1975, the year that also saw the release of a live album with Barry McGuire, ''[[To the Bride]]'', which included \"[[a band called David]]\", who supported 2nd Chapter of Acts on tour. 2nd Chapter of Acts' first three releases were issued by [[Myrrh Records]], and the group toured with McGuire intermittently for three years.\n\nThe group went on a touring hiatus in 1976. Annie released her first solo record on the [[Sparrow Records]] label founded that year by the executive who had signed them to the Myrrh label, [[Billy Ray Hearn]]. For the summer of 1977, they were joined on an 18-city tour by [[Phil Keaggy]] and the result was the live triple album, ''[[How the West Was One (2nd Chapter of Acts album)|How the West Was One]]''. Their contract with Myrrh fulfilled, they moved as a group to Sparrow.<ref name=\"2ndchapterofacts.com\"/>\n\nTheir Sparrow debut, ''[[Mansion Builder]]'' (1978) was followed up with ''[[The Roar of Love]]'' (1980) (a concept album inspired by [[C.

Both have continued to release new material and perform concerts as of 2011.\n\n== Roles of group members ==\n\nAnnie was the main songwriter of the group and the only one who played an instrument (piano). Her admittedly unschooled compositional style, with its frequent irregular rhythms, added somewhat progressive rock-like elements to what was otherwise a soft-rock sound. Matthew and Nelly initially made the occasional small contribution to the lyrics, and Matthew developed as a songwriter for the group as his solo career grew.\n\nAnnie and Matthew sang most of the solo parts. Nelly \u2014 whose voice could be hard to distinguish from Annie's \u2014 usually sang lead only on songs where each member took a verse (\"Which Way The Wind Blows\", \"Something Tells Me\", \"Takin' The Easy Way\") or on solo pieces without the others singing backup (\"I Don't Wanna Go Home\", \"Make My Life a Prayer\" and \"Mountain Tops\"). Vocal leads such as in \"My Jesus I Love Thee\" and \"Sing Over Me\", where she was backed by the others, were rare exceptions. Her voice was considered the \"glue\" to the 2nd Chapter of Acts sound, and her harmony parts were generally the most difficult to sing.\n\n== Discography ==\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n* 1974: ''[[With Footnotes]]''  (Myrrh)\n* 1975: ''[[In the Volume of the Book]]'' (Myrrh)\n* 1975: ''[[To the Bride]]'' (two LPs; with Barry McGuire and \"a band called David\") (Myrrh).

The group disbanded in 1988.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe 2nd Chapter of Acts began as a result of the trio singing at home together as Annie played the piano.

The fledgling trio also came to the attention of 1960s folk singer [[Barry McGuire]], who had recently become a Christian and was preparing to record his first Christian music album, produced by Buck Herring. The siblings provided background vocals for ''Seeds'' and McGuire's 1974 follow-up ''Lighten Up''.\n\nThe trio released their debut album, ''[[With Footnotes]]'', in 1974. This album featured \"[[Easter Song]]\" which would become a signature piece for the group and has been recorded by many other artists since. This was followed up with ''[[In the Volume of the Book]]'' in 1975, the year that also saw the release of a live album with Barry McGuire, ''[[To the Bride]]'', which included \"[[a band called David]]\", who supported 2nd Chapter of Acts on tour. 2nd Chapter of Acts' first three releases were issued by [[Myrrh Records]], and the group toured with McGuire intermittently for three years.\n\nThe group went on a touring hiatus in 1976. Annie released her first solo record on the [[Sparrow Records]] label founded that year by the executive who had signed them to the Myrrh label, [[Billy Ray Hearn]]. For the summer of 1977, they were joined on an 18-city tour by [[Phil Keaggy]] and the result was the live triple album, ''[[How the West Was One (2nd Chapter of Acts album)|How the West Was One]]''. Their contract with Myrrh fulfilled, they moved as a group to Sparrow.<ref name=\"2ndchapterofacts.com\"/>\n\nTheir Sparrow debut, ''[[Mansion Builder]]'' (1978) was followed up with ''[[The Roar of Love]]'' (1980) (a concept album inspired by [[C.

He began playing his grandmother's piano at the age of three. The first song he had learned was \"At the Cross.\" He was enrolled in piano lessons at age five. Dino received his professional training at [[The King's College (New York)|The King's College]] as well as the [[Juilliard School]] of Music.

He has worked with various other evangelists. \n\nDino has hosted two television shows, the \"Dino and Debby Show\" in the 1970s with his first wife Deborah Keener and \"The Dino Show\" which formerly aired on the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]].  Dino has described his style as combining the classical and the sacred. His technique has been described as fluid and brilliant and he has been termed the \"Christian Liberace\" because of his flair, costumes, pianos and jewelry.<ref name=\"The Christian Liberace\">{{cite web|last=Kartsonakis|first=Dino|title=Dino Dubbed \"The Christian Liberace\"|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-view/Dino.html|accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref> \n\nMany of his works are religious-based or contemporary arrangements of classical works.

He is known for his virtuosic arrangements of sacred music for the piano.\n\n==Biography==\nDino was born in [[New York City]] and attended Glad Tidings Tabernacle. He began playing his grandmother's piano at the age of three. The first song he had learned was \"At the Cross.\" He was enrolled in piano lessons at age five. Dino received his professional training at [[The King's College (New York)|The King's College]] as well as the [[Juilliard School]] of Music. For many years he served as pianist for the evangelist [[Kathryn Kuhlman]]. Dino has traveled extensively and produced well over 50 recordings on his own as well as mainstream labels. He has worked with various other evangelists. \n\nDino has hosted two television shows, the \"Dino and Debby Show\" in the 1970s with his first wife Deborah Keener and \"The Dino Show\" which formerly aired on the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]].  Dino has described his style as combining the classical and the sacred. His technique has been described as fluid and brilliant and he has been termed the \"Christian Liberace\" because of his flair, costumes, pianos and jewelry.<ref name=\"The Christian Liberace\">{{cite web|last=Kartsonakis|first=Dino|title=Dino Dubbed \"The Christian Liberace\"|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-view/Dino.html|accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref> \n\nMany of his works are religious-based or contemporary arrangements of classical works. Dino also performs in his own show in [[Branson, Missouri]].<ref name=\"Dino's Branson Shows\">{{cite web|last=Kartsonakis|first=Dino|title=Dino Performs in Branson|url=http://www.bransonshows.com/articles/DinosChristmasExtravaganzainBranson.htm|publisher=Bransonshows.com|accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref>  Among his accomplishments is production of what is known as the \"Peace Series\", a collection of CDs featuring more subdued piano arrangements against a backdrop of nature sounds. \n\nDino performed at [[Carnegie Hall]] on December 15, 2005. He has participated in an auction benefiting Music Cares, a charitable organization that helps struggling musicians and entertainers.<ref name=\"Kartsonakis Plays Carnegie Hall\">{{cite web|last=Kartsonakis|first=Dino|title=Dino Plays Carnegie Hall|url=http://www.assistnews.net/Stories/2005/s05120024.htm|publisher=assistnews.net|accessdate=13 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016044213/http://www.assistnews.net/Stories/2005/s05120024.htm|archivedate=16 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nDino received a participation [[Grammy Award]] in 1999 for his work on the soundtrack of the movie [[The Apostle]].<ref name=\"Dino wins Grammy for his participation in the movie soundtrack of The Apostle\">{{cite web|last=Kartsonakis|first=Dino|title=Dino  wins participation Grammy for the Apostle|url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/best-southern-country-bluegrass-gospel-317.html|accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1974, Dino married his first wife, Deborah Keener, and together they have a daughter, Christina (who is now a singer-songwriter and producer, and goes by the stage name Sugar Dame).<ref name=\"Christina Kartsonakis as Sugar Dame\">{{cite web|last=Kartsonakis|first=Christina|title=Christina Kartsonakis as Sugar Dame|url=http://www.antimusic.com/morley/13/ChristinaKartsonakis.shtml|publisher=antimusic.com|accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref> After touring as Dino & Debby, the two divorced in 1981.

They are a major supplier to the [[Neiman Marcus]] stores and caf\u00e9s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bransoncake.com/|title=Dino's 24 Karrot Cake & Coffee Co. {{!}} Home of the 24Karrot Carrot Cake, Gourmet Cake, Coffees and Espresso|website=Dino's 24 Karrot Cake & Coffee Co. {{!}} Home of the 24Karrot Carrot Cake, Gourmet Cake, Coffees and Espresso|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011 Dino and his wife Cheryl lost their home during a flood in the Branson, Missouri area. Dino lost all of his possessions such as his grand show pianos as well as all of his costumes, industry memorabilia and awards.

In 1998, singer Scott Wenzel took a two-year break to do [[missionary|mission]] work in Paraguay, [[South America]]. During this time, Whitecross went on hiatus before re-emerging at Cornerstone Festival in 2000 when Carroll and Wenzel re-formed the band with Carroll, Wenzel, Michael Feighan and newcomer [[Benny Ramos]] providing bass, keyboards and vocals. Finally having achieved a long-sought lineup stability, the band started performing on a regular basis.\n\nIn 2005, the band went back into the studio to record ''Nineteen Eighty Seven'', which featured re-recordings of nine of the ten songs from the band's self-titled debut album (''You're Mine'' being the exclusion), as well as a re-recording of the song ''Love on the Line'' (previously unavailable on CD) and a new guitar instrumental by Rex Carroll.\n\nOn April 5, 2008, they played at the [[Legends of Rock]] festival in [[Ennepetal]], Germany. Beginning in July 2008, they played the first of several short tours in Guatemala featuring shows in [[Guatemala City]], [[Panajachel]], [[Huehuetenango]] and other cities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nIn 2017, Carroll and Feighan joined with David Bach and [[Jamie Rowe]] of [[Guardian (band)|Guardian]] to record ''Revival'', a new compilation of Whitecross and Guardian tracks and went on a short tour to promote the project. <ref>{{cite web|title=Guardian + Whitecross - About |url= https://guardianwhitecross.com/about |website= guardianwhitecross.com |accessdate=January 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Albums==\n\n===With Rex Carroll===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=40% align=\"left\"|Album\n!width=20% align=\"left\"|Year\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''[[Whitecross (album)|Whitecross]]''\n|align=\"center\"|1987\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''[[Love on the Line (EP)]]''\n|align=\"center\"|1988\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''[[Hammer & Nail]]''\n|align=\"center\"|1988\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''[[Triumphant Return]]''\n|align=\"center\"|1989\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''[[In the Kingdom]]''\n|align=\"center\"|1991\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''[[High Gear (Whitecross album)|High Gear]]''\n|align=\"center\"|1992\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''[[Nineteen Eighty Seven]]''\n|align=\"center\"|2005\n|}\n\n===Without Rex Carroll===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=40% align=\"left\"|Album\n!width=20% align=\"left\"|Year\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''[[Unveiled (Whitecross album)|Unveiled]]''\n|align=\"center\"|1994\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''[[Equilibrium (Whitecross album)|Equilibrium]]''\n|align=\"center\"|1995\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''[[Flytrap (Whitecross album)|Flytrap]]''\n|align=\"center\"|1996\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''Unveiled'' (re-issue)\n|align=\"center\"|2005\n|}\n\n===Compilations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=40% align=\"left\"|Album\n!width=20% align=\"left\"|Year\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''At Their Best''\n|align=\"center\"|1991\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''To the Limit''\n|align=\"center\"|1993\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''By Demand''\n|align=\"center\"|1995\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''One More Encore''\n|align=\"center\"|1998\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''Mega 3 Collection''\n|align=\"center\"|2005\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''The Very Best of Whitecross''\n|align=\"center\"|2006\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|''Their Classic Hits''\n|align=\"center\"|2009\n|}\n\n==Videos==\n*[[The Reign Goes On]] - 45 minute [[VHS]], 1992 [[Star Song Communications]] (extremely rare)\n\n==Members of Whitecross==\n\n; Current\n* Scott Wenzel \u2013 lead vocals (1985\u2013present)\n* [[Rex Carroll]] \u2013 guitar, vocals (1985\u20131993, 2000\u2013present)\n* Michael Feighan \u2013 drums, vocals (1991\u20131995, 2000\u2013present)\n* [[Benny Ramos]] \u2013 bass guitar, vocals (2000\u2013present)\n\n; Former\n;Guitars\n*Barry Graul ([[MercyMe]]) (1994\u20131995)\n*Quinton Gibson (1996)\n\n; Drums\n*Mark Hedl (1987\u20131988)\n*Mike Elliott (1989)\n*Troy Stone (1996)\n\n; bass guitar\n*Jon Sproule (1987\u20131988)\n*Rick Armstrong (1989)\n*Butch Dillon (1991)\n*Scott Harper (1992\u20131993)\n*[[Tracy Ferrie]] (1994\u20131995)\n*Brent Denny (1996)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| width=\"10%\" |\n! width=\"10%\" |''[[Whitecross (album)|Whitecross]]''\n! width=\"10%\" |''[[Hammer & Nail]]''\n! width=\"10%\" |''[[Triumphant Return]]''\n! width=\"10%\" |''[[In the Kingdom]]''\n! width=\"10%\" |''[[High Gear (Whitecross album)|High Gear]]''\n! width=\"10%\" |''[[Unveiled (Whitecross album)|Unveiled]]''\n! width=\"10%\" |''[[Equilibrium (Whitecross album)|Equilibrium]]''\n! width=\"10%\" |''[[Flytrap (Whitecross album)|Flytrap]]''\n! width=\"10%\" |''[[Nineteen Eighty Seven]]''\n|-\n!

Its latest album is [[Nineteen Eighty Seven]], released in 2005.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Whitecross-EoR2013-01.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Scott Wenzel on stage in 2013]]\nWhitecross formed in 1985 in [[Waukegan, Illinois]], releasing their first recording in 1987. Their early albums, which often invite comparisons to [[Ratt]], are laced with fast, technical [[electric guitar|guitar]] work. In 1994, Rex Carroll split with lead vocalist Scott Wenzel. Wenzel retained the use of the name \"Whitecross\" while Carroll went on to form King James with Jimi Bennett (see below). At this point the band's sound underwent a drastic change.\n\nWhitecross has won three [[Dove Award]]s with ''Triumphant Return'' (in 1990) and ''In the Kingdom'' (in 1992) winning \"Metal Album of the Year\"<ref name=\"DOVE_HM\">{{cite web |url=http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?cid=31 |title=Dove Award Recipients for Hard Music Album |accessdate=March 12, 2007 |publisher=[[Gospel Music Association]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020022738/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?cid=31 |archivedate=October 20, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and ''Come unto the Light'' from the ''Unveiled'' album winning \"Hard Music Recorded Song of the Year\" at the [[25th GMA Dove Awards]] in 1994.<ref name=\"DOVE_95\">{{cite web |url=http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1995 |title=Dove Award Recipients for 1995 |accessdate=March 12, 2007 |publisher=[[Gospel Music Association]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311040429/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1995 |archivedate=March 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1994 prior to work starting on the ''Unveiled'' album, guitarist Rex Carroll left to form the band [[King James (band)|King James]] and pursue other musical ventures. In 1998, singer Scott Wenzel took a two-year break to do [[missionary|mission]] work in Paraguay, [[South America]].

The station is owned by [[Salem Media Group]] and it airs a [[Christian contemporary]] [[radio format]].  It is branded as ''The Fish 104.7'' and describes itself as \"Safe For The Whole Family.\"  Between [[Thanksgiving (US)|Thanksgiving]] and the weekend after [[Christmas]], the station plays all [[Christmas music]], both religious and secular.\n\nWFSH-FM has its offices and [[radio studio]]s in the [[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead]] district of Atlanta.  The [[transmitter]] is on the tallest [[list of Atlanta broadcast stations by location|radio tower]] in Georgia, located off Piney Grove Road in [[Loganville, Georgia|Loganville]], about {{convert|30|mi|km|-1}} east of Atlanta.<ref>[https://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/finder?call=wfsh&x=0&y=0&sr=Y&s=C Radio-Locator.com/WFSH-FM]</ref>  The [[height above average terrain]] (HAAT) of this tower allows the station to better penetrate [[office building]]s in Atlanta.  The [[effective radiated power]] (ERP) is 24,000 [[watt]]s.<ref>[https://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=wfsh&arn=&state=&city=&freq=0.0&fre2=107.9&serv=&vac=&facid=&asrn=&class=&list=0&ThisTab=Results+to+This+Page%2FTab&dist=&dlat2=&mlat2=&slat2=&NS=N&dlon2=&mlon2=&slon2=&EW=W&size=9 FCC.gov/WFSH-FM]</ref>\n\n==Programming==\nWFSH-FM is one of three Christian Contemporary stations serving Metro Atlanta, along with 106.7 [[WAKL (FM)|WAKL]] and 93.3 [[WVFJ]].  Unlike its competitors, which are run by [[non-profit organization]]s and seek donations, WFSH-FM is a [[commercial radio]] station.  Salem uses \"The Fish\" as the moniker for several of its Christian Contemporary stations, including [[KFSH-FM|KFSH]] [[Los Angeles]], [[WFHM-FM]] [[Cleveland]] and [[WFFH]] [[Nashville]]. The fish, called the [[Ichthys]], was used as a symbol of the early [[Christian Church]].\n\n==History==\n===WDOL-FM and WJSR===\nIn January 1964, the station [[sign-on|signed on]] as '''WDOL-FM'''.<REF>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1965/B-All-Radio-1965-YB-All.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1965 page B-39]</REF>  It was the FM counterpart of [[AM 1470]] WDOL (now [[WXAG]]).  Both stations were owned by James S. Rivers, who served as the president.  Because WDOL was a [[daytimer]],  WDOL-FM [[simulcast]]ed the AM station's [[country music]] format during the day and continued on its own after sunset when WDOL had to be off the air.  WDOL-FM was powered at only 3,500 watts, limiting its signal to Athens and adjacent communities, not hitting the larger Atlanta [[media market|radio market]]..\n\nIn the 1970s, the station got a boost to 50,000 watts.  As more people acquired FM radios, WDOL-FM switched its [[call sign]] to '''WJSR''' and aired a [[progressive rock]] format, while co-owned WDOL continued as a country outlet.\n\n===Top 40 WAGQ===\nIn 1976, WJSR was acquired by Broadcast Properties, Inc.<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1980/1980-BC-YB.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1980 page C-52]</ref>  The station flipped to [[contemporary hit radio|Top 40]] hits, as '''WAGQ''', and became an [[network affiliate|affiliate]] of the [[ABC News Radio|ABC Contemporary Network]]. Even though the station had a 50,000 watt signal on a 230 foot [[Radio masts and towers|tower]], it was still limited to serving Athens and its surrounding towns.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, WAGQ asked the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) for a [[construction permit]] to double its power to 100,000 watts and greatly increase its [[height above average terrain|antenna height]] to over 1,000 feet, using to a tower closer to Atlanta.  This would make WAGQ a \"move-in station,\" serving the more lucrative Atlanta market.  The FCC granted the request, making WAGQ a [[list of broadcast station classes|Class C1]] station.\n\n===Urban AC WALR===\nIn 1989, the station was sold to Ring Radio, Inc., which also owned [[WCNN]].<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1991/B-Radio-All-1991-B&W-3.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1991 page B-79]</ref>  \"Music Radio 104.7\" debuted, with a [[hot adult contemporary]] format.  The station switched its call sign to '''WALR''' in July 1990.\n\nOn October 8, 1990, [[WALR-FM]] was relaunched with an [[urban adult contemporary]] format as \"Love 104.7\", then later on as \"Kiss 104.7\".<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1990/RR-1990-10-19.pdf]</ref>  This was the second incarnation of the \"Kiss\" branding, after it was previously used in the mid-1980s on WEKS (the former call sign on 104.1).  Under this format, it was the first permanent competitor to attempt to chip away at the [[African-American]] audience enjoyed by heritage urban station [[WVEE (FM)|WVEE]].\n\n===Switching Frequencies===\nOn August 30, 2000, WALR and its adult urban format moved to 104.1, now known as \"Kiss 104.1,\" to make room for [[Christian Contemporary]] \"104.7 the Fish.\"  The swap was part of an asset exchange between [[Cox Media Group]] and [[Salem Communications]].\n\nWFSH-FM hosts \"Celebrate Freedom Atlanta\" each year on [[Labor Day (US)|Labor Day]] weekend.

The station is owned by [[Salem Media Group]] and it airs a [[Christian contemporary]] [[radio format]].  It is branded as ''The Fish 104.7'' and describes itself as \"Safe For The Whole Family.\"  Between [[Thanksgiving (US)|Thanksgiving]] and the weekend after [[Christmas]], the station plays all [[Christmas music]], both religious and secular.\n\nWFSH-FM has its offices and [[radio studio]]s in the [[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead]] district of Atlanta.  The [[transmitter]] is on the tallest [[list of Atlanta broadcast stations by location|radio tower]] in Georgia, located off Piney Grove Road in [[Loganville, Georgia|Loganville]], about {{convert|30|mi|km|-1}} east of Atlanta.<ref>[https://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/finder?call=wfsh&x=0&y=0&sr=Y&s=C Radio-Locator.com/WFSH-FM]</ref>  The [[height above average terrain]] (HAAT) of this tower allows the station to better penetrate [[office building]]s in Atlanta.

Unlike its competitors, which are run by [[non-profit organization]]s and seek donations, WFSH-FM is a [[commercial radio]] station.  Salem uses \"The Fish\" as the moniker for several of its Christian Contemporary stations, including [[KFSH-FM|KFSH]] [[Los Angeles]], [[WFHM-FM]] [[Cleveland]] and [[WFFH]] [[Nashville]]. The fish, called the [[Ichthys]], was used as a symbol of the early [[Christian Church]].\n\n==History==\n===WDOL-FM and WJSR===\nIn January 1964, the station [[sign-on|signed on]] as '''WDOL-FM'''.<REF>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1965/B-All-Radio-1965-YB-All.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1965 page B-39]</REF>  It was the FM counterpart of [[AM 1470]] WDOL (now [[WXAG]]).  Both stations were owned by James S. Rivers, who served as the president.  Because WDOL was a [[daytimer]],  WDOL-FM [[simulcast]]ed the AM station's [[country music]] format during the day and continued on its own after sunset when WDOL had to be off the air.  WDOL-FM was powered at only 3,500 watts, limiting its signal to Athens and adjacent communities, not hitting the larger Atlanta [[media market|radio market]]..\n\nIn the 1970s, the station got a boost to 50,000 watts.  As more people acquired FM radios, WDOL-FM switched its [[call sign]] to '''WJSR''' and aired a [[progressive rock]] format, while co-owned WDOL continued as a country outlet.\n\n===Top 40 WAGQ===\nIn 1976, WJSR was acquired by Broadcast Properties, Inc.<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1980/1980-BC-YB.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1980 page C-52]</ref>  The station flipped to [[contemporary hit radio|Top 40]] hits, as '''WAGQ''', and became an [[network affiliate|affiliate]] of the [[ABC News Radio|ABC Contemporary Network]]. Even though the station had a 50,000 watt signal on a 230 foot [[Radio masts and towers|tower]], it was still limited to serving Athens and its surrounding towns.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, WAGQ asked the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) for a [[construction permit]] to double its power to 100,000 watts and greatly increase its [[height above average terrain|antenna height]] to over 1,000 feet, using to a tower closer to Atlanta.  This would make WAGQ a \"move-in station,\" serving the more lucrative Atlanta market.  The FCC granted the request, making WAGQ a [[list of broadcast station classes|Class C1]] station.\n\n===Urban AC WALR===\nIn 1989, the station was sold to Ring Radio, Inc., which also owned [[WCNN]].<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1991/B-Radio-All-1991-B&W-3.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1991 page B-79]</ref>  \"Music Radio 104.7\" debuted, with a [[hot adult contemporary]] format.  The station switched its call sign to '''WALR''' in July 1990.\n\nOn October 8, 1990, [[WALR-FM]] was relaunched with an [[urban adult contemporary]] format as \"Love 104.7\", then later on as \"Kiss 104.7\".<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1990/RR-1990-10-19.pdf]</ref>  This was the second incarnation of the \"Kiss\" branding, after it was previously used in the mid-1980s on WEKS (the former call sign on 104.1).  Under this format, it was the first permanent competitor to attempt to chip away at the [[African-American]] audience enjoyed by heritage urban station [[WVEE (FM)|WVEE]].\n\n===Switching Frequencies===\nOn August 30, 2000, WALR and its adult urban format moved to 104.1, now known as \"Kiss 104.1,\" to make room for [[Christian Contemporary]] \"104.7 the Fish.\"  The swap was part of an asset exchange between [[Cox Media Group]] and [[Salem Communications]].\n\nWFSH-FM hosts \"Celebrate Freedom Atlanta\" each year on [[Labor Day (US)|Labor Day]] weekend.

In a 1961 study, [[Wilbur Zelinsky]] delineated the region as the area in which Protestant denominations, especially Southern Baptist, Methodist, and evangelical, are the predominant religious affiliation. The region thus defined included most of the Southern United States, including most of [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]], and in the states south of the [[Ohio River]], and extending east to include central West Virginia and Virginia, from the [[Shenandoah Valley]] southward into [[Southside Virginia]] and [[North Carolina]]. In addition, the Bible Belt covers most of [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]] and southern parts of [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], and [[Ohio]]. On the other hand, areas in the South which are ''not'' considered part of the Bible Belt include heavily Catholic Southern Louisiana, central and southern Florida, which have been settled mainly by immigrants and Americans from elsewhere in the country, and overwhelmingly Hispanic South Texas. A 1978 study by Charles Heatwole identified the Bible Belt as the region dominated by 24 fundamentalist Protestant denominations, corresponding to essentially the same area mapped by Zelinsky.<ref>Barry Vann (2008), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_cx6NMWOqKQC&pg=PA138&lpg=PA138&dq=bible+belt+charles+heatwole&source=bl&ots=s_3pBjUyyC&sig=58XbseF5_V9de4OW2ZOX34mqwTw&hl=en&ei=0Z8zS-zxDtWztgeb4Jj9CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=13&ved=0CD4Q6AEwDA#v=onepage&q=bible%20belt%20charles%20heatwole&f=false In search of Ulster-Scots land: the birth and geotheological imagings of a transatlantic people, 1603-1703]'', Univ of South Carolina Press, {{ISBN|1-57003-708-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57003-708-5}}.

The region thus defined included most of the Southern United States, including most of [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]], and in the states south of the [[Ohio River]], and extending east to include central West Virginia and Virginia, from the [[Shenandoah Valley]] southward into [[Southside Virginia]] and [[North Carolina]]. In addition, the Bible Belt covers most of [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]] and southern parts of [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], and [[Ohio]]. On the other hand, areas in the South which are ''not'' considered part of the Bible Belt include heavily Catholic Southern Louisiana, central and southern Florida, which have been settled mainly by immigrants and Americans from elsewhere in the country, and overwhelmingly Hispanic South Texas. A 1978 study by Charles Heatwole identified the Bible Belt as the region dominated by 24 fundamentalist Protestant denominations, corresponding to essentially the same area mapped by Zelinsky.<ref>Barry Vann (2008), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_cx6NMWOqKQC&pg=PA138&lpg=PA138&dq=bible+belt+charles+heatwole&source=bl&ots=s_3pBjUyyC&sig=58XbseF5_V9de4OW2ZOX34mqwTw&hl=en&ei=0Z8zS-zxDtWztgeb4Jj9CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=13&ved=0CD4Q6AEwDA#v=onepage&q=bible%20belt%20charles%20heatwole&f=false In search of Ulster-Scots land: the birth and geotheological imagings of a transatlantic people, 1603-1703]'', Univ of South Carolina Press, {{ISBN|1-57003-708-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57003-708-5}}.

In 1707 five churches in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware were united to form the Philadelphia Baptist Association, and through the association they embarked upon vigorous missionary activity. By 1760 the Philadelphia association included churches located in the present states of Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, and West Virginia; and by 1767 further multiplication of churches had necessitated the formation of two subsidiary associations, the Warren in New England and the Ketochton in Virginia. The Philadelphia association also provided leadership in organizing the Charleston Association in the Carolinas in 1751.\"<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Baptist|title=Baptist - History, Beliefs, Denominations, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> \n\nAn influential figure was [[Shubal Stearns]]: \"Shubael Stearns, a New England Separate Baptist, migrated to Sandy Creek, North Carolina, in 1755 and initiated a revival that quickly penetrated the entire Piedmont region.

Abraham Marshall, who encouraged the later offshoots, was a Separate Baptist of the Sandy Creek school.

Davis was elected for two nonconsecutive terms from 1944 to 1948 and from 1960 to 1964 as the [[governor of Louisiana|governor]] of his native [[Louisiana]]. He ran both campaigns as a controversial advocate for impoverished and rural white Louisianians.\n\nDavis was a nationally popular [[country music]] and [[gospel singer]] from the 1930s into the 1960s, occasionally recording and performing as late as the early 1990s. He appeared as himself in a number of Hollywood movies. He was inducted into six halls of fame, including the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]], the [[Southern Gospel Music Association]] Hall of Fame, and the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]]. At the time of his death in 2000, he was the oldest living former governor as well as the last living governor to have been born in the 19th century.\n\n==Early life==\nDavis was born to a [[sharecropping]] couple, the former Sarah Elizabeth Works (1877\u20131965) and Samuel Jones Davis (1873\u20131945), in Beech Springs, southeast of [[Quitman, Louisiana|Quitman]] in [[Jackson Parish, Louisiana|Jackson Parish]], north Louisiana.

His early work was in the style of country music singer [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. Davis was also known for recording energetic and raunchy [[blues]] tunes such as \"Red Nightgown Blues\". Some of these records included slide guitar accompaniment by black bluesman [[Oscar \"Buddy\" Woods]]. During his first run for governor, opponents reprinted the lyrics of some of these songs in order to undermine Davis's campaign. In one case, anti-Davis forces played some records over an outdoor sound system, only to give up after the crowds started dancing, ignoring the double-entendre lyrics. Until the end of his life, Davis never denied or repudiated those records.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn 1999, \"[[You Are My Sunshine]]\" was honored with a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]], and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] named it one of the [[Songs of the Century]]. \"You Are My Sunshine\" was ranked in 2003 as No. 73 on ''CMT's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nUntil his death, Davis insisted that he wrote the song.

After being elected in 1944, he became known as the \"singing governor.\" While governor, he had a No. 1 hit single in 1945 with \"[[There's a New Moon Over My Shoulder]]\".

In a later study of this election, three Louisiana State University [[political science|political scientist]]s described him by the following:\n\n<blockquote>Davis has all the external attributes of a \"man of the people\", but his serious political connections seem to be with the [parish-seat] elite and its allies, particularly the major industrial combinations of the state. He is in many respects a toned-down version of the old-style southern politician who could spellbound the mass of voters into supporting him regardless of the effects of his programs on their welfare. ... Davis creates the perfect image of a man to be trusted and one whose intense calm is calculated to bring rational balance into the political life of the state.<ref>William C. Havard, Rudolf Heberle, and [[Perry H. Howard]], ''The Louisiana Elections of 1960'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University]] Studies, 1963, pg. 40</ref></blockquote>\n\nDavis was running at a time when African Americans in the civil rights movement were seeking social justice and restoration of their constitutional rights. In 1954 the US Supreme Court had ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional and urged states to integrate their facilities. With a pledge to fight for continued [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in public education, Davis won the Democratic [[gubernatorial]] nomination over a crowded field.\n\nIt included fellow segregationist State Senator [[William M. Rainach]] of [[Claiborne Parish, Louisiana|Claiborne Parish]], former Lieutenant Governor [[Bill Dodd]] of [[Baton Rouge]], former Governor [[James A. Noe]] of [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], and [[mayor of New Orleans|New Orleans Mayor]] [[deLesseps Story Morrison]]. [[Addison Roswell Thompson]], the operator of a New Orleans [[taxicab]] stand and a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], also filed candidacy papers.\n\nDavis ran second in the primary to [[deLesseps Story Morrison|\"Chep\" Morrison]], considered an anti-Long liberal by Louisiana standards. He defeated Morrison in the party runoff held on January 9, 1960. As African Americans (who had supported the Republican Party after the Civil War) were still largely [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] in Louisiana, the Democratic primary was the only competitive race for office in the one-party state.\n\nIn the first round of balloting, Davis polled 213,551 (25.3 percent) to Morrison's 278,956 (33.1 percent). Rainach ran third with 143,095 (17 percent). Noe finished fourth with 97,654 (11.6 percent), and Dodd followed with 85,436 (10.1 percent). Davis won the northern and central parts of the state plus Baton Rouge, while Morrison dominated the southern portion of the state, particularly the French cultural parishes. In the runoff, Davis prevailed, 487,681 (54.1 percent) to Morrison's 414,110 (45.5 percent). It was estimated that Davis drew virtually all the Rainach support from the first primary.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nEarl Long endorsed Davis in the runoff in part because he had a longstanding personal dislike of Morrison. Long's gubernatorial running-mate, James A. Noe, who finished fourth in the primary, stood with Morrison,<ref>\"Noe Gives Support to Morrison\", ''The Shreveport Times'', December 10, 1959, pg. 1</ref> as did the fifth-place gubernatorial candidate and former Long lieutenant governor, Bill Dodd.<ref>\"Dodd Announces Endorsement for Morrison Ticket\", ''The Shreveport Times'', December 8, 1959, pg. 1</ref>\n\nRainach and his unsuccessful candidate for state comptroller, later U.S. Representative [[Joe D. Waggonner]], both endorsed Davis on the premise that Davis would be a stronger segregationist than Morrison.<ref>''Minden Herald'', December 31, 1959.</ref> Davis had avoided segregationist rhetoric in the first primary race in 1959. According to Morrison, the singer had sought support from the [[NAACP]] in New Orleans and [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]].<ref>\"Morrison Says Davis Sought NAACP Support\", ''The Shreveport Times'', December 16, 1959, pg. 10A.</ref>\n\nIn the runoff with Morrison, Davis tried to identify as a more determined and dedicated segregationist than his rival. Morrison questioned Davis's change in campaign strategy and also appealed to segregationists. Morrison charged that Davis had \"operated an integrated [[honky-tonk]] in [[California]]\", when Davis was out of state with his singing career. Morrison also said that Davis had allowed the illegal operation of nine thousand [[slot machine]]s when Davis was governor during the 1940s.<ref>\"Beaten Candidates Give Endorsements\", ''The Shreveport Times'', December 11, 1959, pg. 5-A.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Earl Long had run unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in the first primary in 1959. There was a runoff between Morrison's choice for the job, Alexandria Mayor [[W. George Bowdon Jr.]], and Davis's selection, former state House Speaker [[Taddy Aycock|Clarence C. \"Taddy\" Aycock]] of [[Franklin, Louisiana|Franklin]], [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]]. Aycock defeated Bowdon by a margin similar to the plurality of Davis over Morrison. The defeat was Long's second for lieutenant governor. He had lost in the 1944 primary to [[J. Emile Verret]] of [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]], who served in the second-ranking position in the first Davis administration.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nDavis effectively used the slogan \"He's One of Us\" in the gubernatorial race. Number 6 on the ballot, he assembled an intraparty [[Ticket (politics)|ticket]] for other statewide constitutional officers, including Aycock for lieutenant governor, [[Roy R. Theriot]] of [[Abbeville, Louisiana|Abbeville]] for comptroller, [[Douglas Fowler]] of [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]] for custodian of voting machines, [[Jack P.F. Gremillion]] for [[Attorney General of Louisiana|attorney general]], [[Dave L. Pearce]], originally from [[West Carroll Parish, Louisiana|West Carroll Parish]], for agriculture commissioner, [[Ellen Bryan Moore]] for register of state lands, and [[Rufus D. Hayes]] for insurance commissioner; the latter four were all based in Baton Rouge. The entire Davis ticket was elected.<ref>Davis exhibit, Delta Music Museum, [[Ferriday, Louisiana|Ferriday]], Louisiana.</ref>\n\nIn their study ''The Louisiana Election of 1960'', William C. Havard, Rudolf Heberle, and [[Perry H. Howard]] demonstrated that Davis built his second-primary victory by narrowly edging Morrison in the eastern and western extremities of south Louisiana. Davis secured the backing of [[organized labor]] and made inroads among the white, urban working class, which would have been essential to a Morrison victory. In the seven urban industrial parishes, which then comprised some 46.5 percent of the total turnout, Davis topped Morrison by 7,368 votes (50.8 percent) of the 419,537 applicable subtotal. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nMorrison polled 60 percent in his own Orleans Parish and 54.6 percent in adjacent [[suburban]] [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]], but in the industrial strip and in more Protestant areas, Morrison slipped. The second primary attracted 57,744 more votes than the initial stage of balloting, and analysts found that the lion's share of additional ballots were filed by segregationists who backed Davis.<ref>Havard, Heberle, and Havard, ''The Louisiana Election of 1960'', pp. 50\u201352.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nIn the general election held on April 19, 1960, Davis defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Francis Grevemberg]], a [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] native, by a margin of nearly 82\u201317 percent. Grevemberg had been head of the state police under Democratic Governor [[Robert F. Kennon]] and had gained a reputation for fighting [[organized crime]]. He called for a true two-party system for Louisiana. As the Democratic nominee in the nearly one-party state, Davis faced no serious political threat and did little campaigning against Grevemberg.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIt has been reported that had General [[Curtis LeMay]] turned down [[George C. Wallace]]'s offer to be his candidate for vice president in 1968 on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket, that Wallace was ready to announce Davis as his selection for vice president. Other sources say Wallace's second choice was the former [[governor of Arkansas]], [[Orval Faubus]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902367,00.html|title=The Campaign: George's General|date=October 11, 1968|website=Content.time.com|accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Davis and Dodd====\nIn the 1959 campaign, Bill Dodd had attacked Davis ferociously: it was part of Dodd's strategy to get Davis to withdraw from the primary. \"Nothing personal in his [Dodd's] heart, just a cold-blooded plan to wind up in a second primary against Morrison, who he figured could not win against anyone [else] in a runoff,\" said Davis in the introduction to Dodd's memoirs, ''Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in Louisiana Politics''.\n\nDodd endorsed Morrison in the runoff, but he had a long-term reason for this decision. Dodd planned to run for school superintendent in the 1963 primary, and he wanted to have at least the neutrality of Morrison four years thereafter.\n\nDodd and Davis later became close friends. In Davis' words:\n\n<blockquote>Bill and I have many things in common. We share the same type of religion and boyhood background; we got our start as schoolteachers and figured prominently in public education; we both served in public life at or near the top. And I like to feel that we share a common appreciation and respect for people, all people. One of the greatest rewards in politics is meeting people. And one of the greatest and most unusual men I've ever met is Bill Dodd.</blockquote>\n\n===Second term (1960\u20131964)===\nDavis' appointees in the second term included outgoing State Representative [[Claude Kirkpatrick]] of [[Jennings, Louisiana|Jennings]], who was named to succeed [[Lorris M. Wimberly]] as the Director of Public Works. In that capacity, Kirkpatrick took the steps for a joint agreement with [[State of Texas|Texas]] to establish the popular [[Toledo Bend Reservoir]], a haven for [[boating]] and fishing. Mrs. Kirkpatrick, the former [[Edith Killgore Kirkpatrick|Edith Killgore]], a native of Claiborne Parish, headed Davis' women's campaign division for southwestern Louisiana. He appointed Alexandria businessman Morgan W. Walker, Sr., to the State Mineral Board. Walker founded a company which later became part of [[Continental Trailways]] [[Bus]] lines. Davis named as state highway director [[Ray Burgess]] of Baton Rouge, who considered running for governor in the 1963 primary.\n\nAs part of his support of segregation, Davis initiated passage of state legislation to create the [[Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission]], which operated from 1960 to 1967. It \"espoused states rights, anti-communist and segregationist ideas, with a particular focus on maintaining the status quo in race relations. It was closely allied with the Louisiana Joint Legislative Committee on Un-American Activities.\"<ref name=\"amistad\">[http://amistadresearchcenter.tulane.edu/archon/?p=creators/creator&id=1129 \"Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission\"], Amistad Research Center, Tulane University; Sources: Adam Fairclough.

Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1995.</ref> It was modeled after Mississippi's commission, established in 1956 to resist integration. Davis tapped [[Frank Voelker Jr.]], City Attorney of [[Lake Providence, Louisiana|Lake Providence]], to chair the newly established Commission. It was given unusual {{clarify|date=January 2018}} powers to investigate state citizens, and used its authority to exert economic pressure to suppress civil rights activists. Voelker left the commission in 1963 to run for governor but placed poorly in the primary; he withdrew and supported other candidates.<ref>Havard, Heberle, and Howard, ''The Louisiana Election of 1960'', pg. 99<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>\n\nIn his second term, Davis chose veteran Representative [[J. Thomas Jewell]] of [[New Roads, Louisiana|New Roads]] in [[Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana|Pointe Coupee Parish]] as [[Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives|House Speaker]] to succeed [[Bob Angelle]]. Davis secured passage of a $60&nbsp;million public improvements [[bond issue]] through the State Board and Building Commission, an organization controlled by the governor. He gained legislative support from many formerly pro-Long lawmakers and cemented his hold on the traditional anti-Long bloc. He avoided defeat on any legislation that he strongly supported and was able to defeat nearly all bills with which he did not concur.\n\nHe offered tacit support to Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], national Democrats, to secure the state's hold of pending offshore oil revenues. In the 1963 legislative fiscal session, he defeated efforts to procure an unpledged presidential elector slate for the 1964 general election, by which time he had been succeeded by [[John J. McKeithen]].<ref>Havard, Heberle, and Howard, ''The Louisiana Elections of 1960'', pp. 90\u201392.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>\n\n===Fourth place in 1971===\n{{Main|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1971-72}}\nIn 1971, Davis entered another crowded Democratic [[gubernatorial]] primary field with new political prospects, but he finished in fourth place with 138,756 ballots (11.8 percent).\n\nIn a runoff election held in December 1971, U.S. Representative [[Edwin Washington Edwards]] of [[Crowley, Louisiana|Crowley]], [[Acadia Parish, Louisiana|Acadia Parish]], defeated then state Senator [[Bennett Johnston|J. Bennett Johnston Jr.]], of Shreveport for the party nomination. That vote was close: Edwards, 584,262 (50.2 percent) to Johnston's 579,774 (49.8 percent). Edwards beat Republican [[David C. Treen]] in the state general election held on February 1, 1972. By that time, Davis' days as a politician were clearly behind him.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nToward the end of his life, longtime Democrat Davis endorsed at least two Republican candidates after the state's voters had gone through a political realignment. By the late 20th century, white conservatives in the state largely supported the Republican Party. In 1996 Davis endorsed Republican state representative [[Woody Jenkins]] of Baton Rouge for the U.S. Senate against Democrat [[Mary Landrieu]] of New Orleans, and Governor [[Murphy J. Foster, Jr.|Murphy J. \"Mike\" Foster, Jr.]] seeking re-election in 1999. His opponent was African-American Democratic Congressman [[Bill Jefferson]] of New Orleans.<ref>Susie Labry, 1995<!-- page(s)?? --></ref>\n\n===Political legacy===\nDavis established a State Retirement System and funding of more than $100&nbsp;million in public improvements, while leaving the state with a $38&nbsp;million surplus after his first term.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.state.la.us/67.htm|title=Louisiana Secretary of State<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=July 17, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812153046/http://www.sec.state.la.us/67.htm|archivedate=August 12, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring his second term, Davis built the [[Sunshine Bridge]], the new [[Louisiana Governor's Mansion]], and [[Toledo Bend Reservoir]], all criticized at the time, but later recognized as beneficial to the state.

Two years after her death in 1967, Davis married Anna Gordon, born Effie Juanita Carter (February 15, 1917 &ndash; March 5, 2004). A founding member of the gospel quartet ''The Chuck Wagon Gang'' along with her father and two of her brothers, she had been given the stage name \"Anna\" during the mid-1930s.  Davis was a longtime fan of the group, who were gospel music pioneers with more than 36 million records sold in forty years of affiliation with [[Columbia Records]].  \n\nOut of office, Davis resided primarily in Baton Rouge but made numerous singing appearances, particularly in churches throughout the United States.\n[[Image:Jimmie Davis grave marker IMG 5808.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Davis grave located in small cemetery behind the tabernacle]]\n\nDavis died on November 5, 2000.

Davis was elected for two nonconsecutive terms from 1944 to 1948 and from 1960 to 1964 as the [[governor of Louisiana|governor]] of his native [[Louisiana]]. He ran both campaigns as a controversial advocate for impoverished and rural white Louisianians.\n\nDavis was a nationally popular [[country music]] and [[gospel singer]] from the 1930s into the 1960s, occasionally recording and performing as late as the early 1990s. He appeared as himself in a number of Hollywood movies. He was inducted into six halls of fame, including the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]], the [[Southern Gospel Music Association]] Hall of Fame, and the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]]. At the time of his death in 2000, he was the oldest living former governor as well as the last living governor to have been born in the 19th century.\n\n==Early life==\nDavis was born to a [[sharecropping]] couple, the former Sarah Elizabeth Works (1877\u20131965) and Samuel Jones Davis (1873\u20131945), in Beech Springs, southeast of [[Quitman, Louisiana|Quitman]] in [[Jackson Parish, Louisiana|Jackson Parish]], north Louisiana.

Davis was not sure of his date of birth; according to the ''[[New York Times]]'', \"Various newspaper and magazine articles over the last 70 years said he was born in 1899, 1901, 1902 or 1903.

Dodd]], who was also the pastor of the large First Baptist Church of Shreveport and a pioneer radio preacher, invited Davis to join the faculty.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Musical career==\nDavis became a commercially successful singer of rural music before he entered politics. His early work was in the style of country music singer [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. Davis was also known for recording energetic and raunchy [[blues]] tunes such as \"Red Nightgown Blues\". Some of these records included slide guitar accompaniment by black bluesman [[Oscar \"Buddy\" Woods]]. During his first run for governor, opponents reprinted the lyrics of some of these songs in order to undermine Davis's campaign. In one case, anti-Davis forces played some records over an outdoor sound system, only to give up after the crowds started dancing, ignoring the double-entendre lyrics. Until the end of his life, Davis never denied or repudiated those records.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn 1999, \"[[You Are My Sunshine]]\" was honored with a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]], and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] named it one of the [[Songs of the Century]]. \"You Are My Sunshine\" was ranked in 2003 as No. 73 on ''CMT's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nUntil his death, Davis insisted that he wrote the song. It will be associated with him. [[Virginia Shehee]], a Shreveport [[business]]woman, [[philanthropist]], and [[Louisiana State Senate|state senator]], introduced legislation to designate \"You Are My Sunshine\" as the official state song.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shreveporttimes/obituary.aspx?n=virginia-ruth-kilpatrick-shehee&pid=175240971&fhid=10218|title=Virginia Ruth Kilpatrick Shehee|newspaper=[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}</ref> The song was reportedly written for Elizabeth Selby, a resident of Urbana, IL and housemother of Wescoga, Wesley Co-Op for Gals at the time the song was written.\n\nDavis often performed during his campaign stops when running for governor of Louisiana. After being elected in 1944, he became known as the \"singing governor.\" While governor, he had a No. 1 hit single in 1945 with \"[[There's a New Moon Over My Shoulder]]\". Davis recorded for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]], and [[Decca Records]] for decades and released more than 40 albums.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nA long-time [[Southern Baptist]], Davis recorded a number of [[Southern gospel]] albums. In 1967 he served as president of the [[Gospel Music Association]]. He was a close friend of the [[North Dakota]]-born band leader [[Lawrence Welk]], who frequently reminded viewers of his television program of his association with Davis.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nA number of his songs were used as part of motion picture soundtracks. Davis appeared in half a dozen films, including one starring [[Ozzie and Harriet]], who had a TV series under their names. Members of Davis's last band included [[Allen \"Puddler\" Harris]] of [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]].

At the time, Shreveport had the [[city commission]] form of government. After four years in Shreveport City Hall, Davis was elected in 1942 to the [[Louisiana Public Service Commission]]. The rate-making body meets in the capital, Baton Rouge. He was elected during his term as governor and left after two years.\n\n===First term as governor (1944\u20131948)===\n{{See also|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1944}}\nDavis was elected governor as a Democrat in 1944. Among those eliminated in the primary were [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Ernest S.

Morrison]] of [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] in [[Tangipahoa Parish]], and [[Sam Caldwell]], the [[List of mayors of Shreveport, Louisiana|mayor of Shreveport]]. Davis and Caldwell had served together earlier in Shreveport municipal government.\n\nIn the [[runoff election|runoff]], Davis defeated [[Lewis L. Morgan]], an elderly attorney and former [[U.S. representative]] from [[Covington, Louisiana|Covington]], the seat of [[St. Tammany Parish]], who had been backed by former Governor [[Earl Kemp Long]] and [[mayor of New Orleans|New Orleans Mayor]] [[Robert Maestri]]. In the runoff, Davis received 251,228 (53.6 percent) to Morgan's 217,915 (46.4 percent).\n\nDavis recruited [[Chris Faser, Jr.]], a young staff member of the Public Service Commission, to manage his gubernatorial race and act as his chief of staff. Faser became the \"go-to\" guy to obtain access to the governor.<ref>{{cite news|title=Christian Faser, Jr. (1917-2004)|work=[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]|date=January 18, 2004}}</ref>\n\nDavis pleased white liberals with his appointments to high positions of two of the leaders of the [[impeachment]] effort against [[Huey Long|Huey Pierce Long Jr.]] He named [[Cecil Morgan]] of Shreveport to the Louisiana Civil Service Commission. Morgan was succeeded in the Louisiana House by [[Rupert Peyton]] of Shreveport, who also served as an aide to Davis. In addition, Davis retained the anti-Long [[Ralph Norman Bauer]] of [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]] as House speaker, a selection made originally in 1940 by Sam Jones.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nDavis reached out to the Longites when he commuted the prison sentence imposed on former LSU President [[James Monroe Smith]], convicted in the [[Louisiana Hayride scandals]] of the late 1930s.

In a later study of this election, three Louisiana State University [[political science|political scientist]]s described him by the following:\n\n<blockquote>Davis has all the external attributes of a \"man of the people\", but his serious political connections seem to be with the [parish-seat] elite and its allies, particularly the major industrial combinations of the state. He is in many respects a toned-down version of the old-style southern politician who could spellbound the mass of voters into supporting him regardless of the effects of his programs on their welfare. ... Davis creates the perfect image of a man to be trusted and one whose intense calm is calculated to bring rational balance into the political life of the state.<ref>William C. Havard, Rudolf Heberle, and [[Perry H. Howard]], ''The Louisiana Elections of 1960'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University]] Studies, 1963, pg. 40</ref></blockquote>\n\nDavis was running at a time when African Americans in the civil rights movement were seeking social justice and restoration of their constitutional rights. In 1954 the US Supreme Court had ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional and urged states to integrate their facilities. With a pledge to fight for continued [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in public education, Davis won the Democratic [[gubernatorial]] nomination over a crowded field.\n\nIt included fellow segregationist State Senator [[William M. Rainach]] of [[Claiborne Parish, Louisiana|Claiborne Parish]], former Lieutenant Governor [[Bill Dodd]] of [[Baton Rouge]], former Governor [[James A. Noe]] of [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], and [[mayor of New Orleans|New Orleans Mayor]] [[deLesseps Story Morrison]]. [[Addison Roswell Thompson]], the operator of a New Orleans [[taxicab]] stand and a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], also filed candidacy papers.\n\nDavis ran second in the primary to [[deLesseps Story Morrison|\"Chep\" Morrison]], considered an anti-Long liberal by Louisiana standards. He defeated Morrison in the party runoff held on January 9, 1960. As African Americans (who had supported the Republican Party after the Civil War) were still largely [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] in Louisiana, the Democratic primary was the only competitive race for office in the one-party state.\n\nIn the first round of balloting, Davis polled 213,551 (25.3 percent) to Morrison's 278,956 (33.1 percent). Rainach ran third with 143,095 (17 percent). Noe finished fourth with 97,654 (11.6 percent), and Dodd followed with 85,436 (10.1 percent). Davis won the northern and central parts of the state plus Baton Rouge, while Morrison dominated the southern portion of the state, particularly the French cultural parishes. In the runoff, Davis prevailed, 487,681 (54.1 percent) to Morrison's 414,110 (45.5 percent). It was estimated that Davis drew virtually all the Rainach support from the first primary.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nEarl Long endorsed Davis in the runoff in part because he had a longstanding personal dislike of Morrison. Long's gubernatorial running-mate, James A. Noe, who finished fourth in the primary, stood with Morrison,<ref>\"Noe Gives Support to Morrison\", ''The Shreveport Times'', December 10, 1959, pg. 1</ref> as did the fifth-place gubernatorial candidate and former Long lieutenant governor, Bill Dodd.<ref>\"Dodd Announces Endorsement for Morrison Ticket\", ''The Shreveport Times'', December 8, 1959, pg. 1</ref>\n\nRainach and his unsuccessful candidate for state comptroller, later U.S. Representative [[Joe D. Waggonner]], both endorsed Davis on the premise that Davis would be a stronger segregationist than Morrison.<ref>''Minden Herald'', December 31, 1959.</ref> Davis had avoided segregationist rhetoric in the first primary race in 1959. According to Morrison, the singer had sought support from the [[NAACP]] in New Orleans and [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]].<ref>\"Morrison Says Davis Sought NAACP Support\", ''The Shreveport Times'', December 16, 1959, pg. 10A.</ref>\n\nIn the runoff with Morrison, Davis tried to identify as a more determined and dedicated segregationist than his rival. Morrison questioned Davis's change in campaign strategy and also appealed to segregationists. Morrison charged that Davis had \"operated an integrated [[honky-tonk]] in [[California]]\", when Davis was out of state with his singing career. Morrison also said that Davis had allowed the illegal operation of nine thousand [[slot machine]]s when Davis was governor during the 1940s.<ref>\"Beaten Candidates Give Endorsements\", ''The Shreveport Times'', December 11, 1959, pg. 5-A.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Earl Long had run unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in the first primary in 1959. There was a runoff between Morrison's choice for the job, Alexandria Mayor [[W. George Bowdon Jr.]], and Davis's selection, former state House Speaker [[Taddy Aycock|Clarence C. \"Taddy\" Aycock]] of [[Franklin, Louisiana|Franklin]], [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]]. Aycock defeated Bowdon by a margin similar to the plurality of Davis over Morrison. The defeat was Long's second for lieutenant governor. He had lost in the 1944 primary to [[J. Emile Verret]] of [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]], who served in the second-ranking position in the first Davis administration.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nDavis effectively used the slogan \"He's One of Us\" in the gubernatorial race. Number 6 on the ballot, he assembled an intraparty [[Ticket (politics)|ticket]] for other statewide constitutional officers, including Aycock for lieutenant governor, [[Roy R. Theriot]] of [[Abbeville, Louisiana|Abbeville]] for comptroller, [[Douglas Fowler]] of [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]] for custodian of voting machines, [[Jack P.F. Gremillion]] for [[Attorney General of Louisiana|attorney general]], [[Dave L. Pearce]], originally from [[West Carroll Parish, Louisiana|West Carroll Parish]], for agriculture commissioner, [[Ellen Bryan Moore]] for register of state lands, and [[Rufus D. Hayes]] for insurance commissioner; the latter four were all based in Baton Rouge. The entire Davis ticket was elected.<ref>Davis exhibit, Delta Music Museum, [[Ferriday, Louisiana|Ferriday]], Louisiana.</ref>\n\nIn their study ''The Louisiana Election of 1960'', William C. Havard, Rudolf Heberle, and [[Perry H. Howard]] demonstrated that Davis built his second-primary victory by narrowly edging Morrison in the eastern and western extremities of south Louisiana. Davis secured the backing of [[organized labor]] and made inroads among the white, urban working class, which would have been essential to a Morrison victory. In the seven urban industrial parishes, which then comprised some 46.5 percent of the total turnout, Davis topped Morrison by 7,368 votes (50.8 percent) of the 419,537 applicable subtotal. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nMorrison polled 60 percent in his own Orleans Parish and 54.6 percent in adjacent [[suburban]] [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]], but in the industrial strip and in more Protestant areas, Morrison slipped. The second primary attracted 57,744 more votes than the initial stage of balloting, and analysts found that the lion's share of additional ballots were filed by segregationists who backed Davis.<ref>Havard, Heberle, and Havard, ''The Louisiana Election of 1960'', pp. 50\u201352.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nIn the general election held on April 19, 1960, Davis defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Francis Grevemberg]], a [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] native, by a margin of nearly 82\u201317 percent. Grevemberg had been head of the state police under Democratic Governor [[Robert F. Kennon]] and had gained a reputation for fighting [[organized crime]]. He called for a true two-party system for Louisiana. As the Democratic nominee in the nearly one-party state, Davis faced no serious political threat and did little campaigning against Grevemberg.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIt has been reported that had General [[Curtis LeMay]] turned down [[George C. Wallace]]'s offer to be his candidate for vice president in 1968 on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket, that Wallace was ready to announce Davis as his selection for vice president. Other sources say Wallace's second choice was the former [[governor of Arkansas]], [[Orval Faubus]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902367,00.html|title=The Campaign: George's General|date=October 11, 1968|website=Content.time.com|accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Davis and Dodd====\nIn the 1959 campaign, Bill Dodd had attacked Davis ferociously: it was part of Dodd's strategy to get Davis to withdraw from the primary. \"Nothing personal in his [Dodd's] heart, just a cold-blooded plan to wind up in a second primary against Morrison, who he figured could not win against anyone [else] in a runoff,\" said Davis in the introduction to Dodd's memoirs, ''Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in Louisiana Politics''.\n\nDodd endorsed Morrison in the runoff, but he had a long-term reason for this decision. Dodd planned to run for school superintendent in the 1963 primary, and he wanted to have at least the neutrality of Morrison four years thereafter.\n\nDodd and Davis later became close friends. In Davis' words:\n\n<blockquote>Bill and I have many things in common. We share the same type of religion and boyhood background; we got our start as schoolteachers and figured prominently in public education; we both served in public life at or near the top. And I like to feel that we share a common appreciation and respect for people, all people. One of the greatest rewards in politics is meeting people. And one of the greatest and most unusual men I've ever met is Bill Dodd.</blockquote>\n\n===Second term (1960\u20131964)===\nDavis' appointees in the second term included outgoing State Representative [[Claude Kirkpatrick]] of [[Jennings, Louisiana|Jennings]], who was named to succeed [[Lorris M. Wimberly]] as the Director of Public Works. In that capacity, Kirkpatrick took the steps for a joint agreement with [[State of Texas|Texas]] to establish the popular [[Toledo Bend Reservoir]], a haven for [[boating]] and fishing. Mrs. Kirkpatrick, the former [[Edith Killgore Kirkpatrick|Edith Killgore]], a native of Claiborne Parish, headed Davis' women's campaign division for southwestern Louisiana. He appointed Alexandria businessman Morgan W. Walker, Sr., to the State Mineral Board. Walker founded a company which later became part of [[Continental Trailways]] [[Bus]] lines. Davis named as state highway director [[Ray Burgess]] of Baton Rouge, who considered running for governor in the 1963 primary.\n\nAs part of his support of segregation, Davis initiated passage of state legislation to create the [[Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission]], which operated from 1960 to 1967. It \"espoused states rights, anti-communist and segregationist ideas, with a particular focus on maintaining the status quo in race relations. It was closely allied with the Louisiana Joint Legislative Committee on Un-American Activities.\"<ref name=\"amistad\">[http://amistadresearchcenter.tulane.edu/archon/?p=creators/creator&id=1129 \"Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission\"], Amistad Research Center, Tulane University; Sources: Adam Fairclough.

Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1995.</ref> It was modeled after Mississippi's commission, established in 1956 to resist integration. Davis tapped [[Frank Voelker Jr.]], City Attorney of [[Lake Providence, Louisiana|Lake Providence]], to chair the newly established Commission. It was given unusual {{clarify|date=January 2018}} powers to investigate state citizens, and used its authority to exert economic pressure to suppress civil rights activists. Voelker left the commission in 1963 to run for governor but placed poorly in the primary; he withdrew and supported other candidates.<ref>Havard, Heberle, and Howard, ''The Louisiana Election of 1960'', pg. 99<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>\n\nIn his second term, Davis chose veteran Representative [[J. Thomas Jewell]] of [[New Roads, Louisiana|New Roads]] in [[Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana|Pointe Coupee Parish]] as [[Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives|House Speaker]] to succeed [[Bob Angelle]]. Davis secured passage of a $60&nbsp;million public improvements [[bond issue]] through the State Board and Building Commission, an organization controlled by the governor. He gained legislative support from many formerly pro-Long lawmakers and cemented his hold on the traditional anti-Long bloc. He avoided defeat on any legislation that he strongly supported and was able to defeat nearly all bills with which he did not concur.\n\nHe offered tacit support to Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], national Democrats, to secure the state's hold of pending offshore oil revenues. In the 1963 legislative fiscal session, he defeated efforts to procure an unpledged presidential elector slate for the 1964 general election, by which time he had been succeeded by [[John J. McKeithen]].<ref>Havard, Heberle, and Howard, ''The Louisiana Elections of 1960'', pp. 90\u201392.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>\n\n===Fourth place in 1971===\n{{Main|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1971-72}}\nIn 1971, Davis entered another crowded Democratic [[gubernatorial]] primary field with new political prospects, but he finished in fourth place with 138,756 ballots (11.8 percent).\n\nIn a runoff election held in December 1971, U.S. Representative [[Edwin Washington Edwards]] of [[Crowley, Louisiana|Crowley]], [[Acadia Parish, Louisiana|Acadia Parish]], defeated then state Senator [[Bennett Johnston|J. Bennett Johnston Jr.]], of Shreveport for the party nomination. That vote was close: Edwards, 584,262 (50.2 percent) to Johnston's 579,774 (49.8 percent). Edwards beat Republican [[David C. Treen]] in the state general election held on February 1, 1972. By that time, Davis' days as a politician were clearly behind him.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nToward the end of his life, longtime Democrat Davis endorsed at least two Republican candidates after the state's voters had gone through a political realignment. By the late 20th century, white conservatives in the state largely supported the Republican Party. In 1996 Davis endorsed Republican state representative [[Woody Jenkins]] of Baton Rouge for the U.S. Senate against Democrat [[Mary Landrieu]] of New Orleans, and Governor [[Murphy J. Foster, Jr.|Murphy J. \"Mike\" Foster, Jr.]] seeking re-election in 1999.

Davis coordinated the pay periods of state employees, who had sometimes received their checks a week late, a particular hardship to those with low earnings.\n\nEarl Long once remarked that Davis was so relaxed and low-key that one could not \"wake up Jimmie Davis with an earthquake\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/08/opinion/carville-democrats-could-lose/index.html|title=Carville: Wake up Democrats; you could lose |website=Cnn.com|author=James Carville|accessdate=July 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPublic relations specialist [[Gus Weill]], who worked in the Davis campaign in 1959, wrote a biography of the former governor in 1977, entitled ''You Are My Sunshine,'' based on Davis' best-known song.<ref>''You Are My Sunshine: The Jimmie Davis Story, An Affectionate Biography'' ([[Baton Rouge]]: [[Pelican Publishing Company]], 1977); {{ISBN|0882896601}} (0-88289-660-1)</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[Image:Eglin House in Shreveport IMG 1571.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Davis married the former Alvern Adams in this historic Shreveport house in the Highlands neighborhood.

Two years after her death in 1967, Davis married Anna Gordon, born Effie Juanita Carter (February 15, 1917 &ndash; March 5, 2004). A founding member of the gospel quartet ''The Chuck Wagon Gang'' along with her father and two of her brothers, she had been given the stage name \"Anna\" during the mid-1930s.  Davis was a longtime fan of the group, who were gospel music pioneers with more than 36 million records sold in forty years of affiliation with [[Columbia Records]].  \n\nOut of office, Davis resided primarily in Baton Rouge but made numerous singing appearances, particularly in churches throughout the United States.\n[[Image:Jimmie Davis grave marker IMG 5808.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Davis grave located in small cemetery behind the tabernacle]]\n\nDavis died on November 5, 2000.
