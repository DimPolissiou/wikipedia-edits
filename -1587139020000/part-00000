R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Legendarium]]. It became the heavily fortified [[capital city|capital]] of the kingdom of [[Gondor]] in the second half of the [[Third Age]]. It had originally been built to guard the former capital, [[Osgiliath]], from attack from the west, but became the capital when Osgiliath fell into ruin following the Kin-strife (a civil war) and the [[Gondor#Decline|Great Plague]].\n\nIn ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the city comes under determined attack by the forces of [[Mordor]], culminating in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].\n\n==Names==\n\nThe name ''Minas Tirith'' means \"the Tower of the Sun\" (or \"of Watch\") in [[Sindarin]],<ref>{{cite book |title=The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth |last=Noel |first=Ruth S. |year=1974 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |isbn=0-395-29129-1 |page=170 }}</ref> one of the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elvish]] [[Languages constructed by J.

R. R. Tolkien (1977), ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', 'Of [[Beren and L\u00fathien]]'; ISBN 0 04 823139 8</ref>}}  Minas Ithil was later conquered by Sauron's [[Nazg\u00fbl]] from [[Mordor]] and was renamed ''[[Minas Morgul]]''.\n\nThe city was sometimes called \"the [[#White Tower|White Tower]]\", a [[metonym]] referring to the city's most prominent building.\n\nSome other peoples in [[Middle-earth]] had their own names for Minas Tirith. The [[Rohirrim]] called it Mundburg, while the [[Dr\u00faedain]] referred to it as \"Stone-city\" and \"Stone-houses\".\n\n==Description==\nThe city of Minas Tirith covered an entire hill, the [[Minor places in Middle-earth#Hill of Guard|Hill of Guard]]. This hill was a shoulder of [[Mindolluin]], the mountain which towered behind the city and which was the easternmost peak of the [[White Mountains (Middle-earth)|White Mountains]]. The city was built on seven levels, culminating in [[#Citadel|the Citadel]] at the summit. Each level was about {{Convert|100|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} higher than the one below it, and each surrounded by a high stone wall. These were all white, with the exception of the wall of the First Circle (the lowest level), which was black, built of the same material used for [[Orthanc]]. This outer wall was also the tallest, longest and strongest of the city's seven walls; it was vulnerable only to earthquakes capable of rending the ground where it stood.<ref name=\"Siege of Gondor\" group=T/> Each wall held a gate, and each gate faced a different direction from the next. The city's main street snaked up the eastern hill-face and through each of the gates. Except for the high [[Saddle (landform)|saddle]] of rock which joined the west of the hill to Mindolluin, the city was surrounded by the [[#Pelennor Fields|Pelennor]], an area of farmlands. Minas Tirith's port was a few miles south of the city at [[Gondor#Harlond|Harlond]], where the great river [[Anduin]] made its closest approach to the city.\n\n===Citadel===\n[[File:Flag of the Kings of Gondor.svg|thumb|right|The heraldry of the Kings of Gondor, also worn by the Guards of the Citadel. The design includes the White Tree, which stood in the Citadel.]]\n\nThe [[Citadel]], located on the summit of the city, was the city's seventh and highest level, and was protected by the city's seventh and innermost wall. At an elevation 700 feet higher than the plain surrounding the city, it had a commanding view of the lower vales of [[Anduin]]. The [[#White Tower|White Tower]] stood in the Citadel, and in the Court of the Fountain in front of the Tower grew the [[White Tree]], the symbol of Gondor. The topmost level also contained lodgings for the [[Steward of Gondor]], the King's House, Merethrond the Hall of Feasts, barracks for the Guard of the Citadel, and other buildings for important officials and guests.\n\nThe Guard of the Citadel, which consisted of several companies, protected the city's ruler. In ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Beregond was originally a member of the Guard, and later [[Pippin Took]] was appointed to serve with the Guard.\n\nThe east of the Citadel was the flat top of the great pier of rock which jutted out from the eastern hill-face of Minas Tirith, in line with the Great Gate, which was 700&nbsp;ft (213 m) below the Citadel. The entrance to the Citadel, the Seventh Gate of the city, was in this eastern part. The gate was a tunnel which ran up through the rock pier from the Sixth Circle, where the keystone of the tunnel's archway was carved with the head of a crowned King. Guards of the Citadel manned the Seventh Gate.\n\n====White Tower====\n\nThe White Tower, later also called the Tower of Ecthelion, was the most prominent building in Minas Tirith, and the seat of the rulers of Gondor: the Kings and [[Stewards of Gondor|the Stewards]]. The phrase \"the White Tower\" was also used as a [[metonym]] for the city and its rulers. The [[tower]] stood {{Convert|300|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall (equivalent to 21 [[storey]]s), so that its pinnacle was {{Convert|1000|ft|m|spell=in}} above the plain. The main doors of the tower faced east, onto the Court of the Fountain. Inside these doors was the Tower Hall, the great [[Throne room|throne-room]] where the Kings (or Stewards) held court. Upper storeys included private apartments for the rulers. The [[Palant\u00edr|Seeing-stone of Minas Anor]] rested in a secret chamber at the top of the Tower. A [[Buttery (room)|buttery]] of the Guards of the Citadel was located in the basement of the tower, accessed by a door and stair at the tower's north feet. The White Tower was built by King Calimehtar; it was extensively re-built by Steward Ecthelion I, giving rise to its alternative name, the Tower of Ecthelion.\n\n===Great Gate===\n\nThe Great Gate was the main gate on the first level of the City of Minas Tirith. It was in the City Wall\u2014or Othram\u2014facing eastward across the Pelennor Fields toward the [[Anduin]].\n\nIn front of the Great Gate was a large paved area called the Gateway. The main roads to Minas Tirith met here: the North-way that became the Great West Road to [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]]; the South Road to the southern provinces of Gondor; and the road to Osgiliath, which lay to the north-east of Minas Tirith.\n\nThe Great Gate was constructed of iron and steel and guarded by stone towers and bastions. The doors rolled back to open. Passwords were required to enter each of the city's gates.\n\n====Destruction and renovation====\n\nThe Great Gate was breached during the [[War of the Ring]]. [[Sauron]]'s forces under the command of the [[Witch-king of Angmar]] besieged the City on 13th 'March'. Before dawn on 15th 'March', the massive battering-ram [[Grond (Middle-earth)|Grond]] smashed into the Great Gate three times while the Witch-king spoke words of power. \"As if stricken by some blasting spell it burst asunder: there was a flash of searing lightning, and the doors tumbled in riven fragments to the ground.\"<ref name=\"Siege of Gondor\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"The Siege of Gondor\"</ref> The Witch-king rode through the Gate where [[Aragorn]] awaited him, but then the [[Rohirrim]] arrived and the Witch-king went to fight them in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], where he was killed.\n\nA temporary barricade was erected in place of the Great Gate. After the War, on 1st 'May', [[Aragorn]] received the Crown of Gondor in front of the gate and then entered the City.\n\nThe Great Gate was rebuilt of ''[[mithril]]'' (the hardest of all metals in Tolkien's fiction) and steel by [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] and Dwarves of [[Erebor]] from the [[Lonely Mountain]] who had settled in the [[Glittering Caves]].\n\n===Other gates and levels===\n\nThe gates of the Second Level through the Sixth Level were staggered at different points of their walls. The Second Level gate faced south-east, that of the Third north-east, and so forth. This measure was designed to make capture of the already heavily fortified city even more difficult; it also enabled a gentler gradient for the city's main thoroughfare as it snaked up the hillside.\n\nThe two shoulders of the city's hill divided the second through to the fifth levels into two arc-shaped sectors, each almost a semicircle. The two sectors on each of these levels were connected by a tunnel through the eastern shoulder, a great pier of rock jutting out from the face of the hill. The city's main street passed through these tunnels.\n\nThe western (rear) shoulder of the city's hill was a [[Mountain pass|saddle]] between the city and Mount [[Mindolluin]]. The saddle was occupied by the city's necropolis, called Rath D\u00ednen (the Silent Street), where the tombs of the Kings of Gondor and their [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]] were built. It was reached by a door in the Sixth Level, which was almost closed and hence called Fen Hollen (the Closed Door). The Sixth Level also contained barracks for soldiers, and the famed Houses of Healing.\n\nThe Seventh Gate led to [[#Citadel|the Citadel]]. It faced eastward in line with the Great Gate, which was {{Convert|700|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} below. The Seventh Gate could be reached through a sloping tunnel delved into the pier of rock that jutted out of the eastern face of the Hill of Guard. The keystone of the tunnel's archway was carved with the head of a crowned King. Guards of the Citadel manned the Seventh Gate.\n\n===Pelennor Fields===\n{{further|Battle of the Pelennor Fields}}\n\nThe Pelennor Fields ringed Minas Tirith, and formed the city's \"townlands\": a fertile area of intensive agriculture. It was about 12 miles across. On its west stood the massive bulwark of Mount [[Mindolluin]], and on its east ran the great river [[Anduin]]; \"many rills\" ran across the Pelennor from the highlands to the river. Minas Tirith stood inside its south-west corner. The name ''Pelennor'' means ''fenced land'' in [[Sindarin]].\n\nAfter Minas Ithil had fallen and been renamed [[Minas Morgul]], the Pelennor Fields were enclosed by a great defensive wall: Rammas Echor. The wall had three main gates: north, north-east and south. The north-east gate and accompanying watch-towers were known as the Causeway Forts and were the secured section of the entire wall. This wall was in disrepair shortly before the [[War of the Ring]], but was rebuilt in time on the orders of the Steward, [[Denethor II]].\n \nDuring the War of the Ring, the Pelennor Fields were the location of the largest battle of the [[Third Age]], the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], when [[Uruk-hai]] overran the Rammas Echor by blasting through it and besieged the city. The siege was broken by the arrival of the Rohirrim, though their King [[Th\u00e9oden]] was wounded in the battle. After the [[War of the Ring]], the Rammas Echor was rebuilt by the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] of [[Erebor]], led by [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]].\n\n===Maps===\nMap #40 in Barbara Strachey's ''[[Journeys of Frodo]]'' is a plan of Minas Tirith. Pages 138&139 in [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]]'s revised ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' show a different plan of the city. The only maps by Tolkien are sketches.\n\n==Government==\nThe city of Minas Tirith was administered from its [[#Citadel|Citadel]]. The head of government was the Lord of the City; in the days of the [[Stewards of Gondor]], the Stewards themselves were the Lords of the City.\n\nOther officials included the Warden of the Houses of Healing (in charge of the city's hospital) and the Warden of the Keys. The Warden of the Keys was in charge of the city's security, especially its gates, and the safe-keeping of its treasury, notably the Crown of Gondor. During a period in the [[War of the Ring]], the Warden of the Keys (at that time H\u00farin the Tall) was placed in full command of the city, owing to the absence of the as-yet uncrowned King ([[Aragorn]]) and the convalescence of the Steward ([[Faramir]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nIn Tolkien's fiction, the city was founded by [[Isildur]]. He and his brother [[An\u00e1rion]] were, jointly, the first rulers of Gondor, on behalf of the High King, their father [[Elendil]], who lived in his other kingdom, Arnor. Isildur planted Gondor's second [[White Tree]] in the Citadel of Minas Anor. Forever thereafter, the city was the home of Gondor's lineage of White Trees. Minas Anor grew in importance when Ostoher rebuilt the city as a summer residence for himself and his successors as the Kings of Gondor.\n\n===Capital of Gondor===\nMinas Anor became the capital of Gondor when King Tarondor moved the King's House from [[Osgiliath]] following the Great Plague, which had devastated the population of the much larger and more populous old capital. [[Minas Morgul|Minas Ithil]], was captured by the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] and renamed Minas Morgul. Minas Anor was renamed Minas Tirith, meaning as it took on the role of guarding Gondor against Mordor; it fulfilled this role for the next thousand years. With the rebuilding of the [[Barad-d\u00fbr|Dark Tower]] and the open return of [[Sauron]], the forces of Mordor gathered their strength to topple Minas Tirith in the upcoming [[War of the Ring]].\n\n{{anchor|Rammas Echor}}\n===The War of the Ring===\n\nBy the time of the [[War of the Ring]], Minas Tirith had lost more than half of its soldier population. Many buildings had fallen into disrepair. The city and its lands were surrounded by the Rammas Echor, a fortified wall encircling the [[Pelennor Fields]] and meeting up with [[Osgiliath]], where the Causeway Forts were built on the west bank of the [[Anduin]] and garrisoned. The Rammas proved an ineffective defence. After less than a day, the Uruk-hai breached in the gate. This proved to the detriment of the Uruk-hai when the forces of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] arrived; for, as noted by King [[Th\u00e9oden]], they could have held the Rammas against Rohan's attack.\n\n====Siege====\n[[Faramir]] and his garrison were unable to hold [[Osgiliath]] and the Causeway Forts against the forces of [[Mordor]], and were driven back towards Minas Tirith with heavy loss. Leading the rearguard against the onslaught, Faramir was wounded and nearly slain, but the cavalry charge of Prince [[Imrahil]] of [[Dol Amroth]] and [[Aragorn]] saved him, and the counter-attack allowed the rest of Gondor's soldiers to reach the safety of the city.\n\nMinas Tirith was now [[Siege|besieged]] by a vast army of Uruk-hai and the land fell under the darkness generated by Mordor. Significant damage was done to the first circle of the city but the enemy was unable to break through its great wall\u2014except in one place. [[#Great Gate|The gate of the city]] was broken by a combination of the massive battering-ram [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Grond|Grond]] and the [[Witch-king of Angmar|Witch-king]]'s sorcery; but Aragorn halted the Witch-king at the entrance.\n\nDuring the siege the House of the Stewards in Rath D\u00ednen was destroyed by a fire lit by the Steward [[Denethor II|Denethor]] in suicidal despair at the illness of his son Faramir.<ref name=\"Siege of Gondor\" group=T/><ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"The Pyre of Denethor\"</ref>\n\nThe timely arrival of the [[Rohirrim]] led by their king [[Th\u00e9oden]] forced the Uruk-hai to face the newcomers instead of assaulting the city. The resulting [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] took place on 15 'March' 3019 in [[#Pelennor Fields|the fields]] surrounding the city. Despite heavy losses, Minas Tirith itself was not seriously threatened again, and the battle was won by Gondor and its allies from Rohan and Gondor's fiefs.\n\n===Later===\n\nOn 1 'May' 3019 King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] was crowned on [[#Great Gate|the Gateway]], the threshold of Minas Tirith. Minas Tirith stood firm well into the [[Fourth Age]]. [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli the Dwarf]] and some of [[Durin's folk]] used ''[[mithril]]'', to replace [[#Great Gate|the gates]] that had been broken in the [[War of the Ring]]. The Dwarves improved the layout of the city's streets, and the Elves planted trees in the city. The [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagle]] who brought news of Sauron's defeat to Minas Tirith refers to the city as the Tower of Anor. The eagle might have been speaking poetically, but as ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]'' in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' says, the city is referred to Minas Anor again after Sauron's overthrow.\n\n{{quote|In his time the City was made more fair than it had ever been, even in the days of its first glory; and it was filled with trees and with fountains, and its gates were wrought of ''mithril'' and steel, and its streets were paved with white marble; and the houses were filled with soldiers, and no window was blind nor any courtyard empty; and after the ending of the [[Third Age]] of the world into the new age it preserved the memory and the glory of the years that were gone\".<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"The Steward and the King\"</ref>}}\n\n== Concept and creation ==\n\nNotes made by Tolkien on a map meant to guide the illustrator [[Pauline Baynes]] indicate that Hobbiton maps to the latitude of Oxford and Minas Tirith to that of [[Ravenna]], though it lay \"900 miles east of Hobbiton more near [[Belgrade]]\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Flood |first=Alison |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/23/jrr-tolkien-middle-earth-annotated-map-blackwells-lord-of-the-rings |title=Tolkien's annotated map of Middle-earth discovered inside copy of Lord of the Rings |date=23 October 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Tolkien annotated map of Middle-earth acquired by Bodleian library |url=https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/tolkien-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-acquired-by-bodleian-library/ |publisher=[[Exeter College, Oxford]] |accessdate=9 April 2020 |date=9 May 2016}}</ref> The Tolkien scholar Judy Ann Ford writes that there is also an architectural connection with Ravenna in Pippin's description of the great hall of Denethor, which in her view suggests a Germanic myth of a restored Roman Empire.<ref name=\"Ford2005\">{{cite journal |last=Ford |first=Judy Ann |title=The White City: The Lord of the Rings as an Early Medieval Myth of the Restoration of the Roman Empire |journal=Tolkien Studies |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=53\u201373 |issn=1547-3163 |doi=10.1353/tks.2005.0016}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width = 500\n | image1 = Roturn King-Minas Tirith.jpg\n }}\n\nTolkien's description of the physical layout of the city of Minas Tirith itself is followed relatively faithfully in [[Peter Jackson]]'s film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]],'' (the city also has a cameo in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', when Gandalf goes there to discern the identity of [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s ring, and it also can be seen in the distance for a few seconds when [[Faramir]] takes [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Gollum]] to [[Osgiliath]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'') Jackson's version interprets the top of the rock as flattened and paved, and also the location for the coronation of [[Aragorn]]. As with most other landmarks in the film, the city is portrayed as relatively isolated (the Rammas and Gondor's abundant populace are virtually not featured); the absence of these features is mentioned on the original DVD commentary.\n\nPortions of Minas Tirith were constructed as full-scale sets, and the whole city as a very large, highly detailed miniature or \"[[bigature]]\" by [[Weta Workshop]]. [[Weta Digital]], a division of Weta Workshop, created a remarkably detailed three-dimensional digital model for [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] shots, along with the whole of its surrounding environment including the Pelennor Fields and Mindolluin (but not the Rammas Echor, which was visually omitted from the films despite being mentioned in the dialogue, where [[Th\u00e9oden]] gave the order to the Rohirrim beginning \"After you pass the Wall...\" quoted directly from the book). The set was built on the foundations of the disassembled Helm's Deep set.\n\nCanonically, in total the city is about {{Convert|1000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall\u2014\"[above the citadel] the banner of the Stewards floated a thousand feet above the plain\" (Vi). The towering bastion of stone, shaped like the keel of a ship, which rose from behind the Great Gates on the first level to the citadel on the seventh, was {{Convert|700|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall, and the Tower of Ecthelion was {{Convert|300|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall (Vi).\n\nAccording to the non-canonical New Line book ''The Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare'', the height of Minas Tirith to the top of the Tower of Ecthelion, is about {{Convert|1000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, and the city is almost {{Convert|0.75|mile|m|0|abbr=on}} across. In ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', predating the New Line films by over a decade, [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] estimates the diameter of the city to be somewhat smaller\u2014{{Convert|3100|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} for the First Circle of the City.\n\nIn \"The Complete Tolkien Companion\" Minas Tirith is described in the same way, but is depicted without the rock jutting from the citadel.\n\nIn the novel, the outermost walls of Minas Tirith were black and virtually indestructible, like the similar black surface of [[Orthanc]], as they were built by the [[D\u00fanedain]] before their craft waned in exile. Tolkien says only an earthquake or similar seismic convulsion could cause them significant damage. Jackson depicted all of the walls as white, and many of them were destroyed.\n\nIn the films, the towers of Minas Tirith are equipped with [[trebuchet]]s. However, this superior kind of siege engine is not specifically mentioned in the book.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary===\n::''This list identifies each item's location in Tolkien's writings.''\n{{reflist|group=T|28em}}\n\n===Secondary===\n{{reflist|28em}}\n\n{{Lotr}}\n\n[[Category:Middle-earth populated places]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth castles and fortresses]]\n\n[[de:Regionen und Orte in Tolkiens Welt#Minas Tirith]]\n[[la:Geographia Legendarii Tolkien#Gondor]]\n", "text_old": "{{about-distinguish2|the fictional city in the [[Third Age]] of J.R.R.

At an elevation 700 feet higher than the plain surrounding the city, it had a commanding view of the lower vales of [[Anduin]]. The [[#White Tower|White Tower]] stood in the Citadel, and in the Court of the Fountain in front of the Tower grew the [[White Tree]], the symbol of Gondor. The topmost level also contained lodgings for the [[Steward of Gondor]], the King's House, Merethrond the Hall of Feasts, barracks for the Guard of the Citadel, and other buildings for important officials and guests.\n\nThe Guard of the Citadel, which consisted of several companies, protected the city's ruler. In ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Beregond was originally a member of the Guard, and later [[Pippin Took]] was appointed to serve with the Guard.\n\nThe east of the Citadel was the top of the great pier of rock which jutted out from the eastern hill-face of Minas Tirith, in line with the Great Gate, which was 700 ft (213 m) below the Citadel. The entrance to the Citadel, the Seventh Gate of the city, was in this eastern part. The gate was a tunnel which ran up through the rock pier from the Sixth Circle, where the keystone of the tunnel's archway was carved with the head of a crowned King. Guards of the Citadel manned the Seventh Gate.\n\n====White Tower====\n\nThe White Tower, later also called the Tower of Ecthelion, was the most prominent building in Minas Tirith, and the seat of the rulers of Gondor: the Kings and [[Stewards of Gondor|the Stewards]]. The phrase \"the White Tower\" was also used as a [[metonym]] for the city and its rulers. The [[tower]] stood {{Convert|300|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall (equivalent to 21 [[storey]]s), so that its pinnacle was {{Convert|1000|ft|m|spell=in}} above the plain. The main doors of the tower faced east, onto the Court of the Fountain. Inside these doors was the Tower Hall, the great [[Throne room|throne-room]] where the Kings (or Stewards) held court. Upper storeys included private apartments for the rulers. The [[Palant\u00edr|Seeing-stone of Minas Anor]] rested in a secret chamber at the top of the Tower. A [[Buttery (room)|buttery]] of the Guards of the Citadel was located in the basement of the tower, accessed by a door and stair at the tower's north feet. The White Tower was built by King Calimehtar; it was extensively re-built by Steward Ecthelion I, giving rise to its alternative name, the Tower of Ecthelion.\n\n===Great Gate===\n\nThe Great Gate was the main gate on the first level of the City of Minas Tirith. It was in the City Wall\u2014or Othram\u2014facing eastward across the Pelennor Fields toward the [[Anduin]].\n\nIn front of the Great Gate was a large paved area called the Gateway. The main roads to Minas Tirith met here: the North-way that became the Great West Road to [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]]; the South Road to the southern provinces of Gondor; and the road to Osgiliath, which lay to the north-east of Minas Tirith.\n\nThe Great Gate was constructed of iron and steel and guarded by stone towers and bastions. The doors rolled back to open. Passwords were required to enter each of the city's gates.\n\n====Destruction and renovation====\n\nThe Great Gate was breached during the [[War of the Ring]]. [[Sauron]]'s forces under the command of the [[Witch-king of Angmar]] besieged the City on 13th 'March'. Before dawn on 15th 'March', the massive battering-ram [[Grond (Middle-earth)|Grond]] smashed into the Great Gate three times while the Witch-king spoke words of power. \"As if stricken by some blasting spell it burst asunder: there was a flash of searing lightning, and the doors tumbled in riven fragments to the ground.\"<ref name=\"Siege of Gondor\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"The Siege of Gondor\"</ref> The Witch-king rode through the Gate where [[Gandalf]] awaited him, but then the [[Rohirrim]] arrived and the Witch-king went to fight them in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], where he was killed.\n\nA temporary barricade was erected in place of the Great Gate. After the War, on 1st 'May', [[Aragorn]] received the Crown of Gondor in front of the gate and then entered the City.\n\nThe Great Gate was rebuilt of ''[[mithril]]'' (the hardest of all metals in Tolkien's fiction) and steel by [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] and Dwarves of [[Erebor]] from the [[Lonely Mountain]] who had settled in the [[Glittering Caves]].\n\n===Other gates and levels===\n\nThe gates of the Second Level through the Sixth Level were staggered at different points of their walls. The Second Level gate faced south-east, that of the Third north-east, and so forth. This measure was designed to make capture of the already heavily fortified city even more difficult; it also enabled a gentler gradient for the city's main thoroughfare as it snaked up the hillside.\n\nThe two shoulders of the city's hill divided the second through to the fifth levels into two arc-shaped sectors, each almost a semicircle. The two sectors on each of these levels were connected by a tunnel through the eastern shoulder, a great pier of rock jutting out from the face of the hill. The city's main street passed through these tunnels.\n\nThe western (rear) shoulder of the city's hill was a [[Mountain pass|saddle]] between the city and Mount [[Mindolluin]]. The saddle was occupied by the city's necropolis, called Rath D\u00ednen (the Silent Street), where the tombs of the Kings of Gondor and their [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]] were built. It was reached by a door in the Sixth Level, which was almost always closed and hence called Fen Hollen (the Closed Door). The Sixth Level also contained stables for riders, and the famed Houses of Healing.\n\nThe Seventh Gate led to [[#Citadel|the Citadel]]. It faced eastward in line with the Great Gate, which was {{Convert|700|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} below. The Seventh Gate could be reached through a sloping tunnel delved into the pier of rock that jutted out of the eastern face of the Hill of Guard. The keystone of the tunnel's archway was carved with the head of a crowned King. Guards of the Citadel manned the Seventh Gate.\n\n===Pelennor Fields===\n{{further|Battle of the Pelennor Fields}}\n\nThe Pelennor Fields ringed Minas Tirith, and formed the city's \"townlands\": a fertile area of intensive agriculture. It was about 12 miles across. On its west stood the massive bulwark of Mount [[Mindolluin]], and on its east ran the great river [[Anduin]]; \"many rills\" ran across the Pelennor from the highlands to the river. Minas Tirith stood inside its south-west corner. The name ''Pelennor'' means ''fenced land'' in [[Sindarin]].\n\nAfter Minas Ithil had fallen and been renamed [[Minas Morgul]], the Pelennor Fields were enclosed by a great defensive wall: Rammas Echor. The wall had three main gates: north, north-east and south. The north-east gate and accompanying watch-towers were known as the Causeway Forts and were the strongest section of the entire wall. This wall was in disrepair shortly before the [[War of the Ring]], but was rebuilt in time on the orders of the Steward, [[Denethor II]].\n \nDuring the War of the Ring, the Pelennor Fields were the location of the largest battle of the [[Third Age]], the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], when [[Uruk-hai]] overran the Rammas Echor by blasting through it and besieged the city. The siege was broken by the arrival of the Rohirrim, though their King [[Th\u00e9oden]] was wounded in the battle. After the [[War of the Ring]], the Rammas Echor was rebuilt by the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] of [[Erebor]], led by [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]].\n\n===Maps===\nMap #40 in Barbara Strachey's ''[[Journeys of Frodo]]'' is a plan of Minas Tirith. Pages 138&139 in [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]]'s revised ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' show a different plan of the city. The only maps by Tolkien are sketches.\n\n==Government==\nThe city of Minas Tirith was administered from its [[#Citadel|Citadel]]. The head of government was the Lord of the City; in the days of the [[Stewards of Gondor]], the Stewards themselves were the Lords of the City.\n\nOther officials included the Warden of the Houses of Healing (in charge of the city's hospital) and the Warden of the Keys. The Warden of the Keys was in charge of the city's security, especially its gates, and the safe-keeping of its treasury, notably the Crown of Gondor. During a period in the [[War of the Ring]], the Warden of the Keys (at that time H\u00farin the Tall) was placed in full command of the city, owing to the absence of the as-yet uncrowned King ([[Aragorn]]) and the convalescence of the Steward ([[Faramir]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nIn Tolkien's fiction, the city was originally known as Minas Anor, the \"Tower of the Sun\". It was founded  as a satellite of [[Osgiliath]], the great capital of the nascent kingdom of [[Gondor]], by [[An\u00e1rion]]. He and his brother [[Isildur]] were, jointly, the first rulers of Gondor, on behalf of the High King, their father [[Elendil]], who lived in his other kingdom, Arnor. Isildur planted Gondor's second [[White Tree]] in the Citadel of Minas Anor. Forever thereafter, the city was the home of Gondor's lineage of White Trees. Minas Anor grew in importance when Ostoher rebuilt the city as a summer residence for himself and his successors as the Kings of Gondor.\n\n===Capital of Gondor===\nMinas Anor became the capital of Gondor when King Tarondor moved the King's House from [[Osgiliath]] following the Great Plague, which had devastated the population of the much larger and more populous old capital. Minas Anor's sister-city, [[Minas Morgul|Minas Ithil]], the Tower of the Moon, on the borders of [[Mordor]], was captured by the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] and renamed Minas Morgul, the Tower of Black Sorcery. Minas Anor was renamed Minas Tirith, meaning \"the Tower of Guard\", as it took on the role of guarding Gondor against Mordor; it fulfilled this role for the next thousand years. With the rebuilding of the [[Barad-d\u00fbr|Dark Tower]] and the open return of [[Sauron]], the forces of Mordor gathered their strength to topple Minas Tirith in the upcoming [[War of the Ring]].\n\n{{anchor|Rammas Echor}}\n===The War of the Ring===\n\nBy the time of the [[War of the Ring]], Minas Tirith had lost more than half of its population. Many buildings had fallen into disrepair. The city and its lands were surrounded by the Rammas Echor, a fortified wall encircling the [[Pelennor Fields]] and meeting up with [[Osgiliath]], where the Causeway Forts were built on the west bank of the [[Anduin]] and garrisoned. The Rammas proved an ineffective defence. After less than a day, the orcs breached in the wall. This proved to the detriment of the orcs when the forces of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] arrived; for, as noted by King [[Th\u00e9oden]], they could have held the Rammas against Rohan's attack.\n\n====Siege====\n[[Faramir]] and his garrison were unable to hold [[Osgiliath]] and the Causeway Forts against the forces of [[Mordor]], and were driven back towards Minas Tirith with heavy loss. Leading the rearguard against the onslaught, Faramir was wounded and nearly slain, but the cavalry charge of Prince [[Imrahil]] of [[Dol Amroth]] and [[Gandalf]] saved him, and the counter-attack allowed the rest of Gondor's soldiers to reach the safety of the city.\n\nMinas Tirith was now [[Siege|besieged]] by a vast army from Mordor, including [[Easterlings]] and [[Haradrim]], and the land fell under the darkness generated by Mordor. Significant damage was done to the first circle of the city but the enemy was unable to break through its great wall\u2014except in one place. [[#Great Gate|The gate of the city]] was broken by a combination of the massive battering-ram [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Grond|Grond]] and the [[Witch-king of Angmar|Witch-king]]'s sorcery; but Gandalf halted the Witch-king at the entrance.\n\nDuring the siege the House of the Stewards in Rath D\u00ednen was destroyed by a fire lit by the Steward [[Denethor II|Denethor]] in suicidal despair at the illness of his son Faramir.<ref name=\"Siege of Gondor\" group=T/><ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"The Pyre of Denethor\"</ref>\n\nThe timely arrival of the [[Rohirrim]] led by their king [[Th\u00e9oden]] forced the armies of Mordor to face the newcomers instead of assaulting the city. The resulting [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] took place on 15 'March' 3019 in [[#Pelennor Fields|the fields]] surrounding the city. Despite heavy losses, Minas Tirith itself was not seriously threatened again, and the battle was won by Gondor and its allies from Rohan and Gondor's fiefs.\n\n===Later===\n\nOn 1 'May' 3019 King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] was crowned on [[#Great Gate|the Gateway]], the threshold of Minas Tirith. Minas Tirith stood firm well into the [[Fourth Age]]. [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli the Dwarf]] and some of [[Durin's folk]] used ''[[mithril]]'', a nigh-indestructible metal, to replace [[#Great Gate|the gates]] that had been broken in the [[War of the Ring]]. The Dwarves improved the layout of the city's streets, and the Elves planted trees in the city. The [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagle]] who brought news of Sauron's defeat to Minas Tirith refers to the city as the Tower of Anor. The eagle might have been speaking poetically, but as ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]'' in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' says, the city is referred to Minas Anor again after Sauron's overthrow.\n\n{{quote|In his time the City was made more fair than it had ever been, even in the days of its first glory; and it was filled with trees and with fountains, and its gates were wrought of ''mithril'' and steel, and its streets were paved with white marble; and the Folk of [[Lonely Mountain|the Mountain]] laboured in it, and the Folk of [[Mirkwood|the Wood]] rejoiced to come there; and all was healed and made good, and the houses were filled with men and women and the laughter of children, and no window was blind nor any courtyard empty; and after the ending of the [[Third Age]] of the world into the new age it preserved the memory and the glory of the years that were gone\".<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"The Steward and the King\"</ref>}}\n\n== Concept and creation ==\n\nNotes made by Tolkien on a map meant to guide the illustrator [[Pauline Baynes]] indicate that Hobbiton maps to the latitude of Oxford and Minas Tirith to that of [[Ravenna]], though it lay \"900 miles east of Hobbiton more near [[Belgrade]]\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Flood |first=Alison |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/23/jrr-tolkien-middle-earth-annotated-map-blackwells-lord-of-the-rings |title=Tolkien's annotated map of Middle-earth discovered inside copy of Lord of the Rings |date=23 October 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Tolkien annotated map of Middle-earth acquired by Bodleian library |url=https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/tolkien-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-acquired-by-bodleian-library/ |publisher=[[Exeter College, Oxford]] |accessdate=9 April 2020 |date=9 May 2016}}</ref> The Tolkien scholar Judy Ann Ford writes that there is also an architectural connection with Ravenna in Pippin's description of the great hall of Denethor, which in her view suggests a Germanic myth of a restored Roman Empire.<ref name=\"Ford2005\">{{cite journal |last=Ford |first=Judy Ann |title=The White City: The Lord of the Rings as an Early Medieval Myth of the Restoration of the Roman Empire |journal=Tolkien Studies |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=53\u201373 |issn=1547-3163 |doi=10.1353/tks.2005.0016}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width = 500\n | image1 = Roturn King-Minas Tirith.jpg\n | image2 = Mont Saint-Michel France (cropped).jpg\n | footer = In Peter Jackson's film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', the city was modelled on [[Mont Saint-Michel]].<ref name=\"Morrison 2014\">{{cite web |last1=Morrison |first1=Geoffrey |title=The real-life Minas Tirith from 'Lord of the Rings': A tour of Mont Saint-Michel |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/take-a-tour-of-mont-saint-michel/ |publisher=CNET |date=27 June 2014}}</ref>\n}}\n\nTolkien's description of the physical layout of the city of Minas Tirith itself is followed relatively faithfully in [[Peter Jackson]]'s film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]],'' (the city also has a cameo in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', when Gandalf goes there to discern the identity of [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s ring, and it also can be seen in the distance for a few seconds when [[Faramir]] takes [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Gollum]] to [[Osgiliath]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''. Jackson's version interprets the top of the rock as flattened and paved, and places the coronation of [[Aragorn]] there. As with most other landmarks in the film, the city is portrayed as isolated and sparsely populated.{{cn|date=April 2020}} The appearance and structure of the city was based upon the inhabited [[tidal island]] and [[abbey]] of [[Mont Saint-Michel]], France.<ref name=\"Morrison 2014\"/>\n\nPortions of Minas Tirith were constructed as full-scale sets, and the whole city as a very large, highly detailed miniature or \"[[bigature]]\" by [[Weta Workshop]]. [[Weta Digital]], a division of Weta Workshop, created a remarkably detailed three-dimensional digital model for [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] shots, along with the whole of its surrounding environment including the Pelennor Fields and Mindolluin (but not the Rammas Echor, which was visually omitted from the films despite being mentioned in the dialogue, where [[Th\u00e9oden]] gave the order to the Rohirrim beginning \"After you pass the Wall...\" quoted directly from the book). The set was built on the foundations of the disassembled Helm's Deep set.\n\nIn the novel, the outermost walls of Minas Tirith were black and virtually indestructible, like the similar black surface of [[Orthanc]], as they were built by the [[D\u00fanedain]] before their craft waned in exile. Tolkien says only an earthquake or similar seismic convulsion could cause them significant damage. Jackson depicted all of the walls as white, and many of them were easily destroyed.\n\nIn the films, the towers of Minas Tirith are equipped with [[trebuchet]]s. However, this superior kind of siege engine is not specifically mentioned in the book.\n\nIn the video game ''[[Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'', players in the evil campaign can destroy the city.<ref name=\"conquest\">{{cite web|date=2009-04-06|author=Irish Amabel Capati|url=http://www.pcmag-mideast.com/productreview.aspx?_reviewID=1484&mode=1&pid=0|title=The Lord of the Rings: Conquest|publisher= PC Magazine Middle and Near East |accessdate=20 April 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, there are maps in ''[[Minecraft]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title='Minecraft' Building Ideas: Word Processor, Coliseum And More Of Our Favorite Builds|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/minecraft-building-ideas-word-processor-coliseum-more-our-favorite-builds-1763063|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=28 December 2016|date=18 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Minecraft: Jeder Herrscher w\u00e4re neidisch!

The team, which hastily adopted its identity in midseason when the [[Denver Spurs]] announced plans to sell the team and relocate to Ottawa, existed only for approximately two weeks, folding after only seven games.\n\n==Move to Ottawa==\nThe Denver Spurs began play in the [[Western Hockey League (minor pro)|Western Hockey League]] in 1968, and had been modestly successful in the minors before moving to the WHA in 1975.  However, fans in Denver had been expecting an [[NHL]] team after Spurs owner Ivan Mullenix won a conditional NHL expansion franchise to begin play in 1976-77, only to see those plans fizzle out.\n  \nThe Spurs were plagued by financial difficulties and poor attendance (less than 3,000 per game), widely attributed to the Denver fanbase rejecting the WHA as a minor league.<ref>[http://www.whahockey.com/spurs.html WHAhockey.com - Denver Spurs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  However, they were also dogged by rumors that the NHL was planning to move either the [[Kansas City Scouts]] or the league-owned [[California Golden Seals]] to Denver; the Scouts would indeed eventually move to Denver as the [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]] in the 1976 offseason.  Mullenix knew that he could not possibly compete with an NHL team.  The team unofficially folded in December when Mullenix wanted out, and the league stepped in to broker a deal with an Ottawa group called the Founders Club. While the Spurs were on a road trip in January 1976, the team was quietly moved to Ottawa without even a press release and renamed the Civics. Allegedly, the players only learned of the move at their next road game that night in [[Cincinnati Stingers|Cincinnati]], when they stood on the ice in their Denver jerseys and suddenly heard ''[[O Canada]]'' being played. They lost that night and again the following night in [[Houston Aeros (WHA)|Houston]], then knocked off the [[Minnesota Fighting Saints]] (another squad headed for oblivion before the season was over) in Minnesota, 5-2, on January 4. It would be only victory in the  Civics' short life.\n\nThe Civics played two home games at the [[TD Place Arena|Ottawa Civic Centre]] in front of sellout crowds\u2013against the [[Hartford Whalers|New England Whalers]] on January 7, and against [[Gordie Howe]]'s Aeros on January 15. However, the Founders Club simply did not have the means nor the money to close the purchase, and Mullenix was not interested in operating a team in Ottawa. After the first home game, he gave the Founders Club an ultimatum\u2013come up with $1.2 million within 10 days, or he would fold the team. When it was apparent that the money was not forthcoming, the Civics folded on January 17, 1976 after only playing 7 games as Ottawa.\n\nBecause of the rushed nature of the move, the Civics did not adopt a logo or colours, and continued to wear the Spurs' orange road uniforms for all 7 of their games including their two home games.  Major league hockey would not return to Ottawa until the reborn [[Ottawa Senators|Senators]] joined the NHL in the [[1992\u201393 NHL season|1992-93]] season. The last active Spurs/Civics player in the NHL was [[Ron Delorme]], who retired after the [[1984\u201385 NHL season|1984-85]] season.\n\nThe Civics' 7-game, two-week existence made them easily the shortest-lived team in the WHA's seven-year history, and one of the shortest-lived teams to have ever played a major professional sport. Only the [[Tonawanda Kardex Lumbermen]], whose one week in the [[National Football League]] in 1921 stands as the current record, have a shorter known time span of existence. Combined with the 34 games played as the Spurs, the 41 games was also easily the shortest-lived franchise in WHA history.\n\n==Season-by-season record==\n''This listing includes 34 games played as the Denver Spurs.''\n'''''Note:''' GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes''\n{| cellpadding=5\n|- bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n| '''Season''' || '''GP''' || '''W''' || '''L''' || '''T''' || '''Pts''' || '''GF''' || '''GA''' ||'''PIM''' || '''Finish''' || '''Playoffs'''\n|-\n|[[1975\u201376 WHA season|1975\u201376]] ||41||14||26||1||29||134||172||535|| 5th, Western || Folded mid-season\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ice hockey in Ottawa]]\n*[[List of ice hockey teams in Ontario]]\n*[[List of WHA seasons]]\n*[[Ottawa Nationals]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://nitzyshockeyden.blogspot.com/2015/07/wha-ottawa-civics-two-week-franchise.html WHA Ottawa Civics, The Two Week Franchise ] - Detailed write up on the team's brief existence as well as rare photos from their two home games.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{WHA}}\n\n[[Category:Defunct ice hockey teams in Canada]]\n[[Category:Ice hockey teams in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Ice hockey teams in Ottawa|Civ]]\n[[Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1976]]\n[[Category:Ice hockey clubs disestablished in 1976]]\n[[Category:World Hockey Association teams]]\n", "text_old": "{{Pro hockey team |CAN_eng=1|\n| team     = Ottawa Civics\n| city     = [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]\n| league   = [[World Hockey Association]]\n| operated = [[1975\u201376 WHA season|1976]]\n| arena    = [[Ottawa Civic Centre]]\n| owner    = Ivan Mullenix<!---Ottawa investors completed purchase, so Ivan folded team --->\n| media    = [[TVOntario]]<br>[[CIWW|CKOY]]\n<!---Franchise history--->\n| name1    = [[Denver Spurs]]\n| dates1   = 1975\u20131976<br>(to January 1)\n| name2    = '''Ottawa Civics'''\n| dates2   = 1976<br>(folded January 17)\n}}\n\nThe '''Ottawa Civics''' was a professional [[ice hockey]] team based out of [[Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada, that played in the [[World Hockey Association]]. The team, which hastily adopted its identity in midseason when the [[Denver Spurs]] announced plans to sell the team and relocate to Ottawa, existed only for approximately two weeks, folding after only seven games.\n\n==Move to Ottawa==\nThe Denver Spurs began play in the [[Western Hockey League (minor pro)|Western Hockey League]] in 1968, and had been modestly successful in the minors before moving to the WHA in 1975.  However, fans in Denver had been expecting an [[NHL]] team after Spurs owner Ivan Mullenix won a conditional NHL expansion franchise to begin play in 1976-77, only to see those plans fizzle out.\n  \nThe Spurs were plagued by financial difficulties and poor attendance (less than 3,000 per game), widely attributed to the Denver fanbase rejecting the WHA as a minor league.<ref>[http://www.whahockey.com/spurs.html WHAhockey.com - Denver Spurs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  However, they were also dogged by rumors that the NHL was planning to move either the [[Kansas City Scouts]] or the league-owned [[California Golden Seals]] to Denver; the Scouts would indeed eventually move to Denver as the [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]] in the 1976 offseason.  Mullenix knew that he could not possibly compete with an NHL team.  The team unofficially folded in December when Mullenix wanted out, and the league stepped in to broker a deal with an Ottawa group called the Founders Club. While the Spurs were on a road trip in January 1976, the team was quietly moved to Ottawa without even a press release and renamed the Civics. Allegedly, the players only learned of the move at their next road game that night in [[Cincinnati Stingers|Cincinnati]], when they stood on the ice in their Denver jerseys and suddenly heard ''[[O Canada]]'' being played. They lost that night and again the following night in [[Houston Aeros (WHA)|Houston]], then knocked off the [[Minnesota Fighting Saints]] (another squad headed for oblivion before the season was over) in Minnesota, 5-2, on January 4. It would be only victory in the  Civics' short life.\n\nThe Civics played two home games at the [[TD Place Arena|Ottawa Civic Centre]] in front of sellout crowds\u2013against the [[Hartford Whalers|New England Whalers]] on January 7, and against [[Gordie Howe]]'s Aeros on January 15. However, the Founders Club simply did not have the means nor the money to close the purchase, and Mullenix was not interested in operating a team in Ottawa. After the first home game, he gave the Founders Club an ultimatum\u2013come up with $1.2 million within 10 days, or he would fold the team. When it was apparent that the money was not forthcoming, the Civics folded on January 17, 1976 after only playing 7 games as Ottawa.\n\nBecause of the rushed nature of the move, the Civics did not adopt a logo or colours, and continued to wear the Spurs' orange road uniforms for all 7 of their games including their two home games.  Major league hockey would not return to Ottawa until the reborn [[Ottawa Senators|Senators]] joined the NHL in the [[1992\u201393 NHL season|1992-93]] season. The last active Spurs/Civics player in the NHL was [[Ron Delorme]], who retired after the [[1984\u201385 NHL season|1984-85]] season.\n\nThe Civics' 7-game, two-week existence made them easily the shortest-lived team in the WHA's seven-year history, and one of the shortest-lived teams to have ever played a major professional sport. Only the [[Tonawanda Kardex Lumbermen]], whose one week in the [[National Football League]] in 1921 stands as the current record, have a shorter known time span of existence.

The seemingly intractable falling standard in public sector education and the demand among most parents for schools with high academic standards, as well as the inculcation of Christian values served as the necessary impetus for the creation of Caleb Nursery and Primary School.\n\nThe high academic attainment within the school, coupled with the exemplary moral behaviour of the students increased demand for places in the school. Parents also began to yearn for a secondary institution that emphasizes the same objectives, ambitions, values and teaching methods. This, logically, paved the way for the establishment of Caleb International College in Magodo GRA, Lagos, in 1995.\n\nThe college served as a natural transition path for many pupils who have attended Caleb Primary School. Within a few years of establishment, the performances of the college students at the Junior and Senior Secondary School Certificate examinations (JSCE/SSCE) quickly established Caleb amongst the ranks of high flying secondary schools in the Country. The college expanded its extra-curricular programme, expanded its music band, and included overseas study tours for its students from 1999.\n\nIn 1999, application for places at the College reached unprecedented levels, with full applications to every available place. Such positive interest agitated the need for a bigger location. Caleb International College continued the rich tradition of moral and academic excellence and sometime in 2003, a branch of the College was established in Lekki to cater for parents residing in the Ikoyi, Victoria Island and Lekki axis of Lagos.\nTo maintain its position as a prime provider of qualitative education and respond to the industrial demands for staff of true international calibre, the establishment initiated the necessary process for the introduction of a Cambridge O level programme and International General Certificate of Education (IGCSE) in 2004. Caleb's position as an international organization was truly recognized in 2004 when it was admitted as a full member of the International School's Association (ISA).\n\nPrince Adebogun also felt deeply inspired to establish a university that will do for tertiary education, what Caleb has creditably done for primary and secondary education and in response to the invitation of the Federal Government of Nigeria through Act no. 9 of 1993 to allow Private Corporate bodies or individual Nigerian Citizens to establish and run Universities, subject to meeting approved guidelines such as having an approved Academic Brief, Master plan, University Law and proven ability to finance such a project.\n\nBy 2005 much progress had been recorded with the production of the Draft Academic brief, Draft University Law and purchase of over 100 acres of land in Imota, Lagos State. By November of the same year, the first NUC- SCOPU verification visit took place while the final NUC-SCOPU verification was held in May, 2006. To the Glory of God, on 17 May 2007. The Federal Government of Nigeria granted probational operational License for Caleb University to operate as a private University. The University started full academic program with admission of its first set of students, a total of 83 male and 58 female students on Monday, 7 January 2008.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://calebuniversity.edu.ng/ Caleb  University Official Website]\n{{Universities in Nigeria}}\n{{Lagos|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Nigeria]]\n[[Category:1995 establishments in Nigeria]]\n[[Category:Education in Lagos State]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1995]]\n[[Category:Ikorodu]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=August 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2017}}\n{{Infobox university\n |name              = Caleb University\n |image_name        =\n |motto             = For God and Humanity\n |established       = 7 January 2008\n |type              = Private\n |chancellor        = Mobolaji Olufunso Johnson\n |vice_chancellor = \nProf. Nosa Owens-Ibie \n |city              = [[Imota]]\n |state             = [[Lagos State]]\n |country           = [[Nigeria]]\n |website           = http://www.calebuniversity.edu.ng/\n|founder            =Prince Oladega Adebogun\n}}\n\n'''Caleb  University''' is a private university located in [[Imota]], [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.4icu.org/reviews/10778.htm | title=Caleb University | publisher=www.4icu.org/ | accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://pulse.ng/student/know-your-university-nigeria-s-59-private-universities-locations-vice-chancellors-names-websites-dates-of-establishment-id3687732.html | title=Nigeria\u2019s 59 private universities \u2026locations, Vice Chancellors names, websites, dates of establishment | publisher=pulse.ng | work=Kukogho Iruesiri Samson | date=22 April 2015 | accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe systematic history of Caleb University dates back to 1986 when Prince Oladega Adebogun planted the initial seed for a nursery and primary school in the heart of Mainland [[Lagos]].

Within a few years of establishment, the performances of the college students at the Junior and Senior Secondary School Certificate examinations (JSCE/SSCE) quickly established Caleb amongst the ranks of high flying secondary schools in the Country. The college expanded its extra-curricular programme, expanded its music band, and included overseas study tours for its students from 1999.\n\nIn 1999, application for places at the College reached unprecedented levels, with full applications to every available place. Such positive interest agitated the need for a bigger location. Caleb International College continued the rich tradition of moral and academic excellence and sometime in 2003, a branch of the College was established in Lekki to cater for parents residing in the Ikoyi, Victoria Island and Lekki axis of Lagos.\nTo maintain its position as a prime provider of qualitative education and respond to the industrial demands for staff of true international calibre, the establishment initiated the necessary process for the introduction of a Cambridge O level programme and International General Certificate of Education (IGCSE) in 2004. Caleb's position as an international organization was truly recognized in 2004 when it was admitted as a full member of the International School's Association (ISA).\n\nPrince Adebogun also felt deeply inspired to establish a university that will do for tertiary education, what Caleb has creditably done for primary and secondary education and in response to the invitation of the Federal Government of Nigeria through Act no. 9 of 1993 to allow Private Corporate bodies or individual Nigerian Citizens to establish and run Universities, subject to meeting approved guidelines such as having an approved Academic Brief, Master plan, University Law and proven ability to finance such a project.\n\nBy 2005 much progress had been recorded with the production of the Draft Academic brief, Draft University Law and purchase of over 100 acres of land in Imota, Lagos State. By November of the same year, the first NUC- SCOPU verification visit took place while the final NUC-SCOPU verification was held in May, 2006. To the Glory of God, on 17 May 2007. The Federal Government of Nigeria granted probational operational License for Caleb University to operate as a private University. The University started full academic program with admission of its first set of students, a total of 83 male and 58 female students on Monday, 7 January 2008.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://calebuniversity.edu.ng/ Caleb  University Official Website]\n{{Universities in Nigeria}}\n{{Lagos|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Nigeria]]\n[[Category:1995 establishments in Nigeria]]\n[[Category:Education in Lagos State]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1995]]\n[[Category:Ikorodu]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_University"}

Beginning in 2005, Byrne has contended that a number of companies, including Overstock.com, have been the targets of this practice, which involves selling a stock short but without the usual step of initially borrowing or locating the shares. Byrne alleges that the practice circumvents safeguards of conventional shorting, and has been used in large schemes devised to profit from driving down the prices of companies' shares, in many cases leading to these companies' failure. With Overstock, Byrne contends that the company's longstanding appearance on the Regulation SHO Threshold Security list, an SEC-mandated list showing companies with a high number of \"fails to deliver\", along with high trading volumes that sometimes surpass total quantity of the company's stock, establish that it has been targeted by this practice.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS189862+27-Dec-2007+PRN20071227|first=Kirstie|last=Burden|title=Overstock Reappears on the Regulation SHO Threshold List|agency=Reuters|date=December 27, 2007|accessdate=March 22, 2008|work=[[PR Newswire]]}}</ref> Byrne's campaign has been controversial, including criticism in the financial press that Byrne is seeking to divert attention from Overstock's share price declines and failure to turn a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]].<ref name=\"Antilla\">{{cite news|first=Susan|last=Antilla|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&sid=aLDKLcXDf9PU&refer=columnist_antilla|title=Overstock Blames with Creepy Strategy|date=February 21, 2007|accessdate=March 22, 2008|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]}}</ref> New York Times columnist [[Joseph Nocera]] has said in 2006 that, \"Except for a few fellow-traveling Web sites, where Mr. Byrne is viewed as a heroic figure, most people who understand the issue or have looked into it think it's pretty bogus.\"<ref name=\"nocera\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/10/business/10nocera.html|title=New Crusade for Master of Overstock|date=June 10, 2006|accessdate=March 22, 2008|first=Joe|last=Nocera|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Others have suggested that the problem is real, but that the SEC acts to prevent it and that it does not happen on any scale such as Byrne suggests.
