Sinfree B. Makoni argues that the concept \"contains a powerful sense of social romanticism, creating an illusion of equality in a highly asymmetrical world, particularly in contexts characterized by a search for homogenization...I find it disconcerting, to say the least, to have an open celebration of diversity in societies marked by violent xenophobia, such as South Africa\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=A Critique of Language, Languaging and Supervernacular|first=Sinfree B.|last=Makoni|journal=Muitas Vozes|volume=1|issue=2|pages=189\u2013199|year=2012|doi=10.5212/MuitasVozes.v.1i2.0003}}</ref>\nAna Deumert argues:  \u201cThe use of \u2018superdiverse\u2019 as a descriptive adjective, is a theoretical cul-de-sac, because the complexities brought about by diversity in the social world ultimately defy numerical measurement\u201d<ref> Deumert, A.

Discourse, Context, and Media,4-5, 116-120].</ref>\nThe claims of increased migrations and diversity have been challenged by Czajka and de Haas (2014). They observe that while globally the number of migrants has increased so has the world population so the ''proportion'' of  migrants has actually decreased. In the Americas migration has increased but diversity hasn't. The fact that migrations have centered on a \u201cshrinking pool of prime destination countries\u201d (many of them small countries in Western Europe) led them to conclude that \u201cthe idea that immigration has become more diverse may partly reveal a Eurocentric worldview\u201d<ref>Czajka, M. & de Haas (2014) [http://iussp.org/sites/default/files/event_call_for_papers/The%20Globalization%20of%20Migration_extended%20abstract.pdf The globalization of migration: Has the world become more migratory]? International Migration Review, 48, 2, 283-323.</ref>\nAneta Pavlenko argues that superdiversity is an exercise in academic branding which fails as an academic term:<ref>Pavlenko, A (2016) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292157452_Superdiversity_and_why_it_isn't_Reflections_on_terminological_innovations_and_academic_branding Superdiversity and why it isn't: Reflections on terminological innovations and academic branding] </ref>\n{{quote|text=The uptake of the slippery slogan is not surprising. The aesthetic appeal of truthiness and the illusion of novelty, contemporaneity and relevance undoubtedly explain some of the attraction yet we cannot ignore the fact that the advent of superdiversity provided scholars of multilingualism with a new means to move up the academic ladder, distinguish their publications, and fund their work.}}\n\n==Researchers and research institutes==\nKey researchers working on superdiversity include Vertovec, [[Jan Blommaert]] and Jenny Phillimore.

They observe that while globally the number of migrants has increased so has the world population so the ''proportion'' of  migrants has actually decreased . In the Americas migration has increased but diversity hasn't. The fact that migrations have centered on a \u201cshrinking pool of prime destination countries\u201d  (many of them small countries in Western Europe) led them to conclude that \u201cthe idea that immigration has become more diverse may partly reveal a Eurocentric worldview\u201d<ref>Czajka, M. & de Haas (2014) [http://iussp.org/sites/default/files/event_call_for_papers/The%20Globalization%20of%20Migration_extended%20abstract.pdf The globalization of migration: Has the world become more migratory]?

Boat engines vary in shape, size and type. Engines are installed either inboard or outboard. Inboard engines are part of the boat construction, while outboard engines are secured to the transom and hang off the back of the boat. Motorboat engines run on gasoline or diesel fuel. Engines come in various types. Engines vary in fuel type such as: gasoline, diesel, gas turbine, rotary combustion or steam. Motorboats are commonly used for recreation, sport or racing. [[Boat racing]] is a sport where drivers and engineers compete for fastest boat. The American Powerboat Association (APBA) splits the sport into categories. The categories include: inboard, inboard endurance, professional outboard, stock outboard, unlimited outboard performance craft, drag, modified outboard and offshore. Engines and [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]s categorize racing. The two types of hull shape are [[Runabout (boat)|runabout]] and hydroplane. Runabout is a v-shape and hydroplane is flat and stepped.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Wagnalls|first=|date=2017|title=Motorboat Racing|url=|journal=World Book|volume=|pages=1|via=}}</ref> The type of hull used depends on the type of water the boat is in and how the boat is being used.

Hacker]]. His pioneering work, including the invention of the V-hull and the use of dedicated petrol engines revolutionized boat design from as early as 1908, when he founded the [[Hacker-Craft|Hacker Boat Co]]. In 1911, Hacker designed the ''Kitty Hawk'', the first successful step [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]] which exceeded the then-unthinkable speed of {{convert|50|mph|abbr=on}} and was at that time the fastest boat in the world. The Harmsworth Cup was first won by Americans in 1907.<ref name=\"lesliefield\"/> The US and England traded it back and forth until 1920. From 1920-1933, Americans had an unbroken winning streak. [[Garfield Wood|Gar Wood]] won this race eight times as a driver and nine times as an owner between 1920 and 1933.\n\n== Hull type  ==\nThe type of [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] depends on the usage and type of water that the boat is being used in. Types of hulls include displacement hulls, vee-bottom hulls, modified vee-bottom hulls, deep-vee hulls and trim tabs for vee-bottom hulls. Hulls can be made of different materials. The three main materials are wood, reinforced fiberglass and metal. Wood hulls may be made of planks or plywood. Fiberglass hulls are reinforced with balsa wood. Metal hulls are either aluminum or steel.<ref name=\":1\" />\nThe hulls of recreational motorboats are distinguished between day cruiser, [[bow rider]], pilothouse and [[cabin cruiser]]. The upper construction of each has different features according to its specific use. They differ especially by size of cabin, dimension of half deck, helmsman armchair and crew seats position.<ref>{{cite web |title=Motorboat hull - mBoat |url=https://mboat.eu/motorboat/ |website=www.mBoat.eu |accessdate=24 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Racing  ==\nPowerboat racing engine categories for inboard and outboard engines range from 7.5 cu in to 60 cu in. Categories range from 44 cu in to 450 cu in for inboard only. The two types of motorboat races are speed races and predicted-log race. Speed races involve boats with powerful engines competing for quickest time and take place on freshwater bodies of water on a closed course. Races are marked by buoys. For unlimited hydroplanes the race distance ranges from 5 miles to 30 miles. Hydroplanes are drag raced. Predicted-log races involve slow cabin cruisers. Predicted-log races is a competition of planning and carrying out a sea voyage. The contestants evaluate different factors and variables that they will encounter along the way. The contestant with the least error at the end of the race is the winner. Also, speedboat tour is a common tourist attraction, especially in Dubai.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Motorsailers  ==\nSome motorboats are also sailboats. Motorsailers are adaptable and can both sail and motor in all conditions. They tend to be inefficient in certain conditions where either a sail-only or motor-only boat would be ideal for.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Motorsailers|last=Pike|first=David|publisher=Stanford Maritime Limited|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Military application  ==\nA fast craft is a vessel capable of speeds over 30 knots. HSICs (High Speed Interceptor Craft) however, trump fast craft with speeds of over 50 knots. HSICs are usually either custom or law enforcement craft. Law enforcement use these extremely fast boats to catch criminals such as smugglers or drug traffickers who use fast craft as well. The military have started to use HSICs to stop international threats such as pirates, militias, terrorists and weapons traffickers. Originally HSICs were not meant to carry large weapons. Now that the military is using them, they are being built with heavy machine guns. The boats have to be fitted with robust weight control and at the same time have heavy amour. HSICs must do without propellers to account for cavitation and vibrations.  Instead HSICs use surface drivers or water jets.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nHacker Runabout 2010.jpg|A 2010 [[Hacker-Craft]] triple cockpit runabout\n22 ft Spencer Runabout.jpg|2004, 22&nbsp;ft Spencer runabout\n1928 Chris Craft Cadet.jpg|1928 [[Chris-Craft Industries|Chris Craft]] Cadet\n1929 Richardson Croisette.jpg|1929 Richardson Croisette, 29 foot, Chrysler Ace engine\nSpeed boat and water skiier.jpg|A motorboat pulling a waterskier\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Electric boat]]\n*[[Go-fast boat]]\n*[[Launch (boat)]]\n*[[Motor launch]]\n*[[Powerboating]]\n*[[Sterndrive]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Motorboats}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Nautical terminology]]\n[[Category:Motorboats| ]]\n[[Category:Vehicles introduced in 1886]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Boat which is powered by an engine}}\n{{redirect|Powerboat}}\n{{for|the novel|Speedboat (novel)}}\n{{distinguish|Motor ship}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{confusing|date=June 2018}}\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2007}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Motorboat at Kankaria lake.JPG|thumb|right|A motorboat with an [[outboard motor]]]]\n\nA '''motorboat''', '''speedboat,''' or '''powerboat''' is a [[boat]] that is powered by an [[engine]].\n\nSome motorboats are fitted with [[inboard motor|inboard engine]]s, others have an [[outboard motor]] installed on the rear, containing the [[internal combustion engine]], the [[gear reduction|gearbox]] and the [[propeller]] in one portable unit. An inboard-outboard contains a hybrid of an inboard and an outboard, where the internal combustion engine is installed inside the boat, and the gearbox and propeller are outside.\n\nThere are two configurations of an inboard, V-drive and direct drive.  A direct drive has the powerplant mounted near the middle of the boat with the propeller shaft straight out the back, where a V-drive has the powerplant mounted in the back of the boat facing backwards having the shaft go towards the front of the boat then making a ''V'' towards the rear.  The V-drive has become increasingly popular due to [[wakeboarding]] and [[wakesurfing]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}{{dubious|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:Lazzara 80 Sky Lounge enclosed bridge photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|Lazzara 80 Sky Lounge enclosed bridge]]\n\n==History==\n===Invention===\n[[File:Stuttgart-cannstatt-daimler-boot-neckar-1886.jpg|thumb|Model of the first motor boat constructed by [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] in 1886]]\nAlthough the [[Propeller|screw propeller]] had been added to an engine ([[steam engine]]) as early as the 18th century in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], by [[James Watt]], boats powered by a [[petrol engine]] only came about in the later part of the 19th century with the invention of the [[internal combustion engine]].\n\nThe earliest boat to be powered by a petrol engine was tested on the [[Neckar]] River by [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] in 1886, when they tested their new \"longcase clock\" engine.

Boat engines vary in shape, size and type. Engines are installed either inboard or outboard. Inboard engines are part of the boat construction, while outboard engines are secured to the transom and hang off the back of the boat. Motorboat engines run on gasoline or diesel fuel. Engines come in various types. Engines vary in fuel type such as: gasoline, diesel, gas turbine, rotary combustion or steam. Motorboats are commonly used for recreation, sport or racing. [[Boat racing]] is a sport where drivers and engineers compete for fastest boat. The American Powerboat Association (APBA) splits the sport into categories. The categories include: inboard, inboard endurance, professional outboard, stock outboard, unlimited outboard performance craft, drag, modified outboard and offshore. Engines and [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]s categorize racing. The two types of hull shape are [[Runabout (boat)|runabout]] and hydroplane.

Metal hulls are either aluminum or steel.<ref name=\":1\" />\nThe hulls of recreational motorboats are distinguished between day cruiser, [[bow rider]], pilothouse and [[cabin cruiser]]. The upper construction of each has different features according to its specific use. They differ especially by size of cabin, dimension of half deck, helmsman armchair and crew seats position.<ref>{{cite web |title=Motorboat hull - mBoat |url=https://mboat.eu/motorboat/ |website=www.mBoat.eu |accessdate=24 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Racing  ==\nPowerboat racing engine categories for inboard and outboard engines range from 7.5 cu in to 60 cu in. Categories range from 44 cu in to 450 cu in for inboard only. The two types of motorboat races are speed races and predicted-log race. Speed races involve boats with powerful engines competing for quickest time and take place on freshwater bodies of water on a closed course. Races are marked by buoys. For unlimited hydroplanes the race distance ranges from 5 miles to 30 miles. Hydroplanes are drag raced. Predicted-log races involve slow cabin cruisers. Predicted-log races is a competition of planning and carrying out a sea voyage. The contestants evaluate different factors and variables that they will encounter along the way. The contestant with the least error at the end of the race is the winner. Also, speedboat tour is a common tourist attraction, especially in Dubai.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Motorsailers  ==\nSome motorboats are also sailboats. Motorsailers are adaptable and can both sail and motor in all conditions. They tend to be inefficient in certain conditions where either a sail-only or motor-only boat would be ideal for.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Motorsailers|last=Pike|first=David|publisher=Stanford Maritime Limited|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Military application  ==\nA fast craft is a vessel capable of speeds over 30 knots. HSICs (High Speed Interceptor Craft) however, trump fast craft with speeds of over 50 knots. HSICs are usually either custom or law enforcement craft. Law enforcement use these extremely fast boats to catch criminals such as smugglers or drug traffickers who use fast craft as well. The military have started to use HSICs to stop international threats such as pirates, militias, terrorists and weapons traffickers. Originally HSICs were not meant to carry large weapons. Now that the military is using them, they are being built with heavy machine guns. The boats have to be fitted with robust weight control and at the same time have heavy amour. HSICs must do without propellers to account for cavitation and vibrations.  Instead HSICs use surface drivers or water jets.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nHacker Runabout 2010.jpg|A 2010 [[Hacker-Craft]] triple cockpit runabout\n22 ft Spencer Runabout.jpg|2004, 22&nbsp;ft Spencer runabout\n1928 Chris Craft Cadet.jpg|1928 [[Chris-Craft Industries|Chris Craft]] Cadet\n1929 Richardson Croisette.jpg|1929 Richardson Croisette, 29 foot, Chrysler Ace engine\nSpeed boat and water skiier.jpg|A motorboat pulling a waterskier\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Electric boat]]\n*[[Go-fast boat]]\n*[[Launch (boat)]]\n*[[Motor launch]]\n*[[Powerboating]]\n*[[Sterndrive]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Motorboats}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Nautical terminology]]\n[[Category:Motorboats| ]]\n[[Category:Vehicles introduced in 1886]]\n", "name_user": "HopsonRoad", "label": "safe", "comment": "Move text overview", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorboat"}
