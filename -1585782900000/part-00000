John Twiggs and brothers Col. William Few and Benjamin Few, along with 250 men, defeated British in the Battle of Burke Jail.\n\nBurke County is located within the CSRA (the Central Savannah River Area). During the antebellum period, it was developed by slave labor for large cotton plantations. The county was majority African American in population in this period, as slaveholders needed high numbers of slaves for laborers to cultivate and process cotton.\n\nThe military tradition continued during the American Civil War, when Burke County provided volunteers for numerous units: the 2nd Regiment Georgia Infantry Company D (Burke Sharpshooters), 3rd Regiment Georgia Infantry Company A (Burke Guards), 32nd Regiment Georgia Infantry Company C (Williams Volunteers), 32nd Regiment Georgia Infantry Company K (Alexander Greys), 48th Regiment Georgia Infantry Company D (Burke Volunteers), Cobb's Legion Infantry company E (Poythress Volunteers), and the Cobb's Legion Cavalry Company F (Grubb's Hussars).\n\nAgriculture continued as the basis of the economy for decades after the [[American Civil War]], when most [[freedmen]] worked as sharecroppers or tenant farmers. Cotton was the major commodity crop.<ref>[http://www.csrardc.org/]</ref> In the early 20th century, mechanization of agriculture caused many African-American farm workers to lose their jobs.\n\nAs can be seen from the census tables below, the county lost population from 1910\u20131920, and from 1930\u20131970. Part of the decline was related to the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], as millions of African Americans left the rural South and [[Jim Crow]] oppression for jobs and opportunities in industrial cities of the Midwest, North. From World War II on, primary migration destinations were West Coast cities because of the buildup of the defense industry. In addition, whites left rural areas for industrial jobs in the North, in cities such as Chicago and Detroit.\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|835|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|827|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|8.0|sqmi}} (1.0%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is the second-largest county by area in Georgia.\n\nThe southern half of Burke County, defined by a line running along [[Georgia State Route 80|State Route 80]] to [[Waynesboro, Georgia|Waynesboro]], then southeast  to east of [[Perkins, Georgia|Perkins]], is located in the Upper [[Ogeechee River]] sub-basin of the Ogeechee River basin.

John Twiggs and brothers Col. William Few and Benjamin Few, along with 250 men, defeated British in the Battle of Burke Jail.\n\nBurke County is located within the CSRA (the Central Savannah River Area). During the antebellum period, it was developed by slave labor for large cotton plantations. The county was majority African American in population in this period, as slaveholders needed high numbers of slaves for laborers to cultivate and process cotton.\n\nThe military tradition continued during the American Civil War, when Burke County provided volunteers for numerous units: the 2nd Regiment Georgia Infantry Company D (Burke Sharpshooters), 3rd Regiment Georgia Infantry Company A (Burke Guards), 32nd Regiment Georgia Infantry Company C (Williams Volunteers), 32nd Regiment Georgia Infantry Company K (Alexander Greys), 48th Regiment Georgia Infantry Company D (Burke Volunteers), Cobb's Legion Infantry company E (Poythress Volunteers), and the Cobb's Legion Cavalry Company F (Grubb's Hussars).\n\nAgriculture continued as the basis of the economy for decades after the [[American Civil War]], when most [[freedmen]] worked as sharecroppers or tenant farmers. Cotton was the major commodity crop.<ref>[http://www.csrardc.org/]</ref> In the early 20th century, mechanization of agriculture caused many African-American farm workers to lose their jobs.\n\nAs can be seen from the census tables below, the county lost population from 1910-1920, and from 1930-1970. Part of the decline was related to the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], as millions of African Americans left the rural South and [[Jim Crow]] oppression for jobs and opportunities in industrial cities of the Midwest, North. From World War II on, primary migration destinations were West Coast cities because of the buildup of the defense industry. In addition, whites left rural areas for industrial jobs in the North, in cities such as Chicago and Detroit.\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|835|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|827|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|8.0|sqmi}} (1.0%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is the second-largest county by area in Georgia.\n\nThe southern half of Burke County, defined by a line running along [[Georgia State Route 80|State Route 80]] to [[Waynesboro, Georgia|Waynesboro]], then southeast  to east of [[Perkins, Georgia|Perkins]], is located in the Upper [[Ogeechee River]] sub-basin of the Ogeechee River basin.

The average household size was 2.77 and the average family size was 3.27.\n\nIn the county, the population was spread out with 31.30% under the age of 18, 9.10% from 18 to 24, 27.30% from 25 to 44, 21.40% from 45 to 64, and 10.90% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.30 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.60 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the county was $27,877, and the median income for a family was $31,660. Males had a median income of $29,992 and females had an income of $19,008. The [[per capita income]] for the county was $13,136.  About 23.80% of families and 28.70% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 39.00% of those under age 18 and 29.80% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Waynesboro, Georgia#Education}}\n\n==Communities==\n* [[Drone, Georgia|Drone]]\n* [[Girard, Georgia|Girard]]\n* [[Gough, Georgia|Gough]]\n* [[Keysville, Georgia|Keysville]]\n* [[Midville, Georgia|Midville]]\n* [[Sardis, Georgia|Sardis]]\n* [[Vidette, Georgia|Vidette]]\n* [[Waynesboro, Georgia|Waynesboro]]\n\n==Politics==\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Previous presidential elections results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-03-18}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

These consequences can range from benign (e.g. synonymous mutations) to catastrophic (e.g. [[frameshift mutations]]), with regard to protein production, composition, and function.\n\n==Causes==\nPoint mutations usually take place during [[DNA replication]]. DNA replication occurs when one double-stranded DNA molecule creates two single strands of DNA, each of which is a template for the creation of the complementary strand. A single point mutation can change the whole DNA sequence. Changing one [[purine]] or [[pyrimidine]] may change the amino acid that the [[nucleotide]]s code for.\n\nPoint mutations may arise from spontaneous [[mutation]]s that occur during [[DNA replication]]. The rate of mutation may be increased by [[mutagen]]s. Mutagens can be physical, such as radiation from [[ultraviolet light|UV rays]], [[X-ray]]s or extreme heat, or chemical (molecules that misplace base pairs or disrupt the helical shape of DNA). Mutagens associated with cancers are often studied to learn about cancer and its prevention.\n\nThere are multiple ways for point mutations to occur.  First, [[ultraviolet light|ultraviolet (UV) light]] and higher-frequency light are capable of ionizing electrons, which in turn can affect DNA. Reactive oxygen molecules with free radicals, which are a byproduct of cellular metabolism, can also be very harmful to DNA.  These reactants can lead to both single-stranded DNA breaks and double-stranded DNA breaks.  Third, bonds in DNA eventually degrade, which creates another problem to keep the integrity of DNA to a high standard.  There can also be replication errors that lead to substitution, insertion, or deletion mutations.\n\n==Categorization==\n\n===Transition/transversion categorization===\n[[File:TsTvMutation.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Transition (genetics)|Transition]]s (Alpha) and transversions (Beta).]]\nIn 1959 [[Ernst Freese]] coined the terms \"transitions\" or \"transversions\" to categorize different types of point mutations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Freese, Ernst |title=The difference between spontaneous and base-analogue induced mutations of phage T4 |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=622\u201333 |date=April 1959 |pmid=16590424 |pmc=222607 |doi=10.1073/pnas.45.4.622|bibcode=1959PNAS...45..622F }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Freese, Ernst | title=The Specific Mutagenic Effect of Base Analogues on Phage T4 | journal=J. Mol. Biol. | year=1959 | pages=87\u2013105 | volume=1 | doi=10.1016/S0022-2836(59)80038-3 | issue=2 }}</ref> Transitions are replacement of a [[purine]] base with another [[purine]] or replacement of a [[pyrimidine]] with another pyrimidine. Transversions are replacement of a purine with a pyrimidine or vice versa. There is a systematic difference in mutation rates for [[transition (genetics)|transition]]s (Alpha) and [[transversion]]s (Beta).  Transition mutations are about ten times more common than transversions.\n\n===Functional categorization===\n[[Nonsense mutations]] include stop-gain and start-loss. Stop-gain is a mutation that results in a premature [[termination codon]] (''a stop was gained''), which signals the end of translation.  This interruption causes the protein to be abnormally shortened. The number of amino acids lost mediates the impact on the protein's functionality and whether it will function whatsoever.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Stop-loss is a mutation in the original termination codon (''a stop was lost''), resulting in abnormal extension of a protein's carboxyl terminus. Start-gain creates an AUG start codon upstream of the original start site. If the new AUG is near the original start site, in-frame within the processed transcript and downstream to a ribosomal binding site, it can be used to initiate translation. The likely effect is additional amino acids added to the amino terminus of the original protein. Frame-shift mutations are also possible in start-gain mutations, but typically do not affect translation of the original protein. Start-loss is a point mutation in a transcript's AUG start codon, resulting in the reduction or elimination of protein production.\n\n[[Missense mutations]] code for a different amino acid.  A missense mutation changes a codon so that a different protein is created, a non-synonymous change.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Conservative mutations result in an amino acid change.  However, the properties of the amino acid remain the same (e.g., hydrophobic, hydrophilic, etc.).  At times, a change to one amino acid in the protein is not detrimental to the organism as a whole.  Most proteins can withstand one or two point mutations before their function changes. Non-conservative mutations result in an amino acid change that has different properties than the [[wild type]].  The protein may lose its function, which can result in a disease in the organism. For example, [[sickle-cell disease]] is caused by a single point mutation (a missense mutation) in the beta-[[hemoglobin]] [[gene]] that converts a GAG [[codon]] into GUG, which encodes the [[amino acid]] [[valine]] rather than [[glutamic acid]]. The protein may also exhibit a \"gain of function\" or become activated, such is the case with the mutation changing a valine to glutamic acid in the BRAF gene; this leads to an activation of the RAF protein which causes unlimited proliferative signalling in cancer cells.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Davies H, Bignell GR, Cox C, etal |title=Mutations of the BRAF gene in human cancer |journal=Nature |volume=417 |issue=6892 |pages=949\u201354 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12068308 |doi=10.1038/nature00766 |url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/121/1/Davis%2CH_2002_pdf.pdf |bibcode=2002Natur.417..949D }}</ref> These are both examples of a non-conservative (missense) mutation.\n\n[[Silent mutation]]s code for the same amino acid (a \"[[synonymous substitution]]\").  A silent mutation does not affect the functioning of the [[protein]]. A single nucleotide can change, but the new codon specifies the same amino acid, resulting in an unmutated protein.  This type of change is called synonymous change since the old and new codon code for the same amino acid.  This is possible because 64 codons specify only 20 amino acids.  Different codons can lead to differential protein expression levels, however.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Single base pair insertions and deletions===\nSometimes the term ''point mutation'' is used to describe [[insertion (genetics)|insertions]] or deletions of a single base pair (which has more of an adverse effect on the synthesized protein due to the nucleotides' still being read in triplets, but in different frames: a mutation called a [[frameshift mutation]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://members.cox.net/amgough/Fanconi-genetics-genetics-primer.htm|title=Genetics Primer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050411182216/http://members.cox.net/amgough/Fanconi-genetics-genetics-primer.htm|archivedate=2005-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==General consequences==\nPoint mutations that occur in non-coding sequences are most often without consequences, although there are exceptions. If the mutated base pair is in the [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] sequence of a gene, then the expression of the gene may change. Also, if the mutation occurs in the splicing site of an [[intron]], then this may interfere with correct splicing of the transcribed [[pre-mRNA]].\n\nBy altering just one amino acid, the entire [[peptide]] may change, thereby changing the entire protein. The new protein is called a [[protein variant]]. If the original protein functions in cellular reproduction then this single point mutation can change the entire process of cellular reproduction for this organism.\n\nPoint [[germline mutation]]s can lead to beneficial as well as harmful traits or diseases. This leads to [[adaptation]]s based on the environment where the organism lives. An advantageous mutation can create an advantage for that organism and lead to the trait's being passed down from generation to generation, improving and benefiting the entire population.  The scientific theory of [[evolution]] is greatly dependent on point mutations in [[cell (biology)|cells]]. The theory explains the diversity and history of living organisms on Earth. In relation to point mutations, it states that beneficial mutations allow the organism to thrive and reproduce, thereby passing its positively affected mutated genes on to the next generation. On the other hand, harmful mutations cause the organism to die or be less likely to reproduce in a phenomenon known as [[natural selection]].\n\nThere are different short-term and long-term effects that can arise from mutations. Smaller ones would be a halting of the cell cycle at numerous points. <!--the way the cell structure is base then the DNA and RNA will function by the codon.-->  This means that a codon coding for the amino acid [[glycine]] may be changed to a stop codon, causing the proteins that should have been produced to be deformed and unable to complete their intended tasks. Because the mutations can affect the DNA and thus the [[chromatin]], it can prohibit mitosis from occurring due to the lack of a complete chromosome.  Problems can also arise during the processes of transcription and replication of DNA.  These all prohibit the cell from reproduction and thus lead to the death of the cell.  Long-term effects can be a permanent changing of a chromosome, which can lead to a mutation.  These mutations can be either beneficial or detrimental.  [[Cancer]] is an example of how they can be detrimental.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hoeijmakers JH |title=Genome maintenance mechanisms for preventing cancer |journal=Nature |volume=411 |issue=6835 |pages=366\u201374 |date=May 2001  |pmid=11357144 |doi=10.1038/35077232 |bibcode=2001Natur.411..366H }}</ref>\n\nOther effects of point mutations, or single nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA, depend on the location of the mutation within the gene.  For example, if the mutation occurs in the region of the gene responsible for coding, the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein may be altered, causing a change in the function, protein localization, stability of the protein or protein complex.  Many methods have been proposed to predict the effects of missense mutations on proteins. Machine learning algorithms train their models to distinguish known disease-associated from neutral mutations whereas other methods do not explicitly train their models but almost all methods exploit the evolutionary conservation assuming that changes at conserved positions tend to be more deleterious. While majority of methods provide a binary classification of effects of mutations into damaging and benign, a new level of annotation is needed to offer an explanation of why and how these mutations damage proteins.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Li|first=Minghui|last2=Goncearenco|first2=Alexander|last3=Panchenko|first3=Anna R.|date=2017|title=Annotating Mutational Effects on Proteins and Protein Interactions: Designing Novel and Revisiting Existing Protocols|volume=1550|pages=235\u2013260|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-6747-6_17|issn=1940-6029|pmc=5388446|pmid=28188534|series=Methods in Molecular Biology|isbn=978-1-4939-6745-2}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, if the mutation occurs in the region of the gene where transcriptional machinery binds to the protein, the mutation can affect the binding of the transcription factors because the short nucleotide sequences recognized by the transcription factors will be altered.  Mutations in this region can affect rate of efficiency of gene transcription, which in turn can alter levels of mRNA and, thus, protein levels in general.\n\nPoint mutations can have several effects on the behavior and reproduction of a protein depending on where the mutation occurs in the amino acid sequence of the protein. If the mutation occurs in the region of the gene that is responsible for coding for the protein, the amino acid may be altered.  This slight change in the sequence of amino acids can cause a change in the function, activation of the protein meaning how it binds with a given enzyme, where the protein will be located within the cell, or the amount of free energy stored within the protein.\n\nIf the mutation occurs in the region of the gene where transcriptional machinery binds to the protein, the mutation can affect the way in which transcription factors bind to the protein.  The mechanisms of transcription bind to a protein through recognition of short nucleotide sequences.  A mutation in this region may alter these sequences and, thus, change the way the transcription factors bind to the protein.  Mutations in this region can affect the efficiency of gene transcription, which controls both the levels of mRNA and overall protein levels.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Shortcut to Personalized Medicine |date=18 June 2008 |publisher=Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/snps-a-shortcut-to-personalized-medicine/2507/}}</ref>\n\n==Specific diseases caused by point mutations==\n\n===Cancer===\nPoint mutations in multiple tumor suppressor proteins cause [[cancer]].

Hermann Fol continued Hertwig's research by testing the effects of injecting several spermatozoa into an egg, and found that the process did not work with more than one spermatozoon.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barbieri |first=Marcello |chapter=The problem of generation |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=cvskkoD7rx0C&pg=PA13 |title=The organic codes: an introduction to semantic biology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-53100-9 |pages=13 }}</ref>\n\nFlemming began his research of cell division starting in 1868.  The study of cells was an increasingly popular topic in this time period.  By 1873, Schneider had already begun to describe the steps of cell division.  Flemming furthered this description in 1874 and 1875 as he explained the steps in more detail.  He also argued with Schneider's findings that the nucleus separated into rod-like structures by suggesting that the nucleus actually separated into threads that in turn separated.  Flemming concluded that cells replicate through cell division, to be more specific mitosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Paweletz N |title=Walther Flemming: pioneer of mitosis research |journal=Nat.

[[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] acknowledged that the structure of DNA did indicate that there is some form of replicating process.  However, there was not a lot of research done on this aspect of DNA until after Watson and Crick.  People considered all possible methods of determining the replication process of DNA, but none were successful until Meselson and Stahl.  Meselson and Stahl introduced a heavy isotope into some DNA and traced its distribution.  Through this experiment, Meselson and Stahl were able to prove that DNA reproduces semi-conservatively.<ref>{{cite book |first=Frederic Lawrence |last=Holmes |chapter= |chapterurl= |title=Meselson, Stahl, and the replication of DNA : a history of \"the most beautiful experiment in biology\" |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-300-08540-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/meselsonstahlrep0000holm |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Missense mRNA]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Point mutation}}\n* {{MeshName|Point+Mutation}}\n\n{{Mutation}}\n\n[[Category:Modification of genetic information]]\n[[Category:Mutation]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Replacement, insertion, or deletion of a single DNA or RNA nucleotide}}\n[[File:Point mutations-en.png    |thumb|350px|Illustration of three types of point mutations to a codon.]]\n[[Image:RNA-codons-aminoacids.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic of a single-stranded RNA molecule illustrating a series of three-base [[codon]]s.

These consequences can range from benign (e.g. synonymous mutations) to catastrophic (e.g. [[frameshift mutations]]), with regard to protein production, composition, and function.\n\n==Causes==\nPoint mutations usually take place during [[DNA replication]]. DNA replication occurs when one double-stranded DNA molecule creates two single strands of DNA, each of which is a template for the creation of the complementary strand. A single point mutation can change the whole DNA sequence. Changing one [[purine]] or [[pyrimidine]] may change the amino acid that the [[nucleotide]]s code for.\n\nPoint mutations may arise from spontaneous [[mutation]]s that occur during [[DNA replication]]. The rate of mutation may be increased by [[mutagen]]s. Mutagens can be physical, such as radiation from [[ultraviolet light|UV rays]], [[X-ray]]s or extreme heat, or chemical (molecules that misplace base pairs or disrupt the helical shape of DNA). Mutagens associated with cancers are often studied to learn about cancer and its prevention.\n\nThere are multiple ways for point mutations to occur.  First, [[ultraviolet light|ultraviolet (UV) light]] and higher-frequency light are capable of ionizing electrons, which in turn can affect DNA. Reactive oxygen molecules with free radicals, which are a byproduct of cellular metabolism, can also be very harmful to DNA.  These reactants can lead to both single-stranded DNA breaks and double-stranded DNA breaks.  Third, bonds in DNA eventually degrade, which creates another problem to keep the integrity of DNA to a high standard.  There can also be replication errors that lead to substitution, insertion, or deletion mutations.\n\n==Categorization==\n\n===Transition/transversion categorization===\n[[File:TsTvMutation.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Transition (genetics)|Transition]]s (Alpha) and transversions (Beta).]]\nIn 1959 [[Ernst Freese]] coined the terms \"transitions\" or \"transversions\" to categorize different types of point mutations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Freese, Ernst |title=The difference between spontaneous and base-analogue induced mutations of phage T4 |journal=Proc.

Transversions are replacement of a purine with a pyrimidine or vice versa. There is a systematic difference in mutation rates for [[transition (genetics)|transition]]s (Alpha) and [[transversion]]s (Beta).  Transition mutations are about ten times more common than transversions.\n\n===Functional categorization===\n[[Nonsense mutations]] include stop-gain and start-loss. Stop-gain is a mutation that results in a premature [[termination codon]] (''a stop was gained''), which signals the end of translation.  This interruption causes the protein to be abnormally shortened. The number of amino acids lost mediates the impact on the protein's functionality and whether it will function whatsoever.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Stop-loss is a mutation in the original termination codon (''a stop was lost''), resulting in abnormal extension of a protein's carboxyl terminus. Start-gain creates an AUG start codon upstream of the original start site. If the new AUG is near the original start site, in-frame within the processed transcript and downstream to a ribosomal binding site, it can be used to initiate translation. The likely effect is additional amino acids added to the amino terminus of the original protein. Frame-shift mutations are also possible in start-gain mutations, but typically do not affect translation of the original protein. Start-loss is a point mutation in a transcript's AUG start codon, resulting in the reduction or elimination of protein production.\n\n[[Missense mutations]] code for a different amino acid.  A missense mutation changes a codon so that a different protein is created, a non-synonymous change.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Conservative mutations result in an amino acid change.  However, the properties of the amino acid remain the same (e.g., hydrophobic, hydrophilic, etc.).  At times, a change to one amino acid in the protein is not detrimental to the organism as a whole.  Most proteins can withstand one or two point mutations before their function changes. Non-conservative mutations result in an amino acid change that has different properties than the [[wild type]].  The protein may lose its function, which can result in a disease in the organism. For example, [[sickle-cell disease]] is caused by a single point mutation (a missense mutation) in the beta-[[hemoglobin]] [[gene]] that converts a GAG [[codon]] into GUG, which encodes the [[amino acid]] [[valine]] rather than [[glutamic acid]]. The protein may also exhibit a \"gain of function\" or become activated, such is the case with the mutation changing a valine to glutamic acid in the BRAF gene; this leads to an activation of the RAF protein which causes unlimited proliferative signalling in cancer cells.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Davies H, Bignell GR, Cox C, etal |title=Mutations of the BRAF gene in human cancer |journal=Nature |volume=417 |issue=6892 |pages=949\u201354 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12068308 |doi=10.1038/nature00766 |url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/121/1/Davis%2CH_2002_pdf.pdf |bibcode=2002Natur.417..949D }}</ref> These are both examples of a non-conservative (missense) mutation.\n\n[[Silent mutation]]s code for the same amino acid (a \"[[synonymous substitution]]\").  A silent mutation does not affect the functioning of the [[protein]]. A single nucleotide can change, but the new codon specifies the same amino acid, resulting in an unmutated protein.  This type of change is called synonymous change since the old and new codon code for the same amino acid.  This is possible because 64 codons specify only 20 amino acids.  Different codons can lead to differential protein expression levels, however.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Single base pair insertions and deletions===\nSometimes the term ''point mutation'' is used to describe [[insertion (genetics)|insertions]] or deletions of a single base pair (which has more of an adverse effect on the synthesized protein due to the nucleotides' still being read in triplets, but in different frames: a mutation called a [[frameshift mutation]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://members.cox.net/amgough/Fanconi-genetics-genetics-primer.htm|title=Genetics Primer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050411182216/http://members.cox.net/amgough/Fanconi-genetics-genetics-primer.htm|archivedate=2005-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==General consequences==\nPoint mutations that occur in non-coding sequences are most often without consequences, although there are exceptions. If the mutated base pair is in the [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] sequence of a gene, then the expression of the gene may change. Also, if the mutation occurs in the splicing site of an [[intron]], then this may interfere with correct splicing of the transcribed [[pre-mRNA]].\n\nBy altering just one amino acid, the entire [[peptide]] may change, thereby changing the entire protein. The new protein is called a [[protein variant]]. If the original protein functions in cellular reproduction then this single point mutation can change the entire process of cellular reproduction for this organism.\n\nPoint [[germline mutation]]s can lead to beneficial as well as harmful traits or diseases. This leads to [[adaptation]]s based on the environment where the organism lives. An advantageous mutation can create an advantage for that organism and lead to the trait's being passed down from generation to generation, improving and benefiting the entire population.  The scientific theory of [[evolution]] is greatly dependent on point mutations in [[cell (biology)|cells]]. The theory explains the diversity and history of living organisms on Earth. In relation to point mutations, it states that beneficial mutations allow the organism to thrive and reproduce, thereby passing its positively affected mutated genes on to the next generation. On the other hand, harmful mutations cause the organism to die or be less likely to reproduce in a phenomenon known as [[natural selection]].\n\nThere are different short-term and long-term effects that can arise from mutations. Smaller ones would be a halting of the cell cycle at numerous points. <!--the way the cell structure is base then the DNA and RNA will function by the codon.-->  This means that a codon coding for the amino acid [[glycine]] may be changed to a stop codon, causing the proteins that should have been produced to be deformed and unable to complete their intended tasks. Because the mutations can affect the DNA and thus the [[chromatin]], it can prohibit mitosis from occurring due to the lack of a complete chromosome.  Problems can also arise during the processes of transcription and replication of DNA.  These all prohibit the cell from reproduction and thus lead to the death of the cell.  Long-term effects can be a permanent changing of a chromosome, which can lead to a mutation.  These mutations can be either beneficial or detrimental.  [[Cancer]] is an example of how they can be detrimental.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hoeijmakers JH |title=Genome maintenance mechanisms for preventing cancer |journal=Nature |volume=411 |issue=6835 |pages=366\u201374 |date=May 2001  |pmid=11357144 |doi=10.1038/35077232 |bibcode=2001Natur.411..366H }}</ref>\n\nOther effects of point mutations, or single nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA, depend on the location of the mutation within the gene.  For example, if the mutation occurs in the region of the gene responsible for coding, the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein may be altered, causing a change in the function, protein localization, stability of the protein or protein complex.  Many methods have been proposed to predict the effects of missense mutations on proteins. Machine learning algorithms train their models to distinguish known disease-associated from neutral mutations whereas other methods do not explicitly train their models but almost all methods exploit the evolutionary conservation assuming that changes at conserved positions tend to be more deleterious. While majority of methods provide a binary classification of effects of mutations into damaging and benign, a new level of annotation is needed to offer an explanation of why and how these mutations damage proteins.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Li|first=Minghui|last2=Goncearenco|first2=Alexander|last3=Panchenko|first3=Anna R.|date=2017|title=Annotating Mutational Effects on Proteins and Protein Interactions: Designing Novel and Revisiting Existing Protocols|volume=1550|pages=235\u2013260|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-6747-6_17|issn=1940-6029|pmc=5388446|pmid=28188534|series=Methods in Molecular Biology|isbn=978-1-4939-6745-2}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, if the mutation occurs in the region of the gene where transcriptional machinery binds to the protein, the mutation can affect the binding of the transcription factors because the short nucleotide sequences recognized by the transcription factors will be altered.  Mutations in this region can affect rate of efficiency of gene transcription, which in turn can alter levels of mRNA and, thus, protein levels in general.\n\nPoint mutations can have several effects on the behavior and reproduction of a protein depending on where the mutation occurs in the amino acid sequence of the protein. If the mutation occurs in the region of the gene that is responsible for coding for the protein, the amino acid may be altered.  This slight change in the sequence of amino acids can cause a change in the function, activation of the protein meaning how it binds with a given enzyme, where the protein will be located within the cell, or the amount of free energy stored within the protein.\n\nIf the mutation occurs in the region of the gene where transcriptional machinery binds to the protein, the mutation can affect the way in which transcription factors bind to the protein.  The mechanisms of transcription bind to a protein through recognition of short nucleotide sequences.  A mutation in this region may alter these sequences and, thus, change the way the transcription factors bind to the protein.  Mutations in this region can affect the efficiency of gene transcription, which controls both the levels of mRNA and overall protein levels.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Shortcut to Personalized Medicine |date=18 June 2008 |publisher=Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/snps-a-shortcut-to-personalized-medicine/2507/}}</ref>\n\n==Specific diseases caused by point mutations==\n\n===Cancer===\nPoint mutations in multiple tumor suppressor proteins cause [[cancer]].

This hypermutation of G-C to A-T in repetitive sequences eliminates functional [[gene product]]s of the sequence (if there were any to begin with). In addition, many of the C-bearing nucleotides become [[Methylation|methylated]], thus decreasing transcription.\n\n===Use in molecular biology===\n\nBecause RIP is so efficient at detecting and mutating repeats, fungal biologists often use it as a tool for [[mutagenesis]]. A second copy of a single-copy [[gene]] is first [[Transformation (genetics)|transformed]] into the [[genome]]. The fungus must then [[mating|mate]] and go through its sexual cycle to activate the RIP machinery. Many different mutations within the duplicated gene are obtained from even a single fertilization event so that inactivated alleles, usually due to [[nonsense mutations]], as well as alleles containing [[missense mutations]] can be obtained.<ref name=\"pmid2150906\">{{cite journal| author=Selker EU| title=Premeiotic instability of repeated sequences in Neurospora crassa. | journal=Annu Rev Genet | year= 1990 | volume= 24 | pages= 579\u2013613 | pmid=2150906 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ge.24.120190.003051 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe cellular reproduction process of [[meiosis]] was discovered by [[Oscar Hertwig]] in 1876.

This discovery proved that one spermatozoon could fertilize an egg, and therefore proved the process of meiosis.  Hermann Fol continued Hertwig's research by testing the effects of injecting several spermatozoa into an egg, and found that the process did not work with more than one spermatozoon.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barbieri |first=Marcello |chapter=The problem of generation |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=cvskkoD7rx0C&pg=PA13 |title=The organic codes: an introduction to semantic biology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-53100-9 |pages=13 }}</ref>\n\nFlemming began his research of cell division starting in 1868.  The study of cells was an increasingly popular topic in this time period.  By 1873, Schneider had already begun to describe the steps of cell division.  Flemming furthered this description in 1874 and 1875 as he explained the steps in more detail.  He also argued with Schneider's findings that the nucleus separated into rod-like structures by suggesting that the nucleus actually separated into threads that in turn separated.

However, there was not a lot of research done on this aspect of DNA until after Watson and Crick.  People considered all possible methods of determining the replication process of DNA, but none were successful until Meselson and Stahl.

''Dakbayan hong {{PH wikidata|name}}''), or simply known as '''{{PH wikidata|name}} City''', is a {{PH wikidata|income_class_ordinal}} [[Cities of the Philippines|highly urbanized city]] and regional center of the [[Caraga Region]], {{PH wikidata|country}}. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nIt served as the former capital of the [[Rajahnate of Butuan]] before 1001 until 1756. The city used to be known during that time as the best in gold and boat manufacturing in the entire Philippine archipelago, having traded with as far as Champa, Ming, Srivijaya, Majapahit, and the Bengali coasts. It is located at the northeastern part of the Agusan Valley, [[Mindanao]], sprawling across the [[Agusan River]]. It is bounded to the north, west and south by [[Agusan del Norte]], to the east by [[Agusan del Sur]] and to the northwest by [[Butuan Bay]].\n\nButuan City was the capital of the province of [[Agusan del Norte]] until 2000, when Republic Act 8811 transferred the capital to [[Cabadbaran City]]. For statistical and geographical purposes, Butuan City is grouped with Agusan del Norte but governed administratively independent from the province while legislatively administered by the province's 1st congressional district.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Butuan\" is believed to have originated from the sour fruit locally called ''[[garcinia morella|batuan]]''. Other [[etymology|etymological]] sources say that it comes from a certain [[Datu]] Buntuan, a chieftain who once ruled over areas of the present-day city.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nAccording to Datu Makalipay, Butuan was named after the wife of Datu Balansag who was the ''tiniente de barangay'' of the area before.\n\n==History==\n\n===Old Butuan===\n{{Main|Rajahnate of Butuan}}\n[[File:Butuan Ivory Seal.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.75|The [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], housed and displayed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]].]]\n\nButuan, during the pre-colonial times, was known as the [[Rajahnate of Butuan]], an [[Indianized kingdom]] known for its [[metallurgy|metallurgic industry]] and sophisticated naval technology. The rajahnate flourished at the 10th and 11th centuries CE, and had an extensive trade network with the [[Champa|Champa civilisation]] and the [[Srivijaya|Srivijaya Empire]].<ref name=\"philippinealmanac.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701082957/http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |archivedate=2012-07-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/2071/ |title=Butuan Archeological Sites |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref>\n\nBy 1001, the rajahnate had established contact with the [[Song dynasty]] of [[China]]. The ''[[History of Song]]'' recorded the appearance of a Butuan mission at the [[Chinese imperial court]], and the rajahnate was described as a small [[Hinduism|Hindu]] country with a [[Theravada Buddhism|Buddhist]] monarchy, which had a regular trade connection with [[Champa]]. The mission, under a king named \"Kiling\", asked for equal status in court protocol with the Champa envoy, but ultimately was denied by the imperial court.<ref>{{cite web|title=Timeline of history |url=http://valoable1.webs.com/timelineofhistory.htm |accessdate=2009-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123061819/http://valoable1.webs.com/timelineofhistory.htm |archivedate=2009-11-23 }}</ref><ref>[[William Henry Scott (historian)|Scott, William]] ''Prehispanic Source Materials: For the Study of Philippine History'', p. 66</ref> However, under the reign of Sri Bata Shaja, the diplomatic equality was eventually granted to the kingdom, and as a result the diplomatic relations of the two nations reached its peak in the [[Yuan dynasty]].<ref>''Song Shi'' Chapter 7 to 8</ref>\n\nEvidence of these trading links are in the discovery of 11 [[balangay]] boats around Ambangan in [[Barangay]] Libertad, which was described as the only concentration of archaeological, ancient, ocean-going boats in [[Southeast Asia]]. Other evidences of the post are the discovery of a village in Libertad that specializes in gold, deformed skulls similar to reports in [[Sulawesi]], and the discovery of many artifacts by locals and [[treasure hunting|treasure hunters]].\n\n===Colonial period===\nOn March 31, 1521, an [[Easter|Easter Sunday]], [[Ferdinand Magellan]] ordered a [[Catholic mass|mass]] to be celebrated. This was officiated by Friar Pedro Valderrama, the [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]] [[chaplain]] of the fleet, the only priest then. Another priest, the French Bernard Calmette (Bernardo Calmeta) had been [[marooning|marooned]] at [[Patagonia]] with Juan de Cartagena for being implicated in the mutiny at [[Puerto San Juli\u00e1n]]. Conducted near the shores of the island, the ''Holy First Mass'' marked the birth of [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines]]. [[Rajah]] Colambu and Siaiu were said to be among the first natives of the soon-to-be [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish colony]] to attend the mass among other Mazaua inhabitants, together with visitors from Butuan who came with the entourage of Colambu, king of Butuan.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nControversy has been generated regarding the holding of the first mass\u2014whether it was held in [[Limasawa]], [[Leyte]] in Masao, Butuan City, in the hidden isle made up of [[barangays]] Pinamanculan and Bancasi inside Butuan, in the latest discovered site in between [[Agusan del Sur]] and [[Surigao del Sur]], the small barangay of Barobo, or elsewhere. It is sure, however, that Ferdinand Magellan did not drop anchor by the mouth of [[Agusan River]] in 1521 and hold mass to commemorate the event which was held at Mazaua, an island separate from 1521 Butuan which, in the geographical conception of Europeans who wrote about it, was a larger entity than what it is now. [[Antonio Pigafetta]] who wrote an eyewitness account of [[Magellan's voyage]] described in text and in map a Butuan that stretched from today's [[Surigao City|Surigao]] up to the top edge of [[Zamboanga del Norte]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe first municipal election in Butuan took place in March 1902 in accordance with Public Law No. 82<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/act82-the-municipal-code.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710013233/http://lawph.com/statutes/act82-the-municipal-code.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-10 |title=A general act for the organization of municipal governments in the Philippine Islands |publisher=LawPH.com |accessdate=2011-04-09 }}</ref> which coincided with the American occupation of the place.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nDuring the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] in [[World War II]], more than half of Butuan, if not all of it, was burned when [[Philippine resistance against Japan#USAFFE and American sponsored guerrillas|local guerrilla forces]] attacked the enemy garrison on 12 March 1943 in the '''Battle of Butuan'''.<ref>Kent Holmes, ''Wendell Fertig and His Guerrilla Forces in the Philippines: Fighting the Japanese Occupation, 1942-1945'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland & Co., 2015), p. 112.</ref><ref name=Keats>Keats, J., 1963, They Fought Alone, New York:J.B.

On October 20, 1948, still recovering from the war, the entire municipality was ruined by a fire.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Modern era===\nBy the late 1940s to the 1970s, Butuan's industry specialized in [[timber]], earning it the nickname \"Timber City of the South\". The plentiful trees of the area invited many investors to the city, and inspired then-[[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Congressman]] Marcos M. Calo to file a bill elevating Butuan for cityhood. On August 2, 1950, this was passed, converting Butuan into a [[cities of the Philippines|city]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra523-butuan-city-charter.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712043612/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra523-butuan-city-charter.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-12 |title=R.A.

The city's main income by that time frame and until this day depended on small and medium business, and large-scale projects by investors. On February 7, 1995, the city was reclassified from a chartered city to a Highly Urbanized city. Sixteen days later, on February 23, the region of [[Caraga]] was created by virtue of Republic Act 7901, with Butuan as its regional center, and the provincial capital of [[Agusan del Norte]]. In 2000, Republic Act 8811 formally transferred the capital of Agusan del Norte from Butuan to [[Cabadbaran]], however most provincial offices are still located in the city.\n\n==Geography==\n\nButuan City has a land area of {{convert|81662|ha}}, which is roughly 4.1% of the total area of the [[Caraga]] region.\n\nThe existing land use of the city consists of the following uses: agriculture areas (397.23&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), forestland (268&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), grass/shrub/pasture land (61.14&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and other uses (90.242&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). Of the total forestland, 105&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is production forest areas while 167.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is protection forest areas.\n\nThe forestland, as mentioned earlier, comprised both the production and protection forest. The classified forest is further specified as production forest and protection forest. In the production forest industrial tree species are mostly grown in the area. The protection forest on the other hand, is preserved to support and sustain necessary ecological performance. Included in this are the watershed areas in Taguibo, which is the main source of water in the area,\n\nThe city is endowed with swamplands near its coastal area. These swamp areas are interconnected with the waterways joined by the Agusan River. Most of the swamplands are actually mangroves that served as habitat to different marine species.\n\nFilling material needs of the city are extracted usually from the riverbank of Taguibo River. Others are sourced out from promontories with special features and for special purpose.\n\nThe fishing ground of Butuan is the Butuan Bay of which two coastal barangays are located. It extends some two kilometers to the sea and joins the Bohol Sea. These are the barangays of Lumbocan and Masao.\n\n===Climate===\nButuan has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Af'').\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Butuan, Agusan del Norte (1981\u20132010, extremes 1980\u20132012)\n| metric first = Y\n| single line = Y\n| Jan record high C = 35.4\n| Feb record high C = 35.3\n| Mar record high C = 35.8\n| Apr record high C = 37.8\n| May record high C = 37.8\n| Jun record high C = 37.6\n| Jul record high C = 37.7\n| Aug record high C = 36.1\n| Sep record high C = 36.4\n| Oct record high C = 36.3\n| Nov record high C = 35.5\n| Dec record high C = 35.2\n|year record high C = 37.8\n| Jan high C = 30.2\n| Feb high C = 30.8\n| Mar high C = 31.8\n| Apr high C = 33.1\n| May high C = 33.7\n| Jun high C = 33.1\n| Jul high C = 32.6\n| Aug high C = 32.9\n| Sep high C = 32.9\n| Oct high C = 32.4\n| Nov high C = 31.7\n| Dec high C = 30.8\n| year high C = 32.2\n| Jan mean C = 26.3\n| Feb mean C = 26.6\n| Mar mean C = 27.3\n| Apr mean C = 28.3\n| May mean C = 28.9\n| Jun mean C = 28.5\n| Jul mean C = 28.2\n| Aug mean C = 28.4\n| Sep mean C = 28.3\n| Oct mean C = 28.0\n| Nov mean C = 27.5\n| Dec mean C = 26.9\n| year mean C = 27.8\n| Jan low C = 22.5\n| Feb low C = 22.5\n| Mar low C = 22.8\n| Apr low C = 23.5\n| May low C = 24.2\n| Jun low C = 24.0\n| Jul low C = 23.7\n| Aug low C = 23.9\n| Sep low C = 23.7\n| Oct low C = 23.6\n| Nov low C = 23.4\n| Dec low C = 22.9\n| year low C = 23.4\n| Jan record low C = 18.3\n| Feb record low C = 17.5\n| Mar record low C = 18.5\n| Apr record low C = 20.0\n| May record low C = 18.0\n| Jun record low C = 18.5\n| Jul record low C = 17.5\n| Aug record low C = 19.0\n| Sep record low C = 19.0\n| Oct record low C = 20.0\n| Nov record low C = 18.5\n| Dec record low C = 18.5\n|year record low C = 17.5\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 318.0\n| Feb rain mm = 225.0\n| Mar rain mm = 145.4\n| Apr rain mm = 109.7\n| May rain mm = 115.5\n| Jun rain mm = 154.0\n| Jul rain mm = 143.9\n| Aug rain mm = 105.6\n| Sep rain mm = 126.3\n| Oct rain mm = 178.4\n| Nov rain mm = 197.9\n| Dec rain mm = 238.2\n|year rain mm = 2057.8\n| unit rain days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan rain days = 21\n| Feb rain days = 16\n| Mar rain days = 16\n| Apr rain days = 13\n| May rain days = 14\n| Jun rain days = 17\n| Jul rain days = 16\n| Aug rain days = 13\n| Sep rain days = 14\n| Oct rain days = 16\n| Nov rain days = 18\n| Dec rain days = 20\n|year rain days = 194\n| Jan humidity = 88\n| Feb humidity = 85\n| Mar humidity = 84\n| Apr humidity = 82\n| May humidity = 82\n| Jun humidity = 83\n| Jul humidity = 84\n| Aug humidity = 82\n| Sep humidity = 82\n| Oct humidity = 84\n| Nov humidity = 86\n| Dec humidity = 88\n| year humidity = 84\n| source 1 = [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|PAGASA]]<ref name=PAGASAnormals>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181008043243/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasanormvalbutuanagdelnorte1981-2010.csv\n| archivedate = 8 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-normal-values/resource/df060d16-4cae-4180-b14a-e18b23f55ec7\n| title = Butuan, Agusan del Norte Climatological Normal Values\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 8 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=PAGASAextremes>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181008043321/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasaclimextrbutagusdelnorte.csv\n| archivedate = 8 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-extremes/resource/f5fb5f53-c75f-4880-83d9-23d2bced4c54\n| title = Butuan, Agusan del Norte Climatological Extremes\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 8 October 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Barangays===\nButuan is subdivided into 86 [[barangay]]s and group into 13 districts.<ref>Butuan City District and Barangays [http://butuan.gov.ph/page/district-and-barangayl \"Butuan City District and Barangays\"]</ref> Also, barangays 1 thru 26 form the [[Poblacion]] (city proper) of Butuan City.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;background-color:white;text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:top;\" \n!

It is customary for any traveler to learn a little bit of history concerning the place that will be visited, and the history of Butuan City is one of the most fascinating. Unlike other lands whose development only began during the Spanish colonization, Butuan was already a progressive and full fledge city centuries before the arrival of the Spaniards. Historical records show that as early as the 10th century, the local people were already engaged in trade and commerce with other nations and cultures, like the Champa (now Vietnam) and the Srivajaya peoples of Java, Indonesia. This is confirmed by the unearthing of several artifacts such as boats used for plying their trade. During the Spanish and American occupation, Butuan continued to make progress and the number of people who were settling increased steadily. A large number of its inhabitants were converted to Christianity, and in fact one of the issues is whether the first mass was actually held in the city.\n\n==Festivities and annual celebrations==\n{{Travel guide|1=section|date=June 2016}}\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | width1 = 237\n | image1 = Robinsons Place Butuan Main Facade, Kahimunan Festival 2018 (Original Work).jpg\n | alt1 = \n | width2 = 200\n | image2 = Kahimunan Festival Contingent.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | footer = Contingents from Mati NHS (Left) and a Festival Queen (Right) during Kahimunan Festival\n}}\n;Kahimunan Festival:The Kahimunan Festival<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.driftstories.com/kahimunan-festival-2019-experience/|title=A Gathering Under The Rain: Kahimunan Festival 2019|last=Kikoy|first=Herbert|date=2019-01-26|website=Drift Stories|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> is celebrated every third Sunday of January in celebration of the city patron [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Sr. Santo Ni\u00f1o]].

The city used to be known during that time as the best in gold and boat manufacturing in the entire Philippine archipelago, having traded with as far as Champa, Ming, Srivijaya, Majapahit, and the Bengali coasts. It is located at the northeastern part of the Agusan Valley, [[Mindanao]], sprawling across the [[Agusan River]].

The rajahnate flourished at the 10th and 11th centuries CE, and had an extensive trade network with the [[Champa|Champa civilisation]] and the [[Srivijaya|Srivijaya Empire]].<ref name=\"philippinealmanac.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701082957/http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |archivedate=2012-07-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/2071/ |title=Butuan Archeological Sites |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref>\n\nBy 1001, the rajahnate had established contact with the [[Song dynasty]] of [[China]]. The ''[[History of Song]]'' recorded the appearance of a Butuan mission at the [[Chinese imperial court]], and the rajahnate was described as a small [[Hinduism|Hindu]] country with a [[Theravada Buddhism|Buddhist]] monarchy, which had a regular trade connection with [[Champa]]. The mission, under a king named \"Kiling\", asked for equal status in court protocol with the Champa envoy, but ultimately was denied by the imperial court.<ref>{{cite web|title=Timeline of history |url=http://valoable1.webs.com/timelineofhistory.htm |accessdate=2009-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123061819/http://valoable1.webs.com/timelineofhistory.htm |archivedate=2009-11-23 }}</ref><ref>[[William Henry Scott (historian)|Scott, William]] ''Prehispanic Source Materials: For the Study of Philippine History'', p. 66</ref> However, under the reign of Sri Bata Shaja, the diplomatic equality was eventually granted to the kingdom, and as a result the diplomatic relations of the two nations reached its peak in the [[Yuan dynasty]].<ref>''Song Shi'' Chapter 7 to 8</ref>\n\nEvidence of these trading links are in the discovery of 11 [[balangay]] boats around Ambangan in [[Barangay]] Libertad, which was described as the only concentration of archaeological, ancient, ocean-going boats in [[Southeast Asia]]. Other evidences of the post are the discovery of a village in Libertad that specializes in gold, deformed skulls similar to reports in [[Sulawesi]], and the discovery of many artifacts by locals and [[treasure hunting|treasure hunters]].\n\n===Colonial period===\nOn March 31, 1521, an [[Easter|Easter Sunday]], [[Ferdinand Magellan]] ordered a [[Catholic mass|mass]] to be celebrated. This was officiated by Friar Pedro Valderrama, the [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]] [[chaplain]] of the fleet, the only priest then. Another priest, the French Bernard Calmette (Bernardo Calmeta) had been [[marooning|marooned]] at [[Patagonia]] with Juan de Cartagena for being implicated in the mutiny at [[Puerto San Juli\u00e1n]]. Conducted near the shores of the island, the ''Holy First Mass'' marked the birth of [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines]]. [[Rajah]] Colambu and Siaiu were said to be among the first natives of the soon-to-be [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish colony]] to attend the mass among other Mazaua inhabitants, together with visitors from Butuan who came with the entourage of Colambu, king of Butuan.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nControversy has been generated regarding the holding of the first mass\u2014whether it was held in [[Limasawa]], [[Leyte]] in Masao, Butuan City, in the hidden isle made up of [[barangays]] Pinamanculan and Bancasi inside Butuan, in the latest discovered site in between [[Agusan del Sur]] and [[Surigao del Sur]], the small barangay of Barobo, or elsewhere. It is sure, however, that Ferdinand Magellan did not drop anchor by the mouth of [[Agusan River]] in 1521 and hold mass to commemorate the event which was held at Mazaua, an island separate from 1521 Butuan which, in the geographical conception of Europeans who wrote about it, was a larger entity than what it is now.

The plentiful trees of the area invited many investors to the city, and inspired then-[[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Congressman]] Marcos M. Calo to file a bill elevating Butuan for cityhood. On August 2, 1950, this was passed, converting Butuan into a [[cities of the Philippines|city]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra523-butuan-city-charter.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712043612/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra523-butuan-city-charter.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-12 |title=R.A.

The city's main income by that time frame and until this day depended on small and medium business, and large-scale projects by investors. On February 7, 1995, the city was reclassified from a chartered city to a Highly Urbanized city. Sixteen days later, on February 23, the region of [[Caraga]] was created by virtue of Republic Act 7901, with Butuan as its regional center, and the provincial capital of [[Agusan del Norte]]. In 2000, Republic Act 8811 formally transferred the capital of Agusan del Norte from Butuan to [[Cabadbaran]], however most provincial offices are still located in the city.\n\n==Geography==\n\nButuan City has a land area of {{convert|81662|ha}}, which is roughly 4.1% of the total area of the [[Caraga]] region.\n\nThe existing land use of the city consists of the following uses: agriculture areas (397.23&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), forestland (268&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), grass/shrub/pasture land (61.14&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and other uses (90.242&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). Of the total forestland, 105&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is production forest areas while 167.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is protection forest areas.\n\nThe forestland, as mentioned earlier, comprised both the production and protection forest. The classified forest is further specified as production forest and protection forest. In the production forest industrial tree species are mostly grown in the area. The protection forest on the other hand, is preserved to support and sustain necessary ecological performance. Included in this are the watershed areas in Taguibo, which is the main source of water in the area,\n\nThe city is endowed with swamplands near its coastal area. These swamp areas are interconnected with the waterways joined by the Agusan River. Most of the swamplands are actually mangroves that served as habitat to different marine species.\n\nFilling material needs of the city are extracted usually from the riverbank of Taguibo River. Others are sourced out from promontories with special features and for special purpose.\n\nThe fishing ground of Butuan is the Butuan Bay of which two coastal barangays are located. It extends some two kilometers to the sea and joins the Bohol Sea. These are the barangays of Lumbocan and Masao.\n\n===Climate===\nButuan has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Af'').\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Butuan, Agusan del Norte (1981\u20132010, extremes 1980\u20132012)\n| metric first = Y\n| single line = Y\n| Jan record high C = 35.4\n| Feb record high C = 35.3\n| Mar record high C = 35.8\n| Apr record high C = 37.8\n| May record high C = 37.8\n| Jun record high C = 37.6\n| Jul record high C = 37.7\n| Aug record high C = 36.1\n| Sep record high C = 36.4\n| Oct record high C = 36.3\n| Nov record high C = 35.5\n| Dec record high C = 35.2\n|year record high C = 37.8\n| Jan high C = 30.2\n| Feb high C = 30.8\n| Mar high C = 31.8\n| Apr high C = 33.1\n| May high C = 33.7\n| Jun high C = 33.1\n| Jul high C = 32.6\n| Aug high C = 32.9\n| Sep high C = 32.9\n| Oct high C = 32.4\n| Nov high C = 31.7\n| Dec high C = 30.8\n| year high C = 32.2\n| Jan mean C = 26.3\n| Feb mean C = 26.6\n| Mar mean C = 27.3\n| Apr mean C = 28.3\n| May mean C = 28.9\n| Jun mean C = 28.5\n| Jul mean C = 28.2\n| Aug mean C = 28.4\n| Sep mean C = 28.3\n| Oct mean C = 28.0\n| Nov mean C = 27.5\n| Dec mean C = 26.9\n| year mean C = 27.8\n| Jan low C = 22.5\n| Feb low C = 22.5\n| Mar low C = 22.8\n| Apr low C = 23.5\n| May low C = 24.2\n| Jun low C = 24.0\n| Jul low C = 23.7\n| Aug low C = 23.9\n| Sep low C = 23.7\n| Oct low C = 23.6\n| Nov low C = 23.4\n| Dec low C = 22.9\n| year low C = 23.4\n| Jan record low C = 18.3\n| Feb record low C = 17.5\n| Mar record low C = 18.5\n| Apr record low C = 20.0\n| May record low C = 18.0\n| Jun record low C = 18.5\n| Jul record low C = 17.5\n| Aug record low C = 19.0\n| Sep record low C = 19.0\n| Oct record low C = 20.0\n| Nov record low C = 18.5\n| Dec record low C = 18.5\n|year record low C = 17.5\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 318.0\n| Feb rain mm = 225.0\n| Mar rain mm = 145.4\n| Apr rain mm = 109.7\n| May rain mm = 115.5\n| Jun rain mm = 154.0\n| Jul rain mm = 143.9\n| Aug rain mm = 105.6\n| Sep rain mm = 126.3\n| Oct rain mm = 178.4\n| Nov rain mm = 197.9\n| Dec rain mm = 238.2\n|year rain mm = 2057.8\n| unit rain days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan rain days = 21\n| Feb rain days = 16\n| Mar rain days = 16\n| Apr rain days = 13\n| May rain days = 14\n| Jun rain days = 17\n| Jul rain days = 16\n| Aug rain days = 13\n| Sep rain days = 14\n| Oct rain days = 16\n| Nov rain days = 18\n| Dec rain days = 20\n|year rain days = 194\n| Jan humidity = 88\n| Feb humidity = 85\n| Mar humidity = 84\n| Apr humidity = 82\n| May humidity = 82\n| Jun humidity = 83\n| Jul humidity = 84\n| Aug humidity = 82\n| Sep humidity = 82\n| Oct humidity = 84\n| Nov humidity = 86\n| Dec humidity = 88\n| year humidity = 84\n| source 1 = [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|PAGASA]]<ref name=PAGASAnormals>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181008043243/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasanormvalbutuanagdelnorte1981-2010.csv\n| archivedate = 8 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-normal-values/resource/df060d16-4cae-4180-b14a-e18b23f55ec7\n| title = Butuan, Agusan del Norte Climatological Normal Values\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 8 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=PAGASAextremes>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181008043321/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasaclimextrbutagusdelnorte.csv\n| archivedate = 8 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-extremes/resource/f5fb5f53-c75f-4880-83d9-23d2bced4c54\n| title = Butuan, Agusan del Norte Climatological Extremes\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 8 October 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Barangays===\nButuan is subdivided into 86 [[barangay]]s and group into 13 districts.<ref>Butuan City District and Barangays [http://butuan.gov.ph/page/district-and-barangayl \"Butuan City District and Barangays\"]</ref> Also, barangays 1 thru 26 form the [[Poblacion]] (city proper) of Butuan City.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;background-color:white;text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:top;\" \n!

It is customary for any traveler to learn a little bit of history concerning the place that will be visited, and the history of Butuan City is one of the most fascinating. Unlike other lands whose development only began during the Spanish colonization, Butuan was already a progressive and full fledge city centuries before the arrival of the Spaniards. Historical records show that as early as the 10th century, the local people were already engaged in trade and commerce with other nations and cultures, like the Champa (now Vietnam) and the Srivajaya peoples of Java, Indonesia. This is confirmed by the unearthing of several artifacts such as boats used for plying their trade. During the Spanish and American occupation, Butuan continued to make progress and the number of people who were settling increased steadily. A large number of its inhabitants were converted to Christianity, and in fact one of the issues is whether the first mass was actually held in the city.\n\n==Festivities and annual celebrations==\n{{Travel guide|1=section|date=June 2016}}\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | width1 = 237\n | image1 = Robinsons Place Butuan Main Facade, Kahimunan Festival 2018 (Original Work).jpg\n | alt1 = \n | width2 = 200\n | image2 = Kahimunan Festival Contingent.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | footer = Contingents from Mati NHS (Left) and a Festival Queen (Right) during Kahimunan Festival\n}}\n;Kahimunan Festival:The Kahimunan Festival<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.driftstories.com/kahimunan-festival-2019-experience/|title=A Gathering Under The Rain: Kahimunan Festival 2019|last=Kikoy|first=Herbert|date=2019-01-26|website=Drift Stories|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> is celebrated every third Sunday of January in celebration of the city patron [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Sr. Santo Ni\u00f1o]].

Each year over one million people visit the {{convert|16725|acre|km2|adj=on}} park, yet never realize that many people helped restore the park from prior coal mining and oil and gas drilling practices. Today, the park is an outstanding example of environmental engineering achievement.  During the third great ice advance about 140,000 years ago, a continental glacier dammed area creeks making three glacial lakes. To the north, [[Slippery Rock Creek]] filled giant Lake Edmund. To the southeast, extinct McConnells Run filled tiny Lake Prouty. In the middle, Muddy Creek filled the medium-sized Lake Watts.\n\nBefore the glacier dam. Slippery Rock and Muddy creeks flowed north while extinct McConnells Run flowed south. The glacier dammed Lake Prouty on the edge of the drainage divide. Eventually Lake Pouty spilled over and rushed to the south, carving Slippery Rock Creek Gorge.

Each year over one million people visit the {{convert|16725|acre|km2|adj=on}} park, yet never realize that many people helped restore the park from prior coal mining and oil and gas drilling practices. Today, the park is an outstanding example of environmental engineering achievement.  During the third great ice advance about 140,000 years ago, a continental glacier dammed area creeks making three glacial lakes. To the north, [[Slippery Rock Creek]] filled giant Lake Edmund. To the southeast, extinct McConnells Run filled tiny Lake Prouty. In the middle, Muddy Creek filled the medium-sized Lake Watts.\n\nBefore the glacier dam. Slippery Rock and Muddy creeks flowed north while extinct McConnells Run flowed south. The glacier dammed Lake Prouty on the edge of the drainage divide. Eventually Lake Pouty spilled over and rushed to the south, carving Slippery Rock Creek Gorge. Lakes Watts and Edmund drained into the gorge, digging it deeper and making Slippery Rock and Muddy creeks flow south. Areas of the {{convert|400|ft|m|adj=on}} deep Slippery Rock Gorge may be seen at nearby [[McConnells Mill State Park]].\n\nThe glacier created a landscape of rolling hills topped with hardwood trees and swamps in the valley bottoms. Moraines containing gravel, sand and clay were draped upon the landscape and silt was left on the extinct lake bottoms.\nReference to: http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateParks/parks/moraine/moraine_history.aspx\n\n===Trails===\n*[[Butler-Freeport Trail]]- The trail is a [[rail trail]] that connects the city of Butler with the borough of [[Freeport, Pennsylvania|Freeport]].\n*[[North Country Trail]]- The trail passes through [[Jennings Environmental Education Center]] and Moraine State Park, as well as several State Game Lands.\n*Washington's Trail- A regional scenic byway road trail that roughly follows the route [[George Washington]] and [[Christopher Gist]] took on the [[Venango Path]] from the [[Point State Park|Forks of the Ohio]] to [[Fort Le Boeuf]] in 1753.\n*There is also a trail in Slippery Rock Township that connects with [[McConnells Mill State Park]] in Lawrence County.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Airports===\n*[[Butler County Airport]]\n*Butler Farm Show Airport\n*[[Lakehill Airport]]\n\n===Major highways===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|I|76|PATP}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|I|79}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|I|80}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|US|19}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|US|422}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|8}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|28}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|38}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|58}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|68}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|108}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|138}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|173}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|228}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|258}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|268}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|288}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|308}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|356}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|488}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|528}}\n*{{jct|state=PA|PA|588}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Transit===\n* [[Butler Transit Authority]]\n\n==Communities==\n[[File:Map of Butler County Pennsylvania With Municipal and Township Labels.png|right|thumb|200px|Map of Butler County, Pennsylvania with Municipal Labels showing Cities and Boroughs (red), Townships (white), and Census-designated places (blue).]]\n\nUnder Pennsylvania law, there are four types of incorporated municipalities: [[List of cities in Pennsylvania|cities]], [[List of towns and boroughs in Pennsylvania|boroughs]], [[List of townships in Pennsylvania|townships]], and, in at most two cases, [[List of towns and boroughs in Pennsylvania#Towns|towns]].

In 1762, after the [[French and Indian War]], France secretly ceded [[New France]] to [[Spain]], per the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]]. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.\n\nIn 1803, most of the land for [[History of Kansas|modern day Kansas]] was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile [[Louisiana Purchase]] for 2.83 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] per [[acre]]. In 1848, after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] with [[Spain]] brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas. In 1854, the [[Kansas Territory]] was organized, then in 1861 [[Kansas]] became the 34th [[U.S. state]].\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1855, Butler County was founded. It was named in honor of a [[List of United States Senators from South Carolina|U.S. Senator from South Carolina]], [[Andrew Pickens Butler|Andrew Butler]] (1796&ndash;1857), who was one of the authors of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854]] and a strong advocate of Kansas becoming a [[slave state]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_o8X5krq3fP8C | title=Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Embracing Events, Institutions, Industries, Counties, Cities, Towns, Prominent Persons, Etc. | publisher=Standard Publishing Company | author=Blackmar, Frank Wilson | year=1912 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_o8X5krq3fP8C/page/n257 261]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1877, the [[Florence, El Dorado, and Walnut Valley Railroad Company]] built a branch line from [[Florence, Kansas|Florence]] to [[El Dorado, Kansas|El Dorado]], in 1881 it was extended to [[Douglass, Kansas|Douglass]], and later to [[Arkansas City, Kansas|Arkansas City]].<ref name=\"MarionCountyBook\">''Marion County Kansas : Past and Present''; Sondra Van Meter; MB Publishing House; [[LCCN]] 72-92041; 344 pages; 1972.</ref>  The line was leased and operated by the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]].

By 1893, this branch line was incrementally built to [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. This line is called the \"OKT\". The [[Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway]] was foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway]], which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as [[Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad]], merged in 1988 with [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]], and finally merged in 1997 with [[Union Pacific Railroad]].

From the 16th century to 18th century, the [[Kingdom of France]] claimed ownership of large parts of [[North America]]. In 1762, after the [[French and Indian War]], France secretly ceded [[New France]] to [[Spain]], per the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]]. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.\n\nIn 1803, most of the land for [[History of Kansas|modern day Kansas]] was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile [[Louisiana Purchase]] for 2.83 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] per [[acre]]. In 1848, after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] with [[Spain]] brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas. In 1854, the [[Kansas Territory]] was organized, then in 1861 [[Kansas]] became the 34th [[U.S. state]].\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1855, Butler County was founded. It was named in honor of a [[List of United States Senators from South Carolina|U.S. Senator from South Carolina]], [[Andrew Pickens Butler|Andrew Butler]] (1796&ndash;1857), who was one of the authors of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854]] and a strong advocate of Kansas becoming a [[slave state]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_o8X5krq3fP8C | title=Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Embracing Events, Institutions, Industries, Counties, Cities, Towns, Prominent Persons, Etc. | publisher=Standard Publishing Company | author=Blackmar, Frank Wilson | year=1912 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_o8X5krq3fP8C/page/n257 261]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1877, the [[Florence, El Dorado, and Walnut Valley Railroad Company]] built a branch line from [[Florence, Kansas|Florence]] to [[El Dorado, Kansas|El Dorado]], in 1881 it was extended to [[Douglass, Kansas|Douglass]], and later to [[Arkansas City, Kansas|Arkansas City]].<ref name=\"MarionCountyBook\">''Marion County Kansas : Past and Present''; Sondra Van Meter; MB Publishing House; [[LCCN]] 72-92041; 344 pages; 1972.</ref>  The line was leased and operated by the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]].
