He proceeded to join a dance band, where he witnessed an early brass band competition. In 1851 he arranged a contest in [[Kingston upon Hull]], but his first success came in 1853 at [[Manchester]]'s [[Belle Vue Zoological Gardens]], where he helped organise a successful contest of brass bands. He began writing test pieces and in 1860 was approached to run a competition at [[The Crystal Palace]] in London. This event proved highly successful, and ran annually until 1863.\n\nFollowing the Crystal Palace contests, he toured the world with a variety of groups and acts, acting both as a manager and musical director. He then retired to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] to paint and write articles on music, and eventually died on [[Good Friday]], 1903.

While the number of brass bands in the country had increased throughout the 1840s, most of the bands at this first contest did not exist until December 1850: he spent a lot of time encouraging locals to form bands and compete.

The 1860 Crystal Palace event was split into two contests on consecutive days: each had six preliminary rounds held around the grounds, with the finals taking place in the concert pavilion. Winning bands were given trophies, a cash prize of between \u00a35 and \u00a340, sets of music journals, and instruments worth up to \u00a335; the best soloists were also given new instruments.<ref name=HerbertMyers2010/>{{rp|571-2}} Each day finished with a mass concert, performed by almost 1,400 of the contestants: the performance contained Handel's ''[[Messiah Part II#44|Hallelujah Chorus]]'', Mendelssohn's ''[[Wedding March (Mendelssohn)|Wedding March]]'', and Haydn's ''[[The Creation (Haydn)#13|The Heavens Are Telling]]'', ''[[Rule, Britannia!]]'', and ''[[God Save the Queen]]''.<ref name=HerbertMyers2010/>{{rp|577-8}} These performances were conducted by Jackson.<ref name=RussellElliot1936/>{{rp|114}}\n\nIn order to judge the competition, an eighteen-person adjudicating panel was organised with Jackson as the referee. The panel was largely formed of military musical directors, including: Dan and Charles Godfrey (Grenadier Guards), Charles Boos\u00e9 (Royal Horse Guards), Jacob Kappey (Royal Marines), Smyth (Royal Artillery), and Hartman (10th Hussars).<ref name=HerbertMyers2010/>{{rp|582-3}}\n\nJackson's strong sense of organisation and logistics is evident within this event. He had compiled information on each band from their entry forms, including their identity, recent history, musical configuration and style, and the means by which they would travel to [[Sydenham, London|Sydenham]]. On the day before the contest, representatives from each band assembled in the Exeter Hall to be briefed on proceedings and pick lots for the order of play.<ref name=HerbertMyers2010/>{{rp|572}}\n\nThe first day's event was called the National Contest and was open to any band (it was marketed as being for \"Amateur, Yeomanry, or Rifle Corps bands\").

The winners were [[Robert Thompson Crawshay]]'s [[Cyfarthfa Band]] from [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in Wales, who played an arrangement of the overture to [[Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Nabucco]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=LIVSEY, GEORGE FREDERICK (1834-1923) |url=https://biography.wales/article/s10-LIVS-FRE-1834 |website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The band entered both days' contests, as many others seem to have done.<ref name=HerbertMyers2010/>{{rp|577}}\n\nAdmission prices for spectators was a half crown on the first day, with ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]'' estimating that 7,000 people attended.

The 1861 event saw a solo competition for bass players, which was won by a performer from the Keighley band: he was given a [[bombardon|sonorophone E-flat contrabass]] as a prize.<ref name=RussellElliot1936/>{{rp|133}} While most other winners had come from the North, 1863 winner came from [[Blandford]] in [[Dorset]]; the set test piece for that year was a selection from Verdi's opera ''[[La forza del destino]]'' arranged by J.

In September 1871, he began a three-year tour of Australia and New Zealand. He had the opportunity to remain in the country as manager of [[Melbourne]]'s Opera House, but was unable to due to ill health. After his tour, he took over an 1875 tour by the Billingtons, a husband and wife performing in plays together.

{"title_page": "Coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\nThe '''Coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales''' involved the shipping of coal\u2014mainly for local consumption but also for export or coal bunkering\u2014by sea to Sydney from the northern and southern coal fields of [[New South Wales]]. It took place in the 19th and 20th Centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade, which still exists today. There was also an interstate trade, carrying coal and coke to other Australian states that did not have local sources of black coal.\n\nCoal was found to the north and south of Sydney in the last years of the 18th-Century by colonial settlers. Coal seams run under Sydney but at great depth and mining these seams proved impractical. As Sydney grew in size as a city and as a major port, coal was needed for steamships, town gas production and other industrial uses.\n\nSmall ships\u2014colloquially called '[[sixty-miler]]s'\u2014carried coal to Sydney from coal ports that were established on the northern and southern coalfields of New South Wales. The coastal trade was well established by the time Sydney was first linked to the coalfields by railways. Significant customers for coal were situated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta River, and to a lesser extent Botany Bay. Steamships using Sydney loaded bunker coal there.\n\nDuring the heyday of the coastal trade, Sydney was dependent upon a constant supply of coal arriving by sea, particularly for the production of town gas and for bunkering operations. As the uses of coal declined, so did the coastal trade in the last three decades of the 20th-Century. It ended finally, around the turn of the 21st-Century, and is now largely forgotten. Few remnants of the once extensive coastal coal-carrying trade exist today.\n\n== Discovery of coal by colonists in New South Wales ==\nCoal was used as a fuel by the [[Awabakal]] people, the original inhabitants and traditional owners of what is now Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. Their word for coal was \"nikkin\". Evidence of coal use has been found in beach and dune [[middens]], on Lake Macquarie at [[Swansea Heads]] and Ham's Beach, and on the Central Coast at Mooney Beach.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalandcommunity.com/coal-and-the-aboriginal-people.php|title=The use of coal by Aboriginal people|website=www.coalandcommunity.com|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nA group of escaped convicts led by a married couple [[William Bryant (convict)|William]] and [[Mary Bryant]] were the first Europeans to find and use Australian coal, at the end of March 1791. They found \u2018fine burning coal\u2019 near a \u2018little creek\u2019 with [[Livistona australis|cabbage tree palms]] \u2018about 2 degrees\u2019 north of Sydney, 'after two days sailing'.

William Bryant also wrote an account that is now lost but [[William Bligh]]\u2014later a governor of New South Wales\u2014saw it, when he visited Kupang in 1792. Bligh made a summary of Bryant's account in his log and quoted him as saying, \"Walking along shore towards the entrance of the Creek we found several large pieces of Coal\u2014seeing so many pieces we thought it was not unlikely to find a Mine, and searching about a little, we found a place where we picked up with an Ax as good Coals as any in England\u2014took some to the fire and they burned exceedingly well\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1558725/1/Memorandoms-by-James-Martin.pdf|title=Memorandoms by James Martin - An astonishing escape from early New South Wales|last=Causer|first=Tim|publisher=UCL Press|year=2017|isbn=9781911576815|location=|pages=24, 25, 82, 83, 130, 131}}</ref>  It is likely that the location was near the entrance to [[Glenrock Lagoon#History|Glenrock Lagoon]], where coal is exposed in the sea cliff and which was later the site of the Burwood Colliery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geomaps.com.au/scripts/glenrockstate.php|title=Glenrock State Recreation Area - Mining heritage and Dudley Beach fossilised forest|website=www.geomaps.com.au|access-date=19 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nSurvivors of the wreck of the [[Sydney Cove (1796 ship)|''Sydney Cove'']] reported seeing coal south of Sydney, after completing their 700&nbsp;km trek along the coast in May 1797.

That proved true; an immense coal resource existed in New South Wales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://d28rz98at9flks.cloudfront.net/9178/Rec1953_111.pdf|title=The Coal Resources of New South Wales (Draft)|last=Burton|first=G.M.|date=1953|publisher=Department of National Development, Bureau of Mineral Resources Geology and Geophysics.}}</ref>  Coal is still being mined within the [[Sydney Basin]] more than two centuries later. Some individual mines had been worked for well over a century. Indeed, it is only the more recent increased rate of extraction\u2014for the export market\u2014that will see the exhaustion of commercially viable reserves around the middle of the 21st-Century.\n\n== Reasons for the trade ==\n=== Coal for Sydney ===\nCoal was needed in Sydney to feed the [[Gasworks|production of town gas]] (from 1841 to 1971), as bunker coal for steamships, and as fuel for industrial and hospital heating boilers. Brickworks were a significant user of coal as a fuel. In the C19th and very early C20th, there was also some demand for coal as a fuel for domestic heating. Some coal also was trans-shipped and exported from Sydney.\n\nCoal seams extend under Sydney but the huge depth of these seams has resulted in only [[Balmain Colliery|very limited mining activity in Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/109307/balmains-own-coal-mine.pdf|title=Balmain's own coal mine|last=NSW Dept of Primary Industry|first=Primefacts|date=February 2007}}</ref> The coal seams of the [[Sydney Basin]] outcrop to the north, south and west of Sydney. The Metropolitan Colliery, 45&nbsp;km south of Sydney at [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]], is the closest commercially viable coal mine.\n\nGiven the short distances involved, it is not immediately obvious why coal would be carried to Sydney by sea. Not all coal consumed in Sydney arrived by ship; the railways also carried coal to Sydney. However, the main railway lines from Sydney to the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|north]] and [[South Coast Line|south]] were not completed until the late 1880s. By that time, some mines were already well established and connected to nearby ports by local rail lines, the shipping trade was well established, and many major customers already had facilities on the waterfront of the natural port of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and were without a rail siding. Some mines had been designed to ship coal by sea only, for example [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]] (up to 1910) and the [[Wallarah Colliery]] at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. Most of the local rail lines to the mines were privately owned and used rolling stock that was not to the standards expected of main line rail operations\u2014for example wagons without air brakes\u2014and operation over government-owned lines was restricted to specific lines and not allowed on others.\n\nCoal bunkering of steamships in Sydney Harbour was a natural fit for the coastal coal trade. Sixty-milers could moor alongside a steamship and directly transfer coal to the ship's bunkers.<ref name=\":14\" /> After 1920, coal could be off-loaded at the purpose-built bunkering facility, the Ball's Head Coal Loader.<ref name=\":9\" /> Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article246109565|title=SONOMA SAILS|date=11 April 1927|work=Daily Telegraph (Sydney, NSW : 1883 - 1930)|access-date=7 March 2019|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Railways]] were large users of coal. But once the railway from Sydney reached the western coal-fields in 1869 and later the other coal fields, they had no need for coal carried in ships.\n\nFour of the electrical power stations in Sydney\u2014[[Bunnerong Power Station|Bunnerong]] on Botany Bay, and [[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]], [[Pyrmont Power Station|Pyrmont]] and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] on Sydney Harbour\u2014were supplied with coal by rail.

The other power station, at Balmain, had no rail siding. It was coal-fired but also raised some steam by incinerating garbage. Its coal was landed from barges at the waterfront until 1965 <ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/balmain_power_station|title=Balmain Power Station {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> and so it seems likely that some or all of the coal for the [[Balmain Power Station]] came by sea.\n\n=== Coal and coke for the other states ===\nIn parallel to the coastal trade to Sydney, there was an interstate coastal trade in coal and coke from the same ports to other Australian states, particularly Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania where black coal was needed for steamship coal bunkering, rail transport and industrial purposes and coke was needed for smelting ores.\n\n== Ships  ==\n[[File:Sixty-miler.jpg|thumb|A \"sixty-miler\" enters Newcastle Harbour in 1923.|alt=|258x258px]]\n\n=== The \u2018sixty-milers\u2019 ===\n{{Main|Sixty-miler}}\n\nCoal was carried to Sydney in ships known as \u2018sixty-milers\u2019. The name refers to the approximate distance by sea\u2014in nautical miles\u2014from the Hunter River to Sydney.\n\nThe heyday of the 'sixty-milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. In 1919, a Royal Commission identified twenty-nine ships engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|title=Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Design, Construction, Management, Equipment, Manning, Leading, Navigation and Running of the Vessels Engaged in the Coastal Coal-carrying Trade in New South Wales and into the Cause or Causes of the Loss of the Colliers Undola, Myola and Tuggerah.|last=Royal Commission|publisher=NSW Government Printer|year=1920|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=1 & 2}}</ref>\n\n=== The Interstate ships ===\nThere was almost no overlap in the ships used in the two coastal coal trades.

Owners of the 'sixty-milers', during this period, most typically were coal-mines (such as Coalcliff Colliery and Wallarah Colliery), or coal-shippers or merchants (such as Scott, Fell and Company, G.S.Yuill & Co. ),<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

Faculty of Education.|isbn=0864180020|location=[Wollongong]|oclc=27593592}}</ref>  The southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Later companies that both owned coal mines and were also coal merchants (such as R.W.Miller and [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith Ltd]]) owned ships and ownership became more concentrated.\n\nIn the later years of the trade, one of the dominant owners was R.W. Miller<ref>{{Citation|last=Atchison|first=John|title=Miller, Robert William (1879\u20131958)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-robert-william-7588|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> and its successor companies. However, due to company takeovers and cross-ownership between R.W. Miller, Howard Smith Limited and Coal and Allied Industries, it is somewhat difficult to track ownership of vessels and loading assets of these firms. In 1989, [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith]] took full ownership of R.W.Miller. Another dominant owner in the later years of the trade was the Melbourne shipping company [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited|McIlwraith McEachern]], owners of the sixty-milers whose names included 'Bank'  (''Mortlake Bank'', etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flotilla-australia.com/mcmc.htm|title=FLOTILLA AUSTRALIA|website=www.flotilla-australia.com|access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> Ownership was sometimes difficult to follow; the ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter to that company from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]]. Ships of course were bought and sold and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners; sometimes the change in ownership also resulted in the ship's name changing, such as when the ''Corrimal'' became the ''Ayrfield''.\n\nIn contrast to the 'sixty-milers', the owners of the interstate coastal ships were usually more traditional ship-owners, some of whom specialised in carrying coal and coke.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Coal ports & operations ==\n\n=== Northern Coalfields \u2014 Hunter Valley & Lake Macquarie Region ===\nCoal from the northern coalfields was loaded at [[Hexham, New South Wales#Shipping|Hexham]] on the Hunter River, [[Carrington, New South Wales|Carrington]] (The Basin, The Dyke) near [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself, on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]], and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at [[Swansea Heads, New South Wales|Swansea Heads]].\n\nThe coalfields to the north of Sydney had the advantage that the Hunter River and its estuary, while not ideal, could be used as a port. Mining commenced on the northern fields first. The first coal mines were initially operated by the government using convict labour. Sporadic mining operations started around what is now Newcastle and, in 1799, a cargo of coal was shipped to Bengal aboard the ''Hunter''. The first \u2018permanent\u2019 mine at Newcastle was opened in 1804.\n\nWhen Newcastle ceased to be a penal colony in 1821, the government continued to operate the mines. [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] had recommended that the mines be given over to private operation. In 1828, there was an agreement struck between the Secretary of State for colonies and the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] that made [[Australian Agricultural Company#Short-lived coal monopoly & providing land access: disputes with James Mitchell|coal mining a monopoly of that company]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

(Photographer: Ralph Snowball)]]The monopoly was broken when challenged in 1847 by the [[J & A Brown|Brown family]], who began mining coal at Maitland and using the river port of Morpeth and undercut the price of coal mined by the AAC. Coal was accessible in many places throughout the Hunter Valley and on both the eastern and western shores of Lake Macquarie. Once the monopoly was broken, many mines were soon in operation throughout the northern coalfields.\n\nAt the end of the C19th, the four most important companies on the northern field were the [[Australian Agricultural Company]], [[J & A Brown]], Newcastle Wallsend and Scottish Australian ([[Lambton, New South Wales#Colliery|Lambton Colliery]]). Of these, only the Scottish Australian was not a member of the Associated Northern Collieries. This was essentially a cartel that divided production as quotas for each of the participating colliery owners. There was a monetary mechanism under which collieries selling above their quota compensated those selling under their quota. To avoid companies just leaving coal in the ground, quotas were adjusted based on actual sales for the previous year. The arrangement was known as \"the Vend\" and operated for most of the years between 1872 and 1893, when it collapsed due to competition in the export market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

Other names referenced the coal seam being mined and that confused the locality and identity of the mine further. With changes of ownership, mine names often changed and sometimes names associated with good-quality coal were moved to completely different collieries.\n\nMost mines of the northern coalfields were connected to the ports at Hexham and Carrington by an extensive network of railway lines; some were [[New South Wales Government Railways|government lines]] and others were privately owned. Coal was loaded into four-wheel wagons owned by the mining companies. The type of four-wheel wagon used consisted of a frame with wheels and a removable wooden hopper. Trains of wagons were hauled to the port, where the removable hoppers were lifted out of the frame by a crane and dumped by opening the bottom of the hopper. They were known as 'non-air' wagons because they did not have air-brakes.\n\nAt their peak, there were 13,000 of these \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons in service, belonging to around sixty operators. Larger modern bogie wagons were introduced in the 1960s and \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons were banned from Port Waratah in 1974 but continued to be used to bring coal to Hexham.

Sailing ships using the old port of Newcastle tipped [[Ballast#History|stone ballast]] in the area and, with other reclamation work, the line of The Dyke was created by 1861. The Dyke had the effect of constraining the channel of the Hunter River, so that the natural flow and tidal movement of the river tended to scour sediments from the river floor and maintain a deep-water port. Land was reclaimed behind the original Dyke, which became the large rail-yard for the port. Coal was loaded at The Dyke from 1878.\n\nThe Basin is an artificial harbour, to the west of The Dyke, which opens into the junction of Throsby Creek and the Hunter River. It was created by dredging and completed in 1888. The Basin was also used to load coal.\n\nThe Carrington coal-loaders used twelve hydraulic cranes powered by water under pressure supplied from a [[Carrington Pump House|pumphouse]] nearby. There were also three steam cranes. In 1890, this government-operated facility was capable of loading a total of 12,000 tons per day. There were also some privately operated chutes capable of another 3,000 tons per day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Coal Mines of Newcastle, NSW - Their Rise and Progress|last=Kingswell|first=George H.|publisher=|year=1890|isbn=|location=https://downloads.newcastle.edu.au/library/cultural%20collections/pdf/The_coal_mines_of_Newcastle_NSW_their_rise_and_progress.pdf|pages=4}}</ref> Later some electrically operated cranes were added.

Coal in the southern coalfields was generally more easily won than in the northern field. The coal outcropped in sea cliffs or part way up the [[Illawarra escarpment|Illawarra Escarpment]] and adit mining was feasible. [[Adit]]s were less costly to construct and operate than the shafts and sloping drifts of the northern coalfields. The southern coalfields could be worked profitably, if the problem of shipping could be solved. The absence of a suitable port held back development of the southern mines, until around 1849 when the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] mine opened.\n\nCoal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at [[Wollongong Harbour Precinct|Wollongong Harbour]] and [[Port Kembla (seaport)#History of the Port|Port Kembla]] and at the ocean jetty ports: [[Bellambi, New South Wales|Bellambi]]; [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]]; Hicks Point at [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]]; and [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Sandon Point, Bulli]].

At Wollongong Harbour only, some loading was done by crane using wagons with removable hoppers, similar in concept to the ones used in the northern coalfields.

The number of mines was also less and the mines tended to have longer lives.\n\nMost of the southern coalfield mines were members of the Southern Coal Owners' Agency, which had as one of its aims 'prevention of ruinous competition'. It was a cartel-like organisation, controlling production volume, prices, and transport costs, but only for the southern coalfields. It lasted from 1893 to 1950, being renewed every few years by agreement. Although the collieries that were members owned 'sixty-miler' ships, those ships were chartered by the Agency. The Agency managed the operations of the ships and paid the owner a monthly fee based on each ship's capacity. Although the operation of the ships may not have been profitable, the colleries seem to have seen controlling the shipping of their coal as important to ensure reliable delivery, and as a necessary cost. Collieries received an initial low payment upon delivery of their coal to a customer but also later received a share of the actual profits from all sales, in proportion to their market share.<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

It took place in the 19th and 20th Centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade, which still exists today. There was also an interstate trade, carrying coal and coke to other Australian states that did not have local sources of black coal.\n\nCoal was found to the north and south of Sydney in the last years of the 18th-Century by colonial settlers. Coal seams run under Sydney but at great depth and mining these seams proved impractical. As Sydney grew in size as a city and as a major port, coal was needed for steamships, town gas production and other industrial uses.\n\nSmall ships\u2014colloquially called '[[sixty-miler]]s'\u2014carried coal to Sydney from coal ports that were established on the northern and southern coalfields of New South Wales. The coastal trade was well established by the time Sydney was first linked to the coalfields by railways. Significant customers for coal were situated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta River, and to a lesser extent Botany Bay. Steamships using Sydney loaded bunker coal there.\n\nDuring the heyday of the coastal trade, Sydney was dependent upon a constant supply of coal arriving by sea, particularly for the production of town gas and for bunkering operations. As the uses of coal declined, so did the coastal trade in the last three decades of the 20th-Century. It ended finally, around the turn of the 21st-Century, and is now largely forgotten. Few remnants of the once extensive coastal coal-carrying trade exist today.\n\n== Discovery of coal by colonists in New South Wales ==\nCoal was used as a fuel by the [[Awabakal]] people, the original inhabitants and traditional owners of what is now Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. Their word for coal was \"nikkin\". Evidence of coal use has been found in beach and dune [[middens]], on Lake Macquarie at [[Swansea Heads]] and Ham's Beach, and on the Central Coast at Mooney Beach.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalandcommunity.com/coal-and-the-aboriginal-people.php|title=The use of coal by Aboriginal people|website=www.coalandcommunity.com|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nA group of escaped convicts led by a married couple [[William Bryant (convict)|William]] and [[Mary Bryant]] were the first Europeans to find and use Australian coal, at the end of March 1791.

Some coal also was trans-shipped and exported from Sydney.\n\nCoal seams extend under Sydney but the huge depth of these seams has resulted in only [[Balmain Colliery|very limited mining activity in Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/109307/balmains-own-coal-mine.pdf|title=Balmain's own coal mine|last=NSW Dept of Primary Industry|first=Primefacts|date=February 2007}}</ref> The coal seams of the [[Sydney Basin]] outcrop to the north, south and west of Sydney. The Metropolitan Colliery, 45&nbsp;km south of Sydney at [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]], is the closest commercially viable coal mine.\n\nGiven the short distances involved, it is not immediately obvious why coal would be carried to Sydney by sea. Not all coal consumed in Sydney arrived by ship; the railways also carried coal to Sydney. However, the main railway lines from Sydney to the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|north]] and [[South Coast Line|south]] were not completed until the late 1880s. By that time, some mines were already well established and connected to nearby ports by local rail lines, the shipping trade was well established, and many major customers already had facilities on the waterfront of the natural port of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and were without a rail siding. Some mines had been designed to ship coal by sea only, for example [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]] (up to 1910) and the [[Wallarah Colliery]] at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. Most of the local rail lines to the mines were privately owned and used rolling stock that was not to the standards expected of main line rail operations\u2014for example wagons without air brakes\u2014and operation over government-owned lines was restricted to specific lines and not allowed on others.\n\nCoal bunkering of steamships in Sydney Harbour was a natural fit for the coastal coal trade. Sixty-milers could moor alongside a steamship and directly transfer coal to the ship's bunkers.<ref name=\":14\" /> After 1920, coal could be off-loaded at the purpose-built bunkering facility, the Ball's Head Coal Loader.<ref name=\":9\" /> Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article246109565|title=SONOMA SAILS|date=11 April 1927|work=Daily Telegraph (Sydney, NSW : 1883 - 1930)|access-date=7 March 2019|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Railways]] were large users of coal. But once the railway from Sydney reached the western coal-fields in 1869 and later the other coal fields, they had no need for coal carried in ships.\n\nFour of the electrical power stations in Sydney\u2014[[Bunnerong Power Station|Bunnerong]] on Botany Bay, and [[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]], [[Pyrmont Power Station|Pyrmont]] and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] on Sydney Harbour\u2014were supplied with coal by rail. All these power stations were situated close to the waterfront but that was to obtain cooling water not port access.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article146156281|title=THE WONDERS OF BUNNERONG|date=6 April 1932|work=Australian Worker (Sydney, NSW : 1913 - 1950)|access-date=7 August 2018|pages=18}}</ref> Two of the power stations\u2014Ultimo and White Bay\u2014initially were operated by the [[New South Wales Government Railways|railways]] and all the power stations in Sydney were built after the rail connections from the coalfields to Sydney were completed.

Its coal was landed from barges at the waterfront until 1965 <ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/balmain_power_station|title=Balmain Power Station {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> and so it seems likely that some or all of the coal for the [[Balmain Power Station]] came by sea.\n\n=== Coal and coke for the other states ===\nIn parallel to the coastal trade to Sydney, there was an interstate coastal trade in coal and coke from the same ports to other Australian states, particularly Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania where black coal was needed for steamship coal bunkering, rail transport and industrial purposes and coke was needed for smelting ores.\n\n== Ships  ==\n[[File:Sixty-miler.jpg|thumb|A \"sixty-miler\" enters Newcastle Harbour in 1923.|alt=|258x258px]]\n\n=== The \u2018sixty-milers\u2019 ===\n{{Main|Sixty-miler}}\n\nCoal was carried to Sydney in ships known as \u2018sixty-milers\u2019. The name refers to the approximate distance by sea\u2014in nautical miles\u2014from the Hunter River to Sydney.\n\nThe heyday of the 'sixty-milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. In 1919, a Royal Commission identified twenty-nine ships engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|title=Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Design, Construction, Management, Equipment, Manning, Leading, Navigation and Running of the Vessels Engaged in the Coastal Coal-carrying Trade in New South Wales and into the Cause or Causes of the Loss of the Colliers Undola, Myola and Tuggerah.|last=Royal Commission|publisher=NSW Government Printer|year=1920|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=1 & 2}}</ref>\n\n=== The Interstate ships ===\nThere was almost no overlap in the ships used in the two coastal coal trades.

Owners of the 'sixty-milers', during this period, most typically were coal-mines (such as Coalcliff Colliery and Wallarah Colliery), or coal-shippers or merchants (such as Scott, Fell and Company, G.S.Yuill & Co. ),<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

Faculty of Education.|isbn=0864180020|location=[Wollongong]|oclc=27593592}}</ref>  The southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Later companies that both owned coal mines and were also coal merchants (such as R.W.Miller and [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith Ltd]]) owned ships and ownership became more concentrated.\n\nIn the later years of the trade, one of the dominant owners was R.W. Miller<ref>{{Citation|last=Atchison|first=John|title=Miller, Robert William (1879\u20131958)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-robert-william-7588|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> and its successor companies. However, due to company takeovers and cross-ownership between R.W. Miller, Howard Smith Limited and Coal and Allied Industries, it is somewhat difficult to track ownership of vessels and loading assets of these firms. In 1989, [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith]] took full ownership of R.W.Miller. Another dominant owner in the later years of the trade was the Melbourne shipping company [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited|McIlwraith McEachern]], owners of the sixty-milers whose names included 'Bank'  (''Mortlake Bank'', etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flotilla-australia.com/mcmc.htm|title=FLOTILLA AUSTRALIA|website=www.flotilla-australia.com|access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> Ownership was sometimes difficult to follow; the ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter to that company from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]]. Ships of course were bought and sold and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners; sometimes the change in ownership also resulted in the ship's name changing, such as when the ''Corrimal'' became the ''Ayrfield''.\n\nIn contrast to the 'sixty-milers', the owners of the interstate coastal ships were usually more traditional ship-owners, some of whom specialised in carrying coal and coke.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Coal ports & operations ==\n\n=== Northern Coalfields \u2014 Hunter Valley & Lake Macquarie Region ===\nCoal from the northern coalfields was loaded at [[Hexham, New South Wales#Shipping|Hexham]] on the Hunter River, [[Carrington, New South Wales|Carrington]] (The Basin, The Dyke) near [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself, on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]], and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at [[Swansea Heads, New South Wales|Swansea Heads]].\n\nThe coalfields to the north of Sydney had the advantage that the Hunter River and its estuary, while not ideal, could be used as a port. Mining commenced on the northern fields first. The first coal mines were initially operated by the government using convict labour. Sporadic mining operations started around what is now Newcastle and, in 1799, a cargo of coal was shipped to Bengal aboard the ''Hunter''. The first \u2018permanent\u2019 mine at Newcastle was opened in 1804.\n\nWhen Newcastle ceased to be a penal colony in 1821, the government continued to operate the mines. [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] had recommended that the mines be given over to private operation. In 1828, there was an agreement struck between the Secretary of State for colonies and the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] that made [[Australian Agricultural Company#Short-lived coal monopoly & providing land access: disputes with James Mitchell|coal mining a monopoly of that company]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

(Photographer: Ralph Snowball)]]The monopoly was broken when challenged in 1847 by the [[J & A Brown|Brown family]], who began mining coal at Maitland and using the river port of Morpeth and undercut the price of coal mined by the AAC. Coal was accessible in many places throughout the Hunter Valley and on both the eastern and western shores of Lake Macquarie. Once the monopoly was broken, many mines were soon in operation throughout the northern coalfields.\n\nAt the end of the C19th, the four most important companies on the northern field were the [[Australian Agricultural Company]], [[J & A Brown]], Newcastle Wallsend and Scottish Australian ([[Lambton, New South Wales#Colliery|Lambton Colliery]]). Of these, only the Scottish Australian was not a member of the Associated Northern Collieries. This was essentially a cartel that divided production as quotas for each of the participating colliery owners. There was a monetary mechanism under which collieries selling above their quota compensated those selling under their quota. To avoid companies just leaving coal in the ground, quotas were adjusted based on actual sales for the previous year. The arrangement was known as \"the Vend\" and operated for most of the years between 1872 and 1893, when it collapsed due to competition in the export market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

The lugs at the top were used to lift the removable hopper out of the frame by crane.|alt=|260x260px]]\n\nMany collieries on the northern coalfield of NSW were named after collieries in the United Kingdom. Other names referenced the coal seam being mined and that confused the locality and identity of the mine further. With changes of ownership, mine names often changed and sometimes names associated with good-quality coal were moved to completely different collieries.\n\nMost mines of the northern coalfields were connected to the ports at Hexham and Carrington by an extensive network of railway lines; some were [[New South Wales Government Railways|government lines]] and others were privately owned. Coal was loaded into four-wheel wagons owned by the mining companies. The type of four-wheel wagon used consisted of a frame with wheels and a removable wooden hopper. Trains of wagons were hauled to the port, where the removable hoppers were lifted out of the frame by a crane and dumped by opening the bottom of the hopper. They were known as 'non-air' wagons because they did not have air-brakes.\n\nAt their peak, there were 13,000 of these \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons in service, belonging to around sixty operators. Larger modern bogie wagons were introduced in the 1960s and \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons were banned from Port Waratah in 1974 but continued to be used to bring coal to Hexham. There were still 3,000 in use in 1975 and 900 when the [[Richmond Vale railway line|Richmond Vale Railway]] closed in September 1987. 'Non-air' wagons came in different capacities between 7 and 12.5 tons.

Sailing ships using the old port of Newcastle tipped [[Ballast#History|stone ballast]] in the area and, with other reclamation work, the line of The Dyke was created by 1861. The Dyke had the effect of constraining the channel of the Hunter River, so that the natural flow and tidal movement of the river tended to scour sediments from the river floor and maintain a deep-water port. Land was reclaimed behind the original Dyke, which became the large rail-yard for the port. Coal was loaded at The Dyke from 1878.\n\nThe Basin is an artificial harbour, to the west of The Dyke, which opens into the junction of Throsby Creek and the Hunter River. It was created by dredging and completed in 1888. The Basin was also used to load coal.\n\nThe Carrington coal-loaders used twelve hydraulic cranes powered by water under pressure supplied from a [[Carrington Pump House|pumphouse]] nearby.

Coal in the southern coalfields was generally more easily won than in the northern field. The coal outcropped in sea cliffs or part way up the [[Illawarra escarpment|Illawarra Escarpment]] and adit mining was feasible. [[Adit]]s were less costly to construct and operate than the shafts and sloping drifts of the northern coalfields. The southern coalfields could be worked profitably, if the problem of shipping could be solved. The absence of a suitable port held back development of the southern mines, until around 1849 when the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] mine opened.\n\nCoal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at [[Wollongong Harbour Precinct|Wollongong Harbour]] and [[Port Kembla (seaport)#History of the Port|Port Kembla]] and at the ocean jetty ports: [[Bellambi, New South Wales|Bellambi]]; [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]]; Hicks Point at [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]]; and [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Sandon Point, Bulli]].

At Wollongong Harbour only, some loading was done by crane using wagons with removable hoppers, similar in concept to the ones used in the northern coalfields. After 1915, four-wheel bottom dump wagons were used to bring coal to the new No.1 Jetty at Port Kembla, via an unloading rail loop and dump station.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=The History and Development of Port Kembla - Paper prepared for presentation to the Engineering Conference of the Institute of Engineers Australia (30 March 1938).|last=Spooner|first=E.S|publisher=NSW Department of Public Works|year=1938|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=7}}</ref> This bottom-dumping operation was similar in concept to the coal-handling practice of today.\n\nUnlike the northern fields, mines of the southern coalfield were usually named after a locality or geographical feature and their names rarely changed over their lifetime. The number of mines was also less and the mines tended to have longer lives.\n\nMost of the southern coalfield mines were members of the Southern Coal Owners' Agency, which had as one of its aims 'prevention of ruinous competition'. It was a cartel-like organisation, controlling production volume, prices, and transport costs, but only for the southern coalfields. It lasted from 1893 to 1950, being renewed every few years by agreement. Although the collieries that were members owned 'sixty-miler' ships, those ships were chartered by the Agency. The Agency managed the operations of the ships and paid the owner a monthly fee based on each ship's capacity. Although the operation of the ships may not have been profitable, the colleries seem to have seen controlling the shipping of their coal as important to ensure reliable delivery, and as a necessary cost. Collieries received an initial low payment upon delivery of their coal to a customer but also later received a share of the actual profits from all sales, in proportion to their market share.<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

On Belmore Basin, there were four coal staithes on the western side of the basin and two steam cranes on the eastern side. Loading at the 'Tee Wharf' was by a single steam crane. The 'Tee-Wharf' was somewhat exposed to weather from the north and north-east; the existing northern breakwater was not built until 1966-67.\n\nThe port was connected to the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] and [[Mount Pleasant, New South Wales|Mt Pleasant]] Collieries by rail lines operated by the respective collieries.

ICAN brought in $1.4 million in revenue in 2017, with just over $1 million supplied by the Selz Foundation, according to tax filings.}} Founded in 2016 by [[Del Bigtree]], it spreads myths about the risks of vaccines and contributes to [[vaccine hesitancy]],{{R|selz}}{{R|adv}}{{R|rolling}} which has been identified by the [[World Health Organization]] as one of the top ten global health threats of 2019.{{R|v1}}{{R|v2}} \n\n==Funding and activities==\n\nICAN was founded in 2016 by television producer Del Bigtree, after the release of the movie ''[[Vaxxed]]: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe'', which he wrote and produced, with anti-vaccination activist [[Andrew Wakefield]] directing. The national attention Bigtree gained with the movie and its promotion tour allowed the newly-formed group to quickly assume a leading role among the anti-vaccination movement.{{R|selz}}{{R|CWeeks}}{{R|Jez}} Scientists have countered many of ICAN's statements, arguments against vaccination being contradicted by overwhelming [[scientific consensus]] about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.{{R|v3}}{{R|v4}}{{R|v5}}{{R|v6}}\n\nICAN was established with a $100,000 grant from the Selz Foundation. Its budget ballooned to $1.4 million in 2017, with one million coming from the Selz Foundation, making ICAN the most well-funded anti-vaccination group in the United States that year.{{R|NBC}} ICAN pays a salary of $146,000 to Del Bigtree as its CEO and $98,000 to its Chief Administrative Officer Catharine Layton.{{R|selz}} An article in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' states that Layton stumbled upon the anti-vaccine movement on social media after her two sons were diagnosed with autism.{{R|rolling|p=1|q=Layton says her two sons received autism diagnoses after receiving the MMR and pneumonia booster vaccines, respectively; she stumbled on the anti-vaxx community on social media while doing research, and she says that one of her sons has since recovered. }}\n\nIn 2019, Bigtree was a keynote speaker at several anti-vaccination events targeting the ultra-Orthodox Jewish in Brooklyn and in Rockland County.{{R|selz}}{{R|ArsT}} He has been criticized by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum]] for wearing a [[Star of David]] at an anti-vaccination event, attempting to compare the treatment of those opposed to vaccination with the [[Yellow badge|persecution of the Jewish people]].{{R|jta}}{{R|th}}{{R|jos}}{{R|Denton}} Bigtree's anti-vaccine advocacy has been described by anti-vaccination movement critic MD [[David Gorski]] as \"fear mongering based on misinformation\".{{R|Gorski}}\n\n==Access to information lawsuit==\n\nIn 2018, ICAN filed [[Freedom of information]] lawsuits to force the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[National Institutes of Health]] and the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)]] to release administrative reports on childhood vaccine injury HHS is required to file with Congress. HHS replied that that they could not find any such reports.{{R|selz | p=1 | q=In 2018, the organization filed Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services. The suits sought to compel the release of data and documents related to vaccine safety. }}{{R|factcheck | p=1 | q=The claim, Reiss said, stems from a public information request filed by the Informed Consent Action Network seeking administrative reports that HHS had filed with Congress. Though the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires HHS to file such reports, HHS said they couldn&apos;t find any in a search.}}\n\nWhile ICAN claimed the absence of these reports means that the federal government has neglected to properly study the effect of vaccines,{{R|factcheck| p=1 | q=In a July 2018 post on its website, the Informed Consent Action Network says, \"HHS has not acted in its duties regarding vaccine safety, forcing 78 million American children into a vaccine program with no safety provisions.\"}}\nscientists and the fact-checking site [[Politifact]] pointed out a large number of in-depth studies were undertaken and their results shared with the public, even though HHS failed to file the required reports.{{R|factcheck| p=1 | q=However, Reiss said, while HHS said they couldn\u2019t find the reports the Informed Consent Action Network requested, \"that is not to say they have not monitored safety. They have.\" She directed us to two blog posts she wrote about the case. In the first, she notes that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires HHS to report to two congressional committees on its vaccine-related activities. On June 27, 2018, the agency responded to the request by saying that its search for records \"did not locate any records responsive to your request.\" Reiss then details the \"abundant research\" on HHS and vaccine safety, including Institute of Medicine reports that the agency commissions. \"In July 2014, a large report on vaccine safety commissioned by HHS was also completed.\" She concludes by saying that though HHS \"has done and continued to do abundant work related to vaccines safety, the agency should have submitted the required reports.\" }}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref

The national attention Bigtree gained with the movie and its promotion tour allowed the newly-formed group to quickly assume a leading role among the anti-vaccination movement.{{R|selz}}{{R|CWeeks}}{{R|Jez}} Scientists have countered many of ICAN's statements, arguments against vaccination being contradicted by overwhelming [[scientific consensus]] about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.{{R|v3}}{{R|v4}}{{R|v5}}{{R|v6}}\n\nICAN was established with a $100,000 grant from the Selz Foundation.

In the first, she notes that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires HHS to report to two congressional committees on its vaccine-related activities. On June 27, 2018, the agency responded to the request by saying that its search for records \"did not locate any records responsive to your request.\" Reiss then details the \"abundant research\" on HHS and vaccine safety, including Institute of Medicine reports that the agency commissions. \"In July 2014, a large report on vaccine safety commissioned by HHS was also completed.\" She concludes by saying that though HHS \"has done and continued to do abundant work related to vaccines safety, the agency should have submitted the required reports.\" }}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref

Among the confessors, one yielded and, leaving his companions, sought the warm baths near the lake which had been prepared for any who might prove inconstant.  Upon immersion into the cauldron, the one who yielded went into shock and immediately died. One of the guards, Aglaius, was set to keep watch over the martyrs and beheld at this moment a supernatural brilliancy overshadowing them. He at once proclaimed himself a Christian, threw off his garments, and joined the remaining thirty-nine.<ref name=oca>{{cite web|url=https://oca.org/saints/lives/2000/03/09/100727-martyr-acacius-of-the-holy-40-martyrs-of-sebaste|title=Martyr Acacius of the Holy 40 Martyrs of Sebaste|website=oca.org}}</ref> Thus the number of forty remained complete.

Their feast also falls during Great Lent so that the endurance of the martyrs will serve as an example to the faithful to persevere to the end (i.e., throughout the forty days of the fast) in order to attain heavenly reward (participation in [[Easter|Pascha]], the [[Resurrection of Jesus]]).\n\nThere is a pious custom of baking \u201cskylarks\u201d (pastries shaped like skylarks) on this day, because people believed that birds sing at this time to announce the arrival of spring.<ref name=oca/>\n\nA prayer mentioning the Forty Holy Martyrs of Sebaste is also placed in the Orthodox [[Wedding]] Service (referred to as a \"crowning\") to remind the bride and groom that spiritual crowns await them in Heaven also if they remain as faithful to Christ as these saints of long ago.\n\n==== In Orthodox art ====\n[[Image:Relieftafel 40 M\u00e4rtyrer von Sebaste Bodemuseum.jpg|thumb|Ivory relief [[icon]] from [[Constantinople]], 10th century ([[Bode Museum]], [[Berlin]]).]]\n\nByzantine artists were fascinated with the subject that allowed them to graphically show human despair.

Among the confessors, one yielded and, leaving his companions, sought the warm baths near the lake which had been prepared for any who might prove inconstant.  Upon immersion into the cauldron, the one who yielded went into shock and immediately died. One of the guards, Aglaius, was set to keep watch over the martyrs and beheld at this moment a supernatural brilliancy overshadowing them. He at once proclaimed himself a Christian, threw off his garments, and joined the remaining thirty-nine.<ref name=oca>{{cite web|url=https://oca.org/saints/lives/2000/03/09/100727-martyr-acacius-of-the-holy-40-martyrs-of-sebaste|title=Martyr Acacius of the Holy 40 Martyrs of Sebaste|website=oca.org}}</ref> Thus the number of forty remained complete. At daybreak, the stiffened bodies of the confessors, which still showed signs of life, were burned and the ashes cast into a river.

Tomasulo began his study of psychodrama and group therapy in 1980 with Jacquie Siroka and Bob Siroka. He was hired at [[Brookdale Community College]] in 1980 where he won the Master Teacher award and became professor of psychology. He worked there until 2001 and then moved to [[New Jersey City University]] where he developed the first online psychology courses and later the first permanent positive psychology course in the New Jersey state system. In 1998\u201399 he was a teaching fellow at [[Princeton University]] under the mentorship of [[John M. Darley]] in the psychology department and studied with Tony Award-winning playwright [[Christopher Durang]]. He won two international reTHINK Theatre playwriting competitions for his plays on mental health: ''Negatively Oriented Therapy N.O.T.'' (2012) and ''Sticks, Stones and the R Word'' (2010).<ref>[https://www.thebigidea.nz/stories/media-releases/202651-entry-call-for-international-arts-festival International Arts Festival]</ref><ref>[https://www.theatreview.org.nz/reviews/production.php?id=2811 Theatreview.org/reviews]</ref> Both plays premiered in [[Auckland]], New Zealand.\n\nMentored by the author [[Dani Shapiro]], Tomasulo studied creative nonfiction and earned an [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]] from [[The New School]] in 2001. He won the New School MFA Chapbook Competition for his essay \"Kettle of Fish,\" and later studied in the Master of Applied Positive Psychology (M.A.P.P.) at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. In 2012, he became an assistant instructor for [[Martin Seligman]], the Father of Positive Psychology, and James Pawelski, Director of Education and Senior Scholar at the Positive Psychology Center. He was the first psychologist and psychodramatist to graduate from the program and join the teaching staff.\n\nIn 1986, Tomasulo became licensed as a counselling psychologist in New Jersey. In 2005, he and Nancy Razza became the first psychologists to be given the New Jersey Healthcare Providers of the Year award for their work with people with intellectual disabilities. The American Society of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama awarded him the David A. Kipper Scholar's Award for research<ref>[http://www.asgpp.org/pdf/Award%20Recipients.pdf American Society of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama award recipients]</ref> and their Innovators Award for his clinical work in [[psychodrama]] with the developmentally disabled.<ref>[http://www.blatner.com/adam/pdntbk/asgppawards.html American Society of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama award recipients]</ref> During 1992\u20132010, he served as contributing editor of their journal and in 2015 was guest editor for the ''New Jersey Psychologist Special Edition on Positive Psychology''. His most recent book ''American Snake Pit'' was published in 2018. In this memoir, Tomasulo chronicles the first experimental group home for the treatment of mentally ill patients coming from the infamous [[Willowbrook State School]], a hell on earth Senator [[Robert Kennedy]] called a \"snake pit.\" The Willowbrook Consent Decree was designed to protect the constitutional rights of these patients and move them out into the community. Because of the success and the progress made by the in-group homes, mental health became a civil right in the United States and the [[Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act]] was enacted. The screenplay for ''American Snake Pit'' has won 32 awards at international film festivals since June 2017 including first place in Comedy/Drama at the West New York F.A.M.E. Festival,<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/WNYFAME/photos/a.1928160997446065.1073741848.1649550335307134/1928161307446034/?type=3&theater WNY FAME]</ref> and was a finalist in the Art of Brooklyn Film Festival and Hollywood Hills Screenplay Competition.<ref>[https://thehollywoodhillsscreenplaycompetition.com/2017-winners-top-finalists/ Hollywood Hills Screenplay Competition]</ref> His screenplay ''Rock, Paper, Sister'' won first place in the short films category at the Poe Film Festival.<ref>[http://poefilmfestival.com Poe Film Festival]</ref> The short story is about a former heroin addict now an Ivy League music professor who enters a unique form of psychodrama for therapy to deal with a secret he's kept for thirty years.\n\n==Interactive Behavioral Therapy==\n\nInteractive Behavioral Therapy (IBT) is a widely used form of evidence-based [[psychotherapy]] that was specifically developed for people with dual diagnoses,<ref>[http://www.aaiddjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1352/1934-9556-47.4.323?code=aamr-site ''Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities 47''(4) ''Diagnostic Manual\u2013Intellectual Disability: A Textbook of Diagnosis of Mental Disorders in Persons With Intellectual Disability'' book review]</ref> meaning people who are diagnosed with both an [[intellectual disability]] (ID) and a psychological disorder. It uses a modification of theory and technique borrowed from other models in group psychotherapy, and its theoretical foundations and many of its techniques are drawn directly from a form of psychotherapy called [[psychodrama]] that was created by [[Jacob L. Moreno]].<ref>[https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-healing-crowd/201308/positive-interactive-behavioral-therapy-p-ibt ''Psychology Today'' \"Positive Interactive Behavioral Therapy\"]</ref> As people with intellectual disabilities tend to have a difficult time verbalizing their feelings, IBT allows patients to act out particular issues they have while role-playing with others.\n\nIn psychodrama, there are three stages during sessions (warm-up, enactment, and sharing), but those with ID have cognitive limitations, making it difficult to talk about abstract thoughts and feelings that are necessary for therapeutic change.<ref>[http://thenadd.org/modal/bulletins/v3n6a3~.htm ''NADD Bulletin 3''(6) \"The Interactive-Behavioral Model of Group Counseling For People with Mental Retardation and Chronic Psychiatric Illness\"]</ref> In IBT, four stages were developed: orientation, warm-up and sharing, encounter, and affirmation. Each of these stages works toward encouraging patients to communicate effectively while in group settings, particularly those with visual and auditory difficulties, bolsters them with affirmations,<ref>[http://jid.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/10/01/1744629514552153 ''Journal of Intellectual Disabilities'' \"Positive group psychotherapy modified for adults with intellectual disabilities\"]</ref> and improves social skills.<ref>{{cite journal| pmc=3330494 | pmid=9527960 | volume=7 | title=A group cognitive-behavioral and process-oriented approach to treating the social impairment and negative symptoms associated with chronic mental illness | journal=J Psychother Pract Res | pages=167\u201376 | last1 = Daniels | first1 = L}}</ref>\n\nPeople with ID have a higher rate of psychological disorders and, as a result, were often subject to [[diagnostic overshadowing]]. Their mental illness were often overlooked because of their ID or thought that the symptoms were part of the ID itself. But when mental illness was diagnosed, the route of traditional psychotherapy presented a number of obstacles.

He worked there until 2001 and then moved to [[New Jersey City University]] where he developed the first online psychology courses and later the first permanent positive psychology course in the New Jersey state system. In 1998\u201399 he was a teaching fellow at [[Princeton University]] under the mentorship of [[John M.

In 2012, he became an assistant instructor for [[Martin Seligman]], the Father of Positive Psychology, and James Pawelski, Director of Education and Senior Scholar at the Positive Psychology Center. He was the first psychologist and psychodramatist to graduate from the program and join the teaching staff.\n\nIn 1986, Tomasulo became licensed as a counselling psychologist in New Jersey. In 2005, he and Nancy Razza became the first psychologists to be given the New Jersey Healthcare Providers of the Year award for their work with people with intellectual disabilities. The American Society of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama awarded him the David A. Kipper Scholar's Award for research<ref>[http://www.asgpp.org/pdf/Award%20Recipients.pdf American Society of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama award recipients]</ref> and their Innovators Award for his clinical work in [[psychodrama]] with the developmentally disabled.<ref>[http://www.blatner.com/adam/pdntbk/asgppawards.html American Society of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama award recipients]</ref> During 1992\u20132010, he served as contributing editor of their journal and in 2015 was guest editor for the ''New Jersey Psychologist Special Edition on Positive Psychology''.

In this memoir, Tomasulo chronicles the first experimental group home for the treatment of mentally ill patients coming from the infamous [[Willowbrook State School]], a hell on earth Senator [[Robert Kennedy]] called a \"snake pit.\" The Willowbrook Consent Decree was designed to protect the constitutional rights of these patients and move them out into the community. Because of the success and the progress made by the in-group homes, mental health became a civil right in the United States and the [[Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act]] was enacted. The screenplay for ''American Snake Pit'' has won 32 awards at international film festivals since June 2017 including first place in Comedy/Drama at the West New York F.A.M.E. Festival,<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/WNYFAME/photos/a.1928160997446065.1073741848.1649550335307134/1928161307446034/?type=3&theater WNY FAME]</ref> and was a finalist in the Art of Brooklyn Film Festival and Hollywood Hills Screenplay Competition.<ref>[https://thehollywoodhillsscreenplaycompetition.com/2017-winners-top-finalists/ Hollywood Hills Screenplay Competition]</ref> His screenplay ''Rock, Paper, Sister'' won first place in the short films category at the Poe Film Festival.<ref>[http://poefilmfestival.com Poe Film Festival]</ref> The short story is about a former heroin addict now an Ivy League music professor who enters a unique form of psychodrama for therapy to deal with a secret he's kept for thirty years.\n\n==Interactive Behavioral Therapy==\n\nInteractive Behavioral Therapy (IBT) is a widely used form of evidence-based [[psychotherapy]] that was specifically developed for people with dual diagnoses,<ref>[http://www.aaiddjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1352/1934-9556-47.4.323?code=aamr-site ''Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities 47''(4) ''Diagnostic Manual\u2013Intellectual Disability: A Textbook of Diagnosis of Mental Disorders in Persons With Intellectual Disability'' book review]</ref> meaning people who are diagnosed with both an [[intellectual disability]] (ID) and a psychological disorder. It uses a modification of theory and technique borrowed from other models in group psychotherapy, and its theoretical foundations and many of its techniques are drawn directly from a form of psychotherapy called [[psychodrama]] that was created by [[Jacob L. Moreno]].<ref>[https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-healing-crowd/201308/positive-interactive-behavioral-therapy-p-ibt ''Psychology Today'' \"Positive Interactive Behavioral Therapy\"]</ref> As people with intellectual disabilities tend to have a difficult time verbalizing their feelings, IBT allows patients to act out particular issues they have while role-playing with others.\n\nIn psychodrama, there are three stages during sessions (warm-up, enactment, and sharing), but those with ID have cognitive limitations, making it difficult to talk about abstract thoughts and feelings that are necessary for therapeutic change.<ref>[http://thenadd.org/modal/bulletins/v3n6a3~.htm ''NADD Bulletin 3''(6) \"The Interactive-Behavioral Model of Group Counseling For People with Mental Retardation and Chronic Psychiatric Illness\"]</ref> In IBT, four stages were developed: orientation, warm-up and sharing, encounter, and affirmation.

Their mental illness were often overlooked because of their ID or thought that the symptoms were part of the ID itself. But when mental illness was diagnosed, the route of traditional psychotherapy presented a number of obstacles. IBT addresses the unique circumstances of people with ID and mental illness in addition to giving them a sense of belonging and of self-understanding while learning to help others. By working in IBT, the patients with ID can experience an emotional release and learn there is hope as they each work through their issues.<ref>[http://mha.ohio.gov/Portals/0/assets/Initiatives/CentersOfExcellence/201312-dual-diagnosi-white-paper.pdf] Tricia Burke (2013) \"Dual Diagnosis:\nOverview of Therapeutic Approaches for Individuals with Co-Occurring Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities and Mental Illness for Direct Support Staff & Professionals working in the Developmental Disability System\" Ohio Mental Illness/Developmental Disability Coordinating Center of Excellence.

The Axis powers agreed on their opposition to the Allies, but did not completely coordinate their activity.\n\nThe Axis grew out of the diplomatic efforts of Germany, Italy, and Japan to secure their own specific expansionist interests in the mid-1930s. The first step was the treaty signed by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in October 1936. [[Benito Mussolini]] declared on 1 November 1936 that all other European countries would from then on rotate on the Rome\u2013Berlin axis, thus creating the term \"Axis\".<ref name=\"Schmitz\">{{cite book |author=Cornelia Schmitz-Berning |title=Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |page=745 |year=2007 |isbn=978-3-11-019549-1 }}<!--|accessdate=26 March 2015 --></ref><ref name=\"GlobSec\">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/int/axis.htm |title=Axis |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=26 March 2015 }}</ref> The almost simultaneous second step was the signing in November 1936 of the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], an anti-communist treaty between Germany and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Italy joined the Pact in 1937. The \"Rome\u2013Berlin Axis\" became a [[Collective defense|military alliance]] in 1939 under the so-called \"[[Pact of Steel]]\", with the [[Tripartite Pact]] of 1940 leading to the integration of the military aims of Germany, Italy and Japan.\n\nAt its zenith during World War II, the Axis presided over territories that occupied large parts of [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and [[East Asia]]. There were no three-way summit meetings and cooperation and coordination was minimal, with slightly more between Germany and Italy. The war ended in 1945 with the defeat of the Axis powers and the dissolution of their alliance. As in the case of the Allies, membership of the Axis was fluid, with some nations switching sides or changing their degree of military involvement over the course of the war.\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Origins and creation==\n{{Fascism sidebar}}\n{{Main|Tripartite Pact}}\nThe term \"axis\" was first applied to the Italo-German relationship by the Italian prime minister [[Benito Mussolini]] in September 1923, when he wrote in the preface to Roberto Suster's ''Germania Repubblica'' that \"there is no doubt that in this moment the axis of European history passes through Berlin\" (''non v'ha dubbio che in questo momento l'asse della storia europea passa per Berlino'').<ref>Martin-Dietrich Glessgen and G\u00fcnter Holtus, eds., ''Genesi e dimensioni di un vocabolario etimologico'', Lessico Etimologico Italiano: Etymologie und Wortgeschichte des Italienischen (Ludwig Reichert, 1992), p. 63.</ref> At the time, he was seeking an alliance with the [[Weimar Republic]] against [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] in the dispute over the [[Free State of Fiume]].<ref name=Watt>D.

Germany needed access to the territory held by Yugoslavia to allow German forces to have a direct route to travel through, to reach and rescue Italian military forces that were faltering in their campaign in Greece. There was substantial animosity towards the alliance amongst Serbs, Yugoslavia's largest ethnic group, who had fought German Austrians and Germany on the side of the Allies in World War I, and three Serb cabinet ministers resigned their positions in protest after the alliance was signed. Hitler initially attempted to be conciliatory to the Serbs who held animosity to the agreement, saying that he \"understood the feelings\" of those Serbs who opposed the alliance. Amidst the negotiations, Hitler expressed concern to Italian foreign minister Ciano that he sensed trouble coming in Belgrade. A coup d'\u00e9tat occurred in Yugoslavia in which a government rose to power and abandoned its association with the Axis. Hitler accused the coup of being engineered by the British. The coup was at least partly supported by the British though there was substantial patriotic enthusiasm against the Pact with rallies in Belgrade. At the rallies in Belgrade immediately after the coup, people were heard to be shouting \"Better war than pact!\" and waving British, American, and French flags. Days after the coup d'\u00e9tat, Hitler ordered the German General Staff to plan for an invasion of Yugoslavia.<ref>John Lukacs. The Last European War: September 1939 - December 1941.

Hitler in his early years as Nazi leader had claimed that he would be willing to accept friendly relations with Russia on the tactical condition that Russia agree to return to the borders established by the German\u2013Russian peace agreement of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] signed by [[Vladimir Lenin]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]] in 1918 which gave large territories held by Russia to German control in exchange for peace.<ref name=\"Peter D.

The pressure of the reparations on the German economy led to [[Inflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation during the early 1920s]]. In 1923 [[Occupation of the Ruhr|the French occupied the Ruhr region]] when Germany defaulted on its reparations payments. Although Germany began to improve economically in the mid-1920s, the [[Great Depression]] created more economic hardship and a rise in political forces that advocated radical solutions to Germany's woes. The Nazis, under Hitler, promoted the nationalist [[stab-in-the-back legend]] stating that Germany had been betrayed by Jews and Communists. The party promised to rebuild Germany as a major power and create a [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]] that would include [[Alsace-Lorraine]], [[Austria]], [[Sudetenland]], and other German-populated territories in Europe. The Nazis also aimed to occupy and colonize non-German territories in [[Poland]], the [[Baltic states]], and the Soviet Union, as part of the Nazi policy of seeking ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") in eastern Europe.\n\nGermany renounced the Versailles treaty and [[remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized the Rhineland]] in March 1936. Germany had already resumed conscription and announced the existence of a German air force, the [[Luftwaffe]], and naval force, the [[Kriegsmarine]] in 1935. Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria in 1938]], the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Sudetenland]] from Czechoslovakia, and the [[Memel territory]] from [[Lithuania]] in 1939. Germany then invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in 1939, creating the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the country of [[Slovakia]].\n\nOn 23 August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], which contained a secret protocol dividing eastern Europe into spheres of influence.{{sfn|Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} Germany's invasion of its part of Poland under the Pact eight days later{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=82}} triggered the beginning of World War II. By the end of 1941, Germany occupied a large part of Europe and [[Wehrmacht|its military forces]] were fighting the Soviet Union, nearly capturing Moscow. However, crushing defeats at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Battle of Kursk]] devastated the German armed forces. This, combined with Western Allied [[Normandy Landings|landings in France]] and [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Italy]], led to a three-front war that depleted Germany's armed forces and resulted in Germany's defeat in 1945.\n\nThere was substantial internal opposition within the German military to the Nazi regime's aggressive strategy of rearmament and foreign policy in the 1930s.<ref>Command Magagzine. Hitler's Army: The Evolution and Structure of German Forces 1933\u20131945.

Thomsett 1945. P. 41\"/>\n\n====Colonies and dependencies====\n{{further|Areas annexed by Nazi Germany|German-occupied Europe}}\n\nThe [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] was created from the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Shortly after Germany annexed the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, Slovakia declared its independence. The new [[Slovak State]] allied itself with Germany. The remainder of the country was occupied by German military forces and organized into the Protectorate. Czech civil institutions were preserved but the Protectorate was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany.\n\nThe [[General Government]] was the name given to the territories of occupied Poland that were not directly annexed into German provinces, but like Bohemia and Moravia was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany.\n\nBelgium quickly surrendered to Germany, and the Belgian King remained in the country during the German military occupation from 1940 to 1944. The Belgian King cooperated closely with Germany and repeatedly sought assurances that Belgian rights would be retained once Germany achieved total victory. However, Hitler intended to annex Belgium and its Germanic population into the Greater Germanic Reich, initiated by the creation of [[Reichskommissariat Belgien]], an authority run directly by the German government that sought the incorporation of the territory into the planned Germanic Reich. However Belgium was soon occupied by Allied forces in 1944.\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Niederlande]] was an occupation authority and territory established in the Netherlands in 1940 designated as a colony to be incorporated into the planned Greater Germanic Reich.\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]] was established in Norway in 1940. Like the Reichskommissariats in Belgium and the Netherlands, its Germanic peoples were to be incorporated into the Greater Germanic Reich. In Norway, the [[Quisling regime]], headed by [[Vidkun Quisling]], was installed by the Germans as a client regime [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|during the occupation]], while king [[Haakon VII]] and the legal [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|government were in exile]]. Quisling encouraged Norwegians to serve as volunteers [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking|in the Waffen-SS]], collaborated in the deportation of Jews, and was responsible for the executions of members of the [[Norwegian resistance movement]].\n\nAbout 45,000 Norwegian collaborators joined the pro-Nazi party ''[[Nasjonal Samling]]'' (National Union), and some police units helped arrest many Jews. However, Norway was one of the first countries where [[resistance during World War II]] was widespread before the turning point of the war in 1943. After the war, [[Legal purge in Norway after World War II|Quisling and other collaborators were executed]]. Quisling's name has become an international [[eponym]] for [[traitor]].\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Ostland]] was established in the Baltic region in 1941. Unlike the western Reichskommissariats that sought the incorporation of their majority Germanic peoples, Ostland were designed for settlement by Germans who would displace the non-Germanic majority living there, as part of ''lebensraum''.\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]] was established in Ukraine in 1941. Like Ostland it was slated for settlement by Germans.\n\nThe [[Military Administration in Serbia]] was established on occupied [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] territory in April 1941, following the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion of the country]]. On 30 April a pro-German Serbian administration was formed under [[Milan A\u0107imovi\u0107]] to serve as a civil administration in the military occupation zone. A joint [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] and [[Chetnik]] uprising in late 1941 became a serious concern for the Germans, as most of their forces were deployed to Russia; only three divisions were in the country. On 13 August 546 Serbs, including some of the country's prominent and influential leaders, issued an appeal to the Serbian nation that condemned the Partisan and royalist resistance as unpatriotic. Two weeks after the appeal, with the Partisan and royalist insurgency beginning to gain momentum, 75 prominent Serbs convened a meeting in Belgrade and formed a [[Government of National Salvation]] under Serbian General [[Milan Nedi\u0107]] to replace the existing Serbian administration. The Germans were short of police and military forces in Serbia, and came to rely on poorly armed Serbian formations, the [[Serbian State Guard]] and [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]], to maintain order. These forces, however, were not able to contain the resistance, and for the most of the war large parts of Serbia were under control of the Partisans or Chetniks (the two resistance movements soon became mutually-hostile). The Government of National Salvation, imbued with few powers upon formation, saw its functions further decreased and taken over by the [[Wehrmacht]] occupation authorities as the war progressed. After the initial mass revolts, the German authorities instituted an extreme regime of reprisals, proclaiming that 100 civilians would be executed for every German soldier killed, and 50 for each one wounded. These measures were actually implemented on more than one occasion: large-scale shootings took place in the Serbian towns of [[Kraljevo massacre|Kraljevo]] and [[Kragujevac massacre|Kragujevac]] during October 1941.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Italy|Italian Empire|Imperial Italy (fascist)|Latin Bloc (proposed alliance)|Military history of Italy during World War II}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-783-0104-09, Nordafrika, italienische Soldaten auf dem Marsch.jpg|thumb|Italian soldiers in the [[North African Campaign]] in 1941]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-783-0104-38, Nordafrika, italienische Panzer M13-40.jpg|thumb|Italian [[Fiat M13/40]] tanks in the North African Campaign in 1941]]\n[[File:Veneto guns at Gaudos.jpg|thumb|Italian battleship ''[[Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]'' firing at Allied warships during the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016230-0008, Bersaglieri in Jugoslawien.jpg|thumb|Italian ''[[Bersaglieri]]'' in the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]]]]\n[[File:Macchi200 m2.jpg|thumb|Italian [[Macchi C.200]] fighter aircraft during the war]]\n\n====War justifications====\n\n''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] described Italy's declaration of war against the Western Allies of Britain and France in June 1940 as the following: \"We are going to war against the [[Plutocracy|plutocratic]] and [[reactionary]] [[Democracy|democracies]] of the [[Western world|West]] who have invariably hindered the progress and often threatened the very existence of the [[Italians|Italian people]]\".<ref>John Whittam.

There was a desire to annex [[Dalmatia]]n territories, which had formerly been ruled by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], and which consequently had Italian-speaking elites. The intention of the Fascist regime was to create a \"[[Italian Empire|New Roman Empire]]\" in which Italy would dominate the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. In 1935\u20131936 [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italy invaded and annexed Ethiopia]] and the Fascist government proclaimed the creation of the \"Italian Empire\".{{sfn|Lowe|Marzari|2002|p=289}} Protests by the [[League of Nations]], especially the British, who had interests in that area, led to no serious action, although The League did try to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident highlighted French and British weakness, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose her as their ally. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany anyway. In 1937 Italy left the League of Nations and joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which had been signed by Germany and Japan the preceding year. In March/April 1939 Italian troops invaded and annexed [[Albania]]. Germany and Italy signed the [[Pact of Steel]] on May 22.\n\nItaly entered World War II on 10 June 1940. In September 1940 Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]].\n\nItaly was ill-prepared for war, in spite of the fact that it had continuously been involved in conflict since 1935, first with Ethiopia in 1935\u20131936 and then in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the side of [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]].{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=40\u201341}} \nMussolini refused to heed warnings from his minister of exchange and currency, Felice Guarneri, who said that Italy's actions in Ethiopia and Spain meant that Italy was on the verge of bankruptcy.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} By 1939 military expenditures by Britain and France far exceeded what Italy could afford.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} As a result of Italy's economic difficulties its soldiers were poorly paid, often being poorly equipped and poorly supplied, and animosity arose between soldiers and class-conscious officers; these contributed to low morale amongst Italian soldiers.<ref>[[Samuel W.

By March 1940, Mussolini decided that Italy would intervene, but the date was not yet chosen. His senior military leadership unanimously opposed the action because Italy was unprepared. No raw materials had been stockpiled and the reserves it did have would soon be exhausted, Italy's industrial base was only one-tenth of Germany's, and even with supplies the Italian military was not organized to provide the equipment needed to fight a modern war of a long duration. An ambitious rearmament program was impossible because of Italy's limited reserves in gold and foreign currencies and lack of raw materials. Mussolini ignored the negative advice.<ref>Stephen L. W.

As the Japanese home islands lacked natural resources needed for growth, Japan planned to establish hegemony in Asia and become self-sufficient by acquiring territories with abundant natural resources. Japan's expansionist policies alienated it from other countries in the [[League of Nations]] and by the mid-1930s brought it closer to Germany and Italy, who had both pursued similar expansionist policies. Cooperation between Japan and Germany began with the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], in which the two countries agreed to ally to challenge any attack by the Soviet Union.\n\nJapan entered into conflict [[Second Sino-Japanese War|against the Chinese]] in 1937. The Japanese invasion and occupation of parts of China resulted in numerous atrocities against civilians, such as the [[Nanking massacre]] and the [[Three Alls Policy]]. The Japanese also [[Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts|fought skirmishes]] with Soviet\u2013[[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolian]] forces in [[Manchukuo]] in 1938 and 1939. Japan sought to avoid war with the Soviet Union by signing a non-aggression pact with it in 1941.\n\n[[File:Greater Asian Co-prosperity sphere.png|thumb|left|The Empire of Japan (darker red) and territories controlled by Japanese puppet states during the war (lighter red). Thailand (darkest red) cooperated with Japan. All are members of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]].]]\nJapan's military leaders were divided on diplomatic relationships with Germany and Italy and the attitude towards the United States. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] was in favour of war with the United States, but the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] was generally strongly opposed. When [[Prime Minister of Japan]] General [[Hideki Tojo]] refused American demands that Japan withdraw its military forces from China, a confrontation became more likely.{{sfn|Dull|2007|p=5}} War with the United States was being discussed within the Japanese government by 1940.{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275\u2013276}} Commander of the Combined Fleet Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] was outspoken in his opposition, especially after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, saying on 14 October 1940: \"To fight the United States is like fighting the whole world. But it has been decided. So I will fight the best I can. Doubtless I shall die on board {{ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}} [his flagship]. Meanwhile Tokyo will be burnt to the ground three times. Konoe and others will be torn to pieces by the revengeful people, I [shouldn't] wonder. \"{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275\u2013276}} In October and November 1940, Yamamoto communicated with Navy Minister Oikawa, and stated, \"Unlike the pre-Tripartite days, great determination is required to make certain that we avoid the danger of going to war. \"{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275\u2013276}}\n\nWith the European powers focused on the war in Europe, Japan sought to acquire their colonies. In 1940 Japan responded to the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]] by occupying [[French Indochina]]. The [[Vichy France]] regime, a ''de facto'' ally of Germany, accepted the takeover. The allied forces did not respond with war. However, the United States instituted an embargo against Japan in 1941 because of the continuing war in China. This cut off Japan's supply of scrap metal and oil needed for industry, trade, and the war effort.\n\nTo isolate the US forces stationed in the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]] and to reduce US naval power, the [[Imperial General Headquarters]] ordered [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|an attack]] on the US naval base at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, on 7 December 1941. They also invaded [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. Initially achieving a series of victories, by 1943 the Japanese forces were driven back towards the home islands. The [[Pacific War]] lasted until the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945. The Soviets formally declared war in August 1945 and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|engaged Japanese forces]] in Manchuria and northeast China.\n\n====Colonies and dependencies====\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Indonesische jongens tijdens hun soldatentraining door de Japanners TMnr 10001989.jpg|thumb|Japanese officers training Indonesian recruits]]\nTaiwan, then known as Formosa, was a Japanese dependency established in 1895.\n\nKorea was a Japanese protectorate and dependency formally established by the [[Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1910]].\n\nThe [[South Pacific Mandate]] were territories granted to Japan in 1919 in the peace agreements of World War I, that designated to Japan the German South Pacific islands. Japan received these as a reward by the Allies of World War I, when Japan was then allied against Germany.\n\nJapan occupied the [[Dutch East Indies]] during the war. Japan planned to transform these territories into a client state of [[Indonesia]] and sought alliance with Indonesian nationalists including future Indonesian President [[Sukarno]], however these efforts did not deliver the creation of an Indonesian state until after Japan's surrender.<ref>Li Narangoa, R. B. Cribb. ''Imperial Japan and National Identities in Asia, 1895-1945''. Psychology Press, 2003. P15-16.</ref>\n\n==Subsequent signatories of the Tripartite Pact==\nIn addition to the 3 major Axis powers, 4 more countries and 2 puppet regimes signed the Tri-Partite Pact as its member states. Of the 4 countries, Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria participated in various Axis military operations with their national armed forces, while the 4th, Yugoslavia, saw its pro-Nazi government overthrown in a coup merely days after it signed the Pact, and the membership was reversed.\n\nThe 2 puppet regimes that signed the Tri-Partite Pact, Tiso-led Slovakia and the Independent State of Croatia are listed among the client states section below.\n\n===Bulgaria===\n{{Main|Military history of Bulgaria during World War II}}\n[[File:Bulgarian army 1941.jpg|thumb|Bulgarian soldiers in [[Vardar Macedonia]] during the Balkans campaign]]\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] was ruled by [[Boris III of Bulgaria|\u0422sar Boris III]] when it signed the Tripartite Pact on 1 March 1941. Bulgaria had been on the losing side in the First World War and sought a return of lost ethnically and historically Bulgarian territories, specifically in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]] (all within [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]] and [[Turkey]]). During the 1930s, because of traditional right-wing elements, Bulgaria drew closer to Nazi Germany. In 1940 Germany pressured Romania to sign the [[Treaty of Craiova]], returning to Bulgaria the region of [[Southern Dobrudja]], which it had lost in 1913. The Germans also promised Bulgaria \u2014 if it joined the Axis \u2014 an enlargement of its territory to the borders specified in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]].\n\nBulgaria participated in the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] and Greece by letting German troops attack from its territory and sent troops to Greece on April 20. As a reward, the Axis powers allowed Bulgaria to occupy parts of both countries\u2014southern and south-eastern Yugoslavia ([[Vardar Banovina]]) and north-eastern Greece (parts of [[Greek Macedonia]] and [[Greek Thrace]]). The Bulgarian forces in these areas spent the following years fighting various nationalist groups and [[resistance movement]]s. Despite German pressure, Bulgaria did not take part in the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]] and actually never declared war on the Soviet Union. The [[Bulgarian Navy]] was nonetheless involved in a number of skirmishes with the Soviet [[Black Sea Fleet]], which attacked Bulgarian shipping.\n\nFollowing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Bulgarian government declared war on the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. This action remained largely symbolic (at least from the Bulgarian perspective), until August 1943, when Bulgarian air defense and air force attacked Allied bombers, returning (heavily damaged) from a mission over the Romanian oil refineries. This turned into a disaster for the citizens of [[Sofia]] and other major Bulgarian cities, which were heavily bombed by the Allies in the winter of 1943\u20131944.\n\nOn 2 September 1944, as the [[Red Army]] approached the Bulgarian border, a new Bulgarian government came to power and sought peace with the Allies, expelled the few remaining German troops, and declared neutrality. These measures however did not prevent the Soviet Union from declaring war on Bulgaria on 5 September, and on 8 September the Red Army marched into the country, meeting no resistance. This was followed by the [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1944|coup d'\u00e9tat of 9 September 1944]], which brought a government of the pro-Soviet [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]] to power. After this, the Bulgarian army (as part of the Red Army's [[3rd Ukrainian Front]]) fought the Germans in Yugoslavia and Hungary, sustaining numerous casualties. Despite this, the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]] treated Bulgaria as one of the defeated countries. Bulgaria was allowed to keep [[Southern Dobruja]], but had to give up all claims to Greek and Yugoslav territory.\n\n===Hungary===\n{{Main|Hungary during World War II|Government of National Unity (Hungary)}}\n[[File:Toldi.jpg|thumb|Hungarian [[Toldi (tank)|Toldi I]] tank as used during the 1941 Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]][[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], ruled by [[Regent]] Admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]], was the first country apart from Germany, Italy, and Japan to adhere to the Tripartite Pact, signing the agreement on 20 November 1940. Slovakia had been a client state of Germany since 1939.<ref>Seamus Dunn, T.G. Fraser. Europe and Ethnicity: The First World War and Contemporary Ethnic Conflict. Routledge, 1996. P97.</ref>\n\nPolitical instability plagued the country until Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, a Hungarian nobleman and [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian naval]] officer, became regent in 1920. The vast majority of the Hungarians desired to recover territories lost through the [[Trianon Treaty]]. The country drew closer to Germany and Italy largely because of a shared desire to revise the peace settlements made after World War I.{{sfn|Montgomery|2002|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} Many people sympathized with the [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] policy of the Nazi regime. Due to its supportive stance towards Germany and the new efforts in the international policy, Hungary gained favourable territorial settlements by the [[First Vienna Award]], after the breakup of [[Czechoslovakia]] occupied and annexed the remainder of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] and in 1940 received [[Northern Transylvania]] from Romania via the [[Second Vienna Award]]. Hungarians permitted German troops to transit through their territory during the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], and Hungarian forces took part in the invasion. Parts of Yugoslavia were annexed to Hungary; the United Kingdom immediately broke off diplomatic relations in response.\n\nAlthough Hungary did not initially participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], Hungary and the [[Soviet Union]] became belligerents on 27 June 1941. Over 500,000 soldiers served on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. All five of Hungary's field armies ultimately participated in the war against the Soviet Union; a significant contribution was made by the [[Hungarian Second Army]].[[File:Hungarian soldiers in the Carpathians.jpg|thumb|Hungarian soldiers in the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1944]]\n\nOn 25 November 1941, Hungary was one of thirteen signatories to the revived Anti-Comintern Pact. Hungarian troops, like their Axis counterparts, were involved in numerous actions against the Soviets. By the end of 1943, the Soviets had gained the upper hand and the Germans were retreating. The Hungarian Second Army was destroyed in fighting on the [[Voronezh Front]], on the banks of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]]. In 1944, with Soviet troops advancing toward Hungary, Horthy attempted to reach an armistice with the Allies. However, the Germans [[Operation Panzerfaust|replaced the existing regime with a new one]]. After fierce fighting, Budapest was taken by the Soviets. A number of pro-German Hungarians retreated to Italy and Germany, where they fought until the end of the war.\n[[File:Rep\u00fcl\u0151t\u00e9r, 1944. \u00e1prilis 13.

Horthy was forced to abdicate after German commandos, led by Colonel [[Otto Skorzeny]], held his son hostage as part of [[Operation Panzerfaust]].\n\nHungary was reorganized following Horthy's abdication in December 1944 into a totalitarian fascist regime called the [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]], led by [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]]. He had been Prime Minister of Hungary since October 1944 and was leader of the anti-Semitic fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]]. In power, his government was a puppet regime with little authority, and the country was effectively under German control. Days after the Sz\u00e1lasi government took power, the capital of [[Budapest]] was surrounded by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. German and Hungarian fascist forces tried to hold off the Soviet advance but failed. In March 1945, Sz\u00e1lasi fled to Germany as the leader of a government in exile, until the surrender of Germany in May 1945.\n\n===Romania===\n{{Main|Romania in World War II|Romanian Navy during World War II}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B03212, M\u00fcnchen, Staatsbesuch Jon Antonescu bei Hitler.jpg|thumb|Ion Antonescu and [[Adolf Hitler]] at the ''[[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Theater M\u00fcnchen|F\u00fchrerbau]]'' in [[Munich]] (June 1941)]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-218-0501-27, Russland-S\u00fcd, rum\u00e4nische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|right|Romanian soldiers on the outskirts of Stalingrad during the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942]]\n[[File:IAR80.jpg|thumb|right|A formation of Romanian [[IAR80]] fighter aircraft]]\n\nWhen war erupted in Europe in 1939, the [[Kingdom of Romania]] was pro-British and allied to the [[Polish-Romanian alliance|Poles]].

[[Southern Dobruja]] was ceded to [[Bulgaria]] in September 1940. In an effort to appease the Fascist elements within the country and obtain German protection, [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] appointed the General [[Ion Antonescu]] as Prime Minister on September 6, 1940.\n\nTwo days later, Antonescu forced the king to abdicate and installed the king's young son [[Michael of Romania|Michael]] (Mihai) on the throne, then declared himself ''Conduc\u0103tor'' (\"Leader\") with dictatorial powers. The [[National Legionary State]] was proclaimed on 14 September, with the [[Iron Guard]] ruling together with Antonescu as the sole legal political movement in Romania. Under King Michael I and the military government of Antonescu, Romania signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] on November 23, 1940. German troops entered the country on 10 October 1941, officially to train the Romanian Army. Hitler's directive to the troops on 10 October had stated that \"it is necessary to avoid even the slightest semblance of military occupation of Romania\".<ref>Dinu C.

From late 1940 Hitler sought a non-aggression pact with Yugoslavia. In February 1941, Hitler called for Yugoslavia's accession to the Tripartite Pact, the Yugoslav delayed.  In March, divisions of the German army arrived at the Bulgarian-Yugoslav border and permission was sought for them to pass through to attack Greece. On 25 March 1941, fearing that Yugoslavia would be invaded otherwise, the Yugoslav government signed the Tripartite Pact with significant reservations. Unlike other Axis powers, Yugoslavia was not obliged to provide military assistance, nor to provide its territory for Axis to move military forces during the war. Less than two days later, after demonstrations in the streets of Belgrade, Prince Paul and the government were removed from office by a [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Seventeen-year-old [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]] was declared to be of age. The new Yugoslav government under General [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]], refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, and started negotiations with Great Britain and Soviet Union. Winston Churchill commented that \"Yugoslavia has found its soul\"; however, Hitler invaded and quickly took control.\n\n==Co-belligerent state combatants==\nVarious countries fought side by side with the Axis powers for a common cause.

After this war, Finland sought protection and support from the United Kingdom{{sfn|Seppinen|1983|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}}<ref name=\"FOFinland\">British Foreign Office Archive, 371/24809/461-556.</ref> and non-aligned Sweden,{{sfn|Jokipii|1987|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} but was thwarted by Soviet and German actions. This resulted in Finland being drawn closer to Germany, first with the intent of enlisting German support as a counterweight to thwart continuing Soviet pressure, and later to help regain lost territories.\n\nIn the opening days of Operation Barbarossa, Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, Finland permitted German planes returning from mine dropping runs over [[Kronstadt]] and [[Neva River]] to refuel at Finnish airfields before returning to bases in [[East Prussia]]. In retaliation, the Soviet Union launched a major air offensive against Finnish airfields and towns, which resulted in a Finnish declaration of war against the Soviet Union on 25 June 1941. The Finnish conflict with the Soviet Union is generally referred to as the [[Continuation War]].\n\n[[File:Hitler Mannerheim 2.jpg|upright|thumb| [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Mannerheim]] with Hitler]]\nFinland's main objective was to regain territory lost to the Soviet Union in the Winter War. However, on 10 July 1941, Field Marshal [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] issued an [[Order of the Day]] that contained a formulation understood internationally as a Finnish territorial interest in Russian [[Karelia]].\n\nDiplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Finland were severed on 1 August 1941, after the British bombed German forces in the Finnish village and port of [[Pechenga (urban-type settlement), Murmansk Oblast|Petsamo]]. The United Kingdom repeatedly called on Finland to cease its offensive against the Soviet Union, and declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941, although no other military operations followed. War was never declared between Finland and the United States, though relations were severed between the two countries in 1944 as a result of the [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement]].\n[[File:Tali-Ihantala.jpg|left|thumb|Finnish troops passing by the remains of a destroyed Soviet T-34 at the [[battle of Tali-Ihantala]]]]\nFinland maintained command of its armed forces and pursued war objectives independently of Germany. Germans and Finns did work closely together during [[Operation Silverfox]], a joint offensive against Murmansk. Finland refused German requests to participate actively in the [[Siege of Leningrad]], and also granted asylum to Jews, while Jewish soldiers continued to serve in its army.\n\nThe relationship between Finland and Germany more closely resembled an alliance during the six weeks of the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement, which was presented as a German condition for help with munitions and air support, as the [[Fourth strategic offensive|Soviet offensive coordinated with D-Day]] threatened Finland with complete occupation. The agreement, signed by President [[Risto Ryti]] but never ratified by the Finnish Parliament, bound Finland not to seek a separate peace.\n\nAfter Soviet offensives were fought to a standstill, Ryti's successor as president, Marshall Mannerheim, dismissed the agreement and opened secret negotiations with the Soviets, which resulted in a ceasefire on 4 September and the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September 1944. Under the terms of the armistice, Finland was obliged to expel German troops from Finnish territory, which resulted in the [[Lapland War]]. Finland signed a [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|peace treaty]] with the Allied powers in 1947.\n\n===Free City of Danzig===\n{{Main|Free City of Danzig}}\nThe [[Free City of Danzig]], a semi-autonomous city-state under League of Nations protection, briefly aided the Nazis at the beginning of the [[invasion of Poland]], attacking Polish territories bordering the city.

Ali sought support from Germany and Italy in expelling British forces from Iraq.\n\nOn 9 May 1941, [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], the [[Mufti]] of [[Jerusalem]] and associate of Ali, declared holy war{{sfn|Jab\u0101rah|1985|p=183}} against the British and called on Arabs throughout the Middle East to rise up against British rule. On 25 May 1941, the Germans stepped up offensive operations in the Middle East.\n\nHitler issued [[F\u00fchrer Directive No. 30|Order 30]]: \"The Arab Freedom Movement in the Middle East is our natural ally against England. In this connection special importance is attached to the liberation of Iraq&nbsp;... I have therefore decided to move forward in the Middle East by supporting Iraq. \"<ref>Churchill, Winston (1950).

The Germans and Italians dispatched aircraft and aircrew to Iraq utilizing Vichy French bases in Syria, which would later invoke fighting between [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|Allied and Vichy French forces in Syria]].\n\nThe Germans planned to coordinate a combined German-Italian offensive against the British in Egypt, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and Iraq. Iraqi military resistance ended by 31 May 1941. Rashid Ali and the Mufti of Jerusalem fled to Iran, then Turkey, Italy, and finally Germany, where Ali was welcomed by Hitler as head of the Iraqi [[government-in-exile]] in Berlin. In propaganda broadcasts from Berlin, the Mufti continued to call on Arabs to rise up against the British and aid German and Italian forces. He also helped recruit [[Muslim]] volunteers in the Balkans for the ''[[Waffen-SS]]''.\n\n===Thailand===\n{{See also|Thailand in World War II}}\n[[File:Plaek Pibulsonggram said Chulalongkorn university student on 8 October 1940.jpg|thumb|right|[[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] gave [[ultranationalist]] speech to the crowds at the [[Grand Palace]] in 1940.]]\n\n[[Thailand]] waged the [[Franco-Thai War]] in October 1940 to May 1941 to reclaim territory from [[French Indochina]]. It became a formal ally of Japan from 25 January 1942. Japanese forces [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|invaded Thailand's territory]] an hour and a half before the attack on Pearl Harbor (because of the International Dateline, the local time was on the morning of 8 December 1941). Only hours after the invasion, Prime Minister Field Marshal [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram|Phibunsongkhram]] ordered the cessation of resistance against the Japanese. On 21 December 1941, a military alliance with Japan was signed and on 25 January 1942, [[Sang Phathanothai]] read over the radio Thailand's formal declaration of war on the United Kingdom and the United States. The Thai ambassador to the United States, [[Mom Rajawongse]] [[Seni Pramoj]], did not deliver his copy of the declaration of war. Therefore, although the British reciprocated by declaring war on Thailand and considered it a hostile country, the United States did not.\n\nThe Thais and Japanese agreed that [[Shan State]] and [[Kayah State]] were to be under Thai control. The rest of Burma was to be under Japanese control. On 10 May 1942, the Thai [[Phayap Army]] entered Burma's eastern Shan State, which had been claimed by Siamese kingdoms. Three Thai infantry and one cavalry division, spearheaded by armoured reconnaissance groups and supported by the air force, engaged the retreating Chinese 93rd Division. [[Kengtung]], the main objective, was captured on 27 May. Renewed offensives in June and November saw the Chinese retreat into [[Yunnan]].<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027105102/http://geocities.com/thailandwwii/shans.html |archivedate=2009-10-27|url=http://geocities.com/thailandwwii/shans.html |title=Thailand and the Second World War }}</ref> The area containing the Shan States and Kayah State was annexed by Thailand in 1942. The areas were ceded back to [[Burma]] in 1945.\n\nThe [[Free Thai Movement]] (\"Seri Thai\") was established during these first few months. Parallel Free Thai organizations were also established in the United Kingdom. Queen [[Rambai Barni]] was the nominal head of the British-based organization, and [[Pridi Banomyong]], the regent, headed its largest contingent, which was operating within Thailand. Aided by elements of the military, secret airfields and training camps were established, while [[Office of Strategic Services]] and [[Force 136]] agents slipped in and out of the country.\n\nAs the war dragged on, the Thai population came to resent the Japanese presence. In June 1944, Phibun was overthrown in a coup d'\u00e9tat. The new civilian government under [[Khuang Aphaiwong]] attempted to aid the resistance while maintaining cordial relations with the Japanese. After the war, U. S. influence prevented Thailand from being treated as an Axis country, but the British demanded three million tons of rice as reparations and the return of areas annexed from [[British Malaya|Malaya]] during the war. Thailand also returned the portions of British Burma and French Indochina that had been annexed. Phibun and a number of his associates were put on trial on charges of having committed war crimes and of collaborating with the Axis powers. However, the charges were dropped due to intense public pressure. Public opinion was favorable to Phibun, as he was thought to have done his best to protect Thai interests.\n\n==Client states==\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\n\n===German===\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\nThe collaborationist administrations of German-occupied countries in Europe had varying degrees of autonomy, and not all of them qualified as fully recognized [[sovereign state]]s. The [[General Government]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]] was a German administration, not a Polish government. In [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupied Norway]], the [[Quisling regime|National Government]] headed by [[Vidkun Quisling]] \u2013 whose name [[Quisling|came to symbolize pro-Axis collaboration]] in several languages \u2013 was subordinate to the [[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]]. It was never allowed to have any armed forces, be a recognized military partner, or have autonomy of any kind. In [[History of the Netherlands (1939\u20131945)|the occupied Netherlands]], [[Anton Mussert]] was given the symbolic title of \"F\u00fchrer of the Netherlands' people\". His [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|National Socialist Movement]] formed a cabinet assisting the German administration, but was never recognized as a real Dutch government. The following list of German client states includes only those entities that were officially{{who|date=March 2020}} considered to be independent countries allied with Germany. They were under varying degrees of German influence and control, but were not ruled directly by Germans.\n\n====Albania (under German control)====\n{{Main|Albanian Kingdom (1943\u20131944)}}\nAfter the Italian armistice, a vacuum of power opened up in [[Albania under Italy|Albania]]. The Italian occupying forces were rendered largely powerless, as the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Movement]] took control of the south and the National Front ([[Balli Komb\u00ebtar]]) took control of the north. Albanians in the Italian army joined the guerrilla forces. In September 1943 the guerrillas moved to take the capital of [[Tirana]], but German paratroopers dropped into the city. Soon after the battle, the German High Command announced that they would recognize the independence of a [[greater Albania]]. They organized an Albanian government, police, and military in collaboration with the Balli Komb\u00ebtar. The Germans did not exert heavy control over Albania's administration, but instead attempted to gain popular appeal by giving their political partners what they wanted. Several Balli Komb\u00ebtar leaders held positions in the regime. The joint forces incorporated Kosovo, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, and Presevo into the Albanian state. A High Council of Regency was created to carry out the functions of a head of state, while the government was headed mainly by Albanian conservative politicians. Albania was the only European country occupied by the Axis powers that ended World War II with a larger Jewish population than before the war.{{sfn|Sarner|1997|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} The Albanian government had refused to hand over their Jewish population.

It was appointed by the German Military Commander in Serbia and operated from 29 August 1941 to October 1944. The Serbian puppet state enjoyed significant support.<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=David Bruce|title=Balkan holocausts?: Serbian and Croatian victim-centred propaganda and the war in Yugoslavia|date=2002|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0719064678|page=142}}</ref> The Prime Minister throughout was General [[Milan Nedi\u0107]]. The Government of National Salvation was evacuated from Belgrade to [[Kitzb\u00fchel]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in the first week of October 1944 before the German withdrawal from Serbia was complete.\n\nRacial laws were introduced in all occupied territories with immediate effects on Jews and Roma people, as well as causing the imprisonment of those opposed to Nazism. Several concentration camps were formed in Serbia and at the 1942 Anti-Freemason Exhibition in Belgrade the city was pronounced to be free of Jews (Judenfrei). On 1 April 1942, a Serbian Gestapo was formed. An estimated 120,000 people were interned in German-run concentration camps in Nedi\u0107's Serbia between 1941 and 1944. 50,000 to 80,000 were killed during this period. Serbia became the second country in Europe, following Estonia, to be proclaimed Judenfrei (free of Jews). Approximately 14,500 Serbian Jews \u2013 90 percent of Serbia's Jewish population of 16,000 \u2013 were murdered in World War II.\n\nCollaborationist armed formations forces were involved, either directly or indirectly, in the mass killings of Jews, Roma and those Serbs who sided with any anti-German resistance or were suspects of being a member of such. These forces were also responsible for the killings of many Croats and Muslims; however, some Croats who took refuge in Nedi\u0107's Serbia were not discriminated against. After the war, the Serbian involvement in many of these events and the issue of Serbian collaboration were subject to historical revisionism by later public figures.\n\nNedi\u0107 himself was captured by the Americans when they occupied the former territory of Austria, and was subsequently handed over to the Yugoslav communist authorities to act as a witness against war criminals, on the understanding he would be returned to American custody to face trial by the Allies. The Yugoslav authorities refused to return Nedi\u0107 to United States custody. He died on 4 February 1946 after either jumping or falling out of the window of a Belgrade hospital, under circumstances which remain unclear.\n\n====Italy (Italian Social Republic)====\n{{Main|Italian Social Republic}}\n[[File:Italian social republic map.png|thumb|Italian Social Republic]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-311-0926-07, Italien, italienische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|left|RSI ([[Italian Social Republic|Repubblica Sociale Italiana]]) soldiers, March 1944]]\n\nItalian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]] formed the Italian Social Republic (''Repubblica Sociale Italiana'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) on 23 September 1943, succeeding the Kingdom of Italy as a member of the Axis.\n\nMussolini had been removed from office and arrested by King Victor Emmanuel III on 25 July 1943. After the Italian armistice, in a [[Gran Sasso raid|raid]] led by German paratrooper [[Otto Skorzeny]], Mussolini was rescued from arrest.\n\nOnce restored to power, Mussolini declared that Italy was a [[republic]] and that he was the new head of state. He was subject to German control for the duration of the war.\n\n====Slovakia (Tiso regime)====\n{{Main|Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak invasion of Poland}}\n[[File:Slovakia1941 02.png|thumb|Slovakia in 1941]]\nThe [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovak Republic]] under President [[Josef Tiso]] signed the Tripartite Pact on 24 November 1940.\n\nSlovakia had been closely aligned with Germany almost immediately from its declaration of independence from Czechoslovakia on 14 March 1939. Slovakia entered into a treaty of protection with Germany on 23 March 1939.\n\nSlovak troops joined the German invasion of Poland, having interest in [[Spi\u0161]] and [[Orava (region)|Orava]]. Those two regions, along with [[Cieszyn Silesia]], had been [[Polish-Czechoslovak border conflicts|disputed]] between Poland and Czechoslovakia since 1918. The Poles fully annexed them following the [[Munich Agreement]]. After the invasion of Poland, Slovakia reclaimed control of those territories.\n[[File:Andrzeja Olejko S\u0142owackie epizody z polskiego Podkarpacia Sanok 39.jpg|thumb|Slovak troops led by General [[Ferdinand \u010catlo\u0161]] (center) pose with a statue of [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]] in [[Sanok]] during the Invasion of Poland.]]\nSlovakia invaded Poland alongside German forces, contributing 50,000 men at this stage of the war.\n\nSlovakia declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941 and signed the revived Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941. Slovak troops fought on Germany's Eastern Front, furnishing Germany with two divisions totaling 80,000 men. Slovakia declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States in 1942.\n\nSlovakia was spared German military occupation until the [[Slovak National Uprising]], which began on 29 August 1944, and was almost immediately crushed by the Waffen SS and Slovak troops loyal to Josef Tiso.\n\nAfter the war, Tiso was executed and Slovakia once again became part of Czechoslovakia. The border with Poland was shifted back to the pre-war state. Slovakia and the Czech Republic finally separated into independent states in 1993.\n\n===Italian===\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\nItaly occupied several nations and set up clients in those regions to carry out administrative tasks and maintain order.\n\n====Monaco====\nThe [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] was officially neutral during the war. The population of the country was largely of Italian descent and sympathized with Italy. Its prince was a close friend of the Vichy French leader, Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, an Axis collaborator. A fascist regime was established under the nominal rule of the prince when the Italian Fourth Army occupied the country on November 10, 1942 as a part of [[Case Anton]]. Monaco's military forces, consisting primarily of police and palace guards, collaborated with the Italians during the occupation. German troops occupied Monaco in 1943, and Monaco was liberated by Allied forces in 1944.\n\n===Joint German-Italian client states===\n<!-- Puppet states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\n\n====Croatia (Independent State of Croatia)====\n{{Main|Independent State of Croatia}}\n[[File:Adolf Hitler meets Ante Paveli\u0107.1941.jpg|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] meeting with NDH leader [[Ante Paveli\u0107]].]]\n\nOn 10 April 1941, the Independent State of Croatia (''Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska'', or NDH) declared itself a member of the Axis, co-signing the Tripartite Pact. The NDH remained a member of the Axis until the end of Second World War, its forces fighting for Germany even after its territory had been overrun by [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. On 16 April 1941, [[Ante Paveli\u0107]], a Croatian nationalist and one of the founders of the [[Usta\u0161e]] (''\"Croatian Liberation Movement\"''), was proclaimed ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (leader) of the new regime.\n\nInitially the Usta\u0161e had been heavily influenced by Italy. They were actively supported by Mussolini's Fascist regime in Italy, which gave the movement training grounds to prepare for war against Yugoslavia, as well as accepting Paveli\u0107 as an exile and allowing him to reside in Rome. Italy intended to use the movement to destroy Yugoslavia, which would allow Italy to expand its power through the Adriatic. Hitler did not want to engage in a war in the Balkans until the Soviet Union was defeated. The Italian occupation of Greece was not going well; Mussolini wanted Germany to invade Yugoslavia to save the Italian forces in Greece. Hitler reluctantly agreed; Yugoslavia was invaded and the Independent State of Croatia was created. Paveli\u0107 led a delegation to Rome and offered the crown of Croatia to an Italian prince of the House of Savoy, who was crowned ''[[Tomislav II]], King of Croatia, Prince of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Voivode of Dalmatia, [[Tuzla]] and Knin, Prince of [[Cisterna]] and of Belriguardo, Marquess of [[Voghera]], and Count of [[Ponderano]].'' The next day, Paveli\u0107 signed the Contracts of Rome with Mussolini, ceding Dalmatia to Italy and fixing the permanent borders between the NDH and Italy. Italian armed forces were allowed to control all of the coastline of the NDH, effectively giving Italy total control of the Adriatic coastline.\n\nHowever, strong German influence began to be asserted soon after the NDH was founded. When the King of Italy ousted Mussolini from power and Italy capitulated, the NDH became completely under German influence.\n\nThe platform of the Usta\u0161e movement proclaimed that Croatians had been oppressed by the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and that Croatians deserved to have an independent nation after years of domination by foreign empires. The Usta\u0161e perceived Serbs to be racially inferior to Croats and saw them as infiltrators who were occupying Croatian lands. They saw the extermination of Serbs as necessary to racially purify Croatia. While part of Yugoslavia, many Croatian nationalists violently opposed the Serb-dominated Yugoslav monarchy, and assassinated [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]], together with the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]]. The regime enjoyed support amongst radical Croatian nationalists. Ustashe forces fought against communist Yugoslav Partisan guerrilla throughout the war.\n\nUpon coming to power, Paveli\u0107 formed the Croatian Home Guard (''Hrvatsko domobranstvo'') as the official military force of the NDH. Originally authorized at 16,000 men, it grew to a peak fighting force of 130,000. The Croatian Home Guard included an air force and navy, although its navy was restricted in size by the Contracts of Rome. In addition to the Croatian Home Guard, Paveli\u0107 was also the supreme commander of the [[Usta\u0161e militia]], although all NDH military units were generally under the command of the German or Italian formations in their area of operations.\n\nThe Usta\u0161e government declared war on the Soviet Union, signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941, and sent troops to Germany's Eastern Front. Usta\u0161e militia were garrisoned in the Balkans, battling the communist partisans.\n\nThe Usta\u0161e government applied racial laws on Serbs, Jews, [[Romani people]], as well as targeting those opposed to the fascist regime, and after June 1941 deported them to the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] or to German camps in Poland. The racial laws were enforced by the Usta\u0161e militia. The exact number of victims of the Usta\u0161e regime is uncertain due to the destruction of documents and varying numbers given by historians. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, between 320,000 and 340,000 Serbs were killed in the NDH.<ref name=\"US Holocaust Memorial Museum\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20030711191159/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005449 Jasenovac] United States Holocaust Memorial Museum web site</ref>\n\n====Greece (Hellenic State)====\n{{Main|Axis occupation of Greece|Hellenic State (1941\u20131944)}}\n[[File:Greece Prefectures 1941-44.png|thumb|Greece, 1941\u20131944]]\nFollowing the [[Battle of Greece|German invasion]] of Greece and the flight of the [[Greek government in exile|Greek government]] to Crete and then Egypt, the [[Hellenic State (1941-1944)|Hellenic State]] was formed in May 1941 as a puppet state of both Italy and Germany. Initially, Italy had wished to annex Greece, but was pressured by Germany to avoid civil unrest such as had occurred in Bulgarian-annexed areas. The result was Italy accepting the creation of a puppet regime with the support of Germany. Italy had been assured by Hitler of a primary role in Greece. Most of the country was held by Italian forces, but strategic locations ([[Central Macedonia]], the islands of the northeastern Aegean, most of [[Crete]], and parts of [[Attica]]) were held by the Germans, who seized most of the country's economic assets and effectively controlled the collaborationist government. The puppet regime never commanded any real authority, and did not gain the allegiance of the people. It was somewhat successful in preventing secessionist movements like the [[Vlach \"Roman Legion\"]] from establishing themselves. By mid-1943, the [[Greek Resistance]] had liberated large parts of the mountainous interior (\"Free Greece\"), setting up a separate administration there. After the Italian armistice, the Italian occupation zone was taken over by the German armed forces, who remained in charge of the country until their withdrawal in autumn 1944. In some Aegean islands, German garrisons were left behind, and surrendered only after the end of the war.\n\n===Japanese===\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\n{{further|Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere}}\nThe Empire of Japan created a number of client states in the areas occupied by its military, beginning with the creation of Manchukuo in 1932. These puppet states achieved varying degrees of international recognition.\n\n====Burma (Ba Maw regime)====\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of Burma|State of Burma|Burma National Army}}\nThe Japanese Army and Burma nationalists, led by [[Aung San]], seized control of Burma from the United Kingdom during 1942. A [[State of Burma]] was formed on 1 August under the Burmese nationalist leader [[Ba Maw]]. The Ba Maw regime established the Burma Defence Army (later renamed the [[Burma National Army]]), which was commanded by [[Aung San]].\n\n====Cambodia====\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of Cambodia}}\nThe [[Colonial Cambodia#Emergence of Khmer nationalism|Kingdom of Cambodia]] was a short-lived Japanese puppet state that lasted from 9 March 1945 to 15 August 1945.\n\nThe Japanese entered Cambodia in mid-1941, but allowed Vichy French officials to remain in administrative posts. The Japanese calls for an \"Asia for the Asiatics\" won over many Cambodian nationalists.\n\nThis policy changed during the last months of the war. The Japanese wanted to gain local support, so they dissolved French colonial rule and pressured Cambodia to declare its independence within the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. Four days later, King [[Norodom Sihanouk|Sihanouk]] declared Kampuchea (the original [[Khmer language|Khmer]] pronunciation of Cambodia) independent. Co-editor of the ''Nagaravatta'', [[Son Ngoc Thanh]], returned from Tokyo in May and was appointed foreign minister.\n\nOn the date of Japanese surrender, a new government was proclaimed with Son Ngoc Thanh as prime minister. When the Allies occupied [[Phnom Penh]] in October, Son Ngoc Thanh was arrested for collaborating with the Japanese and was exiled to France. Some of his supporters went to northwestern Cambodia, which had been under Thai control since the [[French-Thai War]] of 1940, where they banded together as one faction in the [[Khmer Issarak]] movement, originally formed with Thai encouragement in the 1940s.\n\n====China (Reorganized National Government of China)====\n{{Main|Wang Jingwei regime}}\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Japan advanced from its bases in Manchuria to occupy much of East and Central China. Several Japanese puppet states were organized in areas occupied by the Japanese Army, including the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1937\u20131940)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] at [[Beijing]], which was formed in 1937, and the [[Reformed Government of the Republic of China]] at Nanjing, which was formed in 1938. These governments were merged into the [[Reorganized National Government of China]] at Nanjing on 29 March 1940. [[Wang Jingwei]] became head of state. The government was to be run along the same lines as the Nationalist regime and adopted its symbols.\n\nThe Nanjing Government had no real power; its main role was to act as a propaganda tool for the Japanese. The Nanjing Government concluded agreements with Japan and Manchukuo, authorising Japanese occupation of China and recognising the independence of Manchukuo under Japanese protection. The Nanjing Government signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941 and declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom on 9 January 1943.\n\nThe government had a strained relationship with the Japanese from the beginning. Wang's insistence on his regime being the true Nationalist government of China and in replicating all the symbols of the [[Kuomintang]] led to frequent conflicts with the Japanese, the most prominent being the issue of the regime's flag, which was identical to that of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].\n\nThe worsening situation for Japan from 1943 onwards meant that the Nanking Army was given a more substantial role in the defence of occupied China than the Japanese had initially envisaged. The army was almost continuously employed against the communist [[New Fourth Army]].\n\nWang Jingwei died on 10 November 1944, and was succeeded by his deputy, [[Chen Gongbo]]. Chen had little influence; the real power behind the regime was [[Zhou Fohai]], the mayor of Shanghai. Wang's death dispelled what little legitimacy the regime had. The state stuttered on for another year and continued the display and show of a fascist regime.\n\nOn 9 September 1945, following the defeat of Japan, the area was surrendered to General [[He Yingqin]], a nationalist general loyal to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. The Nanking Army generals quickly declared their alliance to the Generalissimo, and were subsequently ordered to resist Communist attempts to fill the vacuum left by the Japanese surrender. Chen Gongbo was tried and executed in 1946.\n\n====India (Provisional Government of Free India)====\n{{Main|Azad Hind Fauj|Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind}}\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:INA Jubilation.jpg|thumb|[[Indian National Army]] soldiers in Asia]] -->\n\nThe ''Arzi Hukumat-e-[[Azad Hind]]'', the Provisional Government of Free India was a state that was recognized by nine Axis governments. It was led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], an [[Indian nationalist]] who rejected [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]]'s nonviolent methods for achieving independence. The [[First INA]] faltered after its leadership objected to being a propaganda tool for Japanese war aims, and the role of [[I Kikan]]. It was revived by the [[Indian Independence League]] with Japanese support in 1942 after the ex-PoWs and Indian civilians in South-east Asia agreed to participate in the INA venture on the condition it was led by [[Subhash Chandra Bose]]. Bose declared India's independence on October 21, 1943. The Indian National Army was committed as a part of the [[U Go Offensive]]. It played a largely marginal role in the battle, and suffered serious casualties and had to withdraw with the rest of Japanese forces after the [[Battle of Imphal|siege of Imphal]] was broken. It was later committed to the defence of Burma [[Burma Campaign 1944\u201345|against the Allied offensive]]. It suffered a large number of desertions in this latter part. The remaining troops of the INA maintained order in Rangoon after the withdrawal of Ba Maw's government. although The provisional government was given nominal control of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] from November 1943 to August 1945.\n\n====Inner Mongolia (Mengjiang)====\n{{Main|Mengjiang}}\n[[Mengjiang]] was a Japanese puppet state in [[Inner Mongolia]]. It was nominally ruled by Prince [[Demchugdongrub]], a [[Mongol]] nobleman descended from [[Genghis Khan]], but was in fact controlled by the Japanese military. Mengjiang's independence was proclaimed on 18 February 1936, following the Japanese occupation of the region.\n\nThe Inner Mongolians had several grievances against the central Chinese government in Nanking, including their policy of allowing unlimited migration of Han Chinese to the region. Several of the young princes of Inner Mongolia began to agitate for greater freedom from the central government, and it was through these men that Japanese saw their best chance of exploiting Pan-Mongol nationalism and eventually seizing control of Outer Mongolia from the Soviet Union.\n\nJapan created Mengjiang to exploit tensions between ethnic Mongolians and the central government of China, which in theory ruled Inner Mongolia. When the various puppet governments of China were unified under the [[Wang Jingwei]] government in March 1940, Mengjiang retained its separate identity as an autonomous federation. Although under the firm control of the Japanese Imperial Army, which occupied its territory, Prince Demchugdongrub had his own independent army.\n\nMengjiang vanished in 1945 following Japan's defeat in World War II. As Soviet forces advanced into Inner Mongolia, they met limited resistance from small detachments of Mongolian cavalry, which, like the rest of the army, were quickly overwhelmed.\n\n====Laos====\n{{Main|French Protectorate of Laos#Japanese occupation of Laos}}\nFears of Thai irredentism led to the formation of the first Lao nationalist organization, the Movement for National Renovation, in January 1941. The group was led by Prince [[Phetsarath Rattanavongsa|Phetxar\u0101t]] and supported by local French officials, though not by the Vichy authorities in [[Hanoi]]. This group wrote the current [[Pheng Xat Lao|Lao national anthem]] and designed the current [[Flag of Laos|Lao flag]], while paradoxically pledging support for France. The country declared its independence in 1945.\n\nThe liberation of France in 1944, bringing [[Charles de Gaulle]] to power, meant the end of the alliance between Japan and the Vichy French administration in Indochina. The Japanese had no intention of allowing the [[Gaullist]]s to take over, and in March 1945 they staged a military coup in Hanoi. Some French units fled over the mountains to Laos, pursued by the Japanese, who occupied [[Vientiane|Viang Chan]] in March 1945 and [[Luang Prabang|Luang Phrab\u0101ng]] in April. King [[Sisavang Vong|S\u012bsav\u0101ngvong]] was detained by the Japanese, but his son Crown Prince [[Savang Vatthana|Sav\u0101ngvatthan\u0101]] called on all [[Lao people|Lao]] to assist the French, and many Lao died fighting against the Japanese occupiers.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nPrince Phetxar\u0101t opposed this position. He thought that Lao independence could be gained by siding with the Japanese, who made him Prime Minister of Luang Phrab\u0101ng, though not of Laos as a whole. The country was in chaos, and Phetxar\u0101t's government had no real authority. Another Lao group, the Lao S\u0113ri (Free Lao), received unofficial support from the Free Thai movement in the [[Isan]] region.\n\n====Manchuria (Manchukuo)====\n{{Main|Manchukuo}}\n[[File:Military exercise of Manchukuo Imperial Army.JPG|thumb|Manchurian soldiers training in a military exercise]]\n[[File:Manchukuo Air Force.JPG|thumb|Manchurian pilots of the Manchukuo Air Force]]\n\nManchukuo, in the northeast region of China, had been a Japanese puppet state in [[Manchuria]] since the 1930s. It was nominally ruled by [[Puyi]], the last emperor of the [[Qing Dynasty]], but was in fact controlled by the Japanese military, in particular the [[Kwantung Army]]. While Manchukuo ostensibly was a state for ethnic [[Manchu people|Manchus]], the region had a [[Han Chinese]] majority.\n\nFollowing the [[Mukden Incident|Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931, the independence of Manchukuo was proclaimed on 18 February 1932, with Puyi as head of state. He was proclaimed the Emperor of Manchukuo a year later. The new Manchu nation was recognized by 23 of the [[League of Nations]]' 80 members. Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union were among the major powers who recognised Manchukuo. Other countries who recognized the State were the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], and [[Vatican City]]. Manchukuo was also recognised by the other Japanese allies and puppet states, including Mengjiang, the Burmese government of [[Ba Maw]], [[Thailand]], the Wang Jingwei regime, and the Indian government of [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. The League of Nations later declared in 1934 that Manchuria lawfully remained a part of China. This precipitated Japanese withdrawal from the League. The Manchukuoan state ceased to exist after the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] in 1945.\n\n====Philippines (Second Republic)====\n{{main|Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Second Philippine Republic}}\nAfter the [[Battle of Bataan#The Fall of Bataan|surrender]] of the Filipino and American forces in [[Bataan Peninsula]] and [[Corregidor Island]], the Japanese established a puppet state in the Philippines in 1942.<ref>{{cite book |last=Guillermo |first=Artemio R. |title=Historical Dictionary of the Philippines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmgX9M_yETIC&lpg=PA211&dq=Support%20Second%20Republic%20Philippines&pg=PA211#v=onepage&q=Support%20Second%20Republic%20Philippines&f=false |accessdate=22 March 2013 |year=2012 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-7246-2 |pages=211, 621}}</ref> The following year, the [[National Assembly of the Philippines|Philippine National Assembly]] declared the Philippines an [[Second Philippine Republic|independent Republic]] and elected [[Jos\u00e9 P.

This French rule ended on 9 March 1945, when the Japanese officially took control of the government.

In the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Soviet Union gave military aid to the [[Second Spanish Republic]], against [[Spanish State|Spanish Nationalist]] forces, which were assisted by Germany and Italy. However, the Nationalist forces were victorious. The Soviets suffered another political defeat when their ally Czechoslovakia was partitioned and taken over by Germany in 1938\u201339. In 1938 and 1939, the USSR fought and defeated Japan in two separate border conflicts, at [[Battle of Lake Khasan|Lake Khasan]] and [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]]. The latter was a major Soviet victory that led the Japanese Army to avoid war with the Soviets and instead call for expansion south.\n\nIn 1939 the Soviet Union considered forming an alliance with either [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Britain and France]] or with Germany.{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=112\u2013120}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=495\u2013496}} When negotiations with Britain and France failed, they turned to Germany and signed the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. Germany was now freed from the risk of war with the Soviets, and was assured a supply of oil. This included a secret protocol whereby the independent countries of [[Poland]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Romania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] were divided into [[spheres of interest]] of the parties.{{sfn|Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} The Soviet Union had been forced to cede the [[Kresy]] (Western [[Belarus]] and Western [[Ukraine]]) to Poland after losing the [[Soviet-Polish War]] of 1919\u20131921, and the Soviet Union sought to re-annex those territories.<ref name=\"Eastern Europe 2004, Pp. 138-139\"/>\n\nOn 1 September, barely a week after the pact had been signed, [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]]. The Soviet Union [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded Poland from the east]] on 17 September and on 28 September signed a [[German-Soviet Frontier Treaty|secret treaty]] with Nazi Germany to arrange coordination of fighting against Polish resistance. The Soviets targeted intelligence, entrepreneurs, and officers, committing a string of atrocities that culminated in the [[Katyn massacre]] and mass relocation to the [[Gulag]] in Siberia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/nazsov.asp|title=Avalon Project - Nazi-Soviet Relations 1939-1941|website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}</ref>\n\nSoon thereafter, the Soviet Union [[Occupation of Baltic Republics|occupied the Baltic countries]] of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania,{{sfn|Senn|2007|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}}{{sfn|Wettig|2008|pp=20\u201321}} and annexed [[Bessarabia]] and [[Bukovina|Northern Bukovina]] from Romania.

These and other export goods transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories allowed Germany to circumvent the British naval blockade.\n\nIn October and November 1940, [[German\u2013Soviet Axis talks|German-Soviet talks]] about the potential of joining the Axis took place in Berlin.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=58}}{{sfn|Brackman|2001|p=341\u2013343}} [[Joseph Stalin]] later personally countered with a separate proposal in a letter on 25 November that contained several secret protocols, including that \"the area south of [[Batum]] and [[Baku]] in the general direction of the [[Persian Gulf]] is recognized as the center of aspirations of the Soviet Union\", referring to an area approximating present day Iraq and Iran, and a Soviet claim to Bulgaria.{{sfn|Brackman|2001|p=341\u2013343}}{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202\u2013205}} Hitler never responded to Stalin's letter.{{sfn|Donaldson|Nogee|2005|pp=65\u201366}}{{sfn|Churchill|1953|pp=520\u2013521}} Shortly thereafter, Hitler issued a secret directive on the invasion of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202\u2013205}}{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=59}}\n\nGermany ended the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact by invading the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]] on 22 June 1941.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=82}} That resulted in the Soviet Union becoming one of the main members of [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]].\n\nGermany then revived its Anti-Comintern Pact, enlisting many European and Asian countries in opposition to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and Japan remained neutral towards each other for most of the war by the [[Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact]].

It retained full control of the [[zone libre|non-occupied part of France]] until November 1942, and a large part of France's [[French colonial empire|colonial empire]], until the colonies gradually fell under [[Free French]] control.\n\nThe German invasion army entered Paris on 14 June 1940, following the [[battle of France]]. P\u00e9tain became the last Prime Minister of the [[French Third Republic]] on 16 June 1940. He sued for peace with Germany and on 22 June 1940, the French government [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|concluded an armistice]] with Hitler and Mussolini, which came into effect at midnight on 25 June. Under the terms of the agreement, Germany [[occupied France|occupied two-thirds]] of France, including Paris. P\u00e9tain was permitted to keep an \"armistice army\" of 100,000 men within the unoccupied southern zone. This number included neither the army based in the [[French colonial empire]] nor the French fleet. In Africa the Vichy regime was permitted to maintain 127,000.{{sfn|Bachelier|2000|p=98}} The French also maintained substantial garrisons at the French-mandated territory of [[Syrian Republic (1930-1958)|Syria]] and [[Greater Lebanon]], the French colony of [[French Madagascar|Madagascar]], and in [[French Somaliland]]. Some members of the Vichy government pushed for closer cooperation, but they were rebuffed by P\u00e9tain. Neither did Hitler accept that France could ever become a full military partner,{{sfn|Paxton|1993}} and constantly prevented the buildup of Vichy's military strength.\n\nAfter the armistice, relations between the Vichy French and the British quickly worsened. Although the French had told Churchill they would not allow their fleet to be taken by the Germans, the British launched several naval attacks, the most notable of which was against [[Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|the Algerian harbour of Mers el-Kebir]] on 3 July 1940. Though Churchill defended his controversial decision to attack the French fleet, the action deteriorated greatly the relations between France and Britain. German propaganda trumpeted these attacks as an absolute betrayal of the French people by their former allies.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25217, Henry Philippe Petain und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|[[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] (left) meeting with Hitler in October 1940.]]\n[[File:Flag of Philippe P\u00e9tain, Chief of State of Vichy France.svg|thumb|Personal flag of Philippe P\u00e9tain, Chief of State of [[Vichy France]].]]\nOn 10 July 1940, P\u00e9tain was given emergency \"full powers\" by a majority vote of the [[French National Assembly]].

Racial laws were introduced in France and its colonies and many [[History of the Jews in France|foreign Jews in France]] were deported to Germany. [[Albert Lebrun]], last President of the Republic, did not resign from the presidential office when he moved to [[Vizille]] on 10 July 1940.

British and Free French forces attacked later [[Syria-Lebanon campaign|Syria and Lebanon in June\u2013July 1941]], and in 1942 Allied forces [[Battle of Madagascar|took over French Madagascar]]. More and more colonies abandoned Vichy, joining the Free French territories of [[French Equatorial Africa]], [[French Polynesia|Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]] and others who had sided with de Gaulle [[Appeal of 18 June|from the start]].\n\nIn November 1942 Vichy French troops briefly resisted the [[Operation Torch|landing of Allied troops in French North Africa]] for two days, until Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] negotiated a local ceasefire with the Allies. In response to the landings, [[Case Anton|Axis troops invaded]] the non-occupied zone in southern France and ended Vichy France as an entity with any kind of autonomy; it then became a puppet government for the occupied territories.\n\nIn June 1943, the formerly Vichy-loyal colonial authorities in [[French North Africa]] led by [[Henri Giraud]] came to an agreement with the [[Free French]] to merge with their own interim regime with the [[Free France#Creation of the French National Committee (CNF)|French National Committee]] (''Comit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ais National'', CFN) to form a [[provisional government]] in [[Algiers]], known as the [[French Committee of National Liberation]] (''Comit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ais de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale'', CFLN) initially led by Darlan. After his assassination De Gaulle emerged as the uncontested French leader. The CFLN raised more troops and re-organised, re-trained and re-equipped the Free French military, in cooperation with Allied forces in preparation of future operations [[Operation Husky|against Italy]] and the [[Operation Overlord|German Atlantic wall]].\n\nIn 1943 the [[Milice]], a paramilitary force which had been founded by Vichy, was subordinated to the Germans and assisted them in rounding up opponents and Jews, as well as fighting the [[French Resistance]]. The Germans recruited volunteers in units independent of Vichy. Partly as a result of the great animosity of many right-wingers against the pre-war [[Front Populaire]], volunteers joined the German forces in their anti-communist crusade against the USSR. Almost 7,000 joined ''[[Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism|L\u00e9gion des Volontaires Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (LVF) from 1941 to 1944. The LVF then formed the cadre of the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)|Waffen-SS Division ''Charlemagne'']] in 1944\u20131945, with a maximum strength of some 7,500. Both the LVF and the ''Division Charlemagne'' fought on the eastern front.\n\nDeprived of any military assets, territory or resources, the members of the Vichy government continued to fulfil their role as German puppets, being quasi-prisoners in the so-called \"[[Sigmaringen enclave]]\" in a castle in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at the end of the war in May 1945.\n\n==German, Italian and Japanese World War II cooperation==\n===German-Japanese Axis-cooperation===\n{{Main|Germany\u2013Japan relations#Rapprochement, Axis and World War II (1920\u20131945)}}\n{{see also|Germany\u2013Japan industrial co-operation before World War II}}\n\n===Germany's and Italy's declaration of war against the United States===\nOn 7 December 1941, Japan [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the US naval bases in Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii.

The Axis powers agreed on their opposition to the Allies, but did not completely coordinate their activity.\n\nThe Axis grew out of the diplomatic efforts of Germany, Italy, and Japan to secure their own specific expansionist interests in the mid-1930s. The first step was the treaty signed by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in October 1936. [[Benito Mussolini]] declared on 1 November 1936 that all other European countries would from then on rotate on the Rome\u2013Berlin axis, thus creating the term \"Axis\".<ref name=\"Schmitz\">{{cite book |author=Cornelia Schmitz-Berning |title=Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |page=745 |year=2007 |isbn=978-3-11-019549-1 }}<!--|accessdate=26 March 2015 --></ref><ref name=\"GlobSec\">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/int/axis.htm |title=Axis |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=26 March 2015 }}</ref> The almost simultaneous second step was the signing in November 1936 of the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], an anti-communist treaty between Germany and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Italy joined the Pact in 1937. The \"Rome\u2013Berlin Axis\" became a [[Collective defense|military alliance]] in 1939 under the so-called \"[[Pact of Steel]]\", with the [[Tripartite Pact]] of 1940 leading to the integration of the military aims of Germany, Italy and Japan.\n\nAt its zenith during World War II, the Axis presided over territories that occupied large parts of [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and [[East Asia]]. There were no three-way summit meetings and cooperation and coordination was minimal, with slightly more between Germany and Italy. The war ended in 1945 with the defeat of the Axis powers and the dissolution of their alliance. As in the case of the Allies, membership of the Axis was fluid, with some nations switching sides or changing their degree of military involvement over the course of the war.\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Origins and creation==\n{{Fascism sidebar}}\n{{Main|Tripartite Pact}}\nThe term \"axis\" was first applied to the Italo-German relationship by the Italian prime minister [[Benito Mussolini]] in September 1923, when he wrote in the preface to Roberto Suster's ''Germania Repubblica'' that \"there is no doubt that in this moment the axis of European history passes through Berlin\" (''non v'ha dubbio che in questo momento l'asse della storia europea passa per Berlino'').<ref>Martin-Dietrich Glessgen and G\u00fcnter Holtus, eds., ''Genesi e dimensioni di un vocabolario etimologico'', Lessico Etimologico Italiano: Etymologie und Wortgeschichte des Italienischen (Ludwig Reichert, 1992), p. 63.</ref> At the time, he was seeking an alliance with the [[Weimar Republic]] against [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] in the dispute over the [[Free State of Fiume]].<ref name=Watt>D.

When Mussolini publicly announced the signing on 1 November, he proclaimed the creation of a Rome\u2013Berlin axis.<ref name=Watt/>\n\n===Initial proposals of a German\u2013Italian alliance===\nItaly under ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] had pursued a strategic alliance of Italy with Germany against France since the early 1920s.<ref name=\"MacGregor Knox 2000.

The German ambassador to Italy in 1924 reported that Mussolini saw a nationalist Germany as an essential ally for Italy against France, and hoped to tap into the desire within the German army and the German political right for a war of revenge against France.<ref name=\"MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124\"/>\n\nDuring the Weimar Republic, the German government did not respect the Treaty of Versailles that it had been pressured to sign, and various government figures at the time rejected Germany's post-Versailles borders. General [[Hans von Seeckt]] (head of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' command from 1920 to 1926) supported an alliance between Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] to invade and partition Poland between them and restore the German-Russian border of 1914.<ref name=\"Christian Leitz p10\">Christian Leitz.

Common Destiny: Dictatorship, Foreign Policy, and War in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Cambridge University Press, 2000. Pp. 125.</ref>\n\nMeetings took place in Berlin in 1924 between Italian General [[Luigi Capello]] and prominent figures in the German military, such as von Seeckt and [[Erich Ludendorff]], over military collaboration between Germany and Italy. The discussions concluded that Germans still wanted a war of revenge against France but were short on weapons and hoped that Italy could assist Germany.<ref>John Gooch.

Pp. 124\"/> Italian foreign minister [[Dino Grandi]] in the early 1930s stressed the importance of \"decisive weight\", involving Italy's relations between France and Germany, in which he recognized that Italy was not yet a major power, but perceived that Italy did have strong enough influence to alter the political situation in Europe by placing the weight of its support onto one side or another.<ref>Gerhard Schreiber, Bern Stegemann, Detlef Vogel. ''Germany and the Second World War''. Oxford University Press, 1995. Pp. 113.</ref> However Grandi stressed that Italy must seek to avoid becoming a \"slave of the rule of three\" in order to pursue its interests, arguing that although substantial Italo-French tensions existed, Italy would not unconditionally commit itself to an alliance with Germany, just as it would neither unconditionally commit itself to an alliance with France over conceivable Italo-German tensions.<ref>Gerhard Schreiber, Bern Stegemann, Detlef Vogel. ''Germany and the Second World War''. Oxford University Press, 1995. P. 113.</ref> Grandi's attempts to maintain a diplomatic balance between France and Germany were challenged in 1932 by pressure from the French, who had begun to prepare an alliance with Britain and the United States against the threat of a revanchist Germany.<ref name=\"burgwyn\">H.

G\u00f6mb\u00f6s responded to Mussolini that as the Austrians primarily identified as Germans, the [[Anschluss]] of Austria to Germany was inevitable, and advised that it would be better for Italy to have a friendly Germany across the [[Brenner Pass]] than a hostile Germany bent on entering the Adriatic.<ref name=\"burgwyn\"/> Mussolini said he hoped the Anschluss could be postponed as long as possible until the breakout of a European war that he estimated would begin in 1938.<ref name=\"burgwyn\"/>\n\n[[File:Adolf Hitler-1933.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adolf Hitler]], ''F\u00fchrer and Reich Chancellor of the German People'', 1933\u20131945]]\nIn 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the Nazi Party [[Machtergreifung|came to power]] in Germany.

Germany needed access to the territory held by Yugoslavia to allow German forces to have a direct route to travel through, to reach and rescue Italian military forces that were faltering in their campaign in Greece. There was substantial animosity towards the alliance amongst Serbs, Yugoslavia's largest ethnic group, who had fought German Austrians and Germany on the side of the Allies in World War I, and three Serb cabinet ministers resigned their positions in protest after the alliance was signed. Hitler initially attempted to be conciliatory to the Serbs who held animosity to the agreement, saying that he \"understood the feelings\" of those Serbs who opposed the alliance. Amidst the negotiations, Hitler expressed concern to Italian foreign minister Ciano that he sensed trouble coming in Belgrade. A coup d'\u00e9tat occurred in Yugoslavia in which a government rose to power and abandoned its association with the Axis. Hitler accused the coup of being engineered by the British. The coup was at least partly supported by the British though there was substantial patriotic enthusiasm against the Pact with rallies in Belgrade. At the rallies in Belgrade immediately after the coup, people were heard to be shouting \"Better war than pact!\" and waving British, American, and French flags.

The pressure of the reparations on the German economy led to [[Inflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation during the early 1920s]]. In 1923 [[Occupation of the Ruhr|the French occupied the Ruhr region]] when Germany defaulted on its reparations payments. Although Germany began to improve economically in the mid-1920s, the [[Great Depression]] created more economic hardship and a rise in political forces that advocated radical solutions to Germany's woes. The Nazis, under Hitler, promoted the nationalist [[stab-in-the-back legend]] stating that Germany had been betrayed by Jews and Communists. The party promised to rebuild Germany as a major power and create a [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]] that would include [[Alsace-Lorraine]], [[Austria]], [[Sudetenland]], and other German-populated territories in Europe. The Nazis also aimed to occupy and colonize non-German territories in [[Poland]], the [[Baltic states]], and the Soviet Union, as part of the Nazi policy of seeking ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") in eastern Europe.\n\nGermany renounced the Versailles treaty and [[remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized the Rhineland]] in March 1936. Germany had already resumed conscription and announced the existence of a German air force, the [[Luftwaffe]], and naval force, the [[Kriegsmarine]] in 1935. Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria in 1938]], the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Sudetenland]] from Czechoslovakia, and the [[Memel territory]] from [[Lithuania]] in 1939. Germany then invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in 1939, creating the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the country of [[Slovakia]].\n\nOn 23 August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], which contained a secret protocol dividing eastern Europe into spheres of influence.{{sfn|Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} Germany's invasion of its part of Poland under the Pact eight days later{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=82}} triggered the beginning of World War II. By the end of 1941, Germany occupied a large part of Europe and [[Wehrmacht|its military forces]] were fighting the Soviet Union, nearly capturing Moscow. However, crushing defeats at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Battle of Kursk]] devastated the German armed forces. This, combined with Western Allied [[Normandy Landings|landings in France]] and [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Italy]], led to a three-front war that depleted Germany's armed forces and resulted in Germany's defeat in 1945.\n\nThere was substantial internal opposition within the German military to the Nazi regime's aggressive strategy of rearmament and foreign policy in the 1930s.<ref>Command Magagzine.

Shortly after Germany annexed the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, Slovakia declared its independence. The new [[Slovak State]] allied itself with Germany. The remainder of the country was occupied by German military forces and organized into the Protectorate. Czech civil institutions were preserved but the Protectorate was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany.\n\nThe [[General Government]] was the name given to the territories of occupied Poland that were not directly annexed into German provinces, but like Bohemia and Moravia was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany.\n\nBelgium quickly surrendered to Germany, and the Belgian King remained in the country during the German military occupation from 1940 to 1944. The Belgian King cooperated closely with Germany and repeatedly sought assurances that Belgian rights would be retained once Germany achieved total victory. However, Hitler intended to annex Belgium and its Germanic population into the Greater Germanic Reich, initiated by the creation of [[Reichskommissariat Belgien]], an authority run directly by the German government that sought the incorporation of the territory into the planned Germanic Reich. However Belgium was soon occupied by Allied forces in 1944.\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Niederlande]] was an occupation authority and territory established in the Netherlands in 1940 designated as a colony to be incorporated into the planned Greater Germanic Reich.\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]] was established in Norway in 1940. Like the Reichskommissariats in Belgium and the Netherlands, its Germanic peoples were to be incorporated into the Greater Germanic Reich. In Norway, the [[Quisling regime]], headed by [[Vidkun Quisling]], was installed by the Germans as a client regime [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|during the occupation]], while king [[Haakon VII]] and the legal [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|government were in exile]]. Quisling encouraged Norwegians to serve as volunteers [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking|in the Waffen-SS]], collaborated in the deportation of Jews, and was responsible for the executions of members of the [[Norwegian resistance movement]].\n\nAbout 45,000 Norwegian collaborators joined the pro-Nazi party ''[[Nasjonal Samling]]'' (National Union), and some police units helped arrest many Jews. However, Norway was one of the first countries where [[resistance during World War II]] was widespread before the turning point of the war in 1943. After the war, [[Legal purge in Norway after World War II|Quisling and other collaborators were executed]]. Quisling's name has become an international [[eponym]] for [[traitor]].\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Ostland]] was established in the Baltic region in 1941. Unlike the western Reichskommissariats that sought the incorporation of their majority Germanic peoples, Ostland were designed for settlement by Germans who would displace the non-Germanic majority living there, as part of ''lebensraum''.\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]] was established in Ukraine in 1941. Like Ostland it was slated for settlement by Germans.\n\nThe [[Military Administration in Serbia]] was established on occupied [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] territory in April 1941, following the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion of the country]]. On 30 April a pro-German Serbian administration was formed under [[Milan A\u0107imovi\u0107]] to serve as a civil administration in the military occupation zone. A joint [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] and [[Chetnik]] uprising in late 1941 became a serious concern for the Germans, as most of their forces were deployed to Russia; only three divisions were in the country. On 13 August 546 Serbs, including some of the country's prominent and influential leaders, issued an appeal to the Serbian nation that condemned the Partisan and royalist resistance as unpatriotic. Two weeks after the appeal, with the Partisan and royalist insurgency beginning to gain momentum, 75 prominent Serbs convened a meeting in Belgrade and formed a [[Government of National Salvation]] under Serbian General [[Milan Nedi\u0107]] to replace the existing Serbian administration. The Germans were short of police and military forces in Serbia, and came to rely on poorly armed Serbian formations, the [[Serbian State Guard]] and [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]], to maintain order. These forces, however, were not able to contain the resistance, and for the most of the war large parts of Serbia were under control of the Partisans or Chetniks (the two resistance movements soon became mutually-hostile). The Government of National Salvation, imbued with few powers upon formation, saw its functions further decreased and taken over by the [[Wehrmacht]] occupation authorities as the war progressed. After the initial mass revolts, the German authorities instituted an extreme regime of reprisals, proclaiming that 100 civilians would be executed for every German soldier killed, and 50 for each one wounded. These measures were actually implemented on more than one occasion: large-scale shootings took place in the Serbian towns of [[Kraljevo massacre|Kraljevo]] and [[Kragujevac massacre|Kragujevac]] during October 1941.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Italy|Italian Empire|Imperial Italy (fascist)|Latin Bloc (proposed alliance)|Military history of Italy during World War II}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-783-0104-09, Nordafrika, italienische Soldaten auf dem Marsch.jpg|thumb|Italian soldiers in the [[North African Campaign]] in 1941]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-783-0104-38, Nordafrika, italienische Panzer M13-40.jpg|thumb|Italian [[Fiat M13/40]] tanks in the North African Campaign in 1941]]\n[[File:Veneto guns at Gaudos.jpg|thumb|Italian battleship ''[[Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]'' firing at Allied warships during the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016230-0008, Bersaglieri in Jugoslawien.jpg|thumb|Italian ''[[Bersaglieri]]'' in the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]]]]\n[[File:Macchi200 m2.jpg|thumb|Italian [[Macchi C.200]] fighter aircraft during the war]]\n\n====War justifications====\n\n''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] described Italy's declaration of war against the Western Allies of Britain and France in June 1940 as the following: \"We are going to war against the [[Plutocracy|plutocratic]] and [[reactionary]] [[Democracy|democracies]] of the [[Western world|West]] who have invariably hindered the progress and often threatened the very existence of the [[Italians|Italian people]]\".<ref>John Whittam.

There was a desire to annex [[Dalmatia]]n territories, which had formerly been ruled by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], and which consequently had Italian-speaking elites. The intention of the Fascist regime was to create a \"[[Italian Empire|New Roman Empire]]\" in which Italy would dominate the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. In 1935\u20131936 [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italy invaded and annexed Ethiopia]] and the Fascist government proclaimed the creation of the \"Italian Empire\".{{sfn|Lowe|Marzari|2002|p=289}} Protests by the [[League of Nations]], especially the British, who had interests in that area, led to no serious action, although The League did try to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident highlighted French and British weakness, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose her as their ally. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany anyway. In 1937 Italy left the League of Nations and joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which had been signed by Germany and Japan the preceding year. In March/April 1939 Italian troops invaded and annexed [[Albania]]. Germany and Italy signed the [[Pact of Steel]] on May 22.\n\nItaly entered World War II on 10 June 1940. In September 1940 Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]].\n\nItaly was ill-prepared for war, in spite of the fact that it had continuously been involved in conflict since 1935, first with Ethiopia in 1935\u20131936 and then in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the side of [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]].{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=40\u201341}} \nMussolini refused to heed warnings from his minister of exchange and currency, Felice Guarneri, who said that Italy's actions in Ethiopia and Spain meant that Italy was on the verge of bankruptcy.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} By 1939 military expenditures by Britain and France far exceeded what Italy could afford.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} As a result of Italy's economic difficulties its soldiers were poorly paid, often being poorly equipped and poorly supplied, and animosity arose between soldiers and class-conscious officers; these contributed to low morale amongst Italian soldiers.<ref>[[Samuel W.

Power over the military was overcentralized to Mussolini's direct control; he personally undertook to direct the ministry of war, the navy, and the air force.

By March 1940, Mussolini decided that Italy would intervene, but the date was not yet chosen. His senior military leadership unanimously opposed the action because Italy was unprepared. No raw materials had been stockpiled and the reserves it did have would soon be exhausted, Italy's industrial base was only one-tenth of Germany's, and even with supplies the Italian military was not organized to provide the equipment needed to fight a modern war of a long duration. An ambitious rearmament program was impossible because of Italy's limited reserves in gold and foreign currencies and lack of raw materials. Mussolini ignored the negative advice.<ref>Stephen L. W.

Initially, the Italians intended that Montenegro would become an \"independent\" state closely allied with Italy, reinforced through the strong dynastic links between Italy and Montenegro, as [[Elena of Montenegro|Queen Elena of Italy]] was a daughter of the last Montenegrin king [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nicholas I]]. The Italian-backed Montenegrin nationalist [[Sekula Drljevi\u0107]] and his followers attempted to create a Montenegrin state. On 12 July 1941, they proclaimed the \"Kingdom of Montenegro\" under the protection of Italy. In less than 24 hours, that triggered a [[Uprising in Montenegro (1941)|general uprising against the Italians]]. Within three weeks, the insurgents managed to capture almost all the territory of Montenegro. Over 70,000 Italian troops and 20,000 of [[Albanian Kingdom (1939\u201343)|Albanian]] and [[Sand\u017eak Muslim militia|Muslim]] irregulars were deployed to suppress the rebellion. Drljevic was expelled from Montenegro in October 1941. Montenegro then came under full direct Italian control.

Under the emperor were a political cabinet and the [[Imperial General Headquarters]], with two chiefs of staff. By 1945 the Emperor of Japan was more than a symbolic leader; he played a major role in devising a strategy to keep himself on the throne.<ref>Herbert P. Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'' (2001) ch 13</ref>\n\nAt its peak, Japan's [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] included [[Manchuria]], [[Inner Mongolia]], large parts of [[China]], [[Malaysia]], [[French Indochina]], [[Dutch East Indies]], [[The Philippines]], [[Burma]], a small part of India, and various Pacific Islands in the central Pacific.\n\nAs a result of the internal discord and economic downturn of the 1920s, militaristic elements set Japan on a path of expansionism. As the Japanese home islands lacked natural resources needed for growth, Japan planned to establish hegemony in Asia and become self-sufficient by acquiring territories with abundant natural resources. Japan's expansionist policies alienated it from other countries in the [[League of Nations]] and by the mid-1930s brought it closer to Germany and Italy, who had both pursued similar expansionist policies. Cooperation between Japan and Germany began with the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], in which the two countries agreed to ally to challenge any attack by the Soviet Union.\n\nJapan entered into conflict [[Second Sino-Japanese War|against the Chinese]] in 1937. The Japanese invasion and occupation of parts of China resulted in numerous atrocities against civilians, such as the [[Nanking massacre]] and the [[Three Alls Policy]]. The Japanese also [[Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts|fought skirmishes]] with Soviet\u2013[[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolian]] forces in [[Manchukuo]] in 1938 and 1939. Japan sought to avoid war with the Soviet Union by signing a non-aggression pact with it in 1941.\n\n[[File:Greater Asian Co-prosperity sphere.png|thumb|left|The Empire of Japan (darker red) and territories controlled by Japanese puppet states during the war (lighter red). Thailand (darkest red) cooperated with Japan. All are members of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]].]]\nJapan's military leaders were divided on diplomatic relationships with Germany and Italy and the attitude towards the United States. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] was in favour of war with the United States, but the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] was generally strongly opposed. When [[Prime Minister of Japan]] General [[Hideki Tojo]] refused American demands that Japan withdraw its military forces from China, a confrontation became more likely.{{sfn|Dull|2007|p=5}} War with the United States was being discussed within the Japanese government by 1940.{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275\u2013276}} Commander of the Combined Fleet Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] was outspoken in his opposition, especially after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, saying on 14 October 1940: \"To fight the United States is like fighting the whole world. But it has been decided. So I will fight the best I can. Doubtless I shall die on board {{ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}} [his flagship]. Meanwhile Tokyo will be burnt to the ground three times. Konoe and others will be torn to pieces by the revengeful people, I [shouldn't] wonder. \"{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275\u2013276}} In October and November 1940, Yamamoto communicated with Navy Minister Oikawa, and stated, \"Unlike the pre-Tripartite days, great determination is required to make certain that we avoid the danger of going to war. \"{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275\u2013276}}\n\nWith the European powers focused on the war in Europe, Japan sought to acquire their colonies. In 1940 Japan responded to the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]] by occupying [[French Indochina]]. The [[Vichy France]] regime, a ''de facto'' ally of Germany, accepted the takeover. The allied forces did not respond with war. However, the United States instituted an embargo against Japan in 1941 because of the continuing war in China. This cut off Japan's supply of scrap metal and oil needed for industry, trade, and the war effort.\n\nTo isolate the US forces stationed in the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]] and to reduce US naval power, the [[Imperial General Headquarters]] ordered [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|an attack]] on the US naval base at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, on 7 December 1941. They also invaded [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. Initially achieving a series of victories, by 1943 the Japanese forces were driven back towards the home islands. The [[Pacific War]] lasted until the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945. The Soviets formally declared war in August 1945 and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|engaged Japanese forces]] in Manchuria and northeast China.\n\n====Colonies and dependencies====\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Indonesische jongens tijdens hun soldatentraining door de Japanners TMnr 10001989.jpg|thumb|Japanese officers training Indonesian recruits]]\nTaiwan, then known as Formosa, was a Japanese dependency established in 1895.\n\nKorea was a Japanese protectorate and dependency formally established by the [[Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1910]].\n\nThe [[South Pacific Mandate]] were territories granted to Japan in 1919 in the peace agreements of World War I, that designated to Japan the German South Pacific islands. Japan received these as a reward by the Allies of World War I, when Japan was then allied against Germany.\n\nJapan occupied the [[Dutch East Indies]] during the war. Japan planned to transform these territories into a client state of [[Indonesia]] and sought alliance with Indonesian nationalists including future Indonesian President [[Sukarno]], however these efforts did not deliver the creation of an Indonesian state until after Japan's surrender.<ref>Li Narangoa, R.

P15-16.</ref>\n\n==Subsequent signatories of the Tripartite Pact==\nIn addition to the 3 major Axis powers, 4 more countries and 2 puppet regimes signed the Tri-Partite Pact as its member states. Of the 4 countries, Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria participated in various Axis military operations with their national armed forces, while the 4th, Yugoslavia, saw its pro-Nazi government overthrown in a coup merely days after it signed the Pact, and the membership was reversed.\n\nThe 2 puppet regimes that signed the Tri-Partite Pact, Tiso-led Slovakia and the Independent State of Croatia are listed among the client states section below.\n\n===Bulgaria===\n{{Main|Military history of Bulgaria during World War II}}\n[[File:Bulgarian army 1941.jpg|thumb|Bulgarian soldiers in [[Vardar Macedonia]] during the Balkans campaign]]\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] was ruled by [[Boris III of Bulgaria|\u0422sar Boris III]] when it signed the Tripartite Pact on 1 March 1941. Bulgaria had been on the losing side in the First World War and sought a return of lost ethnically and historically Bulgarian territories, specifically in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]] (all within [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]] and [[Turkey]]). During the 1930s, because of traditional right-wing elements, Bulgaria drew closer to Nazi Germany. In 1940 Germany pressured Romania to sign the [[Treaty of Craiova]], returning to Bulgaria the region of [[Southern Dobrudja]], which it had lost in 1913. The Germans also promised Bulgaria \u2014 if it joined the Axis \u2014 an enlargement of its territory to the borders specified in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]].\n\nBulgaria participated in the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] and Greece by letting German troops attack from its territory and sent troops to Greece on April 20. As a reward, the Axis powers allowed Bulgaria to occupy parts of both countries\u2014southern and south-eastern Yugoslavia ([[Vardar Banovina]]) and north-eastern Greece (parts of [[Greek Macedonia]] and [[Greek Thrace]]). The Bulgarian forces in these areas spent the following years fighting various nationalist groups and [[resistance movement]]s. Despite German pressure, Bulgaria did not take part in the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]] and actually never declared war on the Soviet Union. The [[Bulgarian Navy]] was nonetheless involved in a number of skirmishes with the Soviet [[Black Sea Fleet]], which attacked Bulgarian shipping.\n\nFollowing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Bulgarian government declared war on the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. This action remained largely symbolic (at least from the Bulgarian perspective), until August 1943, when Bulgarian air defense and air force attacked Allied bombers, returning (heavily damaged) from a mission over the Romanian oil refineries. This turned into a disaster for the citizens of [[Sofia]] and other major Bulgarian cities, which were heavily bombed by the Allies in the winter of 1943\u20131944.\n\nOn 2 September 1944, as the [[Red Army]] approached the Bulgarian border, a new Bulgarian government came to power and sought peace with the Allies, expelled the few remaining German troops, and declared neutrality. These measures however did not prevent the Soviet Union from declaring war on Bulgaria on 5 September, and on 8 September the Red Army marched into the country, meeting no resistance. This was followed by the [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1944|coup d'\u00e9tat of 9 September 1944]], which brought a government of the pro-Soviet [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]] to power. After this, the Bulgarian army (as part of the Red Army's [[3rd Ukrainian Front]]) fought the Germans in Yugoslavia and Hungary, sustaining numerous casualties. Despite this, the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]] treated Bulgaria as one of the defeated countries. Bulgaria was allowed to keep [[Southern Dobruja]], but had to give up all claims to Greek and Yugoslav territory.\n\n===Hungary===\n{{Main|Hungary during World War II|Government of National Unity (Hungary)}}\n[[File:Toldi.jpg|thumb|Hungarian [[Toldi (tank)|Toldi I]] tank as used during the 1941 Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]][[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], ruled by [[Regent]] Admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]], was the first country apart from Germany, Italy, and Japan to adhere to the Tripartite Pact, signing the agreement on 20 November 1940.

P97.</ref>\n\nPolitical instability plagued the country until Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, a Hungarian nobleman and [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian naval]] officer, became regent in 1920. The vast majority of the Hungarians desired to recover territories lost through the [[Trianon Treaty]]. The country drew closer to Germany and Italy largely because of a shared desire to revise the peace settlements made after World War I.{{sfn|Montgomery|2002|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} Many people sympathized with the [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] policy of the Nazi regime. Due to its supportive stance towards Germany and the new efforts in the international policy, Hungary gained favourable territorial settlements by the [[First Vienna Award]], after the breakup of [[Czechoslovakia]] occupied and annexed the remainder of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] and in 1940 received [[Northern Transylvania]] from Romania via the [[Second Vienna Award]]. Hungarians permitted German troops to transit through their territory during the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], and Hungarian forces took part in the invasion. Parts of Yugoslavia were annexed to Hungary; the United Kingdom immediately broke off diplomatic relations in response.\n\nAlthough Hungary did not initially participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], Hungary and the [[Soviet Union]] became belligerents on 27 June 1941. Over 500,000 soldiers served on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. All five of Hungary's field armies ultimately participated in the war against the Soviet Union; a significant contribution was made by the [[Hungarian Second Army]].[[File:Hungarian soldiers in the Carpathians.jpg|thumb|Hungarian soldiers in the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1944]]\n\nOn 25 November 1941, Hungary was one of thirteen signatories to the revived Anti-Comintern Pact. Hungarian troops, like their Axis counterparts, were involved in numerous actions against the Soviets. By the end of 1943, the Soviets had gained the upper hand and the Germans were retreating. The Hungarian Second Army was destroyed in fighting on the [[Voronezh Front]], on the banks of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]]. In 1944, with Soviet troops advancing toward Hungary, Horthy attempted to reach an armistice with the Allies. However, the Germans [[Operation Panzerfaust|replaced the existing regime with a new one]]. After fierce fighting, Budapest was taken by the Soviets. A number of pro-German Hungarians retreated to Italy and Germany, where they fought until the end of the war.\n[[File:Rep\u00fcl\u0151t\u00e9r, 1944. \u00e1prilis 13.

Horthy was forced to abdicate after German commandos, led by Colonel [[Otto Skorzeny]], held his son hostage as part of [[Operation Panzerfaust]].\n\nHungary was reorganized following Horthy's abdication in December 1944 into a totalitarian fascist regime called the [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]], led by [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]]. He had been Prime Minister of Hungary since October 1944 and was leader of the anti-Semitic fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]]. In power, his government was a puppet regime with little authority, and the country was effectively under German control. Days after the Sz\u00e1lasi government took power, the capital of [[Budapest]] was surrounded by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. German and Hungarian fascist forces tried to hold off the Soviet advance but failed. In March 1945, Sz\u00e1lasi fled to Germany as the leader of a government in exile, until the surrender of Germany in May 1945.\n\n===Romania===\n{{Main|Romania in World War II|Romanian Navy during World War II}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B03212, M\u00fcnchen, Staatsbesuch Jon Antonescu bei Hitler.jpg|thumb|Ion Antonescu and [[Adolf Hitler]] at the ''[[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Theater M\u00fcnchen|F\u00fchrerbau]]'' in [[Munich]] (June 1941)]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-218-0501-27, Russland-S\u00fcd, rum\u00e4nische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|right|Romanian soldiers on the outskirts of Stalingrad during the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942]]\n[[File:IAR80.jpg|thumb|right|A formation of Romanian [[IAR80]] fighter aircraft]]\n\nWhen war erupted in Europe in 1939, the [[Kingdom of Romania]] was pro-British and allied to the [[Polish-Romanian alliance|Poles]].

From late 1940 Hitler sought a non-aggression pact with Yugoslavia. In February 1941, Hitler called for Yugoslavia's accession to the Tripartite Pact, the Yugoslav delayed.  In March, divisions of the German army arrived at the Bulgarian-Yugoslav border and permission was sought for them to pass through to attack Greece. On 25 March 1941, fearing that Yugoslavia would be invaded otherwise, the Yugoslav government signed the Tripartite Pact with significant reservations. Unlike other Axis powers, Yugoslavia was not obliged to provide military assistance, nor to provide its territory for Axis to move military forces during the war. Less than two days later, after demonstrations in the streets of Belgrade, Prince Paul and the government were removed from office by a [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Seventeen-year-old [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]] was declared to be of age. The new Yugoslav government under General [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]], refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, and started negotiations with Great Britain and Soviet Union. Winston Churchill commented that \"Yugoslavia has found its soul\"; however, Hitler invaded and quickly took control.\n\n==Co-belligerent state combatants==\nVarious countries fought side by side with the Axis powers for a common cause. These countries were not signatories of the Tripartite Pact and thus not formal members of the Axis.\n\n===Finland===\n{{Main|Military history of Finland during World War II}}\n\nAlthough Finland never signed the Tripartite Pact and legally ''(de jure)'' was not a part of the Axis, it was Axis-aligned in its fight against the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=134}} Finland signed the revived Anti-Comintern Pact of November 1941.<ref>Kent Forster, \"Finland's Foreign Policy 1940-1941: An Ongoing Historiographic Controversy,\" ''Scandinavian Studies'' (1979) 51#2 pp 109-123</ref>\n\nThe August 1939 Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union contained a secret protocol dividing much of eastern Europe and assigning Finland to the Soviet sphere of influence.{{sfn|Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939}}{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=120}} After unsuccessfully attempting to force territorial and other concessions on the Finns, the Soviet Union tried to invade Finland in November 1939 during the [[Winter War]], intending to establish a communist puppet government in Finland.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|pp=120\u2013121}}{{sfn|Kennedy-Pipe|1995|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} The conflict threatened Germany's iron-ore supplies and offered the prospect of Allied interference in the region.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=123}} Despite Finnish resistance, a peace treaty was signed in March 1940, wherein Finland ceded some key territory to the Soviet Union, including the [[Karelian Isthmus]], containing Finland's second-largest city, [[Viipuri]], and the critical defensive structure of the [[Mannerheim Line]]. After this war, Finland sought protection and support from the United Kingdom{{sfn|Seppinen|1983|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}}<ref name=\"FOFinland\">British Foreign Office Archive, 371/24809/461-556.</ref> and non-aligned Sweden,{{sfn|Jokipii|1987|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} but was thwarted by Soviet and German actions. This resulted in Finland being drawn closer to Germany, first with the intent of enlisting German support as a counterweight to thwart continuing Soviet pressure, and later to help regain lost territories.\n\nIn the opening days of Operation Barbarossa, Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, Finland permitted German planes returning from mine dropping runs over [[Kronstadt]] and [[Neva River]] to refuel at Finnish airfields before returning to bases in [[East Prussia]]. In retaliation, the Soviet Union launched a major air offensive against Finnish airfields and towns, which resulted in a Finnish declaration of war against the Soviet Union on 25 June 1941. The Finnish conflict with the Soviet Union is generally referred to as the [[Continuation War]].\n\n[[File:Hitler Mannerheim 2.jpg|upright|thumb| [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Mannerheim]] with Hitler]]\nFinland's main objective was to regain territory lost to the Soviet Union in the Winter War. However, on 10 July 1941, Field Marshal [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] issued an [[Order of the Day]] that contained a formulation understood internationally as a Finnish territorial interest in Russian [[Karelia]].\n\nDiplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Finland were severed on 1 August 1941, after the British bombed German forces in the Finnish village and port of [[Pechenga (urban-type settlement), Murmansk Oblast|Petsamo]]. The United Kingdom repeatedly called on Finland to cease its offensive against the Soviet Union, and declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941, although no other military operations followed. War was never declared between Finland and the United States, though relations were severed between the two countries in 1944 as a result of the [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement]].\n[[File:Tali-Ihantala.jpg|left|thumb|Finnish troops passing by the remains of a destroyed Soviet T-34 at the [[battle of Tali-Ihantala]]]]\nFinland maintained command of its armed forces and pursued war objectives independently of Germany. Germans and Finns did work closely together during [[Operation Silverfox]], a joint offensive against Murmansk. Finland refused German requests to participate actively in the [[Siege of Leningrad]], and also granted asylum to Jews, while Jewish soldiers continued to serve in its army.\n\nThe relationship between Finland and Germany more closely resembled an alliance during the six weeks of the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement, which was presented as a German condition for help with munitions and air support, as the [[Fourth strategic offensive|Soviet offensive coordinated with D-Day]] threatened Finland with complete occupation. The agreement, signed by President [[Risto Ryti]] but never ratified by the Finnish Parliament, bound Finland not to seek a separate peace.\n\nAfter Soviet offensives were fought to a standstill, Ryti's successor as president, Marshall Mannerheim, dismissed the agreement and opened secret negotiations with the Soviets, which resulted in a ceasefire on 4 September and the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September 1944. Under the terms of the armistice, Finland was obliged to expel German troops from Finnish territory, which resulted in the [[Lapland War]]. Finland signed a [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|peace treaty]] with the Allied powers in 1947.\n\n===Free City of Danzig===\n{{Main|Free City of Danzig}}\nThe [[Free City of Danzig]], a semi-autonomous city-state under League of Nations protection, briefly aided the Nazis at the beginning of the [[invasion of Poland]], attacking Polish territories bordering the city.

Seizing power on 1 April 1941, the nationalist government of [[Prime Minister of Iraq|Prime Minister]] [[Rashid Ali]] repudiated the [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty (1930)|Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930]] and demanded that the British abandon their military bases and withdraw from the country. Ali sought support from Germany and Italy in expelling British forces from Iraq.\n\nOn 9 May 1941, [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], the [[Mufti]] of [[Jerusalem]] and associate of Ali, declared holy war{{sfn|Jab\u0101rah|1985|p=183}} against the British and called on Arabs throughout the Middle East to rise up against British rule. On 25 May 1941, the Germans stepped up offensive operations in the Middle East.\n\nHitler issued [[F\u00fchrer Directive No. 30|Order 30]]: \"The Arab Freedom Movement in the Middle East is our natural ally against England.

The Germans and Italians dispatched aircraft and aircrew to Iraq utilizing Vichy French bases in Syria, which would later invoke fighting between [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|Allied and Vichy French forces in Syria]].\n\nThe Germans planned to coordinate a combined German-Italian offensive against the British in Egypt, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and Iraq. Iraqi military resistance ended by 31 May 1941. Rashid Ali and the Mufti of Jerusalem fled to Iran, then Turkey, Italy, and finally Germany, where Ali was welcomed by Hitler as head of the Iraqi [[government-in-exile]] in Berlin. In propaganda broadcasts from Berlin, the Mufti continued to call on Arabs to rise up against the British and aid German and Italian forces. He also helped recruit [[Muslim]] volunteers in the Balkans for the ''[[Waffen-SS]]''.\n\n===Thailand===\n{{See also|Thailand in World War II}}\n[[File:Plaek Pibulsonggram said Chulalongkorn university student on 8 October 1940.jpg|thumb|right|[[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] gave [[ultranationalist]] speech to the crowds at the [[Grand Palace]] in 1940.]]\n\n[[Thailand]] waged the [[Franco-Thai War]] in October 1940 to May 1941 to reclaim territory from [[French Indochina]]. It became a formal ally of Japan from 25 January 1942. Japanese forces [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|invaded Thailand's territory]] an hour and a half before the attack on Pearl Harbor (because of the International Dateline, the local time was on the morning of 8 December 1941). Only hours after the invasion, Prime Minister Field Marshal [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram|Phibunsongkhram]] ordered the cessation of resistance against the Japanese. On 21 December 1941, a military alliance with Japan was signed and on 25 January 1942, [[Sang Phathanothai]] read over the radio Thailand's formal declaration of war on the United Kingdom and the United States. The Thai ambassador to the United States, [[Mom Rajawongse]] [[Seni Pramoj]], did not deliver his copy of the declaration of war. Therefore, although the British reciprocated by declaring war on Thailand and considered it a hostile country, the United States did not.\n\nThe Thais and Japanese agreed that [[Shan State]] and [[Kayah State]] were to be under Thai control. The rest of Burma was to be under Japanese control. On 10 May 1942, the Thai [[Phayap Army]] entered Burma's eastern Shan State, which had been claimed by Siamese kingdoms. Three Thai infantry and one cavalry division, spearheaded by armoured reconnaissance groups and supported by the air force, engaged the retreating Chinese 93rd Division. [[Kengtung]], the main objective, was captured on 27 May. Renewed offensives in June and November saw the Chinese retreat into [[Yunnan]].<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027105102/http://geocities.com/thailandwwii/shans.html |archivedate=2009-10-27|url=http://geocities.com/thailandwwii/shans.html |title=Thailand and the Second World War }}</ref> The area containing the Shan States and Kayah State was annexed by Thailand in 1942. The areas were ceded back to [[Burma]] in 1945.\n\nThe [[Free Thai Movement]] (\"Seri Thai\") was established during these first few months. Parallel Free Thai organizations were also established in the United Kingdom. Queen [[Rambai Barni]] was the nominal head of the British-based organization, and [[Pridi Banomyong]], the regent, headed its largest contingent, which was operating within Thailand. Aided by elements of the military, secret airfields and training camps were established, while [[Office of Strategic Services]] and [[Force 136]] agents slipped in and out of the country.\n\nAs the war dragged on, the Thai population came to resent the Japanese presence. In June 1944, Phibun was overthrown in a coup d'\u00e9tat. The new civilian government under [[Khuang Aphaiwong]] attempted to aid the resistance while maintaining cordial relations with the Japanese. After the war, U. S. influence prevented Thailand from being treated as an Axis country, but the British demanded three million tons of rice as reparations and the return of areas annexed from [[British Malaya|Malaya]] during the war. Thailand also returned the portions of British Burma and French Indochina that had been annexed. Phibun and a number of his associates were put on trial on charges of having committed war crimes and of collaborating with the Axis powers. However, the charges were dropped due to intense public pressure. Public opinion was favorable to Phibun, as he was thought to have done his best to protect Thai interests.\n\n==Client states==\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\n\n===German===\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\nThe collaborationist administrations of German-occupied countries in Europe had varying degrees of autonomy, and not all of them qualified as fully recognized [[sovereign state]]s. The [[General Government]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]] was a German administration, not a Polish government. In [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupied Norway]], the [[Quisling regime|National Government]] headed by [[Vidkun Quisling]] \u2013 whose name [[Quisling|came to symbolize pro-Axis collaboration]] in several languages \u2013 was subordinate to the [[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]]. It was never allowed to have any armed forces, be a recognized military partner, or have autonomy of any kind. In [[History of the Netherlands (1939\u20131945)|the occupied Netherlands]], [[Anton Mussert]] was given the symbolic title of \"F\u00fchrer of the Netherlands' people\". His [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|National Socialist Movement]] formed a cabinet assisting the German administration, but was never recognized as a real Dutch government. The following list of German client states includes only those entities that were officially{{who|date=March 2020}} considered to be independent countries allied with Germany. They were under varying degrees of German influence and control, but were not ruled directly by Germans.\n\n====Albania (under German control)====\n{{Main|Albanian Kingdom (1943\u20131944)}}\nAfter the Italian armistice, a vacuum of power opened up in [[Albania under Italy|Albania]]. The Italian occupying forces were rendered largely powerless, as the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Movement]] took control of the south and the National Front ([[Balli Komb\u00ebtar]]) took control of the north. Albanians in the Italian army joined the guerrilla forces. In September 1943 the guerrillas moved to take the capital of [[Tirana]], but German paratroopers dropped into the city. Soon after the battle, the German High Command announced that they would recognize the independence of a [[greater Albania]]. They organized an Albanian government, police, and military in collaboration with the Balli Komb\u00ebtar. The Germans did not exert heavy control over Albania's administration, but instead attempted to gain popular appeal by giving their political partners what they wanted. Several Balli Komb\u00ebtar leaders held positions in the regime. The joint forces incorporated Kosovo, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, and Presevo into the Albanian state. A High Council of Regency was created to carry out the functions of a head of state, while the government was headed mainly by Albanian conservative politicians. Albania was the only European country occupied by the Axis powers that ended World War II with a larger Jewish population than before the war.{{sfn|Sarner|1997|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} The Albanian government had refused to hand over their Jewish population.

The Government of National Salvation was evacuated from Belgrade to [[Kitzb\u00fchel]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in the first week of October 1944 before the German withdrawal from Serbia was complete.\n\nRacial laws were introduced in all occupied territories with immediate effects on Jews and Roma people, as well as causing the imprisonment of those opposed to Nazism. Several concentration camps were formed in Serbia and at the 1942 Anti-Freemason Exhibition in Belgrade the city was pronounced to be free of Jews (Judenfrei). On 1 April 1942, a Serbian Gestapo was formed. An estimated 120,000 people were interned in German-run concentration camps in Nedi\u0107's Serbia between 1941 and 1944. 50,000 to 80,000 were killed during this period. Serbia became the second country in Europe, following Estonia, to be proclaimed Judenfrei (free of Jews). Approximately 14,500 Serbian Jews \u2013 90 percent of Serbia's Jewish population of 16,000 \u2013 were murdered in World War II.\n\nCollaborationist armed formations forces were involved, either directly or indirectly, in the mass killings of Jews, Roma and those Serbs who sided with any anti-German resistance or were suspects of being a member of such. These forces were also responsible for the killings of many Croats and Muslims; however, some Croats who took refuge in Nedi\u0107's Serbia were not discriminated against. After the war, the Serbian involvement in many of these events and the issue of Serbian collaboration were subject to historical revisionism by later public figures.\n\nNedi\u0107 himself was captured by the Americans when they occupied the former territory of Austria, and was subsequently handed over to the Yugoslav communist authorities to act as a witness against war criminals, on the understanding he would be returned to American custody to face trial by the Allies. The Yugoslav authorities refused to return Nedi\u0107 to United States custody. He died on 4 February 1946 after either jumping or falling out of the window of a Belgrade hospital, under circumstances which remain unclear.\n\n====Italy (Italian Social Republic)====\n{{Main|Italian Social Republic}}\n[[File:Italian social republic map.png|thumb|Italian Social Republic]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-311-0926-07, Italien, italienische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|left|RSI ([[Italian Social Republic|Repubblica Sociale Italiana]]) soldiers, March 1944]]\n\nItalian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]] formed the Italian Social Republic (''Repubblica Sociale Italiana'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) on 23 September 1943, succeeding the Kingdom of Italy as a member of the Axis.\n\nMussolini had been removed from office and arrested by King Victor Emmanuel III on 25 July 1943. After the Italian armistice, in a [[Gran Sasso raid|raid]] led by German paratrooper [[Otto Skorzeny]], Mussolini was rescued from arrest.\n\nOnce restored to power, Mussolini declared that Italy was a [[republic]] and that he was the new head of state.

Slovakia entered into a treaty of protection with Germany on 23 March 1939.\n\nSlovak troops joined the German invasion of Poland, having interest in [[Spi\u0161]] and [[Orava (region)|Orava]]. Those two regions, along with [[Cieszyn Silesia]], had been [[Polish-Czechoslovak border conflicts|disputed]] between Poland and Czechoslovakia since 1918. The Poles fully annexed them following the [[Munich Agreement]]. After the invasion of Poland, Slovakia reclaimed control of those territories.\n[[File:Andrzeja Olejko S\u0142owackie epizody z polskiego Podkarpacia Sanok 39.jpg|thumb|Slovak troops led by General [[Ferdinand \u010catlo\u0161]] (center) pose with a statue of [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]] in [[Sanok]] during the Invasion of Poland.]]\nSlovakia invaded Poland alongside German forces, contributing 50,000 men at this stage of the war.\n\nSlovakia declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941 and signed the revived Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941. Slovak troops fought on Germany's Eastern Front, furnishing Germany with two divisions totaling 80,000 men. Slovakia declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States in 1942.\n\nSlovakia was spared German military occupation until the [[Slovak National Uprising]], which began on 29 August 1944, and was almost immediately crushed by the Waffen SS and Slovak troops loyal to Josef Tiso.\n\nAfter the war, Tiso was executed and Slovakia once again became part of Czechoslovakia. The border with Poland was shifted back to the pre-war state. Slovakia and the Czech Republic finally separated into independent states in 1993.\n\n===Italian===\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\nItaly occupied several nations and set up clients in those regions to carry out administrative tasks and maintain order.\n\n====Monaco====\nThe [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] was officially neutral during the war. The population of the country was largely of Italian descent and sympathized with Italy. Its prince was a close friend of the Vichy French leader, Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, an Axis collaborator. A fascist regime was established under the nominal rule of the prince when the Italian Fourth Army occupied the country on November 10, 1942 as a part of [[Case Anton]]. Monaco's military forces, consisting primarily of police and palace guards, collaborated with the Italians during the occupation.

On 16 April 1941, [[Ante Paveli\u0107]], a Croatian nationalist and one of the founders of the [[Usta\u0161e]] (''\"Croatian Liberation Movement\"''), was proclaimed ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (leader) of the new regime.\n\nInitially the Usta\u0161e had been heavily influenced by Italy. They were actively supported by Mussolini's Fascist regime in Italy, which gave the movement training grounds to prepare for war against Yugoslavia, as well as accepting Paveli\u0107 as an exile and allowing him to reside in Rome. Italy intended to use the movement to destroy Yugoslavia, which would allow Italy to expand its power through the Adriatic. Hitler did not want to engage in a war in the Balkans until the Soviet Union was defeated. The Italian occupation of Greece was not going well; Mussolini wanted Germany to invade Yugoslavia to save the Italian forces in Greece. Hitler reluctantly agreed; Yugoslavia was invaded and the Independent State of Croatia was created. Paveli\u0107 led a delegation to Rome and offered the crown of Croatia to an Italian prince of the House of Savoy, who was crowned ''[[Tomislav II]], King of Croatia, Prince of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Voivode of Dalmatia, [[Tuzla]] and Knin, Prince of [[Cisterna]] and of Belriguardo, Marquess of [[Voghera]], and Count of [[Ponderano]].'' The next day, Paveli\u0107 signed the Contracts of Rome with Mussolini, ceding Dalmatia to Italy and fixing the permanent borders between the NDH and Italy. Italian armed forces were allowed to control all of the coastline of the NDH, effectively giving Italy total control of the Adriatic coastline.\n\nHowever, strong German influence began to be asserted soon after the NDH was founded. When the King of Italy ousted Mussolini from power and Italy capitulated, the NDH became completely under German influence.\n\nThe platform of the Usta\u0161e movement proclaimed that Croatians had been oppressed by the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and that Croatians deserved to have an independent nation after years of domination by foreign empires. The Usta\u0161e perceived Serbs to be racially inferior to Croats and saw them as infiltrators who were occupying Croatian lands. They saw the extermination of Serbs as necessary to racially purify Croatia. While part of Yugoslavia, many Croatian nationalists violently opposed the Serb-dominated Yugoslav monarchy, and assassinated [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]], together with the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]]. The regime enjoyed support amongst radical Croatian nationalists. Ustashe forces fought against communist Yugoslav Partisan guerrilla throughout the war.\n\nUpon coming to power, Paveli\u0107 formed the Croatian Home Guard (''Hrvatsko domobranstvo'') as the official military force of the NDH. Originally authorized at 16,000 men, it grew to a peak fighting force of 130,000. The Croatian Home Guard included an air force and navy, although its navy was restricted in size by the Contracts of Rome. In addition to the Croatian Home Guard, Paveli\u0107 was also the supreme commander of the [[Usta\u0161e militia]], although all NDH military units were generally under the command of the German or Italian formations in their area of operations.\n\nThe Usta\u0161e government declared war on the Soviet Union, signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941, and sent troops to Germany's Eastern Front. Usta\u0161e militia were garrisoned in the Balkans, battling the communist partisans.\n\nThe Usta\u0161e government applied racial laws on Serbs, Jews, [[Romani people]], as well as targeting those opposed to the fascist regime, and after June 1941 deported them to the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] or to German camps in Poland. The racial laws were enforced by the Usta\u0161e militia. The exact number of victims of the Usta\u0161e regime is uncertain due to the destruction of documents and varying numbers given by historians. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, between 320,000 and 340,000 Serbs were killed in the NDH.<ref name=\"US Holocaust Memorial Museum\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20030711191159/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005449 Jasenovac] United States Holocaust Memorial Museum web site</ref>\n\n====Greece (Hellenic State)====\n{{Main|Axis occupation of Greece|Hellenic State (1941\u20131944)}}\n[[File:Greece Prefectures 1941-44.png|thumb|Greece, 1941\u20131944]]\nFollowing the [[Battle of Greece|German invasion]] of Greece and the flight of the [[Greek government in exile|Greek government]] to Crete and then Egypt, the [[Hellenic State (1941-1944)|Hellenic State]] was formed in May 1941 as a puppet state of both Italy and Germany. Initially, Italy had wished to annex Greece, but was pressured by Germany to avoid civil unrest such as had occurred in Bulgarian-annexed areas. The result was Italy accepting the creation of a puppet regime with the support of Germany. Italy had been assured by Hitler of a primary role in Greece. Most of the country was held by Italian forces, but strategic locations ([[Central Macedonia]], the islands of the northeastern Aegean, most of [[Crete]], and parts of [[Attica]]) were held by the Germans, who seized most of the country's economic assets and effectively controlled the collaborationist government. The puppet regime never commanded any real authority, and did not gain the allegiance of the people. It was somewhat successful in preventing secessionist movements like the [[Vlach \"Roman Legion\"]] from establishing themselves. By mid-1943, the [[Greek Resistance]] had liberated large parts of the mountainous interior (\"Free Greece\"), setting up a separate administration there. After the Italian armistice, the Italian occupation zone was taken over by the German armed forces, who remained in charge of the country until their withdrawal in autumn 1944. In some Aegean islands, German garrisons were left behind, and surrendered only after the end of the war.\n\n===Japanese===\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\n{{further|Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere}}\nThe Empire of Japan created a number of client states in the areas occupied by its military, beginning with the creation of Manchukuo in 1932. These puppet states achieved varying degrees of international recognition.\n\n====Burma (Ba Maw regime)====\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of Burma|State of Burma|Burma National Army}}\nThe Japanese Army and Burma nationalists, led by [[Aung San]], seized control of Burma from the United Kingdom during 1942. A [[State of Burma]] was formed on 1 August under the Burmese nationalist leader [[Ba Maw]]. The Ba Maw regime established the Burma Defence Army (later renamed the [[Burma National Army]]), which was commanded by [[Aung San]].\n\n====Cambodia====\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of Cambodia}}\nThe [[Colonial Cambodia#Emergence of Khmer nationalism|Kingdom of Cambodia]] was a short-lived Japanese puppet state that lasted from 9 March 1945 to 15 August 1945.\n\nThe Japanese entered Cambodia in mid-1941, but allowed Vichy French officials to remain in administrative posts. The Japanese calls for an \"Asia for the Asiatics\" won over many Cambodian nationalists.\n\nThis policy changed during the last months of the war. The Japanese wanted to gain local support, so they dissolved French colonial rule and pressured Cambodia to declare its independence within the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. Four days later, King [[Norodom Sihanouk|Sihanouk]] declared Kampuchea (the original [[Khmer language|Khmer]] pronunciation of Cambodia) independent. Co-editor of the ''Nagaravatta'', [[Son Ngoc Thanh]], returned from Tokyo in May and was appointed foreign minister.\n\nOn the date of Japanese surrender, a new government was proclaimed with Son Ngoc Thanh as prime minister. When the Allies occupied [[Phnom Penh]] in October, Son Ngoc Thanh was arrested for collaborating with the Japanese and was exiled to France. Some of his supporters went to northwestern Cambodia, which had been under Thai control since the [[French-Thai War]] of 1940, where they banded together as one faction in the [[Khmer Issarak]] movement, originally formed with Thai encouragement in the 1940s.\n\n====China (Reorganized National Government of China)====\n{{Main|Wang Jingwei regime}}\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Japan advanced from its bases in Manchuria to occupy much of East and Central China. Several Japanese puppet states were organized in areas occupied by the Japanese Army, including the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1937\u20131940)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] at [[Beijing]], which was formed in 1937, and the [[Reformed Government of the Republic of China]] at Nanjing, which was formed in 1938. These governments were merged into the [[Reorganized National Government of China]] at Nanjing on 29 March 1940. [[Wang Jingwei]] became head of state. The government was to be run along the same lines as the Nationalist regime and adopted its symbols.\n\nThe Nanjing Government had no real power; its main role was to act as a propaganda tool for the Japanese. The Nanjing Government concluded agreements with Japan and Manchukuo, authorising Japanese occupation of China and recognising the independence of Manchukuo under Japanese protection. The Nanjing Government signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941 and declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom on 9 January 1943.\n\nThe government had a strained relationship with the Japanese from the beginning. Wang's insistence on his regime being the true Nationalist government of China and in replicating all the symbols of the [[Kuomintang]] led to frequent conflicts with the Japanese, the most prominent being the issue of the regime's flag, which was identical to that of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].\n\nThe worsening situation for Japan from 1943 onwards meant that the Nanking Army was given a more substantial role in the defence of occupied China than the Japanese had initially envisaged. The army was almost continuously employed against the communist [[New Fourth Army]].\n\nWang Jingwei died on 10 November 1944, and was succeeded by his deputy, [[Chen Gongbo]]. Chen had little influence; the real power behind the regime was [[Zhou Fohai]], the mayor of Shanghai. Wang's death dispelled what little legitimacy the regime had. The state stuttered on for another year and continued the display and show of a fascist regime.\n\nOn 9 September 1945, following the defeat of Japan, the area was surrendered to General [[He Yingqin]], a nationalist general loyal to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. The Nanking Army generals quickly declared their alliance to the Generalissimo, and were subsequently ordered to resist Communist attempts to fill the vacuum left by the Japanese surrender. Chen Gongbo was tried and executed in 1946.\n\n====India (Provisional Government of Free India)====\n{{Main|Azad Hind Fauj|Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind}}\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:INA Jubilation.jpg|thumb|[[Indian National Army]] soldiers in Asia]] -->\n\nThe ''Arzi Hukumat-e-[[Azad Hind]]'', the Provisional Government of Free India was a state that was recognized by nine Axis governments. It was led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], an [[Indian nationalist]] who rejected [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]]'s nonviolent methods for achieving independence. The [[First INA]] faltered after its leadership objected to being a propaganda tool for Japanese war aims, and the role of [[I Kikan]]. It was revived by the [[Indian Independence League]] with Japanese support in 1942 after the ex-PoWs and Indian civilians in South-east Asia agreed to participate in the INA venture on the condition it was led by [[Subhash Chandra Bose]]. Bose declared India's independence on October 21, 1943. The Indian National Army was committed as a part of the [[U Go Offensive]]. It played a largely marginal role in the battle, and suffered serious casualties and had to withdraw with the rest of Japanese forces after the [[Battle of Imphal|siege of Imphal]] was broken. It was later committed to the defence of Burma [[Burma Campaign 1944\u201345|against the Allied offensive]]. It suffered a large number of desertions in this latter part. The remaining troops of the INA maintained order in Rangoon after the withdrawal of Ba Maw's government. although The provisional government was given nominal control of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] from November 1943 to August 1945.\n\n====Inner Mongolia (Mengjiang)====\n{{Main|Mengjiang}}\n[[Mengjiang]] was a Japanese puppet state in [[Inner Mongolia]]. It was nominally ruled by Prince [[Demchugdongrub]], a [[Mongol]] nobleman descended from [[Genghis Khan]], but was in fact controlled by the Japanese military. Mengjiang's independence was proclaimed on 18 February 1936, following the Japanese occupation of the region.\n\nThe Inner Mongolians had several grievances against the central Chinese government in Nanking, including their policy of allowing unlimited migration of Han Chinese to the region. Several of the young princes of Inner Mongolia began to agitate for greater freedom from the central government, and it was through these men that Japanese saw their best chance of exploiting Pan-Mongol nationalism and eventually seizing control of Outer Mongolia from the Soviet Union.\n\nJapan created Mengjiang to exploit tensions between ethnic Mongolians and the central government of China, which in theory ruled Inner Mongolia. When the various puppet governments of China were unified under the [[Wang Jingwei]] government in March 1940, Mengjiang retained its separate identity as an autonomous federation. Although under the firm control of the Japanese Imperial Army, which occupied its territory, Prince Demchugdongrub had his own independent army.\n\nMengjiang vanished in 1945 following Japan's defeat in World War II. As Soviet forces advanced into Inner Mongolia, they met limited resistance from small detachments of Mongolian cavalry, which, like the rest of the army, were quickly overwhelmed.\n\n====Laos====\n{{Main|French Protectorate of Laos#Japanese occupation of Laos}}\nFears of Thai irredentism led to the formation of the first Lao nationalist organization, the Movement for National Renovation, in January 1941. The group was led by Prince [[Phetsarath Rattanavongsa|Phetxar\u0101t]] and supported by local French officials, though not by the Vichy authorities in [[Hanoi]]. This group wrote the current [[Pheng Xat Lao|Lao national anthem]] and designed the current [[Flag of Laos|Lao flag]], while paradoxically pledging support for France. The country declared its independence in 1945.\n\nThe liberation of France in 1944, bringing [[Charles de Gaulle]] to power, meant the end of the alliance between Japan and the Vichy French administration in Indochina. The Japanese had no intention of allowing the [[Gaullist]]s to take over, and in March 1945 they staged a military coup in Hanoi. Some French units fled over the mountains to Laos, pursued by the Japanese, who occupied [[Vientiane|Viang Chan]] in March 1945 and [[Luang Prabang|Luang Phrab\u0101ng]] in April. King [[Sisavang Vong|S\u012bsav\u0101ngvong]] was detained by the Japanese, but his son Crown Prince [[Savang Vatthana|Sav\u0101ngvatthan\u0101]] called on all [[Lao people|Lao]] to assist the French, and many Lao died fighting against the Japanese occupiers.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nPrince Phetxar\u0101t opposed this position. He thought that Lao independence could be gained by siding with the Japanese, who made him Prime Minister of Luang Phrab\u0101ng, though not of Laos as a whole. The country was in chaos, and Phetxar\u0101t's government had no real authority. Another Lao group, the Lao S\u0113ri (Free Lao), received unofficial support from the Free Thai movement in the [[Isan]] region.\n\n====Manchuria (Manchukuo)====\n{{Main|Manchukuo}}\n[[File:Military exercise of Manchukuo Imperial Army.JPG|thumb|Manchurian soldiers training in a military exercise]]\n[[File:Manchukuo Air Force.JPG|thumb|Manchurian pilots of the Manchukuo Air Force]]\n\nManchukuo, in the northeast region of China, had been a Japanese puppet state in [[Manchuria]] since the 1930s. It was nominally ruled by [[Puyi]], the last emperor of the [[Qing Dynasty]], but was in fact controlled by the Japanese military, in particular the [[Kwantung Army]]. While Manchukuo ostensibly was a state for ethnic [[Manchu people|Manchus]], the region had a [[Han Chinese]] majority.\n\nFollowing the [[Mukden Incident|Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931, the independence of Manchukuo was proclaimed on 18 February 1932, with Puyi as head of state. He was proclaimed the Emperor of Manchukuo a year later. The new Manchu nation was recognized by 23 of the [[League of Nations]]' 80 members. Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union were among the major powers who recognised Manchukuo. Other countries who recognized the State were the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], and [[Vatican City]]. Manchukuo was also recognised by the other Japanese allies and puppet states, including Mengjiang, the Burmese government of [[Ba Maw]], [[Thailand]], the Wang Jingwei regime, and the Indian government of [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. The League of Nations later declared in 1934 that Manchuria lawfully remained a part of China. This precipitated Japanese withdrawal from the League. The Manchukuoan state ceased to exist after the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] in 1945.\n\n====Philippines (Second Republic)====\n{{main|Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Second Philippine Republic}}\nAfter the [[Battle of Bataan#The Fall of Bataan|surrender]] of the Filipino and American forces in [[Bataan Peninsula]] and [[Corregidor Island]], the Japanese established a puppet state in the Philippines in 1942.<ref>{{cite book |last=Guillermo |first=Artemio R. |title=Historical Dictionary of the Philippines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmgX9M_yETIC&lpg=PA211&dq=Support%20Second%20Republic%20Philippines&pg=PA211#v=onepage&q=Support%20Second%20Republic%20Philippines&f=false |accessdate=22 March 2013 |year=2012 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-7246-2 |pages=211, 621}}</ref> The following year, the [[National Assembly of the Philippines|Philippine National Assembly]] declared the Philippines an [[Second Philippine Republic|independent Republic]] and elected [[Jos\u00e9 P.

This French rule ended on 9 March 1945, when the Japanese officially took control of the government. Soon after, Emperor [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]] voided the 1884 treaty with France and [[Tr\u1ea7n Tr\u1ecdng Kim]], a historian, became prime minister.\n\nThe country suffered through the [[Vietnamese Famine of 1945]].\n\n==Controversial cases==\n{{See also|Foreign relations of the Axis powers}}\n\nStates listed in this section were not officially members of the Axis, but at some point during the war engaged in cooperation with one or more Axis members on level that makes their neutrality disputable.\n\n===Denmark===\n{{Main|Occupation of Denmark }}\n[[File:Flag of Denmark.svg|thumb|[[Kingdom of Denmark]]]]\n\nDenmark was occupied by Germany after April 1940 but never joined the Axis.

In the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Soviet Union gave military aid to the [[Second Spanish Republic]], against [[Spanish State|Spanish Nationalist]] forces, which were assisted by Germany and Italy. However, the Nationalist forces were victorious. The Soviets suffered another political defeat when their ally Czechoslovakia was partitioned and taken over by Germany in 1938\u201339. In 1938 and 1939, the USSR fought and defeated Japan in two separate border conflicts, at [[Battle of Lake Khasan|Lake Khasan]] and [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]]. The latter was a major Soviet victory that led the Japanese Army to avoid war with the Soviets and instead call for expansion south.\n\nIn 1939 the Soviet Union considered forming an alliance with either [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Britain and France]] or with Germany.{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=112\u2013120}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=495\u2013496}} When negotiations with Britain and France failed, they turned to Germany and signed the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. Germany was now freed from the risk of war with the Soviets, and was assured a supply of oil. This included a secret protocol whereby the independent countries of [[Poland]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Romania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] were divided into [[spheres of interest]] of the parties.{{sfn|Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} The Soviet Union had been forced to cede the [[Kresy]] (Western [[Belarus]] and Western [[Ukraine]]) to Poland after losing the [[Soviet-Polish War]] of 1919\u20131921, and the Soviet Union sought to re-annex those territories.<ref name=\"Eastern Europe 2004, Pp. 138-139\"/>\n\nOn 1 September, barely a week after the pact had been signed, [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]].

These and other export goods transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories allowed Germany to circumvent the British naval blockade.\n\nIn October and November 1940, [[German\u2013Soviet Axis talks|German-Soviet talks]] about the potential of joining the Axis took place in Berlin.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=58}}{{sfn|Brackman|2001|p=341\u2013343}} [[Joseph Stalin]] later personally countered with a separate proposal in a letter on 25 November that contained several secret protocols, including that \"the area south of [[Batum]] and [[Baku]] in the general direction of the [[Persian Gulf]] is recognized as the center of aspirations of the Soviet Union\", referring to an area approximating present day Iraq and Iran, and a Soviet claim to Bulgaria.{{sfn|Brackman|2001|p=341\u2013343}}{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202\u2013205}} Hitler never responded to Stalin's letter.{{sfn|Donaldson|Nogee|2005|pp=65\u201366}}{{sfn|Churchill|1953|pp=520\u2013521}} Shortly thereafter, Hitler issued a secret directive on the invasion of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202\u2013205}}{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=59}}\n\nGermany ended the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact by invading the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]] on 22 June 1941.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=82}} That resulted in the Soviet Union becoming one of the main members of [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]].\n\nGermany then revived its Anti-Comintern Pact, enlisting many European and Asian countries in opposition to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and Japan remained neutral towards each other for most of the war by the [[Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact]]. The Soviet Union ended the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|by invading Manchukuo]] on 9 August 1945, due to agreements reached at the [[Yalta Conference]] with Roosevelt and Churchill.\n\n===Spain===\n{{Main|Spain in World War II}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L15327, Spanien, Heinrich Himmler bei Franco.jpg|thumb|Front row in order from left to right: [[Karl Wolff]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], [[Francisco Franco]] and Spain's Foreign Minister [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er|Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er]] in Madrid, October 1940.]]\n[[File:Franco-Mussolini-Serrano-1941.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco Franco]] (centre) and Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er (left) meeting with Mussolini (right) in [[Bordighera]], Italy in 1941.

Franco described Spain as a member of the Axis and signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] in 1941 with Hitler and Mussolini. Members of the ruling [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola y de las JONS|Falange]] party in Spain held irredentist designs on [[Gibraltar]].{{sfn|Wylie|2002|p=275}} Falangists also supported Spanish colonial acquisition of [[Tangier]], [[French Morocco]] and northwestern [[French Algeria]].{{sfn|Rohr|2007|p=99}} In addition, Spain held ambitions on former Spanish colonies in Latin America.{{sfn|Bowen|2000|p=59}} In June 1940 the Spanish government approached Germany to propose an alliance in exchange for Germany recognizing Spain's territorial aims: the annexation of the [[Oran]] province of [[Algeria]], the incorporation of all [[Morocco]], the extension of [[Spanish Sahara]] southward to the twentieth parallel, and the incorporation of [[French Cameroons]] into [[Spanish Guinea]].{{sfn|Payne|1987|p=269}} Spain invaded and occupied the [[Tangier]] International Zone, maintaining its occupation until 1945.{{sfn|Payne|1987|p=269}} The occupation caused a dispute between Britain and Spain in November 1940; Spain conceded to protect British rights in the area and promised not to fortify the area.{{sfn|Payne|1987|p=269}} The Spanish government secretly held expansionist plans towards Portugal that it made known to the German government. In a communiqu\u00e9 with Germany on 26 May 1942, Franco declared that Portugal should be annexed into Spain.{{sfn|Preston|1994|p=857}}\n\nFranco had previously won the [[Spanish Civil War]] with the help of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Both were eager to establish another fascist state in Europe.

This was accepted by Hitler and, within two weeks, there were more than enough volunteers to form a division \u2013 the [[Blue Division]] (''Divisi\u00f3n Azul'') under General [[Agust\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz Grandes]].\n\nThe possibility of Spanish intervention in World War II was of concern to the United States, which investigated the activities of Spain's ruling Falange party in Latin America, especially [[Puerto Rico]], where pro-Falange and pro-Franco sentiment was high, even amongst the ruling upper classes.{{sfn|Leonard|Bratzel|2007|p=96}} The Falangists promoted the idea of supporting Spain's former colonies in fighting against American domination.{{sfn|Bowen|2000|p=59}} Prior to the outbreak of war, support for Franco and the Falange was high in the Philippines.{{sfn|Steinberg|2000|p=122}} The [[Falange Exterior]], the international department of the Falange, collaborated with Japanese forces against U.S. and Filipino forces in the [[Philippines]] through the [[Philippine Falange]].{{sfn|Payne|1999|p=538}}\n\n===Vichy France===\n{{main|Vichy France}}\n[[File:France map Lambert-93 with regions and departments-occupation.svg|thumb|France during the war; [[German occupation of France during World War II|Occupied and annexed zones by Germany]] in shades of red, [[Italian occupation of France during World War II|Italian occupation zones]] in shades of green and striped blue, [[zone libre|\"Free zone\"]] in blue.]]\n\nAlthough officially neutral, Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]]'s [[Vichy France|\"Vichy regime\"]] collaborated with the Axis from its creation on 10 July 1940. It retained full control of the [[zone libre|non-occupied part of France]] until November 1942, and a large part of France's [[French colonial empire|colonial empire]], until the colonies gradually fell under [[Free French]] control.\n\nThe German invasion army entered Paris on 14 June 1940, following the [[battle of France]]. P\u00e9tain became the last Prime Minister of the [[French Third Republic]] on 16 June 1940. He sued for peace with Germany and on 22 June 1940, the French government [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|concluded an armistice]] with Hitler and Mussolini, which came into effect at midnight on 25 June. Under the terms of the agreement, Germany [[occupied France|occupied two-thirds]] of France, including Paris. P\u00e9tain was permitted to keep an \"armistice army\" of 100,000 men within the unoccupied southern zone. This number included neither the army based in the [[French colonial empire]] nor the French fleet. In Africa the Vichy regime was permitted to maintain 127,000.{{sfn|Bachelier|2000|p=98}} The French also maintained substantial garrisons at the French-mandated territory of [[Syrian Republic (1930-1958)|Syria]] and [[Greater Lebanon]], the French colony of [[French Madagascar|Madagascar]], and in [[French Somaliland]]. Some members of the Vichy government pushed for closer cooperation, but they were rebuffed by P\u00e9tain. Neither did Hitler accept that France could ever become a full military partner,{{sfn|Paxton|1993}} and constantly prevented the buildup of Vichy's military strength.\n\nAfter the armistice, relations between the Vichy French and the British quickly worsened. Although the French had told Churchill they would not allow their fleet to be taken by the Germans, the British launched several naval attacks, the most notable of which was against [[Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|the Algerian harbour of Mers el-Kebir]] on 3 July 1940. Though Churchill defended his controversial decision to attack the French fleet, the action deteriorated greatly the relations between France and Britain. German propaganda trumpeted these attacks as an absolute betrayal of the French people by their former allies.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25217, Henry Philippe Petain und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|[[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] (left) meeting with Hitler in October 1940.]]\n[[File:Flag of Philippe P\u00e9tain, Chief of State of Vichy France.svg|thumb|Personal flag of Philippe P\u00e9tain, Chief of State of [[Vichy France]].]]\nOn 10 July 1940, P\u00e9tain was given emergency \"full powers\" by a majority vote of the [[French National Assembly]]. The following day approval of the new constitution by the Assembly effectively created the [[French State]] (''l'\u00c9tat Fran\u00e7ais''), replacing the French Republic with the government unofficially called \"Vichy France,\" after the resort town of [[Vichy]], where P\u00e9tain maintained his seat of government. This continued to be recognised as the lawful government of France by the neutral United States until 1942, while the United Kingdom had recognised [[Free France|de Gaulle's government-in-exile in London]]. Racial laws were introduced in France and its colonies and many [[History of the Jews in France|foreign Jews in France]] were deported to Germany. [[Albert Lebrun]], last President of the Republic, did not resign from the presidential office when he moved to [[Vizille]] on 10 July 1940. By 25 April 1945, during P\u00e9tain's trial, Lebrun argued that he thought he would be able to return to power after the fall of Germany, since he had not resigned.<ref>[http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais_archives/la_presidence/la_galerie_des_presidents/iii_eme_republique/albert_lebrun.21008.html Albert Lebrun's biography, French Republic Presidential official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414173559/http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais_archives/la_presidence/la_galerie_des_presidents/iii_eme_republique/albert_lebrun.21008.html |date=April 14, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1940, Vichy France [[invasion of French Indochina|was forced to allow Japan to occupy French Indochina]], a federation of French colonial possessions and protectorates encompassing modern day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The Vichy regime continued to administer them under Japanese military occupation. [[French Indochina]] was the base for the Japanese [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|invasions of Thailand]], [[Malayan Campaign|Malaya]], and [[Dutch East Indies campaign|the Dutch East Indies]]. In 1945, [[geacps|under Japanese sponsorship]], the [[Empire of Vietnam]] and the [[Japanese occupation of Cambodia#Collaborationist Kingdom of Kampuchea|Kingdom of Kampuchea]] were proclaimed as Japanese puppet states.\n\nOn 26 September 1940, de Gaulle [[Battle of Dakar|led an attack by Allied forces on the Vichy port of Dakar]] in [[French West Africa]]. Forces loyal to P\u00e9tain fired on de Gaulle and repulsed the attack after two days of heavy fighting, drawing Vichy France closer to Germany.\n\nDuring the [[Anglo\u2013Iraqi War]] of May 1941, Vichy France allowed Germany and Italy to use air bases in the [[French mandate of Syria]] to support the Iraqi revolt. British and Free French forces attacked later [[Syria-Lebanon campaign|Syria and Lebanon in June\u2013July 1941]], and in 1942 Allied forces [[Battle of Madagascar|took over French Madagascar]]. More and more colonies abandoned Vichy, joining the Free French territories of [[French Equatorial Africa]], [[French Polynesia|Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]] and others who had sided with de Gaulle [[Appeal of 18 June|from the start]].\n\nIn November 1942 Vichy French troops briefly resisted the [[Operation Torch|landing of Allied troops in French North Africa]] for two days, until Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] negotiated a local ceasefire with the Allies. In response to the landings, [[Case Anton|Axis troops invaded]] the non-occupied zone in southern France and ended Vichy France as an entity with any kind of autonomy; it then became a puppet government for the occupied territories.\n\nIn June 1943, the formerly Vichy-loyal colonial authorities in [[French North Africa]] led by [[Henri Giraud]] came to an agreement with the [[Free French]] to merge with their own interim regime with the [[Free France#Creation of the French National Committee (CNF)|French National Committee]] (''Comit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ais National'', CFN) to form a [[provisional government]] in [[Algiers]], known as the [[French Committee of National Liberation]] (''Comit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ais de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale'', CFLN) initially led by Darlan. After his assassination De Gaulle emerged as the uncontested French leader. The CFLN raised more troops and re-organised, re-trained and re-equipped the Free French military, in cooperation with Allied forces in preparation of future operations [[Operation Husky|against Italy]] and the [[Operation Overlord|German Atlantic wall]].\n\nIn 1943 the [[Milice]], a paramilitary force which had been founded by Vichy, was subordinated to the Germans and assisted them in rounding up opponents and Jews, as well as fighting the [[French Resistance]]. The Germans recruited volunteers in units independent of Vichy. Partly as a result of the great animosity of many right-wingers against the pre-war [[Front Populaire]], volunteers joined the German forces in their anti-communist crusade against the USSR. Almost 7,000 joined ''[[Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism|L\u00e9gion des Volontaires Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (LVF) from 1941 to 1944. The LVF then formed the cadre of the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)|Waffen-SS Division ''Charlemagne'']] in 1944\u20131945, with a maximum strength of some 7,500. Both the LVF and the ''Division Charlemagne'' fought on the eastern front.\n\nDeprived of any military assets, territory or resources, the members of the Vichy government continued to fulfil their role as German puppets, being quasi-prisoners in the so-called \"[[Sigmaringen enclave]]\" in a castle in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at the end of the war in May 1945.\n\n==German, Italian and Japanese World War II cooperation==\n===German-Japanese Axis-cooperation===\n{{Main|Germany\u2013Japan relations#Rapprochement, Axis and World War II (1920\u20131945)}}\n{{see also|Germany\u2013Japan industrial co-operation before World War II}}\n\n===Germany's and Italy's declaration of war against the United States===\nOn 7 December 1941, Japan [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the US naval bases in Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii.
