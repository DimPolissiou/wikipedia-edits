One thing that has always been so special about Fun is that we exist as three individuals in music who come together to do something collaborative. We make Fun records when we are super inspired to do so. Currently Nate is working on his first solo album, Andrew is scoring films, and Jack is on tour and working on Bleachers music. The three of us have always followed inspiration wherever it leads us. Sometimes that inspiration leads to Fun music, sometimes it leads to musical endeavors outside of Fun. We see all of it as part of the ecosystem that makes Fun, fun.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ournameisfun.com/post/110131366776/a-message-from-nate-jack-andrew |title=Fun., A Message From Nate, Jack & Andrew |publisher=Ournameisfun.com |accessdate=2015-06-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627151735/http://www.ournameisfun.com/post/110131366776/a-message-from-nate-jack-andrew |archivedate=June 27, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Ruess added, \"You get a little selfish about the songs that you write, and it's really hard to do that in a group setting, where there are two other people, and you have to think about everybody else's feelings.

[[Charles Bourseul]], [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], [[Antonio Meucci]], [[Johann Philipp Reis]], [[Alexander Graham Bell]], and [[Elisha Gray]], amongst others, have all been credited with the telephone's invention. The early history of the telephone became and still remains a confusing morass of [[Cause of action|claims and counterclaims]], which were not clarified by the huge mass of lawsuits to resolve the [[patent]] claims of many individuals and commercial competitors. The Bell and Edison patents, however, were commercially decisive, because they dominated telephone technology and were upheld by court decisions in the United States.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Antonio Meucci.jpg|[[Antonio Meucci]], 1854, constructed telephone-like devices.\nFile:JPReis.jpg|[[Johann Philipp Reis]], 1860, constructed prototype'' 'make-and-break' ''telephones, today called [[Reis telephone]].\nFile:Alexander Graham Bell.jpg| [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was awarded the first U.S. patent for the invention of the telephone in 1876.\nFile:Portrait elisha gray.jpg|[[Elisha Gray]], 1876, designed a telephone using a [[water microphone]] in Highland Park, Illinois.\nFile:Tivadar Puskas.jpg|[[Tivadar Pusk\u00e1s]] proposed the [[telephone exchange|telephone switchboard exchange]] in 1876.\nFile:Thomas_Edison,_1878.jpg|[[Thomas Edison]] invented the [[carbon microphone]] which produced a strong telephone signal.\n</gallery>\n[[File:USPTO Telephone Patent No. 174465.jpg|thumb|The master telephone patent granted to Bell, 174465, March 10, 1876]] \nThe modern telephone is the result of work of many people.<ref>Lewis Coe (1995), \"The Telephone and Its Several Inventors\"</ref> [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was, however, the first to patent the telephone, as an \"apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically\".

However, in Germany [[Johann Philipp Reis]] is seen as a leading telephone pioneer who stopped only just short of a successful device, and as well the [[Italian-American]] inventor and businessman [[Antonio Meucci]] has been recognized by the U.S. House of Representatives for his contributory work on the telephone.<ref>{{cite web|title=H.Res.269 - Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives to honor the life and achievements of 19th-century Italian-American inventor Antonio Meucci, and his work in the invention of the telephone. 107th Congress (2001-2002)|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-resolution/269?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22h.res.269%22%5D%7D|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|accessdate=7 February 2014}}</ref> Several other controversies also surround the question of [[Priority right|priority of invention]] for the telephone.\n\nThe [[Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy]] considers the question of whether Bell and Gray invented the telephone independently and, if not, whether Bell stole the invention from Gray. This controversy is narrower than the broader question of who deserves credit for inventing the telephone, for which there are several claimants.\n\nThe Canadian Parliamentary Motion on Alexander Graham Bell article reviews the controversial June 2002 United States House of Representatives resolution recognizing Meucci's contributions'' <u>'in'</u> ''the invention of the telephone (not'' <u>'for'</u> the invention of the telephone''). The same resolution was not passed in the U.S. Senate, thus labeling the House resolution as \"political rhetoric\". A subsequent ''counter-motion'' was unanimously passed in Canada's Parliament 10 days later which declared Bell its inventor. This webpage examines critical aspects of both the parliamentary motion and the congressional resolution.\n\n=== Telephone exchange ===\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe main users of the electrical telegraph were post offices, railway stations, the more important governmental centers (ministries), stock exchanges, very few nationally distributed newspapers, the largest internationally important corporations, and wealthy individuals.<ref name=\"SidneyMorningHerald-1878.04.19\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=18780419&id=ceVhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dpEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6902,636781 Private Telegraphs], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', credited to ''[[The Times]]'', 19 April 1878, p. 6.</ref> Telegraph exchanges worked mainly on a [[store and forward]] basis. Although telephones devices were in use before the invention of the telephone exchange, their success and economical operation would have been impossible with the [[Model (abstract)|schema]] and structure of the contemporary telegraph systems.\n\nPrior to the invention of the telephone switchboard, pairs of telephones were connected directly with each other, which was primarily useful for connecting a home to the owner's business (They practically functioned as a primitive [[intercom]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Bo Leuf]]|title=Peer to Peer: Collaboration and Sharing Over the Internet|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=2002|page=15|isbn=9780201767322|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YCLxL_aKvMMC&q=%22The+analog+telephone+was+an+early+extension%22&dq=%22The+analog+telephone+was+an+early+extension%22}}</ref> A [[telephone exchange]] provides telephone service for a small area.

While the switchboard could connect as many as sixty-four customers, only two conversations could be handled simultaneously and six connections had to be made for each call.<ref name=\"DofInterior-NPS\" />\n\nThe District Telephone Company of New Haven went into operation with only twenty-one subscribers, who paid $1.50 per month. By 21 February 1878, however, when the first telephone directory was published by the company, fifty subscribers were listed. Most of these were businesses and listings such as physicians, the police, and the post office; only eleven residences were listed, four of which were for persons associated with the company.<ref name=\"DofInterior-NPS\" />\n\nThe New Haven District Telephone Company grew quickly and was reorganized several times in its first years.

Some used [[Water microphone|liquid transmitters]] which soon went out of use. Some were dynamic: their diaphragms vibrated a coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet or vice versa. Such [[sound-powered telephone]]s survived in small numbers through the 20th century in military and maritime applications where the ability to create its own electrical power was crucial. Most, however, used Edison/Berliner carbon transmitters, which were much louder than the other kinds, even though they required [[induction coil]]s, actually acting as [[impedance matching]] transformers to make it compatible to the line impedance. The Edison patents kept the Bell monopoly viable into the 20th century, by which time [[Public switched telephone network|telephone networks]] were more important than the instrument.\n\nEarly telephones were locally powered, using a dynamic transmitter or else powering the transmitter with a [[local battery]]. One of the jobs of [[outside plant]] personnel was to visit each telephone periodically to inspect the battery. During the 20th century, \"[[common battery]]\" operation came to dominate, powered by \"talk battery\" from the telephone exchange over the same wires that carried the voice signals. Late in the century, wireless handsets brought a revival of local battery power.\n\nThe earliest telephones had only one wire for both transmitting and receiving of audio, and used a [[single-wire earth return|ground return]] path, as was found in [[telegraph]] systems. The earliest dynamic telephones also had only one opening for sound, and the user alternately listened and spoke (rather, shouted) into the same hole. Sometimes the instruments were operated in pairs at each end, making conversation more convenient but also more expensive.\n\n[[File:1st Telephone Central Office.jpg|thumb|Historical marker commemorating the first telephone central office in New York State (1878)]]\nAt first, the benefits of a ''switchboard'' exchange were not exploited. Instead, telephones were leased in pairs to the [[subscriber]], for example one for his home and one for his shop, and the subscriber had to arrange with telegraph contractors to construct a line between them. Users who wanted the ability to speak to three or four different shops, suppliers etc. would obtain and set up three or four pairs of telephones. [[Western Union]], already using telegraph exchanges, quickly extended the principle to its telephones in New York City and San Francisco, and Bell was not slow in appreciating the potential.\n\nSignaling began in an appropriately primitive manner. The user alerted the other end, or the exchange operator, by whistling into the transmitter. Exchange operation soon resulted in telephones being equipped with a bell, first operated over a second wire and later with the same wire using a condenser. Telephones connected to the earliest [[Strowger switch|Strowger]] automatic exchanges had seven wires, one for the [[Changeover switch|knife switch]], one for each [[telegraph key]], one for the bell, one for the push button and two for speaking.\n\nRural and other telephones that were not on a common battery exchange had hand cranked \"[[telephone magneto|magneto]]\" generators to produce an alternating current to ring the bells of other telephones on the line and to alert the exchange operator.\n\nIn 1877 and 1878, [[Thomas Edison#Carbon telephone transmitter|Edison invented and developed the carbon microphone]] used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s. After protracted patent litigation, a federal court ruled in 1892 that Edison and not [[Emile Berliner]] was the inventor of the carbon microphone. The carbon microphone was also used in radio broadcasting and public address work through the 1920s.\n\n[[File:1896 telephone.jpg|thumb|1896 Telephone ([[Sweden]])]]\n\nIn the 1890s a new smaller style of telephone was introduced, the [[candlestick telephone]], packaged in three parts. The transmitter stood on a stand, known as a \"candlestick\" for its shape, hence the name. When not in use, the receiver hung on a hook with a switch in it, known as a \"switchhook.\" Previous telephones required the user to operate a separate switch to connect either the voice or the bell. With the new kind, the user was less likely to leave the phone \"off the hook\". In phones connected to magneto exchanges, the bell, induction coil, battery, and magneto were in a separate [[bell box]] called a \"[[ringer box]].\" In phones connected to common battery exchanges, the ringer box was installed under a desk, or other out of the way place, since it did not need a battery or magneto.\n\nCradle designs were also used at this time, having a handle with the receiver and transmitter attached, separate from the cradle base that housed the magneto crank and other parts. They were larger than the \"candlestick\" and more popular.\n\nDisadvantages of single-wire operation, such as [[crosstalk]] and hum from nearby AC power wires, had already led to the use of [[twisted pair]]s and, for [[long-distance telephone]]s, [[four-wire circuit]]s. Users at the beginning of the 20th century did not place [[long-distance call]]s from their own telephones but made an appointment to use a special sound-proofed long-distance [[telephone booth]] furnished with the latest technology.\n\nAround 1893, the country leading the world in telephones per 100 persons (teledensity) was Sweden with 0.55 in the whole country but 4 in Stockholm (10,000 out of a total of 27,658 subscribers).<ref>\n{{cite book|first=Alfred Roslin|last=Bennett|title=Telephone Systems of the Continent of Europe|year=1895|url=https://archive.org/stream/telephonesystems00bennrich#page/332/|page=337|accessdate=14 June 2012|ref=harv}}\n</ref> This compares with 0.4 in the US for that year.<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Early U.S. Telephone Industry Data|url=http://www.galbithink.org/telcos/early-telephone-data.htm|accessdate=15 June 2012}}\n</ref> Telephone service in Sweden developed through a variety of institutional forms: the [[International Bell Telephone Company]] (a U.S. multinational), town and village co-operatives, the General Telephone Company of Stockholm (a Swedish private company), and the Swedish Telegraph Department (part of the Swedish government). Since Stockholm consists of islands, telephone service offered relatively large advantages, but had to use submarine cables extensively. Competition between Bell Telephone and General Telephone, and later between General Telephone and the Swedish Telegraph Dept., was intense.\n\nIn 1893, the U.S. was considerably behind Sweden, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Norway in teledensity. The U.S. became the world leadership in teledensity with the rise of many independent telephone companies after the Bell patents expired in 1893 and 1894.\n\n== 20th-century developments ==\n[[File:OldReciever-ElementsOfElectricity-Pg43.png|thumb|Old Receiver schematic, c.1906]]\n[[File:W48 DBP.jpg|thumb|A German [[rotary dial]] telephone, the [[W48 (telephone)|W48]]]]\n[[File:Transmitting tower top us.jpg|thumb|Top of cellular telephone tower]]\n\nBy 1904, over three million phones in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corp.att.com/history/history1.html |title=AT&T: History: Origins |publisher=Corp.att.com |accessdate=2012-08-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820015455/http://www.corp.att.com/history/history1.html |archivedate=20 August 2012 }}</ref> were connected by manual switchboard exchanges.

A [[carbon microphone|carbon granule transmitter]] and electromagnetic receiver were united in a single molded plastic handle, which when not in use were placed in a cradle in the base unit. The circuit diagram<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.porticus.org/bell/images/we-102.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616083345/http://www.porticus.org/bell/images/we-102.jpg |archive-date=16 June 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> of the model 102 shows the direct connection of the receiver to the line, while the transmitter was induction coupled, with energy supplied by a local battery. The coupling transformer, battery, and ringer were in a separate enclosure from the desk set. The [[rotary dial]] in the base interrupted the line current by repeatedly but very briefly disconnecting the line 1 to 10 times for each digit, and the hook switch (in the center of the circuit diagram) permanently disconnected the line and the transmitter battery while the handset was on the cradle.\n\nStarting in the 1930s, the base of the telephone also enclosed its bell and induction coil, obviating the need for a separate ringer box. Power was supplied to each subscriber line by central-office batteries instead of the user's local battery, which required periodic service. For the next half century, the network behind the telephone grew progressively larger and much more efficient, and, after the rotary dial was added, the instrument itself changed little until [[Touch-Tone]] signaling started replacing the rotary dial in the 1960s.\n\nThe [[history of mobile phones]] can be traced back to two-way radios permanently installed in vehicles such as taxicabs, police cruisers, railroad trains, and the like. Later versions such as the so-called transportables or \"bag phones\" were equipped with a cigarette-lighter plug so that they could also be carried, and thus could be used as either mobile two-way radios or as portable phones by being patched into the telephone network.\n\nIn December 1947, [[Bell Labs]] engineers [[Douglas H. Ring]] and [[W. Rae Young]] proposed hexagonal cell transmissions for mobile phones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.privateline.com/archive/Ringcellreport1947.pdf |title=1947 memo by Douglas H.

Cellular technology was undeveloped until the 1960s, when Richard H. Frenkiel and [[Joel S.

Engel, head of research at AT&T's [[Bell Labs]]. This began the era of the handheld cellular-mobile phone.\n\nCable-television companies began to use their fast-developing cable networks with ducting under the streets of the United Kingdom in the late 1980s to provide telephony services in association with major telephone companies. One of the early cable operators in the UK, [[Cable London]], connected its first cable telephone customer in about 1990.\n\n===Digital telephone technology===\n{{Main|Digital telephony}}\n{{See|Push-button telephone|Speech coding}}\n\nThe rapid development and wide adoption of [[pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) [[digital telephony]] was enabled by [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (MOS) technology.<ref name=\"Allstot\">{{cite book |last1=Allstot |first1=David J. |chapter=Switched Capacitor Filters |editor-last1=Maloberti |editor-first1=Franco |editor-last2=Davies |editor-first2=Anthony C. |title=A Short History of Circuits and Systems: From Green, Mobile, Pervasive Networking to Big Data Computing |date=2016 |publisher=[[IEEE Circuits and Systems Society]] |isbn=9788793609860 |pages=105\u2013110 |url=https://ieee-cas.org/sites/default/files/a_short_history_of_circuits_and_systems-_ebook-_web.pdf}}</ref> The [[MOSFET|MOS field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET) was invented by [[Mohamed M.

[[Charles Bourseul]], [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], [[Antonio Meucci]], [[Johann Philipp Reis]], [[Alexander Graham Bell]], and [[Elisha Gray]], amongst others, have all been credited with the telephone's invention. The early history of the telephone became and still remains a confusing morass of [[Cause of action|claims and counterclaims]], which were not clarified by the huge mass of lawsuits to resolve the [[patent]] claims of many individuals and commercial competitors. The Bell and Edison patents, however, were commercially decisive, because they dominated telephone technology and were upheld by court decisions in the United States.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Antonio Meucci.jpg|[[Antonio Meucci]], 1854, constructed telephone-like devices.\nFile:JPReis.jpg|[[Johann Philipp Reis]], 1860, constructed prototype'' 'make-and-break' ''telephones, today called [[Reis telephone]].\nFile:Alexander Graham Bell.jpg| [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was awarded the first U.S. patent for the invention of the telephone in 1876.\nFile:Portrait elisha gray.jpg|[[Elisha Gray]], 1876, designed a telephone using a [[water microphone]] in Highland Park, Illinois.\nFile:Tivadar Puskas.jpg|[[Tivadar Pusk\u00e1s]] proposed the [[telephone exchange|telephone switchboard exchange]] in 1876.\nFile:Thomas_Edison,_1878.jpg|[[Thomas Edison]] invented the [[carbon microphone]] which produced a strong telephone signal.\n</gallery>\n[[File:USPTO Telephone Patent No. 174465.jpg|thumb|The master telephone patent granted to Bell, 174465, March 10, 1876]] \nThe modern telephone is the result of work of many people.<ref>Lewis Coe (1995), \"The Telephone and Its Several Inventors\"</ref> [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was, however, the first to patent the telephone, as an \"apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically\".

This controversy is narrower than the broader question of who deserves credit for inventing the telephone, for which there are several claimants.\n\nThe Canadian Parliamentary Motion on Alexander Graham Bell article reviews the controversial June 2002 United States House of Representatives resolution recognizing Meucci's contributions'' <u>'in'</u> ''the invention of the telephone (not'' <u>'for'</u> the invention of the telephone''). The same resolution was not passed in the U.S. Senate, thus labeling the House resolution as \"political rhetoric\". A subsequent ''counter-motion'' was unanimously passed in Canada's Parliament 10 days later which declared Bell its inventor. This webpage examines critical aspects of both the parliamentary motion and the congressional resolution.\n\n=== Telephone exchange ===\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe main users of the electrical telegraph were post offices, railway stations, the more important governmental centers (ministries), stock exchanges, very few nationally distributed newspapers, the largest internationally important corporations, and wealthy individuals.<ref name=\"SidneyMorningHerald-1878.04.19\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=18780419&id=ceVhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dpEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6902,636781 Private Telegraphs], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', credited to ''[[The Times]]'', 19 April 1878, p. 6.</ref> Telegraph exchanges worked mainly on a [[store and forward]] basis. Although telephones devices were in use before the invention of the telephone exchange, their success and economical operation would have been impossible with the [[Model (abstract)|schema]] and structure of the contemporary telegraph systems.\n\nPrior to the invention of the telephone switchboard, pairs of telephones were connected directly with each other, which was primarily useful for connecting a home to the owner's business (They practically functioned as a primitive [[intercom]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Bo Leuf]]|title=Peer to Peer: Collaboration and Sharing Over the Internet|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=2002|page=15|isbn=9780201767322|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YCLxL_aKvMMC&q=%22The+analog+telephone+was+an+early+extension%22&dq=%22The+analog+telephone+was+an+early+extension%22}}</ref> A [[telephone exchange]] provides telephone service for a small area.

These made telephony an available and comfortable communication tool for many purposes, and it gave the impetus for the creation of a new industrial sector.\n\nThe telephone exchange was an idea of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] engineer [[Tivadar Pusk\u00e1s]] (1844\u20131893) in 1876, while he was working for [[Thomas Edison]] on a telegraph exchange.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alvin K.

On 3 November 1877, Coy applied for and received a franchise from the [[Bell Telephone Company]] for New Haven and Middlesex Counties. Coy, along with Herrick P. Frost and Walter Lewis, who provided the capital, established the District Telephone Company of New Haven on 15 January 1878.<ref name=\"DofInterior-NPS\" />\n\nThe switchboard built by Coy was, according to one source, constructed of \"carriage bolts, handles from teapot lids and bustle wire.\" According to the company records, all the furnishings of the office, including the switchboard, were worth less than forty dollars. While the switchboard could connect as many as sixty-four customers, only two conversations could be handled simultaneously and six connections had to be made for each call.<ref name=\"DofInterior-NPS\" />\n\nThe District Telephone Company of New Haven went into operation with only twenty-one subscribers, who paid $1.50 per month. By 21 February 1878, however, when the first telephone directory was published by the company, fifty subscribers were listed. Most of these were businesses and listings such as physicians, the police, and the post office; only eleven residences were listed, four of which were for persons associated with the company.<ref name=\"DofInterior-NPS\" />\n\nThe New Haven District Telephone Company grew quickly and was reorganized several times in its first years. By 1880, the company had the right from the [[Bell Telephone Company]] to service all of Connecticut and western Massachusetts. As it expanded, the company was first renamed Connecticut Telephone, and then [[Southern New England Telephone]] in 1882.<ref name=\"DofInterior-NPS\" /> The site of the first telephone exchange was granted a designation as a [[National Historic Landmark]] on 23 April 1965.

Some used [[Water microphone|liquid transmitters]] which soon went out of use. Some were dynamic: their diaphragms vibrated a coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet or vice versa. Such [[sound-powered telephone]]s survived in small numbers through the 20th century in military and maritime applications where the ability to create its own electrical power was crucial. Most, however, used Edison/Berliner carbon transmitters, which were much louder than the other kinds, even though they required [[induction coil]]s, actually acting as [[impedance matching]] transformers to make it compatible to the line impedance. The Edison patents kept the Bell monopoly viable into the 20th century, by which time [[Public switched telephone network|telephone networks]] were more important than the instrument.\n\nEarly telephones were locally powered, using a dynamic transmitter or else powering the transmitter with a [[local battery]]. One of the jobs of [[outside plant]] personnel was to visit each telephone periodically to inspect the battery. During the 20th century, \"[[common battery]]\" operation came to dominate, powered by \"talk battery\" from the telephone exchange over the same wires that carried the voice signals. Late in the century, wireless handsets brought a revival of local battery power.\n\nThe earliest telephones had only one wire for both transmitting and receiving of audio, and used a [[single-wire earth return|ground return]] path, as was found in [[telegraph]] systems. The earliest dynamic telephones also had only one opening for sound, and the user alternately listened and spoke (rather, shouted) into the same hole. Sometimes the instruments were operated in pairs at each end, making conversation more convenient but also more expensive.\n\n[[File:1st Telephone Central Office.jpg|thumb|Historical marker commemorating the first telephone central office in New York State (1878)]]\nAt first, the benefits of a ''switchboard'' exchange were not exploited. Instead, telephones were leased in pairs to the [[subscriber]], for example one for his home and one for his shop, and the subscriber had to arrange with telegraph contractors to construct a line between them. Users who wanted the ability to speak to three or four different shops, suppliers etc. would obtain and set up three or four pairs of telephones. [[Western Union]], already using telegraph exchanges, quickly extended the principle to its telephones in New York City and San Francisco, and Bell was not slow in appreciating the potential.\n\nSignaling began in an appropriately primitive manner. The user alerted the other end, or the exchange operator, by whistling into the transmitter. Exchange operation soon resulted in telephones being equipped with a bell, first operated over a second wire and later with the same wire using a condenser. Telephones connected to the earliest [[Strowger switch|Strowger]] automatic exchanges had seven wires, one for the [[Changeover switch|knife switch]], one for each [[telegraph key]], one for the bell, one for the push button and two for speaking.\n\nRural and other telephones that were not on a common battery exchange had hand cranked \"[[telephone magneto|magneto]]\" generators to produce an alternating current to ring the bells of other telephones on the line and to alert the exchange operator.\n\nIn 1877 and 1878, [[Thomas Edison#Carbon telephone transmitter|Edison invented and developed the carbon microphone]] used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s. After protracted patent litigation, a federal court ruled in 1892 that Edison and not [[Emile Berliner]] was the inventor of the carbon microphone. The carbon microphone was also used in radio broadcasting and public address work through the 1920s.\n\n[[File:1896 telephone.jpg|thumb|1896 Telephone ([[Sweden]])]]\n\nIn the 1890s a new smaller style of telephone was introduced, the [[candlestick telephone]], packaged in three parts. The transmitter stood on a stand, known as a \"candlestick\" for its shape, hence the name. When not in use, the receiver hung on a hook with a switch in it, known as a \"switchhook.\" Previous telephones required the user to operate a separate switch to connect either the voice or the bell. With the new kind, the user was less likely to leave the phone \"off the hook\". In phones connected to magneto exchanges, the bell, induction coil, battery, and magneto were in a separate [[bell box]] called a \"[[ringer box]].\" In phones connected to common battery exchanges, the ringer box was installed under a desk, or other out of the way place, since it did not need a battery or magneto.\n\nCradle designs were also used at this time, having a handle with the receiver and transmitter attached, separate from the cradle base that housed the magneto crank and other parts. They were larger than the \"candlestick\" and more popular.\n\nDisadvantages of single-wire operation, such as [[crosstalk]] and hum from nearby AC power wires, had already led to the use of [[twisted pair]]s and, for [[long-distance telephone]]s, [[four-wire circuit]]s. Users at the beginning of the 20th century did not place [[long-distance call]]s from their own telephones but made an appointment to use a special sound-proofed long-distance [[telephone booth]] furnished with the latest technology.\n\nAround 1893, the country leading the world in telephones per 100 persons (teledensity) was Sweden with 0.55 in the whole country but 4 in Stockholm (10,000 out of a total of 27,658 subscribers).<ref>\n{{cite book|first=Alfred Roslin|last=Bennett|title=Telephone Systems of the Continent of Europe|year=1895|url=https://archive.org/stream/telephonesystems00bennrich#page/332/|page=337|accessdate=14 June 2012|ref=harv}}\n</ref> This compares with 0.4 in the US for that year.<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Early U.S. Telephone Industry Data|url=http://www.galbithink.org/telcos/early-telephone-data.htm|accessdate=15 June 2012}}\n</ref> Telephone service in Sweden developed through a variety of institutional forms: the [[International Bell Telephone Company]] (a U.S. multinational), town and village co-operatives, the General Telephone Company of Stockholm (a Swedish private company), and the Swedish Telegraph Department (part of the Swedish government). Since Stockholm consists of islands, telephone service offered relatively large advantages, but had to use submarine cables extensively. Competition between Bell Telephone and General Telephone, and later between General Telephone and the Swedish Telegraph Dept., was intense.\n\nIn 1893, the U.S. was considerably behind Sweden, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Norway in teledensity. The U.S. became the world leadership in teledensity with the rise of many independent telephone companies after the Bell patents expired in 1893 and 1894.\n\n== 20th-century developments ==\n[[File:OldReciever-ElementsOfElectricity-Pg43.png|thumb|Old Receiver schematic, c.1906]]\n[[File:W48 DBP.jpg|thumb|A German [[rotary dial]] telephone, the [[W48 (telephone)|W48]]]]\n[[File:Transmitting tower top us.jpg|thumb|Top of cellular telephone tower]]\n\nBy 1904, over three million phones in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corp.att.com/history/history1.html |title=AT&T: History: Origins |publisher=Corp.att.com |accessdate=2012-08-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820015455/http://www.corp.att.com/history/history1.html |archivedate=20 August 2012 }}</ref> were connected by manual switchboard exchanges.

The [[rotary dial]] in the base interrupted the line current by repeatedly but very briefly disconnecting the line 1 to 10 times for each digit, and the hook switch (in the center of the circuit diagram) permanently disconnected the line and the transmitter battery while the handset was on the cradle.\n\nStarting in the 1930s, the base of the telephone also enclosed its bell and induction coil, obviating the need for a separate ringer box. Power was supplied to each subscriber line by central-office batteries instead of the user's local battery, which required periodic service. For the next half century, the network behind the telephone grew progressively larger and much more efficient, and, after the rotary dial was added, the instrument itself changed little until [[Touch-Tone]] signaling started replacing the rotary dial in the 1960s.\n\nThe [[history of mobile phones]] can be traced back to two-way radios permanently installed in vehicles such as taxicabs, police cruisers, railroad trains, and the like. Later versions such as the so-called transportables or \"bag phones\" were equipped with a cigarette-lighter plug so that they could also be carried, and thus could be used as either mobile two-way radios or as portable phones by being patched into the telephone network.\n\nIn December 1947, [[Bell Labs]] engineers [[Douglas H. Ring]] and [[W. Rae Young]] proposed hexagonal cell transmissions for mobile phones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.privateline.com/archive/Ringcellreport1947.pdf |title=1947 memo by Douglas H.

Cellular technology was undeveloped until the 1960s, when Richard H. Frenkiel and [[Joel S. Engel]] of Bell Labs developed the electronics.\n\nMeanwhile, the 1956 inauguration of the [[TAT-1]] cable and later [[international direct dialing]] were important steps in putting together the various continental telephone networks into a [[global network]].\n\nOn 3 April 1973, Motorola manager [[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Martin Cooper]] placed a cellular-phone call (in front of reporters) to Dr. Joel S. Engel, head of research at AT&T's [[Bell Labs]]. This began the era of the handheld cellular-mobile phone.\n\nCable-television companies began to use their fast-developing cable networks with ducting under the streets of the United Kingdom in the late 1980s to provide telephony services in association with major telephone companies. One of the early cable operators in the UK, [[Cable London]], connected its first cable telephone customer in about 1990.\n\n===Digital telephone technology===\n{{Main|Digital telephony}}\n{{See|Push-button telephone|Speech coding}}\n\nThe rapid development and wide adoption of [[pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) [[digital telephony]] was enabled by [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (MOS) technology.<ref name=\"Allstot\">{{cite book |last1=Allstot |first1=David J. |chapter=Switched Capacitor Filters |editor-last1=Maloberti |editor-first1=Franco |editor-last2=Davies |editor-first2=Anthony C. |title=A Short History of Circuits and Systems: From Green, Mobile, Pervasive Networking to Big Data Computing |date=2016 |publisher=[[IEEE Circuits and Systems Society]] |isbn=9788793609860 |pages=105\u2013110 |url=https://ieee-cas.org/sites/default/files/a_short_history_of_circuits_and_systems-_ebook-_web.pdf}}</ref> The [[MOSFET|MOS field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET) was invented by [[Mohamed M.

Sydney's paternal grandmother approves of the hairstyle, but Syd's father Max thinks she is too young for such a hairdo, so he declines to take her to a hairstylist. Sydney defies her father and, with help from her friend Olive, tries to implement her new hairstyle without a stylist, but she accidentally turns her hair multiple colors. Max changes his mind and decides to take Sydney to a hairstylist to get her desired hairdo, and Syd keeps her failed hairdo a secret from him by wearing a wig.

Olive gives her a pad and Judy teaches her how to put it on. When she gets an accident at school, she reaches out to Olive, Sophia and Emmy who shield her so that no one sees the blood in her jeans. To avoid such an embarrassment again, Syd wants to sit out her bass solo at the school concert. Sophia visits her and reveals that she has been getting her period too but was too embarrassed to tell anyone. This encourages Syd to embrace her womanhood instead of being controlled by the fear of getting embarrassed. When Sophia accidentally drops her pad before the concert, Sydney and her friends protect her by claiming it's theirs. Sydney then boldly reveals to the audience that she got her period. To her surprise, she is not embarrassed at all.\n\nBack in the past, when young Max accidentally drops his underwear in school, a bully finds it and starts blackmailing him.\n\n''Guest stars'': Julia Garcia as Emmy, Amelia Wray as Sophia, Delila Ali Rajah as Mrs. Richardson, West Mulholland as Jimmy Mason, Thalia Tran as Suzi Harrison\n| LineColor       = FBEC5D\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 28\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n| Title           = Baby One More Rhyme\n| DirectedBy      = Jody Margolin Hahn\n| WrittenBy       = Patrice Asuncion & Nick Rossito\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3}}\n| ProdCode        = 210\n| Viewers         = 0.37<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-3-2020.html|title=Top 150 Friday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.3.2020|work=[[Showbuzz Daily]]|author=[[Mitch Metcalf]]|date=April 6, 2020|access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.

Although it is not Cami's fault, Principal Walker gives her detention, saying that she is not exempt from the rules just because he and Jenna are dating. Being stuck in detention means that Cami will miss her dance competition, and her team will be disqualified without her, so she makes a plan to escape detention. Jenna is also upset at Walker for giving Cami detention, and she happily joins in on Cami's plan upon learning of it. They intend to use a mouse to scare off Mr. Kramsky, who oversees detention and has a fear of mice, but the plan is ruined when Walker fills in for Kramsky. Instead, Coop puts on a wig and switches places with Cami, allowing her to compete in the dance competition, although Walker eventually finds out about the scheme. Meanwhile, Fred learns that Neve has started spending time with a professional skateboarder named Ty. Desperate to win Neve back, Fred dresses up like a skateboarder to get her attention, but Charlotte convinces him that he should be himself instead. Fred tells Neve that he will work to improve himself and become a trustworthy person.\n\n''Guest stars'': Kevin Daniels as Principal Walker, Trinitee as Neve, Adrian Ciscato as Ty\n| LineColor       = 05BED0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 38\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 17\n| Title           = Would You Wrather Lose Your Bestie?\n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = 222\n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.

Jenna Wrather, the mother of the four Wrather siblings, has decided to start dating following the death of her husband two years earlier. At school, Cooper's crush, Peyton, turns down his offer to go to an upcoming school dance together because of overdue homework she must finish on the night of the dance. Later, Cooper is upset when he learns Cami helped Jenna sign up for a dating website, as he believes Jenna is simply bored and needs a hobby. Coop and Cami are dismayed to learn Jenna plans to go on a date with their school principal, Mr. Walker, so they consult the Wratherheads for advice.

He is a pet dinosaur of the series' main characters, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]] and [[Wilma Flintstone]].<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 15 things you don't know|work= Daily Telegraph |date=2010-09-30|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034627/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-15-things-you-dont-know.html|accessdate=2010-10-01|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> Dino debuted in the opening credits of the pilot episode of ''The Flintstones'', but is not mentioned by name until the first season's fourth episode, \"No Help Wanted.\"\n\n==Background==\nIn the series, Dino serves the role of a pet dog, and exhibits the characteristics of a typical domesticated canine.\n\nDino is a [[prosauropod]]-like [[dinosaur]], a Snorkasaurus. Dino is a relatively small dinosaur, only slightly larger than the humans of his time, smaller than [[mammoth]]s that appear in the series, and much smaller than the numerous sauropods that appear as work animals in the series (a full-sized sauropod appears as a crane in the opening sequence, and oversized \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] ribs\" the size of an automobile are seen in the closing credits).\n\nA recurring gag in the series is Fred coming home from work, and Dino gets excited and knocks him down and licks his face. But no matter how hard he tries to the contrary, Fred usually gives in to Dino's ticklish and wet doglike kisses. Dino frequently exhibits human emotions, nearly \"talking,\" and can also be moved to anger, at which point he snarls and snaps, especially when Fred tries to lie either to or in front of him, which he can always tell. He also loves to play with [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]] and [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]], the Flintstones' and Rubbles' respective offspring; these characters are introduced in the middle part of the series. In the episode \"Hop Happy\" Dino meets Hoppy, the Rubbles' new pet hopperoo. At first, Dino and Fred get scared, thinking he's a giant mouse, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy helps Dino rescue their owners in an accident.\n\nAlthough he is usually immune, Dino does take a couple of brief stabs at romance.  The first comes in the episode, \"Dino Goes Hollyrock\", which originally aired on September 14, 1962.  In it, Dino falls in love with female TV star sauropod \"Sassie\" (an obvious takeoff on \"[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]\") and then becomes her co-star on her TV show.  However, after she removes her false eyelashes and wig, he is shocked that she turned out to be an ugly, talented sauropod that could be beautified.  The second comes in the episode, \"Dino and Juliet\", which originally aired on November 26, 1964.  In it, Dino falls in love with the new neighbor's female sauropod (Juliet).  Their romance, which results in the birth of 15 puppies, helps end the feud between Fred and the new neighbor, Mr. Loudrock.\n\nAlthough Dino had already appeared earlier in the series' first season (such as the episode \"No Help Wanted\" and \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\" - these episodes were made after the \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" but aired before), Dino is portrayed quite differently in the first season's 18th episode \"The Snorkasaurus Hunter.\" In this episode, Fred and his friend [[Barney Rubble]] are on a camping trip, trying to hunt a snorkasaurus. Unlike Dino's other appearances, the snorkasaurus in this episode speaks and behaves toward Fred and Barney in a manner similar to comedian [[Phil Silvers]]. At the end of the episode, the Flintstones take in the dinosaur; the snorkasaurus (called \"Dino\" at one point by Wilma) is seen acting like a butler for the Flintstones: answering the telephone, dusting, and ironing. Dino in this episode also has purple skin instead of his varying pink-to-red color, which seems to vary from episode-to-episode during this early period, but is permanently purple after this episode. After this episode, Dino is permanently portrayed as behaving in a doglike fashion.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580278/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513034318/http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |archivedate=2012-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nDino's origins are explained in the episode \"Dino Disappears\", which originally aired on October 10, 1963.  In it, Wilma states that Dino followed Fred home because Fred was playing with him.  Fred counters by saying he was merely trying to chase him away. This seems to refer to the episode \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" where Fred and Barney's playing was actually hunting him down and Dino's following him was actually Dino sneaking onto the car.\n\nPost-original series, Dino appears in most of the series' spinoffs, except during the first season of ''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''. There, Dino is replaced by Wooly, a dwarf mammoth, as the Flintstone family's pet. However, starting with the following series' ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'', Dino once again becomes a regular character.\n\nIn the 1980-1982 series ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'', Dino is featured in his own segment, \"[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)#Dino and Cavemouse|Dino and Cavemouse]],\" where Dino tries futilely to capture a pesky [[mouse]] in the Flintstone household. The segments bear some similarities to classic cat-and-mouse cartoons such as ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. Dino later appears as a puppy in 1986-1988 series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' (including his own segment, \"Dino's Dilemmas\"), as Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's babysitter in the short-lived 1996 series ''[[Cave Kids]]'', and also starred in his own two 7-minute short cartoons, ''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dino: The Great Egg-Scape]]'' (1997).\n\n==Other media==\n[[File:Dino Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumbnail|right|Dino statue (right), along with [[Fred Flintstone]] (left).]]\nDino appears in both live-action movies. He isn't seen very often in the first film, 1994's ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]''. Dino was created with both computer-generated imagery and as a puppet from [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], while archival audio from the original series was used to serve as Dino's voice.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nHowever, in the second film, 2000's ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'', Dino has more screen time; he appears here as a puppy. Fred won Dino's egg as a prize after winning a carnival game. Initially, Fred didn't think much of the egg as he felt that the creatures inside never live long. On a [[Ferris wheel]], just as Fred and Wilma are about to kiss, Dino's egg hatches and he takes an immediate attachment to Fred, believing him to be his mother. (This, of course, contradicts Dino's origin in the original series.)\n\n==Filmography==\n===Television shows===\n* ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960\u20131966)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'' (1972\u20131974)\n* ''[[Fred Flintstone and Friends]]'' (1977\u20131978)\n* ''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' (1979\u20131980)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'' (1980\u20131982)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]'' (1982\u20131984)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' (1986\u20131988)\n* ''[[Cave Kids]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]'' (2020)\n\n===Films and Specials===\n* ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Energy: A National Issue]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[A Flintstone Christmas]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Little Big League]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Fred's Final Fling]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Wind-Up Wilma]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Jogging Fever]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Kids' \"Just Say No\" Special]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[Hanna-Barbera's 50th: A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration|A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration: 50 Years of Hanna-Barbera]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[I Yabba-Dabba Do!]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Hollyrock-a-Bye Baby]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[A Flintstone Family Christmas]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[A Flintstones Christmas Carol]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' \u2013 featuring ''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dino: The Great Egg-Scape]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: On the Rocks]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[The Flintstones & WWE: Stone Age SmackDown!]]'' (2015)\n\n==Portrayal==\nDino's barks and sound effects were provided by [[Mel Blanc]] for 27 years, from 1960\u20131987; archive audio of Blanc was used for Dino in the [[The Flintstones (film)|1994 live-action film]] and [[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas|its prequel in 2000]].

Reverend [[Bechara Boutros Rahi]] (a former member of the Order and current Maronite Patriarch) founded, in cooperation with Beirut University College (BUC) now the Lebanese American University (LAU), the Louaize College for Higher Education (LCHE), the nucleus of today's NDU. The legal finalization of this project was the promulgation by the President of The Lebanese Republic of the decree number 4116 on August 14, 1987, granting the right to operate an independent university.<ref>[http://www.ndu.edu.lb/About/History.htm History of Notre Dame University]</ref>\n\n==Academics==\nThe university adopts the American system of education.

Since its foundation in 1695 A.D. , the Order promoted education and improved the lives of people it serves in Lebanon. In 1978, the Order started a new project. Reverend [[Bechara Boutros Rahi]] (a former member of the Order and current Maronite Patriarch) founded, in cooperation with Beirut University College (BUC) now the Lebanese American University (LAU), the Louaize College for Higher Education (LCHE), the nucleus of today's NDU. The legal finalization of this project was the promulgation by the President of The Lebanese Republic of the decree number 4116 on August 14, 1987, granting the right to operate an independent university.<ref>[http://www.ndu.edu.lb/About/History.htm History of Notre Dame University]</ref>\n\n==Academics==\nThe university adopts the American system of education.

{"title_page": "United States Indian Police", "text_new": "[[Image:US Indian Police badge.png|thumb|U.S. Indian Police badge ca. 1890]]\n{{Law enforcement in the United States}}\nThe '''United States Indian Police''' (USIP) were organized in 1880 by [[John Q. Tufts]] the Indian Commissioner in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]], [[Indian Territory]], to police the [[Five Civilized Tribes]]. Their mission is to \"provide justice services and technical assistance to federally recognized Indian tribes.\"<ref name=\"bia.gov\">https://bia.gov/WhoWeAre/BIA/OJS/ojs-services/index.htm</ref> The USIP, after its founding in 1880, recruited many of their police officers from the ranks of the existing [[Lighthorse (American Indian police)|Indian Lighthorsemen]]. Unlike the Lighthorse who were under the direction of the individual tribe, the USIP was under the direction of the [[Indian agent]] assigned to the Union Agency. Many of the US Indian police officers were given [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy U.S. Marshal]] commissions that allowed them to cross jurisdictional boundaries and also to arrest non-Indians.\n\n==United States Indian Police Academy==\nThe '''United States Indian Police Academy''' was originally established as the United States Indian Police Training and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico on December 17, 1968. The program was administered by the Thiokol Chemical Corporation during the academy's period in Roswell and specialized to include the training of juvenile detention, criminal investigation and supervisors. In 1973, the academy was relocated to Brigham City, Utah to be combined with the Division of Law and Order Research and Statistical Unit from Pierre, South Dakota. The result was the creation of the Center for U.S. Indian Police Training and Research. The academy relocated to Marana, Arizona in 1984. In 1993, it was relocated again to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center grounds in Artesia, New Mexico, where it remains to this day.\n\nToday, the United States Indian Police Academy caters their training to the needs of the Indian Country Justice Services. The academy is designed to teach future USIP officers how to fulfill the unit's mission to \"prevent crimes, reduce recidivism, and support tribal justice systems.\" <ref name=\"bia.gov\"/> The positions generally filled by graduates include police officers, correctional officers, criminal investigators, tribal court staff and telecommunication equipment operators. Steven Juneau is the current Academy Director and Osceola Red Shirt is the Deputy Academy Director.<ref>https://www.indianaffairs.gov/cs/groups/xojs/documents/text/idc2-061311.pdf</ref>\n\n==Jurisdiction==\n{{main|Tribal sovereignty in the United States}}\nThe USIP was given authority over cases of manslaughter, murder, assault, rape, arson, and burglary in Native American communities with the passage of the Major Crimes Act of 1885, now codified as 18 U.S.C. 1153. However, the role of the USIP was often unclear and there was a continual need for new acts to increase its jurisdiction because of a lack of prior planning. The power of the United States Indian Police to arrest whites, half-Indians and those outside the reservation of their jurisdiction were continually challenged. This power was questioned in the case of U.S. v. Clapox, but the decision was left unclear. Maintenance of prohibition in Indian territory was passed in what is now 18 USC 1152, 1156, and 1161. These being passed further gave the USIP jurisdiction over non-Indians as the majority of bootleggers were Caucasian, though most of those arrested by the officers were their Native American customers who did not have the same access to quality attorneys. The 1913 Appropriation Act gave United States Indian Police the same powers as U.S. Marshals. The Johnson v. Gerald's case, 234 U.S. 422, further solidified the confiscation powers of the USIP in a decision about whether it was the place of the USIP to take or destroy Indian-made beverages or products.<ref name=\"tribal-institute.org\">http://www.tribal-institute.org/download/Indian%20Law%20Enforcement%20History.pdf</ref>\n\n==Pre-USIP law enforcement==\nWhile some tribes later policed by the United States Indian Police did not give individuals law enforcement responsibilities and made order a community effort, others had institutions similar to police. The [[Muscogee]] Creek had an organization whose purpose was to enforce the laws created by the tribe. The group was composed of warriors who had reached a certain level of renown. The [[Cherokee]] had both their own form of police, the Lighthorse, and court system. In fact, the attempt to replace the pre-existing law enforcement of the Native American tribes was marked by opposition from many tribes. The Commissioner received a letter from an agent of another Indian police force about the difficulties he'd met with Sioux opposition.  \"[T]here have existed among the Sioux and other tribes, native soldier organizations systematically governed by laws and regulations. Some of the opposition }}}}}}encountered in endeavoring to organize the police force in the spring of 1879 was from these native soldier organizations.\"<ref name=\"tribal-institute.org\"/>\n\n==Interaction with outlaws==\nOne of the major set-backs for the United States Indian Police was the activity of prominent Western outlaw gangs, including the Cooks, the Starrs and the Daltons. One of the members of the [[Dalton gang]], Bob Dalton, used his position as Chief of the Osage Police to the benefit of his and his gang's bootlegging careers. The Dalton Gang was also well known for murder and bank and train robberies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-dalton-gang-is-wiped-out-in-coffeyville-kansas|title=The Dalton Gang is wiped out in Coffeyville, Kansas - Oct 05, 1892 - HISTORY.com|publisher=}}</ref> using Indian Territory to evade Oklahoma officers. These groups would often fire upon USIP officers so as not to be captured and their bootlegging drew Native Americans under USIP jurisdiction into criminal activity as they consumed illegal goods the groups smuggled in. The outlaw problem became so dire that, in 1895, the Indian policy for officers included instructions for how to handle outlaws: \"Arrest all outlaws, thieves, and murderers in your section, and if they resist you will shoot them on the spot.\" <ref name=\"tribal-institute.org\"/>\n\n==Sam Sixkiller==\n'''Sam Sixkiller''' was a former High Sheriff of the Cherokee Nation who was recruited to become the Captain of the US Indian Police in 1880. In 1886 two Indians killed [[Sam Sixkiller]], the Captain of the US Indian Police and a Deputy US Marshal commissioned by the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas|Judicial District of Western Arkansas]]. He was known for surviving multiple gun battles over six years of service, he was unarmed when he shot on a Christmas Eve. After the killers escaped indictment by the Creek and Cherokee, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed a law (24 Stat., 463.) giving the [[United States district court]]s jurisdiction over any Indian who committed a crime against a federally appointed Indian police officer or United States Deputy Marshal. His death also resulted in a law making it a Federal offense to kill an Indian police officer, which is still in effect. (18 U.S.C. 1114.)\n\n==Other Indian police==\n\nThere were basically two other types of police officers on the reservations:\n* [[Indian tribal police]]\n*: Several Indian tribes replaced hereditary chiefs with constitutional governments. These tribes hired police officers under a number of different titles\u2014sheriffs, constables, regulators, lighthorsemen, etc.\u2014to enforce tribal laws.\n* [[Indian agency police]]\n*: Many tribes had no recognizable governments and therefore no tribal laws. On these reservations, the Indian agent assigned to the tribe hired Indian police from among tribal members to effect law and order according to Federal, agency, and treaty rules. These were considered federally appointed police officers. The Indian police that killed [[Sitting Bull]] were of this kind.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of federal law enforcement agencies]]\n* [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol1/HTML_files/SES0036.html Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties.

These tribes hired police officers under a number of different titles\u2014sheriffs, constables, regulators, lighthorsemen, etc.\u2014to enforce tribal laws.\n* [[Indian agency police]]\n*: Many tribes had no recognizable governments and therefore no tribal laws. On these reservations, the Indian agent assigned to the tribe hired Indian police from among tribal members to effect law and order according to Federal, agency, and treaty rules. These were considered federally appointed police officers. The Indian police that killed [[Sitting Bull]] were of this kind.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of federal law enforcement agencies]]\n* [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol1/HTML_files/SES0036.html Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties.

The portion of I-290 from [[Interstate 294|I-294]] to its east end is officially called the '''Dwight D. Eisenhower Expressway'''. In short form, it is known as \"the Ike\" or '''the Eisenhower'''. Before being designated the Eisenhower Expressway, the highway was called the '''Congress Expressway''' because of the surface street that was located approximately in its path and onto which I-290 runs at its eastern terminus in the [[Chicago Loop]].\n\nI-290 connects [[Interstate 90 in Illinois|I-90]] (Jane Addams Memorial Tollway) in [[Rolling Meadows, Illinois|Rolling Meadows]] with I-90/[[Interstate 94 in Illinois|I-94]] (John F. Kennedy Expressway / Dan Ryan Expressway) near the Loop. North of [[Interstate 355|I-355]], the freeway is sometimes known locally as [[Illinois Route 53]] (IL&nbsp;53), or simply Route&nbsp;53, since IL&nbsp;53 existed before I-290. However, it now merges with I-290 at Biesterfield Road. In total, I-290 is {{convert|29.84|mi}} long.\n\n== Route description ==\n\n=== Jane Addams Memorial Tollway to Veterans Memorial Tollway ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = \n| header_align = \n| header_background = \n| footer    = \n| footer_align = \n| footer_background = \n| width     = \n| image1    = I-290 at Northern Terminus with I-90 and IL SR-53.JPG\n| width1    = 180\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = I-290 at its northern terminus, the interchange with IL&nbsp;53 and I-90, in Schaumburg\n| image2    = Interstate290-schaumburg.jpg\n| width2    = 180\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = I- 290 at mile marker 4, looking north toward Schaumburg\n| image3    = \n| width3    = \n| alt3      = \n| caption3  = \n}}\nThis section is {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} long and runs from Rolling Meadows to [[Addison, Illinois|Addison]]. It is the portion of I-290 more locally known as \"Route&nbsp;53.\" Here, I-290 runs largely above-grade through [[Schaumburg, Illinois|Schaumburg]] and [[Elk Grove Village, Illinois|Elk Grove Village]], and at or below grade through [[Itasca, Illinois|Itasca]] and [[Addison, Illinois|Addison]].\n\nThe northern {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} of this highway were reconstructed in 2003\u201304. A left shoulder and an auxiliary lane between ramps were added, as well as improved lighting. The highway is four lanes wide (not counting the auxiliary lane) north of the Elgin\u2013O'Hare Expressway / Thorndale Avenue (mile marker 5), and five lanes wide with a wide left shoulder south to the exit to I-355.\n\nBetween mile markers 0 and 4, IL&nbsp;53 overlaps this section of the Eisenhower Expressway.\n\n=== Eisenhower Extension ===\n{{see also|U.S. Route 20 in Illinois}}\nThis section is {{convert|11|mi}} long and runs from Addison to [[Hillside, Illinois|Hillside]]. It took its name when the Eisenhower was extended northwest from Hillside. The highway runs largely at-grade or above-grade for this length. [[U.S. Route 20 in Illinois|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] (US&nbsp;20) overlaps I-290 around [[Elmhurst, Illinois|Elmhurst]] from mile markers 12 to 13, and runs parallel to the rest of this section between mile markers 7 and 18.\n\nThis section of I-290 varies in width from two lanes at the ramp east from the I-290/I-355 split, to three lanes between I-355 and US&nbsp;20, to three lanes plus two exit lanes at US&nbsp;20/[[Illinois Route 64|IL&nbsp;64]] (Lake Street / North Avenue) (exit 13B). After exit 13B, the highway reverts to three through traffic lanes. Exit 15 to southbound I-294 is a frequent point of congestion due to ramp traffic backing up onto the mainline highway, often as long as {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}}. This is because the ramp is not isolated from the mainline, only one lane in width, is a low-speed ramp (marked as a {{convert|35|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} ramp), and is relatively short ({{convert|1/4|mi|km|disp=or|abbr=on}}) while carrying a high volume of truck traffic south to Indiana from North Avenue. Additionally, the sudden appearance of the exit tends to cause accidents when cars in the center lane try to aggressively turn into the right lane, particularly at the mouth of the I-294 exit. Finally, there is a dangerous high-volume weaving situation at the end of the ramp to I-294 with southbound I-294 traffic exiting to westbound [[Interstate 88 (west)|I-88]]. As of 2006, there are no plans to overcome any of these problems with new construction.\n\nThe western {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} of this section are blacktop, while east of [[Illinois Route 83|IL&nbsp;83]] (exit 10) the original concrete is still in place.\n\n=== Tri-State Tollway to Austin Boulevard ===\n[[File:Oak Park Il I2901.jpg|thumb|left|I-290 in Oak Park]]\nThis section of I-290 is {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} long, and it runs from Hillside to the western border of Chicago. This section is sometimes referred to as \"The Avenues\". As of 2002, it is the third-most-congested stretch of highway in the Chicago area, behind the [[Circle Interchange]] area and the intersection of the [[Dan Ryan Expressway]] and the [[Chicago Skyway]].<ref name=fhwa_congestion>{{cite book |author1= Cambridge Systematics, Inc. |author2= Texas Transportation Institute |last-author-amp= yes |chapter= 2.0 Background to the Congestion Problem |chapter-url= http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestion_report_04/chapter2.htm |title= Traffic Congestion and Reliability: Linking Solutions to Problems |date= July 19, 2004 |publisher= Federal Highway Administration}}</ref> It is known for having a high volume of traffic on ramps through the Avenues, and high volumes of traffic on left-side ramps in Forest Park and Oak Park. I-290 runs above grade west of Mannheim Road, and at or below grade east of Mannheim Road.\n\nEastbound at Mannheim Road (exit 17), the highway splits into two express and one local lane; they are joined by two onramps from I-88 and form express lanes three lanes wide and local lanes to Mannheim Road two lanes wide. After Mannheim Road, the highway immediately narrows to three lanes in width, causing mile-long (1.6&nbsp;km) backups. It remains three lanes to Austin Boulevard. Westbound, I-290 merely is three lanes wide to Mannheim Road, and then four lanes wide to the I-88/I-290 split. Exits at Harlem Avenue (exit 21B) and Austin Boulevard (exit 23) are [[Inverted single-point urban interchange]]s (inverted SPUIs), with left offramps and onramps. These cause backups as trucks switch lanes to exit, and a large volume of traffic enters on the left side of the highway.\n\nIn 2001\u201302, this section between mile markers 15 and 18 was reconstructed in the first phase of an attempt to untangle the \"Hillside Strangler\", adding the local lanes and extra on-ramp to I-290. The second phase, reconstruction of the highway between mile markers 18 and 23 (Mannheim Road to Austin Boulevard), is still in the preliminary engineering phase of construction as of April 2009.\n\n=== Austin Boulevard to Chicago Loop ===\n[[File:Eisenhower Expressway.jpg|right|thumb|I-290 at mile marker 28, looking east toward downtown Chicago]]\nThe easternmost section of I-290 is {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} long and runs entirely through the city of Chicago to the terminus at I-90/I-94. It runs below grade for its entire length.\n\nThis highway is four lanes wide in both directions for its entire length, and most on-ramps and off-ramps are located just two blocks apart. Therefore, an exit in one direction may be marked one street (ex. Laramie Avenue), while the same exit in the other direction may be marked another (ex. Cicero Avenue), even though the streets are only a block apart. This configuration results in most exits on this portion of the road being marked as A/B exits.\n\nEastbound congestion is lighter here than through the \"Avenues\", generally limited to congestion on the tight onramps to the Kennedy and Dan Ryan Expressways (the Circle Interchange) at the eastern terminus or blind onramps at Kostner Avenue and at Homan Avenue. Westbound, congestion is heavy starting at Laramie due to the left-hand exit at Austin (which combines a \"perfect storm\" of a four-down-to-three lane reduction, an unfamiliar left-hand exit, and entrance and in-merging traffic of the central onramp).  Most afternoons, this bottleneck can skyrocket the \"Post Office to Wolf (Road)\" commute time to over an hour (up from 16 mins with no traffic).\n\nThe Eisenhower Expressway runs along blacktop pavement for the length of the section, except between Kostner Avenue and Independence Boulevard, where it runs on concrete pavement.\n\nThe eastern terminus of I-290 is the Circle Interchange with I-90/I-94. After this junction, the route becomes elevated and continues as a highway until [[LaSalle Street]], at which point it passes under [[LaSalle Street Station]] and comes out the other side as a city street ([[Congress Parkway|Ida B. Wells Drive]]). The Congress Parkway (Ida B. Wells Drive) route continues east until the street is stopped by [[Buckingham Fountain]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-290_il.html |title= Interstate 290 |work= Interstate Guide |publisher= AA Roads |accessdate= October 5, 2014}}{{Self-published source|date= March 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Eisenhower Halsted 4.21.2007.jpg|thumb|left|I-290 at Halsted Street]]\nThe  [[Blue Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Blue Line]] operates in the median of the Eisenhower from Halsted Street to [[Cicero (CTA Blue Line)|Cicero Avenue]]. After Cicero, the line leaves the median and runs on the south side of the Eisenhower for the remainder of its route to [[Forest Park (CTA)|Des Plaines Avenue, Forest Park]].\n\n== History ==\nAn expressway along the alignment of the Eisenhower Expressway was foreshadowed by [[Daniel Burnham]]'s [[Burnham Plan of Chicago|plan]] of 1909, which described a west side [[boulevard]]. The passageway under the old Post Office was designed to preserve the right-of-way for the future road.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cookexpressways.com/chapter11.html |year= 2006 |work= Building the Cook County Expressway System |accessdate=October 2, 2006 |last= Plummer |first= Andy |title=Building the Congress Expressway}}{{Self-published source|date= March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe expressway is named for the former President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]; it originally was called the Congress Expressway because it begins on Congress Parkway (now called Ida B. Wells Drive) in Chicago. The political columnist [[Mike Royko]] joked that it is Chicago's only Republican expressway, since the others all named after Democrats (though since that observation Bishop [[Louis Henry Ford]], a non-political figure, had a freeway named in his honor). The first segment, {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} in length opened from Mannheim Road to [[Illinois Route 171|1st Avenue]] in December 1955.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cookexpressways.com/chapter2.html |year=2006 |work= Building the Cook County Expressway System |accessdate=October 2, 2006 |last= Plummer |first= Andy |title=The Race To Catch Up In Building An Expressway System}}{{Self-published source|date= March 2015}}</ref> On December 15, an additional {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} was opened, from Ashland Avenue (1600 West) to Laramie Avenue (5200 West).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cookexpressways.com/chapter7.html |year=2006 |work= Building the Cook County Expressway System |accessdate=October 2, 2006 |last= Plummer |first= Andy |title=The First New Chicago Expressway}}{{Self-published source|date= March 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the Eisenhower Expressway was extended to [[U.S. Route 20 in Illinois|Lake Street]] and [[Illinois Route 64|North Avenue]]. In 1963, the first working example of [[ramp meter]]ing took place on the Eisenhower Expressway, based on successful metering through [[New York City]] tunnels and data from ramp closures in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. The first implementation utilized a police officer at the top of an entrance ramp, stopping and releasing vehicles onto the highway at a predetermined rate.<ref name=\"usdot\">{{cite book |url= https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/2703 |format= PDF |title= Ramp Metering Status in North America: 1995 Update |year= 1995 |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |id= DOT-T-95-17 |accessdate=August 16, 2008 |last1= Piotrowicz |first1= Gary |last2= Robinson |first2= James |last-author-amp= yes |page=3}}</ref> Another section opened in 1972, to a north\u2013south expressway in [[Addison, Illinois]]. At the time, this expressway was a short spur from the Eisenhower Expressway, and it was referred to as [[Illinois Route 53]], which continued north to Schaumburg. Construction on Illinois 53 had finished in 1970.<ref name=n9jig-290>{{cite web |url= http://www.n9jig.com/203-up.html |work= Illinois Highways Page |title= Routes 203 and up |last= Carlson |first= Rich |date= April 15, 2005 |accessdate= February 1, 2007 }}{{Self-published source|date= March 2015}}</ref>\n\nUntil 1978, the Eisenhower Expressway was marked as a part of I-90. In 1978, the I-90 designation was moved onto the John F. Kennedy Expressway and the [[Northwest Tollway]], replacing [[Illinois Route 194|IL&nbsp;194]]. The Eisenhower Expressway was then renumbered as I-290.\n\nBecause the segment from I-294 to IL&nbsp;53 was built last, that portion of the highway is referred to as the Eisenhower Extension. The Eisenhower Expressway, extension included, is {{convert|23|mi}} long. If the IL&nbsp;53 portion of I-290 is added to that, the highway is {{convert|30|mi}} long.\n\nIn 2003\u201304, the first {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} of I-290 out of [[Schaumburg, Illinois|Schaumburg]] were rebuilt, replacing pavement that had well-exceeded its estimated 20-year lifetime. (The original pavement was built in stages from 1963 through 1970 as part of IL&nbsp;53.)<ref name=n9jig>{{cite web |last= Carlson |first= Rich |url= http://www.n9jig.com/41-60.html |work= Illinois State Highways Page |title= Routes 41 thru 60 |date= March 15, 2006 |accessdate= March 26, 2006}}{{Self-published source|date= March 2015}}</ref> A fifth auxiliary lane was added between the entrance and exit ramps of exits 1, 4, and 5. The most important safety upgrade was the demolition of the raised grassy median between the westbound and eastbound lanes, and its replacement with a permanent concrete median and wide shoulders.\n\n[[File:Eisenhower Mannheim 4.21.2007.jpg|thumb|Inbound I-290 at the Hillside Strangler]]\n[[File:I88i294i290interchange.svg|thumb|Diagram of the Hillside Strangler]]\n{{anchor|Hillside Strangler}}\n* '''Hillside Strangler''': Named after the Chicago suburb of [[Hillside, Illinois|Hillside]], it refers to a major merge with [[Interstate 88 (west)|I-88]], and almost always is used when referring to inbound (eastbound) traffic. It is at this point that I-88 terminates eastbound. It was called the Strangler because, before its reconstruction in the early 2000s, seven through lanes were forced to merge to three, creating large backups. Reconstruction widened part of this area to nine lanes (five inbound; three through; two local; and four through lanes outbound). This allowed direct exits to Mannheim Road ([[U.S. Route 12 in Illinois|US&nbsp;12]]/[[U.S. Route 20 in Illinois|US&nbsp;20]]/[[U.S. Route 45 in Illinois|US&nbsp;45]]) from I-88, the ramp also serving for an I-88 truck access to eastbound I-290; created an inbound collector\u2013distributor ramp for Mannheim Road; and added a timed gate that closed a ramp from [[Roosevelt Road]] ([[Illinois Route 38|IL&nbsp;38]]) to inbound I-290 during the afternoon rush hours. These improvements helped congestion at the site, but they also pushed pre-existing congestion further east to the six-lane portion of the highway. The Hillside Strangler is located at about mile marker 18.\n* '''The Avenues''': The portion of the highway between Mannheim Road at mile marker 17 and First Avenue in [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]], a stretch of {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}}. Named because all of the crossroads between these two exits are named numerically, in ascending order traveling outbound (westbound). 1st Avenue ([[Illinois Route 171|IL&nbsp;171]]) is exit 20. There are exits to 9th Avenue, 17th Avenue, and 25th Avenue to the west. These exits are spaced about three-quarters of a mile (1200&nbsp;m) apart. This stretch is notorious for being very congested.<ref name=fhwa_congestion/>\n* The '''Eisenhower Extension''' or '''290 Extension''': The {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} of road between current-day mile marker 7 ([[Interstate 355|I-355]] south to US&nbsp;20/Lake Street) and North Avenue ([[Illinois Route 64|IL&nbsp;64]]), mile marker 15. This section was built in the late 1970s.\n* The '''[[Circle Interchange]]''': The eastern terminus of I-290 where it meets I-90/I-94, which overlap through Chicago. North of this interchange I-90/I- 94 is called the Kennedy Expressway, while south of it I-90/I-94 is called the Dan Ryan Expressway. The interchange itself consists of eight heavily used, very tight ramps that wind around each other, giving the interchange a distinct circle shape when looked at from above. This design, adequate when first built in the 1950s, forces drivers to slow down to speeds of about {{convert|20|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} due to its tightly wound curves.  Not only does this lead to the worst congestion in the Chicago area,<ref name=fhwa_congestion/> a 2010 study of freight congestion (truck speed and travel time) by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] ranked this section of the I-290 as having the worst congestion in the United States; the average truck speed just {{convert|29|mi/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |author= Office of Freight Management and Operations |title= Table 3-9: Top 25 Freight Highway Locations by Freight Congestion Index Rating, 2010  |work= Freight Facts and Figures 2011 |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |year= 2011 |url= http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/freight_analysis/nat_freight_stats/docs/11factsfigures/table3_9.htm}}</ref>  The interchange, rechristened the Jane Byrne interchange is currently being reworked with an estimated completion date of 2022\n\n=== Post Office ===\n[[File:Chicago Central Post Office (old)2.jpg|thumb|Drivers coming out from under the Post Office]]\nJust east of the I-290\u2013I-90/94 Junction in downtown Chicago, the [[Old Chicago Main Post Office]] is a building that stretches over Ida B. Wells Drive. If one drives eastbound on I-290 and continues past I-90/I-94, the highway ends and becomes Ida B. Wells Drive. The Post Office was a landmark that was sometimes used in referring to the end of I-290 in downtown Chicago. For example, a traffic reporter might say \"...forty minutes from Mannheim to the Post Office\".\n\nThis large building was used by the [[United States Postal Service]] until 1996. The building itself was built from 1921 to 1933 in the [[Art-Deco]] style, and it is {{convert|2.5|e6sqft|m\u00b2}} in size. The building built several decades before the expressway that passes through it, was originally designed to accommodate a roadway\u2014requiring only minimal work to remove walls in the base for the freeway to pass through.

The portion of I-290 from [[Interstate 294|I-294]] to its east end is officially called the '''Dwight D. Eisenhower Expressway'''. In short form, it is known as \"the Ike\" or '''the Eisenhower'''. Before being designated the Eisenhower Expressway, the highway was called the '''Congress Expressway''' because of the surface street that was located approximately in its path and onto which I-290 runs at its eastern terminus in the [[Chicago Loop]].\n\nI-290 connects [[Interstate 90 in Illinois|I-90]] (Jane Addams Memorial Tollway) in [[Rolling Meadows, Illinois|Rolling Meadows]] with I-90/[[Interstate 94 in Illinois|I-94]] (John F. Kennedy Expressway / Dan Ryan Expressway) near the Loop. North of [[Interstate 355|I-355]], the freeway is sometimes known locally as [[Illinois Route 53]] (IL&nbsp;53), or simply Route&nbsp;53, since IL&nbsp;53 existed before I-290. However, it now merges with I-290 at Biesterfield Road. In total, I-290 is {{convert|29.84|mi}} long.\n\n== Route description ==\n\n=== Jane Addams Memorial Tollway to Veterans Memorial Tollway ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = \n| header_align = \n| header_background = \n| footer    = \n| footer_align = \n| footer_background = \n| width     = \n| image1    = I-290 at Northern Terminus with I-90 and IL SR-53.JPG\n| width1    = 180\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = I-290 at its northern terminus, the interchange with IL&nbsp;53 and I-90, in Schaumburg\n| image2    = Interstate290-schaumburg.jpg\n| width2    = 180\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = I- 290 at mile marker 4, looking north toward Schaumburg\n| image3    = \n| width3    = \n| alt3      = \n| caption3  = \n}}\nThis section is {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} long and runs from Rolling Meadows to [[Addison, Illinois|Addison]]. It is the portion of I-290 more locally known as \"Route&nbsp;53.\" Here, I-290 runs largely above-grade through [[Schaumburg, Illinois|Schaumburg]] and [[Elk Grove Village, Illinois|Elk Grove Village]], and at or below grade through [[Itasca, Illinois|Itasca]] and [[Addison, Illinois|Addison]].\n\nThe northern {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} of this highway were reconstructed in 2003\u201304. A left shoulder and an auxiliary lane between ramps were added, as well as improved lighting. The highway is four lanes wide (not counting the auxiliary lane) north of the Elgin\u2013O'Hare Expressway / Thorndale Avenue (mile marker 5), and five lanes wide with a wide left shoulder south to the exit to I-355.\n\nBetween mile markers 0 and 4, IL&nbsp;53 overlaps this section of the Eisenhower Expressway.\n\n=== Eisenhower Extension ===\n{{see also|U.S. Route 20 in Illinois}}\nThis section is {{convert|11|mi}} long and runs from Addison to [[Hillside, Illinois|Hillside]]. It took its name when the Eisenhower was extended northwest from Hillside. The highway runs largely at-grade or above-grade for this length. [[U.S. Route 20 in Illinois|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] (US&nbsp;20) overlaps I-290 around [[Elmhurst, Illinois|Elmhurst]] from mile markers 12 to 13, and runs parallel to the rest of this section between mile markers 7 and 18.\n\nThis section of I-290 varies in width from two lanes at the ramp east from the I-290/I-355 split, to three lanes between I-355 and US&nbsp;20, to three lanes plus two exit lanes at US&nbsp;20/[[Illinois Route 64|IL&nbsp;64]] (Lake Street / North Avenue) (exit 13B). After exit 13B, the highway reverts to three through traffic lanes. Exit 15 to southbound I-294 is a frequent point of congestion due to ramp traffic backing up onto the mainline highway, often as long as {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}}. This is because the ramp is not isolated from the mainline, only one lane in width, is a low-speed ramp (marked as a {{convert|35|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} ramp), and is relatively short ({{convert|1/4|mi|km|disp=or|abbr=on}}) while carrying a high volume of truck traffic south to Indiana from North Avenue. Additionally, the sudden appearance of the exit tends to cause accidents when cars in the center lane try to aggressively turn into the right lane, particularly at the mouth of the I-294 exit. Finally, there is a dangerous high-volume weaving situation at the end of the ramp to I-294 with southbound I-294 traffic exiting to westbound [[Interstate 88 (west)|I-88]]. As of 2006, there are no plans to overcome any of these problems with new construction.\n\nThe western {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} of this section are blacktop, while east of [[Illinois Route 83|IL&nbsp;83]] (exit 10) the original concrete is still in place.\n\n=== Tri-State Tollway to Austin Boulevard ===\n[[File:Oak Park Il I2901.jpg|thumb|left|I-290 in Oak Park]]\nThis section of I-290 is {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} long, and it runs from Hillside to the western border of Chicago. This section is sometimes referred to as \"The Avenues\". As of 2002, it is the third-most-congested stretch of highway in the Chicago area, behind the [[Circle Interchange]] area and the intersection of the [[Dan Ryan Expressway]] and the [[Chicago Skyway]].<ref name=fhwa_congestion>{{cite book |author1= Cambridge Systematics, Inc. |author2= Texas Transportation Institute |last-author-amp= yes |chapter= 2.0 Background to the Congestion Problem |chapter-url= http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestion_report_04/chapter2.htm |title= Traffic Congestion and Reliability: Linking Solutions to Problems |date= July 19, 2004 |publisher= Federal Highway Administration}}</ref> It is known for having a high volume of traffic on ramps through the Avenues, and high volumes of traffic on left-side ramps in Forest Park and Oak Park. I-290 runs above grade west of Mannheim Road, and at or below grade east of Mannheim Road.\n\nEastbound at Mannheim Road (exit 17), the highway splits into two express and one local lane; they are joined by two onramps from I-88 and form express lanes three lanes wide and local lanes to Mannheim Road two lanes wide. After Mannheim Road, the highway immediately narrows to three lanes in width, causing mile-long (1.6&nbsp;km) backups. It remains three lanes to Austin Boulevard. Westbound, I-290 merely is three lanes wide to Mannheim Road, and then four lanes wide to the I-88/I-290 split. Exits at Harlem Avenue (exit 21B) and Austin Boulevard (exit 23) are [[Inverted single-point urban interchange]]s (inverted SPUIs), with left offramps and onramps. These cause backups as trucks switch lanes to exit, and a large volume of traffic enters on the left side of the highway.\n\nIn 2001\u201302, this section between mile markers 15 and 18 was reconstructed in the first phase of an attempt to untangle the \"Hillside Strangler\", adding the local lanes and extra on-ramp to I-290. The second phase, reconstruction of the highway between mile markers 18 and 23 (Mannheim Road to Austin Boulevard), is still in the preliminary engineering phase of construction as of April 2009.\n\n=== Austin Boulevard to Chicago Loop ===\n[[File:Eisenhower Expressway.jpg|right|thumb|I-290 at mile marker 28, looking east toward downtown Chicago]]\nThe easternmost section of I-290 is {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} long and runs entirely through the city of Chicago to the terminus at I-90/I-94. It runs below grade for its entire length.\n\nThis highway is four lanes wide in both directions for its entire length, and most on-ramps and off-ramps are located just two blocks apart. Therefore, an exit in one direction may be marked one street (ex. Laramie Avenue), while the same exit in the other direction may be marked another (ex. Cicero Avenue), even though the streets are only a block apart. This configuration results in most exits on this portion of the road being marked as A/B exits.\n\nEastbound congestion is lighter here than through the \"Avenues\", generally limited to congestion on the tight onramps to the Kennedy and Dan Ryan Expressways (the Circle Interchange) at the eastern terminus or blind onramps at Kostner Avenue and at Homan Avenue. Westbound, congestion is heavy starting at Laramie due to the left-hand exit at Austin (which combines a \"perfect storm\" of a four-down-to-three lane reduction, an unfamiliar left-hand exit, and entrance and in-merging traffic of the central onramp).  Most afternoons, this bottleneck can skyrocket the \"Post Office to Wolf (Road)\" commute time to over an hour (up from 16 mins with no traffic).\n\nThe Eisenhower Expressway runs along blacktop pavement for the length of the section, except between Kostner Avenue and Independence Boulevard, where it runs on concrete pavement.\n\nThe eastern terminus of I-290 is the Circle Interchange with I-90/I-94. After this junction, the route becomes elevated and continues as a highway until [[LaSalle Street]], at which point it passes under [[LaSalle Street Station]] and comes out the other side as a city street ([[Congress Parkway|Ida B. Wells Drive]]). The Congress Parkway (Ida B. Wells Drive) route continues east until the street is stopped by [[Buckingham Fountain]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-290_il.html |title= Interstate 290 |work= Interstate Guide |publisher= AA Roads |accessdate= October 5, 2014}}{{Self-published source|date= March 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Eisenhower Halsted 4.21.2007.jpg|thumb|left|I-290 at Halsted Street]]\nThe  [[Blue Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Blue Line]] operates in the median of the Eisenhower from Halsted Street to [[Cicero (CTA Blue Line)|Cicero Avenue]]. After Cicero, the line leaves the median and runs on the south side of the Eisenhower for the remainder of its route to [[Forest Park (CTA)|Des Plaines Avenue, Forest Park]].\n\n== History ==\nAn expressway along the alignment of the Eisenhower Expressway was foreshadowed by [[Daniel Burnham]]'s [[Burnham Plan of Chicago|plan]] of 1909, which described a west side [[boulevard]]. The passageway under the old Post Office was designed to preserve the right-of-way for the future road.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cookexpressways.com/chapter11.html |year= 2006 |work= Building the Cook County Expressway System |accessdate=October 2, 2006 |last= Plummer |first= Andy |title=Building the Congress Expressway}}{{Self-published source|date= March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe expressway is named for the former President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]; it originally was called the Congress Expressway because it begins on Congress Parkway (now called Ida B. Wells Drive) in Chicago. The political columnist [[Mike Royko]] joked that it is Chicago's only Republican expressway, since the others all named after Democrats (though since that observation Bishop [[Louis Henry Ford]], a non-political figure, had a freeway named in his honor). The first segment, {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} in length opened from Mannheim Road to [[Illinois Route 171|1st Avenue]] in December 1955.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cookexpressways.com/chapter2.html |year=2006 |work= Building the Cook County Expressway System |accessdate=October 2, 2006 |last= Plummer |first= Andy |title=The Race To Catch Up In Building An Expressway System}}{{Self-published source|date= March 2015}}</ref> On December 15, an additional {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} was opened, from Ashland Avenue (1600 West) to Laramie Avenue (5200 West).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cookexpressways.com/chapter7.html |year=2006 |work= Building the Cook County Expressway System |accessdate=October 2, 2006 |last= Plummer |first= Andy |title=The First New Chicago Expressway}}{{Self-published source|date= March 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the Eisenhower Expressway was extended to [[U.S. Route 20 in Illinois|Lake Street]] and [[Illinois Route 64|North Avenue]]. In 1963, the first working example of [[ramp meter]]ing took place on the Eisenhower Expressway, based on successful metering through [[New York City]] tunnels and data from ramp closures in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. The first implementation utilized a police officer at the top of an entrance ramp, stopping and releasing vehicles onto the highway at a predetermined rate.<ref name=\"usdot\">{{cite book |url= https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/2703 |format= PDF |title= Ramp Metering Status in North America: 1995 Update |year= 1995 |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |id= DOT-T-95-17 |accessdate=August 16, 2008 |last1= Piotrowicz |first1= Gary |last2= Robinson |first2= James |last-author-amp= yes |page=3}}</ref> Another section opened in 1972, to a north\u2013south expressway in [[Addison, Illinois]].

In 1978, the I-90 designation was moved onto the John F. Kennedy Expressway and the [[Northwest Tollway]], replacing [[Illinois Route 194|IL&nbsp;194]]. The Eisenhower Expressway was then renumbered as I-290.\n\nBecause the segment from I-294 to IL&nbsp;53 was built last, that portion of the highway is referred to as the Eisenhower Extension. The Eisenhower Expressway, extension included, is {{convert|23|mi}} long. If the IL&nbsp;53 portion of I-290 is added to that, the highway is {{convert|30|mi}} long.\n\nIn 2003\u201304, the first {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} of I-290 out of [[Schaumburg, Illinois|Schaumburg]] were rebuilt, replacing pavement that had well-exceeded its estimated 20-year lifetime.

The most important safety upgrade was the demolition of the raised grassy median between the westbound and eastbound lanes, and its replacement with a permanent concrete median and wide shoulders.\n\n[[File:Eisenhower Mannheim 4.21.2007.jpg|thumb|Inbound I-290 at the Hillside Strangler]]\n[[File:I88i294i290interchange.svg|thumb|Diagram of the Hillside Strangler]]\n{{anchor|Hillside Strangler}}\n* '''Hillside Strangler''': Named after the Chicago suburb of [[Hillside, Illinois|Hillside]], it refers to a major merge with [[Interstate 88 (west)|I-88]], and almost always is used when referring to inbound (eastbound) traffic. It is at this point that I-88 terminates eastbound. It was called the Strangler because, before its reconstruction in the early 2000s, seven through lanes were forced to merge to three, creating large backups. Reconstruction widened part of this area to nine lanes (five inbound; three through; two local; and four through lanes outbound). This allowed direct exits to Mannheim Road ([[U.S. Route 12 in Illinois|US&nbsp;12]]/[[U.S. Route 20 in Illinois|US&nbsp;20]]/[[U.S. Route 45 in Illinois|US&nbsp;45]]) from I-88, the ramp also serving for an I-88 truck access to eastbound I-290; created an inbound collector\u2013distributor ramp for Mannheim Road; and added a timed gate that closed a ramp from [[Roosevelt Road]] ([[Illinois Route 38|IL&nbsp;38]]) to inbound I-290 during the afternoon rush hours. These improvements helped congestion at the site, but they also pushed pre-existing congestion further east to the six-lane portion of the highway. The Hillside Strangler is located at about mile marker 18.\n* '''The Avenues''': The portion of the highway between Mannheim Road at mile marker 17 and First Avenue in [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]], a stretch of {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}}. Named because all of the crossroads between these two exits are named numerically, in ascending order traveling outbound (westbound). 1st Avenue ([[Illinois Route 171|IL&nbsp;171]]) is exit 20. There are exits to 9th Avenue, 17th Avenue, and 25th Avenue to the west. These exits are spaced about three-quarters of a mile (1200&nbsp;m) apart. This stretch is notorious for being very congested.<ref name=fhwa_congestion/>\n* The '''Eisenhower Extension''' or '''290 Extension''': The {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} of road between current-day mile marker 7 ([[Interstate 355|I-355]] south to US&nbsp;20/Lake Street) and North Avenue ([[Illinois Route 64|IL&nbsp;64]]), mile marker 15. This section was built in the late 1970s.\n* The '''[[Circle Interchange]]''': The eastern terminus of I-290 where it meets I-90/I-94, which overlap through Chicago. North of this interchange I-90/I- 94 is called the Kennedy Expressway, while south of it I-90/I-94 is called the Dan Ryan Expressway. The interchange itself consists of eight heavily used, very tight ramps that wind around each other, giving the interchange a distinct circle shape when looked at from above. This design, adequate when first built in the 1950s, forces drivers to slow down to speeds of about {{convert|20|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} due to its tightly wound curves.  Not only does this lead to the worst congestion in the Chicago area,<ref name=fhwa_congestion/> a 2010 study of freight congestion (truck speed and travel time) by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] ranked this section of the I-290 as having the worst congestion in the United States; the average truck speed just {{convert|29|mi/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |author= Office of Freight Management and Operations |title= Table 3-9: Top 25 Freight Highway Locations by Freight Congestion Index Rating, 2010  |work= Freight Facts and Figures 2011 |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |year= 2011 |url= http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/freight_analysis/nat_freight_stats/docs/11factsfigures/table3_9.htm}}</ref>  The interchange, rechristened the Jane Byrne interchange is currently being reworked with an estimated completion date of 2022\n\n=== Post Office ===\n[[File:Chicago Central Post Office (old)2.jpg|thumb|Drivers coming out from under the Post Office]]\nJust east of the I-290\u2013I-90/94 Junction in downtown Chicago, the [[Old Chicago Main Post Office]] is a building that stretches over Ida B. Wells Drive. If one drives eastbound on I-290 and continues past I-90/I-94, the highway ends and becomes Ida B. Wells Drive. The Post Office was a landmark that was sometimes used in referring to the end of I-290 in downtown Chicago. For example, a traffic reporter might say \"...forty minutes from Mannheim to the Post Office\".\n\nThis large building was used by the [[United States Postal Service]] until 1996. The building itself was built from 1921 to 1933 in the [[Art-Deco]] style, and it is {{convert|2.5|e6sqft|m\u00b2}} in size. The building built several decades before the expressway that passes through it, was originally designed to accommodate a roadway\u2014requiring only minimal work to remove walls in the base for the freeway to pass through. In spite of its unused state, the building is still known to visitors and commuters alike as the unofficial gateway into the Chicago Loop area.<ref>{{cite news |last= Gallun |first= Alby |title=$300M revival plan for Post Office |work=[[Crain's Chicago Business]] |date=July 1, 2005 |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=16994&rel=1 |accessdate=January 12, 2006}}</ref> In late August 2009, the United States Postal Service announced an auction was to be held to sell the facility to the highest bidder.
