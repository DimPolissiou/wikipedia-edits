{"title_page": "Trauma Quality Improvement Program", "text_new": "The '''Trauma Quality Improvement Program''' ('''TQIP''') was initiated in 2008 by the [[American College of Surgeons]] Committee on Trauma. Its aim is to provide risk-adjusted data for the purpose of reducing variability in adult [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] outcomes and offering best practice guidelines to improve trauma care. TQIP makes use of national data to allows hospitals to objectively evaluate their trauma centers' performance relative to other hospitals. TQIP's administrative costs are less than those of other programs, making it an accessible tool for assessing performance and enhancing quality of trauma care.\n\n==Background==\nMorbidity and mortality rates are variable across United States [[trauma center]]s.

Twenty-three Level I and II trauma centers volunteered and were selected to participate in the study with ACS verification. Most Level I centers are university-based trauma centers with comprehensive services. Level II centers were included to increase geographic and patient diversity, as well as the statistical power of any analyses. Each participating center received a registrar training course that included information about TQIP objectives and infrastructures, critical data collection fields, and NTDS data definitions. Webinars with conference calls and test case data abstraction were used for follow-up training.<ref name=\"Hemmila\" />\n \nUsing NTDB data from patients admitted to trauma centers between January 1 and December 1, 2007, three cohorts were created. The first cohort included patients with blunt multisystem or blunt mechanism traumas with an [[Abbreviated Injury Scale]] (AIS) score \u2265 3 in two or more regions including the head, face, neck, thorax, abdomen, spine, and extremities. The second cohort was composed of trauma patients with penetrating truncal injuries with an AIS score \u2265 3 in at least one region including the neck, thorax, and abdomen. Patients in the third cohort had a blunt single-system injury with an AIS score \u2265 3 in only one AIS body region, with the remaining regions having a maximum AIS score of 2. The outcomes of interest were death during hospitalization as evidenced by an [[emergency department]] (ED) discharge disposition of \u201cdeath\u201d or hospital discharge disposition of \u201cexpired,\u201d as well as the prevalence of inpatient complications.<ref name=\"Hemmila\" />\n\n===Results===\nData reports were created and distributed to each participating trauma center in June 2009. Results were consistent with the previous year's baseline findings. Cohorts of similar verified trauma centers had differences in risk-adjusted mortality rates with a large amount of variance between low-outlier and high-outlier trauma centers. The aggregate group had a relative risk-mortality of 3.3, while the single-system trauma cohort had a mortality 5.9 times higher for high-outlier facilities.<ref name=\"Hemmila\" />\n \nThe TQIP pilot results gave each trauma center feedback regarding their trauma outcomes relative to other hospitals. The results also shed light on appropriate actions to undertake in order to improve quality, such as by illuminating local or regional collaborative efforts that could implemented. Overall, the pilot study demonstrated that TQIP's anonymous measures of relative performance could successfully allow trauma centers to identify shortcomings and facilitate quality improvement using existing resources and systems at local, regional, and national levels.<ref name=\"Hemmila\" />\n\n==Methodology==\nTQIP utilizes a [[retrospective cohort study|retrospective cohort]] of trauma patients in designated and ACS-verified Level I and II hospitals in the United States and Canada. There is no minimum sample size requirement for a trauma center to participate in the program. {{As of |2014}}, over 200 participating Level I and II trauma centers that vary in type (public, private teaching university, teaching community, etc.) and region participate in TQIP.<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n\n===Inclusion criteria===\nTo participate in the program, patients must meet the following inclusion criteria: be an adult greater than sixteen years of age with at least one valid [[ICD-9-CM Volume 3|ICD 9 CM]] diagnosis code, history of blunt or penetrating mechanisms of injury, or have an AIS score \u2265 3. Eligible patients also must have emergency department or hospital dispositions available.<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n\n===Exclusion criteria===\nPatients are excluded from the program if they have a pre-existing [[advance health care directive|advance directive]] to withhold life-sustaining measures or are older than 65 years of age and have an isolated hip fracture.<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n\n===Patient categorization===\nThe program categorizes patients into different cohorts in order to evaluate different aspects of trauma care.<ref name=\"Newgard\" /> The cohorts are as follows:\n# Blunt multisystem injury with an AIS &gt; 3 in a least two regions of the body\n# Penetrating truncal injury with an AIS &gt; 3 in the regions of the neck, chest, or abdomen\n# Shock patients with a systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg\n# Patients with isolated [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI)\n# Elderly patients (over 65 years of age) without isolated hip fractures\n\n===Outcomes===\nThis program focuses on mortality, complications, and resource use. Mortality is further subdivided into on arrival, in the emergency department, and in-hospital. Complications are further subdivided into [[urinary tract infection]]s, deep [[venous thrombosis]], [[ventilator-associated pneumonia]], [[central venous catheter|central line]]-related [[bacteremia]], [[renal failure]], and [[surgical site infection]]s.  Resource use is measured via [[length of stay]] in the hospital, length of stay in the [[intensive care unit]], and number of days that a patient is on a [[medical ventilator|ventilator]].<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n\n===Data quality===\nTQIP addresses quality issues by explicitly addressing certain care metrics, including monitoring [[intracranial pressure]] in patients with [[traumatic brain injury|traumatic brain injuries]], measuring time to operations, measuring the placement and timing of [[tracheostomy|tracheostomies]], measuring the time to [[hemorrhage]] control, and documenting the use of [[venous thromboembolism]] [[prophylaxis]].<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n \nTQIP helps ensure the quality of data by providing training for trauma registrars and data abstractors. TQIP administrators hold monthly activities, such as webinars and quizzes, to educate registrars on the importance of data quality. Administrators assess outlier values, perform internal and external validation, and perform data logic checks.<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n\n===Statistical analyses===\nTQIP measures multiple variables in its risk-adjustment models. These variables include factors such as age, race, gender, initial pulse rate in the emergency department, the mechanism of injury, etc. An 18 variable multivariable logistic regression model is used to estimate risk-adjusted mortality for trauma patients. Results provide observed-to-expected ratios and a 90% [[confidence interval]] of a trauma center's data compared to other de-identified trauma centers in order to gauge relative variability.<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n\n==Applications==\nTQIP is designed to give each hospital an objective measure of its trauma center's performance compared to that of other trauma centers. It is meant as a self-reflective tool to be used in determining how to improve outcomes and decrease costs by understanding the reasons for variability and identifying best practices. Results are not intended to be used for marketing purposes or bestowing competitive advantages.<ref name=\"Shafi\" /> TQIP reports allow hospitals to focus on outcomes and workflows, including care coordination, in-hospital processes, and resource allocation.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Lissauer M.

Deliverables comprise risk adjusted hospital comparisons in the form of one annual benchmark report as well as two separate annual reports related to a topic of interest and the TQIP online analysis tool. Education and training are delivered via the annual meeting, online training, monthly educational experiences for abstractors, and monthly open forum calls for registry staff. Data are submitted quarterly and quality is monitored through a data validation site visit, a TQIP validator, and data quality reporting. Feedback to participating trauma centers about their relative performance encourages the sharing of practices during the annual meeting with emphasis on high performers and web conferences.<ref name=\"Hemmila\" />\n \nThe TQIP annual fee is $9,000 and includes the deliverables above. Additional costs include the salary of the registrar and trauma registry software. As the compilation and maintenance of the trauma registry are required for verification, the additional cost to a currently verified trauma center is for participation.<ref name=\"Hemmila\" />\n\n==Debate==\n\n===Data===\nTQIP's outcome estimates are heavily dependent on data quality and sample size for each participating trauma center. Despite the development of sophisticated statistical models which attempt to mitigate errors in precision, the small sample sizes of highly specific trauma patient populations will inevitably skew results. Similarly, centers reporting data need to be hyper-aware of their reporting for data fields for certain patient populations susceptible to biased or missing data (e.g., high prevalence of low [[Injury Severity Score]]s for patients with early death who did not receive complete diagnostic testing or autopsies).<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n\n===Racial/ethnic minority trauma outcomes===\n{{As of| 2013}}, TQIP has not incorporated measures related to racial disparities in trauma outcomes. However, there is evidence to suggest that differences in trauma outcomes are due to the overall quality of hospitals serving higher proportions of minority patients, rather than being due to discriminatory delivery of care; that is, these hospitals are less likely to provide recommended care to patients.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Dick A.W., Glance L.G., Li Y., Meredith J.W., Mukamel D.B., Osler T.M. | year = 2013 | title = Trends in racial disparities for injured patients admitted to trauma centers | journal = Journal of Health Services Research | volume = 48 | issue = 5| pages = 1684\u2013703 | doi = 10.1111/1475-6773 | pmid = 23662602 | pmc = 3796108 }}</ref> In fact, almost 80% of trauma centers serving primarily minority patients are classified as high mortality trauma centers due to their ratios of observed-to-expected survival rates. Patients from all racial and ethnic backgrounds appear to be 40% more likely to survive when treated at low mortality trauma centers when compared with patients of the same race and ethnicity with the same injuries being treated at high mortality trauma centers.<ref name=\"Cooper\">Cooper et al. (2013). Minority trauma patients tend to cluster at trauma centers with worse-than-expected mortality: Can this phenomenon help explain racial disparities in trauma outcomes?

This is done out of concern regarding varying patient transit times among trauma centers located in more urban vs. rural environments as well as the severity of injuries more likely to be present at certain trauma centers. However, this practice has the potential to remove a sizable number of patients from a trauma center's mortality index (for example, if a trauma center that is exceptionally skillful at the resuscitation phase of care may receive no credit), thus impeding analysis of a vital component of trauma care. Similarly, there can be great variation in how trauma centers classify DOA patients, leading to differences in treatment (e.g., resuscitation attempts or other invasive procedures). While independent researchers have found that inclusion of ED deaths in statistical analyses yields only small, insignificant changes in TQIP outcomes, doing so eliminates bias that might otherwise be introduced.<ref>Calland, J. F., Nathens, A. B., Young, J. S., Neal, M. L., Goble, S., Abelson, J., . . . Hemmila, M. R. (2012).

Patients in the third cohort had a blunt single-system injury with an AIS score \u2265 3 in only one AIS body region, with the remaining regions having a maximum AIS score of 2. The outcomes of interest were death during hospitalization as evidenced by an [[emergency department]] (ED) discharge disposition of \u201cdeath\u201d or hospital discharge disposition of \u201cexpired,\u201d as well as the prevalence of inpatient complications.<ref name=\"Hemmila\" />\n\n===Results===\nData reports were created and distributed to each participating trauma center in June 2009. Results were consistent with the previous year's baseline findings. Cohorts of similar verified trauma centers had differences in risk-adjusted mortality rates with a large amount of variance between low-outlier and high-outlier trauma centers. The aggregate group had a relative risk-mortality of 3.3, while the single-system trauma cohort had a mortality 5.9 times higher for high-outlier facilities.<ref name=\"Hemmila\" />\n \nThe TQIP pilot results gave each trauma center feedback regarding their trauma outcomes relative to other hospitals. The results also shed light on appropriate actions to undertake in order to improve quality, such as by illuminating local or regional collaborative efforts that could implemented. Overall, the pilot study demonstrated that TQIP's anonymous measures of relative performance could successfully allow trauma centers to identify shortcomings and facilitate quality improvement using existing resources and systems at local, regional, and national levels.<ref name=\"Hemmila\" />\n\n==Methodology==\nTQIP utilizes a [[retrospective cohort study|retrospective cohort]] of trauma patients in designated and ACS-verified Level I and II hospitals in the United States and Canada. There is no minimum sample size requirement for a trauma center to participate in the program. {{As of |2014}}, over 200 participating Level I and II trauma centers that vary in type (public, private teaching university, teaching community, etc.) and region participate in TQIP.<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n\n===Inclusion criteria===\nTo participate in the program, patients must meet the following inclusion criteria: be an adult greater than sixteen years of age with at least one valid [[ICD-9-CM Volume 3|ICD 9 CM]] diagnosis code, history of blunt or penetrating mechanisms of injury, or have an AIS score \u2265 3. Eligible patients also must have emergency department or hospital dispositions available.<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n\n===Exclusion criteria===\nPatients are excluded from the program if they have a pre-existing [[advance health care directive|advance directive]] to withhold life-sustaining measures or are older than 65 years of age and have an isolated hip fracture.<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n\n===Patient categorization===\nThe program categorizes patients into different cohorts in order to evaluate different aspects of trauma care.<ref name=\"Newgard\" /> The cohorts are as follows:\n# Blunt multisystem injury with an AIS &gt; 3 in a least two regions of the body\n# Penetrating truncal injury with an AIS &gt; 3 in the regions of the neck, chest, or abdomen\n# Shock patients with a systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg\n# Patients with isolated [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI)\n# Elderly patients (over 65 years of age) without isolated hip fractures\n\n===Outcomes===\nThis program focuses on mortality, complications, and resource use. Mortality is further subdivided into on arrival, in the emergency department, and in-hospital. Complications are further subdivided into [[urinary tract infection]]s, deep [[venous thrombosis]], [[ventilator-associated pneumonia]], [[central venous catheter|central line]]-related [[bacteremia]], [[renal failure]], and [[surgical site infection]]s.  Resource use is measured via [[length of stay]] in the hospital, length of stay in the [[intensive care unit]], and number of days that a patient is on a [[medical ventilator|ventilator]].<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n\n===Data quality===\nTQIP addresses quality issues by explicitly addressing certain care metrics, including monitoring [[intracranial pressure]] in patients with [[traumatic brain injury|traumatic brain injuries]], measuring time to operations, measuring the placement and timing of [[tracheostomy|tracheostomies]], measuring the time to [[hemorrhage]] control, and documenting the use of [[venous thromboembolism]] [[prophylaxis]].<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n \nTQIP helps ensure the quality of data by providing training for trauma registrars and data abstractors. TQIP administrators hold monthly activities, such as webinars and quizzes, to educate registrars on the importance of data quality. Administrators assess outlier values, perform internal and external validation, and perform data logic checks.<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n\n===Statistical analyses===\nTQIP measures multiple variables in its risk-adjustment models. These variables include factors such as age, race, gender, initial pulse rate in the emergency department, the mechanism of injury, etc. An 18 variable multivariable logistic regression model is used to estimate risk-adjusted mortality for trauma patients. Results provide observed-to-expected ratios and a 90% [[confidence interval]] of a trauma center's data compared to other de-identified trauma centers in order to gauge relative variability.<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n\n==Applications==\nTQIP is designed to give each hospital an objective measure of its trauma center's performance compared to that of other trauma centers. It is meant as a self-reflective tool to be used in determining how to improve outcomes and decrease costs by understanding the reasons for variability and identifying best practices. Results are not intended to be used for marketing purposes or bestowing competitive advantages.<ref name=\"Shafi\" /> TQIP reports allow hospitals to focus on outcomes and workflows, including care coordination, in-hospital processes, and resource allocation.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Lissauer M.

Deliverables comprise risk adjusted hospital comparisons in the form of one annual benchmark report as well as two separate annual reports related to a topic of interest and the TQIP online analysis tool. Education and training are delivered via the annual meeting, online training, monthly educational experiences for abstractors, and monthly open forum calls for registry staff. Data are submitted quarterly and quality is monitored through a data validation site visit, a TQIP validator, and data quality reporting. Feedback to participating trauma centers about their relative performance encourages the sharing of practices during the annual meeting with emphasis on high performers and web conferences.<ref name=\"Hemmila\" />\n \nThe TQIP annual fee is $9,000 and includes the deliverables above. Additional costs include the salary of the registrar and trauma registry software. As the compilation and maintenance of the trauma registry are required for verification, the additional cost to a currently verified trauma center is for participation.<ref name=\"Hemmila\" />\n\n==Debate==\n\n===Data===\nTQIP's outcome estimates are heavily dependent on data quality and sample size for each participating trauma center. Despite the development of sophisticated statistical models which attempt to mitigate errors in precision, the small sample sizes of highly specific trauma patient populations will inevitably skew results. Similarly, centers reporting data need to be hyper-aware of their reporting for data fields for certain patient populations susceptible to biased or missing data (e.g., high prevalence of low [[Injury Severity Score]]s for patients with early death who did not receive complete diagnostic testing or autopsies).<ref name=\"Newgard\" />\n\n===Racial/ethnic minority trauma outcomes===\n{{As of| 2013}}, TQIP has not incorporated measures related to racial disparities in trauma outcomes. However, there is evidence to suggest that differences in trauma outcomes are due to the overall quality of hospitals serving higher proportions of minority patients, rather than being due to discriminatory delivery of care; that is, these hospitals are less likely to provide recommended care to patients.<ref>Dick, A.W., Glance, L.G., Li, Y., Meredith, J.W., Mukamel, D.B., Osler, T.M. (2013). Trends in racial disparities for injured patients admitted to trauma centers. Journal of Health Services Research, 48(5), 1684-703. doi: 10.1111/1475-6773. {{PMID|23662602}}</ref> In fact, almost 80% of trauma centers serving primarily minority patients are classified as high mortality trauma centers due to their ratios of observed-to-expected survival rates. Patients from all racial and ethnic backgrounds appear to be 40% more likely to survive when treated at low mortality trauma centers when compared with patients of the same race and ethnicity with the same injuries being treated at high mortality trauma centers.<ref name=\"Cooper\">Cooper et al. (2013). Minority trauma patients tend to cluster at trauma centers with worse-than-expected mortality: Can this phenomenon help explain racial disparities in trauma outcomes? Annals of Surgery, 258(4), 572-581. doi: 10.1097/SLA.0b013e3182a50148. {{PMID|23979271}}</ref> Differences between groups are relatively small compared to overall discrepancies between recommended and observed care.<ref>Rayan, N., Barnes, S., Fleming, N., Kudyakov, R., Ballard, D., Gentilello, L. M., & Shafi, S. (2012). Barriers to compliance with evidence-based care in trauma. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, 72(3), 585-593.</ref> Still, high mortality status is not universal among institutions treating predominantly minority patients, and TQIP has not addressed this inequity.<ref name=\"Cooper\" />\n\n===Exclusions===\nTQIP excludes from statistical analyses all [[dead on arrival]] (DOA) patients and those who expire in the emergency department. This is done out of concern regarding varying patient transit times among trauma centers located in more urban vs. rural environments as well as the severity of injuries more likely to be present at certain trauma centers. However, this practice has the potential to remove a sizable number of patients from a trauma center's mortality index (for example, if a trauma center that is exceptionally skillful at the resuscitation phase of care may receive no credit), thus impeding analysis of a vital component of trauma care. Similarly, there can be great variation in how trauma centers classify DOA patients, leading to differences in treatment (e.g., resuscitation attempts or other invasive procedures). While independent researchers have found that inclusion of ED deaths in statistical analyses yields only small, insignificant changes in TQIP outcomes, doing so eliminates bias that might otherwise be introduced.<ref>Calland, J. F., Nathens, A. B., Young, J. S., Neal, M. L., Goble, S., Abelson, J., . . . Hemmila, M. R. (2012).

Enrollment is done on a rolling basis that allows hospitals to join at any time. Additionally, a pediatric TQIP pilot with thirty-eight participating centers is currently underway and external data validation has been implemented.<ref>http://www.facs.org/trauma/ntdb/tqip.html</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.facs.org/trauma/ntdb/tqip.html TQIP website ]\n* [http://www.facs.org/ American College of Surgeons]\n* [http://www.mtqip.org/ Michigan TQIP]\n\n[[Category:Traumatology]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:, added 1 PMID, added 1 PMC, templated 2 journal cites (Diberri fmt authors)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_Quality_Improvement_Program"}

The site has been the London terminus of services provided by the [[Great Western Railway]] and its successors since 1838. Much of the main line station dates from 1854 and was designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]].\n\nPaddington is the London terminus of the [[Great Western main line]], operated today by [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]], which provides the majority of commuter and regional passenger services to west London and the [[Thames Valley]] region as well as long-distance intercity services to [[South West England]] and [[South Wales]]. It is also the terminus for the [[Heathrow Express]] and [[TfL Rail]] services to and from [[Heathrow Airport]]. It is one of 11 London stations managed directly by [[Network Rail]]. It is situated in [[London fare zone 1|fare zone 1]] and has two separate tube stations providing connections to the [[Bakerloo line|Bakerloo]], [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]], [[District line|District]], and [[Hammersmith & City line]]s.\n\nThe station has been perennially popular for passengers and goods, particularly milk and parcels. Major upgrades took place in the 1870s, the 1910s and the 1960s, each trying to add additional platforms and space while trying to preserve the existing services and architecture as much as possible. Paddington was first served by London Underground trains in 1863, as the original western terminus of the [[Metropolitan Railway]], the world's first underground railway. In the 20th century, suburban and commuter services appeared at Paddington as the [[urban sprawl]] of London moved westwards. Despite the numerous upgrades and rebuilding, plus damage sustained in particular during [[World War II]], Brunel's original design is still recognisable.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Paddington station location map.svg|thumb|left|240px|Station location map. The Paddington&nbsp;(underground) station marked here is the southern station on Praed Street.]]\nThe station complex is bounded at the front by [[Praed Street]] and at the rear by Bishop's Bridge Road, which crosses the station throat on [[Bishop's Bridge]]. On the west side of the station is Eastbourne Terrace, while the east side is bounded by the Paddington arm of the [[Grand Union Canal]]. The station is in a shallow cutting, a fact obscured at the front by a hotel building, but which can be clearly seen from the other three sides.<ref name=\"lbwpb\">{{cite web |title=Paddington Station Planning Brief |publisher= Westminster City Council |url=http://www3.westminster.gov.uk/docstores/publications_store/BriefMar08redraft2.pdf |date=April 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2008}}</ref> To the north of the station is the [[Westway, London|Westway]], to the northeast is [[Edgware Road]], and to the east and southeast is the [[London Inner Ring Road]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://londonmap360.com/london-bus-map#.WbPOGtOGN2Q|title=Central London Bus Map|publisher=London Map 360|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe surrounding area is partly residential, and includes the major [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]], restaurants and hotels. Until recently there was little office accommodation in the area, and most commuters interchanged between [[National Rail]] and the [[London Underground]] to reach workplaces in the [[West End of London|West End]] or the [[City of London|City]]. However, recent redevelopment of derelict railway and canal land, marketed as [[Paddington Waterside]], has resulted in new office complexes nearby.<ref name=lbwpb/>{{sfn|Brindle|2004|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nThe station is in [[London fare zone 1]]. In addition to the Underground stations at Paddington, [[Lancaster Gate tube station|Lancaster Gate station]] on the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] is a short walk away to the south. A little further to the south lie the conjoined parks of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and [[Kensington Gardens]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Lancaster Gate Tube Station | url = http://www.londontown.com/LondonInformation/Underground_Stations/Lancaster_Gate/33e0/ | work = LondonTown.com | accessdate = 21 April 2015}}</ref> Several [[London Buses]] routes, including Nos.&nbsp;[[London Buses route 23|23]] and [[London Buses route 205|205]] serve the station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/bus-route-maps/key-bus-routes-in-central-london.pdf|title=Key Bus Routes in Central London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:DISTRICT(1888) p140 - Paddington Station (plan).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Layout of Paddington Station in 1888]]\nThe National Rail station is officially named '''London Paddington''', a name commonly used outside London but rarely by Londoners, who call it just '''Paddington''', as on the [[tube map|London Underground map]]. This same practice applies to all the London mainline rail termini, except London Bridge. Parts of the station, including the main [[train shed]], date from 1854, when it was built by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] as the London terminus for the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR). It is one of eleven stations in London managed by [[Network Rail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.networkrail.co.uk/communities/passengers/our-stations// |title=Commercial information |date=April 2014 |work=Our Stations |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page= |accessdate=13 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\n===Great Western Railway===\nAfter several false starts, Brunel announced the construction of a railway from Bristol to London on 30 July 1833. This became the GWR, and he intended it to be the best railway in the country.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=3}} The GWR had originally planned to terminate London services at {{rws|Euston}} as this allowed them to use part of the [[London and Birmingham Railway]]'s track into the station, which would have been cost effective.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=14}} This received government approval in 1835, but was rejected as a long-term solution by Brunel as he was concerned it would also allow [[Liverpool]] to compete as a port with Bristol if the railway from Birmingham was extended.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=14}}{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=303}}\n\nThe first station was a temporary terminus for the GWR on the west side of Bishop's Bridge Road, opened on 4 June 1838. The first GWR service from London to Taplow, near Maidenhead, ran from Paddington in 1838. After the main station opened, this became the site of the goods depot.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=20}}{{sfn|Butt|1995|p=180}} Brunel did not consider that anything less than a grand terminus dedicated to the GWR would be acceptable, and consequently this was approved in February 1853.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=306}}\n\n[[File:Paddingtonstation.jpg|thumb|Paddington Station in the Victorian era]]\nThe main station between Bishop's Bridge Road and Praed Street was designed by Brunel, who was enthusiastic at the idea of being able to design a railway station himself, although much of the architectural detailing was by his associate [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]].  He took inspiration from [[Joseph Paxton]]'s [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] and the [[M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof]].{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=396}} The glazed roof is supported by [[wrought iron]] arches in three spans, respectively spanning {{convert|68|ft|m|sigfig=2}}, {{convert|102|ft|m|sigfig=2}} and {{convert|70|ft|m|sigfig=2}}. The roof is {{convert|699|ft|m|sigfig=2}} long, and the original roof spans had two [[transept]]s connecting the three spans. It is commonly believed that these were provided by Brunel to accommodate [[Transfer table|traversers]] to carry [[Coach (rail)|coaches]] between the tracks within the station. However recent research, using early documents and photographs, does not seem to support this belief, and their actual purpose is unknown.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=21}}{{sfn|Butt|1995|p=180}}{{sfn|Cole|2011|p=104}} The original station used four platforms, {{convert|27|ft|adj=on}}-wide and {{convert|24|ft|6|in|adj=on}}-wide departure platforms, a {{convert|21|ft|adj=on}} arrival platform, and a {{convert|47|ft|adj=on}} combined arrival platform and cab road. A series of nineteen turnplates were sited beyond the ends of the platforms for horse and coach traffic.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=308}}\n\nThe first GWR service from the new station departed on 16 January 1854, though the roof had not been finished at this point and there were no arrivals. It was formally opened on 29 May, and the older temporary station was demolished the following year.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=308}}\n\n[[File:Hilton London Paddington.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Praed Street facade of the Great Western Hotel (now the [[Hilton London Paddington]])]]\nThe [[Hilton London Paddington|Great Western Hotel]] was built on [[Praed Street]] in front of the station from 1851 to 1854 by architect [[Philip Charles Hardwick]], son of [[Philip Hardwick]] (designer of the [[Euston Arch]]) in a classical and French-chateau design. It opened on 9 June 1854, and had 103 bedrooms and 15 sitting rooms. Each corner contained a tower containing two additional floors beyond the five storeys of the main block.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=308}} It was originally run by a consortium of GWR shareholders and staff, before the company took over operations completely in 1896.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=311}} The station was substantially enlarged in 1906\u20131915 and a fourth span of {{convert|109|ft|m|sigfig=2}} was added on the north side, parallel to the others. The new span was built in a similar style to the original three spans, but the detailing is different and it has no transepts.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=60}}<ref name=nramg>{{cite web |title=Architectural mini guide \u2013 Paddington |publisher=[[Network Rail]] |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/documents/3053_PaddingtonArchitecturalMiniGuide.pdf\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910055155/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/documents/3053_PaddingtonArchitecturalMiniGuide.pdf\n|archivedate=10 September 2012|accessdate=19 February 2015}}</ref> The area between the rear of the hotel and the concourse is called the Lawn. It was originally unroofed and occupied by sidings, but was later built up to form part of the station's first concourse.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=98}}<ref name=nramg/>\n\nPaddington's capacity was doubled to four tracks in the 1870s. The quadrupling was completed to {{rws|Westbourne Park}} on 30 October 1871, {{rws|Slough}} in June 1879 and {{rws|Maidenhead}} in September 1884. An additional platform (later to become No.&nbsp;9) opened in June 1878, while two new departure platforms (later Nos.&nbsp;4&nbsp;and&nbsp;5) were added in 1885.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=313}} One of the lines between what is now platform 5 and 7 was removed, in order that the latter could be moved to a more southerly position. Aside from the June 1878 work, Brunel's original roof structure remained untouched throughout the improvements.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=314}}\n\nThe GWR began experimenting with the electric lighting in 1880, leading to Paddington being decorated with Christmas lights that year. Although the system was unreliable, it spurred the GWR on to a more ambitious lighting scheme in 1886, in which a 145V AC supply could light the terminus, office, goods yard and [[Royal Oak tube station|Royal Oak]] and [[Westbourne Park tube station|Westbourne Park]] stations. It was praised for its scale and showing that electricity could compete with [[gas lighting]] on the same scale.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=314}}\n\nPaddington became an important milk depot towards the end of the 19th century. A milk dock was built 1881, and by the 20th century over 3,000 churns were being handled at the station every day. Other goods such as meat, fish, horses and flowers were also transported through Paddington. Passenger traffic continued to improve as well. In March 1906, the goods depot at Westbourne Park was moved to [[Old Oak Common TMD|Old Oak Common]]. The main departure platform was extended in 1908 and used for milk and parcels.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|pp=315\u2013316}} In 1911, work began to separate light and empty carriage traffic from running trains between Paddington to Old Oak Common, which involved the rebuilding of Westbourne Park station. The work was halted because of [[World War I]] but resumed in 1926, to be completed the following year.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=317}} Three new platforms were added; platform 12 in November 1913, platform 11 in December 1915, and platform 10 the following year.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=318}} The roof was completely reconstructed between 1922 and 1924, replacing Brunel's original cast-iron columns with steel replicas.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=319}}\n\n[[File:Jagger GWR memorial1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Great Western Railway War Memorial|The GWR memorial]]]]\nUnlike several other London termini, Paddington saw no damage during [[World War I]]. Although [[London Victoria station|Victoria]] and {{rws|Charing Cross}} were the main stations for military movement during the war, Paddington was used for some of this traffic, and a 24-hour buffet was available at the station.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=318}}\n\nOn [[Armistice Day]] 1922, a [[Great Western Railway War Memorial|memorial]] to the employees of the GWR who died during the war was unveiled by [[Victor Spencer, 1st Viscount Churchill|Viscount Churchill]].

Platforms 2 to 11 were extended past the Bishop's Road bridge and a new parcel depot was built.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=319}} Suburban services, which had never been considered important at Paddington, were increased as new housing estates in the Home Counties started being built. Bishop's Road station was rebuilt, giving an extra four platforms to Paddington (Nos.&nbsp;13\u201316) and providing a new ticket office and entrance for suburban services next to the bridge.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=320}} A public address system was introduced in 1936.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=321}} By this time, around 22,000 parcels a day were being forwarded from Paddington, with the Royal Mail service processing around 4,500 mailbags and 2,400 parcel bags every day.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=91}}\n\nThe station came under attack several times during [[World War II]]. On 17 April 1941, the departure side of the station was hit by a parachute mine, while on 22 March 1944, the roof between platforms 6 and 7 was destroyed by two {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on}} flying bombs.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=69}} Passenger traffic greatly increased through Paddington during the war, partly by evacuation to the relatively quiet [[Thames Valley]], and because holidaymakers chose to travel west as large areas of the south and east coasts had been taken over for military purposes. On 29 July 1944, the station was closed for three hours because the platforms were saturated with passenger traffic, while on the subsequent [[Bank holiday|August bank holiday]], crowds were controlled in tight queues along Eastbourne Terrace by mounted police.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=322}}\n\n[[File:Paddington_-_GWR_43187_meets_Brunel.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Statue of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]]]\nSteam traffic began to be replaced in the late 1950s. Between 1959 and 1961, suburban services switched to [[diesel multiple unit]]s, while the last regular long-distance steam train left Paddington on 11 June 1965.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=324}} The track layout was reorganised in 1967, abolishing the distinction between arrival and departure platforms that had been a feature of Paddington since opening. A new set of sidings was built south of Royal Oak, and the track curve into Paddington was eased. Services to the Midlands were rerouted via {{rws|Marylebone}} during this time. The station concourse was enlarged in 1970, and the ticket office was rebuilt in the same year.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=325}} By this time, public opinion had turned against wholesale demolition and redevelopment of stations such as Euston, and consequently the rebuilding work was done with an eye towards preserving Brunel and Wyatt's original station design.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=326}}{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=94}} Special steam services began to be run from Paddington again in the 1980s.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=370}}\n\nIn 1982, a bronze statue of Brunel was erected on the station concourse. It was sculpted by John Doubleday and funded by the [[Bristol and West Building Society]].{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=369}} Between 1989 and 1999, the Lawn was re-roofed and separated from the concourse by a glass screen wall.

known as '''London Paddington''', is a [[London station group|Central London railway terminus]] and [[London Underground]] station complex, located on [[Praed Street]] in the [[Paddington]] area. The site has been the London terminus of services provided by the [[Great Western Railway]] and its successors since 1838. Much of the main line station dates from 1854 and was designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]].\n\nPaddington is the London terminus of the [[Great Western main line]], operated today by [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]], which provides the majority of commuter and regional passenger services to west London and the [[Thames Valley]] region as well as long-distance intercity services to [[South West England]] and [[South Wales]]. It is also the terminus for the [[Heathrow Express]] and [[TfL Rail]] services to and from [[Heathrow Airport]]. It is one of 11 London stations managed directly by [[Network Rail]]. It is situated in [[London fare zone 1|fare zone 1]] and has two separate tube stations providing connections to the [[Bakerloo line|Bakerloo]], [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]], [[District line|District]], and [[Hammersmith & City line]]s.\n\nThe station has been perennially popular for passengers and goods, particularly milk and parcels. Major upgrades took place in the 1870s, the 1910s and the 1960s, each trying to add additional platforms and space while trying to preserve the existing services and architecture as much as possible. Paddington was first served by London Underground trains in 1863, as the original western terminus of the [[Metropolitan Railway]], the world's first underground railway. In the 20th century, suburban and commuter services appeared at Paddington as the [[urban sprawl]] of London moved westwards. Despite the numerous upgrades and rebuilding, plus damage sustained in particular during [[World War II]], Brunel's original design is still recognisable.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Paddington station location map.svg|thumb|left|240px|Station location map. The Paddington&nbsp;(underground) station marked here is the southern station on Praed Street.]]\nThe station complex is bounded at the front by [[Praed Street]] and at the rear by Bishop's Bridge Road, which crosses the station throat on [[Bishop's Bridge]]. On the west side of the station is Eastbourne Terrace, while the east side is bounded by the Paddington arm of the [[Grand Union Canal]]. The station is in a shallow cutting, a fact obscured at the front by a hotel building, but which can be clearly seen from the other three sides.<ref name=\"lbwpb\">{{cite web |title=Paddington Station Planning Brief |publisher= Westminster City Council |url=http://www3.westminster.gov.uk/docstores/publications_store/BriefMar08redraft2.pdf |date=April 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2008}}</ref> To the north of the station is the [[Westway, London|Westway]], to the northeast is [[Edgware Road]], and to the east and southeast is the [[London Inner Ring Road]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://londonmap360.com/london-bus-map#.WbPOGtOGN2Q|title=Central London Bus Map|publisher=London Map 360|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe surrounding area is partly residential, and includes the major [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]], restaurants and hotels. Until recently there was little office accommodation in the area, and most commuters interchanged between [[National Rail]] and the [[London Underground]] to reach workplaces in the [[West End of London|West End]] or the [[City of London|City]]. However, recent redevelopment of derelict railway and canal land, marketed as [[Paddington Waterside]], has resulted in new office complexes nearby.<ref name=lbwpb/>{{sfn|Brindle|2004|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nThe station is in [[London fare zone 1]]. In addition to the Underground stations at Paddington, [[Lancaster Gate tube station|Lancaster Gate station]] on the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] is a short walk away to the south. A little further to the south lie the conjoined parks of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and [[Kensington Gardens]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Lancaster Gate Tube Station | url = http://www.londontown.com/LondonInformation/Underground_Stations/Lancaster_Gate/33e0/ | work = LondonTown.com | accessdate = 21 April 2015}}</ref> Several [[London Buses]] routes, including Nos.&nbsp;[[London Buses route 23|23]] and [[London Buses route 205|205]] serve the station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/bus-route-maps/key-bus-routes-in-central-london.pdf|title=Key Bus Routes in Central London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:DISTRICT(1888) p140 - Paddington Station (plan).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Layout of Paddington Station in 1888]]\nThe National Rail station is officially named '''London Paddington''', a name commonly used outside London but rarely by Londoners, who call it just '''Paddington''', as on the [[tube map|London Underground map]]. This same practice applies to all the London mainline rail termini, except London Bridge. Parts of the station, including the main [[train shed]], date from 1854, when it was built by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] as the London terminus for the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR). It is one of eleven stations in London managed by [[Network Rail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.networkrail.co.uk/communities/passengers/our-stations// |title=Commercial information |date=April 2014 |work=Our Stations |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page= |accessdate=13 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\n===Great Western Railway===\nAfter several false starts, Brunel announced the construction of a railway from Bristol to London on 30 July 1833. This became the GWR, and he intended it to be the best railway in the country.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=3}} The GWR had originally planned to terminate London services at {{rws|Euston}} as this allowed them to use part of the [[London and Birmingham Railway]]'s track into the station, which would have been cost effective.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=14}} This received government approval in 1835, but was rejected as a long-term solution by Brunel as he was concerned it would also allow [[Liverpool]] to compete as a port with Bristol if the railway from Birmingham was extended.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=14}}{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=303}}\n\nThe first station was a temporary terminus for the GWR on the west side of Bishop's Bridge Road, opened on 4 June 1838. The first GWR service from London to Taplow, near Maidenhead, ran from Paddington in 1838. After the main station opened, this became the site of the goods depot.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=20}}{{sfn|Butt|1995|p=180}} Brunel did not consider that anything less than a grand terminus dedicated to the GWR would be acceptable, and consequently this was approved in February 1853.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=306}}\n\n[[File:Paddingtonstation.jpg|thumb|Paddington Station in the Victorian era]]\nThe main station between Bishop's Bridge Road and Praed Street was designed by Brunel, who was enthusiastic at the idea of being able to design a railway station himself, although much of the architectural detailing was by his associate [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]].  He took inspiration from [[Joseph Paxton]]'s [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] and the [[M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof]].{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=396}} The glazed roof is supported by [[wrought iron]] arches in three spans, respectively spanning {{convert|68|ft|m|sigfig=2}}, {{convert|102|ft|m|sigfig=2}} and {{convert|70|ft|m|sigfig=2}}. The roof is {{convert|699|ft|m|sigfig=2}} long, and the original roof spans had two [[transept]]s connecting the three spans. It is commonly believed that these were provided by Brunel to accommodate [[Transfer table|traversers]] to carry [[Coach (rail)|coaches]] between the tracks within the station. However recent research, using early documents and photographs, does not seem to support this belief, and their actual purpose is unknown.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=21}}{{sfn|Butt|1995|p=180}}{{sfn|Cole|2011|p=104}} The original station used four platforms, {{convert|27|ft|adj=on}}-wide and {{convert|24|ft|6|in|adj=on}}-wide departure platforms, a {{convert|21|ft|adj=on}} arrival platform, and a {{convert|47|ft|adj=on}} combined arrival platform and cab road. A series of nineteen turnplates were sited beyond the ends of the platforms for horse and coach traffic.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=308}}\n\nThe first GWR service from the new station departed on 16 January 1854, though the roof had not been finished at this point and there were no arrivals. It was formally opened on 29 May, and the older temporary station was demolished the following year.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=308}}\n\n[[File:Hilton London Paddington.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Praed Street facade of the Great Western Hotel (now the [[Hilton London Paddington]])]]\nThe [[Hilton London Paddington|Great Western Hotel]] was built on [[Praed Street]] in front of the station from 1851 to 1854 by architect [[Philip Charles Hardwick]], son of [[Philip Hardwick]] (designer of the [[Euston Arch]]) in a classical and French-chateau design. It opened on 9 June 1854, and had 103 bedrooms and 15 sitting rooms. Each corner contained a tower containing two additional floors beyond the five storeys of the main block.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=308}} It was originally run by a consortium of GWR shareholders and staff, before the company took over operations completely in 1896.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=311}} The station was substantially enlarged in 1906\u20131915 and a fourth span of {{convert|109|ft|m|sigfig=2}} was added on the north side, parallel to the others.

The quadrupling was completed to {{rws|Westbourne Park}} on 30 October 1871, {{rws|Slough}} in June 1879 and {{rws|Maidenhead}} in September 1884. An additional platform (later to become No.&nbsp;9) opened in June 1878, while two new departure platforms (later Nos.&nbsp;4&nbsp;and&nbsp;5) were added in 1885.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=313}} One of the lines between what is now platform 5 and 7 was removed, in order that the latter could be moved to a more southerly position. Aside from the June 1878 work, Brunel's original roof structure remained untouched throughout the improvements.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=314}}\n\nThe GWR began experimenting with the electric lighting in 1880, leading to Paddington being decorated with Christmas lights that year. Although the system was unreliable, it spurred the GWR on to a more ambitious lighting scheme in 1886, in which a 145V AC supply could light the terminus, office, goods yard and [[Royal Oak tube station|Royal Oak]] and [[Westbourne Park tube station|Westbourne Park]] stations. It was praised for its scale and showing that electricity could compete with [[gas lighting]] on the same scale.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=314}}\n\nPaddington became an important milk depot towards the end of the 19th century. A milk dock was built 1881, and by the 20th century over 3,000 churns were being handled at the station every day. Other goods such as meat, fish, horses and flowers were also transported through Paddington. Passenger traffic continued to improve as well. In March 1906, the goods depot at Westbourne Park was moved to [[Old Oak Common TMD|Old Oak Common]]. The main departure platform was extended in 1908 and used for milk and parcels.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|pp=315\u2013316}} In 1911, work began to separate light and empty carriage traffic from running trains between Paddington to Old Oak Common, which involved the rebuilding of Westbourne Park station. The work was halted because of [[World War I]] but resumed in 1926, to be completed the following year.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=317}} Three new platforms were added; platform 12 in November 1913, platform 11 in December 1915, and platform 10 the following year.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=318}} The roof was completely reconstructed between 1922 and 1924, replacing Brunel's original cast-iron columns with steel replicas.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=319}}\n\n[[File:Jagger GWR memorial1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Great Western Railway War Memorial|The GWR memorial]]]]\nUnlike several other London termini, Paddington saw no damage during [[World War I]]. Although [[London Victoria station|Victoria]] and {{rws|Charing Cross}} were the main stations for military movement during the war, Paddington was used for some of this traffic, and a 24-hour buffet was available at the station.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=318}}\n\nOn [[Armistice Day]] 1922, a [[Great Western Railway War Memorial|memorial]] to the employees of the GWR who died during the war was unveiled by [[Victor Spencer, 1st Viscount Churchill|Viscount Churchill]]. The bronze memorial, depicting a soldier reading a letter, was sculpted by [[Charles Sargeant Jagger]] and stands on platform 1.<ref name=nramg/><ref name=GWRmag>{{cite news |url=http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/irs/irshome/features/readings/archive/remembrance.htm#EX04 |title=Great Western Railway War Memorial |work=The Great Western Railway Magazine |date=December 1922 |pages=537\u201340 |accessdate=9 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Big Four, British Rail and privatisation===\nThe GWR was the only railway company that continued through the [[Big Four (British railway companies)|Big Four]] grouping in 1923.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=303}} A tube railway for the Post Office, opened in December 1927, could cater for around 10,000 mailbags every day.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=319}}\n\nPaddington was extended again from 1930 to 1934. Platforms 2 to 11 were extended past the Bishop's Road bridge and a new parcel depot was built.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=319}} Suburban services, which had never been considered important at Paddington, were increased as new housing estates in the Home Counties started being built. Bishop's Road station was rebuilt, giving an extra four platforms to Paddington (Nos.&nbsp;13\u201316) and providing a new ticket office and entrance for suburban services next to the bridge.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=320}} A public address system was introduced in 1936.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=321}} By this time, around 22,000 parcels a day were being forwarded from Paddington, with the Royal Mail service processing around 4,500 mailbags and 2,400 parcel bags every day.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=91}}\n\nThe station came under attack several times during [[World War II]]. On 17 April 1941, the departure side of the station was hit by a parachute mine, while on 22 March 1944, the roof between platforms 6 and 7 was destroyed by two {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on}} flying bombs.{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=69}} Passenger traffic greatly increased through Paddington during the war, partly by evacuation to the relatively quiet [[Thames Valley]], and because holidaymakers chose to travel west as large areas of the south and east coasts had been taken over for military purposes. On 29 July 1944, the station was closed for three hours because the platforms were saturated with passenger traffic, while on the subsequent [[Bank holiday|August bank holiday]], crowds were controlled in tight queues along Eastbourne Terrace by mounted police.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=322}}\n\n[[File:Paddington_-_GWR_43187_meets_Brunel.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Statue of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]]]\nSteam traffic began to be replaced in the late 1950s. Between 1959 and 1961, suburban services switched to [[diesel multiple unit]]s, while the last regular long-distance steam train left Paddington on 11 June 1965.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=324}} The track layout was reorganised in 1967, abolishing the distinction between arrival and departure platforms that had been a feature of Paddington since opening. A new set of sidings was built south of Royal Oak, and the track curve into Paddington was eased. Services to the Midlands were rerouted via {{rws|Marylebone}} during this time. The station concourse was enlarged in 1970, and the ticket office was rebuilt in the same year.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=325}} By this time, public opinion had turned against wholesale demolition and redevelopment of stations such as Euston, and consequently the rebuilding work was done with an eye towards preserving Brunel and Wyatt's original station design.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=326}}{{sfn|Brindle|2004|p=94}} Special steam services began to be run from Paddington again in the 1980s.{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=370}}\n\nIn 1982, a bronze statue of Brunel was erected on the station concourse. It was sculpted by John Doubleday and funded by the [[Bristol and West Building Society]].{{sfn|Jackson|1984|p=369}} Between 1989 and 1999, the Lawn was re-roofed and separated from the concourse by a glass screen wall.

People here learn more about healthy behavior: they are encouraged to think about the pros of changing their behavior and to feel emotions about the effects of their negative behavior on others.\n\nPrecontemplators typically underestimate the pros of changing, overestimate the cons, and often are not aware of making such mistakes.\n\nOne of the most effective steps that others can help with at this stage is to encourage them to become more mindful of their decision making and more conscious of the multiple benefits of changing an unhealthy behavior.\n\n'''Stage 2: Contemplation''' (getting ready)\n\nAt this stage, participants are intending to start the healthy behavior within the next 6 months. While they are usually now more aware of the pros of changing, their cons are about equal to their Pros. This ambivalence about changing can cause them to keep putting off taking action.\n\nPeople here learn about the kind of person they could be if they changed their behavior and learn more from people who behave in healthy ways.\n\nOthers can influence and help effectively at this stage by encouraging them to work at reducing the cons of changing their behavior.\n\n'''Stage 3: Preparation''' (ready)\n\nPeople at this stage are ready to start taking action within the next 30 days. They take small steps that they believe can help them make the healthy behavior a part of their lives. For example, they tell their friends and family that they want to change their behavior.\n\nPeople in this stage should be encouraged to seek support from friends they trust, tell people about their plan to change the way they act, and think about how they would feel if they behaved in a healthier way. Their number one concern is: when they act, will they fail? They learn that the better prepared they are, the more likely they are to keep progressing.\n\n'''Stage 4: Action''' (current action)\n\nPeople at this stage have changed their behavior within the last 6 months and need to work hard to keep moving ahead. These participants need to learn how to strengthen their commitments to change and to fight urges to slip back.\n\nPeople in this stage progress by being taught techniques for keeping up their commitments such as substituting activities related to the unhealthy behavior with positive ones, rewarding themselves for taking steps toward changing, and avoiding people and situations that tempt them to behave in unhealthy ways.\n\n'''Stage 5: Maintenance''' (monitoring)\n\nPeople at this stage changed their behavior more than 6 months ago. It is important for people in this stage to be aware of situations that may tempt them to slip back into doing the unhealthy behavior\u2014particularly stressful situations.\n\nIt is recommended that people in this stage seek support from and talk with people whom they trust, spend time with people who behave in healthy ways, and remember to engage in healthy activities to cope with stress instead of relying on unhealthy behavior.\n\n'''Relapse''' (recycling)<ref name=\"springerlink.com\">DiClemente, CC; Prochaska, JO; Gibertini, M.

Individuals who attempt to quit highly addictive behaviors such as drug, alcohol, and tobacco use are at particularly high risk of a relapse.

TTM research has found the following relationships between the pros, cons, and the stage of change across 48 behaviors and over 100 populations studied.\n* The cons of changing outweigh the pros in the Precontemplation stage.\n* The pros surpass the cons in the middle stages.\n* The pros outweigh the cons in the Action stage.<ref name=HallRossi2008>{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = K.L. | last2 = Rossi | first2 = J.

The psychology of attitudes. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers, p. 1</ref> This means that by evaluating pros and cons we form a positive or negative attitude about something or someone.

The progression through the different stages of change is reflected in a gradual change in attitude before the individual acts. Most of the processes of change aim at evaluating and reevaluating as well as reinforcing specific elements of the current and target behaviour. The processes of change contribute to a great degree on attitude formation.\n\nDue to the synonymous use of decisional balance and attitude, travel behaviour researchers have begun to combine the TTM with the TPB.

A change in the level of self-efficacy can predict a lasting change in behavior if there are adequate incentives and skills. The transtheoretical model employs an overall confidence score to assess an individual's self-efficacy. Situational temptations assess how tempted people are to engage in a problem behavior in a certain situation.\n\n===Levels of change===\nThis core construct identifies the depth or complexity of presenting problems according to five levels of increasing complexity.<ref name=\"Prochaska2005\"/><ref name=\"Fromme2011\"/> Different therapeutic approaches are recommended for each level as well as for each stage of change.<ref name=\"Prochaska2005\"/><ref name=\"Prochaska1979\"/> The levels are:\n\n#Symptom/situational problems: e.g., [[motivational interviewing]], [[behavior therapy]], [[exposure therapy]]\n#Current maladaptive cognitions: e.g., [[Adlerian]] therapy, [[cognitive therapy]], [[rational emotive therapy]]\n#Current interpersonal conflicts: e.g., [[Harry Stack Sullivan|Sullivanian]] therapy, [[interpersonal therapy]]\n#Family/systems conflicts: e.g., [[strategic therapy]], [[Murray Bowen|Bowenian]] therapy, [[structural family therapy]]\n#Long-term intrapersonal conflicts: e.g., [[psychoanalytic]] therapies, [[existential therapy]], [[Gestalt therapy]]\n\n==Outcomes of programs==\n\nThe outcomes of the TTM computerized tailored interventions administered to participants in pre-Action stages are outlined below.\n\n===Stress management===\n\nA national sample of pre-Action adults was provided a stress management intervention. At the 18-month follow-up, a significantly larger proportion of the treatment group (62%) was effectively managing their stress when compared to the control group. The intervention also produced statistically significant reductions in stress and depression and an increase in the use of stress management techniques when compared to the control group.<ref>Evers, K.

The vast majority (73%) of the intervention group who were previously pre-Action were adhering to their prescribed medication regimen at the 12-month follow-up when compared to the control group.<ref>Johnson, S.

More than half of the intervention group (56%) who were previously pre-Action were adhering to their prescribed medication regimen at the 18-month follow-up. Additionally, only 15% of those in the intervention group who were already in Action or Maintenance relapsed into poor medication adherence compared to 45% of the controls. Further, participants who were at risk for physical activity and unhealthy diet were given only stage-based guidance. The treatment group doubled the control group in the percentage in Action or Maintenance at 18 months for physical activity (43%) and diet (25%).<ref>Johnson, S. S., Driskell, M. M., Johnson, J.

Patients receiving the TTM intervention experienced significantly greater symptom reduction during the 9-month follow-up period. The intervention's largest effects were observed among patients with moderate or severe depression, and who were in the Precontemplation or Contemplation stage of change at baseline. For example, among patients in the Precontemplation or Contemplation stage, rates of reliable and clinically significant improvement in depression were 40% for treatment and 9% for control. Among patients with mild depression, or who were in the Action or Maintenance stage at baseline, the intervention helped prevent disease progression to Major Depression during the follow-up period.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Levesque | first1 = D.

Those randomly assigned to the treatment group received a stage-matched multiple behavior change guide and a series of tailored, individualized interventions for three health behaviors that are crucial to effective weight management: healthy eating (i.e., reducing calorie and dietary fat intake), moderate exercise, and managing emotional distress without eating. Up to three tailored reports (one per behavior) were delivered based on assessments conducted at four time points: baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. All participants were followed up at 6, 12, and 24 months. Multiple Imputation was used to estimate missing data. Generalized Labor Estimating Equations (GLEE) were then used to examine differences between the treatment and comparison groups. At 24 months, those who were in a pre-Action stage for healthy eating at baseline and received treatment were significantly more likely to have reached Protons or Maintenance than the comparison group (47.5% vs. 34.3%). The intervention also impacted a related, but untreated behavior: fruit and vegetable consumption. Over 48% of those in the treatment group in a pre-Action stage at baseline progressed to Action or Maintenance for eating at least 5 servings a day of fruit and vegetables as opposed to 39% of the comparison group. Individuals in the treatment group who were in a pre-Action stage for exercise at baseline were also significantly more likely to reach Action or Maintenance (44.9% vs. 38.1%). The treatment also had a significant effect on managing emotional distress without eating, with 49.7% of those in a pre-Action stage at baseline moving to Action or Maintenance versus 30.3% of the comparison group. The groups differed on weight lost at 24 months among those in a pre-action stage for healthy eating and exercise at baseline. Among those in a pre-Action stage for both healthy eating and exercise at baseline, 30% of those randomized to the treatment group lost 5% or more of their body weight vs.18.6% in the comparison group. Coaction of behavior change occurred and was much more pronounced in the treatment group with the treatment group losing significantly more than the comparison group. This study demonstrates the ability of TTM-based tailored feedback to improve healthy eating, exercise, managing emotional distress, and weight on a population basis. The treatment produced the highest population impact to date on multiple health risk behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = S. S. | last2 = Paiva | first2 = A.

These may include: friends, books, and interactions with their healthcare providers. These factors could potentially influence how successful a patient may be in moving through the different stages. This stresses the importance to have continuous monitoring and efforts to maintain progress at each stage. TTM helps guide the treatment process at each stage, and may assist the healthcare provider in making an optimal therapeutic decision.\n\n=== Travel research ===\nThe use of TTM in travel behaviour interventions is rather novel. A number of cross-sectional studies investigated the individual constructs of TTM, e.g. stage of change, decisional balance and self-efficacy, with regards to transport mode choice. The cross-sectional studies identified both motivators and barriers at the different stages regarding biking, walking and public transport.<ref name=\":02\">Mutrie, N.; Carney, C.; Blamey, A.; Crawford, F.; Aitchison, T.; Whitelaw, A. \"Walk in to work out\":A randomised controlled trial of a self help intervention to promote active commuting.

Perceived barriers were e.g. personal fitness, time and the weather. This knowledge was used to design interventions that would address attitudes and misconceptions to encourage an increased use of bikes and walking. These interventions aim at changing people's travel behaviour towards more sustainable and more active transport modes.

A reduction in the number of cars on our roads solves other problems such as congestion, traffic noise and traffic accidents. By combining health and environment related purposes, the message becomes stronger. Additionally, by emphasising personal health, physical activity or even direct economic impact, people see a direct result from their changed behaviour, while saving the environment is a more general and effects are not directly noticeable.<ref>Cooper, C.

Health-centred intervention studies measured BMI, weight, waist circumference as well as general health. However, only one of three found a significant change in general health, while BMI and other measures had no effect.<ref name=\":02\" /> Measures that are associated with both health and sustainability were more common. Effects were reported as number of car trips, distance travelled, main mode share etc. Results varied due to greatly differing approaches. In general, car use could be reduced between 6% and 55%, while use of the alternative mode (walking, biking and/or public transport) increased between 11% and 150%.<ref name=\":12\"/> These results indicate a shift to action or maintenance stage, some researchers investigated attitude shifts such as the willingness to change. Attitudes towards using alternative modes improved with approximately 20% to 70%.<ref name=\":12\"/> Many of the intervention studies did not clearly differentiate between the five stages, but categorised participants in pre-action and action stage. This approach makes it difficult to assess the effects per stage. Also, interventions included different processes of change; in many cases these processes are not matched to the recommended stage.<ref name=\":12\"/> It highlights the need to develop a standardised approach for travel intervention design. Identifying and assessing which processes are most effective in the context of travel behaviour change should be a priority in the future in order to secure the role of TTM in travel behaviour research.\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe TTM has been called \"arguably the dominant model of health behaviour change, having received unprecedented research attention, yet it has simultaneously attracted criticism\".<ref name=\"Armitage\"/> Depending on the field of application (e.g. smoking cessation, substance abuse, condom use, diabetes treatment, obesity and travel) somewhat different criticisms have been raised.\n\nIn a [[systematic review]], published in 2003, of 23 [[randomized controlled trial]]s, the authors found that \"stage based interventions are no more effective than non-stage based interventions or no intervention in changing [[smoking]] behaviour.<ref>Riemsma, RP; Pattenden, J; Bridle, C; Sowden, AJ; Mather, L; Watt, IS; Walker, A.

Thus, criticism is directed towards the use rather the effectiveness of the model itself. Looking at interventions targeting smoking cessation in pregnancy found that stage-matched interventions were more effective than non-matched interventions. One reason for this was the greater intensity of stage-matched interventions.<ref>Aveyard, P; Lawrence, T; Cheng, KK; Griffin, C; Croghan, E; Johnson, C.

The study claims that those not wanting to change (i.e. precontemplators) tend to be responsive to neither stage nor non-stage based interventions. Since stage-based interventions tend to be more intensive they appear to be most effective at targeting contemplators and above rather than pre-contemplators.<ref>Aveyard, P; Massey, L; Parsons, A; Manaseki, S; Griffin, C. {{doi|10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.10.036|The effect of transtheoretical model based interventions on smoking cessation.}} Soc Sci Med 2009 Feb;68(3):397\u2013403.

In this study, the algorithms and questionnaires that researchers used to assign people to stages of change lacked standardisation to be compared empirically, or validated.<ref>Sallis, J. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2879180/ Physical Activity and Food Environments: Solutions to the Obesity Epidemic.] Milbank Q. 2009 Mar; 87(1): 123\u2013154.

The processes used to build the intervention are rarely stage-matched and short cuts are taken by classifying participants in a pre-action stage, which summarises the precontemplation, contemplation and preparation stage, and an action/maintenance stage.<ref name=\":12\" /> More generally, TTM has been criticised within various domains due to the limitations in the research designs. For example, many studies supporting the model have been [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]], but [[longitudinal study]] data would allow for stronger causal inferences. Another point of criticism is raised in a 2002 review, where the model's stages were characterized as \"not mutually exclusive\".<ref name=\":32\">Littell, JH; Girvin, H.

People here learn more about healthy behavior: they are encouraged to think about the pros of changing their behavior and to feel emotions about the effects of their negative behavior on others.\n\nPrecontemplators typically underestimate the pros of changing, overestimate the cons, and often are not aware of making such mistakes.\n\nOne of the most effective steps that others can help with at this stage is to encourage them to become more mindful of their decision making and more conscious of the multiple benefits of changing an unhealthy behavior.\n\n'''Stage 2: Contemplation''' (getting ready)\n\nAt this stage, participants are intending to start the healthy behavior within the next 6 months. While they are usually now more aware of the pros of changing, their cons are about equal to their Pros. This ambivalence about changing can cause them to keep putting off taking action.\n\nPeople here learn about the kind of person they could be if they changed their behavior and learn more from people who behave in healthy ways.\n\nOthers can influence and help effectively at this stage by encouraging them to work at reducing the cons of changing their behavior.\n\n'''Stage 3: Preparation''' (ready)\n\nPeople at this stage are ready to start taking action within the next 30 days. They take small steps that they believe can help them make the healthy behavior a part of their lives. For example, they tell their friends and family that they want to change their behavior.\n\nPeople in this stage should be encouraged to seek support from friends they trust, tell people about their plan to change the way they act, and think about how they would feel if they behaved in a healthier way. Their number one concern is: when they act, will they fail? They learn that the better prepared they are, the more likely they are to keep progressing.\n\n'''Stage 4: Action''' (current action)\n\nPeople at this stage have changed their behavior within the last 6 months and need to work hard to keep moving ahead. These participants need to learn how to strengthen their commitments to change and to fight urges to slip back.\n\nPeople in this stage progress by being taught techniques for keeping up their commitments such as substituting activities related to the unhealthy behavior with positive ones, rewarding themselves for taking steps toward changing, and avoiding people and situations that tempt them to behave in unhealthy ways.\n\n'''Stage 5: Maintenance''' (monitoring)\n\nPeople at this stage changed their behavior more than 6 months ago. It is important for people in this stage to be aware of situations that may tempt them to slip back into doing the unhealthy behavior\u2014particularly stressful situations.\n\nIt is recommended that people in this stage seek support from and talk with people whom they trust, spend time with people who behave in healthy ways, and remember to engage in healthy activities to cope with stress instead of relying on unhealthy behavior.\n\n'''Relapse''' (recycling)<ref name=\"springerlink.com\">DiClemente, CC; Prochaska, JO; Gibertini, M.

Individuals who attempt to quit highly addictive behaviors such as drug, alcohol, and tobacco use are at particularly high risk of a relapse. Achieving a long-term behavior change often requires ongoing support from family members, a health coach, a physician, or another motivational source. Supportive literature and other resources can also be helpful to avoid a relapse from happening.\n\n===Processes of change===\n[[File:Processes of Change 3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Processes of change]]\nThe 10 processes of change are \"covert and overt activities that people use to progress through the stages\".<ref name=ProchaskaAJHP97/>\n\nTo progress through the early stages, people apply cognitive, affective, and evaluative processes.

(1977) Decision making: a psychological analysis of conflict, choice and commitment. New York: Free Press. {{ISBN|0-02-916160-6}}</ref> Decisional balance measures, the pros and the cons, have become critical constructs in the transtheoretical model. The pros and cons combine to form a decisional \"balance sheet\" of comparative potential gains and losses. The balance between the pros and cons varies depending on which stage of change the individual is in.\n\nSound decision making requires the consideration of the potential benefits (pros) and costs (cons) associated with a behavior's consequences. TTM research has found the following relationships between the pros, cons, and the stage of change across 48 behaviors and over 100 populations studied.\n* The cons of changing outweigh the pros in the Precontemplation stage.\n* The pros surpass the cons in the middle stages.\n* The pros outweigh the cons in the Action stage.<ref name=HallRossi2008>Hall, K.L. & Rossi, J. S. (2008) Meta-analysis Examination of the sting and weak principals across 48 behaviors. Preventative Medicine, 46, 266-274.</ref>\n\nThe evaluation of pros and cons is part of the formation of attitudes. [[Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]] is defined as a \"psychological tendency that is expressed by evaluating a particular entity with some degree of favour or disfavour\".<ref>Eagly, A.H., Chaiken, S., 1993. The psychology of attitudes. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers, p. 1</ref> This means that by evaluating pros and cons we form a positive or negative attitude about something or someone. During the change process individuals gradually shift from cons to pros, forming a more positive attitude towards the target behaviour. Attitudes are one of the core constructs explaining behaviour and behaviour change in various research domains.<ref>Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., 1989. The Degree of Intention Formation as a Moderator of the Attitude-Behavior Relationship. Social Psychology Quarterly 52, 266-279.</ref> Other behaviour models, such as the [[theory of planned behavior]] (TPB)<ref>Ajzen, I., 1991. The theory of planned behavior.

Changing environmentally harmful behaviors: A stage model of self-regulated behavioral change. Journal of Environmental Psychology 34, 151-159.</ref> also emphasise attitude as an important determinant of behaviour. The progression through the different stages of change is reflected in a gradual change in attitude before the individual acts. Most of the processes of change aim at evaluating and reevaluating as well as reinforcing specific elements of the current and target behaviour. The processes of change contribute to a great degree on attitude formation.\n\nDue to the synonymous use of decisional balance and attitude, travel behaviour researchers have begun to combine the TTM with the TPB. Forward<ref name=\":5\">Forward, S.E., 2014. Exploring people's willingness to bike using a combination of the theory of planned behavioural and the transtheoretical model.

Especially all TPB variables (attitude, perceived behaviour control, descriptive and subjective norm) are positively show a gradually increasing relationship to stage of change for bike commuting. As expected, intention or willingness to perform the behaviour increases by stage.<ref name=\":5\" /> Similarly, Bamberg<ref name=\":6\" /> uses various behavior models, including the transtheoretical model, theory of planned behavior and norm-activation model, to build the stage model of self-regulated behavior change (SSBC). Bamberg claims that his model is a solution to criticism raised towards the TTM.<ref name=\":6\" /> Some researchers in travel, dietary, and environmental research have conducted empirical studies, showing that the SSBC might be a future path for TTM-based research.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>Kl\u00f6ckner, C.A., 2017.

In the 1992 version of the model, Prochaska et al. mention \"self-efficacy\" but in only one sentence under the \"key transtheoretical concept\" of \"stages of change\".</ref> The construct is based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory and conceptualizes a person's perceived ability to perform on a task as a mediator of performance on future tasks.<ref>Prochaska, J.O., Velicer, W.F., 1997.

''Psychological Review'', ''84''(2), 191-216.</ref> In his research Bandura already established that greater levels of perceived self-efficacy leads to greater changes in behavior.<ref name=\":7\" /> Similarly, Ajzen mentions the similarity between the concepts of self-efficacy and perceived behavioral control.<ref>Ajzen, I. (2002), Perceived Behavioral Control, Self-Efficacy, Locus of Control, and the Theory of Planned Behavior [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb00236.x/full#fn1 1].

A change in the level of self-efficacy can predict a lasting change in behavior if there are adequate incentives and skills. The transtheoretical model employs an overall confidence score to assess an individual's self-efficacy. Situational temptations assess how tempted people are to engage in a problem behavior in a certain situation.\n\n===Levels of change===\nThis core construct identifies the depth or complexity of presenting problems according to five levels of increasing complexity.<ref name=\"Prochaska2005\"/><ref name=\"Fromme2011\"/> Different therapeutic approaches are recommended for each level as well as for each stage of change.<ref name=\"Prochaska2005\"/><ref name=\"Prochaska1979\"/> The levels are:\n\n#Symptom/situational problems: e.g., [[motivational interviewing]], [[behavior therapy]], [[exposure therapy]]\n#Current maladaptive cognitions: e.g., [[Adlerian]] therapy, [[cognitive therapy]], [[rational emotive therapy]]\n#Current interpersonal conflicts: e.g., [[Harry Stack Sullivan|Sullivanian]] therapy, [[interpersonal therapy]]\n#Family/systems conflicts: e.g., [[strategic therapy]], [[Murray Bowen|Bowenian]] therapy, [[structural family therapy]]\n#Long-term intrapersonal conflicts: e.g., [[psychoanalytic]] therapies, [[existential therapy]], [[Gestalt therapy]]\n\n==Outcomes of programs==\n\nThe outcomes of the TTM computerized tailored interventions administered to participants in pre-Action stages are outlined below.\n\n===Stress management===\n\nA national sample of pre-Action adults was provided a stress management intervention. At the 18-month follow-up, a significantly larger proportion of the treatment group (62%) was effectively managing their stress when compared to the control group. The intervention also produced statistically significant reductions in stress and depression and an increase in the use of stress management techniques when compared to the control group.<ref>Evers, K.

The vast majority (73%) of the intervention group who were previously pre-Action were adhering to their prescribed medication regimen at the 12-month follow-up when compared to the control group.<ref>Johnson, S.

More than half of the intervention group (56%) who were previously pre-Action were adhering to their prescribed medication regimen at the 18-month follow-up. Additionally, only 15% of those in the intervention group who were already in Action or Maintenance relapsed into poor medication adherence compared to 45% of the controls. Further, participants who were at risk for physical activity and unhealthy diet were given only stage-based guidance. The treatment group doubled the control group in the percentage in Action or Maintenance at 18 months for physical activity (43%) and diet (25%).<ref>Johnson, S. S., Driskell, M. M., Johnson, J.

Patients receiving the TTM intervention experienced significantly greater symptom reduction during the 9-month follow-up period. The intervention's largest effects were observed among patients with moderate or severe depression, and who were in the Precontemplation or Contemplation stage of change at baseline. For example, among patients in the Precontemplation or Contemplation stage, rates of reliable and clinically significant improvement in depression were 40% for treatment and 9% for control. Among patients with mild depression, or who were in the Action or Maintenance stage at baseline, the intervention helped prevent disease progression to Major Depression during the follow-up period.<ref>Levesque, D. A., Van Marter, D. F., Schneider, R. J., Bauer, M. R., Goldberg, D. N., Prochaska, J. O., & Prochaska, J. M. (2011). Randomized trial of a computer-tailored intervention for patients with depression. ''American Journal of Health Promotion'', ''26''(2), 77-89.</ref>\n\n===Weight management===\n\nFive-hundred-and-seventy-seven overweight or moderately obese adults (BMI 25-39.9) were recruited nationally, primarily from large employers. Those randomly assigned to the treatment group received a stage-matched multiple behavior change guide and a series of tailored, individualized interventions for three health behaviors that are crucial to effective weight management: healthy eating (i.e., reducing calorie and dietary fat intake), moderate exercise, and managing emotional distress without eating. Up to three tailored reports (one per behavior) were delivered based on assessments conducted at four time points: baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. All participants were followed up at 6, 12, and 24 months. Multiple Imputation was used to estimate missing data. Generalized Labor Estimating Equations (GLEE) were then used to examine differences between the treatment and comparison groups. At 24 months, those who were in a pre-Action stage for healthy eating at baseline and received treatment were significantly more likely to have reached Protons or Maintenance than the comparison group (47.5% vs. 34.3%). The intervention also impacted a related, but untreated behavior: fruit and vegetable consumption. Over 48% of those in the treatment group in a pre-Action stage at baseline progressed to Action or Maintenance for eating at least 5 servings a day of fruit and vegetables as opposed to 39% of the comparison group. Individuals in the treatment group who were in a pre-Action stage for exercise at baseline were also significantly more likely to reach Action or Maintenance (44.9% vs. 38.1%). The treatment also had a significant effect on managing emotional distress without eating, with 49.7% of those in a pre-Action stage at baseline moving to Action or Maintenance versus 30.3% of the comparison group. The groups differed on weight lost at 24 months among those in a pre-action stage for healthy eating and exercise at baseline. Among those in a pre-Action stage for both healthy eating and exercise at baseline, 30% of those randomized to the treatment group lost 5% or more of their body weight vs.18.6% in the comparison group. Coaction of behavior change occurred and was much more pronounced in the treatment group with the treatment group losing significantly more than the comparison group. This study demonstrates the ability of TTM-based tailored feedback to improve healthy eating, exercise, managing emotional distress, and weight on a population basis. The treatment produced the highest population impact to date on multiple health risk behaviors.<ref>Johnson, S. S., Paiva, A. L., Cummins, C. O., Johnson, J. L., Dyment, S. J., Wright, J.

These may include: friends, books, and interactions with their healthcare providers. These factors could potentially influence how successful a patient may be in moving through the different stages. This stresses the importance to have continuous monitoring and efforts to maintain progress at each stage. TTM helps guide the treatment process at each stage, and may assist the healthcare provider in making an optimal therapeutic decision.\n\n=== Travel research ===\nThe use of TTM in travel behaviour interventions is rather novel. A number of cross-sectional studies investigated the individual constructs of TTM, e.g. stage of change, decisional balance and self-efficacy, with regards to transport mode choice. The cross-sectional studies identified both motivators and barriers at the different stages regarding biking, walking and public transport.<ref name=\":02\">Mutrie, N.; Carney, C.; Blamey, A.; Crawford, F.; Aitchison, T.; Whitelaw, A. \"Walk in to work out\":A randomised controlled trial of a self help intervention to promote active commuting.

Perceived barriers were e.g. personal fitness, time and the weather. This knowledge was used to design interventions that would address attitudes and misconceptions to encourage an increased use of bikes and walking. These interventions aim at changing people's travel behaviour towards more sustainable and more active transport modes.

A reduction in the number of cars on our roads solves other problems such as congestion, traffic noise and traffic accidents. By combining health and environment related purposes, the message becomes stronger. Additionally, by emphasising personal health, physical activity or even direct economic impact, people see a direct result from their changed behaviour, while saving the environment is a more general and effects are not directly noticeable.<ref>Cooper, C.

Health-centred intervention studies measured BMI, weight, waist circumference as well as general health. However, only one of three found a significant change in general health, while BMI and other measures had no effect.<ref name=\":02\" /> Measures that are associated with both health and sustainability were more common. Effects were reported as number of car trips, distance travelled, main mode share etc. Results varied due to greatly differing approaches. In general, car use could be reduced between 6% and 55%, while use of the alternative mode (walking, biking and/or public transport) increased between 11% and 150%.<ref name=\":12\"/> These results indicate a shift to action or maintenance stage, some researchers investigated attitude shifts such as the willingness to change. Attitudes towards using alternative modes improved with approximately 20% to 70%.<ref name=\":12\"/> Many of the intervention studies did not clearly differentiate between the five stages, but categorised participants in pre-action and action stage. This approach makes it difficult to assess the effects per stage. Also, interventions included different processes of change; in many cases these processes are not matched to the recommended stage.<ref name=\":12\"/> It highlights the need to develop a standardised approach for travel intervention design. Identifying and assessing which processes are most effective in the context of travel behaviour change should be a priority in the future in order to secure the role of TTM in travel behaviour research.\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe TTM has been called \"arguably the dominant model of health behaviour change, having received unprecedented research attention, yet it has simultaneously attracted criticism\".<ref name=\"Armitage\"/> Depending on the field of application (e.g. smoking cessation, substance abuse, condom use, diabetes treatment, obesity and travel) somewhat different criticisms have been raised.\n\nIn a [[systematic review]], published in 2003, of 23 [[randomized controlled trial]]s, the authors found that \"stage based interventions are no more effective than non-stage based interventions or no intervention in changing [[smoking]] behaviour.<ref>Riemsma, RP; Pattenden, J; Bridle, C; Sowden, AJ; Mather, L; Watt, IS; Walker, A.

Accessed 2009 Mar 18.</ref> However, it was also mentioned that stage based interventions are often used and implemented inadequately in practice. Thus, criticism is directed towards the use rather the effectiveness of the model itself. Looking at interventions targeting smoking cessation in pregnancy found that stage-matched interventions were more effective than non-matched interventions. One reason for this was the greater intensity of stage-matched interventions.<ref>Aveyard, P; Lawrence, T; Cheng, KK; Griffin, C; Croghan, E; Johnson, C.

The study claims that those not wanting to change (i.e. precontemplators) tend to be responsive to neither stage nor non-stage based interventions. Since stage-based interventions tend to be more intensive they appear to be most effective at targeting contemplators and above rather than pre-contemplators.<ref>Aveyard, P; Massey, L; Parsons, A; Manaseki, S; Griffin, C.

West claimed that a more coherent and distinguishable definition for the stages is needed.<ref name=\"West 2005\"/> Especially the fact that the stages are bound to a specific time interval is perceived to be misleading. Additionally, the effectiveness of stage-based interventions differs depending on the behavior. A continuous version of the model has been proposed, where each process is first increasingly used, and then decreases in importance, as smokers make progress along some latent dimension.<ref>{{cite journal |last=No\u00ebl |first=Yvonnick |date=June 1999 |title=Recovering unimodal latent patterns of change by unfolding analysis: application to smoking cessation |journal=[[Psychological Methods]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=173\u2013191 |doi=10.1037/1082-989X.4.2.173}}</ref> This proposal suggests the use of processes without reference to stages of change.\n\nThe model \"assumes that individuals typically make coherent and stable plans\", when in fact they often do not.<ref name=\"West 2005\"/>\n\nWithin research on prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases a systematic review from 2003 comes to the conclusion that \"no strong conclusions\" can be drawn about the effectiveness of interventions based on the transtheoretical model.<ref name=\":2\">Horowitz, SM.

Applying the transtheoretical model to exercise: a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature. Health promotion practice 7, 428-443.</ref> A 2011 Cochrane Systematic Review found that there is little evidence to suggest that using the Transtheoretical Model Stages of Change (TTM SOC) method is effective in helping obese and overweight people lose weight. Earlier in a 2009 paper, the TTM was considered to be useful in promoting physical activity. In this study, the algorithms and questionnaires that researchers used to assign people to stages of change lacked standardisation to be compared empirically, or validated.<ref>Sallis, J.

The processes used to build the intervention are rarely stage-matched and short cuts are taken by classifying participants in a pre-action stage, which summarises the precontemplation, contemplation and preparation stage, and an action/maintenance stage.<ref name=\":12\" /> More generally, TTM has been criticised within various domains due to the limitations in the research designs. For example, many studies supporting the model have been [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]], but [[longitudinal study]] data would allow for stronger causal inferences. Another point of criticism is raised in a 2002 review, where the model's stages were characterized as \"not mutually exclusive\".<ref name=\":32\">Littell, JH; Girvin, H.

Latent transition analysis to the stages of change for smoking cessation. Addictive Behaviors 1996, 21(1):67-80</ref> Due to the variations in use, implementation and type of research designs, data confirming TTM are ambiguous.
