She is known for her work in television movies, and portrayal of troubled women in dramas. Burstyn is the recipient of various accolades, and is among the few performers to have won [[Triple Crown of Acting|Academy, Emmy and Tony Awards]].\n\nBorn in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], Burstyn left school and worked as a dancer and model. She made her stage debut on Broadway in 1957 and soon started to make appearances in television shows. Stardom followed soon after with her acclaimed role in ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971), which earned her an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. Her next appearance in ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973)'','' earned her a second Best Actress nomination. The film has remained popular and several publications have regarded it as [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest horror films of all time]]. She also starred in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' (1974), which won her the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nShe appeared in numerous television movies and gained further recognition from her performances in ''[[Same Time, Next Year (film)|Same Time, Next Year]]'' (1978), which won her a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award'','']] and ''[[Resurrection (1980 film)|Resurrection]]'' (1980)'', [[How to Make an American Quilt]]'' (1995)'','' and ''[[Requiem for a Dream|Requiem For a Dream]]'' (2000)''.'' For playing a lonely drug-addicted woman in the last one of these, she was again nominated for an Academy Award and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role|Screen Actors Guild Award]]. In the 2010s, she made appearances in television series including the political dramas, ''[[Political Animals (miniseries)|Political Animals]]'' and ''[[House of Cards (American TV series)|House of Cards]]'', which have earned her Emmy Award nominations. Since 2000, she has been co-president of the [[Actors Studio]], a drama school in [[New York City]]. In 2013, she was inducted into the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]] for her work on stage. \n\n==Early life==\nBurstyn was born Edna Rae Gillooly in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the daughter of Correine Marie ([[married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Hamel) and John Austin Gillooly.<ref name=lessons>{{cite book| last=Burstyn| first=Ellen |title=Lessons in Becoming Myself| year=2007| publisher=Penguin| isbn=1-594-48268-3| page=4}}</ref> She has described her ancestry as \"Irish, French, [[Pennsylvania Dutch]], a little [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian Indian]]\".<ref name=clark>Clark, John (October 19, 2009).[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/62762742.html?dids=62762742:62762742&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Oct+19%2C+2000&author=JOHN+CLARK&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Movies%3B+Independent+Minded%3B+Academy+Award+winner+Ellen+Burstyn%2C+a+'tough+cookie%2C'+is+back+with+two+gritty+films+and+a+TV+show.&pqatl=google Movies; Independent Minded; Academy Award Winner Ellen Burstyn, \"A 'Tough Cookie', Is Back with Two Gritty Films and a TV Show\"]([[Abstract (summary)|Abstract]]; {{subscription}} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115195009/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/62762742.html?dids=62762742:62762742&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Oct+19%2C+2000&author=JOHN+CLARK&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Movies%3B+Independent+Minded%3B+Academy+Award+winner+Ellen+Burstyn%2C+a+'tough+cookie%2C'+is+back+with+two+gritty+films+and+a+TV+show.&pqatl=google |date=January 15, 2013 }} for full article).

He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

Personally, I know it ripped the heart out of Brian, but having said that, he was in great spirits after the album was finished.\"<ref name=\"Jackson2011\"/> ''Back to the Light'' featured the single \"[[Too Much Love Will Kill You]]\", on which he collaborated as a songwriter with [[Frank Musker]] and Elizabeth Lamers. A version with Freddie Mercury's vocals was later released on the Queen album ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' and won the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Best Song Musically & Lyrically in 1996.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|author=Nigel Hunter|title=Anniversaries Abound at Novello Awards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48|date=21 June 1997|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=48}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1992, [[the Brian May Band]] was officially formed. An earlier version of the band had been loosely formed for 19&nbsp;October 1991, when May took part in the Guitar Legends guitar festival in [[Seville]], Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jazzbluesrock.online/2018/12/guitar-legends-expo-92-sevilla/ |title=Guitar Legends \u2013 Expo \u201992 Sevilla |website=jazzbluesrock.online |url-status=live |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band was together only during the South American support tour (supporting [[The B-52's]] and [[Joe Cocker]]) on five dates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Patrick|title=The Queen Chronology|date=2018|publisher=Lulu|page=137|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, May made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan. After the tour ended on 18&nbsp;December 1993, May returned to the studio with fellow surviving Queen band members Roger Taylor and [[John Deacon]] to work on tracks that became ''Made in Heaven'', the final Queen studio album.<ref name=\"Buckley\">Buckley, Peter (2003). \"The Rough Guide to Rock\". p.837.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the Guns N' Roses song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well.

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

An earlier version of the band had been loosely formed for 19&nbsp;October 1991, when May took part in the Guitar Legends guitar festival in [[Seville]], Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jazzbluesrock.online/2018/12/guitar-legends-expo-92-sevilla/ |title=Guitar Legends \u2013 Expo \u201992 Sevilla |website=jazzbluesrock.online |url-status=live |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band was together only during the South American support tour (supporting [[The B-52's]] and [[Joe Cocker]]) on five dates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Patrick|title=The Queen Chronology|date=2018|publisher=Lulu|page=137|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, May made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan. After the tour ended on 18&nbsp;December 1993, May returned to the studio with fellow surviving Queen band members Roger Taylor and [[John Deacon]] to work on tracks that became ''Made in Heaven'', the final Queen studio album.<ref name=\"Buckley\">Buckley, Peter (2003). \"The Rough Guide to Rock\". p.837.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.

However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

The most famous replicas were made by John Birch in 1975 (May actually smashed it during a concert in the States in 1982), [[Greco guitars|Greco]] BM90 (featured in the promo video of \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\" in 1977), Guild (back-up from 1984 to 1993), Fryers (1997\u20131998, used both live and in the studio) and Guyton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/rsintro.php |title=Guitar Builder (Luthier) in East Anglia, UK \u2013 High Quality Hand Made Custom Electric Guitars by Andrew Guyton |publisher=Guytonguitars.com |accessdate=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203025707/http://www.guytonguitars.com/rsintro.php |archivedate=3 February 2014 }}</ref> (back-up from 2003 to present).

May used a Gibson Chet-Atkins guitar on the 1986 Magic Tour.<ref name=\"MR\"/>\n*In 2012 he received a double-neck replica of the Red Special with the second neck having 12-strings.

On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"[[Teo Torriatte]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/queen/songs/a-day-at-the-races.htm |title=A Day At The Races |website=ultimatequeen.co.uk |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"The Prophet's Song\"]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=gZ5ZCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=may+mini+koto+prophets+song&source=bl&ots=Q2wEPJDBsB&sig=ACfU3U0yjtTueqXty7NPHUjjdkv2NJqqUw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiG3Lu70t7oAhVWG80KHSjiCoYQ6AEwCXoECBIQKw#v=onepage&q=may%20mini%20koto%20prophets%20song&f=false |title=The Bible in Music: A Dictionary of Songs, Works, and More |last=Long |first= Siobh\u00e1n Dowling  |last2=Sawyer |first2=John F.A. |website=books.google.ca |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |page=189 |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].

It is a humorous take on [[role-playing games]], based on the concept of [[munchkin (role-playing games)|munchkin]]s (immature role-players, playing only to \"win\" by having the most powerful character possible).\n\n''Munchkin'' won the 2001 [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Traditional Card Game'',<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2001/list-of-winners|title=Origins Award Winners (2001)| publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design| accessdate=2007-10-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080202042430/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2001/list-of-winners <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-02}}</ref> and is itself a spin-off of ''The Munchkin's Guide to Powergaming'', a gaming humor book which also won an Origins Award in 2000.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2000/list-of-winners|title=Origins Award Winners (2000)| publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design| accessdate=2007-10-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080415213159/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2000/list-of-winners <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-15}}</ref>\n\nAfter the success of the original ''Munchkin'' game several expansion packs and sequels were published.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/|title=Munchkin home page| publisher=Steve Jackson Games| accessdate=2007-12-23}}</ref> Now available in 15 different languages, ''Munchkin'' accounted for more than 70% of the 2007 sales for Steve Jackson Games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjgames.com/general/stakeholders/report08.html|title=2008 Report to the Stakeholders|publisher=Steve Jackson Games|accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn ''Munchkin'', all players start at level 1, with the goal of reaching level 10 (or level 20 in Epic Level games). Players primarily progress by killing monsters, and level up every time they kill a monster. However, players can freely use cards against monsters and other players during play, allowing them to either assist or to sabotage others during their turn. Each person's turn begins when they \"kick down the door\" by drawing a Door Card face-up. A Door Card can be one of the following types: a Monster Card, which the player must engage by fighting or fleeing; a Curse Card, which applies an effect; or an Item Card, Race Card, or Class Card, which the player adds to their hand. If the card drawn is not a Monster Card, the player can either \"loot the room\" by drawing a face-down door card and adding it to their hand, or \"look for trouble\" by playing a Monster Card from their hand to fight it.\n\nWhen fighting a monster, the total level of the player (and any supporting players) is weighed against the total level of the monster(s) to determine the victor. A successful player draws the listed amount of treasure cards and levels up either 1 or 2 levels, but an unsuccessful character must roll the dice to try and flee; players who fail to roll a five or six suffer the monster's negative effects (\"Bad Stuff\") or die. Should a player die, their turn immediately ends and they discard their hand, retaining their player level but drawing a new hand for equipment.\n\nDue to the highly competitive nature of the game and the presence of rule-breaking cards, players are encouraged to use unfair tactics against others, to act [[mercenary]] to further themselves at the expense of others, or to use cheat cards to affect outcomes (such as fixing the roll of the die). Throughout a player's turn, others are free to intervene: they can passively [[status effect|buff or debuff]] the player or monsters to alter the outcome; play monster cards of matching types to make the battle more difficult; or offer to assist the player, typically in exchange for treasure cards.\n\n[[File:Munchkin card game being played, March 2014.jpeg|thumb|A game of Munchkin being played, with coins being used to denote levels.]]\n\nOther cards that can enter play include Items, which can be used in combat, Treasure Cards, which act as sellable loot and equipment, and Curse Cards, which apply effects. Additionally, players can equip certain cards (such as armor and weapons) to raise their total level and kill stronger monsters, and can use Class Cards and Race Cards to grant extra abilities or advantages at the cost of a balanced weakness; for example, the elf race can level when helping others kill monsters, but will take additional damage from disgusting enemies.\n\nStandard games typically last around an hour, with the game ending once a player reaches the target level and wins the match. Aside from defeating monsters, players can progress through indirect means such as selling cards (with every 1000 Gold on the sum total granting a level) or by playing special leveling cards. Most games disallow victory through indirect methods, meaning only fighting a monster can win the game. There are a few exceptions, however, such as when a player uses cards that specifically state they override rules.\n\n==Variants, Expansions & Accessories==\n===Variants===\nThese are themed \"box set\" editions of MUNCHKIN that have been released. (The overall theme parodied by each set is after the title.) Each is a stand-alone version that can be played separately or combined with any other version for a more expansive game. Most of these editions were illustrated by [[John Kovalic]], although some were done by other artists (who are noted if applicable). Some of these have been released in Deluxe versions (which include a gameboard and movers to keep track of levels) and/or Guest Artist Editions (drawn with new art by artists other than those who originally drew them). Certain versions have been co-produced with [[USAopoly]] and/or [[IDW Games]], and feature \"character cards\" that grant starting powers and keep track of levels.

It is a humorous take on [[role-playing games]], based on the concept of [[munchkin (role-playing games)|munchkin]]s (immature role-players, playing only to \"win\" by having the most powerful character possible).\n\n''Munchkin'' won the 2001 [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Traditional Card Game'',<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2001/list-of-winners|title=Origins Award Winners (2001)| publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design| accessdate=2007-10-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080202042430/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2001/list-of-winners <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-02}}</ref> and is itself a spin-off of ''The Munchkin's Guide to Powergaming'', a gaming humor book which also won an Origins Award in 2000.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2000/list-of-winners|title=Origins Award Winners (2000)| publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design| accessdate=2007-10-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080415213159/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2000/list-of-winners <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-15}}</ref>\n\nAfter the success of the original ''Munchkin'' game several expansion packs and sequels were published.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/|title=Munchkin home page| publisher=Steve Jackson Games| accessdate=2007-12-23}}</ref> Now available in 15 different languages, ''Munchkin'' accounted for more than 70% of the 2007 sales for Steve Jackson Games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjgames.com/general/stakeholders/report08.html|title=2008 Report to the Stakeholders|publisher=Steve Jackson Games|accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn ''Munchkin'', all players start at level 1, with the goal of reaching level 10 (or level 20 in Epic Level games). Players primarily progress by killing monsters, and level up every time they kill a monster. However, players can freely use cards against monsters and other players during play, allowing them to either assist or to sabotage others during their turn. Each person's turn begins when they \"kick down the door\" by drawing a Door Card face-up. A Door Card can be one of the following types: a Monster Card, which the player must engage by fighting or fleeing; a Curse Card, which applies an effect; or an Item Card, Race Card, or Class Card, which the player adds to their hand. If the card drawn is not a Monster Card, the player can either \"loot the room\" by drawing a face-down door card and adding it to their hand, or \"look for trouble\" by playing a Monster Card from their hand to fight it.\n\nWhen fighting a monster, the total level of the player (and any supporting players) is weighed against the total level of the monster(s) to determine the victor. A successful player draws the listed amount of treasure cards and levels up either 1 or 2 levels, but an unsuccessful character must roll the dice to try and flee; players who fail to roll a five or six suffer the monster's negative effects (\"Bad Stuff\") or die. Should a player die, their turn immediately ends and they discard their hand, retaining their player level but drawing a new hand for equipment.\n\nDue to the highly competitive nature of the game and the presence of rule-breaking cards, players are encouraged to use unfair tactics against others, to act [[mercenary]] to further themselves at the expense of others, or to use cheat cards to affect outcomes (such as fixing the roll of the die). Throughout a player's turn, others are free to intervene: they can passively [[status effect|buff or debuff]] the player or monsters to alter the outcome; play monster cards of matching types to make the battle more difficult; or offer to assist the player, typically in exchange for treasure cards.\n\n[[File:Munchkin card game being played , March 2014.jpeg|thumb|A game of Munchkin being played, with coins being used to denote levels.]]\n\nOther cards that can enter play include Items, which can be used in combat, Treasure Cards, which act as sellable loot and equipment, and Curse Cards, which apply effects. Additionally, players can equip certain cards (such as armor and weapons) to raise their total level and kill stronger monsters, and can use Class Cards and Race Cards to grant extra abilities or advantages at the cost of a balanced weakness; for example, the elf race can level when helping others kill monsters, but will take additional damage from disgusting enemies.\n\nStandard games typically last around an hour, with the game ending once a player reaches the target level and wins the match. Aside from defeating monsters, players can progress though indirect means such as selling cards (with every 1000 Gold on the sum total granting a level) or by playing special leveling cards. Most games disallow victory through indirect methods, meaning only fighting a monster can win the game. There are a few exceptions, however, such as when a player uses cards which specifically state they override rules.\n\n==Variants, Expansions & Accessories==\n===Variants===\nThese are themed \"box set\" editions of MUNCHKIN that have been released. (The overall theme parodied by each set is after the title.) Each is a stand-alone version that can be played separately or combined with any other version for a more expansive game. Most of these editions were illustrated by [[John Kovalic]], although some were done by other artists (who are noted if applicable). Some of these have been released in Deluxe versions (which include a gameboard and movers to keep track of levels) and/or Guest Artist Editions (drawn with new art by artists other than those who originally drew them). Certain versions have been co-produced with [[USAopoly]] and/or [[IDW Games]], and feature \"character cards\" that grant starting powers and keep track of levels.
