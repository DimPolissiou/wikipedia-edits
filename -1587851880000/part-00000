It was widely produced by [[Oerlikon Contraves]] and others, with various models employed by both Allied and Axis forces during [[World War II]], and many versions are still in use today.<ref name=\"NAVWEAP1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_2cm-70_mk234.htm |title=Switzerland Oerlikon 20 mm/70 (0.79\") Mark 1\" |website=NavWeaps.com |date=14 January 2011 |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"NAVWEAP2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_2cm-85_GAM.htm |title=Britain 20 mm/85 (0.79\") GAM-BO1 |website=NavWeaps.com |date=21 June 2008 |accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n\n===Oerlikon===\nIn 1927 the ''Oerlikon S'' was added to the existing product line. This fired a still larger cartridge (20x110RB) to achieve a muzzle velocity of 830&nbsp;m/s (versus 490&nbsp;m/s for the original Becker 20x70RB gun), at the cost of increased weight and a reduced rate of fire (280 rpm). The purpose of this development was to improve the performance of the gun as an anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapon, which required a higher muzzle velocity. An improved version known as the 1S followed in 1930.\n\nThree sizes of gun with their different ammunition and barrel length, but very similar mechanisms, continued to be developed in parallel. In 1930 Oerlikon reconsidered the application of its gun in aircraft and introduced the ''AF'' and ''AL'', designed to be used in [[flexible mount]]s, i.e. manually aimed by a gunner. The 15-round box magazine used by earlier versions of the gun was replaced by drum magazine holding 15 or 30 rounds.\n\nIn 1935 it made an important step by introducing a series of guns designed to be mounted in or on the wings of fighter aircraft. Designated with FF for ''Fl\u00fcgelfest'' meaning \"wing-mounted\", these weapons were again available in the three sizes, with designations ''FF'', ''FFL'' and ''FFS''. The FF fired a slightly larger cartridge than the AF, 20x72RB, but the major improvement in these weapons was a significant increase in rate of fire. The FF weighed 24&nbsp;kg and achieved a muzzle velocity of 550 to 600&nbsp;m/s with a rate of fire of 520 rpm. The FFL of 30&nbsp;kg fired a projectile at a muzzle velocity of 675&nbsp;m/s with a rate of fire of 500 rpm. And the FFS, which weighed 39&nbsp;kg, delivered a high muzzle velocity of 830&nbsp;m/s at a rate of fire of 470 rpm.{{sfnp|Williams|2000}}\n\nApart from changes to the design of the guns for wing-mounting and remote control, larger drums were introduced as it would not be possible to exchange magazines in flight. For the FF series drum sizes of 45, 60, 75 and 100 rounds were available, but most users chose the 60-round drum.\n\nThe 1930s were a period of global re-armament, and a number of foreign firms took licenses for the Oerlikon family of aircraft cannon. In France, [[Hispano-Suiza]] manufactured development of the FFS as the Hispano-Suiza HS.7 and\nHispano-Suiza HS.9, for installation between the cylinder banks of its [[V-12 engine]]s. In Germany, [[Ikaria]] further developed the FF gun as the [[MG FF]], firing 20x80RB ammunition. And the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], after evaluating all three guns, ordered developments of the FF and FFL as the [[Type 99 cannon|Type 99-1]] and [[Type 99 cannon|Type 99-2]].\n\nThe incorporation of the improvements of the FFS in a new anti-aircraft gun produced, in 1938, the ''Oerlikon SS''. Oerlikon realized further improvements in rate of fire on the 1SS of 1942, and the 2SS of 1945 which achieved 650 rpm. However, it was the original SS gun which was widely adopted as anti-aircraft gun, being especially widely used by\n[[Allies of World War II|Allied]] navies during [[World War II]].\n\nThis gun used a 400-grain (26-gram) charge of [[Improved Military Rifle (IMR)|IMR 4831]] [[smokeless powder]] to propel a 2,000-grain (130-gram) projectile at 2,800 feet (850 meters) per second.{{sfnp|Johnson|1944|loc=Appendix}}\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:HMS Dido gun.jpg|thumb|A [[Royal Navy]] Oerlikon gunner at his gun mount aboard the {{sclass-|Dido|cruiser}} {{HMS|Dido|37|6}} in 1942]]\n\nThe Oerlikon FF was installed as armament on some fighters of the 1930s, such as the Polish [[PZL P.24]]G. Locally produced derivatives of the Oerlikon cannon were used much more extensively, on aircraft, on ships and on land. In the air, the Ikaria [[MG FF]] was used as armament on a number of German aircraft, of which the most famous is the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]. The Japanese Navy similarly used their copy of the FF, designated the [[Type 99 cannon|Type 99 Mark One cannon]] on a number of types including the [[Mitsubishi]] [[A6M Zero]].  Later in the war, they also equipped fighters including the Zero with the [[Type 99 cannon#Type 99 Mark 2|Type 99 Mark Two]], a version of the more powerful and faster-firing Oerlikon FFL.\n\nThe French firm of Hispano-Suiza was a manufacturer of aircraft engines, and it marketed the ''moteur-canon'' combination of its [[Hispano-Suiza 12X|12X]] and [[Hispano-Suiza 12Y|12Y]] engines with a [[Hispano-Suiza H.S.7|H.S.7]] or [[Hispano-Suiza HS.9|H.S.9]] cannon installed between the cylinder banks. The gun fired through the hollow propeller hub, this being elevated above the crankcase by the design of the gearing. Such armament was installed on the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] and some other types. Similar German installations of the MG FF were not successful.\n\n[[File:British 20 mm Oerlikon shell diagrams.jpg|thumb|left|Diagrams showing basic design and colour-coding of British HE/Incendiary, Tracer and HE/Incendiary/Tracer shells for the 20 mm Oerlikon gun]]\n\nThe Oerlikon became best known in its naval applications. Initially the Oerlikon was not looked upon favorably by the [[Royal Navy]] as a short-range [[anti-aircraft]] gun. All through 1937-1938 Lord [[Louis Mountbatten]], then a [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] in the Royal Navy, waged a lone campaign within the Royal Navy to set up an unprejudiced trial for the Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm gun, but it was all in vain. It was not until the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Home Fleet]], [[Admiral]] [[Sir Roger Backhouse]], was appointed [[First Sea Lord]] that Mountbatten's efforts bore fruit. During the first half of 1939 a contract for 1,500 guns was placed in Switzerland. However, due to delays and then later the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in June 1940, only 109 guns reached the United Kingdom. All Oerlikon guns imported from Switzerland, in 1940, were mounted on various gun carriages to serve as light AA-guns on land.\n\nJust a few weeks before the Fall of France, the Oerlikon factory approved manufacture of their gun in the United Kingdom, under licence. The Royal Navy managed to smuggle out the necessary drawings and documents from [[Z\u00fcrich]]. The production of the first British-made Oerlikon guns started in [[Ruislip]], [[London]], at the end of 1940. The first guns were delivered to the Royal Navy in March or April, 1941.  The [[RAF Regiment]] made extensive use of Oerlikon guns in the anti-aircraft role.  These were the principal armament for its Light Anti-Aircraft squadrons in North Africa, the Middle East, Italy, and North Western Europe, until the introduction of the [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors]] 40/L60 40mm gun from 1943, although many squadrons retained a mix of guns until the end of World War 2. Squadrons in the Far East were equipped exclusively with Oerlikons.\n\n[[File:CV-12 20mm 1945.jpg|thumb|1945, a row of 20 mm Oerlikon guns aboard the {{sclass-|Essex|aircraft carrier}} {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}]]\n\nThe Oerlikon gun was installed aboard [[United States Navy]] ships from 1942, replacing the [[M2 Browning machine gun]], which lacked range and firepower, and largely superseding the [[1.1\"/75 caliber gun]], which was heavier and had less mechanical reliability.  It became famous in the naval anti-aircraft role, providing an effective defense at short ranges (in practice up to 1.5&nbsp;km) at which heavier guns had difficulty tracking a target. The gun was eventually abandoned as a major anti-air weapon due to its lack of [[stopping power]] against heavy aircraft and against Japanese ''[[kamikaze]]'' attacks during the [[Pacific War]]. It was largely superseded by the [[Bofors 40 mm]] gun and the [[3\"/50 caliber gun|3\"/50 Mark 22 gun]]. It provided a useful increase in firepower over the .50 cal machine gun when adapted and fitted to some aircraft. However, it had some problems with jamming in the ammunition feed.\n\nThe [[Royal Canadian Navy]] popularized the use of the Oerlikon gun as an anti-ship and anti-submarine gun - while it was not effective against the armour of most larger ships, it was used extensively and effectively against [[U-Boats]], and on the decks of larger ships. A handful of [[corvette]]s were fitted with the weapon toward the end of the war, but it appeared more commonly on [[frigate]]s and [[destroyer]]s at the time.\n\nThe Oerlikon was also used as the basis for the [[Polsten]] gun, designed by Polish engineers in exile in the United Kingdom. The gun went into service in 1944, and was used well into the 1950s, among other uses, on [[Cromwell tank]]s{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} and early model [[Centurion tank]]s.\n\nRomania purchased 45 pieces from Germany during the first half of World War II.<ref>{{cite book |last=Axworthy |first=Mark |date=1995 |title=Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945 |location=London, UK |publisher=[[Arms and Armour Press]] |page=30 |isbn=978-1-85409-267-0}}</ref>\n\n===Post-war===\n{{Expand section|date=October 2011}}\nIt is still in use today on some naval units, theoretically as a last-recourse anti-air weapon, but mainly used for firing [[warning shot]]s or incapacitating small vessels.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Oerlikon20 mm cannon on the SS Jeremiah O'Brien.jpg|thumb|left|The aiming sight of the Oerlikon gun]]\n\nVery unusually for a high-powered autocannon, the Oerlikon and its derivatives feature [[Blowback (firearms)|blowback]] operation: the bolt is not locked to the breech of the gun at the moment of firing. Non-locking, simple blowback designs are commonplace in much lighter weapons, such as small-caliber semi-automatic pistols. No locking is required, as with such low-power cartridges the static inertia of the bolt or bolt and slide - the physical tendency of heavy components to resist rapid acceleration - is adequate to ensure that the projectile has left the muzzle and the gas pressure in the barrel is down to a safe level before the breech opens (while the bolt spring also resists the opening of the breech, in practical terms its contribution is too small to be relevant).<ref>\"The Machine Gun\", Volume4, George M.Chinn., page 12</ref> In contrast, 20mm cartridges are far too powerful, and efficient autocannon barrels too long, for this basic system to be practical; so the Oerlikon uses [[Advanced Primer Ignition]] (API) to augment the resistance of the bolt. In API blowback weapons, the firing pin fires the cartridge while the bolt is still traveling forward so that the gas pressure has to overcome the forward momentum of the bolt as well, before it can push it to the rear. To facilitate this, the Oerlikon's chamber is longer than needed to contain the cartridge, and the end of the bolt, which is the same diameter as the case, actually enters this extended chamber behind the cartridge before firing.  As a result, when firing occurs, the forward force of the bolt and spring acts against the force of the propellant gases until the latter overcome the former and start pushing case, bolt and spring backwards. If the bolt had stopped at the mouth of the chamber as in a simple blowback gun, this momentum would be neutralized and the additional forward oppositional force would not exist. A second advantage of this unusual arrangement is that after firing, the bolt and case have a short, but significant, distance to travel rearwards before the bolt-end re-emerges and the case in turn begins to leave the chamber\u2014providing more time for gas pressure to drop to the necessary safe level. This system permits blowback to be used in far more powerful weapons than normal.  Nevertheless, compared to guns with a locking mechanism a fairly heavy bolt must be employed; while to give this heavy bolt sufficient forward speed, a large spring is required (and  Oerlikons, distinctively, have this component wrapped around their barrels.) These features will limit the rate of fire of such guns, unless other steps are taken\u2014as in the final model of the [[Type 99 cannon|Japanese 99 Mark 2]].{{sfnp|Williams|2000}}\n\nThis unique chamber and bolt design necessitates the use of a characteristically shaped cartridge: the case has straight sides, very little neck, and a [[rebated rim]]. The straight sides allows the case to slide back and forward in the cylindrical chamber. The neck is not supported while this happens and therefore expands when the case is fired, and the rebated rim allows the face of the bolt, with its extractor claw hooked over the rim, to fit within the chamber. To ease the motion of the case, the ammunition needed to be greased, which was a drawback of the Oerlikon cannon. An alternative developed during World War II was the so-called fluted chamber, which had grooves that allowed propellant gas to seep between the chamber wall and the case, taking over the role of the grease.{{sfnp|Williams|2000}}\n\n{{multiple image\n|align= right\n|width= 150\n|footer = <center>A twin Oerlikon gun mount from the [[Tribal-class destroyer (1936)|Tribal-class destroyer]] {{HMCS|Haida|G63|6}}</center>\n|image1= HMCS Haida Hamilton Ontario 13.jpg\n|width1=\n|caption1= Side view of the twin Oerlikon gun mount\n|image2= HMCS Haida Hamilton Ontario 14.jpg\n|width2=\n|caption2= Rear view of the twin Oerlikon gun mount\n}}\n\nAmmunition feed is typically by a 60-round drum [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] on the top of the gun. During sustained firing, the magazine must be frequently changed, reducing the effective rate of fire. Belt-fed versions of the gun were developed to overcome this limitation. A trigger in the right-hand grip controls fire. Used cartridges are ejected from below the breech.\n\nDifferent nations and services operated a number of mounting types for the same basic gun. In a typical single-barrel naval version, it is free-swinging on a fixed [[pedestal]] mounting with a flat [[vehicle armour|armored]] shield affording some protection for the crew. The cannon is aimed and fired by a gunner using, in its simplest form, a ring-and-bead [[gunsight|sight]]. The gunner is attached to the weapon by a waist-belt and shoulder supports. For this reason, some mountings existed with a height-adjustment feature to compensate for different sized gunners. A \"piece chief\" designates targets and the feeder changes exhausted magazines.\n\nDuring World War II, twin and quadruple Oerlikon mounts were developed, both for army and for navy use. The British Navy operated a hydraulically operated twin-gun mount. The US Navy operated a quad mount developed for [[PT boat]]s by Elco Naval Division, Electric Boat Company, called the Elco \"Thunderbolt\" Mount. Prototypes were built and tested in late 1942 and operationally deployed on several Elco PT Boats in the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"Elco Memo\">Elco Naval Division Memo.

This used a 20\u00d770mmRB cartridge and had a cyclic rate of fire of 300 rpm. It was used on a limited scale as an aircraft gun on ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]]'' warplanes, and an [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] gun towards the end of that war.\n\nBecause the [[Treaty of Versailles]] banned further production of such weapons in Germany, the patents and design works were transferred in 1919 to the Swiss firm SEMAG (''Seebach Maschinenbau Aktien Gesellschaft'') based near [[Z\u00fcrich]]. SEMAG continued development of the weapon, and in 1924 had produced the ''SEMAG L'', a heavier weapon (43&nbsp;kg) that fired more powerful 20\u00d7100mmRB ammunition at a slightly higher rate of fire, 350 rpm.\n\nIn 1924 SEMAG failed. The Oerlikon firm, named after the [[Oerlikon (Z\u00fcrich)|Z\u00fcrich suburb of Oerlikon]] where it was based, then acquired all rights to the weapon, plus the manufacturing equipment and the employees of SEMAG.\n\n===Oerlikon===\nIn 1927 the ''Oerlikon S'' was added to the existing product line. This fired a still larger cartridge (20x110RB) to achieve a muzzle velocity of 830&nbsp;m/s (versus 490&nbsp;m/s for the original Becker 20x70RB gun), at the cost of increased weight and a reduced rate of fire (280 rpm). The purpose of this development was to improve the performance of the gun as an anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapon, which required a higher muzzle velocity. An improved version known as the 1S followed in 1930.\n\nThree sizes of gun with their different ammunition and barrel length, but very similar mechanisms, continued to be developed in parallel. In 1930 Oerlikon reconsidered the application of its gun in aircraft and introduced the ''AF'' and ''AL'', designed to be used in [[flexible mount]]s, i.e. manually aimed by a gunner. The 15-round box magazine used by earlier versions of the gun was replaced by drum magazine holding 15 or 30 rounds.\n\nIn 1935 it made an important step by introducing a series of guns designed to be mounted in or on the wings of fighter aircraft. Designated with FF for ''Fl\u00fcgelfest'' meaning \"wing-mounted\", these weapons were again available in the three sizes, with designations ''FF'', ''FFL'' and ''FFS''. The FF fired a slightly larger cartridge than the AF, 20x72RB, but the major improvement in these weapons was a significant increase in rate of fire. The FF weighed 24&nbsp;kg and achieved a muzzle velocity of 550 to 600&nbsp;m/s with a rate of fire of 520 rpm. The FFL of 30&nbsp;kg fired a projectile at a muzzle velocity of 675&nbsp;m/s with a rate of fire of 500 rpm. And the FFS, which weighed 39&nbsp;kg, delivered a high muzzle velocity of 830&nbsp;m/s at a rate of fire of 470 rpm.{{sfnp|Williams|2000}}\n\nApart from changes to the design of the guns for wing-mounting and remote control, larger drums were introduced as it would not be possible to exchange magazines in flight. For the FF series drum sizes of 45, 60, 75 and 100 rounds were available, but most users chose the 60-round drum.\n\nThe 1930s were a period of global re-armament, and a number of foreign firms took licenses for the Oerlikon family of aircraft cannon. In France, [[Hispano-Suiza]] manufactured development of the FFS as the Hispano-Suiza HS.7 and\nHispano-Suiza HS.9, for installation between the cylinder banks of its [[V-12 engine]]s. In Germany, [[Ikaria]] further developed the FF gun as the [[MG FF]], firing 20x80RB ammunition. And the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], after evaluating all three guns, ordered developments of the FF and FFL as the [[Type 99 cannon|Type 99-1]] and [[Type 99 cannon|Type 99-2]].\n\nThe incorporation of the improvements of the FFS in a new anti-aircraft gun produced, in 1938, the ''Oerlikon SS''. Oerlikon realized further improvements in rate of fire on the 1SS of 1942, and the 2SS of 1945 which achieved 650 rpm. However, it was the original SS gun which was widely adopted as anti-aircraft gun, being especially widely used by\n[[Allies of World War II|Allied]] navies during [[World War II]].\n\nThis gun used a 400-grain (26-gram) charge of [[Improved Military Rifle (IMR)|IMR 4831]] [[smokeless powder]] to propel a 2,000-grain (130-gram) projectile at 2,800 feet (850 meters) per second.{{sfnp|Johnson|1944|loc=Appendix}}\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:HMS Dido gun.jpg|thumb|A [[Royal Navy]] Oerlikon gunner at his gun mount aboard the {{sclass-|Dido|cruiser}} {{HMS|Dido|37|6}} in 1942]]\n\nThe Oerlikon FF was installed as armament on some fighters of the 1930s, such as the Polish [[PZL P.24]]G. Locally produced derivatives of the Oerlikon cannon were used much more extensively, on aircraft, on ships and on land. In the air, the Ikaria [[MG FF]] was used as armament on a number of German aircraft, of which the most famous is the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]. The Japanese Navy similarly used their copy of the FF, designated the [[Type 99 cannon|Type 99 Mark One cannon]] on a number of types including the [[Mitsubishi]] [[A6M Zero]].  Later in the war, they also equipped fighters including the Zero with the [[Type 99 cannon#Type 99 Mark 2|Type 99 Mark Two]], a version of the more powerful and faster-firing Oerlikon FFL.\n\nThe French firm of Hispano-Suiza was a manufacturer of aircraft engines, and it marketed the ''moteur-canon'' combination of its [[Hispano-Suiza 12X|12X]] and [[Hispano-Suiza 12Y|12Y]] engines with a [[Hispano-Suiza H.S.7|H.S.7]] or [[Hispano-Suiza HS.9|H.S.9]] cannon installed between the cylinder banks. The gun fired through the hollow propeller hub, this being elevated above the crankcase by the design of the gearing. Such armament was installed on the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] and some other types. Similar German installations of the MG FF were not successful.\n\n[[File:British 20 mm Oerlikon shell diagrams.jpg|thumb|left|Diagrams showing basic design and colour-coding of British HE/Incendiary, Tracer and HE/Incendiary/Tracer shells for the 20 mm Oerlikon gun]]\n\nThe Oerlikon became best known in its naval applications. Initially the Oerlikon was not looked upon favorably by the [[Royal Navy]] as a short-range [[anti-aircraft]] gun. All through 1937-1938 Lord [[Louis Mountbatten]], then a [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] in the Royal Navy, waged a lone campaign within the Royal Navy to set up an unprejudiced trial for the Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm gun, but it was all in vain. It was not until the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Home Fleet]], [[Admiral]] [[Sir Roger Backhouse]], was appointed [[First Sea Lord]] that Mountbatten's efforts bore fruit. During the first half of 1939 a contract for 1,500 guns was placed in Switzerland. However, due to delays and then later the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in June 1940, only 109 guns reached the United Kingdom. All Oerlikon guns imported from Switzerland, in 1940, were mounted on various gun carriages to serve as light AA-guns on land.\n\nJust a few weeks before the Fall of France, the Oerlikon factory approved manufacture of their gun in the United Kingdom, under licence. The Royal Navy managed to smuggle out the necessary drawings and documents from [[Z\u00fcrich]]. The production of the first British-made Oerlikon guns started in [[Ruislip]], [[London]], at the end of 1940. The first guns were delivered to the Royal Navy in March or April, 1941.  The [[RAF Regiment]] made extensive use of Oerlikon guns in the anti-aircraft role.  These were the principal armament for its Light Anti-Aircraft squadrons in North Africa, the Middle East, Italy, and North Western Europe, until the introduction of the [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors]] 40/L60 40mm gun from 1943, although many squadrons retained a mix of guns until the end of World War 2. Squadrons in the Far East were equipped exclusively with Oerlikons.\n\n[[File:CV-12 20mm 1945.jpg|thumb|1945, a row of 20 mm Oerlikon guns aboard the {{sclass-|Essex|aircraft carrier}} {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}]]\n\nThe Oerlikon gun was installed aboard [[United States Navy]] ships from 1942, replacing the [[M2 Browning machine gun]], which lacked range and firepower, and largely superseding the [[1.1\"/75 caliber gun]], which was heavier and had less mechanical reliability.  It became famous in the naval anti-aircraft role, providing an effective defense at short ranges (in practice up to 1.5&nbsp;km) at which heavier guns had difficulty tracking a target. The gun was eventually abandoned as a major anti-air weapon due to its lack of [[stopping power]] against heavy aircraft and against Japanese ''[[kamikaze]]'' attacks during the [[Pacific War]]. It was largely superseded by the [[Bofors 40 mm]] gun and the [[3\"/50 caliber gun|3\"/50 Mark 22 gun]]. It provided a useful increase in firepower over the .50 cal machine gun when adapted and fitted to some aircraft. However, it had some problems with jamming in the ammunition feed.\n\nThe [[Royal Canadian Navy]] popularized the use of the Oerlikon gun as an anti-ship and anti-submarine gun - while it was not effective against the armour of most larger ships, it was used extensively and effectively against [[U-Boats]], and on the decks of larger ships. A handful of [[corvette]]s were fitted with the weapon toward the end of the war, but it appeared more commonly on [[frigate]]s and [[destroyer]]s at the time.\n\nThe Oerlikon was also used as the basis for the [[Polsten]] gun, designed by Polish engineers in exile in the United Kingdom. The gun went into service in 1944, and was used well into the 1950s, among other uses, on [[Cromwell tank]]s{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} and early model [[Centurion tank]]s.\n\nRomania purchased 45 pieces from Germany during the first half of World War II.<ref>{{cite book |last=Axworthy |first=Mark |date=1995 |title=Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945 |location=London, UK |publisher=[[Arms and Armour Press]] |page=30 |isbn=978-1-85409-267-0}}</ref>\n\n===Post-war===\n{{Expand section|date=October 2011}}\nIt is still in use today on some naval units, theoretically as a last-recourse anti-air weapon, but mainly used for firing [[warning shot]]s or incapacitating small vessels.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Oerlikon20 mm cannon on the SS Jeremiah O'Brien.jpg|thumb|left|The aiming sight of the Oerlikon gun]]\n\nVery unusually for a high-powered autocannon, the Oerlikon and its derivatives feature [[Blowback (firearms)|blowback]] operation: the bolt is not locked to the breech of the gun at the moment of firing. Non-locking, simple blowback designs are commonplace in much lighter weapons, such as small-caliber semi-automatic pistols. No locking is required, as with such low-power cartridges the static inertia of the bolt or bolt and slide - the physical tendency of heavy components to resist rapid acceleration - is adequate to ensure that the projectile has left the muzzle and the gas pressure in the barrel is down to a safe level before the breech opens (while the bolt spring also resists the opening of the breech, in practical terms its contribution is too small to be relevant).<ref>\"The Machine Gun\", Volume4, George M.Chinn., page 12</ref> In contrast, 20mm cartridges are far too powerful, and efficient autocannon barrels too long, for this basic system to be practical; so the Oerlikon uses [[Advanced Primer Ignition]] (API) to augment the resistance of the bolt. In API blowback weapons, the firing pin fires the cartridge while the bolt is still traveling forward so that the gas pressure has to overcome the forward momentum of the bolt as well, before it can push it to the rear. To facilitate this, the Oerlikon's chamber is longer than needed to contain the cartridge, and the end of the bolt, which is the same diameter as the case, actually enters this extended chamber behind the cartridge before firing.  As a result, when firing occurs, the forward force of the bolt and spring acts against the force of the propellant gases until the latter overcome the former and start pushing case, bolt and spring backwards. If the bolt had stopped at the mouth of the chamber as in a simple blowback gun, this momentum would be neutralized and the additional forward oppositional force would not exist. A second advantage of this unusual arrangement is that after firing, the bolt and case have a short, but significant, distance to travel rearwards before the bolt-end re-emerges and the case in turn begins to leave the chamber\u2014providing more time for gas pressure to drop to the necessary safe level. This system permits blowback to be used in far more powerful weapons than normal.  Nevertheless, compared to guns with a locking mechanism a fairly heavy bolt must be employed; while to give this heavy bolt sufficient forward speed, a large spring is required (and  Oerlikons, distinctively, have this component wrapped around their barrels.) These features will limit the rate of fire of such guns, unless other steps are taken\u2014as in the final model of the [[Type 99 cannon|Japanese 99 Mark 2]].{{sfnp|Williams|2000}}\n\nThis unique chamber and bolt design necessitates the use of a characteristically shaped cartridge: the case has straight sides, very little neck, and a [[rebated rim]]. The straight sides allows the case to slide back and forward in the cylindrical chamber. The neck is not supported while this happens and therefore expands when the case is fired, and the rebated rim allows the face of the bolt, with its extractor claw hooked over the rim, to fit within the chamber. To ease the motion of the case, the ammunition needed to be greased, which was a drawback of the Oerlikon cannon. An alternative developed during World War II was the so-called fluted chamber, which had grooves that allowed propellant gas to seep between the chamber wall and the case, taking over the role of the grease.{{sfnp|Williams|2000}}\n\n{{multiple image\n|align= right\n|width= 150\n|footer = <center>A twin Oerlikon gun mount from the [[Tribal-class destroyer (1936)|Tribal-class destroyer]] {{HMCS|Haida|G63|6}}</center>\n|image1= HMCS Haida Hamilton Ontario 13.jpg\n|width1=\n|caption1= Side view of the twin Oerlikon gun mount\n|image2= HMCS Haida Hamilton Ontario 14.jpg\n|width2=\n|caption2= Rear view of the twin Oerlikon gun mount\n}}\n\nAmmunition feed is typically by a 60-round drum [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] on the top of the gun. During sustained firing, the magazine must be frequently changed, reducing the effective rate of fire. Belt-fed versions of the gun were developed to overcome this limitation. A trigger in the right-hand grip controls fire. Used cartridges are ejected from below the breech.\n\nDifferent nations and services operated a number of mounting types for the same basic gun. In a typical single-barrel naval version, it is free-swinging on a fixed [[pedestal]] mounting with a flat [[vehicle armour|armored]] shield affording some protection for the crew. The cannon is aimed and fired by a gunner using, in its simplest form, a ring-and-bead [[gunsight|sight]]. The gunner is attached to the weapon by a waist-belt and shoulder supports. For this reason, some mountings existed with a height-adjustment feature to compensate for different sized gunners. A \"piece chief\" designates targets and the feeder changes exhausted magazines.\n\nDuring World War II, twin and quadruple Oerlikon mounts were developed, both for army and for navy use. The British Navy operated a hydraulically operated twin-gun mount. The US Navy operated a quad mount developed for [[PT boat]]s by Elco Naval Division, Electric Boat Company, called the Elco \"Thunderbolt\" Mount. Prototypes were built and tested in late 1942 and operationally deployed on several Elco PT Boats in the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"Elco Memo\">Elco Naval Division Memo.

The original form consisted of two pairs of [[Retroreflector|reflective]] glass spheres set into a white rubber dome, mounted in a [[cast iron]] housing. This is the kind that marks the centre of the road, with one pair of cat's eyes showing in each direction. A single-ended form has become widely used in other colours at road margins and as lane dividers. Cat's eyes are particularly valuable in fog and are largely resistant to damage from [[Snowplow|snow ploughs]].\n\nA key feature of the cat's eye is the flexible rubber dome which is occasionally deformed by the passage of traffic. A fixed rubber wiper cleans the surface of the reflectors as they sink below the surface of the road (the base tends to hold water after a shower of rain, making this process even more efficient). The rubber dome is protected from impact damage by metal 'kerbs' \u2013 which also give tactile and audible feedback for wandering drivers.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Catseye closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Double-ended cat's eye is Shaw's original design and marks road centre-line]]\nThe inventor of cat's eyes was [[Percy Shaw]] of [[Boothtown]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire]], England.

Some road users, especially cyclists and motorcyclists, consider cat's eyes unnecessary as an additional lane or position marking identification and actually pose a threat to safety upon impact due to their prominent, slippery and unforgiving nature \u2013 particularly in the wet \u2013 and of their propensity to be located in close proximity to areas of increased hazard. It is also suggested that the additional emphasis of an already brightly visible and reflective painted lane marking is simply not required for any potential road event or condition. Many also consider that the absence of cat's eyes reduces the risk of physical and audible discomfort when driving, and that their benefits to safety are exaggerated.\n\n===Lebanon===\n\nIn Lebanon, cat's eyes are widely used on most freeways, highways and roadways.

The original form consisted of two pairs of [[Retroreflector|reflective]] glass spheres set into a white rubber dome, mounted in a [[cast iron]] housing. This is the kind that marks the centre of the road, with one pair of cat's eyes showing in each direction. A single-ended form has become widely used in other colours at road margins and as lane dividers. Cat's eyes are particularly valuable in fog and are largely resistant to damage from [[Snowplow|snow ploughs]].\n\nA key feature of the cat's eye is the flexible rubber dome which is occasionally deformed by the passage of traffic. A fixed rubber wiper cleans the surface of the reflectors as they sink below the surface of the road (the base tends to hold water after a shower of rain, making this process even more efficient). The rubber dome is protected from impact damage by metal 'kerbs' \u2013 which also give tactile and audible feedback for wandering drivers.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Catseye closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Double-ended cat's eye is Shaw's original design and marks road centre-line]]\nThe inventor of cat's eyes was [[Percy Shaw]] of [[Boothtown]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire]], England.

These are often used in conjunction with two rows of the temporary cat's eyes to divide traffic moving in opposite directions during motorway roadworks.\n\nSolar-powered cat's eyes known as solar road studs and showing a red or amber [[LED]] to traffic, have been introduced on roads regarded as particularly dangerous at locations throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astucia.co.uk/case-studies?pageIndex=0|title=Case studies|publisher=Astucia Traffic Safety Systems|accessdate=13 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title =Cats eyes to improve safety on A65, North Yorkshire| publisher =Government News Network| date =6 November 2006| url =http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=239967&NewsAreaID=2| accessdate =15 March 2008| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165256/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=239967&NewsAreaID=2| archivedate =30 September 2007}}</ref> However, shortly after one such installation in [[Essex]] in the autumn of 2006 the [[BBC]] reported that the devices, which flash at an almost imperceptibly fast rate of 100 times a second, could possibly set off [[epileptic fit]]s and the [[Highways Agency]] had suspended the programme.<ref>{{cite news  | title = New cat's eye 'could trigger fit'  | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2 January 2007  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/6226285.stm  | accessdate =15 March 2008 }}</ref> The suspension appeared to have been lifted by 2015, when LED cat's eyes began to be installed along newly re-paved sections of the A1 and A1(M) in [[County Durham]] and [[Tyne and Wear]].  \n\nFlashing blue LED cat's eyes were demonstrated on the TV show ''Accident Black Spot'', aired on [[Channel 4]] on 19 December 2000, which alert the driver to potential ice on the road when a low enough temperature, provisionally set at {{convert|3|C}}, is reached.
