Leonard and Amy have fun recreating experiments from when they were growing up, boring Penny, so she eats with Sheldon as he mulls over his scientific studies. Penny helps him realize that his study of dark matter is his rebound science from string theory, which Sheldon admits he never truly disregarded, but explaining string theory to her inspires Sheldon, helping him discover a potential breakthrough in the field.

Its first editors were D. Meldola and M. Angel. It was issued as a weekly until May 1842, when it was suspended. From October 1844, it resumed as a fortnightly, with Joseph Mitchell as its editor. In 1847, it became again a weekly newspaper. A. Benisch, who became the proprietor and editor in 1855, bequeathed the paper to the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] in 1878, who sold it to its new editor and anti-Zionist Asher I. Myers, Sydney M. Samuel and Israel David.<ref name=\"encycl\">[https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/jewish-chronicle ''Jewish Chronicle''] . Encyclopedia.com, accessed October 2018</ref>\n\nIn 1881, the leaders of the Jewish community in London were  being criticised for not campaigning against the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogroms that were taking place in the Russian Empire]]. Under the leadership of [[Francis Goldsmid|Francis Henry Goldsmid]], the pogroms were not mentioned by the newspaper and it was only after the feminist [[Louisa Goldsmid]] gave her support following calls to arms by an anonymous writer named \"Juriscontalus\" and Asher Myers of ''The Jewish Chronicle'' that action was taken. Public meetings were then held across the country and Jewish and Christian leaders in Britain spoke out against the atrocities.<ref name=\"Monaco2013\">{{cite book|author=C. S.

J. Greenberg|L.J. Greenberg]], a successful advertising agent and English Zionist leader, contacted the Dutch banker Jacobus Kann with the object of buying ''The Jewish Chronicle'' to promote Zionism.<ref>[https://www.thejc.com/news/news-features/how-the-jc-helped-shape-the-debate-1.448157 ''How the JC helped shape the debate'']. David Cesarani, The Jewish Chronicle, 16 November 2017</ref> The same month, Greenberg, together with David Wolffsohn, Joseph Cowen, Jacobus H. Kahn, and Leopold Kessler, bought the shares. Greenberg himself became its editor.<ref name=\"encycl\" />\n\nAt the time, ''The JC'' gained a near monopoly in the Jewish press, taking over its principal competitors, ''The Hebrew Observer'' and ''The Jewish World''. Only in October 1919, did ''The JC'' get a strong opposing voice from ''The Jewish Guardian'', paper of the [[League of British Jews]], which counterbalanced the Zionist views of ''The JC'', until it disappeared in 1931. After Greenberg died the same year, ''The JC'' remained moderately pro-Zionist under the leadership of [[Leopold Kessler (Zionist)|Leopold Kessler]].<ref name=\"encycl\" />\n\nThe weekly newspaper ''The Jewish World'' was taken over in 1913. It published articles by various Zionist leaders, as well as early non-Jewish pro-Zionists. In 1934, it was merged with ''The Jewish Chronicle''.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-world Jewish World]. JVL, accessed October 2018</ref> After 1948, the paper maintained a pro-Israel attitude.\n\nIn the late 1930s, [[David F. Kessler]] became managing director to assist his chairman father [[Leopold Kessler (Zionist)|Leopold Kessler]], a moderate Zionist and an associate of [[Theodor Herzl]], known as the father of the [[State of Israel]]. After service as a soldier in [[World War II]] during which his father had died, Kessler found that the editor, [[Ivan Greenberg]], had taken a right-wing Zionist position highly critical of moderate Zionists and the British policy in Palestine. Kessler, after a struggle with the newspaper's board, sacked Greenberg and installed a moderate editor.<ref name=guardian-19991201>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/01/guardianobituaries |title=David Kessler |last=Paul |first=Geoffrey |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 December 1999 |accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, the Kessler family owned 80% of the newspaper's shares. To safeguard the newspaper's future, Kessler created a foundation ownership structure loosely modelled on the [[Scott Trust Limited|Scott Trust]] owners of ''[[The Guardian]]''. Kessler was chairman for nearly 30 years until his death in 1999.<ref name=guardian-19991201/>\n\nJoseph Finklestone wrote for the paper from 1946 to 1992 in roles including sports editor, chief sub-editor, home news editor, assistant editor, foreign editor, and diplomatic editor.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/mar/15/guardianobituaries.pressandpublishing |title=Joseph Finklestone |last=Raven |first=Rebecca |date=15 March 2002 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nGeoffrey Paul (birth name Goldstein) was editor between 1977 and 1990.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/tributes-paid-to-former-jc-editor-geoffrey-paul-who-dies-aged-90/|title=Tributes paid to former JC editor Geoffrey Paul, who dies aged 90|last=Frazer|first=Jenni|date=6 August 2019|accessdate=|work=Jewish News}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nEditors have included [[Ned Temko]], 1990 to 2005, Jeff Barak (managing editor, 2006), who returned to Israel, and David Rowan, 2006 to 2008, who joined ''[[The Observer]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/21/pressandpublishing.religion|title=Jewish Chronicle appoints new editor|last=Day|first=Julia|date=21 February 2006|accessdate=23 September 2019|work=The Guardian}}</ref> In November 2008, [[Stephen Pollard]] became editor.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn 2019, after a number of years of declining circulation and a pension deficit, the reserves of its owners had been exhausted and the ''[[Press Gazette]]'' reported its situation as \"facing a grave closure threat\".

After Leopold Greenberg had taken over the paper in 1906, it became strongly Zionist and it was made into \"a firm and influential champion of Zionism\".<ref name=\"Cesarani1994\">{{cite book|author=David Cesarani|title=The Jewish Chronicle and Anglo-Jewry, 1841\u20131991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tR8ozMMF4MgC&pg=PA130|date=3 March 1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43434-8|page=130}}</ref>\n\n''The JC'' supported the 1917 [[Balfour Declaration]], the publication of which was postponed for a week in order to allow the Chronicle to publish its opinion in time. After the Declaration was issued, however, the paper became critical of [[Chaim Weizmann]]. Greenberg was discontented with the too vague definition of the Zionist goals and wanted him to state clearly that Palestine must be politically Jewish. He wanted to define the \"National Home\" as a Jewish Commonwealth.<ref>Cesarani 1994, p. 127-128</ref> Although JC's support of Zionism somewhat decreased after Greenberg's death, it has consistently devoted considerable space to Israel and Zionism.<ref name=\"encycl\" />\n\nUnder Leopold Greenberg, ''The JC'' was hostile to the Reform and Liberal movements in Britain. Over the years, attention shifted from Orthodoxy in Anglo-Jewry to developments in Progressive Judaism, while becoming more critical of the Orthodox position on [[halakhic]] issues.<ref name=\"encycl\" />\n\nPollard accepts that the paper does not present a comprehensive picture of events, saying in 2009, \"But don't forget who our readership is. They are interested in getting the news about Israel. It's not a biased view. We are presenting one aspect of all the news that is going on.

The team failed to improve on their 10\u20136 record in [[2003 NFL season|2003]] and finished at 6\u201310, failing to make the postseason for the first time since [[2002 Dallas Cowboys season|2002]].<ref>https://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/dallas-cowboys/results</ref>\n\n==Offseason==\nBefore the season began, the Cowboys faced were forced to adjust. Coming off their first winning season [[1998 Dallas Cowboys season|for the first time in five years]], the team, under Bill Parcells' direction, continued to bring in veteran talent and draft promising prospects. \nIn the offseason, the Cowboys signed [[quarterback]] [[Vinny Testaverde]] and traded for [[wide receiver]] [[Keyshawn Johnson]].   Both Testaverde and Johnson had played for Parcells when he had coached the [[New York Jets]].  In return for Johnson, the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Buccaneers]] received [[Joey Galloway]]. The draft saw the arrival of [[running back]] [[Julius Jones]], [[cornerback]]s [[Jacques Reeves]] and [[Nate Jones (American football)|Nate Jones]], and college quarterback turned wide receiver [[Patrick Crayton]]. In owner [[Jerry Jones]]'s continuing quest to acquire quarterback talent, the Cowboys traded for the rights to [[Drew Henson]], another baseball player attempting to return to football. Henson starred at [[Michigan Wolverines|Michigan]], keeping future NFL quarterback [[Tom Brady]] from claiming the starting job outright. His struggles in the [[New York Yankees]] farm system led him to reconsider his career and opt for a return to football, similar to [[Chad Hutchinson]], whom the team had acquired two years prior. Hutchinson was later released.<ref>https://thelandryhat.com/2014/01/30/grading-dallas-cowboys-past-drafts-2004/</ref>\n\n==Quarterback controversy==\n\nWith the opening of training camp, the team seemed poised to take the next step; however, this soon changed. Within the first week of camp, the [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] released starting [[quarterback]] [[Quincy Carter]]. The move came with no warning; reporters at training camp became aware something had occurred when Carter did not suit up for practice and was later seen being escorted from the Cowboys facility. Though never verified by Carter or the team, it has been speculated by the Cowboys,  that his release was prompted by a failed drug test administered by the Cowboys, an action prohibited by NFL rules. Rumors began that Carter had already entered the second phase of the NFL's substance abuse program, meaning he had twice failed NFL-mandated random drug screenings. \n\nTest results are not made public but notices are sent to team officials. A third violation of the substance abuse program results in a mandatory suspension, and the Cowboys, unwilling to risk losing a starting quarterback during the season, began to monitor Carter with its own drug tests. Carter's formal protest of his release through the [[NFLPA]] as well as his subsequent troubles with drug addiction appear to lend credence to this scenario, According to the NFLPA. This move had a long-term effect on the team: Had Carter remained, second-year QB Tony Romo would have been fourth on the depth chart and likely cut from the team. When Carter left, Romo moved up to number 3, and was later a Pro Bowl starting quarterback for the Cowboys.<ref>https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1586465-the-10-biggest-draft-mistakes-in-dallas-cowboys-history</ref>\n\n==Regular season==\n\nAs a result, [[Vinny Testaverde]] would be the opening day starter for the [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]]<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/05/sports/pro-football-cowboys-release-carter-and-testaverde-steps-in.html</ref>. His extensive experience and veteran presence was an asset to the team, especially to young undrafted practice squad addition [[Tony Romo]], but failed to produce many points behind an inconsistent offensive line. Dallas' defense would also regress from the previous season, especially the secondary which lost starting [[cornerback]] [[Mario Edwards]] in free agency and longtime mainstay and team leader [[safety (football position)|safety]] [[Darren Woodson]] to injury. The result was a defense often on the field for long stretches and an offense constantly playing from behind. Following a loss to the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in which he played well in mop-up duty, [[Drew Henson]] would start the annual Thanksgiving Day game against the [[Chicago Bears]].\n\nThe game still provided excitement for [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] fans as a rookie [[running back]] [[Julius Jones]], who had been injured early in the season and had just returned in the previous game, put on a masterful performance rushing for 150 yards and two touchdowns in leading the team to victory. [[Julius Jones|Jones]]' momentum would carry over to the next game where he would rush for 198 yards and three scores in a dramatic win over the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. In only 7 starts (8 games overall) Jones would rush for over 800 yards and seven touchdowns, though not justifying [[Bill Parcells|Parcells]]' decision to pass on [[running backs]] [[Steven Jackson]] and [[Kevin Jones (American football)|Kevin Jones]] in the draft.

League]] (NFL), their 16th under the ownership of [[Jerry Jones]], their 33rd playing their home games at [[Texas Stadium]], and their second season under [[List of Dallas Cowboys head coaches|head coach]] [[Bill Parcells]].   The team failed to improve on their 10\u20136 record in [[2003 NFL season|2003]] and finished at 6\u201310, failing to make the postseason for the first time since [[2002 Dallas Cowboys season|2002]].<ref>https://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/dallas-cowboys/results</ref>\n\n==Offseason==\nBefore the season began, the Cowboys faced were forced to adjust. Coming off their first winning season [[1998 Dallas Cowboys season|for the first time in five years]], the team, under Bill Parcells' direction, continued to bring in veteran talent and draft promising prospects. \nIn the offseason, the Cowboys signed [[quarterback]] [[Vinny Testaverde]] and traded for [[wide receiver]] [[Keyshawn Johnson]].   Both Testaverde and Johnson had played for Parcells when he had coached the [[New York Jets]].  In return for Johnson, the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Buccaneers]] received [[Joey Galloway]]. The draft saw the arrival of [[running back]] [[Julius Jones]], [[cornerback]]s [[Jacques Reeves]] and [[Nate Jones (American football)|Nate Jones]], and college quarterback turned wide receiver [[Patrick Crayton]]. In owner [[Jerry Jones]]'s continuing quest to acquire quarterback talent, the Cowboys traded for the rights to [[Drew Henson]], another baseball player attempting to return to football. Henson starred at [[Michigan Wolverines|Michigan]], keeping future NFL quarterback [[Tom Brady]] from claiming the starting job outright. His struggles in the [[New York Yankees]] farm system led him to reconsider his career and opt for a return to football, similar to [[Chad Hutchinson]], whom the team had acquired two years prior. Hutchinson was later released.<ref>https://thelandryhat.com/2014/01/30/grading-dallas-cowboys-past-drafts-2004/</ref>\n\n==Quarterback controversy==\n\nWith the opening of training camp, the team seemed poised to take the next step; however, this soon changed. Within the first week of camp, the [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] released starting [[quarterback]] [[Quincy Carter]]. The move came with no warning; reporters at training camp became aware something had occurred when Carter did not suit up for practice and was later seen being escorted from the Cowboys facility. Though never verified by Carter or the team, it has been speculated by the Cowboys,  that his release was prompted by a failed drug test administered by the Cowboys, an action prohibited by NFL rules. Rumors began that Carter had already entered the second phase of the NFL's substance abuse program, meaning he had twice failed NFL-mandated random drug screenings. \n\nTest results are not made public but notices are sent to team officials. A third violation of the substance abuse program results in a mandatory suspension, and the Cowboys, unwilling to risk losing a starting quarterback during the season, began to monitor Carter with its own drug tests. Carter's formal protest of his release through the [[NFLPA]] as well as his subsequent troubles with drug addiction appear to lend credence to this scenario, According to the NFLPA. This move had a long-term effect on the team: Had Carter remained, second-year QB Tony Romo would have been fourth on the depth chart and likely cut from the team. When Carter left, Romo moved up to number 3, and was later a Pro Bowl starting quarterback for the Cowboys.<ref>https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1586465-the-10-biggest-draft-mistakes-in-dallas-cowboys-history</ref>\n\n==Regular season==\n\nAs a result, [[Vinny Testaverde]] would be the opening day starter for the [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]]<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/05/sports/pro-football-cowboys-release-carter-and-testaverde-steps-in.html</ref>. His extensive experience and veteran presence was an asset to the team, especially to young undrafted practice squad addition [[Tony Romo]], but failed to produce many points behind an inconsistent offensive line. Dallas' defense would also regress from the previous season, especially the secondary which lost starting [[cornerback]] [[Mario Edwards]] in free agency and longtime mainstay and team leader [[safety (football position)|safety]] [[Darren Woodson]] to injury. The result was a defense often on the field for long stretches and an offense constantly playing from behind. Following a loss to the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in which he played well in mop-up duty, [[Drew Henson]] would start the annual Thanksgiving Day game against the [[Chicago Bears]].\n\nThe game still provided excitement for [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] fans as a rookie [[running back]] [[Julius Jones]], who had been injured early in the season and had just returned in the previous game, put on a masterful performance rushing for 150 yards and two touchdowns in leading the team to victory. [[Julius Jones|Jones]]' momentum would carry over to the next game where he would rush for 198 yards and three scores in a dramatic win over the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. In only 7 starts (8 games overall) Jones would rush for over 800 yards and seven touchdowns, though not justifying [[Bill Parcells|Parcells]]' decision to pass on [[running backs]] [[Steven Jackson]] and [[Kevin Jones (American football)|Kevin Jones]] in the draft. As the season progressed, [[Bill Parcells|Parcells]] would continue to mold the team steadily implementing his preferred [[3-4 defense]] and allowing his assistant coaches on offense, particularly [[Maurice Carthon]] and [[Sean Payton]], to take more control.

{"title_page": "Edo period", "text_new": "{{short description|Period of Japanese history}}\n{{History of Japan |periods |image=File:The Great Wave off Kanagawa.jpg |caption=}}\n\nThe {{nihongo|'''Edo period'''|\u6c5f\u6238\u6642\u4ee3|Edo jidai}} or {{nihongo|'''Tokugawa period'''|\u5fb3\u5ddd\u6642\u4ee3|Tokugawa jidai}} is the period between 1603 and 1868 in the [[history of Japan]], when Japan was under the rule of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and the country's 300 regional ''[[daimy\u014d]]''. The period was characterized by economic growth, strict social order, [[Isolationism|isolationist]] foreign policies, a stable population,  \"no more wars\", and popular enjoyment of arts and culture. The shogunate was officially established in [[Edo]] on March 24, 1603, by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. The period came to an end with the [[Meiji Restoration]] on May 3, 1868, after the [[fall of Edo]].\n\n== Consolidation of the shogunate ==\n{{main|Tokugawa shogunate}}\n[[File:Tokugawa Ieyasu2.JPG|thumb|[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], first ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]]]\n\nA [[revolution]] took place from the time of the [[Kamakura shogunate]], which existed with the [[Tenn\u014d]]'s court, to the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]], when the ''[[samurai]]'' became the unchallenged rulers   in what historian [[Edwin O. Reischauer]] called a \"centralized [[feudal]]\" form of shogunate. Instrumental in the rise of the new-existing [[bakufu]] was [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], the main beneficiary of the achievements of [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. Already powerful, Ieyasu profited by his transfer to the rich [[Kant\u014d region|Kant\u014d]] area. He maintained two million ''[[koku]]'' of land, a new headquarters at [[Edo]], a strategically situated castle town (the future [[Tokyo]]), and also had an additional two million ''koku'' of land and thirty-eight [[vassal]]s under his control. After Hideyoshi's death, Ieyasu moved quickly to seize control from the [[Toyotomi clan]].\n\nIeyasu's victory over the western ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] (October 21, 1600, or in the Japanese calendar on the 15th day of the ninth month of the fifth year of the [[Keich\u014d]] era) gave him control of all [[Japan]]. He rapidly abolished numerous enemy ''daimy\u014d'' houses, reduced others, such as that of the Toyotomi, and redistributed the spoils of war to his family and allies. Ieyasu still failed to achieve complete control of the western ''daimy\u014d'', but his assumption of the title of ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' helped consolidate the alliance system. After further strengthening his power base, Ieyasu installed his son [[Tokugawa Hidetada|Hidetada]] (1579\u20131632) as ''sh\u014dgun'' and himself as retired ''sh\u014dgun'' in 1605. The Toyotomi were still a significant threat, and Ieyasu devoted the next decade to their eradication. In 1615, the Tokugawa army destroyed the Toyotomi stronghold at [[Osaka]].\n\nThe Tokugawa (or Edo) period brought 250 years of stability to Japan. The political system evolved into what historians call ''bakuhan'', a combination of the terms ''bakufu'' and ''[[Han (administrative division)|han]]'' (domains) to describe the government and society of the period.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|McClain|1991|pp=128\u2013182}}</ref> In the ''bakuhan'', the ''sh\u014dgun'' had national authority and the ''daimy\u014d'' had regional authority. This represented a new unity in the feudal structure, which featured an increasingly large bureaucracy to administer the mixture of [[centralized]] and decentralized authorities. The Tokugawa became more powerful during their first century of rule: land redistribution gave them nearly seven million ''koku'', control of the most important cities, and a land assessment system reaping great revenues.\n\nThe  feudal hierarchy was completed by the various classes of ''daimy\u014d''. Closest to the Tokugawa house were the ''[[Shinpan (daimyo)|shinpan]]'', or \"related houses\". They were twenty-three ''daimy\u014d'' on the borders of Tokugawa lands, all directly related to Ieyasu. The shinpan held mostly honorary titles and advisory posts in the bakufu. The second class of the hierarchy were the ''[[fudai]]'', or \"house ''daimy\u014d''\", rewarded with lands close to the Tokugawa holdings for their faithful service. By the 18th century, 145 ''fudai'' controlled much smaller ''han'', the greatest assessed at 250,000 ''koku''. Members of the ''fudai'' class staffed most of the major bakufu offices. Ninety-seven ''han'' formed the third group, the ''[[tozama]]'' (outside vassals), former opponents or new allies. The ''tozama'' were located mostly on the peripheries of the archipelago and collectively controlled nearly ten million ''koku'' of productive land. Because the ''tozama'' were least trusted of the ''daimy\u014d'', they were the most cautiously managed and generously treated, although they were excluded from central [[government]] positions.\n\nThe Tokugawa shogunate not only consolidated their control over a reunified Japan, they also had unprecedented power over the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]], the court, all ''daimy\u014d'' and the religious orders. The emperor was held up as the ultimate source of political sanction for the ''sh\u014dgun'', who ostensibly was the vassal of the imperial family. The Tokugawa helped the imperial family recapture its old glory by rebuilding its palaces and granting it new lands. To ensure a close tie between the imperial clan and the Tokugawa family, Ieyasu's granddaughter was made an imperial consort in 1619.\n\nA code of laws was established to regulate the ''daimy\u014d'' houses. The code encompassed private conduct, marriage, dress, types of weapons and numbers of troops allowed; required feudal lords to reside in Edo every other year (the ''[[sankin-k\u014dtai]]'' system); prohibited the construction of ocean-going ships; proscribed Christianity; restricted castles to one per domain (''han'') and stipulated that bakufu regulations were the national law. Although the ''daimy\u014d'' were not taxed per se, they were regularly levied for contributions for [[military]] and logistical support and for such public works projects as castles, roads, bridges and palaces. The various regulations and levies not only strengthened the Tokugawa but also depleted the wealth of the ''daimy\u014d'', thus weakening their threat to the central administration. The ''han'', once military-centered domains, became mere local [[Administration (government)|administrative]] units. The ''daimy\u014d'' did have full administrative control over their territory and their complex systems of retainers, [[bureaucrat]]s and commoners. Loyalty was exacted from religious foundations, already greatly weakened by Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, through a variety of control mechanisms.\n\n==Foreign trade relations==\n{{main|Sakoku}}\n[[File:HasekuraWithShipDetail.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|San Juan Bautista]]'' is represented in [[Claude Deruet]]'s painting of [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] in Rome in 1617, as a galleon with Hasekura's flag (red manji on orange background) on the top mast.]]\n[[File:Hasekura Travels.jpg|thumb|Itinerary and dates of the travels of Hasekura Tsunenaga]]\n[[File:Kawahara Nagasaki.jpg|thumb|right|Bird's-eye view of the Nagasaki bay, with the island [[Dejima]] at mid-left (1820). ]]\n\nLike Hideyoshi, Ieyasu encouraged foreign trade but also was suspicious of outsiders. He wanted to make Edo a major port, but once he learned that the Europeans favored ports in [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] and that China had rejected his plans for official trade, he moved to control existing trade and allowed only certain ports to handle specific kinds of commodities.\n\nThe beginning of the Edo period coincides with the last decades of the [[Nanban trade period]] during which intense interaction with European powers, on the economic and religious plane, took place. It is at the beginning of the Edo period that Japan built its first ocean-going Western-style [[warships]], such as the [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''San Juan Bautista'']], a 500-[[ton]] [[galleon]]-type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] to the Americas and then to Europe. Also during that period, the ''bakufu'' commissioned around 720 [[Red Seal Ships]], three-masted and armed trade ships, for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as [[Yamada Nagamasa]], used those ships throughout Asia.\n\nThe \"Christian problem\" was, in effect, a problem of controlling both the Christian ''daimy\u014d'' in Ky\u016bsh\u016b and their trade with the [[Europeans]]. By 1612, the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s retainers and residents of Tokugawa lands had been ordered to forswear Christianity. More restrictions came in 1616 (the restriction of foreign trade to Nagasaki and Hirado, an island northwest of Ky\u016bsh\u016b), 1622 (the execution of 120 missionaries and converts), 1624 (the expulsion of the Spanish), and 1629 (the execution of thousands of Christians). Finally, the [[Closed Country Edict of 1635]] prohibited any Japanese from traveling outside Japan or, if someone left, from ever returning. In 1636, the Dutch were restricted to [[Dejima]], a small [[artificial island]]\u2014and thus, not true Japanese soil\u2014in Nagasaki's harbor.\n\nThe shogunate perceived Catholic Christianity to be an extremely destabilizing factor, and so decided to target it. The [[Shimabara Rebellion]] of 1637\u201338, in which discontented Catholic Christian samurai and peasants rebelled against the bakufu\u2014and Edo called in Dutch ships to bombard the rebel stronghold\u2014marked the end of the Christian movement, although some [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christians survived by going underground, the so-called [[Kakure Kirishitan]]. Soon thereafter, the Portuguese were permanently expelled, members of the Portuguese diplomatic mission were executed, all subjects were ordered to register at a Buddhist or Shinto temple, and the Dutch and Chinese were restricted, respectively, to Dejima and to a special quarter in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. Besides small trade of some outer ''daimy\u014d'' with [[Korea]] and the [[Ryukyu Islands]], to the southwest of Japan's main islands, by 1641, foreign contacts were limited by the policy of ''[[sakoku]]'' to Nagasaki.\n\nThe last Jesuit was either killed or reconverted by 1644<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|McClain|1991|pp=369\u2013370}}</ref> and by the 1660s, Christianity was almost completely eradicated, and its external political, economic, and religious influence on Japan became quite limited.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|McClain|1991|p=370}}</ref> Only China, the [[Dutch East India Company]], and for a short period, the English, enjoyed the right to visit Japan during this period, for commercial purposes only, and they were restricted to the [[Dejima]] port in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. Other Europeans who landed on Japanese shores were put to death without trial.\n\n==Society==\n{{main|Edo society}}\n[[File:Edo Hibachi.JPG|thumb|The house of the merchant ''([http://www.kcf.or.jp/fukagawa/ Fukagawa Edo Museum])'']]\n[[File:Edo social structure.svg|thumb|Social classes during the Edo period ([[Tokugawa shogunate]]).]]\nDuring the Tokugawa period, the social order, based on inherited position rather than personal merits, was rigid and highly formalized. At the top were the emperor and court nobles (''[[kuge]]''), together with the ''sh\u014dgun'' and ''daimy\u014d''. Below them the population was divided into [[Four divisions of society|four classes]] in a system known as ''mibunsei'' (\u8eab\u5206\u5236): the samurai on top (about 5% of the population) and the peasants (more than 80% of the population) on the second level. Below the peasants were the craftsmen, and even below them, on the fourth level, were the merchants.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beasley|1972|p=22}}</ref> Only the peasants lived in the rural areas. Samurai, craftsmen and merchants lived in the [[j\u014dkamachi|cities]] that were built around ''daimy\u014d'' [[Japanese castle|castles]], each restricted to their own quarter. Edo society had an elaborate social structure, in which every family knew its place and level of prestige.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=John W.|date=Autumn 1974|title=Rule by Status in Tokugawa Japan|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/133436?origin=crossref|journal=Journal of Japanese Studies|volume=1|issue=1|pages=39|doi=10.2307/133436|via=JSTOR}}</ref>\n\nAt the top were the Emperor and the court nobility, invincible in prestige but weak in power. Next came the [[sh\u014dgun]], ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' and layers of feudal lords whose rank was indicated by their closeness to the Tokugawa. They had power. The ''daimy\u014d'' comprised about 250 local lords of local \"han\" with annual outputs of 50,000 or more bushels of rice. The upper strata was much given to elaborate and expensive rituals, including elegant architecture, landscaped gardens, Noh drama, patronage of the arts, and the tea ceremony.{{sfn|Totman|2000|pp= 225\u2013230}}\n\nThen came the 400,000 warriors, called \"[[samurai]]\", in numerous grades and degrees. A few upper samurai were eligible for high office; most were foot soldiers (ashigaru). Since there was very little fighting, they became civil servants paid by the daimyo, with minor duties. The samurai were affiliated with senior lords in a well-established chain of command. The shogun had 17,000 samurai retainers; the daimyo each had hundreds. Most lived in modest homes near their lord's headquarters, and lived off of hereditary rights and stipends. Together these high status groups comprised Japan's ruling class making up about 6% of the total population.\n\nAfter a long period of inner conflict, the first goal of the newly established Tokugawa government was to pacify the country. It created a balance of power that remained (fairly) stable for the next 250 years, influenced by [[Confucianism|Confucian]] principles of [[social order]]. Most [[samurai]] lost their direct possession of the land: the ''daimy\u014d'' took over their land.  The samurai had a choice: give up their sword and become peasants, or move to the city of their feudal lord and become a paid retainer. Only a few land samurai remained in the border provinces of the north, or as direct vassals of the ''sh\u014dgun'', the 5,000 so-called ''[[hatamoto]]''. The ''daimy\u014d'' were put under tight control of the shogunate. Their families had to reside in Edo; the ''daimy\u014d'' themselves had to reside in Edo for one year and in their province (''[[Han (administrative division)|han]]'') for the next. This system was called ''[[sankin-k\u014dtai]]''.<ref>Michael Wert, ''Samurai: A Concise History'' (2019).</ref>\n\nLower orders divided into two main segments\u2014the peasants\u201480% of the population\u2014whose high prestige as producers was undercut by their burden as the chief source of taxes. They were illiterate and lived in villages controlled by appointed officials who kept the peace and collected taxes.\nThe family was the smallest legal entity, and the maintenance of family status and privileges was of great importance at all levels of society.  The individual had no separate legal rights. The 1711 ''Got\u014dke reij\u014d'' was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2003|pp=31\u201332}}</ref>\n\nOutside the four classes were the so-called ''[[Burakumin|eta]]'' and ''hinin'', those whose professions broke the taboos of Buddhism. ''Eta'' were butchers, tanners and undertakers. ''Hinin'' served as town guards, street cleaners, and executioners. Other outsiders included the beggars, entertainers, and prostitutes. The word ''eta'' literally translates to \"filthy\" and ''hinin'' to \"non-humans\", a thorough reflection of the attitude held by other classes that the ''eta'' and ''hinin'' were not even people.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 313\">{{harvnb|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|2002|p=313}}</ref> ''Hinin'' were only allowed inside a special quarter of the city. Other persecution of the hinin included disallowing them from wearing robes longer than knee-length and the wearing of hats.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 313\"/> Sometimes ''eta'' villages were not even printed on official maps. A sub-class of hinin who were born into their social class had no option of mobility to a different social class whereas the other class of hinin who had lost their previous class status could be reinstated in Japanese society.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 313\"/> In the 19th century the umbrella term ''burakumin'' was coined to name the ''eta'' and ''hinin'' because both classes were forced to live in separate village neighborhoods.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 93\">{{harvnb|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|2002|p=93}}</ref> The ''eta'', ''hinin'' and ''burakumin'' classes were officially abolished in 1871.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 313\"/> However, their cultural and societal impact, including some forms of discrimination, continues into modern times.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 93\"/>\n\n{{wide image|Edo Panorama old Tokyo color photochrom.jpg|1200px|Edo, 1865 or 1866.

Economic development during the Tokugawa period included [[urbanization]], increased shipping of commodities, a significant expansion of domestic and, initially, foreign commerce, and a diffusion of trade and [[handicraft]] industries. The construction trades flourished, along with banking facilities and merchant associations. Increasingly, [[Han (administrative division)|''han'']] authorities oversaw the rising agricultural production and the spread of rural handicrafts.<ref>Kozo Yamamura, \"Toward a reexamination of the economic history of Tokugawa Japan, 1600\u20131867.\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 33.3 (1973): 509-546.

Japan had almost [[zero population growth]] between the 1720s and 1820s, often attributed to lower birth rates in response to widespread famine, but some historians have presented different theories, such as a high rate of infanticide artificially controlling population.<ref>{{Harvnb|Flath|2000}}</ref> Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers, while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods.\n\n===Economy===\nThe Tokugawa era brought peace, and that brought prosperity to a nation of 31 million, 80% of them rice farmers.  Rice production increased steadily, but population remained stable.  Rice paddies grew from 1.6 million ch\u014d in 1600 to 3 million by 1720.<ref name=\"chobu\">One ch\u014d, or chobu, equals 2.45 acres.</ref> Improved technology helped farmers control the all-important flow of water to their paddies.

In the cities and towns, guilds of merchants and artisans met the growing demand for goods and services.{{sfn|Totman|2000|loc= chapter 11}}\n\nThe merchants benefited enormously, especially those with official patronage. The samurai, forbidden to engage in farming or business but allowed to borrow money, borrowed too much. The bakufu and daimyos raised taxes on farmers, but did not tax business, so they too fell into debt. By 1750 rising taxes incited peasant unrest and even revolt.  The nation had to deal somehow with samurai impoverishment and treasury deficits. The financial troubles of the samurai undermined their loyalties to the system, and the empty treasury threatened the whole system of government.

The eighth Tokugawa shogun, Yoshimune (in office 1716-1745) had considerable success, though much of his work had to be done again between 1787 and 1793 by the shogun's chief councilor Matsudaira Sadanobu (1759-1829).

Rich farmers appeared who switched from rice to high-profit commercial crops and engaged in local money-lending, trade, and small-scale manufacturing. Some wealthy merchants sought higher social status by using money to marry into the samurai class.\n\n====Agriculture====\n[[Rice]] was the base of the economy.  About 80% of the people were rice farmers.<ref>Susan B.

Taxes were high, about 40% of the harvest. The rice was sold at the ''[[fudasashi]]'' market in Edo. To raise money, the ''daimy\u014d'' used [[forward contract]]s to sell rice that was not even harvested yet. These contracts were similar to modern [[futures trading]].\n\nIt was during the Edo period that Japan developed an advanced [[forest management]] policy. Increased demand for timber resources for construction, shipbuilding and fuel had led to widespread deforestation, which resulted in forest fires, floods and soil erosion. In response the ''sh\u014dgun'', beginning around 1666, instituted a policy to reduce logging and increase the planting of trees. The policy mandated that only the ''sh\u014dgun'' and ''daimy\u014d'' could authorize the use of wood. By the 18th century, Japan had developed detailed scientific knowledge about [[silviculture]] and plantation [[forestry]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Diamond|2005|pp=297\u2013304}}</ref>\n\n===Financial services===\nThe merchants benefited enormously, especially those with official patronage.

The financial crisis provoked a reactionary solution near the end of the \"Tempo era\" (1830-1843) promulgated by the chief counselor Mizuno Tadakuni. He raised taxes, denounced luxuries and tried to impede the growth of business; he failed and it appeared to many that the continued existence of the entire Tokugawa system was in jeopardy.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McClain|first=James L.|url=|title=Japan, a modern history|date=2002|publisher=W.W.

The main areas that were studied included geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, art, languages, physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena, and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches, or [[wadokei]], inspired by Western techniques.\n\nThe flourishing of [[Neo-Confucianism]] was the major intellectual development of the Tokugawa period. [[Confucianism|Confucian]] studies had long been kept active in Japan by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] clerics, but during the Tokugawa period, Confucianism emerged from Buddhist religious control. This system of thought increased attention to a secular view of man and society. The ethical [[humanism]], [[rationalism]], and historical perspective of neo-Confucian doctrine appealed to the official class. By the mid-17th century, neo-Confucianism was Japan's dominant legal philosophy and contributed directly to the development of the ''[[kokugaku]]'' (national learning) school of thought.\n\nAdvanced studies and growing applications of neo-Confucianism contributed to the transition of the social and political order from feudal norms to class- and large-group-oriented practices. The rule of the people or Confucian man was gradually replaced by the [[rule of law]]. New laws were developed, and new administrative devices were instituted. A new theory of government and a new vision of society emerged as a means of justifying more comprehensive governance by the bakufu. Each person had a distinct place in society and was expected to work to fulfill his or her mission in life. The people were to be ruled with benevolence by those whose assigned duty it was to rule. Government was all-powerful but responsible and humane. Although the class system was influenced by neo-Confucianism, it was not identical to it. Whereas soldiers and clergy were at the bottom of the hierarchy in the Chinese model, in Japan, some members of these classes constituted the ruling elite.\n\nMembers of the [[samurai]] class adhered to bushi traditions with a renewed interest in Japanese history and in cultivation of the ways of Confucian scholar-administrators. Another special way of life\u2014''ch\u014dnind\u014d''\u2014also emerged. ''[[Ch\u014dnind\u014d]]'' (\"the way of the townspeople\") was a distinct culture that arose in cities such as [[Osaka]], [[Kyoto]], and Edo. It encouraged aspiration to bushido qualities\u2014diligence, honesty, honor, loyalty, and frugality\u2014while blending [[Shinto]], neo-Confucian, and Buddhist beliefs. Study of mathematics, astronomy, cartography, engineering, and medicine were also encouraged. Emphasis was placed on quality of workmanship, especially in the arts.\n\nFor the first time, urban populations had the means and leisure time to support a new mass culture. Their search for enjoyment became known as ''[[ukiyo]]'' (the floating world), an ideal world of fashion, popular entertainment, and the discovery of aesthetic qualities in objects and actions of everyday life.  This increasing interest in pursuing recreational activities helped to develop an array of new industries, many of which could be found in an area known as Yoshiwara. The region was better known for being the center of Edo's developing sense of elegance and refinement. This place of pleasure and luxury became a destination for the elite and wealthy merchants who wished to flaunt their fortune.<ref>{{Harvnb|Longstreet|Longstreet|1989|p=2}}</ref> Their economy relied primarily on the patronage of such individuals in order to sustain itself. For many of those who inhabited and worked in this region maintaining the illusion of grandeur was the only way of supporting their business.\n\n[[File:First Japanese treatise on Western anatomy.jpg|thumb|''[[Kaitai Shinsho]]'', Japan's first treatise on Western [[anatomy]], published in 1774]]\n\nYoshiwara was home to mostly women who, due to unfortunate circumstances, found themselves working in this secluded environment. Combining factors such as rent, value of their employment contract, cost of clothing, make-up, gift giving, and other expenses ensured that many would spend their entire lives working to pay off their debts. These females were expected to perform dances, sing, play an instrument, gossip or provide companionship so that their guests would come again. As a result, the region developed its own culture which, in turn, determined what would be popular in the rest of the country. This was particularly true for fashion, since a woman's identity was determined by her clothing; specifically, it clarified what her profession and status was within that field. The quality of her attire ensured she stood out from the rest of her competition. It was her only means of establishing a reputation and helped to market her talents. However, Yoshiwara also possessed a seedier side. Much of the business conducted here incorporated the use of prostitution as a means to deal with women's cost of living. As a result, since its establishment was first authorised by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1589,<ref>{{Harvnb|Seigle|1993|p=17}}</ref> this area became the country's government-sanctioned red-light district. This designation lasted for about 250 years.\n\nProfessional female entertainers (''[[geisha]]''), music, popular stories, ''[[Kabuki]]'' and ''[[bunraku]]'' (puppet theater), poetry, a rich literature, and art, exemplified by beautiful woodblock prints (known as ''[[ukiyo-e]]''), were all part of this flowering of culture. Literature also flourished with the talented examples of the playwright [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] (1653\u20131724) and the poet, essayist, and travel writer [[Matsuo Bash\u014d]] (1644\u201394).\n\n[[Matsumura Keibun]] is one of the most significant painters of this period. His works commonly included realistic depictions of birds, flowers and animals.<ref name=BMA>{{Harvnb|Birmingham Museum of Art|2010|pp=42\u201344}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', full-colour [[ukiyo-e]] woodblock print, [[Hokusai]], {{circa|1829\u201332}}]]\n\n[[Ukiyo-e]] is a genre of painting and printmaking that developed in the late 17th century, at first depicting the entertainments of the [[Y\u016bkaku|pleasure districts]] of Edo, such as courtesans and [[kabuki]] actors.  [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]] produced the first full-colour ''[[nishiki-e]]'' prints in 1765, a form that has become synonymous to most with ukiyo-e.  The genre reached a peak in technique towards the end of the century with the works of such artists as [[Torii Kiyonaga|Kiyonaga]] and [[Utamaro]].  As the Edo period came to an end a great diversity of genres proliferated: warriors, nature, folklore, and the landscapes of [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]].  The genre declined throughout the rest of the century in the face of modernization that saw ukiyo-e as both old-fashioned and laborious to produce compared to Western technologies.  Ukiyo-e was a primary part of the wave of [[Japonisme]]<nowiki/> that swept Western art in the late 19th century.\n\n[[Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]] were both still important in Tokugawa Japan. [[Buddhism]], together with [[neo-Confucianism]], provided standards of social behavior. Although Buddhism was not as politically powerful as it had been in the past, Buddhism continued to be espoused by the upper classes. Proscriptions against Christianity benefited Buddhism in 1640 when the bakufu ordered everyone to register at a temple. The rigid separation of Tokugawa society into han, villages, wards, and households helped reaffirm local Shinto attachments. Shinto provided spiritual support to the political order and was an important tie between the individual and the community. Shinto also helped preserve a sense of national identity.\n\n[[File:Plan of edo.jpeg|thumb|Scaled pocket plan of Edo]]\n\n[[Shinto]] eventually assumed an intellectual form as shaped by neo-Confucian rationalism and materialism. The kokugaku movement emerged from the interactions of these two belief systems. Kokugaku contributed to the emperor-centered nationalism of modern Japan and the revival of Shinto as a national creed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The [[Kojiki]], [[Nihon Shoki]], and [[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]] were all studied anew in the search for the Japanese spirit. Some purists in the kokugaku movement, such as [[Motoori Norinaga]], even criticized the Confucian and Buddhist influences\u2014in effect, foreign influences\u2014for contaminating Japan's ancient ways. Japan was the land of the [[kami]] and, as such, had a special destiny.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2003|pp=45\u201347}}</ref>\n\n===Entertainment===\n\nThe Edo period was characterized by an unprecedented series of economic developments (despite termination of contact with the outside world) and cultural maturation, especially in terms of theater, music, and other entertainment.  For example, a poetic meter for music called kinsei kouta-ch\u014d was invented during this time<ref>{{Cite book|title = Song, dance, storytelling: aspects of the performing arts in Japan|url = https://archive.org/details/songdancestoryte0000hoff|url-access = registration|publisher = China-Japan Program, Cornell University|date = 1978-06-01|language = en|first = Frank|last = Hoff|page = [https://archive.org/details/songdancestoryte0000hoff/page/130 130]}}</ref> and is still used today in folk songs.  Music and theater were influenced by the social gap between the noble and commoner classes, and different arts became more defined as this gap widened.  Several different types of [[kabuki]] (theater) emerged.  Some, such as [[shibaraku]], were only available at a certain time of year, while some companies only performed for nobles.  Fashion trends, satirization of local news stories, and advertisements were often part of kabuki theater, as well.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Edo Culture: Daily Life and Diversions in Urban Japan, 1600\u20131868|last = Nishiyama|first = Matsunosuke|publisher = University of Hawai'i Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = 198\u2013227}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Khalili Collection Kimono 03.jpg|thumb|right|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|[[uchikake]]}}), 1840\u20131870, [[Khalili Collection of Kimono]]]]\n=== Fashion ===\nClothing acquired a wide variety of designs and decorative techniques, especially for [[kimono]] worn by women.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=8}} The main consumers of kimono were the [[samurai]] who used lavish clothing and other material luxuries to signal their place at the top of the social order.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=20}} Driven by this [[demand]], the textile industry grew and used increasingly sophisticated methods of weaving, [[dyeing]], and [[embroidery]].{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=20}} Over this period, women adopted brighter colours and bolder designs, whereas women's and men's kimono had been very similar.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=22}} The rise of a [[Bourgeoisie|merchant class]] fuelled more demand for elaborate costumes.

The cause for the end of this period is controversial but is recounted as the forcing of Japan's opening to the world by [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Commodore Matthew Perry]] of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]], whose [[Naval fleet|armada]] (known by Japanese as \"[[Black Ships|the black ships]]\") fired weapons from [[Edo Bay]]. Several [[artificial island|artificial land masses]] were created to block the range of the armada, and this land remains in what is presently called the [[Odaiba]] district.\n\nThe Tokugawa did not eventually collapse simply because of intrinsic failures. Foreign intrusions helped to precipitate a complex political struggle between the ''[[Tokugawa shogunate|bakufu]]'' and a coalition of its critics. The continuity of the anti-''bakufu'' movement in the mid-19th century would finally bring down the Tokugawa. Historians consider that a major contributing factor to the decline of the Tokugawa was \"poor management of the central government by the ''sh\u014dgun'', which caused the social classes in Japan to fall apart\".{{attribution needed|date=February 2018}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Jansen|2002|pp=289\u2013292}}</ref> From the outset, the Tokugawa attempted to restrict families' accumulation of wealth and fostered a \"back to the soil\" policy, in which the farmer, the ultimate producer, was the ideal person in society.\n\nDespite these efforts to restrict wealth and partly because of the extraordinary period of peace, the standard of living for urban and rural dwellers alike grew significantly during the Tokugawa period. Better means of crop production, transport, housing, food, and entertainment were all available, as was more leisure time, at least for urban dwellers. The literacy rate was high for a preindustrial society (by some estimates the literacy rate in the city of Edo was 80 percent), and cultural values were redefined and widely imparted throughout the [[samurai]] and ''[[ch\u014dnin]]'' classes. Despite the reappearance of [[guild]]s, economic activities went well beyond the restrictive nature of the guilds, and commerce spread and a money economy developed. Although government heavily restricted the merchants and viewed them as unproductive and usurious members of society, the samurai, who gradually became separated from their rural ties, depended greatly on the merchants and artisans for consumer goods, artistic interests, and [[loan]]s. In this way, a subtle subversion of the warrior class by the ''ch\u014dnin'' took place.\n\nA struggle arose in the face of political limitations that the ''sh\u014dgun'' imposed on the entrepreneurial class. The government ideal of an [[agrarian society]] failed to square with the reality of commercial distribution. A huge government bureaucracy had evolved, which now stagnated because of its discrepancy with a new and evolving social order. Compounding the situation, the population increased significantly during the first half of the Tokugawa period. Although the magnitude and growth rates are uncertain, there were at least 26 million commoners and about four million members of samurai families and their attendants when the first nationwide census was taken in 1721. Drought, followed by crop shortages and starvation, resulted in twenty great famines between 1675 and 1837. During the Tokugawa period, there were 154 famines, of which 21 were widespread and serious.<ref>{{Citation|last=Turkington|first=David|author-link=David Turkington|title=A Chronology of Japanese History|work=Edo Period (1603-1868)|url=http://www.shikokuhenrotrail.com/japanhistory/edohistory.html|accessdate=May 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625110809/http://www.shikokuhenrotrail.com/japanhistory/edohistory.html|archive-date=June 25, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Peasant unrest grew, and by the late 18th century, mass protests over taxes and food shortages had become commonplace. Newly landless families became tenant farmers, while the displaced rural poor moved into the cities. As the fortunes of previously well-to-do families declined, others moved in to accumulate land, and a new, wealthy farming class emerged. Those people who benefited were able to diversify production and to hire laborers, while others were left discontented. Many samurai fell on hard times and were forced into handicraft production and wage jobs for merchants.\n\nAlthough Japan was able to acquire and refine a wide variety of scientific knowledge, the rapid industrialization of the West during the 18th century created a material gap in terms of technologies and armament between Japan and the West, forcing it to abandon its policy of seclusion and contributing to the end of the Tokugawa regime.\n\nWestern intrusions were on the increase in the early 19th century. Russian warships and traders encroached on [[Karafuto]] (called [[Sakhalin]] under Russian and Soviet control) and on the [[Kuril Islands]], the southernmost of which are considered by the Japanese as the northern islands of [[Hokkaid\u014d]]. A British warship entered Nagasaki harbour searching for enemy Dutch ships in 1808, and other warships and [[whaler]]s were seen in Japanese waters with increasing frequency in the 1810s and 1820s. Whalers and trading ships from the United States also arrived on Japan's shores. Although the Japanese made some minor concessions and allowed some landings, they largely attempted to keep all foreigners out, sometimes using force. ''[[Rangaku]]'' became crucial not only in understanding the foreign \"[[barbarian]]s\" but also in using the knowledge gained from the West to fend them off.\n\nBy the 1830s, there was a general sense of crisis. Famines and [[natural disaster]]s hit hard, and unrest led to a peasant uprising against officials and merchants in Osaka in 1837. Although it lasted only a day, the uprising made a dramatic impression. Remedies came in the form of traditional solutions that sought to reform moral decay rather than address institutional problems. The ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s advisers pushed for a return to the martial spirit, more restrictions on foreign trade and contacts, suppression of ''rangaku'', censorship of literature, and elimination of \"luxury\" in the government and samurai class. Others sought the overthrow of the Tokugawa and espoused the political doctrine of ''[[sonn\u014d j\u014di]]'' (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians), which called for unity under imperial rule and opposed foreign intrusions. The ''bakufu'' persevered for the time being amidst growing concerns over Western successes in establishing colonial enclaves in China following the [[First Opium War]] of 1839\u20131842. More reforms were ordered, especially in the economic sector, to strengthen Japan against the Western threat.\n\nJapan turned down a demand from the United States, which was greatly expanding its own presence in the Asia-Pacific region, to establish [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations when [[James Biddle (commodore)|Commodore James Biddle]] appeared in [[Edo Bay]] with two warships in July 1846.\n\n===End of seclusion===\n[[File:Matthew Calbraith Perry.jpg|thumb|[[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Calbraith Perry]]]]\n[[File:Commodore-Perry-Visit-Kanagawa-1854.jpg|thumb|Landing of Commodore Perry, Officers and Men of the Squadron To meet the Imperial Commissioners at ''Kurihama [[Yokosuka]]'' March 8th, 1854]]\n\nWhen Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]]'s four-ship squadron appeared in Edo Bay in July 1853, the bakufu was thrown into turmoil. The chairman of the senior councillors, [[Abe Masahiro]] (1819\u20131857), was responsible for dealing with the Americans. Having no precedent to manage this threat to [[national security]], Abe tried to balance the desires of the senior councillors to compromise with the foreigners, of the emperor who wanted to keep the foreigners out, and of the ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' who wanted to go to war. Lacking consensus, Abe decided to compromise by accepting Perry's demands for opening Japan to foreign trade while also making military preparations. In March 1854, the Treaty of Peace and Amity (or [[Treaty of Kanagawa]]) opened two ports to American ships seeking provisions, guaranteed good treatment to shipwrecked American sailors, and allowed a United States consul to take up residence in [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]], a seaport on the [[Izu Peninsula]], southwest of Edo. The Treaty of Amity and Commerce Between the U.S. and Japan (Harris Treaty), opening still more areas to American trade, was forced on the ''bakufu'' five years later.\n\nThe resulting damage to the ''bakufu'' was significant. The devalued price for gold in Japan was one immediate, enormous effect.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p51\">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=51}}</ref> The European and American traders purchased gold for its original price on the world market and then sold it to the Chinese for triple the price.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p51\" /> Along with this, cheap goods from these developed nations, like finished cotton, flooded the market forcing many Japanese out of business.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p51\" /> Debate over government policy was unusual and had engendered public criticism of the ''bakufu''. In the hope of enlisting the support of new allies, Abe, to the consternation of the ''fudai'', had consulted with the ''shinpan'' and ''tozama daimy\u014d'', further undermining the already weakened ''bakufu''. In the [[Ansei Reform]] (1854\u20131856), Abe then tried to strengthen the regime by ordering Dutch warships and armaments from the Netherlands and building new port defenses. In 1855, a naval training school with Dutch instructors was set up at Nagasaki, and a Western-style military school was established at Edo; by the next year, the government was translating Western books. Opposition to Abe increased within ''[[fudai]]'' circles, which opposed opening ''bakufu'' councils to ''tozama daimy\u014d'', and he was replaced in 1855 as chairman of the senior councilors by [[Hotta Masayoshi]] (1810\u20131864).\n\nAt the head of the dissident faction was [[Tokugawa Nariaki]], who had long embraced a militant loyalty to the emperor along with anti-foreign sentiments, and who had been put in charge of national defense in 1854. The Mito school\u2014based on neo-Confucian and Shinto principles\u2014had as its goal the restoration of the imperial institution, the turning back of the West, and the founding of a world empire under the divine [[Yamato dynasty]].\n\nIn the final years of the Tokugawas, foreign contacts increased as more concessions were granted. The new treaty with the United States in 1859 allowed more ports to be opened to diplomatic representatives, unsupervised trade at four additional ports, and foreign residences in Osaka and Edo. It also embodied the concept of extraterritoriality (foreigners were subject to the laws of their own countries but not to Japanese law). Hotta lost the support of key ''daimy\u014d'', and when Tokugawa Nariaki opposed the new treaty, Hotta sought imperial sanction. The court officials, perceiving the weakness of the ''bakufu'', rejected Hotta's request and thus suddenly embroiled Kyoto and the emperor in Japan's internal politics for the first time in many centuries. When the ''sh\u014dgun'' died without an [[heir]], Nariaki appealed to the court for support of his own son, [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] (or Keiki), for ''sh\u014dgun'', a candidate favored by the ''[[shinpan]]'' and ''tozama daimy\u014d''. The ''fudai'' won the power struggle, however, installing Tokugawa Yoshitomi, arresting Nariaki and Keiki, executing [[Yoshida Sh\u014din]] (1830\u20131859), a leading ''sonn\u014d-j\u014di'' intellectual who had opposed the American treaty and plotted a revolution against the bakufu), and signing treaties with the United States and five other nations, thus ending more than 200 years of exclusion.\n\nRecently{{when|date=November 2016}} some scholars{{who|date=November 2016}} have suggested that there were more events that spurred this opening of Japan. From 1716 to 1745 Yoshimune (eighth Tokugawa ''sh\u014dgun'' from 1716\u20131745) started the first [[Ky\u014dh\u014d reforms]] in an attempt to gain more revenue for the government.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=42}}</ref> In 1767, to 1786 Tanuma Okitsugu also initiated some unorthodox economic reforms to expand government income.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\" /> This led his conservative opponents to attack him and take his position as he was forced from government in disgrace.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\" /> Similarly, Matsudaira Sadanobu launched the [[Kansei Reforms]] in 1787\u20131793 to stabilize rice prices, cut government costs, and increase revenues.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\" /> The final economic reform of the [[Tenp\u014d]] era of 1841\u20131843 had similar objectives. Most were ineffective and only worked in some areas. These economic failings would also have been a force in the opening of Japan, as Japanese businessmen desired larger markets. Some scholars also point to internal activism for political change. The Mito school had long been an active force in demanding political changes, such as restoring the powers of the Emperor. This anger can also be seen in the poetry of Matsuo Taseko (a woman who farmed silk worms in the Ina Valley) from Hirata Atsutane's School of National Learning:\n<poem>\n\"It is disgusting\nthe agitation over thread\nIn today's world\nEver since the ships\nfrom foreign countries\ncame for the jeweled\nsilkworm cocoons\nto the land of the gods and the Emperor\nPeoples hearts\nawesome though they are,\nare being pulled apart\nand consumed by rage.\"</poem><ref name=\"Gordon2008p52\">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=52}}</ref> This inspired many anti-Tokugawa activists as they blamed the Bakufu for impoverishing the people and dishonoring the emperor.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p52\" />\n[[File:Yoshinobu Tokugawa 2.jpg|thumb|[[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] in later life]]\n[[File:Kanrinmaru.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese warship Kanrin Maru|''Kanrin Maru'']], Japan's first screw-driven steam warship, 1855]]\n\n===Bakumatsu modernization and conflicts===\n[[File:WesternizedSamurai1866.jpg|thumb|Samurai in western clothing of the Tokugawa Shogunate Army (1866).]]\n{{main|Bakumatsu}}\n\nDuring the last years of the ''[[Tokugawa shogunate|bakufu]]'', or ''[[bakumatsu]]'', the ''bakufu'' took strong measures to try to reassert its dominance, although its involvement with modernization and foreign powers was to make it a target of [[anti-Western sentiment]] throughout the country.\n\nThe army and the navy were modernized. A naval training school was established in [[Nagasaki]] in 1855. Naval students were sent to study in Western naval schools for several years, starting a tradition of foreign-educated future leaders, such as Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki|Enomoto]]. French naval engineers were hired to build naval arsenals, such as [[Yokosuka]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. By the end of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1867, the Japanese navy of the ''sh\u014dgun'' already possessed eight Western-style steam warships around the flagship [[Japanese battleship Kaiyo Maru|''Kaiy\u014d Maru'']], which were used against pro-imperial forces during the [[Boshin War]] under the command of Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki|Enomoto]]. A [[Jules Brunet|French military mission]] was established to help modernize the armies of the ''bakufu''.\n\nRevering the emperor as a symbol of unity, extremists wrought violence and death against the Bakufu and Han authorities and foreigners. Foreign naval retaliation in the [[Anglo-Satsuma War]] led to still another concessionary commercial treaty in 1865, but Yoshitomi was unable to enforce the Western treaties. A ''bakufu'' army was defeated when it was sent to crush dissent in the [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain]]s in 1866. Finally, in 1867, [[Emperor K\u014dmei]] died and was succeeded by his underaged son [[Emperor Meiji]].\n\n[[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] reluctantly became head of the Tokugawa house and ''sh\u014dgun''. He tried to reorganize the government under the emperor while preserving the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s leadership role. Fearing the growing power of the Satsuma and Ch\u014dsh\u016b ''daimy\u014d'', other ''daimy\u014d'' called for returning the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s political power to the emperor and a council of ''daimy\u014d'' chaired by the former Tokugawa ''sh\u014dgun''. Yoshinobu accepted the plan in late 1867 and resigned, announcing an \"imperial restoration\". The Satsuma, Ch\u014dsh\u016b, and other ''han'' leaders and radical courtiers, however, [[rebellion|rebelled]], seized the [[Japanese imperial palace|imperial palace]], and announced their own restoration on January 3, 1868.\n\nFollowing the [[Boshin War]] (1868\u20131869), the ''bakufu'' was abolished, and Yoshinobu was reduced to the ranks of the common ''daimy\u014d''. Resistance continued in the North throughout 1868, and the ''bakufu'' [[navy|naval forces]] under Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki]] continued to hold out for another six months in [[Hokkaid\u014d]], where they founded the short-lived [[Republic of Ezo]].\n\n==Events==\n* 1600: [[Battle of Sekigahara]].

The period was characterized by economic growth, strict social order, [[Isolationism|isolationist]] foreign policies, a stable population,  \"no more wars\", and popular enjoyment of arts and culture. The shogunate was officially established in [[Edo]] on March 24, 1603, by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. The period came to an end with the [[Meiji Restoration]] on May 3, 1868, after the [[fall of Edo]].\n\n== Consolidation of the shogunate ==\n{{main|Tokugawa shogunate}}\n[[File:Tokugawa Ieyasu2.JPG|thumb|[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], first ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]]]\n\nA [[revolution]] took place from the time of the [[Kamakura shogunate]], which existed with the [[Tenn\u014d]]'s court, to the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]], when the ''[[samurai]]'' became the unchallenged rulers   in what historian [[Edwin O. Reischauer]] called a \"centralized [[feudal]]\" form of shogunate. Instrumental in the rise of the new-existing [[bakufu]] was [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], the main beneficiary of the achievements of [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. Already powerful, Ieyasu profited by his transfer to the rich [[Kant\u014d region|Kant\u014d]] area. He maintained two million ''[[koku]]'' of land, a new headquarters at [[Edo]], a strategically situated castle town (the future [[Tokyo]]), and also had an additional two million ''koku'' of land and thirty-eight [[vassal]]s under his control. After Hideyoshi's death, Ieyasu moved quickly to seize control from the [[Toyotomi clan]].\n\nIeyasu's victory over the western ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] (October 21, 1600, or in the Japanese calendar on the 15th day of the ninth month of the fifth year of the [[Keich\u014d]] era) gave him control of all [[Japan]]. He rapidly abolished numerous enemy ''daimy\u014d'' houses, reduced others, such as that of the Toyotomi, and redistributed the spoils of war to his family and allies. Ieyasu still failed to achieve complete control of the western ''daimy\u014d'', but his assumption of the title of ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' helped consolidate the alliance system. After further strengthening his power base, Ieyasu installed his son [[Tokugawa Hidetada|Hidetada]] (1579\u20131632) as ''sh\u014dgun'' and himself as retired ''sh\u014dgun'' in 1605. The Toyotomi were still a significant threat, and Ieyasu devoted the next decade to their eradication. In 1615, the Tokugawa army destroyed the Toyotomi stronghold at [[Osaka]].\n\nThe Tokugawa (or Edo) period brought 250 years of stability to Japan. The political system evolved into what historians call ''bakuhan'', a combination of the terms ''bakufu'' and ''[[Han (administrative division)|han]]'' (domains) to describe the government and society of the period.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|McClain|1991|pp=128\u2013182}}</ref> In the ''bakuhan'', the ''sh\u014dgun'' had national authority and the ''daimy\u014d'' had regional authority. This represented a new unity in the feudal structure, which featured an increasingly large bureaucracy to administer the mixture of [[centralized]] and decentralized authorities. The Tokugawa became more powerful during their first century of rule: land redistribution gave them nearly seven million ''koku'', control of the most important cities, and a land assessment system reaping great revenues.\n\nThe  feudal hierarchy was completed by the various classes of ''daimy\u014d''. Closest to the Tokugawa house were the ''[[Shinpan (daimyo)|shinpan]]'', or \"related houses\". They were twenty-three ''daimy\u014d'' on the borders of Tokugawa lands, all directly related to Ieyasu. The shinpan held mostly honorary titles and advisory posts in the bakufu. The second class of the hierarchy were the ''[[fudai]]'', or \"house ''daimy\u014d''\", rewarded with lands close to the Tokugawa holdings for their faithful service. By the 18th century, 145 ''fudai'' controlled much smaller ''han'', the greatest assessed at 250,000 ''koku''. Members of the ''fudai'' class staffed most of the major bakufu offices. Ninety-seven ''han'' formed the third group, the ''[[tozama]]'' (outside vassals), former opponents or new allies. The ''tozama'' were located mostly on the peripheries of the archipelago and collectively controlled nearly ten million ''koku'' of productive land. Because the ''tozama'' were least trusted of the ''daimy\u014d'', they were the most cautiously managed and generously treated, although they were excluded from central [[government]] positions.\n\nThe Tokugawa shogunate not only consolidated their control over a reunified Japan, they also had unprecedented power over the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]], the court, all ''daimy\u014d'' and the religious orders. The emperor was held up as the ultimate source of political sanction for the ''sh\u014dgun'', who ostensibly was the vassal of the imperial family. The Tokugawa helped the imperial family recapture its old glory by rebuilding its palaces and granting it new lands. To ensure a close tie between the imperial clan and the Tokugawa family, Ieyasu's granddaughter was made an imperial consort in 1619.\n\nA code of laws was established to regulate the ''daimy\u014d'' houses. The code encompassed private conduct, marriage, dress, types of weapons and numbers of troops allowed; required feudal lords to reside in Edo every other year (the ''[[sankin-k\u014dtai]]'' system); prohibited the construction of ocean-going ships; proscribed Christianity; restricted castles to one per domain (''han'') and stipulated that bakufu regulations were the national law. Although the ''daimy\u014d'' were not taxed per se, they were regularly levied for contributions for [[military]] and logistical support and for such public works projects as castles, roads, bridges and palaces. The various regulations and levies not only strengthened the Tokugawa but also depleted the wealth of the ''daimy\u014d'', thus weakening their threat to the central administration. The ''han'', once military-centered domains, became mere local [[Administration (government)|administrative]] units. The ''daimy\u014d'' did have full administrative control over their territory and their complex systems of retainers, [[bureaucrat]]s and commoners. Loyalty was exacted from religious foundations, already greatly weakened by Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, through a variety of control mechanisms.\n\n==Foreign trade relations==\n{{main|Sakoku}}\n[[File:HasekuraWithShipDetail.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|San Juan Bautista]]'' is represented in [[Claude Deruet]]'s painting of [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] in Rome in 1617, as a galleon with Hasekura's flag (red manji on orange background) on the top mast.]]\n[[File:Hasekura Travels.jpg|thumb|Itinerary and dates of the travels of Hasekura Tsunenaga]]\n[[File:Kawahara Nagasaki.jpg|thumb|right|Bird's-eye view of the Nagasaki bay, with the island [[Dejima]] at mid-left (1820). ]]\n\nLike Hideyoshi, Ieyasu encouraged foreign trade but also was suspicious of outsiders. He wanted to make Edo a major port, but once he learned that the Europeans favored ports in [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] and that China had rejected his plans for official trade, he moved to control existing trade and allowed only certain ports to handle specific kinds of commodities.\n\nThe beginning of the Edo period coincides with the last decades of the [[Nanban trade period]] during which intense interaction with European powers, on the economic and religious plane, took place. It is at the beginning of the Edo period that Japan built its first ocean-going Western-style [[warships]], such as the [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''San Juan Bautista'']], a 500-[[ton]] [[galleon]]-type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] to the Americas and then to Europe. Also during that period, the ''bakufu'' commissioned around 720 [[Red Seal Ships]], three-masted and armed trade ships, for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as [[Yamada Nagamasa]], used those ships throughout Asia.\n\nThe \"Christian problem\" was, in effect, a problem of controlling both the Christian ''daimy\u014d'' in Ky\u016bsh\u016b and their trade with the [[Europeans]]. By 1612, the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s retainers and residents of Tokugawa lands had been ordered to forswear Christianity. More restrictions came in 1616 (the restriction of foreign trade to Nagasaki and Hirado, an island northwest of Ky\u016bsh\u016b), 1622 (the execution of 120 missionaries and converts), 1624 (the expulsion of the Spanish), and 1629 (the execution of thousands of Christians). Finally, the [[Closed Country Edict of 1635]] prohibited any Japanese from traveling outside Japan or, if someone left, from ever returning. In 1636, the Dutch were restricted to [[Dejima]], a small [[artificial island]]\u2014and thus, not true Japanese soil\u2014in Nagasaki's harbor.\n\nThe shogunate perceived Catholic Christianity to be an extremely destabilizing factor, and so decided to target it. The [[Shimabara Rebellion]] of 1637\u201338, in which discontented Catholic Christian samurai and peasants rebelled against the bakufu\u2014and Edo called in Dutch ships to bombard the rebel stronghold\u2014marked the end of the Christian movement, although some [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christians survived by going underground, the so-called [[Kakure Kirishitan]]. Soon thereafter, the Portuguese were permanently expelled, members of the Portuguese diplomatic mission were executed, all subjects were ordered to register at a Buddhist or Shinto temple, and the Dutch and Chinese were restricted, respectively, to Dejima and to a special quarter in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. Besides small trade of some outer ''daimy\u014d'' with [[Korea]] and the [[Ryukyu Islands]], to the southwest of Japan's main islands, by 1641, foreign contacts were limited by the policy of ''[[sakoku]]'' to Nagasaki.\n\nThe last Jesuit was either killed or reconverted by 1644<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|McClain|1991|pp=369\u2013370}}</ref> and by the 1660s, Christianity was almost completely eradicated, and its external political, economic, and religious influence on Japan became quite limited.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|McClain|1991|p=370}}</ref> Only China, the [[Dutch East India Company]], and for a short period, the English, enjoyed the right to visit Japan during this period, for commercial purposes only, and they were restricted to the [[Dejima]] port in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. Other Europeans who landed on Japanese shores were put to death without trial.\n\n==Society==\n{{main|Edo society}}\n[[File:Edo Hibachi.JPG|thumb|The house of the merchant ''([http://www.kcf.or.jp/fukagawa/ Fukagawa Edo Museum])'']]\n[[File:Edo social structure.svg|thumb|Social classes during the Edo period ([[Tokugawa shogunate]]).]]\nDuring the Tokugawa period, the social order, based on inherited position rather than personal merits, was rigid and highly formalized. At the top were the emperor and court nobles (''[[kuge]]''), together with the ''sh\u014dgun'' and ''daimy\u014d''. Below them the population was divided into [[Four divisions of society|four classes]] in a system known as ''mibunsei'' (\u8eab\u5206\u5236): the samurai on top (about 5% of the population) and the peasants (more than 80% of the population) on the second level. Below the peasants were the craftsmen, and even below them, on the fourth level, were the merchants.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beasley|1972|p=22}}</ref> Only the peasants lived in the rural areas. Samurai, craftsmen and merchants lived in the [[j\u014dkamachi|cities]] that were built around ''daimy\u014d'' [[Japanese castle|castles]], each restricted to their own quarter. Edo society had an elaborate social structure, in which every family knew its place and level of prestige.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=John W.|date=Autumn 1974|title=Rule by Status in Tokugawa Japan|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/133436?origin=crossref|journal=Journal of Japanese Studies|volume=1|issue=1|pages=39|doi=10.2307/133436|via=JSTOR}}</ref>\n\nAt the top were the Emperor and the court nobility, invincible in prestige but weak in power. Next came the [[sh\u014dgun]], ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' and layers of feudal lords whose rank was indicated by their closeness to the Tokugawa. They had power. The ''daimy\u014d'' comprised about 250 local lords of local \"han\" with annual outputs of 50,000 or more bushels of rice. The upper strata was much given to elaborate and expensive rituals, including elegant architecture, landscaped gardens, Noh drama, patronage of the arts, and the tea ceremony.{{sfn|Totman|2000|pp= 225\u2013230}}\n\nThen came the 400,000 warriors, called \"[[samurai]]\", in numerous grades and degrees. A few upper samurai were eligible for high office; most were foot soldiers (ashigaru). Since there was very little fighting, they became civil servants paid by the daimyo, with minor duties. The samurai were affiliated with senior lords in a well-established chain of command. The shogun had 17,000 samurai retainers; the daimyo each had hundreds. Most lived in modest homes near their lord's headquarters, and lived off of hereditary rights and stipends. Together these high status groups comprised Japan's ruling class making up about 6% of the total population.\n\nAfter a long period of inner conflict, the first goal of the newly established Tokugawa government was to pacify the country. It created a balance of power that remained (fairly) stable for the next 250 years, influenced by [[Confucianism|Confucian]] principles of [[social order]]. Most [[samurai]] lost their direct possession of the land: the ''daimy\u014d'' took over their land.  The samurai had a choice: give up their sword and become peasants, or move to the city of their feudal lord and become a paid retainer. Only a few land samurai remained in the border provinces of the north, or as direct vassals of the ''sh\u014dgun'', the 5,000 so-called ''[[hatamoto]]''. The ''daimy\u014d'' were put under tight control of the shogunate. Their families had to reside in Edo; the ''daimy\u014d'' themselves had to reside in Edo for one year and in their province (''[[Han (administrative division)|han]]'') for the next. This system was called ''[[sankin-k\u014dtai]]''.<ref>Michael Wert, ''Samurai: A Concise History'' (2019).</ref>\n\nLower orders divided into two main segments\u2014the peasants\u201480% of the population\u2014whose high prestige as producers was undercut by their burden as the chief source of taxes. They were illiterate and lived in villages controlled by appointed officials who kept the peace and collected taxes.\nThe family was the smallest legal entity, and the maintenance of family status and privileges was of great importance at all levels of society.  The individual had no separate legal rights. The 1711 ''Got\u014dke reij\u014d'' was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2003|pp=31\u201332}}</ref>\n\nOutside the four classes were the so-called ''[[Burakumin|eta]]'' and ''hinin'', those whose professions broke the taboos of Buddhism. ''Eta'' were butchers, tanners and undertakers. ''Hinin'' served as town guards, street cleaners, and executioners. Other outsiders included the beggars, entertainers, and prostitutes. The word ''eta'' literally translates to \"filthy\" and ''hinin'' to \"non-humans\", a thorough reflection of the attitude held by other classes that the ''eta'' and ''hinin'' were not even people.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 313\">{{harvnb|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|2002|p=313}}</ref> ''Hinin'' were only allowed inside a special quarter of the city. Other persecution of the hinin included disallowing them from wearing robes longer than knee-length and the wearing of hats.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 313\"/> Sometimes ''eta'' villages were not even printed on official maps. A sub-class of hinin who were born into their social class had no option of mobility to a different social class whereas the other class of hinin who had lost their previous class status could be reinstated in Japanese society.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 313\"/> In the 19th century the umbrella term ''burakumin'' was coined to name the ''eta'' and ''hinin'' because both classes were forced to live in separate village neighborhoods.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 93\">{{harvnb|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|2002|p=93}}</ref> The ''eta'', ''hinin'' and ''burakumin'' classes were officially abolished in 1871.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 313\"/> However, their cultural and societal impact, including some forms of discrimination, continues into modern times.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 93\"/>\n\n{{wide image|Edo Panorama old Tokyo color photochrom.jpg|1200px|Edo, 1865 or 1866.

Economic development during the Tokugawa period included [[urbanization]], increased shipping of commodities, a significant expansion of domestic and, initially, foreign commerce, and a diffusion of trade and [[handicraft]] industries. The construction trades flourished, along with banking facilities and merchant associations. Increasingly, [[Han (administrative division)|''han'']] authorities oversaw the rising agricultural production and the spread of rural handicrafts.<ref>Kozo Yamamura, \"Toward a reexamination of the economic history of Tokugawa Japan, 1600\u20131867.\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 33.3 (1973): 509-546.

Many other [[castle town]]s grew as well. Japan had almost [[zero population growth]] between the 1720s and 1820s, often attributed to lower birth rates in response to widespread famine, but some historians have presented different theories, such as a high rate of infanticide artificially controlling population.<ref>{{Harvnb|Flath|2000}}</ref> Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers, while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods.\n\n===Economy===\nThe Tokugawa era brought peace, and that brought prosperity to a nation of 31 million, 80% of them rice farmers.  Rice production increased steadily, but population remained stable.

In the cities and towns, guilds of merchants and artisans met the growing demand for goods and services.<ref>Conrad Totman, ''A History of Japan'' (2nd ed. 2000) ch 11.</ref>\n\nThe merchants benefited enormously, especially those with official patronage. The samurai, forbidden to engage in farming or business but allowed to borrow money, borrowed too much. The bakufu and daimyos raised taxes on farmers, but did not tax business, so they too fell into debt. By 1750 rising taxes incited peasant unrest and even revolt.  The nation had to deal somehow with samurai impoverishment and treasury deficits. The financial troubles of the samurai undermined their loyalties to the system, and the empty treasury threatened the whole system of government. One solution was reactionary\u2014with prohibitions on spending for luxuries. Other solutions were modernizing, with the goal of increasing agrarian productivity.  The eighth Tokugawa shogun, Yoshimune (in office 1716-1745) had considerable success, though much of his work had to be done again between 1787 and 1793 by the shogun's chief councilor Matsudaira Sadanobu (1759-1829). Others shoguns debased the coinage to pay debts, which caused inflation.\n\nBy 1800 the commercialization of the economy grew rapidly, bringing more and more remote villages into the national economy. Rich farmers appeared who switched from rice to high-profit commercial crops and engaged in local money-lending, trade, and small-scale manufacturing. Some wealthy merchants sought higher social status by using money to marry into the samurai class.\n\n====Agriculture====\n[[Rice]] was the base of the economy.  About 80% of the people were rice farmers.<ref>Susan B.

Taxes were high, about 40% of the harvest. The rice was sold at the ''[[fudasashi]]'' market in Edo. To raise money, the ''daimy\u014d'' used [[forward contract]]s to sell rice that was not even harvested yet. These contracts were similar to modern [[futures trading]].\n\nIt was during the Edo period that Japan developed an advanced [[forest management]] policy. Increased demand for timber resources for construction, shipbuilding and fuel had led to widespread deforestation, which resulted in forest fires, floods and soil erosion. In response the ''sh\u014dgun'', beginning around 1666, instituted a policy to reduce logging and increase the planting of trees. The policy mandated that only the ''sh\u014dgun'' and ''daimy\u014d'' could authorize the use of wood. By the 18th century, Japan had developed detailed scientific knowledge about [[silviculture]] and plantation [[forestry]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Diamond|2005|pp=297\u2013304}}</ref>\n\n===Financial services===\nThe merchants benefited enormously, especially those with official patronage.

The financial crisis provoked a reactionary solution near the end of the \"Tempo era\" (1830-1843) promulgated by the chief counselor Mizuno Tadakuni. He raised taxes, denounced luxuries and tried to impede the growth of business; he failed and it appeared to many that the continued existence of the entire Tokugawa system was in jeopardy.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McClain|first=James L.|url=|title=Japan, a modern history|date=2002|publisher=W.W.

The main areas that were studied included geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, art, languages, physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena, and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches, or [[wadokei]], inspired by Western techniques.\n\nThe flourishing of [[Neo-Confucianism]] was the major intellectual development of the Tokugawa period. [[Confucianism|Confucian]] studies had long been kept active in Japan by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] clerics, but during the Tokugawa period, Confucianism emerged from Buddhist religious control. This system of thought increased attention to a secular view of man and society. The ethical [[humanism]], [[rationalism]], and historical perspective of neo-Confucian doctrine appealed to the official class. By the mid-17th century, neo-Confucianism was Japan's dominant legal philosophy and contributed directly to the development of the ''[[kokugaku]]'' (national learning) school of thought.\n\nAdvanced studies and growing applications of neo-Confucianism contributed to the transition of the social and political order from feudal norms to class- and large-group-oriented practices. The rule of the people or Confucian man was gradually replaced by the [[rule of law]]. New laws were developed, and new administrative devices were instituted. A new theory of government and a new vision of society emerged as a means of justifying more comprehensive governance by the bakufu. Each person had a distinct place in society and was expected to work to fulfill his or her mission in life. The people were to be ruled with benevolence by those whose assigned duty it was to rule. Government was all-powerful but responsible and humane. Although the class system was influenced by neo-Confucianism, it was not identical to it. Whereas soldiers and clergy were at the bottom of the hierarchy in the Chinese model, in Japan, some members of these classes constituted the ruling elite.\n\nMembers of the [[samurai]] class adhered to bushi traditions with a renewed interest in Japanese history and in cultivation of the ways of Confucian scholar-administrators. Another special way of life\u2014''ch\u014dnind\u014d''\u2014also emerged. ''[[Ch\u014dnind\u014d]]'' (\"the way of the townspeople\") was a distinct culture that arose in cities such as [[Osaka]], [[Kyoto]], and Edo. It encouraged aspiration to bushido qualities\u2014diligence, honesty, honor, loyalty, and frugality\u2014while blending [[Shinto]], neo-Confucian, and Buddhist beliefs. Study of mathematics, astronomy, cartography, engineering, and medicine were also encouraged. Emphasis was placed on quality of workmanship, especially in the arts.\n\nFor the first time, urban populations had the means and leisure time to support a new mass culture. Their search for enjoyment became known as ''[[ukiyo]]'' (the floating world), an ideal world of fashion, popular entertainment, and the discovery of aesthetic qualities in objects and actions of everyday life.  This increasing interest in pursuing recreational activities helped to develop an array of new industries, many of which could be found in an area known as Yoshiwara. The region was better known for being the center of Edo's developing sense of elegance and refinement. This place of pleasure and luxury became a destination for the elite and wealthy merchants who wished to flaunt their fortune.<ref>{{Harvnb|Longstreet|Longstreet|1989|p=2}}</ref> Their economy relied primarily on the patronage of such individuals in order to sustain itself. For many of those who inhabited and worked in this region maintaining the illusion of grandeur was the only way of supporting their business.\n\n[[File:First Japanese treatise on Western anatomy.jpg|thumb|''[[Kaitai Shinsho]]'', Japan's first treatise on Western [[anatomy]], published in 1774]]\n\nYoshiwara was home to mostly women who, due to unfortunate circumstances, found themselves working in this secluded environment. Combining factors such as rent, value of their employment contract, cost of clothing, make-up, gift giving, and other expenses ensured that many would spend their entire lives working to pay off their debts. These females were expected to perform dances, sing, play an instrument, gossip or provide companionship so that their guests would come again. As a result, the region developed its own culture which, in turn, determined what would be popular in the rest of the country. This was particularly true for fashion, since a woman's identity was determined by her clothing; specifically, it clarified what her profession and status was within that field. The quality of her attire ensured she stood out from the rest of her competition. It was her only means of establishing a reputation and helped to market her talents. However, Yoshiwara also possessed a seedier side. Much of the business conducted here incorporated the use of prostitution as a means to deal with women's cost of living. As a result, since its establishment was first authorised by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1589,<ref>{{Harvnb|Seigle|1993|p=17}}</ref> this area became the country's government-sanctioned red-light district. This designation lasted for about 250 years.\n\nProfessional female entertainers (''[[geisha]]''), music, popular stories, ''[[Kabuki]]'' and ''[[bunraku]]'' (puppet theater), poetry, a rich literature, and art, exemplified by beautiful woodblock prints (known as ''[[ukiyo-e]]''), were all part of this flowering of culture. Literature also flourished with the talented examples of the playwright [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] (1653\u20131724) and the poet, essayist, and travel writer [[Matsuo Bash\u014d]] (1644\u201394).\n\n[[Matsumura Keibun]] is one of the most significant painters of this period. His works commonly included realistic depictions of birds, flowers and animals.<ref name=BMA>{{Harvnb|Birmingham Museum of Art|2010|pp=42\u201344}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', full-colour [[ukiyo-e]] woodblock print, [[Hokusai]], {{circa|1829\u201332}}]]\n\n[[Ukiyo-e]] is a genre of painting and printmaking that developed in the late 17th century, at first depicting the entertainments of the [[Y\u016bkaku|pleasure districts]] of Edo, such as courtesans and [[kabuki]] actors.  [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]] produced the first full-colour ''[[nishiki-e]]'' prints in 1765, a form that has become synonymous to most with ukiyo-e.  The genre reached a peak in technique towards the end of the century with the works of such artists as [[Torii Kiyonaga|Kiyonaga]] and [[Utamaro]].  As the Edo period came to an end a great diversity of genres proliferated: warriors, nature, folklore, and the landscapes of [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]].  The genre declined throughout the rest of the century in the face of modernization that saw ukiyo-e as both old-fashioned and laborious to produce compared to Western technologies.  Ukiyo-e was a primary part of the wave of [[Japonisme]]<nowiki/> that swept Western art in the late 19th century.\n\n[[Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]] were both still important in Tokugawa Japan. [[Buddhism]], together with [[neo-Confucianism]], provided standards of social behavior. Although Buddhism was not as politically powerful as it had been in the past, Buddhism continued to be espoused by the upper classes. Proscriptions against Christianity benefited Buddhism in 1640 when the bakufu ordered everyone to register at a temple. The rigid separation of Tokugawa society into han, villages, wards, and households helped reaffirm local Shinto attachments. Shinto provided spiritual support to the political order and was an important tie between the individual and the community. Shinto also helped preserve a sense of national identity.\n\n[[File:Plan of edo.jpeg|thumb|Scaled pocket plan of Edo]]\n\n[[Shinto]] eventually assumed an intellectual form as shaped by neo-Confucian rationalism and materialism. The kokugaku movement emerged from the interactions of these two belief systems. Kokugaku contributed to the emperor-centered nationalism of modern Japan and the revival of Shinto as a national creed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The [[Kojiki]], [[Nihon Shoki]], and [[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]] were all studied anew in the search for the Japanese spirit. Some purists in the kokugaku movement, such as [[Motoori Norinaga]], even criticized the Confucian and Buddhist influences\u2014in effect, foreign influences\u2014for contaminating Japan's ancient ways. Japan was the land of the [[kami]] and, as such, had a special destiny.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2003|pp=45\u201347}}</ref>\n\n===Entertainment===\n\nThe Edo period was characterized by an unprecedented series of economic developments (despite termination of contact with the outside world) and cultural maturation, especially in terms of theater, music, and other entertainment.  For example, a poetic meter for music called kinsei kouta-ch\u014d was invented during this time<ref>{{Cite book|title = Song, dance, storytelling: aspects of the performing arts in Japan|url = https://archive.org/details/songdancestoryte0000hoff|url-access = registration|publisher = China-Japan Program, Cornell University|date = 1978-06-01|language = en|first = Frank|last = Hoff|page = [https://archive.org/details/songdancestoryte0000hoff/page/130 130]}}</ref> and is still used today in folk songs.  Music and theater were influenced by the social gap between the noble and commoner classes, and different arts became more defined as this gap widened.  Several different types of [[kabuki]] (theater) emerged.  Some, such as [[shibaraku]], were only available at a certain time of year, while some companies only performed for nobles.  Fashion trends, satirization of local news stories, and advertisements were often part of kabuki theater, as well.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Edo Culture: Daily Life and Diversions in Urban Japan, 1600\u20131868|last = Nishiyama|first = Matsunosuke|publisher = University of Hawai'i Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = 198\u2013227}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Khalili Collection Kimono 03.jpg|thumb|right|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|[[uchikake]]}}), 1840\u20131870, [[Khalili Collection of Kimono]]]]\n=== Fashion ===\nClothing acquired a wide variety of designs and decorative techniques, especially for [[kimono]] worn by women.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=8}} The main consumers of kimono were the [[samurai]] who used lavish clothing and other material luxuries to signal their place at the top of the social order.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=20}} Driven by this [[demand]], the textile industry grew and used increasingly sophisticated methods of weaving, [[dyeing]], and [[embroidery]].{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=20}} Over this period, women adopted brighter colours and bolder designs, whereas women's and men's kimono had been very similar.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=22}} The rise of a [[Bourgeoisie|merchant class]] fuelled more demand for elaborate costumes.

The cause for the end of this period is controversial but is recounted as the forcing of Japan's opening to the world by [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Commodore Matthew Perry]] of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]], whose [[Naval fleet|armada]] (known by Japanese as \"[[Black Ships|the black ships]]\") fired weapons from [[Edo Bay]]. Several [[artificial island|artificial land masses]] were created to block the range of the armada, and this land remains in what is presently called the [[Odaiba]] district.\n\nThe Tokugawa did not eventually collapse simply because of intrinsic failures. Foreign intrusions helped to precipitate a complex political struggle between the ''[[Tokugawa shogunate|bakufu]]'' and a coalition of its critics. The continuity of the anti-''bakufu'' movement in the mid-19th century would finally bring down the Tokugawa. Historians consider that a major contributing factor to the decline of the Tokugawa was \"poor management of the central government by the ''sh\u014dgun'', which caused the social classes in Japan to fall apart\".{{attribution needed|date=February 2018}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Jansen|2002|pp=289\u2013292}}</ref> From the outset, the Tokugawa attempted to restrict families' accumulation of wealth and fostered a \"back to the soil\" policy, in which the farmer, the ultimate producer, was the ideal person in society.\n\nDespite these efforts to restrict wealth and partly because of the extraordinary period of peace, the standard of living for urban and rural dwellers alike grew significantly during the Tokugawa period. Better means of crop production, transport, housing, food, and entertainment were all available, as was more leisure time, at least for urban dwellers. The literacy rate was high for a preindustrial society (by some estimates the literacy rate in the city of Edo was 80 percent), and cultural values were redefined and widely imparted throughout the [[samurai]] and ''[[ch\u014dnin]]'' classes. Despite the reappearance of [[guild]]s, economic activities went well beyond the restrictive nature of the guilds, and commerce spread and a money economy developed. Although government heavily restricted the merchants and viewed them as unproductive and usurious members of society, the samurai, who gradually became separated from their rural ties, depended greatly on the merchants and artisans for consumer goods, artistic interests, and [[loan]]s. In this way, a subtle subversion of the warrior class by the ''ch\u014dnin'' took place.\n\nA struggle arose in the face of political limitations that the ''sh\u014dgun'' imposed on the entrepreneurial class. The government ideal of an [[agrarian society]] failed to square with the reality of commercial distribution. A huge government bureaucracy had evolved, which now stagnated because of its discrepancy with a new and evolving social order. Compounding the situation, the population increased significantly during the first half of the Tokugawa period. Although the magnitude and growth rates are uncertain, there were at least 26 million commoners and about four million members of samurai families and their attendants when the first nationwide census was taken in 1721. Drought, followed by crop shortages and starvation, resulted in twenty great famines between 1675 and 1837. During the Tokugawa period, there were 154 famines, of which 21 were widespread and serious.<ref>{{Citation|last=Turkington|first=David|author-link=David Turkington|title=A Chronology of Japanese History|work=Edo Period (1603-1868)|url=http://www.shikokuhenrotrail.com/japanhistory/edohistory.html|accessdate=May 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625110809/http://www.shikokuhenrotrail.com/japanhistory/edohistory.html|archive-date=June 25, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Peasant unrest grew, and by the late 18th century, mass protests over taxes and food shortages had become commonplace. Newly landless families became tenant farmers, while the displaced rural poor moved into the cities. As the fortunes of previously well-to-do families declined, others moved in to accumulate land, and a new, wealthy farming class emerged. Those people who benefited were able to diversify production and to hire laborers, while others were left discontented. Many samurai fell on hard times and were forced into handicraft production and wage jobs for merchants.\n\nAlthough Japan was able to acquire and refine a wide variety of scientific knowledge, the rapid industrialization of the West during the 18th century created a material gap in terms of technologies and armament between Japan and the West, forcing it to abandon its policy of seclusion and contributing to the end of the Tokugawa regime.\n\nWestern intrusions were on the increase in the early 19th century. Russian warships and traders encroached on [[Karafuto]] (called [[Sakhalin]] under Russian and Soviet control) and on the [[Kuril Islands]], the southernmost of which are considered by the Japanese as the northern islands of [[Hokkaid\u014d]]. A British warship entered Nagasaki harbour searching for enemy Dutch ships in 1808, and other warships and [[whaler]]s were seen in Japanese waters with increasing frequency in the 1810s and 1820s. Whalers and trading ships from the United States also arrived on Japan's shores. Although the Japanese made some minor concessions and allowed some landings, they largely attempted to keep all foreigners out, sometimes using force. ''[[Rangaku]]'' became crucial not only in understanding the foreign \"[[barbarian]]s\" but also in using the knowledge gained from the West to fend them off.\n\nBy the 1830s, there was a general sense of crisis. Famines and [[natural disaster]]s hit hard, and unrest led to a peasant uprising against officials and merchants in Osaka in 1837. Although it lasted only a day, the uprising made a dramatic impression. Remedies came in the form of traditional solutions that sought to reform moral decay rather than address institutional problems. The ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s advisers pushed for a return to the martial spirit, more restrictions on foreign trade and contacts, suppression of ''rangaku'', censorship of literature, and elimination of \"luxury\" in the government and samurai class. Others sought the overthrow of the Tokugawa and espoused the political doctrine of ''[[sonn\u014d j\u014di]]'' (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians), which called for unity under imperial rule and opposed foreign intrusions. The ''bakufu'' persevered for the time being amidst growing concerns over Western successes in establishing colonial enclaves in China following the [[First Opium War]] of 1839\u20131842. More reforms were ordered, especially in the economic sector, to strengthen Japan against the Western threat.\n\nJapan turned down a demand from the United States, which was greatly expanding its own presence in the Asia-Pacific region, to establish [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations when [[James Biddle (commodore)|Commodore James Biddle]] appeared in [[Edo Bay]] with two warships in July 1846.\n\n===End of seclusion===\n[[File:Matthew Calbraith Perry.jpg|thumb|[[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Calbraith Perry]]]]\n[[File:Commodore-Perry-Visit-Kanagawa-1854.jpg|thumb|Landing of Commodore Perry, Officers and Men of the Squadron To meet the Imperial Commissioners at ''Kurihama [[Yokosuka]]'' March 8th, 1854]]\n\nWhen Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]]'s four-ship squadron appeared in Edo Bay in July 1853, the bakufu was thrown into turmoil. The chairman of the senior councillors, [[Abe Masahiro]] (1819\u20131857), was responsible for dealing with the Americans. Having no precedent to manage this threat to [[national security]], Abe tried to balance the desires of the senior councillors to compromise with the foreigners, of the emperor who wanted to keep the foreigners out, and of the ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' who wanted to go to war. Lacking consensus, Abe decided to compromise by accepting Perry's demands for opening Japan to foreign trade while also making military preparations. In March 1854, the Treaty of Peace and Amity (or [[Treaty of Kanagawa]]) opened two ports to American ships seeking provisions, guaranteed good treatment to shipwrecked American sailors, and allowed a United States consul to take up residence in [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]], a seaport on the [[Izu Peninsula]], southwest of Edo. The Treaty of Amity and Commerce Between the U.S. and Japan (Harris Treaty), opening still more areas to American trade, was forced on the ''bakufu'' five years later.\n\nThe resulting damage to the ''bakufu'' was significant. The devalued price for gold in Japan was one immediate, enormous effect.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p51\">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=51}}</ref> The European and American traders purchased gold for its original price on the world market and then sold it to the Chinese for triple the price.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p51\" /> Along with this, cheap goods from these developed nations, like finished cotton, flooded the market forcing many Japanese out of business.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p51\" /> Debate over government policy was unusual and had engendered public criticism of the ''bakufu''. In the hope of enlisting the support of new allies, Abe, to the consternation of the ''fudai'', had consulted with the ''shinpan'' and ''tozama daimy\u014d'', further undermining the already weakened ''bakufu''. In the [[Ansei Reform]] (1854\u20131856), Abe then tried to strengthen the regime by ordering Dutch warships and armaments from the Netherlands and building new port defenses. In 1855, a naval training school with Dutch instructors was set up at Nagasaki, and a Western-style military school was established at Edo; by the next year, the government was translating Western books. Opposition to Abe increased within ''[[fudai]]'' circles, which opposed opening ''bakufu'' councils to ''tozama daimy\u014d'', and he was replaced in 1855 as chairman of the senior councilors by [[Hotta Masayoshi]] (1810\u20131864).\n\nAt the head of the dissident faction was [[Tokugawa Nariaki]], who had long embraced a militant loyalty to the emperor along with anti-foreign sentiments, and who had been put in charge of national defense in 1854. The Mito school\u2014based on neo-Confucian and Shinto principles\u2014had as its goal the restoration of the imperial institution, the turning back of the West, and the founding of a world empire under the divine [[Yamato dynasty]].\n\nIn the final years of the Tokugawas, foreign contacts increased as more concessions were granted. The new treaty with the United States in 1859 allowed more ports to be opened to diplomatic representatives, unsupervised trade at four additional ports, and foreign residences in Osaka and Edo. It also embodied the concept of extraterritoriality (foreigners were subject to the laws of their own countries but not to Japanese law). Hotta lost the support of key ''daimy\u014d'', and when Tokugawa Nariaki opposed the new treaty, Hotta sought imperial sanction. The court officials, perceiving the weakness of the ''bakufu'', rejected Hotta's request and thus suddenly embroiled Kyoto and the emperor in Japan's internal politics for the first time in many centuries. When the ''sh\u014dgun'' died without an [[heir]], Nariaki appealed to the court for support of his own son, [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] (or Keiki), for ''sh\u014dgun'', a candidate favored by the ''[[shinpan]]'' and ''tozama daimy\u014d''. The ''fudai'' won the power struggle, however, installing Tokugawa Yoshitomi, arresting Nariaki and Keiki, executing [[Yoshida Sh\u014din]] (1830\u20131859), a leading ''sonn\u014d-j\u014di'' intellectual who had opposed the American treaty and plotted a revolution against the bakufu), and signing treaties with the United States and five other nations, thus ending more than 200 years of exclusion.\n\nRecently{{when|date=November 2016}} some scholars{{who|date=November 2016}} have suggested that there were more events that spurred this opening of Japan. From 1716 to 1745 Yoshimune (eighth Tokugawa ''sh\u014dgun'' from 1716\u20131745) started the first [[Ky\u014dh\u014d reforms]] in an attempt to gain more revenue for the government.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=42}}</ref> In 1767, to 1786 Tanuma Okitsugu also initiated some unorthodox economic reforms to expand government income.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\" /> This led his conservative opponents to attack him and take his position as he was forced from government in disgrace.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\" /> Similarly, Matsudaira Sadanobu launched the [[Kansei Reforms]] in 1787\u20131793 to stabilize rice prices, cut government costs, and increase revenues.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\" /> The final economic reform of the [[Tenp\u014d]] era of 1841\u20131843 had similar objectives. Most were ineffective and only worked in some areas. These economic failings would also have been a force in the opening of Japan, as Japanese businessmen desired larger markets. Some scholars also point to internal activism for political change. The Mito school had long been an active force in demanding political changes, such as restoring the powers of the Emperor. This anger can also be seen in the poetry of Matsuo Taseko (a woman who farmed silk worms in the Ina Valley) from Hirata Atsutane's School of National Learning:\n<poem>\n\"It is disgusting\nthe agitation over thread\nIn today's world\nEver since the ships\nfrom foreign countries\ncame for the jeweled\nsilkworm cocoons\nto the land of the gods and the Emperor\nPeoples hearts\nawesome though they are,\nare being pulled apart\nand consumed by rage.\"</poem><ref name=\"Gordon2008p52\">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=52}}</ref> This inspired many anti-Tokugawa activists as they blamed the Bakufu for impoverishing the people and dishonoring the emperor.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p52\" />\n[[File:Yoshinobu Tokugawa 2.jpg|thumb|[[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] in later life]]\n[[File:Kanrinmaru.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese warship Kanrin Maru|''Kanrin Maru'']], Japan's first screw-driven steam warship, 1855]]\n\n===Bakumatsu modernization and conflicts===\n[[File:WesternizedSamurai1866.jpg|thumb|Samurai in western clothing of the Tokugawa Shogunate Army (1866).]]\n{{main|Bakumatsu}}\n\nDuring the last years of the ''[[Tokugawa shogunate|bakufu]]'', or ''[[bakumatsu]]'', the ''bakufu'' took strong measures to try to reassert its dominance, although its involvement with modernization and foreign powers was to make it a target of [[anti-Western sentiment]] throughout the country.\n\nThe army and the navy were modernized. A naval training school was established in [[Nagasaki]] in 1855. Naval students were sent to study in Western naval schools for several years, starting a tradition of foreign-educated future leaders, such as Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki|Enomoto]]. French naval engineers were hired to build naval arsenals, such as [[Yokosuka]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. By the end of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1867, the Japanese navy of the ''sh\u014dgun'' already possessed eight Western-style steam warships around the flagship [[Japanese battleship Kaiyo Maru|''Kaiy\u014d Maru'']], which were used against pro-imperial forces during the [[Boshin War]] under the command of Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki|Enomoto]]. A [[Jules Brunet|French military mission]] was established to help modernize the armies of the ''bakufu''.\n\nRevering the emperor as a symbol of unity, extremists wrought violence and death against the Bakufu and Han authorities and foreigners. Foreign naval retaliation in the [[Anglo-Satsuma War]] led to still another concessionary commercial treaty in 1865, but Yoshitomi was unable to enforce the Western treaties. A ''bakufu'' army was defeated when it was sent to crush dissent in the [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain]]s in 1866. Finally, in 1867, [[Emperor K\u014dmei]] died and was succeeded by his underaged son [[Emperor Meiji]].\n\n[[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] reluctantly became head of the Tokugawa house and ''sh\u014dgun''. He tried to reorganize the government under the emperor while preserving the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s leadership role. Fearing the growing power of the Satsuma and Ch\u014dsh\u016b ''daimy\u014d'', other ''daimy\u014d'' called for returning the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s political power to the emperor and a council of ''daimy\u014d'' chaired by the former Tokugawa ''sh\u014dgun''. Yoshinobu accepted the plan in late 1867 and resigned, announcing an \"imperial restoration\". The Satsuma, Ch\u014dsh\u016b, and other ''han'' leaders and radical courtiers, however, [[rebellion|rebelled]], seized the [[Japanese imperial palace|imperial palace]], and announced their own restoration on January 3, 1868.\n\nFollowing the [[Boshin War]] (1868\u20131869), the ''bakufu'' was abolished, and Yoshinobu was reduced to the ranks of the common ''daimy\u014d''. Resistance continued in the North throughout 1868, and the ''bakufu'' [[navy|naval forces]] under Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki]] continued to hold out for another six months in [[Hokkaid\u014d]], where they founded the short-lived [[Republic of Ezo]].\n\n==Events==\n* 1600: [[Battle of Sekigahara]].

Mosby served on the Baltimore City Council from December 2011 to December 2016 passing major pieces of legislation like the most progressive form of [[Ban the Box]] in the country, addressing proliferation of liquor establishments in high crime and impoverished communities, and working to comprehensively evaluate outdated zoning designations. In January 2017, Mosby was appointed to serve as a member of the Maryland General Assembly in the [[Maryland House of Delegates]] representing Baltimore City's 40th District. He was equally successful as a Delegate passing legislation eliminating the draconian practice of selling liens of residents homes for unpaid water bills, developing tax credit programs to strengthen endowments of Maryland's [[Historically Black Colleges and Universities]], requiring the state to allow GED recipients access to over $83 million annual dollars in state higher education scholarships, and passing Ban the Box statewide. Prior to public service, Mosby worked as an electrical engineer managing large scale telecommunication system projects and building multi-million dollar state of the art video cloud storage and computing data centers.\n\nMosby is a 1997 graduate of the [[Baltimore Polytechnic Institute]] and has a [[bachelor of science]] degree in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Tuskegee University]].<ref name= aboutnick>{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130708110111/http://nickmosbyforcitycouncil.appspot.com/about.htm |archivedate= 8 July 2013 |url= https://nickmosbyforcitycouncil.appspot.com/about.htm |title= Vote Nick Mosby for Baltimore City Council 7th District |work= Nick Mosby For City Council |accessdate= 13 June 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bal-sun-candidates-nick-mosby-story.html |title=District 7: Nick Mosby |work= Baltimore Sun |date= 2011 |accessdate= 13 June 2015}}</ref> Mosby is a member of [[Omega Psi Phi]] fraternity, having been initiated at the Pi Omega Chapter in Baltimore.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://piomega.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=129066&module_id=77374 |title= Sons of Pi Omega |work= Pi Omega Chapter |publisher= Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc |accessdate= 28 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\n===Baltimore City Council===\nMosby defeated two-term incumbent Baltimore City Councilwoman Belinda K. Conaway by a double-digit margin.<ref>[http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/36loc/bcity/elect/general/bcit2007.html]</ref> This surprising political upset shocked the political establishment and received a lot of attention because it was the first time in almost thirty years where a political challenger beat a seated member of the Baltimore City Council. \n\nAs a Councilman, Mosby organized over 60 Enough is Enough marches, working with police and community groups to reduce crime and violence in West Baltimore. Seeing how poor health was harming his community, Mosby started the \"Get Fit with Councilman Mosby\" Challenge, partnering with close to 30 personal trainers, fitness organizations and chefs, the American Heart Association and Y of Central MD to provide free access to fitness and cooking classes.\n \nMosby has long fought for criminal justice reform. As Councilman, he developed and ran a mentoring program for juveniles awaiting trial as adults in the [[Baltimore City Detention Center]]. He introduced a law that was passed banning the requirement of criminal records on job applications, which enabled ex-offenders to have a fresh start. He also introduced a law that was passed stopping liquor stores from selling merchandise to children. Mosby arranged for the donation of school supplies for thousands of children, and organized free cultural enriching trips for thousands of children in West Baltimore.\n \nIn 2012, Mosby appeared on the reality show [[Kitchen Nightmares]], presenting [[Cafe Hon]] owner Denise Whiting a Baltimore City resolution.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjkRhvl5-Tk]</ref>\n\n====2015 Baltimore riots====\nDuring the [[2015 Baltimore protests]] following the [[death of Freddie Gray]], Mosby said that the unrest was \"unproductive\" but also the result of decades old of lack of investment and socio-economic decline.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/riots-seen-as-cry-for-help-from-city-youth-435506243585|title=Riots seen as 'cry for help' from Baltimore youth |publisher= MSNBC |accessdate= 13 June 2015 |work= The Rachel Maddow Show |date= 28 April 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/speedreads/552173/watch-baltimore-city-councilman-try-explain-roots-black-anger-fox-news|title=Watch a Baltimore city councilman try to explain the roots of black anger to Fox News|work= The Week |date= 28 April 2015 |first= Ryu |last= Spaeth |accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref> Mosby's unscripted comments in the middle of the street with protestors, burning buildings, and looters quickly went viral and garnered over two million views in a little over a day. During the interview Mosby also pointed out how the media was quick to call the incident a \"riot\" but consistently failed to do the same when compared to other incidents, like the 2015 riots in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], after the [[Kentucky Wildcats]] lost to the [[Wisconsin Badgers]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.lex18.com/story/28921033/baltimore-councilman-compares-riots-to-uk-basketball-fans-after-loss |title= Baltimore Councilman Compares Riots To UK Basketball Fans After Loss |date= 28 April 2015 |work= [[WLEX-TV]] |location= Lexington, Kentucky |publisher= NBC News Digital, Inc. |accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref> That interview would later be used by communication organizations and colleges as an example of staying on message despite surroundings and rapid fire questioning from reporters.

On November 8, 2016, Leon F. Pinkett won his vacated seat on the Council.<ref>[http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/36loc/bcity/leg/former/html/msa15836.html]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nA native son of Baltimore City, Mosby was raised by his mother. Being the only male in his household, he was surrounded by strong, hardworking women and learned early on the importance of good work ethic. Prioritization of education was instilled in Mosby, and he consistently balanced the perils of growing in Baltimore City with a goal of becoming the first in his family to go off to college. After graduating from college and leading a very successful professional career, Mosby focused his attention to rebuilding his community. He decided to purchase a home in West Baltimore that had been severely abandoned for decades and sat directly across the street from one of Baltimore's most violent housing complexes. The home was in such bad shape that he could stand on the first floor and see both the sky and the basement floor.

Mosby served on the Baltimore City Council from December 2011 to December 2016 passing major pieces of legislation like the most progressive form of [[Ban the Box]] in the country, addressing proliferation of liquor establishments in high crime and impoverished communities, and working to comprehensively evaluate outdated zoning designations. In January of 2017, Mosby was appointed to serve as a member of the Maryland General Assembly in the [[Maryland House of Delegates]] representing Baltimore City's 40th District. He was equally successful as a Delegate passing legislation eliminating the draconian practice of selling liens of residents homes for unpaid water bills, developing tax credit programs to strengthen endowments of Maryland's [[Historically Black Colleges and Universities]], requiring the state to allow GED recipients access to over $83 million annual dollars in state higher education scholarships, and passing Ban the Box statewide. Prior to public service, Mosby worked as an electrical engineer managing large scale telecommunication system projects and building multi-million dollar state of the art video cloud storage and computing data centers.\n\nMosby is a 1997 graduate of the [[Baltimore Polytechnic Institute]] and has a [[bachelor of science]] degree in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Tuskegee University]].<ref name= aboutnick>{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130708110111/http://nickmosbyforcitycouncil.appspot.com/about.htm |archivedate= 8 July 2013 |url= https://nickmosbyforcitycouncil.appspot.com/about.htm |title= Vote Nick Mosby for Baltimore City Council 7th District |work= Nick Mosby For City Council |accessdate= 13 June 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bal-sun-candidates-nick-mosby-story.html |title=District 7: Nick Mosby |work= Baltimore Sun |date= 2011 |accessdate= 13 June 2015}}</ref> Mosby is a member of [[Omega Psi Phi]] fraternity, having been initiated at the Pi Omega Chapter in Baltimore.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://piomega.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=129066&module_id=77374 |title= Sons of Pi Omega |work= Pi Omega Chapter |publisher= Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc |accessdate= 28 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\n===Baltimore City Council===\nMosby defeated two-term incumbent Baltimore City Councilwoman Belinda K. Conaway by a double-digit margin.<ref>[http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/36loc/bcity/elect/general/bcit2007.html]</ref> This surprising political upset shocked the political establishment and received a lot of attention because it was the first time in almost thirty years where a political challenger beat a seated member of the Baltimore City Council. \n\nAs a Councilman, Mosby organized over 60 Enough is Enough marches, working with police and community groups to reduce crime and violence in West Baltimore. Seeing how poor health was harming his community, Mosby started the \"Get Fit with Councilman Mosby\" Challenge, partnering with close to 30 personal trainers, fitness organizations and chefs, the American Heart Association and Y of Central MD to provide free access to fitness and cooking classes.\n \nMosby has long fought for criminal justice reform. As Councilman, he developed and ran a mentoring program for juveniles awaiting trial as adults in the [[Baltimore City Detention Center]]. He introduced a law that was passed banning the requirement of criminal records on job applications, which enabled ex-offenders to have a fresh start. He also introduced a law that was passed stopping liquor stores from selling merchandise to children. Mosby arranged for the donation of school supplies for thousands of children, and organized free cultural enriching trips for thousands of children in West Baltimore.\n \nIn 2012, Mosby appeared on the reality show [[Kitchen Nightmares]], presenting [[Cafe Hon]] owner Denise Whiting a Baltimore City resolution.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjkRhvl5-Tk]</ref>\n\n====2015 Baltimore riots====\nDuring the [[2015 Baltimore protests]] following the [[death of Freddie Gray]], Mosby said that the unrest was \"unproductive\" but also the result of decades old of lack of investment and socio-economic decline.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/riots-seen-as-cry-for-help-from-city-youth-435506243585|title=Riots seen as 'cry for help' from Baltimore youth |publisher= MSNBC |accessdate= 13 June 2015 |work= The Rachel Maddow Show |date= 28 April 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/speedreads/552173/watch-baltimore-city-councilman-try-explain-roots-black-anger-fox-news|title=Watch a Baltimore city councilman try to explain the roots of black anger to Fox News|work= The Week |date= 28 April 2015 |first= Ryu |last= Spaeth |accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref> Mosby's unscripted comments in the middle of the street with protestors, burning buildings, and looters quickly went viral and garnered over two million views in a little over a day. During the interview Mosby also pointed out how the media was quick to call the incident a \"riot\" but consistently failed to do the same when compared to other incidents, like the 2015 riots in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], after the [[Kentucky Wildcats]] lost to the [[Wisconsin Badgers]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.lex18.com/story/28921033/baltimore-councilman-compares-riots-to-uk-basketball-fans-after-loss |title= Baltimore Councilman Compares Riots To UK Basketball Fans After Loss |date= 28 April 2015 |work= [[WLEX-TV]] |location= Lexington, Kentucky |publisher= NBC News Digital, Inc. |accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref> That interview would later be used by communication organizations and colleges as an example of staying on message despite surroundings and rapid fire questioning from reporters.

On November 8, 2016, Leon F. Pinkett won his vacated seat on the Council.<ref>[http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/36loc/bcity/leg/former/html/msa15836.html]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nA native son of Baltimore City, Mosby was raised by his mother. Being the only male in his household, he was surrounded by strong, hardworking women and learned early on the importance of good work ethic. Prioritization of education was instilled in Mosby, and he consistently balanced the perils of growing in Baltimore City with a goal of becoming the first in his family to go off to college. After graduating from college and leading a very successful professional career, Mosby focused his attention to rebuilding his community. He decided to purchase a home in West Baltimore that had been severely abandoned for decades and sat directly across the street from one of Baltimore\u2019s most violent housing complexes. The home was in such bad shape that he could stand on the first floor and see both the sky and the basement floor. Undaunted, he rehabilitated the home and immediately became active in the neighborhood by becoming president of the community association. Mosby is married to [[Marilyn Mosby|Marilyn]] (n\u00e9e James), the [[state's attorney]] of [[Baltimore City]].
