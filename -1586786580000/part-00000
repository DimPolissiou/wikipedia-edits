Group analysis is a way of understanding group processes in small, median or, large groups. It is concerned with the relationship between a person and the network of activity in the many groups of which he or she might belong. Through these group processes we can explore what bearing the public and private aspects of a person\u2019s life have on one another, and the dialectic between group and [[personal development]]. Group members are supported, through shared experience and joint exploration within the group, in coming to a healthier understanding of their situation. Problems are seen at the level of group, organisation or institutional system; not solely in the individual sufferer, as they do in prevailing medical models. Problems within are recast as obstacles without. The way in which the group functions is central to this. Democracy and co-operation are the pillars through which group-mediated solutions to problems can flow in ways that are enduring. It is based on the principles developed by S.H.

It is an approach that views the group as an organic entity and insists that the therapist take a less intrusive role, so as to become the group's conductor (as in music) rather than its director. The group is seen as not merely a dynamic entity of its own, but functions within a [[Social environment|sociocultural context]] that influences its processes. In group analytic technique, the therapist weans the members from excessive and inappropriate dependency towards becoming their own therapists \u2013 both to themselves and to the other group members.\n\nThe [[Group Analytic Society]] and the [[Institute of Group Analysis]] were organisations established by Foulkes and others to promote Group Analysis and to train practitioners.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Group psychotherapy]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=August 2007}}\n\n'''Group analysis''' (or '''group analytic psychotherapy''') is a method of [[group psychotherapy]] originated by [[S.
