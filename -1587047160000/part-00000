An area of great diversity, it is mostly split into the [[Dark Peak]], where most of the [[moorland]] is found and the geology is [[gritstone]], and the [[limestone]] area of the [[White Peak]].\n\nThe Peak District National Park became the first [[National parks of England and Wales|national park]] in the United Kingdom in 1951.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/79227/factsheet4-quarrying.pdf |title=Quarrying and mineral extraction in the Peak District National Park |publisher=Peak District National Park Authority |year=2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127055057/http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/79227/factsheet4-quarrying.pdf |archivedate=27 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> With its proximity to the cities of [[Manchester]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Derby]] and [[Sheffield]], and access by road and rail, it attracts millions of visitors every year.<ref>{{cite book |title=Britain |last=Wheeler |first=T. |editor-last=Else |editor-first=D |year=2003 |edition=5th |isbn=1-74059-338-3 |page=42 |quote=The Peak District alone gets 20 million, making it Britain's most-visited park, and the second-busiest in the world. |publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/learning-about/news/mediacentrefacts |title=Media Centre Facts and Figures |publisher=Peak District National Park Authority |accessdate=4 March 2014}}</ref> It is estimated that 20&nbsp;million people live within one hour's journey of the Peak District.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/learning-about/news/mediacentrefacts|title=Media Centre Facts and Figures|website=Peak District National Park}}</ref>\n\nInhabited from the [[Mesolithic]] era, evidence exists from the [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s. Settled by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]] and [[Anglo-Saxons]], the area remained largely agricultural and mining grew in importance in the medieval era. [[Richard Arkwright]] built his [[cotton mill]]s at the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Quarrying became important as mining declined. Tourism grew after the advent of the railways, visitors attracted by the landscape, [[spa town]]s at [[Buxton]] and [[Matlock Bath]], [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]]'s show caves, and [[Bakewell]], the national park's only town.\n\nTourism remains important for its towns and villages and their varied attractions, [[country house]]s and heritage sites.

Ulihatu was the birthplace of Sugana Munda, father of Birsa. The claim of Ulihatu rests on Birsa's elder brother Komta Munda living in the village, where his house still exists albeit in a dilapidated condition.\n\nBirsa's father, mother Karmi Hatu,<ref name=stamp>[http://www.indianpost.com/viewstamp.php/Alpha/B/BIRSA%20MUNDA Birsa Mumda commemorative postage stamp and biography][[India Post]], 15 November 1988.</ref> and younger brother, Pasna Munda, left Ulihatu and proceeded to Kurumbda, near Birbanki, in search of employment as labourers (sajhedari) or crop-sharers (ryots). At Kurmbda, Birsa's elder brother, Komta, and his sister, Daskir, were born. From there the family moved to Bamba where Birsa's elder sister Champa was born followed by Birsa himself.\n\nBirsa's early years were spent with his parents at Chalakkad.\nHis early life could not have been very different from that of an average Munda child. Folklore refers to his rolling and playing in sand and dust with his friends, and his growing up strong and handsome in looks; he grazed sheep in the forest of Bohonda. When he grew up, he shared an interest in playing the flute, in which he became expert. He went round with the tuila, the one-stringed instrument made from the pumpkin, in the hand and the flute strung to his waist. Exciting moments of his childhood were spent on the [[akhara]] (the village wrestling ground). One of his ideal contemporaries and who went out with him, however, heard him speak of strange things.\n\nDriven by poverty Birsa was taken to Ayubhatu, his maternal uncle's village.<ref name=neeraj>{{cite book|last=Neeraj|title=Birsa Munda|publisher=Ocean Books P Ltd 4/19 Asif Ali Road|location=New Delhi-110 002|isbn=9788188322930|pages=3\u201310|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hZLBO_lOsnsC&pg=PA3&dq=birsa+munda#v=onepage&q=birsa%20munda&f=false|date=January 2009}}</ref> Komta Munda, his eldest brother, who was ten years of age, went to Kundi Bartoli, entered the service of a Munda, married and lived there for eight years, and then joined his father and younger brother at Chalkad. At Ayubhatu Birsa lived for two years. He went to school at Salga, run by one Jaipal Nag. He accompanied his mother's younger sister, Joni, who was fond of him, when she was married, to Khatanga, her new home. He came in contact with a Christian missionary who visited a few families in the village which had been converted to Christianity and attacked the old Munda order.\n\nAs he was sharp in studies, Jaipal Nag recommended him to join German Mission School but, converting to Christianity was compulsory to join the school and Birsa thus converted to Christianity and was renamed as Birsa David, which later became as Birsa Daud.<ref name=neeraj/> After studying for few years, he left German Mission School.\n\n== Formative period (1886\u20131894)==\nBirsa's long stay at Chaibasa from 1886 to 1890 constituted a formative period of his life. This period was marked by the German and Roman Catholic Christian agitation. In light of freedom struggle, Sugana Munda withdrew his son from the school. Soon after leaving Chaibasa in 1890 Birsa and his family gave up their membership of the German mission and ceased to be Christian and reverted to his original traditional tribal religious system.\n\nHe left Corbera in the wake of the mounting Sardar agitation. He participated in the agitation stemming from popular disaffection at the restrictions imposed upon the traditional rights of the Mundas in the protected forest, under the leadership of Gidiun of Piring in the Porhat area. During 1893\u201394 all waste lands in villages, the ownership of which was vested in the Government, were constituted into protected forests under the Indian Forest Act VII of 1882. In Singhbhum as in Palamau and Manbhum the forest settlement operations were launched and measures were taken to determine the rights of the forest-dwelling communities. Villages in forests were marked off in blocks of convenient size consisting not only of village sites but also cultivable and wastelands sufficient of the needs of villages. In 1894, Birsa had grown up into a strong young man, shrewd and intelligent and undertook the work of repairing the Dombari tank at Gorbera damaged by rains.\n\nWhile on a sojourn in the neighbourhood of village Sankara in Singhbhum, he found suitable companion, presented her parents with jewels and explained to her his idea of marriage. Later, on his return from jail he did not find her faithful to him and left her. Another woman who served him at Chalkad was the sister of Mathias Munda. On his release from prison, the daughter of Mathura Muda of Koensar who was kept by Kali Munda, and the wife of Jaga Munda of Jiuri insisted on becoming wives of Birsa. He rebuked them and referred the wife of Jaga Munda to her husband. Another rather well-known woman who stayed with Birsa was Sali of Burudih.\n\nBirsa stressed monogamy at a later stage in his life. Birsa rose from the lowest ranks of the peasants, the ryots, who unlike their namesakes elsewhere enjoyed far fewer rights in the Mundari khuntkatti system; while all privileges were monopolized by the members of the founding lineage, the ryots were no better than crop-sharers. Birsa's own experience as a young boy, driven from place to place in search of employment, given him an insight into the agrarian question and forest matters; he was no passive spectator but an active participant in the movement going on in the neighbourhood.\n\n== New religion ==\nBirsa's claim to be a messenger of God and the founder of a new religion sounded preposterous to the missionaries. There were also within his sect converts from Christianity, mostly Sardars. His simple system of offering was directed against the church which levied a tax. The concept of one God appealed to his people who found his religion and economical religion healer, a miracle-worker, and a preacher spread. The Mundas, [[Oraons]], and [[Kharia people|Kharias]] flocked to Chalkad to see the new prophet and to be cured of their ills. Both the Oraon and Munda population up to [[Barwari]] and Chechari in Palamau became convinced Birsaities. Contemporary and later folk songs commemorate the tremendous impact of Birsa on his people, their joy and expectations at his advent. The name of ''Dharti Aba'' was on everybody's lips. A folk song in [[Sadri language|Sadani]] showed that the first impact cut across the lines of caste Hindus and Muslims also flocked to the new Sun of religion.\n\nBirsa Munda started to advise tribal people to pursue their original traditional tribal religious system.<ref name=neeraj/> Impressed by his teachings, he became a prophet figure to the tribal people and they sought his blessings.<ref name=neeraj/>\n\n==Tribal movement==\n[[File:Birsa Munda Statue at Naya More.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Birsa Munda statue by [[Nabhendu Sen]] at ''Naya More'', [[Bokaro Steel City]], [[Jharkhand]]]]\nBirsa Munda's slogan threatening the British Raj\u2014''Abua raj seter jana, maharani raj tundu jana'' (\"Let the kingdom of the queen be ended and our kingdom be established\")\u2014is remembered today in areas of [[Odisha]], [[Bihar]], [[West Bengal]], and [[Madhya Pradesh]].<ref name=stamp/>\n\nThe [[British colonial system]] intensified the transformation of the tribal [[agrarian system]] into a feudal state. As the tribals with their primitive technology could not generate a surplus, non-tribal peasantry were invited by the chiefs in [[Chhotanagpur]] to settle on and cultivate the land. This led to the alienation of the lands held by the tribals. The new class of Thikadars was of a more rapacious kind and eager to make the most of their possessions.\n\nIn 1856 [[Jagir|Jagirs]] stood at about 600, and they held from a village to 150 villages. But by 1874, the authority of the old Munda or Oraon chiefs had been almost entirely annulled by that of the farmers, introduced by the landlords. In some villages they had completely lost their proprietary rights, and had been reduced to the position of farm labourers.\n\nTo the twin challenges of agrarian breakdown and culture change, Birsa along with the Munda responded through a series of revolts and uprisings under his leadership. In 1895, in Chalakkad village of [[Tamar block|Tamar]], Birsa Munda renounced Christianity, asked his fellow tribesmen to worship only one God and give up worship of bongas. He advised people to follow the path of purity, austerity and prohibited cow- slaughters.\n  \nHe declared himself a prophet who had come to recover the lost kingdom of his people. He said that the reign of the Queen Victoria was over and the Munda Raj had begun. He gave orders to the ''[[wikt:raiyats|raiyats]]'' (tenant farmers) to pay no rents. The mundas called him ''Dharati Aba'', the father of earth.\n\nDue to a rumor that those who didn't follow Birsa would be massacred, Birsa was arrested and sentenced to two-year imprisonment. On 28 January 1898, after being released from jail he went with his followers to Chutia to collect the record and to re-establish racial links with the temple. He said that the temple belonged to the [[Kols]]. The Christian missionaries wanted to arrest Birsa and his followers, who were threatening their ability to make converts. Birsa went underground for two years but attending a series of secret meetings. During this period he visited the [[Jagannath Temple, Ranchi|Jagarnath temple]].\n\nIt is said that around 7000 men and women assembled around Christmas of 1899, to herald the ''ulgulaan'' (revolution) which soon spread to Khunti, Tamar, Basia, and Ranchi. The Anglican Mission at Murhu and the Roman Catholic Mission at Sarwada were the main targets. The Birsaits openly declared that the real enemies were the British and not Christian Mundas and called for a decisive war against the British. For two years, they attacked places loyal to the British.\n\nOn 5 January 1900, Birsa's followers killed two constables at Etkedih. On 7 January, they attacked Khunti Police station, killed a constable, and razed the houses of local shopkeepers. The commissioner, A. Fobes, and deputy commissioner, H.C. Streattfield, rushed to Khunti with an army of 150 to crush the rebellion. The British administration set a reward of Rs 500 for Birsa. The British forces attacked Munda guerillas at Dumbari Hill, indiscriminately firing on and killing hundreds of people. Birsa escaped to the hills of Singhbhum.\n\nHe was arrested at  Jamkopai  forest in [[Chakradharpur]] on 3 March 1900. According to Deputy commissioner Ranchi, vide letter, 460 tribals were made accused in 15 different criminal cases, out of which 63 were convicted. One was sentenced to death, 39  to transportation for life and 23 to imprisoned for terms up to fourteen years. There were six death, including that of Birsa Munda in the prison during trials.

Ulihatu was the birthplace of Sugana Munda, father of Birsa. The claim of Ulihatu rests on Birsa's elder brother Komta Munda living in the village, where his house still exists albeit in a dilapidated condition.\n\nBirsa's father, mother Karmi Hatu,<ref name=stamp>[http://www.indianpost.com/viewstamp.php/Alpha/B/BIRSA%20MUNDA Birsa Mumda commemorative postage stamp and biography][[India Post]], 15 November 1988.</ref> and younger brother, Pasna Munda, left Ulihatu and proceeded to Kurumbda, near Birbanki, in search of employment as labourers (sajhedari) or crop-sharers (ryots). At Kurmbda, Birsa's elder brother, Komta, and his sister, Daskir, were born. From there the family moved to Bamba where Birsa's elder sister Champa was born followed by Birsa himself.\n\nBirsa's early years were spent with his parents at Chalakkad.\nHis early life could not have been very different from that of an average Munda child. Folklore refers to his rolling and playing in sand and dust with his friends, and his growing up strong and handsome in looks; he grazed sheep in the forest of Bohonda. When he grew up, he shared an interest in playing the flute, in which he became expert. He went round with the tuila, the one-stringed instrument made from the pumpkin, in the hand and the flute strung to his waist. Exciting moments of his childhood were spent on the [[akhara]] (the village wrestling ground). One of his ideal contemporaries and who went out with him, however, heard him speak of strange things.\n\nDriven by poverty Birsa was taken to Ayubhatu, his maternal uncle's village.<ref name=neeraj>{{cite book|last=Neeraj|title=Birsa Munda|publisher=Ocean Books P Ltd 4/19 Asif Ali Road|location=New Delhi-110 002|isbn=9788188322930|pages=3\u201310|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hZLBO_lOsnsC&pg=PA3&dq=birsa+munda#v=onepage&q=birsa%20munda&f=false|date=January 2009}}</ref> Komta Munda, his eldest brother, who was ten years of age, went to Kundi Bartoli, entered the service of a Munda, married and lived there for eight years, and then joined his father and younger brother at Chalkad. At Ayubhatu Birsa lived for two years. He went to school at Salga, run by one Jaipal Nag. He accompanied his mother's younger sister, Joni, who was fond of him, when she was married, to Khatanga, her new home. He came in contact with a Christian missionary who visited a few families in the village which had been converted to Christianity and attacked the old Munda order.\n\nAs he was sharp in studies, Jaipal Nag recommended him to join German Mission School but, converting to Christianity was compulsory to join the school and Birsa thus converted to Christianity and was renamed as Birsa David, which later became as Birsa Daud.<ref name=neeraj/> After studying for few years, he left German Mission School.\n\n== Formative period (1886\u20131894)==\nBirsa's long stay at Chaibasa from 1886 to 1890 constituted a formative period of his life. This period was marked by the German and Roman Catholic Christian agitation. In light of freedom struggle, Sugana Munda withdrew his son from the school. Soon after leaving Chaibasa in 1890 Birsa and his family gave up their membership of the German mission and ceased to be Christian and reverted to his original traditional tribal religious system.\n\nHe left Corbera in the wake of the mounting Sardar agitation. He participated in the agitation stemming from popular disaffection at the restrictions imposed upon the traditional rights of the Mundas in the protected forest, under the leadership of Gidiun of Piring in the Porhat area. During 1893\u201394 all waste lands in villages, the ownership of which was vested in the Government, were constituted into protected forests under the Indian Forest Act VII of 1882. In Singhbhum as in Palamau and Manbhum the forest settlement operations were launched and measures were taken to determine the rights of the forest-dwelling communities. Villages in forests were marked off in blocks of convenient size consisting not only of village sites but also cultivable and wastelands sufficient of the needs of villages. In 1894, Birsa had grown up into a strong young man, shrewd and intelligent and undertook the work of repairing the Dombari tank at Gorbera damaged by rains.\n\nWhile on a sojourn in the neighbourhood of village Sankara in Singhbhum, he found suitable companion, presented her parents with jewels and explained to her his idea of marriage. Later, on his return from jail he did not find her faithful to him and left her. Another woman who served him at Chalkad was the sister of Mathias Munda. On his release from prison, the daughter of Mathura Muda of Koensar who was kept by Kali Munda, and the wife of Jaga Munda of Jiuri insisted on becoming wives of Birsa. He rebuked them and referred the wife of Jaga Munda to her husband. Another rather well-known woman who stayed with Birsa was Sali of Burudih.\n\nBirsa stressed monogamy at a later stage in his life. Birsa rose from the lowest ranks of the peasants, the ryots, who unlike their namesakes elsewhere enjoyed far fewer rights in the Mundari khuntkatti system; while all privileges were monopolized by the members of the founding lineage, the ryots were no better than crop-sharers. Birsa's own experience as a young boy, driven from place to place in search of employment, given him an insight into the agrarian question and forest matters; he was no passive spectator but an active participant in the movement going on in the neighbourhood.\n\n== New religion ==\nBirsa's claim to be a messenger of God and the founder of a new religion sounded preposterous to the missionaries. There were also within his sect converts from Christianity, mostly Sardars. His simple system of offering was directed against the church which levied a tax. The concept of one God appealed to his people who found his religion and economical religion healer, a miracle-worker, and a preacher spread. The Mundas, [[Oraons]], and [[Kharia people|Kharias]] flocked to Chalkad to see the new prophet and to be cured of their ills. Both the Oraon and Munda population up to [[Barwari]] and Chechari in Palamau became convinced Birsaities. Contemporary and later folk songs commemorate the tremendous impact of Birsa on his people, their joy and expectations at his advent. The name of ''Dharti Aba'' was on everybody's lips. A folk song in [[Sadri language|Sadani]] showed that the first impact cut across the lines of caste Hindus and Muslims also flocked to the new Sun of religion.\n\nBirsa Munda started to advise tribal people to pursue their original traditional tribal religious system.<ref name=neeraj/> Impressed by his teachings, he became a prophet figure to the tribal people and they sought his blessings.<ref name=neeraj/>\n\n==Tribal movement==\n[[File:Birsa Munda Statue at Naya More.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Birsa Munda statue by [[Nabhendu Sen]] at ''Naya More'', [[Bokaro Steel City]], [[Jharkhand]]]]\nBirsa Munda's slogan threatening the British Raj\u2014''Abua raj seter jana, maharani raj tundu jana'' (\"Let the kingdom of the queen be ended and our kingdom be established\")\u2014is remembered today in areas of [[Odisha]], [[Bihar]], [[West Bengal]], and [[Madhya Pradesh]].<ref name=stamp/>\n\nThe [[British colonial system]] intensified the transformation of the tribal [[agrarian system]] into a feudal state. As the tribals with their primitive technology could not generate a surplus, non-tribal peasantry were invited by the chiefs in [[Chhotanagpur]] to settle on and cultivate the land. This led to the alienation of the lands held by the tribals. The new class of Thikadars was of a more rapacious kind and eager to make the most of their possessions.\n\nIn 1856 [[Jagir|Jagirs]] stood at about 600, and they held from a village to 150 villages. But by 1874, the authority of the old Munda or Oraon chiefs had been almost entirely annulled by that of the farmers, introduced by the landlords. In some villages they had completely lost their proprietary rights, and had been reduced to the position of farm labourers.\n\nTo the twin challenges of agrarian breakdown and culture change, Birsa along with the Munda responded through a series of revolts and uprisings under his leadership. In 1895, in Chalakkad village of [[Tamar block|Tamar]], Birsa Munda renounced Christianity, asked his fellow tribesmen to worship only one God and give up worship of bongas. He advised people to follow the path of purity, austerity and prohibited cow- slaughters.\n  \nHe declared himself a prophet who had come to recover the lost kingdom of his people. He said that the reign of the Queen Victoria was over and the Munda Raj had begun. He gave orders to the ''[[wikt:raiyats|raiyats]]'' (tenant farmers) to pay no rents. The mundas called him ''Dharati Aba'', the father of earth.\n\nDue to a rumor that those who didn't follow Birsa would be massacred, Birsa was arrested and sentenced to two-year imprisonment. On 28 January 1898, after being released from jail he went with his followers to Chutia to collect the record and to re-establish racial links with the temple. He said that the temple belonged to the [[Kols]]. The Christian missionaries wanted to arrest Birsa and his followers, who were threatening their ability to make converts. Birsa went underground for two years but attending a series of secret meetings. During this period he visited the [[Jagannath Temple, Ranchi|Jagarnath temple]].\n\nIt is said that around 7000 men and women assembled around Christmas of 1899, to herald the ''ulgulaan'' (revolution) which soon spread to Khunti, Tamar, Basia, and Ranchi. The Anglican Mission at Murhu and the Roman Catholic Mission at Sarwada were the main targets. The Birsaits openly declared that the real enemies were the British and not Christian Mundas and called for a decisive war against the British. For two years, they attacked places loyal to the British.\n\nOn 5 January 1900, Birsa's followers killed two constables at Etkedih. On 7 January, they attacked Khunti Police station, killed a constable, and razed the houses of local shopkeepers. The commissioner, A. Fobes, and deputy commissioner, H.C. Streattfield, rushed to Khunti with an army of 150 to crush the rebellion. The British administration set a reward of Rs 500 for Birsa. The British forces attacked Munda guerillas at Dumbari Hill, indiscriminately firing on and killing hundreds of people. Birsa escaped to the hills of Singhbhum.\n\nHe was arrested at  Jamkopai  forest in [[Chakradharpur]] on 3 March 1900. According to Deputy commissioner Ranchi, vide letter, 460 tribals were made accused in 15 different criminal cases, out of which 63 were convicted.

The founding [[Patriarchy|patriarch]] of Macondo, Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda, and \u00darsula Iguar\u00e1n, his wife (and first cousin), leave [[Riohacha]], [[Colombia]], after Jos\u00e9 Arcadio kills Prudencio Aguilar after a [[cockfight]] for suggesting Jos\u00e9 Arcadio was [[Erectile dysfunction|impotent]]. One night of their emigration journey, while camping on a riverbank, Jos\u00e9 Arcadio dreams of \"Macondo\", a city of mirrors that reflected the world in and about it. Upon awakening, he decides to establish Macondo at the riverside; after days of wandering the jungle, his founding of Macondo is [[Utopia|utopic]].<ref name=\"Bell\"/>\n\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda believes Macondo to be surrounded by water, and from that island, he invents the world according to ''his'' perceptions.<ref name=\"Bell\"/> Soon after its foundation, Macondo becomes a town frequented by unusual and extraordinary events that involve the generations of the Buend\u00eda family, who are unable or unwilling to escape their periodic (mostly self-inflicted) misfortunes. For years the town is solitary and unconnected to the outside world, with the exception of the annual visit of a band of gypsies, who show the townspeople technology such as [[Magnet|magnets]], [[Telescope|telescopes]], and ice. The leader of the gypsies, a man named Melqu\u00edades, maintains a close friendship with Jos\u00e9 Arcadio, who becomes increasingly withdrawn, obsessed with investigating the mysteries of the universe presented to him by the gypsies. Ultimately he is driven insane, speaking only in [[Latin-language|Latin]], and is tied to a chestnut tree by his family for many years until his death. \n\nEventually Macondo becomes exposed to the outside world and the government of newly independent Colombia. A rigged election between the [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservative]] and [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberal]] parties is held in town, inspiring Aureliano Buend\u00eda to join a civil war against the Conservative government. He becomes an iconic revolutionary leader, fighting for many years and surviving multiple attempts on his life, but ultimately tires of war and signs a peace treaty with the Conservatives. Disillusioned, he returns to Macondo and spends the rest of his life making tiny gold fish in his workshop.\n\nThe railroad comes to Macondo, bringing in new technology and many foreign settlers. An American fruit company constructs a banana plantation outside the town and builds its own segregated village across the river. This ushers in a period of prosperity that ends in tragedy as the Colombian army massacres thousands of striking plantation workers, an incident based on the [[Banana Massacre]] of 1928. Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Segundo, the only survivor of the massacre, finds no evidence of the massacre and the surviving townspeople refuse to believe it happened. \n\nBy the novel's end, Macondo has fallen into a decrepit and near-abandoned state, with the only remaining Buend\u00edas being Amaranta \u00darsula and her nephew Aureliano. Aureliano's parentage is hidden by his grandmother Fernanda, and he and Amaranta \u00darsula unknowingly begin an incestuous relationship. They have a child who bears the tail of a pig, fulfilling the lifelong fear of the long-dead matriarch \u00darsula. Amaranta \u00darsula dies in childbirth and the child is devoured by ants, leaving Aureliano as the last member of the family. He decodes an encryption Melqu\u00edades left behind in a manuscript generations ago. The secret message informs the recipient of every fortune and misfortune the Buend\u00eda family's generations lived through. As he reads the manuscript, a wind destroys all traces of Macondo's existence.<ref name=\"Wood\"/>\n\n==Symbolism and metaphors==\nA dominant theme in ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is the inevitable and inescapable repetition of history in Macondo. The protagonists are controlled by their pasts and the complexity of time. Throughout the novel the characters are visited by ghosts. \"The ghosts are symbols of the past and the haunting nature it has over Macondo. The ghosts and the displaced repetition that they evoke are, in fact, firmly grounded in the particular development of Latin American history\".<ref name=\"Erickson\">{{cite book |title=Ghosts, Metaphor, and History in Toni Morrison's Beloved and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's One Hundred Years off Solitude |last=Erickson |first=Daniel |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=Macmillan |location= |isbn=978-0-230-61348-5 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> \"Ideological transfiguration ensured that Macondo and the Buend\u00edas always were ghosts to some extent, alienated and estranged from their own history, not only victims of the harsh reality of dependence and underdevelopment but also of the ideological illusions that haunt and reinforce such social conditions.\"<ref name=\"Erickson\"/>\n\nThe fate of Macondo is both doomed and predetermined from its very existence. \"Fatalism is a metaphor for the particular part that ideology has played in maintaining historical dependence, by locking the interpretation of Latin American history into certain patterns that deny alternative possibilities. The narrative seemingly confirms fatalism in order to illustrate the feeling of entrapment that ideology can performatively create.\"<ref name=\"Erickson\"/>\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez uses colours as symbols. Yellow and gold are the most frequently used and symbolize imperialism and the Spanish [[Siglo de Oro]]. Gold signifies a search for economic wealth, whereas yellow represents death, change, and destruction.<ref>Some Implications of Yellow and Gold in Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\": Color Symbolism, Onomastics, and Anti-Idyll\" by John Carson Pettey Citation Revista Hisp\u00e1nica Moderna, A\u00f1o 53, No. 1 pp. 162\u2013178 Year 2000</ref>\n\nThe glass city is an image that comes to Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda in a dream. It is the reason for Macondo's location, but also a symbol of its fate. Higgins writes, \"By the final page, however, the city of mirrors has become a city of mirages. Macondo thus represents the dream of a brave new world that America seemed to promise and that was cruelly proved illusory by the subsequent course of history.\"<ref name=\"Bell\"/> Images such as the glass city and the ice factory represent how Latin America already has its history outlined and is therefore fated for destruction.<ref name=\"Erickson\"/>\n\nThere is an underlying pattern of Latin American history in ''One Hundred Years of Solitude''. It has been said that the novel is one of a number of texts that \"Latin American culture has created to understand itself.\"<ref name=\"Gonzalez Echevarria p. 358-80\">\"Cien a\u00f1os de soledad: the novel as myth and archive\" by Gonzalez Echevarria. p. 358-80 Year 1984</ref> In this sense, the novel can be conceived as a linear archive that narrates the story of a Latin America discovered by European explorers, which had its historical entity developed by the printing press. The Archive is a symbol of the literature that is the foundation of Latin American history and also a decoding instrument. Melqu\u00edades, the keeper of the archive, represents both the whimsical and the literary.<ref name=\"Gonzalez Echevarria p. 358-80\"/>  Finally, \"the world of ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is a place where beliefs and metaphors become forms of fact, and where more ordinary facts become uncertain.\"<ref name=\"Wood\"/>\n\nThe use of particular historic events and characters renders ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' an exemplary work of [[magical realism]], wherein the novel compresses centuries of cause and effect whilst telling an interesting story.<ref name=\"McMurray, George 1969 pp. 175-181\"/>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===First generation===\n;'''Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda'''\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda is the [[patriarch]] of the Buend\u00eda family and the founder of Macondo.<ref name=\"Gordo\">Gordo-Guarinos, Francisco. ''Cien a\u00f1os de soledad.'' Barcelona: Editorial Vosgos, S.A., 1977.</ref> Buend\u00eda leaves [[Riohacha]], Colombia, along with his wife \u00darsula Iguar\u00e1n after being haunted by the corpse of Prudencio Aguilar (a man Buend\u00eda killed in a duel), who constantly bleeds from his wound and tries to wash it.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> One night while camping at the side of a river, Buend\u00eda dreams of a city of mirrors named Macondo and decides to establish the town in this location. Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda is an introspective and inquisitive man of massive strength and energy who spends more time on his scientific pursuits than with his family. He flirts with alchemy and astronomy and becomes increasingly withdrawn from his family and community.\n\n;'''\u00darsula Iguar\u00e1n'''\n\u00darsula Iguar\u00e1n is one of the two matriarchs of the Buend\u00eda family and is wife to Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> She lives to be well over 100 years old and she oversees the Buend\u00eda household through six of the seven generations documented in the novel. She exhibits a very strong character and often succeeds where the men of her family fail, for example finding a route to the outside world from Macondo.\n\n===Second generation===\n;'''Jos\u00e9 Arcadio'''\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda's firstborn son, Jos\u00e9 Arcadio seems to have inherited his father's headstrong, impulsive mannerisms.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> He eventually leaves the family to chase a Gypsy girl and unexpectedly returns many years later as an enormous man covered in tattoos, claiming that he's sailed the seas of the world. He marries his adopted sister Rebeca, causing his banishment from the mansion, and he dies from a mysterious gunshot wound, days after saving his brother from execution.\n\n;'''Colonel Aureliano Buend\u00eda'''\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda's second son and the first person to be born in Macondo.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> He was thought to have premonitions because everything he said came true.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> He represents not only a warrior figure but also an artist due to his ability to write poetry and create finely crafted golden fish. During the wars he fathered 17 sons by unknown women,<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> all named Aureliano. Four of them later begin to live in Macondo, and in the span of several weeks all of them but one (including those who chose not to remain in Macondo) are murdered by unknown assassins, before any of them had reached thirty-five years of age.\n\n;'''Remedios Moscote'''\nRemedios was the youngest daughter of the town's Conservative administrator, Don Apolinar Moscote.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> Her most striking physical features are her beautiful skin and her emerald-green eyes. The future Colonel Aureliano falls in love with her, despite her extreme youth. She dies shortly after the marriage from a blood poisoning illness during her pregnancy. Until soon before the Colonel's death, her dolls are displayed in his bedroom.\n\n;'''Amaranta'''\nThe third child of Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda, Amaranta grows up as a companion of her adopted sister Rebeca.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> However, her feelings toward Rebeca turn sour over Pietro Crespi, whom both sisters intensely desire in their teenage years. Amaranta dies a lonely and virginal [[spinster]], but comfortable in her existence after having finally accepted what she had become.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>\n\n;'''Rebeca'''\nRebeca is the second cousin of \u00darsula Iguaran and the orphaned child of Nicanor Ulloa and his wife Rebeca Montiel.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> At first she is extremely timid, refuses to speak, and has the habits of eating earth and whitewash from the walls of the house, a condition known as [[pica (disorder)|pica]]. She arrives carrying a canvas bag containing her parents' bones and seems not to understand or speak Spanish. However, she responds to questions asked by Visitaci\u00f3n and Cataure in the Guajiro or [[Wayuu language]]. She falls in love with and marries her adoptive brother Jos\u00e9 Arcadio after his return from traveling the world. After his mysterious and untimely death, she lives in seclusion for the rest of her life.\n\n===Third generation===\n;'''Arcadio'''\nArcadio is Jos\u00e9 Arcadio's illegitimate son by Pilar Ternera.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> He is a schoolteacher who assumes leadership of Macondo after Colonel Aureliano Buend\u00eda leaves.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>  He becomes a tyrannical dictator and uses his schoolchildren as his personal army and  Macondo soon becomes subject to his whims. When the Liberal forces in Macondo fall, Arcadio is shot by a Conservative firing squad.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>\n\n;'''Aureliano Jos\u00e9'''\nAureliano Jos\u00e9 is the illegitimate son of Colonel Aureliano Buend\u00eda and Pilar Ternera.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> He joins his father in several wars before deserting to return to Macondo upon hearing that it is possible to marry one's aunt.  Aureliano Jos\u00e9 is obsessed with his aunt, Amaranta, who raised him since birth and who categorically rejects his advances. He is eventually  shot to death by a Conservative captain midway through the wars.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>\n\n;'''Santa Sof\u00eda de la Piedad'''\nSanta Sof\u00eda is a beautiful virgin girl and the daughter of a shopkeeper.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>  She is hired by Pilar Ternera to have sex with her son Arcadio, her eventual husband.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>  She is taken in along with her children by the Buend\u00edas after Arcadio's execution. After \u00darsula's death she leaves unexpectedly, not knowing her destination.\n\n;'''17 Aurelianos'''\nDuring his 32 civil war campaigns, Colonel Aureliano Buend\u00eda has 17 sons by 17 different women, each named after their father.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>  Four of these Aurelianos (A. Triste, A. Serrador, A. Arcaya and A. Centeno) stay in Macondo and become a permanent part of the family.  Eventually, as revenge against the Colonel, all are assassinated by the government, which identified them by the mysteriously permanent [[Ash Wednesday]] cross on their foreheads. The only survivor of the massacre is A. Amador, who escapes into the jungle only to be assassinated at the doorstep of his father's house many years later.\n\n===Fourth generation===\n{{anchor|Remedios-the-Beauty}}'''Remedios the Beauty'''<br />\nRemedios the Beauty is Arcadio and Santa Sof\u00eda's first child.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> It is said she is the most beautiful woman ever seen in Macondo, and unintentionally causes the deaths of several men who love or lust over her.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> She appears to most of the town as naively innocent, and some come to think that she is mentally delayed. However, Colonel Aureliano Buend\u00eda believes she has inherited great lucidity: \"It is as if she's come back from twenty years of war,\" he said. She rejects clothing and beauty. Too beautiful and, arguably, too wise for the world, Remedios ascends into the sky one afternoon, while folding Fernanda's white sheet.\n\n;'''Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Segundo'''\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio Segundo is the twin brother of Aureliano Segundo, the children of Arcadio and Santa Sof\u00eda.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> \u00darsula believes that the two were switched in their childhood, as Jos\u00e9 Arcadio begins to show the characteristics of the family's Aurelianos, growing up to be pensive and quiet. He plays a major role in the banana worker strike, and is the only survivor when the company massacres the striking workers.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>  Afterward, he spends the rest of his days studying the parchments of Melqu\u00edades, and tutoring the young Aureliano. He dies at the exact instant that his twin does.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>\n\n;'''Aureliano Segundo'''\nOf the two brothers, Aureliano Segundo is the more boisterous and impulsive, much like the Jos\u00e9 Arcadios of the family.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> He takes his first girlfriend Petra Cotes as his mistress during his marriage to the beautiful and bitter Fernanda del Carpio.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> When living with Petra, his livestock propagate wildly, and he indulges in unrestrained revelry. After the long rains, his fortune dries up, and the Buend\u00edas are left almost penniless. He turns to a search for a buried treasure, which nearly drives him to insanity. He dies of an unknown throat illness at the same moment as his twin. During the confusion at the funeral, the bodies are switched, and each is buried in the other's grave (highlighting \u00darsula's earlier comment that they had been switched at birth).\n\n{{anchor|Fernanda-del-Carpio}}'''Fernanda del Carpio'''<br />\nFernanda comes from a ruined, aristocratic family that kept her isolated from the world.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> She was chosen as the most beautiful of 5,000 girls. Fernanda is brought to Macondo to compete with Remedios for the title of Queen of the local carnival; however, her appearance turns the carnival into a bloody confrontation. After the fiasco, she marries Aureliano Segundo, who despite this maintains a domestic relation with his concubine, Petra Cotes. Nevertheless, she soon takes the leadership of the family away from the now-frail \u00darsula. She manages the Buend\u00eda affairs with an iron fist. She has three children by Aureliano Segundo: Jos\u00e9 Arcadio; Renata Remedios, a.k.a. Meme; and Amaranta \u00darsula. She remains in the house after her husband dies, taking care of the household until her death.\n\nFernanda is never accepted by anyone in the Buend\u00eda household for they regard her as an outsider, although none of the Buend\u00edas rebel against her inflexible conservatism. Her mental and emotional instability is revealed through her paranoia, her correspondence with the \"[[Psychic surgery|invisible doctors]],\u201d and her irrational behavior towards Meme's son Aureliano, whom she tries to isolate from the whole world.\n\n===Fifth generation===\n;'''Renata Remedios (a.k.a. Meme)'''\nRenata Remedios, or Meme is the second child and first daughter of Fernanda and Aureliano Segundo.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> While she doesn't inherit Fernanda's beauty, she does have Aureliano Segundo's love of life and natural charisma. After her mother declares that she is to do nothing but play the [[clavichord]], she is sent to school where she receives her performance degree as well as academic recognition.  While she pursues the clavichord with \u201can inflexible discipline,\u201d to placate Fernanda, she also enjoys partying and exhibits the same tendency towards excess as her father.\n\nMeme meets and falls in love with Mauricio Babilonia, but when Fernanda discovers their affair, she arranges for Mauricio to be shot, claiming that he was a chicken thief. She then takes Meme to a convent. Meme remains mute for the rest of her life, partially because of the trauma, but also as a sign of rebellion. Several months after arriving at the convent, she gives birth to a son, Aureliano. He is sent to live with the Buend\u00edas. Aureliano arrives in a basket and Fernanda is tempted to kill the child in order to avoid shame, but instead claims he is an orphan in order to cover up her daughter's promiscuity and is forced to \"tolerate him against her will for the rest of her life because at the moment of truth she lacked the courage to go through with her inner determination to drown him\". \n\n;'''Jos\u00e9 Arcadio'''\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio, named after his ancestors in the Buend\u00eda tradition, follows the trend of previous Arcadios.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> He is raised by \u00darsula, who intends for him to become Pope. He returns from Rome without having become a priest. He spends his days pining for Amaranta, the object of his obsession. Eventually, he discovers the treasure \u00darsula had buried under her bed, which he wastes on lavish parties and escapades with adolescent boys. Later, he begins a tentative friendship with Aureliano Babilonia, his nephew. Jos\u00e9 Arcadio plans to set Aureliano up in a business and return to Rome, but is murdered in his bath by four of the adolescent boys who ransack his house and steal his gold.\n\n;'''Amaranta \u00darsula'''\nAmaranta \u00darsula is the third child of Fernanda and Aureliano.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> She displays the same characteristics as her namesake who dies when she is only a child.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> She never knows that the child sent to the Buend\u00eda home is her nephew, the illegitimate son of Meme. He becomes her best friend in childhood. She returns home from Europe with an older husband, Gast\u00f3n, who leaves her when she informs him of her passionate affair with Aureliano. She dies of a [[hemorrhage]] after she has given birth to the last of the Buend\u00eda line.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>\n\n===Sixth generation===\n;'''Aureliano Babilonia (Aureliano II)'''\nAureliano Babilonia, or Aureliano II, is the illegitimate child of Meme. He is hidden from everyone by his grandmother, Fernanda.  He is strikingly similar to his namesake, the Colonel, and has the same character patterns as well.  He is taciturn, silent, and emotionally charged. He barely knows \u00darsula, who dies during his childhood. He is a friend of Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Segundo, who explains to him the true story of the banana worker massacre.\n\nWhile other members of the family leave and return, Aureliano stays in the Buend\u00eda home. He only ventures into the empty town after the death of Fernanda. He works to decipher the parchments of Melqu\u00edades but stops to have an affair with his childhood partner and the love of his life, Amaranta \u00darsula, not knowing that she is his aunt.  When both she and her child die, he is able to decipher the parchments. \"...Melqu\u00edades' final keys were revealed to him and he saw the epigraph of the parchments perfectly placed in the order of man's time and space: 'The first in line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by ants'.\" It is assumed he dies in the great wind that destroys Macondo the moment he finishes reading Melqu\u00edades' parchments.\n\n===Seventh generation===\n;'''Aureliano'''\nAureliano is the child of Aureliano and his aunt, Amaranta \u00darsula.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> He is born with a pig's tail, as the eldest and long dead \u00darsula had always feared would happen (the parents of the child had never heard of the omen).<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> His mother dies after giving birth to him, and, due to his grief-stricken father's negligence, he is devoured by ants.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>\n\n===Others===\n;'''Melqu\u00edades'''\nMelqu\u00edades is one of a band of gypsies who visit Macondo every year in March, displaying amazing items from around the world.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> Melqu\u00edades sells Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda several new inventions including a pair of [[magnets]] and an [[alchemy|alchemist]]'s lab. Later, the gypsies report that Melqu\u00edades died in [[Singapore]], but he, nonetheless, returns to live with the Buend\u00eda family,<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> stating he could not bear the solitude of death. He stays with the Buend\u00edas and begins to write the mysterious parchments, which are eventually translated by Aureliano Babilonia, and prophesy the House of Buendia's end. Melqu\u00edades dies a second time from drowning in the river near Macondo and, following a grand ceremony organized by the Buend\u00edas, is the first individual buried in Macondo. His name echoes [[Melchizedek]] in the Old Testament, whose source of authority as a high priest was mysterious.  \n\n;'''Pilar Ternera'''\nPilar is a local woman who sleeps with the brothers Aureliano and Jos\u00e9 Arcadio.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> She becomes the mother of their sons, Aureliano Jos\u00e9 and Arcadio.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> Pilar reads the future with cards, and every so often makes an accurate, though vague, prediction.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> She has close ties with the Buendias throughout the whole novel, helping them with her card predictions. She dies some time after she turns 145 years old (she had eventually stopped counting),<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> surviving until the very last days of Macondo.\n\nShe plays an integral part in the plot as she is the link between the second and the third generation of the Buendia family. The author highlights her importance by following her death with a declaratory \"it was the end.\"<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>\n\n;'''Pietro Crespi'''\nPietro is a very handsome and polite Italian musician who runs a music school.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>  He installs the [[pianola]] in the Buend\u00eda house.  He becomes engaged to Rebeca, but Amaranta, who also loves him, manages to delay the wedding for years. When Jos\u00e9 Arcadio and Rebeca agree to be married, Pietro begins to woo Amaranta, who is so embittered that she cruelly rejects him. Despondent over the loss of both sisters, he kills himself.\n\n;'''Petra Cotes'''\nPetra is a dark-skinned woman with gold-brown eyes similar to those of a panther. She is Aureliano Segundo's mistress and the love of his life. She arrives in Macondo as a teenager with her first husband. After her husband dies, she begins a relationship with Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Segundo. When she meets Aureliano Segundo, she begins a relationship with him as well, not knowing they are two different men. After Jos\u00e9 Arcadio decides to leave her, Aureliano Segundo gets her forgiveness and remains by her side. He continues to see her, even after his marriage.  He eventually lives with her, which greatly embitters his wife, Fernanda del Carpio. When Aureliano and Petra make love, their animals reproduce at an amazing rate, but their livestock is wiped out during the four years of rain.  Petra makes money by keeping the lottery alive and provides food baskets for Fernanda and her family after the death of Aureliano Segundo.\n\n;'''Mr. Herbert''' and '''Mr. Brown'''\nMr. Herbert is a [[gringo]] who showed up at the Buend\u00eda house for lunch one day. After tasting the local bananas for the first time, he arranges for a banana company to set up a plantation in Macondo.  The plantation is run by the dictatorial Jack Brown. When Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Segundo helps arrange a workers' strike on the plantation, the company traps the more than three thousand strikers and machine guns them down in the town square. The banana company and the government completely cover up the event. Jos\u00e9 Arcadio is the only one who remembers the slaughter. The company arranges for the army to kill off any resistance, then leaves Macondo for good. That event is likely based on the [[Banana massacre]], that took place in [[Ci\u00e9naga, Magdalena]] in 1928.\n\n;'''Mauricio Babilonia'''\nMauricio is a brutally honest, generous and handsome mechanic for the banana company.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>  He is said to be a descendant of the gypsies who visit Macondo in the early days.  He has the unusual characteristic of being constantly swarmed by yellow butterflies, which follow even his lover for a time.  Mauricio begins a romantic affair with Meme until Fernanda discovers them and tries to end it. When Mauricio continues to sneak into the house to see her, Fernanda has him shot, claiming he is a chicken thief. Paralyzed and bedridden, he spends the rest of his long life in solitude.\n\n;'''Gast\u00f3n'''\nGast\u00f3n is Amaranta \u00darsula's wealthy, Belgian husband. She marries him in Europe and returns to Macondo leading him on a silk leash. Gast\u00f3n is about fifteen years older than his wife. He is an aviator and an adventurer. When he moves with Amaranta Ursula to Macondo he thinks it is only a matter of time before she realizes that her European ways are out of place, causing her to want to move back to Europe. However, when he realizes his wife intends to stay in Macondo, he arranges for his airplane to be shipped over so he can start an airmail service. The plane is shipped to Africa by mistake. When he travels there to claim it, Amaranta writes him of her love for Aureliano Babilonia Buend\u00eda. Gast\u00f3n takes the news in stride, only asking that they ship him his [[velocipede]].\n\n;'''Colonel Gerineldo Marquez'''\nHe is the friend and comrade-in-arms of Colonel Aureliano Buendia.  He fruitlessly woos Amaranta.\n\n;'''Gabriel Garcia M\u00e1rquez'''\nGabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez is only a minor character in the novel but he has the distinction of bearing the same name as the author. He is the great-great-grandson of Colonel Gerineldo M\u00e1rquez. He and Aureliano Babilonia are close friends because they know the history of the town, which no one else believes. He leaves for Paris after winning a contest and decides to stay there, selling old newspapers and empty bottles.  He is one of the few who is able to leave Macondo before the town is wiped out entirely.\n\n==Major themes==\n{{rquote|right|The rise and fall, birth and death of the mythical but intensely real Macondo, and the glories and disasters of the wonderful Buend\u00eda family; make up an intensely brilliant chronicle of humankind's [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] and [[Tragedy|tragedies]]. All the many varieties of life are captured here: inventively, amusingly, magnetically, sadly, humorously, luminously, truthfully.<ref name = \"PSinsights\" />}}\n\n===Subjectivity of reality and magic realism===\nCritics often cite certain works by Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, such as ''[[A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings]]'' and ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'', as exemplary of [[magic realism]], a style of writing in which the supernatural is presented as mundane, and the mundane as supernatural or extraordinary. The term was coined by German art critic [[Franz Roh]] in 1925.<ref>Franz Roh: Nach-Expressionismus. Magischer Realismus. Probleme der neuesten europ\u00e4ischen Malerei. Klinkhardt & Biermann, Leipzig 1925.</ref>\n\nThe novel presents a fictional story in a fictional setting. The extraordinary events and characters are fabricated. However, the message that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez intends to deliver explains a true history. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez uses his fantastic story as an expression of reality. \"In ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' myth and history overlap. The myth acts as a vehicle to transmit history to the reader. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's novel can furthermore be referred to as anthropology, where truth is found in language and myth. What is real and what is fiction are indistinguishable. There are three main mythical elements of the novel: classical stories alluding to foundations and origins, characters resembling mythical heroes, and supernatural elements.\"<ref name=\"Gonzalez Echevarria p. 358-80\"/>\n[[Magic realism]] is inherent in the novel\u2014achieved by the constant intertwining of the ordinary with the extraordinary. This magic realism strikes at one's traditional sense of naturalistic fiction. There is something clearly magical about the world of Macondo.  It is a state of mind as much as, or more than, a geographical place.  For example, one learns very little about its actual physical layout. Furthermore, once in it, the reader must be prepared to meet whatever the imagination of the author presents to him or her.<ref>[http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/introser/marquez.HTM Ian Johnston (March 28, 1995) \"On Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude\"], Malaspina University College (now Vancouver Island University), Canada</ref>\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez blends the real with the magical through the use of tone and narration. By maintaining the same tone throughout the novel, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez makes the extraordinary blend with the ordinary. His condensation of and lackadaisical manner in describing events causes the extraordinary to seem less remarkable than it actually is, thereby perfectly blending the real with the magical.<ref>Gullon, Ricardo. \"Review: Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez & the Lost Art of Storytelling\". ''Diacritics'', Vol. 1, No. 1 (Autumn, 1971), pp. 27\u201332.</ref>   Reinforcing this effect is the unastonished tone in which the book is written. This tone restricts the ability of the reader to question the events of the novel. However, it also causes the reader to call into question the limits of reality.<ref name=\"Wood\"/>  Furthermore, maintaining the same narrator throughout the novel familiarizes the reader with his voice and causes him or her to become accustomed to the extraordinary events in the novel.<ref name=\"Wood\"/>\n\n===Fluidity of time===\n''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' contains several ideas concerning time. Although the story can be read as a linear progression of events, both when considering individual lives and Macondo's history, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez allows room for several other interpretations of time:\n* He reiterates the metaphor of history as a circular phenomenon through the repetition of names and characteristics belonging to the Buend\u00eda family.<ref>One Hundred Years of Solitude, Encyclopedia Beta.</ref> Over six generations, all the Jos\u00e9 Arcadios possess inquisitive and rational dispositions as well as enormous physical strength.  The Aurelianos, meanwhile, lean towards insularity and quietude. This repetition of traits reproduces the history of the individual characters and, ultimately, a history of the town as a succession of the same mistakes [[ad infinitum]] due to some endogenous [[hubris]] in our nature.\n* The novel explores the issue of timelessness or eternity even within the framework of mortal existence. A major [[Trope (literature)|trope]] with which it accomplishes this task is the alchemist's laboratory in the Buend\u00eda family home.  The laboratory was first designed by Melqu\u00edades near the start of the story and remains essentially unchanged throughout its course.  It is a place where the male Buend\u00eda characters can indulge their will to solitude, whether through attempts to deconstruct the world with reason as in the case of Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda, or by the endless creation and destruction of golden fish as in the case of his son Colonel Aureliano Buend\u00eda. Furthermore, a sense of inevitability prevails throughout the text.  This is a feeling that regardless of what way one looks at time, its encompassing nature is the one truthful admission.\n* On the other hand, it is important to keep in mind that ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'', while basically chronological and \"linear\" enough in its broad outlines, also shows abundant zigzags in time, both flashbacks of matters past and long leaps towards future events. One example of this is the youthful amour between Meme and Mauricio Babilonia, which is already in full swing before we are informed about the origins of the affair.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>\n\n===Incest===\nA recurring theme in ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is the Buend\u00eda family's propensity toward [[incest]].  The patriarch of the family, Jose Arcadio Buend\u00eda, is the first of numerous Buend\u00edas to intermarry when he marries his first cousin, \u00darsula. Furthermore, the fact that \"throughout the novel the family is haunted by the fear of punishment in the form of the birth of a monstrous child with a pig's tail\"<ref name=\"Bell\"/> can be attributed to this initial act and the recurring acts of incest among the Buend\u00edas.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>\n\n===Elitism===\nA theme throughout ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is the [[elitism]] of the Buend\u00eda family. Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez shows his criticism of the Latin American elite through the stories of the members a high-status family who are essentially in love with themselves, to the point of being unable to understand the mistakes of their past and learn from them.<ref name=\":0\">Elsey, Brenda. \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude.\u201d History of Latin America 1810-Present.

Macondo was founded in the remote jungles of the Colombian rainforest.  The solitude of the town is representative of the colonial period in Latin American history, where outposts and colonies were, for all intents and purposes, not interconnected.<ref name=\"Bell\"/> Isolated from the rest of the world, the Buend\u00edas grow to be increasingly solitary and selfish.  With every member of the family living only for him or her self, the Buend\u00edas become representative of the aristocratic, land-owning elite who came to dominate Latin America in keeping with the sense of Latin American history symbolized in the novel.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>  This egocentricity is embodied, especially, in the characters of Aureliano, who lives in a private world of his own, and Remedios the Beauty, who innocently destroys the lives of four men enamored by her unbelievable beauty, because she is living in a different reality due to what some see as autism. <ref name=\"Bell\"/>  Throughout the novel it seems as if no character can find true love or escape the destructiveness of their own egocentricity.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>\n\nThe selfishness of the Buend\u00eda family is eventually broken by the once superficial Aureliano Segundo and Petra Cotes, who discover a sense of mutual solidarity and the joy of helping others in need during Macondo's economic crisis.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>  The pair even find love, and their pattern is repeated by Aureliano Babilonia and Amaranta \u00darsula.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>  Eventually, Aureliano and Amaranta \u00darsula have a child, and the latter is convinced that it will represent a fresh start for the once-conceited Buend\u00eda family.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>  However, the child turns out to be the perpetually feared monster with the pig's tail.\n\nNonetheless, the appearance of love represents a shift in Macondo, albeit one that leads to its destruction.  \"The emergence of love in the novel to displace the traditional egoism of the Buend\u00edas reflects the emergence of socialist values as a political force in Latin America, a force that will sweep away the Buend\u00edas and the order they represent.\"<ref name=\"Bell\"/>  The ending to ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' could be a wishful prediction by Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, a well-known socialist, regarding the future of Latin America.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>\n\n==Interpretation==\n{{rquote|right|''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' works on so many levels, from childlike fantasy to exploration of the grief or happiness that solitude can bring, that it can be re-read without any reduction in enjoyment \u2013 in fact, each reading brings a wealth of forgotten or previously unnoticed details to the reader, wrapped in a lightness of style that gives this novel a charisma that assures its appeal.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A662997 ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' by Gabriel Garcia Marquez] by [[BBC]], January 1, 2004</ref>}}\n\nThroughout the novel, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez is said to have a gift for blending the everyday with the miraculous, the historical with the fabulous, and psychological realism with surreal flights of fancy. It is a revolutionary novel that provides a looking glass into the thoughts and beliefs of its author, who chose to give a literary voice to Latin America: \"A Latin America which neither wants, nor has any reason, to be a pawn without a will of its own; nor is it merely wishful thinking that its quest for independence and originality should become a Western aspiration.\"<ref>''The Dialectics of our America: Genealogy, Cultural Critique, and Literary History Post-Contemporary Interventions'', by Jos\u00e9 David Sald\u00edvar, Duke University Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-8223-1169-0}}, pg. 21</ref>\n\nAlthough we are faced with a very convoluted narrative, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez is able to define clear themes while maintaining individual character identities, and using different narrative techniques such as [[third-person narrator]]s, specific point of view narrators, and [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|streams of consciousness]].  Cinematographic techniques are also employed in the novel, with the idea of the [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] and the [[close-up]], which effectively combine the comic and grotesque with the dramatic and tragic. Furthermore, political and historical realities are combined with the mythical and magical Latin American world. Lastly, through human comedy the problems of a family, a town, and a country are unveiled.  This is all presented through Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's unique form of narration, which causes the novel to never cease being at its most interesting point.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe characters in the novel are never defined; they are not created from a mold.

The novel topped the list of books that have most shaped world literature over the last 25 years, according to a survey of international writers commissioned by the global literary journal ''[[Wasafiri]]'' as a part of its 25<small>th</small>-anniversary celebration.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wasafiri.org/pages/news_01/news_item.asp?News_01ID=182 |title=\"25 acclaimed international writers choose 25 of the best books from the last 25 years\" (September 25, 2009) ''Wasafiri Magazine'' |access-date=October 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005175839/http://www.wasafiri.org/pages/news_01/news_item.asp?News_01ID=182 |archive-date=October 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe superlatives from reviewers and readers alike display the resounding praise which the novel has received. [[Chilean people|Chilean]] poet and [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Laureate]] [[Pablo Neruda]] called it \"the greatest revelation in the Spanish language since ''[[Don Quixote]]'' of [[Cervantes]]\", while [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"with a single bound, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez leaps onto the stage with [[G\u00fcnter Grass]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]].\"<ref name = \"PSinsights\" />\n\nAccording to Antonio Sacoto, professor at the [[City College of the City University of New York]], ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is considered as one of the five key novels in Hispanic American literature (together with ''[[El Se\u00f1or Presidente]]'', ''[[Pedro P\u00e1ramo]]'', ''[[The Death of Artemio Cruz|La Muerte de Artemio Cruz]]'', and ''[[La ciudad y los perros]]''). These novels, representative of the boom allowed Hispanic American literature to reach the quality of North American and European literature in terms of technical quality, rich themes, and linguistic innovations, among other attributes.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Antonio Sacoto (1979) ''Cinco novelas claves de la novela hispano americana'' (''[[El se\u00f1or presidente]]'', ''[[Pedro P\u00e1ramo]]'',  ''[[La muerte de Artemio Cruz]]'', ''[[La ciudad y los perros]]'', ''Cien a\u00f1os de soledad''), Eliseo Torres & Sons, New York</ref>\n\nIn his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez addressed the significance of his writing and proposed its role to be more than just literary expression:\n\n{{quote|I dare to think that it is this outsized reality, and not just its literary expression, that has deserved the attention of the Swedish Academy of Letters. A reality not of paper, but one that lives within us and determines each instant of our countless daily deaths, and that nourishes a source of insatiable creativity, full of sorrow and beauty, of which this roving and nostalgic Colombian is but one cipher more, singled out by fortune. Poets and beggars, musicians and prophets, warriors and scoundrels, all creatures of that unbridled reality, we have had to ask but little of imagination, for our crucial problem has been a lack of conventional means to render our lives believable. This, my friends, is the crux of our solitude.<ref>Marquez, Gabriel Garcia. Nobel Lecture, Hispanic Heritage in the Americas. Nobel Lecture, 8 December 1982</ref>}}\n\n==Critiques==\nAlthough ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' has come to be considered one of, if not the, most influential Latin American texts of all time, the novel and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez have both received occasional criticisms. Stylistically, [[Harold Bloom]] remarked that \"My primary impression, in the act of rereading ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'', is a kind of aesthetic battle fatigue, since every page is rammed full of life beyond the capacity of any single reader to absorb... There are no wasted sentences, no mere transitions, in this novel, and you must notice everything at the moment you read it.\"<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''Bloom's Critical Interpretations'': Edited and with an Introduction by Harold Bloom: \"Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude\". Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2003</ref> Additionally, [[David Haberly]] alleges that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez may have borrowed themes from several works, such as [[William Faulkner]]'s [[Yoknapatawpha County]], [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'', [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]]'s ''[[A Journal of the Plague Year]]'', and [[Chateaubriand]]'s ''[[Atala (novella)|Atala]]''. This, however, is not necessarily a negative criticism, as it involves the concept of [[intertextuality]].<ref>Haberly, David T. (1990) ''Bags of Bones: A Source for Cien A\u00f1os de Soledad'', The Johns Hopkins University Press</ref>\n\n==Internal references==\nIn the novel's account of the civil war and subsequent peace, there are numerous mentions of the pensions not arriving for the veterans, a reference to one of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's earlier works, ''El coronel no tiene quien le escriba''. In the novel's final chapter, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez refers to the novel ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cort\u00e1zar novel)|Hopscotch]]'' (Spanish: ''Rayuela'') by [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]] in the following line: \"...in the room that smelled of boiled cauliflower where Rocamadour was to die\" (p.&nbsp;412). Rocamadour is a fictional character in ''Hopscotch'' who indeed dies in the room described. He also refers to two other major works by Latin American writers in the novel: ''[[The Death of Artemio Cruz]]'' (Spanish: ''La Muerte de Artemio Cruz'') by Carlos Fuentes and ''[[Explosion in a Cathedral]]'' (Spanish: ''El siglo de las luces'') by [[Alejo Carpentier]].\n\n==Adaptations==\nWhile ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' has had a large effect on the literary world and is the author's best-selling and most translated work, there have been no movies produced of it as Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez  never agreed to sell the rights to produce such a film. On March 6, 2019, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's son Rodrigo Garc\u00eda Barcha, announced that [[Netflix]] was developing a series based upon the book with a set release in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eltiempo.com/cultura/cine-y-tv/netflix-hara-una-serie-de-la-novela-cien-anos-de-soledad-de-gabriel-garcia-marquez-334516 |date=March 6, 2019 |access-date=6 March 2019 |title='Cien a\u00f1os de soledad' se convertir\u00e1 en una serie de Netflix |last=Hoyos Vargas |first=Andr\u00e9s |website=El Tiempo |language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/07/netflix-to-adapt-one-hundred-years-of-solitude-by-gabriel-garcia-marquez</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/08/colombians-await-one-hundred-years-of-solitude-screen-adaptation-with-joy-and-fear</ref>\n\n[[Sh\u016bji Terayama|Shuji Terayama]]'s play ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' (\u767e\u5e74\u306e\u5b64\u72ec, originally performed by the [[Tenj\u014d Sajiki|Tenjo Sajiki]] theater troupe) and his film ''[[Farewell to the Ark]]'' (\u3055\u3089\u3070\u7bb1\u821f) are loose (and not officially authorized) adaptations of the novel by Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez transplanted into the realm of Japanese culture and history.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century|''Le Monde''{{'s}} 100 Books of the Century]]\n* [[List of best-selling books]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/15/reviews/marque-solitude.html \"Memory and Prophecy, Illusion and Reality Are Mixed and Made to Look the Same\"] by ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 8, 1970\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/12/gabriel-garcia-marquez-one-hundred-years-of-solitude-history |title=The Secret History of ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |author=Sally Soame |date=December 2015}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Britannica|429058}}\n\n=== Reading curriculum ===\n* [http://www.oprah.com/oprahsbookclub/Synopsis-of-One-Hundred-Years-of-Solitude Oprah's Book Club's Guide to ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'']\n* [http://edsitement.neh.gov/curriculum-unit/magical-realism-one-hundred-years-solitude-common-core Magical Realism in \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude\u201d]\n\n=== Lectures and recordings ===\n* [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1982/marquez-lecture.html \"The Solitude of Latin America\"], Nobel lecture by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, 8 December 1982\n* [http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/introser/marquez.HTM \"On Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude\"] \u2013 a lecture by Ian Johnston\n* {{cite web|author=Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Gabriel|title=Colombian writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez reading the first chapter of One Hundred Years of Solitude|url=http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/32972|language=Spanish}}\n\n{{Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:One Hundred Years Of Solitude}}\n[[Category:1967 novels]]\n[[Category:Family saga novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]\n[[Category:Colombian magic realism novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Colombia]]\n[[Category:Harper & Row books]]\n[[Category:Jonathan Cape books]]\n[[Category:Novels about sleep disorders]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Novel by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, magical realism novel}}\n{{Infobox book\n| name          = One Hundred Years of Solitude\n| title_orig    = Cien a\u00f1os de soledad\n| translator    = [[Gregory Rabassa]]\n| image         = Cien a\u00f1os de soledad (book cover, 1967).jpg\n| caption       = First edition\n| author        = [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]\n| illustrator   =\n| cover_artist  =\n| country       = Argentina<!--Do not change to Colombia.

The founding [[Patriarchy|patriarch]] of Macondo, Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda, and \u00darsula Iguar\u00e1n, his wife (and first cousin), leave [[Riohacha]], [[Colombia]], after Jos\u00e9 Arcadio kills Prudencio Aguilar after a [[cockfight]] for suggesting Jos\u00e9 Arcadio was [[Erectile dysfunction|impotent]]. One night of their emigration journey, while camping on a riverbank, Jos\u00e9 Arcadio dreams of \"Macondo\", a city of mirrors that reflected the world in and about it. Upon awakening, he decides to establish Macondo at the riverside; after days of wandering the jungle, his founding of Macondo is [[Utopia|utopic]].<ref name=\"Bell\"/>\n\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda believes Macondo to be surrounded by water, and from that island, he invents the world according to ''his'' perceptions.<ref name=\"Bell\"/> Soon after its foundation, Macondo becomes a town frequented by unusual and extraordinary events that involve the generations of the Buend\u00eda family, who are unable or unwilling to escape their periodic (mostly self-inflicted) misfortunes. For years the town is solitary and unconnected to the outside world, with the exception of the annual visit of a band of gypsies, who show the townspeople technology such as [[Magnet|magnets]], [[Telescope|telescopes]], and ice. The leader of the gypsies, a man named Melqu\u00edades, maintains a close friendship with Jos\u00e9 Arcadio, who becomes increasingly withdrawn, obsessed with investigating the mysteries of the universe presented to him by the gypsies. Ultimately he is driven insane, speaking only in [[Latin-language|Latin]], and is tied to a chestnut tree by his family for many years until his death. \n\nEventually Macondo becomes exposed to the outside world and the government of newly independent Colombia. A rigged election between the [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservative]] and [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberal]] parties is held in town, inspiring Aureliano Buend\u00eda to join a civil war against the Conservative government. He becomes an iconic revolutionary leader, fighting for many years and surviving multiple attempts on his life, but ultimately tires of war and signs a peace treaty with the Conservatives. Disillusioned, he returns to Macondo and spends the rest of his life making tiny gold fish in his workshop.\n\nThe railroad comes to Macondo, bringing in new technology and many foreign settlers. An American fruit company constructs a banana plantation outside the town and builds its own segregated village across the river. This ushers in a period of prosperity that ends in tragedy as the Colombian army massacres thousands of striking plantation workers, an incident based on the [[Banana Massacre]] of 1928. Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Segundo, the only survivor of the massacre, finds no evidence of the massacre and the surviving townspeople refuse to believe it happened. \n\nBy the novel's end, Macondo has fallen into a decrepit and near-abandoned state, with the only remaining Buend\u00edas being Amaranta \u00darsula and her nephew Aureliano. Aureliano's parentage is hidden by his grandmother Fernanda, and he and Amaranta \u00darsula unknowingly begin an incestuous relationship. They have a child who bears the tail of a pig, fulfilling the lifelong fear of the long-dead matriarch \u00darsula. Amaranta \u00darsula dies in childbirth and the child is devoured by ants, leaving Aureliano as the last member of the family. He decodes an encryption Melqu\u00edades left behind in a manuscript generations ago. The secret message informs the recipient of every fortune and misfortune the Buend\u00eda family's generations lived through. As he reads the manuscript, a wind destroys all traces of Macondo's existence.<ref name=\"Wood\"/>\n\n==Symbolism and metaphors==\nA dominant theme in ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is the inevitable and inescapable repetition of history in Macondo. The protagonists are controlled by their pasts and the complexity of time. Throughout the novel the characters are visited by ghosts. \"The ghosts are symbols of the past and the haunting nature it has over Macondo. The ghosts and the displaced repetition that they evoke are, in fact, firmly grounded in the particular development of Latin American history\".<ref name=\"Erickson\">{{cite book |title=Ghosts, Metaphor, and History in Toni Morrison's Beloved and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's One Hundred Years off Solitude |last=Erickson |first=Daniel |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=Macmillan |location= |isbn=978-0-230-61348-5 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> \"Ideological transfiguration ensured that Macondo and the Buend\u00edas always were ghosts to some extent, alienated and estranged from their own history, not only victims of the harsh reality of dependence and underdevelopment but also of the ideological illusions that haunt and reinforce such social conditions.\"<ref name=\"Erickson\"/>\n\nThe fate of Macondo is both doomed and predetermined from its very existence. \"Fatalism is a metaphor for the particular part that ideology has played in maintaining historical dependence, by locking the interpretation of Latin American history into certain patterns that deny alternative possibilities. The narrative seemingly confirms fatalism in order to illustrate the feeling of entrapment that ideology can performatively create.\"<ref name=\"Erickson\"/>\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez uses colours as symbols. Yellow and gold are the most frequently used and symbolize imperialism and the Spanish [[Siglo de Oro]]. Gold signifies a search for economic wealth, whereas yellow represents death, change, and destruction.<ref>Some Implications of Yellow and Gold in Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\": Color Symbolism, Onomastics, and Anti-Idyll\" by John Carson Pettey Citation Revista Hisp\u00e1nica Moderna, A\u00f1o 53, No. 1 pp. 162\u2013178 Year 2000</ref>\n\nThe glass city is an image that comes to Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda in a dream. It is the reason for Macondo's location, but also a symbol of its fate. Higgins writes, \"By the final page, however, the city of mirrors has become a city of mirages. Macondo thus represents the dream of a brave new world that America seemed to promise and that was cruelly proved illusory by the subsequent course of history.\"<ref name=\"Bell\"/> Images such as the glass city and the ice factory represent how Latin America already has its history outlined and is therefore fated for destruction.<ref name=\"Erickson\"/>\n\nThere is an underlying pattern of Latin American history in ''One Hundred Years of Solitude''. It has been said that the novel is one of a number of texts that \"Latin American culture has created to understand itself.\"<ref name=\"Gonzalez Echevarria p. 358-80\">\"Cien a\u00f1os de soledad: the novel as myth and archive\" by Gonzalez Echevarria. p. 358-80 Year 1984</ref> In this sense, the novel can be conceived as a linear archive that narrates the story of a Latin America discovered by European explorers, which had its historical entity developed by the printing press. The Archive is a symbol of the literature that is the foundation of Latin American history and also a decoding instrument. Melqu\u00edades, the keeper of the archive, represents both the whimsical and the literary.<ref name=\"Gonzalez Echevarria p. 358-80\"/>  Finally, \"the world of ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is a place where beliefs and metaphors become forms of fact, and where more ordinary facts become uncertain.\"<ref name=\"Wood\"/>\n\nThe use of particular historic events and characters renders ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' an exemplary work of [[magical realism]], wherein the novel compresses centuries of cause and effect whilst telling an interesting story.<ref name=\"McMurray, George 1969 pp. 175-181\"/>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===First generation===\n;'''Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda'''\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda is the [[patriarch]] of the Buend\u00eda family and the founder of Macondo.<ref name=\"Gordo\">Gordo-Guarinos, Francisco.

Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda is an introspective and inquisitive man of massive strength and energy who spends more time on his scientific pursuits than with his family. He flirts with alchemy and astronomy and becomes increasingly withdrawn from his family and community.\n\n;'''\u00darsula Iguar\u00e1n'''\n\u00darsula Iguar\u00e1n is one of the two matriarchs of the Buend\u00eda family and is wife to Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> She lives to be well over 100 years old and she oversees the Buend\u00eda household through six of the seven generations documented in the novel.

The future Colonel Aureliano falls in love with her, despite her extreme youth. She dies shortly after the marriage from a blood poisoning illness during her pregnancy. Until soon before the Colonel's death, her dolls are displayed in his bedroom.\n\n;'''Amaranta'''\nThe third child of Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda, Amaranta grows up as a companion of her adopted sister Rebeca.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> However, her feelings toward Rebeca turn sour over Pietro Crespi, whom both sisters intensely desire in their teenage years.

However, she responds to questions asked by Visitaci\u00f3n and Cataure in the Guajiro or [[Wayuu language]]. She falls in love with and marries her adoptive brother Jos\u00e9 Arcadio after his return from traveling the world.

Aureliano Jos\u00e9 is obsessed with his aunt, Amaranta, who raised him since birth and who categorically rejects his advances. He is eventually  shot to death by a Conservative captain midway through the wars.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>\n\n;'''Santa Sof\u00eda de la Piedad'''\nSanta Sof\u00eda is a beautiful virgin girl and the daughter of a shopkeeper.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>  She is hired by Pilar Ternera to have sex with her son Arcadio, her eventual husband.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>  She is taken in along with her children by the Buend\u00edas after Arcadio's execution. After \u00darsula's death she leaves unexpectedly, not knowing her destination.\n\n;'''17 Aurelianos'''\nDuring his 32 civil war campaigns, Colonel Aureliano Buend\u00eda has 17 sons by 17 different women, each named after their father.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>  Four of these Aurelianos (A. Triste, A. Serrador, A. Arcaya and A. Centeno) stay in Macondo and become a permanent part of the family.  Eventually, as revenge against the Colonel, all are assassinated by the government, which identified them by the mysteriously permanent [[Ash Wednesday]] cross on their foreheads. The only survivor of the massacre is A. Amador, who escapes into the jungle only to be assassinated at the doorstep of his father's house many years later.\n\n===Fourth generation===\n{{anchor|Remedios-the-Beauty}}'''Remedios the Beauty'''<br />\nRemedios the Beauty is Arcadio and Santa Sof\u00eda's first child.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> It is said she is the most beautiful woman ever seen in Macondo, and unintentionally causes the deaths of several men who love or lust over her.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> She appears to most of the town as naively innocent, and some come to think that she is mentally delayed. However, Colonel Aureliano Buend\u00eda believes she has inherited great lucidity: \"It is as if she's come back from twenty years of war,\" he said. She rejects clothing and beauty. Too beautiful and, arguably, too wise for the world, Remedios ascends into the sky one afternoon, while folding Fernanda's white sheet.\n\n;'''Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Segundo'''\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio Segundo is the twin brother of Aureliano Segundo, the children of Arcadio and Santa Sof\u00eda.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> \u00darsula believes that the two were switched in their childhood, as Jos\u00e9 Arcadio begins to show the characteristics of the family's Aurelianos, growing up to be pensive and quiet. He plays a major role in the banana worker strike, and is the only survivor when the company massacres the striking workers.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>  Afterward, he spends the rest of his days studying the parchments of Melqu\u00edades, and tutoring the young Aureliano. He dies at the exact instant that his twin does.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>\n\n;'''Aureliano Segundo'''\nOf the two brothers, Aureliano Segundo is the more boisterous and impulsive, much like the Jos\u00e9 Arcadios of the family.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> He takes his first girlfriend Petra Cotes as his mistress during his marriage to the beautiful and bitter Fernanda del Carpio.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> When living with Petra, his livestock propagate wildly, and he indulges in unrestrained revelry. After the long rains, his fortune dries up, and the Buend\u00edas are left almost penniless. He turns to a search for a buried treasure, which nearly drives him to insanity. He dies of an unknown throat illness at the same moment as his twin. During the confusion at the funeral, the bodies are switched, and each is buried in the other's grave (highlighting \u00darsula's earlier comment that they had been switched at birth).\n\n{{anchor|Fernanda-del-Carpio}}'''Fernanda del Carpio'''<br />\nFernanda comes from a ruined, aristocratic family that kept her isolated from the world.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> She was chosen as the most beautiful of 5,000 girls. Fernanda is brought to Macondo to compete with Remedios for the title of Queen of the local carnival; however, her appearance turns the carnival into a bloody confrontation. After the fiasco, she marries Aureliano Segundo, who despite this maintains a domestic relation with his concubine, Petra Cotes. Nevertheless, she soon takes the leadership of the family away from the now-frail \u00darsula. She manages the Buend\u00eda affairs with an iron fist. She has three children by Aureliano Segundo: Jos\u00e9 Arcadio; Renata Remedios, a.k.a. Meme; and Amaranta \u00darsula. She remains in the house after her husband dies, taking care of the household until her death.\n\nFernanda is never accepted by anyone in the Buend\u00eda household for they regard her as an outsider, although none of the Buend\u00edas rebel against her inflexible conservatism. Her mental and emotional instability is revealed through her paranoia, her correspondence with the \"[[Psychic surgery|invisible doctors]],\u201d and her irrational behavior towards Meme's son Aureliano, whom she tries to isolate from the whole world.\n\n===Fifth generation===\n;'''Renata Remedios (a.k.a. Meme)'''\nRenata Remedios, or Meme is the second child and first daughter of Fernanda and Aureliano Segundo.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> While she doesn't inherit Fernanda's beauty, she does have Aureliano Segundo's love of life and natural charisma. After her mother declares that she is to do nothing but play the [[clavichord]], she is sent to school where she receives her performance degree as well as academic recognition.  While she pursues the clavichord with \u201can inflexible discipline,\u201d to placate Fernanda, she also enjoys partying and exhibits the same tendency towards excess as her father.\n\nMeme meets and falls in love with Mauricio Babilonia, but when Fernanda discovers their affair, she arranges for Mauricio to be shot, claiming that he was a chicken thief. She then takes Meme to a convent. Meme remains mute for the rest of her life, partially because of the trauma, but also as a sign of rebellion. Several months after arriving at the convent, she gives birth to a son, Aureliano. He is sent to live with the Buend\u00edas. Aureliano arrives in a basket and Fernanda is tempted to kill the child in order to avoid shame, but instead claims he is an orphan in order to cover up her daughter's promiscuity and is forced to \"tolerate him against her will for the rest of her life because at the moment of truth she lacked the courage to go through with her inner determination to drown him\". \n\n;'''Jos\u00e9 Arcadio'''\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio, named after his ancestors in the Buend\u00eda tradition, follows the trend of previous Arcadios.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> He is raised by \u00darsula, who intends for him to become Pope. He returns from Rome without having become a priest. He spends his days pining for Amaranta, the object of his obsession. Eventually, he discovers the treasure \u00darsula had buried under her bed, which he wastes on lavish parties and escapades with adolescent boys. Later, he begins a tentative friendship with Aureliano Babilonia, his nephew. Jos\u00e9 Arcadio plans to set Aureliano up in a business and return to Rome, but is murdered in his bath by four of the adolescent boys who ransack his house and steal his gold.\n\n;'''Amaranta \u00darsula'''\nAmaranta \u00darsula is the third child of Fernanda and Aureliano.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> She displays the same characteristics as her namesake who dies when she is only a child.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> She never knows that the child sent to the Buend\u00eda home is her nephew, the illegitimate son of Meme. He becomes her best friend in childhood. She returns home from Europe with an older husband, Gast\u00f3n, who leaves her when she informs him of her passionate affair with Aureliano. She dies of a [[hemorrhage]] after she has given birth to the last of the Buend\u00eda line.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>\n\n===Sixth generation===\n;'''Aureliano Babilonia (Aureliano II)'''\nAureliano Babilonia, or Aureliano II, is the illegitimate child of Meme. He is hidden from everyone by his grandmother, Fernanda.  He is strikingly similar to his namesake, the Colonel, and has the same character patterns as well.  He is taciturn, silent, and emotionally charged. He barely knows \u00darsula, who dies during his childhood. He is a friend of Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Segundo, who explains to him the true story of the banana worker massacre.\n\nWhile other members of the family leave and return, Aureliano stays in the Buend\u00eda home. He only ventures into the empty town after the death of Fernanda. He works to decipher the parchments of Melqu\u00edades but stops to have an affair with his childhood partner and the love of his life, Amaranta \u00darsula, not knowing that she is his aunt.  When both she and her child die, he is able to decipher the parchments. \"...Melqu\u00edades' final keys were revealed to him and he saw the epigraph of the parchments perfectly placed in the order of man's time and space: 'The first in line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by ants'.\" It is assumed he dies in the great wind that destroys Macondo the moment he finishes reading Melqu\u00edades' parchments.\n\n===Seventh generation===\n;'''Aureliano'''\nAureliano is the child of Aureliano and his aunt, Amaranta \u00darsula.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> He is born with a pig's tail, as the eldest and long dead \u00darsula had always feared would happen (the parents of the child had never heard of the omen).<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> His mother dies after giving birth to him, and, due to his grief-stricken father's negligence, he is devoured by ants.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>\n\n===Others===\n;'''Melqu\u00edades'''\nMelqu\u00edades is one of a band of gypsies who visit Macondo every year in March, displaying amazing items from around the world.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> Melqu\u00edades sells Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda several new inventions including a pair of [[magnets]] and an [[alchemy|alchemist]]'s lab. Later, the gypsies report that Melqu\u00edades died in [[Singapore]], but he, nonetheless, returns to live with the Buend\u00eda family,<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> stating he could not bear the solitude of death. He stays with the Buend\u00edas and begins to write the mysterious parchments, which are eventually translated by Aureliano Babilonia, and prophesy the House of Buendia's end. Melqu\u00edades dies a second time from drowning in the river near Macondo and, following a grand ceremony organized by the Buend\u00edas, is the first individual buried in Macondo. His name echoes [[Melchizedek]] in the Old Testament, whose source of authority as a high priest was mysterious.  \n\n;'''Pilar Ternera'''\nPilar is a local woman who sleeps with the brothers Aureliano and Jos\u00e9 Arcadio.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> She becomes the mother of their sons, Aureliano Jos\u00e9 and Arcadio.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> Pilar reads the future with cards, and every so often makes an accurate, though vague, prediction.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> She has close ties with the Buendias throughout the whole novel, helping them with her card predictions. She dies some time after she turns 145 years old (she had eventually stopped counting),<ref name=\"Gordo\"/> surviving until the very last days of Macondo.\n\nShe plays an integral part in the plot as she is the link between the second and the third generation of the Buendia family. The author highlights her importance by following her death with a declaratory \"it was the end.\"<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>\n\n;'''Pietro Crespi'''\nPietro is a very handsome and polite Italian musician who runs a music school.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>  He installs the [[pianola]] in the Buend\u00eda house.  He becomes engaged to Rebeca, but Amaranta, who also loves him, manages to delay the wedding for years. When Jos\u00e9 Arcadio and Rebeca agree to be married, Pietro begins to woo Amaranta, who is so embittered that she cruelly rejects him. Despondent over the loss of both sisters, he kills himself.\n\n;'''Petra Cotes'''\nPetra is a dark-skinned woman with gold-brown eyes similar to those of a panther. She is Aureliano Segundo's mistress and the love of his life. She arrives in Macondo as a teenager with her first husband. After her husband dies, she begins a relationship with Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Segundo. When she meets Aureliano Segundo, she begins a relationship with him as well, not knowing they are two different men. After Jos\u00e9 Arcadio decides to leave her, Aureliano Segundo gets her forgiveness and remains by her side. He continues to see her, even after his marriage.  He eventually lives with her, which greatly embitters his wife, Fernanda del Carpio. When Aureliano and Petra make love, their animals reproduce at an amazing rate, but their livestock is wiped out during the four years of rain.  Petra makes money by keeping the lottery alive and provides food baskets for Fernanda and her family after the death of Aureliano Segundo.\n\n;'''Mr. Herbert''' and '''Mr. Brown'''\nMr. Herbert is a [[gringo]] who showed up at the Buend\u00eda house for lunch one day. After tasting the local bananas for the first time, he arranges for a banana company to set up a plantation in Macondo.  The plantation is run by the dictatorial Jack Brown. When Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Segundo helps arrange a workers' strike on the plantation, the company traps the more than three thousand strikers and machine guns them down in the town square. The banana company and the government completely cover up the event. Jos\u00e9 Arcadio is the only one who remembers the slaughter. The company arranges for the army to kill off any resistance, then leaves Macondo for good. That event is likely based on the [[Banana massacre]], that took place in [[Ci\u00e9naga, Magdalena]] in 1928.\n\n;'''Mauricio Babilonia'''\nMauricio is a brutally honest, generous and handsome mechanic for the banana company.<ref name=\"Gordo\"/>  He is said to be a descendant of the gypsies who visit Macondo in the early days.  He has the unusual characteristic of being constantly swarmed by yellow butterflies, which follow even his lover for a time.  Mauricio begins a romantic affair with Meme until Fernanda discovers them and tries to end it. When Mauricio continues to sneak into the house to see her, Fernanda has him shot, claiming he is a chicken thief. Paralyzed and bedridden, he spends the rest of his long life in solitude.\n\n;'''Gast\u00f3n'''\nGast\u00f3n is Amaranta \u00darsula's wealthy, Belgian husband. She marries him in Europe and returns to Macondo leading him on a silk leash. Gast\u00f3n is about fifteen years older than his wife. He is an aviator and an adventurer. When he moves with Amaranta Ursula to Macondo he thinks it is only a matter of time before she realizes that her European ways are out of place, causing her to want to move back to Europe. However, when he realizes his wife intends to stay in Macondo, he arranges for his airplane to be shipped over so he can start an airmail service. The plane is shipped to Africa by mistake. When he travels there to claim it, Amaranta writes him of her love for Aureliano Babilonia Buend\u00eda. Gast\u00f3n takes the news in stride, only asking that they ship him his [[velocipede]].\n\n;'''Colonel Gerineldo Marquez'''\nHe is the friend and comrade-in-arms of Colonel Aureliano Buendia.  He fruitlessly woos Amaranta.\n\n;'''Gabriel Garcia M\u00e1rquez'''\nGabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez is only a minor character in the novel but he has the distinction of bearing the same name as the author. He is the great-great-grandson of Colonel Gerineldo M\u00e1rquez. He and Aureliano Babilonia are close friends because they know the history of the town, which no one else believes. He leaves for Paris after winning a contest and decides to stay there, selling old newspapers and empty bottles.  He is one of the few who is able to leave Macondo before the town is wiped out entirely.\n\n==Major themes==\n{{rquote|right|The rise and fall, birth and death of the mythical but intensely real Macondo, and the glories and disasters of the wonderful Buend\u00eda family; make up an intensely brilliant chronicle of humankind's [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] and [[Tragedy|tragedies]]. All the many varieties of life are captured here: inventively, amusingly, magnetically, sadly, humorously, luminously, truthfully.<ref name = \"PSinsights\" />}}\n\n===Subjectivity of reality and magic realism===\nCritics often cite certain works by Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, such as ''[[A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings]]'' and ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'', as exemplary of [[magic realism]], a style of writing in which the supernatural is presented as mundane, and the mundane as supernatural or extraordinary. The term was coined by German art critic [[Franz Roh]] in 1925.<ref>Franz Roh: Nach-Expressionismus. Magischer Realismus. Probleme der neuesten europ\u00e4ischen Malerei. Klinkhardt & Biermann, Leipzig 1925.</ref>\n\nThe novel presents a fictional story in a fictional setting. The extraordinary events and characters are fabricated. However, the message that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez intends to deliver explains a true history. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez uses his fantastic story as an expression of reality. \"In ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' myth and history overlap. The myth acts as a vehicle to transmit history to the reader. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's novel can furthermore be referred to as anthropology, where truth is found in language and myth. What is real and what is fiction are indistinguishable. There are three main mythical elements of the novel: classical stories alluding to foundations and origins, characters resembling mythical heroes, and supernatural elements.\"<ref name=\"Gonzalez Echevarria p. 358-80\"/>\n[[Magic realism]] is inherent in the novel\u2014achieved by the constant intertwining of the ordinary with the extraordinary. This magic realism strikes at one's traditional sense of naturalistic fiction. There is something clearly magical about the world of Macondo.  It is a state of mind as much as, or more than, a geographical place.  For example, one learns very little about its actual physical layout. Furthermore, once in it, the reader must be prepared to meet whatever the imagination of the author presents to him or her.<ref>[http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/introser/marquez.HTM Ian Johnston (March 28, 1995) \"On Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude\"], Malaspina University College (now Vancouver Island University), Canada</ref>\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez blends the real with the magical through the use of tone and narration. By maintaining the same tone throughout the novel, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez makes the extraordinary blend with the ordinary. His condensation of and lackadaisical manner in describing events causes the extraordinary to seem less remarkable than it actually is, thereby perfectly blending the real with the magical.<ref>Gullon, Ricardo. \"Review: Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez & the Lost Art of Storytelling\". ''Diacritics'', Vol. 1, No. 1 (Autumn, 1971), pp. 27\u201332.</ref>   Reinforcing this effect is the unastonished tone in which the book is written. This tone restricts the ability of the reader to question the events of the novel. However, it also causes the reader to call into question the limits of reality.<ref name=\"Wood\"/>  Furthermore, maintaining the same narrator throughout the novel familiarizes the reader with his voice and causes him or her to become accustomed to the extraordinary events in the novel.<ref name=\"Wood\"/>\n\n===Fluidity of time===\n''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' contains several ideas concerning time. Although the story can be read as a linear progression of events, both when considering individual lives and Macondo's history, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez allows room for several other interpretations of time:\n* He reiterates the metaphor of history as a circular phenomenon through the repetition of names and characteristics belonging to the Buend\u00eda family.<ref>One Hundred Years of Solitude, Encyclopedia Beta.</ref> Over six generations, all the Jos\u00e9 Arcadios possess inquisitive and rational dispositions as well as enormous physical strength.  The Aurelianos, meanwhile, lean towards insularity and quietude. This repetition of traits reproduces the history of the individual characters and, ultimately, a history of the town as a succession of the same mistakes [[ad infinitum]] due to some endogenous [[hubris]] in our nature.\n* The novel explores the issue of timelessness or eternity even within the framework of mortal existence. A major [[Trope (literature)|trope]] with which it accomplishes this task is the alchemist's laboratory in the Buend\u00eda family home.  The laboratory was first designed by Melqu\u00edades near the start of the story and remains essentially unchanged throughout its course.  It is a place where the male Buend\u00eda characters can indulge their will to solitude, whether through attempts to deconstruct the world with reason as in the case of Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda, or by the endless creation and destruction of golden fish as in the case of his son Colonel Aureliano Buend\u00eda. Furthermore, a sense of inevitability prevails throughout the text.  This is a feeling that regardless of what way one looks at time, its encompassing nature is the one truthful admission.\n* On the other hand, it is important to keep in mind that ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'', while basically chronological and \"linear\" enough in its broad outlines, also shows abundant zigzags in time, both flashbacks of matters past and long leaps towards future events. One example of this is the youthful amour between Meme and Mauricio Babilonia, which is already in full swing before we are informed about the origins of the affair.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>\n\n===Incest===\nA recurring theme in ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is the Buend\u00eda family's propensity toward [[incest]].  The patriarch of the family, Jose Arcadio Buend\u00eda, is the first of numerous Buend\u00edas to intermarry when he marries his first cousin, \u00darsula. Furthermore, the fact that \"throughout the novel the family is haunted by the fear of punishment in the form of the birth of a monstrous child with a pig's tail\"<ref name=\"Bell\"/> can be attributed to this initial act and the recurring acts of incest among the Buend\u00edas.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>\n\n===Elitism===\nA theme throughout ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is the [[elitism]] of the Buend\u00eda family. Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez shows his criticism of the Latin American elite through the stories of the members a high-status family who are essentially in love with themselves, to the point of being unable to understand the mistakes of their past and learn from them.<ref name=\":0\">Elsey, Brenda. \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude.\u201d History of Latin America 1810-Present.

Macondo was founded in the remote jungles of the Colombian rainforest.  The solitude of the town is representative of the colonial period in Latin American history, where outposts and colonies were, for all intents and purposes, not interconnected.<ref name=\"Bell\"/> Isolated from the rest of the world, the Buend\u00edas grow to be increasingly solitary and selfish.  With every member of the family living only for him or her self, the Buend\u00edas become representative of the aristocratic, land-owning elite who came to dominate Latin America in keeping with the sense of Latin American history symbolized in the novel.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>  This egocentricity is embodied, especially, in the characters of Aureliano, who lives in a private world of his own, and Remedios the Beauty, who innocently destroys the lives of four men enamored by her unbelievable beauty, because she is living in a different reality due to what some see as autism. <ref name=\"Bell\"/>  Throughout the novel it seems as if no character can find true love or escape the destructiveness of their own egocentricity.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>\n\nThe selfishness of the Buend\u00eda family is eventually broken by the once superficial Aureliano Segundo and Petra Cotes, who discover a sense of mutual solidarity and the joy of helping others in need during Macondo's economic crisis.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>  The pair even find love, and their pattern is repeated by Aureliano Babilonia and Amaranta \u00darsula.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>  Eventually, Aureliano and Amaranta \u00darsula have a child, and the latter is convinced that it will represent a fresh start for the once-conceited Buend\u00eda family.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>  However, the child turns out to be the perpetually feared monster with the pig's tail.\n\nNonetheless, the appearance of love represents a shift in Macondo, albeit one that leads to its destruction.  \"The emergence of love in the novel to displace the traditional egoism of the Buend\u00edas reflects the emergence of socialist values as a political force in Latin America, a force that will sweep away the Buend\u00edas and the order they represent.\"<ref name=\"Bell\"/>  The ending to ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' could be a wishful prediction by Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, a well-known socialist, regarding the future of Latin America.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>\n\n==Interpretation==\n{{rquote|right|''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' works on so many levels, from childlike fantasy to exploration of the grief or happiness that solitude can bring, that it can be re-read without any reduction in enjoyment \u2013 in fact, each reading brings a wealth of forgotten or previously unnoticed details to the reader, wrapped in a lightness of style that gives this novel a charisma that assures its appeal.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A662997 ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' by Gabriel Garcia Marquez] by [[BBC]], January 1, 2004</ref>}}\n\nThroughout the novel, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez is said to have a gift for blending the everyday with the miraculous, the historical with the fabulous, and psychological realism with surreal flights of fancy. It is a revolutionary novel that provides a looking glass into the thoughts and beliefs of its author, who chose to give a literary voice to Latin America: \"A Latin America which neither wants, nor has any reason, to be a pawn without a will of its own; nor is it merely wishful thinking that its quest for independence and originality should become a Western aspiration.\"<ref>''The Dialectics of our America: Genealogy, Cultural Critique, and Literary History Post-Contemporary Interventions'', by Jos\u00e9 David Sald\u00edvar, Duke University Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-8223-1169-0}}, pg. 21</ref>\n\nAlthough we are faced with a very convoluted narrative, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez is able to define clear themes while maintaining individual character identities, and using different narrative techniques such as [[third-person narrator]]s, specific point of view narrators, and [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|streams of consciousness]].  Cinematographic techniques are also employed in the novel, with the idea of the [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] and the [[close-up]], which effectively combine the comic and grotesque with the dramatic and tragic.

Lastly, through human comedy the problems of a family, a town, and a country are unveiled.

The novel topped the list of books that have most shaped world literature over the last 25 years, according to a survey of international writers commissioned by the global literary journal ''[[Wasafiri]]'' as a part of its 25<small>th</small>-anniversary celebration.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wasafiri.org/pages/news_01/news_item.asp?News_01ID=182 |title=\"25 acclaimed international writers choose 25 of the best books from the last 25 years\" (September 25, 2009) ''Wasafiri Magazine'' |access-date=October 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005175839/http://www.wasafiri.org/pages/news_01/news_item.asp?News_01ID=182 |archive-date=October 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe superlatives from reviewers and readers alike display the resounding praise which the novel has received. [[Chilean people|Chilean]] poet and [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Laureate]] [[Pablo Neruda]] called it \"the greatest revelation in the Spanish language since ''[[Don Quixote]]'' of [[Cervantes]]\", while [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"with a single bound, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez leaps onto the stage with [[G\u00fcnter Grass]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]].\"<ref name = \"PSinsights\" />\n\nAccording to Antonio Sacoto, professor at the [[City College of the City University of New York]], ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is considered as one of the five key novels in Hispanic American literature (together with ''[[El Se\u00f1or Presidente]]'', ''[[Pedro P\u00e1ramo]]'', ''[[The Death of Artemio Cruz|La Muerte de Artemio Cruz]]'', and ''[[La ciudad y los perros]]''). These novels, representative of the boom allowed Hispanic American literature to reach the quality of North American and European literature in terms of technical quality, rich themes, and linguistic innovations, among other attributes.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Antonio Sacoto (1979) ''Cinco novelas claves de la novela hispano americana'' (''[[El se\u00f1or presidente]]'', ''[[Pedro P\u00e1ramo]]'',  ''[[La muerte de Artemio Cruz]]'', ''[[La ciudad y los perros]]'', ''Cien a\u00f1os de soledad''), Eliseo Torres & Sons, New York</ref>\n\nIn his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez addressed the significance of his writing and proposed its role to be more than just literary expression:\n\n{{quote|I dare to think that it is this outsized reality, and not just its literary expression, that has deserved the attention of the Swedish Academy of Letters. A reality not of paper, but one that lives within us and determines each instant of our countless daily deaths, and that nourishes a source of insatiable creativity, full of sorrow and beauty, of which this roving and nostalgic Colombian is but one cipher more, singled out by fortune. Poets and beggars, musicians and prophets, warriors and scoundrels, all creatures of that unbridled reality, we have had to ask but little of imagination, for our crucial problem has been a lack of conventional means to render our lives believable. This, my friends, is the crux of our solitude.<ref>Marquez, Gabriel Garcia. Nobel Lecture, Hispanic Heritage in the Americas. Nobel Lecture, 8 December 1982</ref>}}\n\n==Critiques==\nAlthough ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' has come to be considered one of, if not the, most influential Latin American texts of all time, the novel and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez have both received occasional criticisms. Stylistically, [[Harold Bloom]] remarked that \"My primary impression, in the act of rereading ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'', is a kind of aesthetic battle fatigue, since every page is rammed full of life beyond the capacity of any single reader to absorb... There are no wasted sentences, no mere transitions, in this novel, and you must notice everything at the moment you read it.\"<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''Bloom's Critical Interpretations'': Edited and with an Introduction by Harold Bloom: \"Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude\". Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2003</ref> Additionally, [[David Haberly]] alleges that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez may have borrowed themes from several works, such as [[William Faulkner]]'s [[Yoknapatawpha County]], [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'', [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]]'s ''[[A Journal of the Plague Year]]'', and [[Chateaubriand]]'s ''[[Atala (novella)|Atala]]''. This, however, is not necessarily a negative criticism, as it involves the concept of [[intertextuality]].<ref>Haberly, David T. (1990) ''Bags of Bones: A Source for Cien A\u00f1os de Soledad'', The Johns Hopkins University Press</ref>\n\n==Internal references==\nIn the novel's account of the civil war and subsequent peace, there are numerous mentions of the pensions not arriving for the veterans, a reference to one of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's earlier works, ''El coronel no tiene quien le escriba''. In the novel's final chapter, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez refers to the novel ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cort\u00e1zar novel)|Hopscotch]]'' (Spanish: ''Rayuela'') by [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]] in the following line: \"...in the room that smelled of boiled cauliflower where Rocamadour was to die\" (p.&nbsp;412). Rocamadour is a fictional character in ''Hopscotch'' who indeed dies in the room described. He also refers to two other major works by Latin American writers in the novel: ''[[The Death of Artemio Cruz]]'' (Spanish: ''La Muerte de Artemio Cruz'') by Carlos Fuentes and ''[[Explosion in a Cathedral]]'' (Spanish: ''El siglo de las luces'') by [[Alejo Carpentier]].\n\n==Adaptations==\nWhile ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' has had a large effect on the literary world and is the author's best-selling and most translated work, there have been no movies produced of it as Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez  never agreed to sell the rights to produce such a film. On March 6, 2019, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's son Rodrigo Garc\u00eda Barcha, announced that [[Netflix]] was developing a series based upon the book with a set release in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eltiempo.com/cultura/cine-y-tv/netflix-hara-una-serie-de-la-novela-cien-anos-de-soledad-de-gabriel-garcia-marquez-334516 |date=March 6, 2019 |access-date=6 March 2019 |title='Cien a\u00f1os de soledad' se convertir\u00e1 en una serie de Netflix |last=Hoyos Vargas |first=Andr\u00e9s |website=El Tiempo |language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/07/netflix-to-adapt-one-hundred-years-of-solitude-by-gabriel-garcia-marquez</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/08/colombians-await-one-hundred-years-of-solitude-screen-adaptation-with-joy-and-fear</ref>\n\n[[Sh\u016bji Terayama|Shuji Terayama]]'s play ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' (\u767e\u5e74\u306e\u5b64\u72ec, originally performed by the [[Tenj\u014d Sajiki|Tenjo Sajiki]] theater troupe) and his film ''[[Farewell to the Ark]]'' (\u3055\u3089\u3070\u7bb1\u821f) are loose (and not officially authorized) adaptations of the novel by Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez transplanted into the realm of Japanese culture and history.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century|''Le Monde''{{'s}} 100 Books of the Century]]\n* [[List of best-selling books]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/15/reviews/marque-solitude.html \"Memory and Prophecy, Illusion and Reality Are Mixed and Made to Look the Same\"] by ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 8, 1970\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/12/gabriel-garcia-marquez-one-hundred-years-of-solitude-history |title=The Secret History of ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |author=Sally Soame |date=December 2015}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Britannica|429058}}\n\n=== Reading curriculum ===\n* [http://www.oprah.com/oprahsbookclub/Synopsis-of-One-Hundred-Years-of-Solitude Oprah's Book Club's Guide to ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'']\n* [http://edsitement.neh.gov/curriculum-unit/magical-realism-one-hundred-years-solitude-common-core Magical Realism in \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude\u201d]\n\n=== Lectures and recordings ===\n* [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1982/marquez-lecture.html \"The Solitude of Latin America\"], Nobel lecture by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, 8 December 1982\n* [http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/introser/marquez.HTM \"On Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude\"] \u2013 a lecture by Ian Johnston\n* {{cite web|author=Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Gabriel|title=Colombian writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez reading the first chapter of One Hundred Years of Solitude|url=http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/32972|language=Spanish}}\n\n{{Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:One Hundred Years Of Solitude}}\n[[Category:1967 novels]]\n[[Category:Family saga novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]\n[[Category:Colombian magic realism novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Colombia]]\n[[Category:Harper & Row books]]\n[[Category:Jonathan Cape books]]\n[[Category:Novels about sleep disorders]]\n", "name_user": "VenatorCM", "label": "safe", "comment": "Changed sales numbers from 30 to 50 million based on obituary in The Economist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude"}
