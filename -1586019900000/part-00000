Once cliffs erode, midden-remains become exposed as blackened areas containing charred stones, bones, and shells. They are usually found a metre below the surface. Mesolithic people did not have major rituals associated with burial, unlike those of the Neolithic (New Stone Age) period.<ref name=\"The Neolithic, or New Stone Age\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/pre_norman_history/neolithic_age.html |title=Travel with us through the history of Ireland! |accessdate=2013-04-26 }}</ref>\nThe Neolithic period followed the Mesolithic around 6,000 years ago. People began to farm the land, domesticate animals for food and milk, and settle in one place for longer periods. The people had skills such as making pottery, building houses from wood, weaving, and knapping (stone tool working). The first farmers cleared forestry to graze livestock and grow crops. In North Mayo, where the ground cover was fragile, thin soils washed away and [[blanket bog]] covered the land farmed by the Neolithic people.\n\nExtensive pre-bog field systems have been discovered under the blanket bog, particularly along the North Mayo coastline in [[Erris]] and north [[Tyrawley]] at sites such as the [[C\u00e9ide Fields]], centred on the north east coast.\n\nThe Neolithic people developed rituals associated with burying their dead; this is why they built huge, elaborate, galleried stone tombs for their dead leaders, known nowadays as megalithic tombs. There are over 160 recorded megaliths in County Mayo, such as [[Faulagh]].\n\n[[File:Greystone011-6may08 004.JPG|thumb|Megalithic tomb at [[Faulagh]], [[Erris]]]]\n\n===Megalithic tombs===\nThere are four distinct types of [[Irish megalithic tombs]]\u2014[[court cairn|court tomb]]s, [[Dolmen|portal tomb]]s, [[passage grave|passage tomb]]s and [[wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge tomb]]s\u2014examples of all of which can be found in County Mayo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Heritage |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607072658/http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Heritage/ |archive-date=7 June 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Areas particularly rich in megalithic tombs include [[Achill Island|Achill]], [[Kilcommon]], [[Ballyhaunis]], [[Moygownagh]], [[Killala]] and the Behy/Glenurla area around the [[C\u00e9ide Fields]].\n\n===Bronze Age (ca. 2,500 BC to 500 BC)===\nMegalithic tomb building continued into the [[Bronze Age]] when metal began to be worked for tools alongside the stone tools. The Bronze Age lasted approximately from 4,500 years ago to 2,500 years ago (2,500 BC to 500 BC). Archaeological remains from this period include [[stone row|stone alignments]], [[stone circle]]s and [[Fulacht fiadh|fulachta fiadh]] (early cooking sites). They continued to bury their chieftains in megalithic tombs which changed design during this period, more being of the [[wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge tomb]] type and [[cist]] burials.\n\n===Iron Age (ca. 500 BC to AD 325)===\nAround 2,500 years ago the [[Iron Age]] took over from the Bronze Age as more and more metalworking took place. This is thought to have coincided with the arrival of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] speaking peoples and the introduction of the ancestor of Irish. Towards the end of this period, the Roman Empire was at its height in Britain but it is not thought that the Roman Empire extended into Ireland to any large degree. Remains from this period, which lasted until the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] period began about AD 325 (with the arrival of St. Patrick into Ireland, as a slave) include [[crann\u00f3g]]s (Lake dwellings), [[promontory fort]]s, [[ringfort]]s and [[souterrain]]s of which there are numerous examples across the county.\nThe [[Iron Age]] was a time of tribal warfare with kingships, each fighting neighbouring kings, vying for control of territories and taking slaves. Territories were marked by tall stone markers, [[Ogham]] stones, using the first written down words using the [[Ogham inscription|Ogham alphabet]]. The Iron Age is the time period in which the tales of the [[Ulster Cycle]] and sagas took place. The [[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Flidhais]] which took place mainly in [[Erris]] sets the scene well.\n\n===Early Christian period (ca. AD 325 to AD 800)===\n[[File:Aghagower St Patrick Statue 2007 08 12.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Statue of St. Patrick Aghagower]]\nChristianity came to Ireland around the start of the 5th century. It brought many changes including the introduction of writing and recording events. The tribal 'tuatha' and the new religious settlements existed side by side. Sometimes it suited the chieftains to become part of the early Churches, other times they remained as separate entities. St. Patrick (4th century) may have spent time in County Mayo and it is believed that he spent forty days and forty nights on Croagh Patrick praying for the people of Ireland. From the middle of the 6th century hundreds of small monastic settlements were established around the county.<ref name=\"County Mayo: An Outline History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mayo-ireland.ie/Mayo/History/FullHist.htm |title=County Mayo: An Outline History by Bernard O'Hara and Nollaig \u00d3'Mura\u00edle |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref> Some examples of well-known early monastic sites in Mayo include [[Mayo Abbey]], [[Aughagower]], [[Ballintubber]], [[Errew Abbey]], [[Cong Abbey]], [[Killala]], Turlough on the outskirts of Castlebar, and island settlements off the [[Mullet Peninsula]] like the [[Inishkea Islands]], [[Inishglora]] and [[Duvillaun]].\n\nIn 795 the first of the [[Viking]] raids took place. The Vikings came from [[Scandinavia]] to raid the monasteries as they were places of wealth with precious metal working taking place in them. Some of the larger ecclesiastical settlements erected [[Irish round tower|round tower]]s to prevent their precious items being plundered and also to show their status and strength against these pagan raiders from the north. There are round towers at [[Aughagower]], [[Balla, County Mayo|Balla]], [[Killala]], Turlough and Meelick. The Vikings established settlements which later developed into towns (Dublin, Cork, Wexford, Waterford etc..) but none were in County Mayo. Between the reigns of [[Kings of Connacht]] [[Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg]] (973\u20131010) and [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]] (1106\u20131156), various tribal territories were incorporated into the kingdom of Connacht and ruled by the Siol Muirdaig dynasty, based initially at [[Rathcroghan]] in [[County Roscommon]], and from c. 1050 at [[Tuam]]. The families of [[O'Malley (surname)|O'Malley]] and [[O'Dowd]] of Mayo served as [[admiral]]s of the [[Naval fleet|fleet]] of [[Connacht]], while families such as O'Lachtnan, [[Mac Fhirbhisigh]], and O'Cleary were ecclesiastical and bardic clans.\n\n===Anglo-Normans (12th to 16th centuries)===\nIn AD 1169 when one of the warring kings in the east of Ireland, [[Dermot MacMurrough]], appealed to the King of England for help in his fight with a neighbouring king, the response was the arrival of the Anglo-Norman colonisation of Ireland.\nCounty Mayo came under Norman control in AD 1235. Norman control meant the eclipse of many Gaelic lords and chieftains, chiefly the O'Connors of Connacht.<ref name=\"County Mayo: An Outline History\" /> During the 1230s, the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]]s and [[Wales|Welsh]] under [[Richard M\u00f3r de Burgh]] (c. 1194 \u2013 1242) invaded and settled in the county, introducing new families such as [[Burke (surname)|Burke]], [[Gibbons]], [[Staunton (surname)|Staunton]], [[Prendergast (disambiguation)|Prendergast]], [[Morris (surname)|Morris]], [[Joyce (name)|Joyce]], [[Walsh (surname)|Walsh]], [[Barrett (surname)|Barrett]], [[Lynott (disambiguation)|Lynott]], [[Costello (surname)|Costello]], [[Padden]] and [[Price]], Norman names are still common in County Mayo. Following the collapse of the lordship in the 1330s, all these families became [[Family estrangement|estranged]] from the [[Anglo-Irish]] administration based in [[Dublin]] and assimilated with the Gaelic-Irish, adopting their language, religion, dress, laws, customs and culture and marrying into Irish families. They \"became more Irish than the Irish themselves\".\n\nThe most powerful clan to emerge during this era were the Mac William Burkes, also known as the Mac William Iochtar (see Burke Civil War 1333\u20131338), descended from Sir William Liath de Burgh, who defeated the Gaelic-Irish at the [[Second Battle of Athenry]] in August 1316. They were frequently at war with their cousins, [[Clanricarde]] of [[Galway]], and in alliance with or against various factions of the O'Conor's of Siol Muiredaig and [[Kelly (surname)|O'Kelly]]'s of [[U\u00ed Maine]]. The [[O'Donnell dynasty|O'Donnell]]'s of [[Tyrconnell]] regularly invaded in an attempt to secure their right to rule.\n\nThe Anglo Normans encouraged and established many religious orders from continental Europe to settle in Ireland. Mendicant orders\u2014Augustinians, Carmelites, Dominicans and Franciscans began new settlements across Ireland and built large churches, many under the patronage of prominent [[Gaels|Gaelic]] families. Some of these sites include [[Cong, County Mayo|Cong]], [[Strade]], [[Ballintubber]], [[Errew Abbey]], [[Burrishoole Friary|Burrishoole Abbey]] and [[Mayo Abbey]].<ref name=\"Anglo-Norman\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-due.de/LI/Anglo_Norman.htm|title=Universit\u00e4t Duisburg-Essen: Language in Ireland |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref> During the 15th and 16th centuries, despite regular conflicts between them as England chopped and changed between religious beliefs, the Irish usually regarded the King of England as their King. When [[Elizabeth I]] came to the throne in the mid-16th century, the English people, as was customary at that time, followed the religious practices of the reigning monarch and became Protestant. Many Irish people such as [[Gr\u00e1\u00ednne O'Malley]], the famous pirate queen, had close relationships with the English monarchy, and the English kings and queens were welcome visitors to Irish shores. The Irish however, generally held onto their Catholic religious practices and beliefs. The early plantations of settlers in Ireland began during the reign of Queen Mary in the mid-16th century and continued throughout the long reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] until 1603. By then the term ''County Mayo'' had come into use. In the summer of 1588 the galleons of the [[Spanish Armada]] were wrecked by [[Brian Rua U'Cearbhain|storms along the west coast]] of Ireland. Some of the hapless Spaniards came ashore in Mayo, only to be robbed and imprisoned, and in many cases slaughtered. Almost all the religious foundations set up by the Anglo Normans were suppressed in the wake of the [[Reformation]] in the 16th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/history/15411598.html|title=History of Ireland 1541 - 1598: Protestant Reformation and the Offaly & Munster Plantations|website=www.wesleyjohnston.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Protestantism|Protestant]] settlers from [[Scotland]], [[England]], and elsewhere in Ireland, settled in the County in the early 17th century.

A third of the overall population was reported to have perished due to warfare, famine and plague between 1641 and 1653, with several areas remaining disturbed and frequented by [[Whiteboys|Reparees]] into the 1670s.\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\n[[File:Grace O'Malley00.jpg|left|thumb|[[Gr\u00e1inne O'Malley]] meeting Queen Elizabeth I]]\nPirate Queen Gr\u00e1inne O'Malley is probably the best known person from County Mayo between the mid-16th century and the turn of the 17th century.<ref>http://www.graceomalley.com/timeline.php</ref> In the 1640s, when Oliver Cromwell overthrew the English monarchy and set up a parliamentarian government, Ireland suffered severely.

Because of the penal laws, Catholics had no hope of social advancement while they remained in their native land. Some, like [[William Brown (admiral)|William Brown]] (1777\u20131857), left Foxford with his family at the age of nine and thirty years later was an admiral in the fledgling Argentine Navy. Today he is a national hero in that country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.con-telegraph.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=326:illustrious-and-amazing-career-of-admiral-william-brown&catid=52:mayo-history&Itemid=89 |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718052150/http://www.con-telegraph.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=326:illustrious-and-amazing-career-of-admiral-william-brown&catid=52:mayo-history&Itemid=89 |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe general unrest in Ireland was felt just as keenly across Mayo, and as the 18th century approached and news reached Ireland about the [[American War of Independence]] and the [[French Revolution]], the downtrodden Irish, constantly suppressed by Government policies and decisions from Dublin and London, began to rally themselves for their own stand against British rule in their country. By 1798 the Irish were ready for rebellion. The French came to help the Irish cause. [[Jean Joseph Amable Humbert|General Humbert]], from France landed in [[Killala]] with over 1,000 officers where they started to march across the county towards [[Battle of Castlebar|Castlebar]] where there was a British garrison. Taking them by surprise Humbert's army was victorious. He established a [[Irish Republic (1798)|'Republic of Connacht']] with [[John Moore (Irish politician)|John Moore]] of the Moore family from [[Moore Hall, County Mayo|Moore Hall]] near Partry as its head. Humbert's army marched on towards Sligo, Leitrim and Longford where they were suddenly faced with a massive British army and were forced to surrender in less than half an hour. The French soldiers were treated honourably, but for the Irish the surrender meant slaughter. Many died on the scaffold in towns like Castlebar and Claremorris, where the high sheriff for County Mayo, the Honourable [[Denis Browne (politician)|Denis Browne]], M.P., brother of Lord Altamont, wreaked a terrible vengeance \u2013 thus earning for himself the nickname which has survived in folk memory to the present day, 'Donnchadh an R\u00f3pa' (Denis of the Rope).\n\nIn the 18th century and early 19th century, sectarian tensions arose as evangelical Protestant missionaries sought to 'redeem the Irish poor from the errors of Popery'. One of the best known was the [[Edward Nangle|Rev. Edward Nangle]]'s mission at Dugort in [[Achill Island|Achill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayococo.ie/en/Services/Environment/LeisureAmenities/Beaches/Doogort/|title=Mayo County Council - County Mayo, Ireland -- Doogort|website=www.mayococo.ie}}</ref> These too were the years of the campaign for Catholic Emancipation and, later, for the abolition of the tithes, which a predominately Catholic population was forced to pay for the upkeep of the clergy of the Established (Protestant) Church.\n\n===19th and 20th centuries===\nDuring the early years of the 19th century, famine was a common occurrence, particularly where population pressure was a problem. The population of Ireland grew to over eight million people prior to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] (or Great Famine) of 1845&ndash;47. The Irish people depended on the potato crop for their sustenance. Disaster struck in August 1845, when a killer fungus (later diagnosed as Phytophthora infestans) started to destroy the potato crop. When widespread famine struck, about a million people died and a further million left the country. People died in the fields from starvation and disease. The catastrophe was particularly bad in County Mayo, where nearly ninety per cent of the population depended on the potato as their staple food. By 1848, Mayo was a county of total misery and despair, with any attempts at alleviating measures in complete disarray.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.libraryireland.com/articles/FamineBelmulletFriends/index.php|title=Irish Famine Report from Belmullet, County Mayo (1847)|website=www.libraryireland.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Michael davitt.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Michael Davitt]]]]\nThere are numerous reminders of the Great Famine to be seen on the Mayo landscape: workhouse sites, famine graves, sites of soup kitchens, deserted homes and villages and even traces of undug 'lazy-beds' in fields on the sides of hills. Many roads and lanes were built as famine relief measures. There were nine workhouses in the county: Ballina, Ballinrobe, Belmullet, Castlebar, Claremorris, Killala, Newport, Swinford and Westport.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mayohistory.com/H18to19.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528145751/http://www.mayohistory.com/H18to19.htm |archive-date=28 May 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Irishin1871.jpg|thumb|upright|The distribution of the [[Irish language]] in 1871.

An English landlord called Captain Charles Cunningham [[Boycott]] could get no workers to do anything for him, so unpleasant as he was to them, so he brought in Protestant workers from elsewhere. He spent so much on security and protection for them that his harvest cost him a fortune and also nobody in the area would serve him in shops, or deal with him. This ostracisation became known as \"boycotting\" and Captain Boycott was left with no option but to leave Mayo and take his family with him to England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/learning-zone/primary-students/looking-at-places/mayo/michael-davitt/captain-boycott/|title=Captain Boycott|website=www.askaboutireland.ie|access-date=5 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324033635/http://www.askaboutireland.ie/learning-zone/primary-students/looking-at-places/mayo/michael-davitt/captain-boycott/|archive-date=24 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Land Question\" was gradually resolved by a scheme of state-aided land purchase schemes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/reference/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/irish-land-question|title=Irish Land Question - Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref> The tenants became the owners of their lands under the newly set-up [[Irish Land Commission|Land Commission]].\n\nA Mayo nun, Mother Agnes Morrogh-Bernard (1842\u20131932), set up the Foxford Woollen Mill in 1892.

Once cliffs erode, midden-remains become exposed as blackened areas containing charred stones, bones, and shells. They are usually found a metre below the surface. Mesolithic people did not have major rituals associated with burial, unlike those of the Neolithic (New Stone Age) period.<ref name=\"The Neolithic, or New Stone Age\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/pre_norman_history/neolithic_age.html |title=Travel with us through the history of Ireland! |accessdate=2013-04-26 }}</ref>\nThe Neolithic period followed the Mesolithic around 6,000 years ago. People began to farm the land, domesticate animals for food and milk, and settle in one place for longer periods. The people had skills such as making pottery, building houses from wood, weaving, and knapping (stone tool working). The first farmers cleared forestry to graze livestock and grow crops. In North Mayo, where the ground cover was fragile, thin soils washed away and [[blanket bog]] covered the land farmed by the Neolithic people.\n\nExtensive pre-bog field systems have been discovered under the blanket bog, particularly along the North Mayo coastline in [[Erris]] and north [[Tyrawley]] at sites such as the [[C\u00e9ide Fields]], centred on the north east coast.\n\nThe Neolithic people developed rituals associated with burying their dead; this is why they built huge, elaborate, galleried stone tombs for their dead leaders, known nowadays as megalithic tombs. There are over 160 recorded megaliths in County Mayo, such as [[Faulagh]].\n\n[[File:Greystone011-6may08 004.JPG|thumb|Megalithic tomb at [[Faulagh]], [[Erris]]]]\n\n===Megalithic tombs===\nThere are four distinct types of [[Irish megalithic tombs]]\u2014[[court cairn|court tomb]]s, [[Dolmen|portal tomb]]s, [[passage grave|passage tomb]]s and [[wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge tomb]]s\u2014examples of all of which can be found in County Mayo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Heritage |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607072658/http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Heritage/ |archive-date=7 June 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Areas particularly rich in megalithic tombs include [[Achill Island|Achill]], [[Kilcommon]], [[Ballyhaunis]], [[Moygownagh]], [[Killala]] and the Behy/Glenurla area around the [[C\u00e9ide Fields]].\n\n===Bronze Age (ca. 2,500 BC to 500 BC)===\nMegalithic tomb building continued into the [[Bronze Age]] when metal began to be worked for tools alongside the stone tools. The Bronze Age lasted approximately from 4,500 years ago to 2,500 years ago (2,500 BC to 500 BC). Archaeological remains from this period include [[stone row|stone alignments]], [[stone circle]]s and [[Fulacht fiadh|fulachta fiadh]] (early cooking sites). They continued to bury their chieftains in megalithic tombs which changed design during this period, more being of the [[wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge tomb]] type and [[cist]] burials.\n\n===Iron Age (ca. 500 BC to AD 325)===\nAround 2,500 years ago the [[Iron Age]] took over from the Bronze Age as more and more metalworking took place. This is thought to have coincided with the arrival of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] speaking peoples and the introduction of the ancestor of Irish. Towards the end of this period, the Roman Empire was at its height in Britain but it is not thought that the Roman Empire extended into Ireland to any large degree. Remains from this period, which lasted until the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] period began about AD 325 (with the arrival of St. Patrick into Ireland, as a slave) include [[crann\u00f3g]]s (Lake dwellings), [[promontory fort]]s, [[ringfort]]s and [[souterrain]]s of which there are numerous examples across the county.\nThe [[Iron Age]] was a time of tribal warfare with kingships, each fighting neighbouring kings, vying for control of territories and taking slaves. Territories were marked by tall stone markers, [[Ogham]] stones, using the first written down words using the [[Ogham inscription|Ogham alphabet]]. The Iron Age is the time period in which the tales of the [[Ulster Cycle]] and sagas took place. The [[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Flidhais]] which took place mainly in [[Erris]] sets the scene well.\n\n===Early Christian period (ca. AD 325 to AD 800)===\n[[File:Aghagower St Patrick Statue 2007 08 12.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Statue of St. Patrick Aghagower]]\nChristianity came to Ireland around the start of the 5th century. It brought many changes including the introduction of writing and recording events. The tribal 'tuatha' and the new religious settlements existed side by side. Sometimes it suited the chieftains to become part of the early Churches, other times they remained as separate entities. St. Patrick (4th century) may have spent time in County Mayo and it is believed that he spent forty days and forty nights on Croagh Patrick praying for the people of Ireland. From the middle of the 6th century hundreds of small monastic settlements were established around the county.<ref name=\"County Mayo: An Outline History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mayo-ireland.ie/Mayo/History/FullHist.htm |title=County Mayo: An Outline History by Bernard O'Hara and Nollaig \u00d3'Mura\u00edle |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref> Some examples of well-known early monastic sites in Mayo include [[Mayo Abbey]], [[Aughagower]], [[Ballintubber]], [[Errew Abbey]], [[Cong Abbey]], [[Killala]], Turlough on the outskirts of Castlebar, and island settlements off the [[Mullet Peninsula]] like the [[Inishkea Islands]], [[Inishglora]] and [[Duvillaun]].\n\nIn 795 the first of the [[Viking]] raids took place. The Vikings came from [[Scandinavia]] to raid the monasteries as they were places of wealth with precious metal working taking place in them. Some of the larger ecclesiastical settlements erected [[Irish round tower|round tower]]s to prevent their precious items being plundered and also to show their status and strength against these pagan raiders from the north. There are round towers at [[Aughagower]], [[Balla, County Mayo|Balla]], [[Killala]], Turlough and Meelick. The Vikings established settlements which later developed into towns (Dublin, Cork, Wexford, Waterford etc..) but none were in County Mayo. Between the reigns of [[Kings of Connacht]] [[Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg]] (973\u20131010) and [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]] (1106\u20131156), various tribal territories were incorporated into the kingdom of Connacht and ruled by the Siol Muirdaig dynasty, based initially at [[Rathcroghan]] in [[County Roscommon]], and from c. 1050 at [[Tuam]]. The families of [[O'Malley (surname)|O'Malley]] and [[O'Dowd]] of Mayo served as [[admiral]]s of the [[Naval fleet|fleet]] of [[Connacht]], while families such as O'Lachtnan, [[Mac Fhirbhisigh]], and O'Cleary were ecclesiastical and bardic clans.\n\n===Anglo-Normans (12th to 16th centuries)===\nIn AD 1169 when one of the warring kings in the east of Ireland, [[Dermot MacMurrough]], appealed to the King of England for help in his fight with a neighbouring king, the response was the arrival of the Anglo-Norman colonisation of Ireland.\nCounty Mayo came under Norman control in AD 1235. Norman control meant the eclipse of many Gaelic lords and chieftains, chiefly the O'Connors of Connacht.<ref name=\"County Mayo: An Outline History\" /> During the 1230s, the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]]s and [[Wales|Welsh]] under [[Richard M\u00f3r de Burgh]] (c. 1194 \u2013 1242) invaded and settled in the county, introducing new families such as [[Burke (surname)|Burke]], [[Gibbons]], [[Staunton (surname)|Staunton]], [[Prendergast (disambiguation)|Prendergast]], [[Morris (surname)|Morris]], [[Joyce (name)|Joyce]], [[Walsh (surname)|Walsh]], [[Barrett (surname)|Barrett]], [[Lynott (disambiguation)|Lynott]], [[Costello (surname)|Costello]], [[Padden]] and [[Price]], Norman names are still common in County Mayo. Following the collapse of the lordship in the 1330s, all these families became [[Family estrangement|estranged]] from the [[Anglo-Irish]] administration based in [[Dublin]] and assimilated with the Gaelic-Irish, adopting their language, religion, dress, laws, customs and culture and marrying into Irish families. They \"became more Irish than the Irish themselves\".\n\nThe most powerful clan to emerge during this era were the Mac William Burkes, also known as the Mac William Iochtar (see Burke Civil War 1333\u20131338), descended from Sir William Liath de Burgh, who defeated the Gaelic-Irish at the [[Second Battle of Athenry]] in August 1316. They were frequently at war with their cousins, [[Clanricarde]] of [[Galway]], and in alliance with or against various factions of the O'Conor's of Siol Muiredaig and [[Kelly (surname)|O'Kelly]]'s of [[U\u00ed Maine]]. The [[O'Donnell dynasty|O'Donnell]]'s of [[Tyrconnell]] regularly invaded in an attempt to secure their right to rule.\n\nThe Anglo Normans encouraged and established many religious orders from continental Europe to settle in Ireland. Mendicant orders\u2014Augustinians, Carmelites, Dominicans and Franciscans began new settlements across Ireland and built large churches, many under the patronage of prominent [[Gaels|Gaelic]] families. Some of these sites include [[Cong, County Mayo|Cong]], [[Strade]], [[Ballintubber]], [[Errew Abbey]], [[Burrishoole Friary|Burrishoole Abbey]] and [[Mayo Abbey]].<ref name=\"Anglo-Norman\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-due.de/LI/Anglo_Norman.htm|title=Universit\u00e4t Duisburg-Essen: Language in Ireland |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref> During the 15th and 16th centuries, despite regular conflicts between them as England chopped and changed between religious beliefs, the Irish usually regarded the King of England as their King. When [[Elizabeth I]] came to the throne in the mid-16th century, the English people, as was customary at that time, followed the religious practices of the reigning monarch and became Protestant. Many Irish people such as [[Gr\u00e1\u00ednne O'Malley]], the famous pirate queen, had close relationships with the English monarchy, and the English kings and queens were welcome visitors to Irish shores. The Irish however, generally held onto their Catholic religious practices and beliefs. The early plantations of settlers in Ireland began during the reign of Queen Mary in the mid-16th century and continued throughout the long reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] until 1603. By then the term ''County Mayo'' had come into use. In the summer of 1588 the galleons of the [[Spanish Armada]] were wrecked by [[Brian Rua U'Cearbhain|storms along the west coast]] of Ireland. Some of the hapless Spaniards came ashore in Mayo, only to be robbed and imprisoned, and in many cases slaughtered. Almost all the religious foundations set up by the Anglo Normans were suppressed in the wake of the [[Reformation]] in the 16th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/history/15411598.html|title=History of Ireland 1541 - 1598: Protestant Reformation and the Offaly & Munster Plantations|website=www.wesleyjohnston.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Protestantism|Protestant]] settlers from [[Scotland]], [[England]], and elsewhere in Ireland, settled in the County in the early 17th century.

Because of the penal laws, Catholics had no hope of social advancement while they remained in their native land. Some, like [[William Brown (admiral)|William Brown]] (1777\u20131857), left Foxford with his family at the age of nine and thirty years later was an admiral in the fledgling Argentine Navy. Today he is a national hero in that country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.con-telegraph.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=326:illustrious-and-amazing-career-of-admiral-william-brown&catid=52:mayo-history&Itemid=89 |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718052150/http://www.con-telegraph.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=326:illustrious-and-amazing-career-of-admiral-william-brown&catid=52:mayo-history&Itemid=89 |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe general unrest in Ireland was felt just as keenly across Mayo, and as the 18th century approached and news reached Ireland about the [[American War of Independence]] and the [[French Revolution]], the downtrodden Irish, constantly suppressed by Government policies and decisions from Dublin and London, began to rally themselves for their own stand against British rule in their country. By 1798 the Irish were ready for rebellion. The French came to help the Irish cause. [[Jean Joseph Amable Humbert|General Humbert]], from France landed in [[Killala]] with over 1,000 officers where they started to march across the county towards [[Battle of Castlebar|Castlebar]] where there was a British garrison. Taking them by surprise Humbert's army was victorious. He established a [[Irish Republic (1798)|'Republic of Connacht']] with [[John Moore (Irish politician)|John Moore]] of the Moore family from [[Moore Hall, County Mayo|Moore Hall]] near Partry as its head. Humbert's army marched on towards Sligo, Leitrim and Longford where they were suddenly faced with a massive British army and were forced to surrender in less than half an hour. The French soldiers were treated honourably, but for the Irish the surrender meant slaughter. Many died on the scaffold in towns like Castlebar and Claremorris, where the high sheriff for County Mayo, the Honourable [[Denis Browne (politician)|Denis Browne]], M.P., brother of Lord Altamont, wreaked a terrible vengeance \u2013 thus earning for himself the nickname which has survived in folk memory to the present day, 'Donnchadh an R\u00f3pa' (Denis of the Rope).\n\nIn the 18th century and early 19th century, sectarian tensions arose as evangelical Protestant missionaries sought to 'redeem the Irish poor from the errors of Popery'. One of the best known was the [[Edward Nangle|Rev. Edward Nangle]]'s mission at Dugort in [[Achill Island|Achill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayococo.ie/en/Services/Environment/LeisureAmenities/Beaches/Doogort/|title=Mayo County Council - County Mayo, Ireland -- Doogort|website=www.mayococo.ie}}</ref> These too were the years of the campaign for Catholic Emancipation and, later, for the abolition of the tithes, which a predominately Catholic population was forced to pay for the upkeep of the clergy of the Established (Protestant) Church.\n\n===19th and 20th centuries===\nDuring the early years of the 19th century, famine was a common occurrence, particularly where population pressure was a problem. The population of Ireland grew to over eight million people prior to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] (or Great Famine) of 1845&ndash;47. The Irish people depended on the potato crop for their sustenance. Disaster struck in August 1845, when a killer fungus (later diagnosed as Phytophthora infestans) started to destroy the potato crop. When widespread famine struck, about a million people died and a further million left the country. People died in the fields from starvation and disease. The catastrophe was particularly bad in County Mayo, where nearly ninety per cent of the population depended on the potato as their staple food. By 1848, Mayo was a county of total misery and despair, with any attempts at alleviating measures in complete disarray.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.libraryireland.com/articles/FamineBelmulletFriends/index.php|title=Irish Famine Report from Belmullet, County Mayo (1847)|website=www.libraryireland.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Michael davitt.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Michael Davitt]]]]\nThere are numerous reminders of the Great Famine to be seen on the Mayo landscape: workhouse sites, famine graves, sites of soup kitchens, deserted homes and villages and even traces of undug 'lazy-beds' in fields on the sides of hills.

Initially triggered by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] and then in search of work in the newly industrialising United Kingdom and the United States, the population fell considerably. From 388,887 in 1841, the population fell to 199,166 in 1901. The population reached a low of 109,525 in 1971 as emigration continued. Emigration slowed down as the Irish economy began to expand in the 1990s and early 2000s.

During her childhood and adolescence she studied with several teachers such as [[Silvia H. Gonzalez]], [[Teresa Cito]], [[Perla Krauze]] and [[Eugenia Marcos]]. Later, she was accepted to the [[National Conservatory of Music of Mexico|National Conservatory of Music]] but only studied for one year from 1981 to 1982. In 1987, she entered the [[SACI Studio Art Centers International]] in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], and then studied at the [[Chelsea School of Art]] in [[London]] in 1988. On her return to Mexico, she entered [[National School of Arts (UNAM)|National School of Fine Arts]] froM 1989 to 1992, attending the [[gravure]] workshop given by [[Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez (artist)|Jes\u00fas Martinez]] and [[Maria Eugenia Figueroa]]. While in school, she had her first solo exhibition in 1988 in Lourdes Chumacero Gallery in [[Mexico City]]. Her work was chosen to participate in student competitions, such as at the Royal  \"ACADEMY Summer Exhibition\" and \"Open Print Show\" at the [[Bankside Gallery]] in London in 1989. In 1990 she received the Third Acquisition Sample Miniature Stamp Award, Stamp Museum Purchase Award and the Hall of Engraving Salon de la Plastica Mexicana, in Mexico City. In 1992, she received an honorable mention at the [[Diego Rivera]] Biennial of Prints and Drawings in [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]], Mexico. In 1996, she was invited to participate at the Salon Bancomer II in Mexico City.<ref name=\"SP\">{{cite web |url= http://www.sandrapani.com/ |title= Sandra Pani |accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1991 and 1998, she received the Grant for Young Artists of the National Fund for Culture and the Arts (FONCA) Mexico City. And in 2007 and 2011, she was made a member of the National System of Creators, the National Fund for Culture and the Arts (FONCA) Mexico City. Her work was selected for the Fifth Bienal Monterrey FEMSA in 2001, as well as for Yucat\u00e1n Biennial at the MACAY Museum in [[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n|M\u00e9rida]], in 2004.

According to Salvador Elizondo, art critic from [[Milenio]] newspaper, ''these paintings represent the point at which the movement and life balance are  expressive forms and unique heritage. Sandra Pani's paintings exhibited in her exposition of 1994 (Gallery Lourdes Chumacero) presume that had surfaced since then in this artist boldly pursued the ideal of Leonardo and D\u00fcrer: \"Penetrating geomentr\u00eda mechanisms and in the body, but in a less categorical, freer, more lyrical''.\" <ref name=\"Salvador Elizondo\">{{cite book |title= Sandra Pani Bistur\u00eda \u00d3ptico |last= Elizondo |first= Salvador |authorlink= |year=1998 |publisher= departamento de publicaciones del Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes, CONACULTA |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> She is an artist whose soul is for the moment obsessed with the body as a complex or synthesis of parts  or figures that integrate  pictorial  poetics. They are so to speak, anatomical inventions, variations or fantasies. These paintings aspire to capture the essence of the human body, an essence that could only be formal; a yearning for the body to be soul and for the soul to be made visible by a sign.<ref name=\"Salvador Elizondo milenio\">{{cite news |title=Dibujar es pensar |first= Salvador |last= Elizondo |newspaper= Milenio |date= 2003-11-23 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Miguel \u00c1ngel Mu\u00f1oz art critic from [[El Financiero]] newspaper,  ''Sandra Pani belongs to a generation of artists that has considered painting as something exhausted, old fashioned and, to a certain extent, dead''. It is certainly significant that Pani\u00b4s abstract, semi-figurative and almost classical approach to painting should have arisen at the peak of the conceptual and minimalist movements. Still, it might be argued that its conviction springs precisely from those apparently inauspicious beginnings. Pani\u00b4s works can be said to be figurative with certain poetical abstract accents. They are rooted in 20th-century painters such as Picasso, Morandi, Matisse and Giacometti, and in some modernist artists, especially North American abstract painters.<ref name=\"Miguel \u00c1ngel Mu\u00f1oz\">{{cite news |title=La geograf\u00eda del cuerpo, los abstractos acentos po\u00e9ticos |first=Miguel \u00c1ngel |last=Mu\u00f1oz |newspaper=El Financiero |date=2003-11-12 |url=http://www.sandrapani.com/sitio_oficial/bibliografia.html}}</ref> In the [[La Jornada]] newspaper, Mu\u00f1oz states that Sandra Pani's drawings at the Festival Internacional Cervantino on its 39th edition in 2011 were in effect a decantation, which runs and drips as something that falls within a long time to stay only with the essence. An almost nothing, which is the record of almost everything. An atmosphere. A sign.<ref name=\"Miguel \u00c1ngel Mu\u00f1oz2\">{{cite news |title=39 Festival Internacional Cervantino |first=Miguel \u00c1ngel |last=Mu\u00f1oz |newspaper=La Jornada |date=2011-04-01}}</ref>\n\nSantiago Espinosa de los Monteros from [[Colonia Roma#Casa Lamm|Casa Lamm Gallery]],says that  ''using only a few lines she describes moments in an almost Oriental style, drawing simple and almost rudimentary sketches over her two-dimensional medium in a way that bares the work - unbridling it from anything that might stop it from achieving total expression. Her work is free from the narrative temptation, which often prevents us from grasping a missing story that becomes manifest by its very absence.'' In her work a pendular movement can be perceived  that comes and goes from abstraction to figuration, as if from one extreme to the other. It briefly stops at both ends, but does not stay at either.

Retrieved 2011-11-09.</ref> in [[Mexico City]]) is a Mexican artist.\n\n==Background==\n\nShe showed an interest for painting and music since she was very young, beginning piano lessons when she was 9 years old. During her childhood and adolescence she studied with several teachers such as [[Silvia H. Gonzalez]], [[Teresa Cito]], [[Perla Krauze]] and [[Eugenia Marcos]]. Later, she was accepted to the [[National Conservatory of Music of Mexico|National Conservatory of Music]] but only studied for one year from 1981 to 1982. In 1987, she entered the [[SACI Studio Art Centers International]] in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], and then studied at the [[Chelsea School of Art]] in [[London]] in 1988. On her return to Mexico, she entered [[National School of Arts (UNAM)|National School of Fine Arts]] froM 1989 to 1992, attending the [[gravure]] workshop given by [[Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez (artist)|Jes\u00fas Martinez]] and [[Maria Eugenia Figueroa]]. While in school, she had her first solo exhibition in 1988 in Lourdes Chumacero Gallery in [[Mexico City]]. Her work was chosen to participate in student competitions, such as at the Royal  \"ACADEMY Summer Exhibition\" and \"Open Print Show\" at the [[Bankside Gallery]] in London in 1989. In 1990 she received the Third Acquisition Sample Miniature Stamp Award, Stamp Museum Purchase Award and the Hall of Engraving Salon de la Plastica Mexicana, in Mexico City. In 1992, she received an honorable mention at the [[Diego Rivera]] Biennial of Prints and Drawings in [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]], Mexico. In 1996, she was invited to participate at the Salon Bancomer II in Mexico City.<ref name=\"SP\">{{cite web |url= http://www.sandrapani.com/ |title= Sandra Pani |accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1991 and 1998, she received the Grant for Young Artists of the National Fund for Culture and the Arts (FONCA) Mexico City. And in 2007 and 2011, she was made a member of the National System of Creators, the National Fund for Culture and the Arts (FONCA) Mexico City. Her work was selected for the Fifth Bienal Monterrey FEMSA in 2001, as well as for Yucat\u00e1n Biennial at the MACAY Museum in [[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n|M\u00e9rida]], in 2004. She has had twenty solo exhibitions including: \"If tree\" at the [[University of Guanajuato]]'s [[Hermenegildo Bustos|Hermenegildo Bustos Gallery]] during the [[Festival Internacional Cervantino]] (2011), \"Duality and transformation\" at the [[Anahuacalli Museum]] (2009), \"From trees and bodies\" at the Indianilla Station Cultural Center in [[Colonia Doctores]], Mexico City (2008), \"Body recovered,\" at the Gene Byron Museum in Guanajuato, \"Geography of the Body\" at the Gene Byron Museum as part of the Festival Internacional Cervantino (2003), \"Recent Drawings 1998-1999\" at the MACAY Museum in M\u00e9rida (1999), \"Optical Scalpel\" at the Museo Diego Rivera in Guanajuato (1998); and \"Survive\" at the University Museum of Poplar in Mexico City (1993).<ref name=\"SP\"/>\n\n==Reviews==\n\nDistinguished critics have written about her work, such as  [[Salvador Elizondo]], Miguel \u00c1ngel Mu\u00f1oz, Santiago Espinosa de los Monteros, Alberto Blanco and Gonzalo Velez. According to Salvador Elizondo, art critic from [[Milenio]] newspaper, ''these paintings represent the point at which the movement and life balance are  expressive forms and unique heritage. Sandra Pani's paintings exhibited in her exposition of 1994 (Gallery Lourdes Chumacero) presume that had surfaced since then in this artist boldly pursued the ideal of Leonardo and D\u00fcrer: \"Penetrating geomentr\u00eda mechanisms and in the body, but in a less categorical, freer, more lyrical''.\" <ref name=\"Salvador Elizondo\">{{cite book |title= Sandra Pani Bistur\u00eda \u00d3ptico |last= Elizondo |first= Salvador |authorlink= |year=1998 |publisher= departamento de publicaciones del Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes, CONACULTA |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> She is an artist whose soul is for the moment obsessed with the body as a complex or synthesis of parts  or figures that integrate  pictorial  poetics. They are so to speak, anatomical inventions, variations or fantasies. These paintings aspire to capture the essence of the human body, an essence that could only be formal; a yearning for the body to be soul and for the soul to be made visible by a sign.<ref name=\"Salvador Elizondo milenio\">{{cite news |title=Dibujar es pensar |first= Salvador |last= Elizondo |newspaper= Milenio |date= 2003-11-23 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Miguel \u00c1ngel Mu\u00f1oz art critic from [[El Financiero]] newspaper,  ''Sandra Pani belongs to a generation of artists that has considered painting as something exhausted, old fashioned and, to a certain extent, dead''. It is certainly significant that Pani\u00b4s abstract, semi-figurative and almost classical approach to painting should have arisen at the peak of the conceptual and minimalist movements. Still, it might be argued that its conviction springs precisely from those apparently inauspicious beginnings. Pani\u00b4s works can be said to be figurative with certain poetical abstract accents. They are rooted in 20th-century painters such as Picasso, Morandi, Matisse and Giacometti, and in some modernist artists, especially North American abstract painters.<ref name=\"Miguel \u00c1ngel Mu\u00f1oz\">{{cite news |title=La geograf\u00eda del cuerpo, los abstractos acentos po\u00e9ticos |first= Miguel \u00c1ngel |last= Mu\u00f1oz |newspaper= El Financiero |date= 12/11/ 2003 }}</ref> In the [[La Jornada]] newspaper, Mu\u00f1oz states that Sandra Pani's drawings at the Festival Internacional Cervantino on its 39th edition in 2011 were in effect a decantation, which runs and drips as something that falls within a long time to stay only with the essence. An almost nothing, which is the record of almost everything. An atmosphere. A sign.<ref name=\"Miguel \u00c1ngel Mu\u00f1oz2\">{{cite news |title= 39 Festival Internacional Cervantino |first= Miguel \u00c1ngel |last= Mu\u00f1oz |newspaper= La Jornada |date= 1/04/ 2011 }}</ref>\n\nSantiago Espinosa de los Monteros from [[Colonia Roma#Casa Lamm|Casa Lamm Gallery]],says that  ''using only a few lines she describes moments in an almost Oriental style, drawing simple and almost rudimentary sketches over her two-dimensional medium in a way that bares the work - unbridling it from anything that might stop it from achieving total expression. Her work is free from the narrative temptation, which often prevents us from grasping a missing story that becomes manifest by its very absence.'' In her work a pendular movement can be perceived  that comes and goes from abstraction to figuration, as if from one extreme to the other. It briefly stops at both ends, but does not stay at either. The work is at the road thus treaded -in a two-way fashion- by two paths that cross each other constantly and go from figure to non-figure. Between them lies emptiness transformed into an expressive possibility -having become a body, as it were- making evident something that has never been there.<ref name=\"Santiago Espinosa\">{{cite book |title= El cuarto tiempo |last= Espinosa de los Monteros |first= Santiago |year=2002 |publisher=  Galer\u00eda de Casa Lamm |location=Mexico City }}</ref>\n\nAlberto Blanco of the journal [[Artes de M\u00e9xico]] describes her works as \"painted bodies, showing all their anatomical structures, their stroke, spot, and touch of color write her story, It is precisely in the surface of Sandra Pani\u00b4s paintings that the entrails of the represented body are surprisingly turned into trees and flowers, thanks to the transforming power of the poetic logic.

At this time Louth consisted of three sub-kingdoms, each subject to separate over-kingdoms: [[Conaille Muirtheimne|Conaille]] ([[Ulaid]]h); Fir Rois ([[Airgialla]]); and, the Fir Arda Ciannachta ([[Kingdom of Mide|Midhe]]). The whole area became part of the O'Carroll Kingdom of Airgialla (Oriel) early in the 12th century under [[Donnchad Ua Cerbaill]]. At the same time, the area was removed from the diocese of Armagh and the [[episcopal see]] of the [[Bishop of Clogher|Diocese of Airg\u00edalla or Clogher]] was transferred to Louth ''c.'' 1130\u20131190.\n\nA number of historic sites are in the county, including religious sites at [[Monasterboice]], [[Mellifont Abbey]] and the [[Magdalene Tower, Drogheda|St Mary Magdalene Dominican Friary]].\n\nThe Normans occupied the Louth area in the 1180s, and it became known as 'English' Oriel, to distinguish it from the remainder ('Irish' Oriel) which remained in Irish hands. The latter became the [[McMahon]] lordship of Oriel of [[County Monaghan]].\n\nIn the early 14th century, the Scottish army of [[Edward Bruce]] was repulsed from [[Drogheda]]. Edward was finally defeated, losing his claim to the [[High King of Ireland|High Kingship of Ireland]] along with his life, in the [[Battle of Faughart]] near Dundalk, by a chiefly local force led by [[John de Bermingham, 1st Earl of Louth|John de Bermingham]].\n\nIn 1189, a royal charter was granted to [[Dundalk]] after a Norman nobleman named [[Bertram de Verdun]] erected a manor house at Castletown Mount. Later in 1412, a royal charter was granted to Drogheda. This charter unified the towns of Drogheda-in-[[Kingdom of Meath|Meath]] and Drogheda-in-[[Airg\u00edalla|Uriel (Louth)]] as a [[County Corporate|County in its own right]], styled as \u2018the County of the town of Drogheda\u2019.<ref name=\"Johnston 1826 37\">{{cite book|last=Johnston |first=L.

[[Siege of Drogheda|Oliver Cromwell attacked Drogheda in 1649]] slaughtering the Royalist garrison and hundreds of the town's citizens. Towards the end of the same century, the armies of the warring Kings, [[James II]] and [[William III of England|William (III) of Orange]], faced off in south Louth during the build-up to the [[Battle of the Boyne]]; the battle was fought 3&nbsp;km west from Drogheda. Drogheda held for James under Lord Iveagh, but surrendered to William the day after the battle of the Boyne.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn 1798, the leaders of the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] included Bartholomew Teeling, John Byrne, and Patrick Byrne, all from Castletown; Anthony Marmion from Louth Town and Dundalk, Anthony McCann from Corderry; Nicholas and Thomas Markey from Barmeath, and Arthur McKeown, John Warren, and James McAllister from Cambricville. They were betrayed by informers, notably a Dr. Conlan, who came from Dundalk, and an ''agent provocateur'' called Sam Turner, from Newry. Several leaders were hanged.\n\nThe priest and scientist [[Nicholas Callan]] (1799\u20131864) was from Darver.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n| state=collapsed\n|1600|3454\n|1610|6787\n|1653|8527\n|1659|9690\n|1821|119129\n|1831|124846\n|1841|128240\n|1851|107662\n|1861|90713\n|1871|84021\n|1881|77684\n|1891|71038\n|1901|65820\n|1911|63665\n|1926|62739\n|1936|64339\n|1946|66194\n|1951|68771\n|1956|69194\n|1961|67378\n|1966|69519\n|1971|74951\n|1979|86135\n|1981|88514\n|1986|91810\n|1991|90724\n|1996|92166\n|2002|101821\n|2006|111267\n|2011|122897\n|2016|128884\n||footnote=<ref name=cso2016/><ref>For 1653 and 1659 figures from Civil Survey Census of those years, Paper of Mr Hardinge to Royal Irish Academy 14 March 1865.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/census|title=Server Error 404 - CSO - Central Statistics Office|author=|date=|website=www.cso.ie|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507023856/http://www.histpop.org/|url-status=dead|title=HISTPOP.ORG - Home|archivedate=7 May 2016|website=www.histpop.org}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census NISRA - Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (c) 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217095720/http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census |date=17 February 2012 }}.

Historically, the placename has had various spellings; \"Lugmad\", \"Lughmhaigh\", and \"Lughmhadh\" (see [[County Louth Historic Names|Historic Names List]], for full listing). ''L\u00fa'' is the modern [[Irish orthography|simplified spelling]].\n\nThe county is steeped in myth, legend and history, and is a setting in the [[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge]]. Later it saw the influence of the [[Viking]]s, as seen in the name of [[Carlingford Lough]]. They also established a [[longphort]] at [[Annagassan]] in the ninth century. At this time Louth consisted of three sub-kingdoms, each subject to separate over-kingdoms: [[Conaille Muirtheimne|Conaille]] ([[Ulaid]]h); Fir Rois ([[Airgialla]]); and, the Fir Arda Ciannachta ([[Kingdom of Mide|Midhe]]). The whole area became part of the O'Carroll Kingdom of Airgialla (Oriel) early in the 12th century under [[Donnchad Ua Cerbaill]]. At the same time, the area was removed from the diocese of Armagh and the [[episcopal see]] of the [[Bishop of Clogher|Diocese of Airg\u00edalla or Clogher]] was transferred to Louth ''c.'' 1130-1190.\n\nA number of historic sites are in the county, including religious sites at [[Monasterboice]], [[Mellifont Abbey]] and the [[Magdalene Tower, Drogheda|St Mary Magdalene Dominican Friary]].\n\nThe Normans occupied the Louth area in the 1180s, and it became known as 'English' Oriel, to distinguish it from the remainder ('Irish' Oriel) which remained in Irish hands. The latter became the [[McMahon]] lordship of Oriel of [[County Monaghan]].\n\nIn the early 14th century, the Scottish army of [[Edward Bruce]] was repulsed from [[Drogheda]]. Edward was finally defeated, losing his claim to the [[High King of Ireland|High Kingship of Ireland]] along with his life, in the [[Battle of Faughart]] near Dundalk, by a chiefly local force led by [[John de Bermingham, 1st Earl of Louth|John de Bermingham]].\n\nIn 1189, a royal charter was granted to [[Dundalk]] after a Norman nobleman named [[Bertram de Verdun]] erected a manor house at Castletown Mount. Later in 1412, a royal charter was granted to Drogheda. This charter unified the towns of Drogheda-in-[[Kingdom of Meath|Meath]] and Drogheda-in-[[Airg\u00edalla|Uriel (Louth)]] as a [[County Corporate|County in its own right]], styled as \u2018the County of the town of Drogheda\u2019.<ref name=\"Johnston 1826 37\">{{cite book|last=Johnston |first=L.

[[Siege of Drogheda|Oliver Cromwell attacked Drogheda in 1649]] slaughtering the Royalist garrison and hundreds of the town's citizens. Towards the end of the same century, the armies of the warring Kings, [[James II]] and [[William III of England|William (III) of Orange]], faced off in south Louth during the build-up to the [[Battle of the Boyne]]; the battle was fought 3&nbsp;km west from Drogheda. Drogheda held for James under Lord Iveagh, but surrendered to William the day after the battle of the Boyne.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn 1798, the leaders of the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] included Bartholomew Teeling, John Byrne, and Patrick Byrne, all from Castletown; Anthony Marmion from Louth Town and Dundalk, Anthony McCann from Corderry; Nicholas and Thomas Markey from Barmeath, and Arthur McKeown, John Warren, and James McAllister from Cambricville. They were betrayed by informers, notably a Dr. Conlan, who came from Dundalk, and an ''agent provocateur'' called Sam Turner, from Newry. Several leaders were hanged.\n\nThe priest and scientist [[Nicholas Callan]] (1799\u20131864) was from Darver.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n| state=collapsed\n|1600|3454\n|1610|6787\n|1653|8527\n|1659|9690\n|1821|119129\n|1831|124846\n|1841|128240\n|1851|107662\n|1861|90713\n|1871|84021\n|1881|77684\n|1891|71038\n|1901|65820\n|1911|63665\n|1926|62739\n|1936|64339\n|1946|66194\n|1951|68771\n|1956|69194\n|1961|67378\n|1966|69519\n|1971|74951\n|1979|86135\n|1981|88514\n|1986|91810\n|1991|90724\n|1996|92166\n|2002|101821\n|2006|111267\n|2011|122897\n|2016|128884\n||footnote=<ref name=cso2016/><ref>For 1653 and 1659 figures from Civil Survey Census of those years, Paper of Mr Hardinge to Royal Irish Academy 14 March 1865.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/census|title=Server Error 404 - CSO - Central Statistics Office|author=|date=|website=www.cso.ie|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507023856/http://www.histpop.org/|url-status=dead|title=HISTPOP.ORG - Home|archivedate=7 May 2016|website=www.histpop.org}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census NISRA - Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (c) 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217095720/http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census |date=17 February 2012 }}.

Aristarchus had known that in a given circle the ratio of arc to chord decreases from 180\u00b0 to 0\u00b0, tending toward a limit of 1.

Even numbers were written out in words rather than symbols! It is quite unlikely that al-Khwarizmi knew of the work of Diophantus, but he must have been familiar with at least the astronomical and computational portions of Brahmagupta; yet neither al-Khwarizmi nor other Arabic scholars made use of syncopation or of negative numbers.|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmathema00boye/page/228}}</ref><ref name=\"John Derbyshire For Diophantus\">{{cite book|first=John|last=Derbyshire|authorlink=John Derbyshire|title=Unknown Quantity: A Real And Imaginary History of Algebra|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|year=2006|chapter=The Father of Algebra|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780309096577/page/31 31]|isbn=978-0-309-09657-7|quote=Diophantus, the father of algebra, in whose honor I have named this chapter, lived in Alexandria, in Roman Egypt, in either the 1st, the 2nd, or the 3rd century CE.|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780309096577/page/31}}</ref>\n| Full exposition of solving [[quadratic equation]]s in his ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Al-Jabr]]'' and recognized algebra as an independent discipline.<br />First use of symbolism ([[History of algebra#Diophantine algebra|syncopation]]) in his ''[[Arithmetica]]''.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| '''[[Algebraic topology]]'''\n| [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]]<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Topology|year=1999|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780444823755|editor=Ioan Mackenzie James|page=544|quote=Poincar\u00e9: the founder of algebraic topology}}</ref>\n| Published ''[[Analysis Situs (paper)|Analysis Situs]]'' in 1895,<ref>Poincar\u00e9, Henri, \"Analysis situs\", Journal de l'\u00c9cole Polytechnique ser 2, 1 (1895) pp. 1\u2013123</ref> introducing the concepts of [[homotopy]] and [[homology (mathematics)|homology]], which are now considered part of [[algebraic topology]].\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| '''[[Mathematical analysis|Analysis]]'''\n| [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]]<ref>p. 750, ''Rudiments of Mathematics Part 1'', M.

Aristarchus had known that in a given circle the ratio of arc to chord decreases from 180\u00b0 to 0\u00b0, tending toward a limit of 1.

Prior to the [[partition of Ireland]], it was one of the [[counties of Ireland|counties]] of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] from 1613 onward and then of the [[United Kingdom]] after the [[Acts of Union 1800]]. Adjoining the north-west shore of [[Lough Neagh]], the county covers an area of 2,074&nbsp;km\u00b2 (801 sq mi) and today has a population of about 247,132.\n\nSince 1972, the counties in Northern Ireland, including Londonderry, have no longer been used by the state as part of the local administration. Following further reforms in 2015, the area is now governed under three different districts; [[Derry and Strabane]], [[Causeway Coast and Glens]] and [[Mid-Ulster District|Mid-Ulster]]. Despite no longer being used for local government and administrative purposes, it is sometimes used in a cultural context in [[All-Ireland]] sporting and cultural events (i.e. [[Derry GAA]]).\n\nSince 1981, it has become one of four counties in Northern Ireland that has a [[Irish Catholic|Catholic]] majority (55.56% according to the 2001 Census<ref name=\"NISRA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/Census/pdf/Key%20Statistics%20ReportTables.pdf|title=NISRA - Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (c) 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127021255/http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/Census/pdf/Key%20Statistics%20ReportTables.pdf|archivedate=27 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>), with 57% of the Catholic population residing within [[Derry City Council]].<ref name=\"NISRA\"/> The [[county flower]] is the [[Purple Saxifrage]].<ref>[http://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/plantlife-discovering-plants-county-flowers.html County flowers in Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214131539/http://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/plantlife-discovering-plants-county-flowers.html |date=14 February 2006 }} www.plantlife.org.uk</ref>\n\n== Name ==\nThe place name ''Derry'' is an [[anglicisation]] of the old Irish ''Daire''<ref>{{cite book|last=Delanoy|first=Werner|title=Towards a Dialogic Anglistics|publisher=LIT Verlag|year=2007|page=38|isbn=978-3-8258-0549-4|display-authors=etal}}</ref> (Modern Irish ''Doire''<ref name=tearma>{{cite web | url = http://www.tearma.ie/Search.aspx?term=doire | title = doire | work = t\u00e9arma.ie \u2013 Dictionary of Irish Terms | publisher = [[Foras na Gaeilge]] and [[Dublin City University]] | accessdate = 18 November 2016}}</ref>), meaning \"oak-grove\" or \"oak-wood\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Blackie|first=Christina|title=Geographical Etymology|publisher=Marton Press|year=2010|page=61|isbn=978-1-4455-8286-3}}</ref>\n\nAs with the city, its name is subject to the [[Derry/Londonderry name dispute]], with the form \"Londonderry\" generally preferred by [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] and \"Derry\" by [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceps.eu/Article.php?article_id=206|title=Centre for European Policy Studies, accessed 6 October 2007|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"Maiden\">{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1588|title=The Walled City Experience|publisher=Northern Ireland Tourist Board|accessdate=4 September 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420182750/http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1588|archivedate=20 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4887352.stm BBC News: Court to Rule on City Name] 7 April 2006</ref><ref>''City name row lands in High Court'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6213890.stm BBC News]</ref><ref>{{cite BAILII |litigants=Derry City Council: Re Application for Judicial Review |link= |country=nie |court=NIHC |division=QB |year=2007 |num=5 |para= |eucase= |parallelcite= |date= |courtname= |juris= }}</ref> British authorities use the name \"Londonderry\", while \"Derry\" is used by the [[Republic of Ireland]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cannon on Derry City Walls SMC 2007.jpg|220px|thumbnail|A cannon sits atop the historic Derry Walls, which look over [[Derry|Derry City]].]]\n[[File:1837Londonderry.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Map of County Londonderry, 1837]]\n\n===Pre-historic===\n[[Mount Sandel Mesolithic site|Mountsandel]] located near Coleraine in County Londonderry is \"perhaps the oldest recorded settlement within Ireland\".<ref>A.E.P.

These councils were: [[Derry City Council|Londonderry City Council]] (renamed Derry City Council in 1984), [[Limavady Borough Council]], and [[Magherafelt District Council]], most of [[Coleraine Borough Council]], and part of [[Cookstown District Council]]. After a reduction in the number of councils in Northern Ireland in 2011, County Londonderry is divided into three cross-county councils: [[Causeway Coast and Glens]], [[Derry and Strabane]], and [[Mid-Ulster District]].\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Downhill Railway Runnel - geograph.org.uk - 1197950.jpg|thumb|Downhill Tunnels near [[Castlerock railway station]].]]\n\n[[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink]] provides a [[Northern Ireland Railways]] service in the county, linking [[Londonderry Waterside railway station]] to [[Coleraine railway station]] (with a branch to {{stnlnk|Portrush}} on the [[Coleraine\u2013Portrush railway line]]) and onwards into County Antrim to [[Belfast Central railway station|Belfast Central]] and [[Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station|Belfast Great Victoria Street]] on the [[Belfast-Derry railway line]].\n\nThere is also the [[Foyle Valley Railway]], a museum in [[Derry]] with some rolling stock from both the [[County Donegal Railway]] and the [[Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway]], and is located on the site of the former [[Londonderry Foyle Road railway station]]. The [[Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway]] continued as a private bus company based in the city but operating predominantly in [[County Donegal]] until it closed in 2014. Bus services are now provided by [[Ulsterbus]].\n\n== Education ==\nGovernment-funded education up to secondary school level is administered by the [[Education Authority]] (EA), sponsored by the [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Department of Education]]. The EA is divided into sub-regions:\n\n* Western region: Derry, Limavady;\n* North Eastern region: Coleraine, Magherafelt;\n* Southern region: Cookstown.\n\nFor Catholic grant-maintained schools administration is by the Derry Diocesan Education Office.\n\nTwo major centres of the [[University of Ulster]] are in the county, including its headquarters at [[University of Ulster at Coleraine|Coleraine]] and the [[Magee College|Magee Campus]] in Derry.\n\n== Sport ==\n[[File:Tammet\u00f5ru.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The oak leaf which represents the county's [[List of Irish county nicknames|nickname]].]]\nIn [[Gaelic Athletic Association|Gaelic games]], the [[GAA county]] of [[Derry GAA|Derry]] is more or less coterminous with the former administrative county of Londonderry, although teams from the neighbouring counties of Tyrone, Donegal and Antrim have occasionally played in Derry competitions, and vice versa. The Derry teams wear the colours red and white. There are many club teams competing in up to five leagues and three championships. The county team has won one [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] (in [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 1993|1993]]) and five [[National Football League (Ireland)|National League titles]].

Prior to the [[partition of Ireland]], it was one of the [[counties of Ireland|counties]] of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] from 1613 onward and then of the [[United Kingdom]] after the [[Acts of Union 1800]]. Adjoining the north-west shore of [[Lough Neagh]], the county covers an area of 2,074&nbsp;km\u00b2 (801 sq mi) and today has a population of about 247,132.\n\nSince 1972, the counties in Northern Ireland, including Londonderry, have no longer been used by the state as part of the local administration. Following further reforms in 2015, the area is now governed under three different districts; [[Derry and Strabane]], [[Causeway Coast and Glens]] and [[Mid-Ulster District|Mid-Ulster]]. Despite no longer being used for local government and administrative purposes, it is sometimes used in a cultural context in [[All-Ireland]] sporting and cultural events (i.e. [[Derry GAA]]).\n\nSince 1981, it has become one of four counties in Northern Ireland that has a [[Irish Catholic|Catholic]] majority (55.56% according to the 2001 Census<ref name=\"NISRA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/Census/pdf/Key%20Statistics%20ReportTables.pdf|title=NISRA - Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (c) 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127021255/http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/Census/pdf/Key%20Statistics%20ReportTables.pdf|archivedate=27 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>), with 57% of the Catholic population residing within [[Derry City Council]].<ref name=\"NISRA\"/> The [[county flower]] is the [[Purple Saxifrage]].<ref>[http://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/plantlife-discovering-plants-county-flowers.html County flowers in Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214131539/http://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/plantlife-discovering-plants-county-flowers.html |date=14 February 2006 }} www.plantlife.org.uk</ref>\n\n== Name ==\nThe place name ''Derry'' is an [[anglicisation]] of the old Irish ''Daire''<ref>{{cite book|last=Delanoy|first=Werner|title=Towards a Dialogic Anglistics|publisher=LIT Verlag|year=2007|page=38|isbn=978-3-8258-0549-4|display-authors=etal}}</ref> (Modern Irish ''Doire''<ref name=tearma>{{cite web | url = http://www.tearma.ie/Search.aspx?term=doire | title = doire | work = t\u00e9arma.ie \u2013 Dictionary of Irish Terms | publisher = [[Foras na Gaeilge]] and [[Dublin City University]] | accessdate = 18 November 2016}}</ref>), meaning \"oak-grove\" or \"oak-wood\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Blackie|first=Christina|title=Geographical Etymology|publisher=Marton Press|year=2010|page=61|isbn=978-1-4455-8286-3}}</ref>\n\nAs with the city, its name is subject to the [[Derry/Londonderry name dispute]], with the form \"Londonderry\" generally preferred by [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] and \"Derry\" by [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceps.eu/Article.php?article_id=206|title=Centre for European Policy Studies, accessed 6 October 2007|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"Maiden\">{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1588|title=The Walled City Experience|publisher=Northern Ireland Tourist Board|accessdate=4 September 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420182750/http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1588|archivedate=20 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4887352.stm BBC News: Court to Rule on City Name] 7 April 2006</ref><ref>''City name row lands in High Court'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6213890.stm BBC News]</ref><ref>{{cite BAILII |litigants=Derry City Council: Re Application for Judicial Review |link= |country=nie |court=NIHC |division=QB |year=2007 |num=5 |para= |eucase= |parallelcite= |date= |courtname= |juris= }}</ref> British authorities use the name \"Londonderry\", while \"Derry\" is used by the [[Republic of Ireland]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cannon on Derry City Walls SMC 2007.jpg|220px|thumbnail|A cannon sits atop the historic Derry Walls, which look over [[Derry|Derry City]].]]\n[[File:1837Londonderry.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Map of County Londonderry, 1837]]\n\n===Pre-historic===\n[[Mount Sandel Mesolithic site|Mountsandel]] located near Coleraine in County Londonderry is \"perhaps the oldest recorded settlement within Ireland\".<ref>A.E.P.
