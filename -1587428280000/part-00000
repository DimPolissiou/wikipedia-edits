The city is home to [[Kirtland Air Force Base]], [[Sandia National Laboratories]], [[Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute]], [[Presbyterian Health Services]], and both the [[University of New Mexico]] and [[Central New Mexico Community College]] have their main campuses in the city. Albuquerque is the center of the New Mexico Technology Corridor, a concentration of high-tech institutions, including the metropolitan area being the location of [[Intel]]'s [[List of Intel manufacturing sites|Fab 11X]] In [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]] and a [[Facebook]] Data Center in [[Los Lunas, New Mexico|Los Lunas]], Albuquerque was also the founding location of [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]] and [[Microsoft]].

Located in [[Downtown Albuquerque]] are historic theaters such as the [[KiMo Theater]], and near the [[Albuquerque Plaza|Civic Plaza]] is the [[Al Hurricane]] Pavilion and [[Albuquerque Convention Center]] with its Kiva Auditorium. Due to its population size, the metropolitan area regularly receives most national and international music concerts, [[Broadway show]]s, and other large traveling events, as well as [[New Mexico music]], and [[Music of New Mexico|other local music performances]].\n\nLikewise, due to the metropolitan size, it is home to a diverse restaurant scene from various [[global cuisine]]s, and the state's distinct [[New Mexican cuisine]]. Being the focus of the [[Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District]] gives an agricultural contrast, along [[acequia]]s, to the otherwise heavily urban setting of the city. Crops such as [[New Mexico chile]] are grown along the entire Rio Grande, the red or green chile pepper is a staple of the aforementioned New Mexican cuisine. The Albuquerque metro is a major contributor of the [[Middle Rio Grande Valley AVA]] with [[New Mexico wine]] produced at several vineyards, it is also home to several [[List of breweries in New Mexico|New Mexican breweries]].

In 1902, the famous Alvarado Hotel was built adjacent to the new passenger depot, and it remained a symbol of the city until it was razed in 1970 to make room for a parking lot. In 2002, the [[Alvarado Transportation Center]] was built on the site in a manner resembling the old landmark. The large metro station functions as the downtown headquarters for the city's transit department. It also serves as an intermodal hub for local buses, [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] buses, [[Amtrak]] passenger trains, and the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express|Rail Runner]] commuter rail line.\n\nNew Mexico's dry climate brought many [[tuberculosis]] patients to the city in search of a cure during the early 20th century, and several sanitaria sprang up on the [[West Mesa]] to serve them. Presbyterian Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital, two of the largest hospitals in the Southwest, had their beginnings during this period.

''Sand\u00eda'' is Spanish for \"[[watermelon]]\", and is popularly believed to be a reference to the brilliant coloration of the mountains at sunset: bright pink (melon meat) and green (melon rind). The pink is due to large exposures of [[granodiorite]] cliffs, and the green is due to large swaths of [[conifer]] forests. However, Robert Julyan notes in ''The Place Names of New Mexico'', \"the most likely explanation is the one believed by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] Indians: the Spaniards, when they encountered the Pueblo in 1540, called it Sandia, because they thought the squash growing there were watermelons, and the name Sandia soon was transferred to the mountains east of the pueblo.\"<ref name=\"julyan\">Robert Julyan, ''The Place Names of New Mexico'' (revised edition), UNM Press, 1998.</ref> He also notes that the Sandia Pueblo Indians call the mountain ''Bien Mur'', \"big mountain.\"<ref name=\"julyan\"/>\n\nThe Sandia foothills, on the west side of the mountains, have soils derived from that same rock material with varying sizes of decomposed granite, mixed with areas of clay and [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]] (a [[calcium carbonate]] deposit common in the arid southwestern USA), along with some exposed [[granite]] bedrock.\n\nBelow the foothills, the area usually called the \"Northeast Heights\" consists of a mix of clay and [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]] soils, overlaying a layer of decomposed granite, resulting from long-term outwash of that material from the adjacent mountains. This [[bajada (geography)|bajada]] is quite noticeable when driving into Albuquerque from the north or south, due to its fairly uniform slope from the mountains' edge downhill to the valley. Sand hills are scattered along the I-25 corridor and directly above the Rio Grande Valley, forming the lower end of the Heights.\n\nThe Rio Grande Valley, due to long-term shifting of the actual river channel, contains layers and areas of soils varying between [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]], clay, loam, and even some sand. It is the only part of Albuquerque where the [[water table]] often lies close to the surface, sometimes less than {{convert|10|ft|m}}.\n\nThe last significant area of Albuquerque geologically is the [[West Mesa]]: this is the elevated land west of the Rio Grande, including \"West Bluff\", the sandy terrace immediately west and above the river, and the rather sharply defined volcanic escarpment above and west of most of the developed city. The west mesa commonly has soils often referred to as \"blow sand\", along with occasional clay and caliche and even basalt, nearing the escarpment.\n\n===Potential and former native flora===\nFlora or vegetation surrounding the built portions of the city are typical of their desert southwestern and interior west setting, within the varied elevations and terrain. The limits are by significant urbanization, including much infill development occurring in the last quarter of the twentieth century.\n\nSandy soils include scrub and mesa vegetation such as sand sagebrush (''Artemisia filifolia''), fourwing saltbush (''Atriplex canescens''). Some similar grass and seasonal wildflower species occur that also occur in areas east of the Rio Grande, but in much lower densities. Sparsely as well, sandy soil grasses occur such as Indian ricegrass (''Oryzopsis hymenoides''), sand dropseed (''Sporobolus cryptandrus''), and mesa dropseed (''Sporobolus flexuosus''). Arroyos contain desert willow (''Chilopsis linearis'') while breaks and the prominent volcanic escarpment include threeleaf sumac with less frequent stands of oneseed juniper (''Juniperus monosperma''), netleaf hackberry (''Celtis reticulata''), mariola (''Parthenium incanum''), and beebrush or oreganillo (''Aloysia wrightii'').

In the lower foothills of the Sandia Mountains loose or granitic soils help provide habitat for other species, such as feather dalea (''Dalea formosa''), mariola (''Parthenium incanum''), and beebrush or oreganillo (''Aloysia wrightii'').<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npsnm.org/pdfs/Sandia_cl_Sivinski.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902003239/https://www.npsnm.org/pdfs/Sandia_cl_Sivinski.pdf |archive-date=September 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSoaptree (''Yucca elata'') and broom dalea (''Psorothamnus scoparius'') are currently found or were once existing on sand hills and breaks on both sides of the Rio Grande Valley, roughly below the present-day locations of the Petroglyph Escarpment west of Coors Road and along Interstate 25 south of Sunport Boulevard.\n\nThe Rio Grande Valley proper bisects Albuquerque, and it has been urbanized the longest of all areas of the city. Some botanists and longtime residents <ref>personal correspondence with Dave Ferguson, 2004 and earlier</ref> recall riparian vegetation, including screwbean mesquite or tornillo (''Prosopis pubescens''), Gooding's willow (''Salix goodingii''), and saint sacaton (''Sporobulus wrightii''). The present bosque or gallery forest of Rio Grande cottonwood (''Populus deltoides var. wislizeni'') and coyote willow (''Salix exigua'') is theorized to have been more savannah-like, prior to replanting in the 1930s. Grass and low cactus cover of many areas is typical of a broader region of the intermontane west riparian zones, such as saltgrass (''Distychilis spp.'') and alkali sacaton (''Sporobulus airoides''). Discontinuous, small stands of New Mexico olive (''Forestiera pubescens var. neomexicana''), Arizona walnut (''Juglans major''), and Arizona ash (''Fraxinus velutina'') can be seen near bosque areas and near former river bends in central New Mexico just north and south of the Albuquerque city limits in the Corrales bosque and along former channels of the Rio Grande in Valencia and Socorro counties. The forest now has a large proportion of non-native species including [[Ulmus pumila|Siberian elm]], [[Elaeagnus angustifolia|Russian olive]], [[Tamarix|saltcedar]], [[Morus (plant)|mulberries]], [[Ailanthus altissima|Ailanthus]], and [[Saccharum ravennae|ravenna grass]]. Some restoration to native species is occurring, similar to the limited species of ''Populus'' and ''Salix'' used in the 1930s.\n\nOne prominent species of native Mountainous trees is the [[pinyon pine|pi\u00f1on pine]]. At the east end of the city, the Sandia foothills receive about 50 percent more precipitation than most of the city, and with granitic, coarse soils, rock outcrops, and boulders dominant, they have a greater and different diversity of flora in the form of savanna and chaparral, dominated by lower and middle zones of New Mexico Mountains vegetation, with a slight orientation at lower elevations. Dominant plants include shrub or desert live oak (''Quercus turbinella''), gray oak (''Quercus grisea''), hairy mountain mahogany (''Cercocarpus breviflorus''), oneseed juniper (''Juniperus monosperma''), pi\u00f1on (''Pinus edulis''), threeleaf sumac (''Rhus trilobata''), Engelmann prickly pear (''Opuntia engelmannii''), juniper prickly pear (''Opuntia hystricina var. juniperiana''), and beargrass (''Nolina greenei'', formerly considered ''Nolina texana''). Similar grasses occur that are native to the eastern half of the city, but often of a higher density owing to increased precipitation. The foothills of Albuquerque are much less urbanized, the vegetation altered or removed than anywhere else in the city, though the lower areas have been mostly developed in a more dense suburban pattern in mostly developed communities including North Albuquerque Acres, Tanoan, High Desert, Glenwood Hills, Embudo Hills, Supper Rock, and Four Hills.\n\n===Native and other fauna===\nAn iconic bird often seen in Albuquerque is the [[greater roadrunner]]. Other birds include the common raven, American crow, great-tailed grackle, Gambel's and scaled quail, several species of hummingbirds, house finch, pigeon, mourning dove, [[White-winged dove|white wing]] and [[Eurasian collared dove|European collared doves]] (both recent appearances), curve-billed thrasher, pinyon jay, and Cooper's, Swainson's, and red-tail hawks. The valley hosts [[sandhill crane]]s each winter.\n\nWithin city limits, the [[southwestern fence lizard]] and [[Aspidoscelis|whiptails]] are common. Snakes include the [[Common garter snake|New Mexico garter snake]] and the [[bullsnake]] in the [[Bosque|Rio Grande Bosque]], and at the edges of the city, the venomous [[Western diamondback rattlesnake]]. [[Woodhouse's toad|Woodhouse toads]] and non-native [[American bullfrog|bullfrogs]] are common around the Rio Grande. Retention ponds within the city often serve as breeding pools for [[New Mexico spadefoot toad]]s and [[Notostraca|tadpole shrimp]] (\"Triops\").\n\nCommonly seen mammals include the [[coyote]], [[rock squirrel]], [[Gunnison's prairie dog]], [[desert cottontail]], and [[black-tailed jackrabbit]]. Striped skunks, raccoons, and several mouse species can be found in the city, and mule deer and [[Pack rat|woodrats]] occur in the foothills. The broader area is home to bobcat, black bear, and mountain lion, and is at the north end of the range of the [[ring-tailed cat|ringtail]] and [[Collared peccary|javelina]].\n\nLarger arthropods include the [[Neotibicen dealbatus|plains cicada]], [[Mastigoproctus giganteus|vinegaroon]], [[Scolopendra polymorpha|desert centipede]], [[Hyles lineata|white-lined sphynx]] (hummingbird moth), [[Papilio multicaudata|two-tailed swallowtail]], [[Figeater beetle|fig beetle]], [[Stagmomantis limbata|New Mexico mantis]], and [[Pogonomyrmex|harvester ant]].\n\n===Cityscape===\n{{wide image|Albuquerque_pano_sunset.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of the city of Albuquerque}}\n\n====Quadrants====\nAlbuquerque is geographically divided into four [[Address (geography)#Quadrants|quadrants]] that are officially part of mailing addresses. They are NE (northeast), NW (northwest), SE (southeast), and SW (southwest). The north-south dividing line is Central Avenue (the path that [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] took through the city), and the east-west dividing line is the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express|Rail Runner]] tracks.\n\n=====Northeast=====\n\nThis quadrant has been experiencing a housing expansion since the late 1950s. It abuts the base of the Sandia Mountains and contains portions of the foothills neighborhoods, which are significantly higher, in elevation and price range, than the rest of the city. Running from Central Avenue and the railroad tracks to the [[Sandia Peak Tramway|Sandia Peak Aerial Tram]], this is the largest quadrant both geographically and by population. Martineztown, the University of New Mexico, the [[Maxwell Museum of Anthropology]], Nob Hill, the Uptown area which includes three shopping malls ([[Coronado Center]], ABQ Uptown, and Winrock Town Center), Hoffmantown, Journal Center, [[Cliff's Amusement Park]], and Balloon Fiesta Park are all in this quadrant.\n\nSome of the most affluent neighborhoods in the city are here, including: [[High Desert, Albuquerque, New Mexico|High Desert]], Tanoan, Sandia Heights, and North Albuquerque Acres. Parts of Sandia Heights and North Albuquerque Acres are outside the city limits proper. A few houses in the farthest reach of this quadrant lie in the [[Cibola National Forest]], just over the line into [[Sandoval County, New Mexico|Sandoval County]].\n\n=====Northwest=====\n[[File:KiMo Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|KiMo Theatre in Downtown]]\n\nThis quadrant contains historic [[Old Town Albuquerque]], which dates to the 18th century, as well as the [[Indian Pueblo Cultural Center]]. The area has a mixture of commercial districts and low to high-income neighborhoods. Northwest Albuquerque includes the largest section of [[Downtown Albuquerque|Downtown]], [[Rio Grande Nature Center State Park]] and the [[Bosque]] (\"woodlands\"), Petroglyph National Monument, [[Double Eagle II Airport]], the Paradise Hills neighborhood, Taylor Ranch, and [[Cottonwood Mall (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Cottonwood Mall]].\n\nThis quadrant also contains the [[North Valley, New Mexico|North Valley]] settlement, outside the city limits, which has some expensive homes and small ranches along the [[Rio Grande]]. The city of Albuquerque engulfs the village of [[Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, New Mexico|Los Ranchos de Albuquerque]]. A small portion of the rapidly developing area on the west side of the river south of the Petroglyphs, known as the \"[[West Mesa]]\" or \"Westside\", consisting primarily of traditional residential subdivisions, also extends into this quadrant. The city proper is bordered on the north by the North Valley, the village of [[Corrales, New Mexico|Corrales]], and the city of [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]].\n\n=====Southeast=====\n[[File:Lobo Theater, Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|Lobo Theater in Nob Hill]]\n\nKirtland Air Force Base, Sandia National Laboratories, Sandia Science & Technology Park, [[Albuquerque International Sunport]], [[Eclipse Aerospace]], [[American Society of Radiologic Technologists]], Central New Mexico Community College, Albuquerque Veloport, [[University Stadium, Albuquerque|University Stadium]], [[Rio Grande Credit Union Field at Isotopes Park]], [[The Pit (arena)|The Pit]], [[Mesa del Sol]], [[The Pavilion (amphitheatre)|The Pavilion]], Albuquerque Studios, Isleta Resort & Casino, the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History, New Mexico Veterans' Memorial, and Talin Market are all in the Southeast quadrant.\n\nThe upscale neighborhood of Four Hills is in the foothills of Southeast Albuquerque. Other neighborhoods include [[Nob Hill, Albuquerque|Nob Hill]], Ridgecrest, Willow Wood, and Volterra.\n\n=====Southwest=====\nTraditionally consisting of agricultural and rural areas and suburban neighborhoods, the Southwest quadrant comprises the south-end of Downtown Albuquerque, the [[Barelas]] neighborhood, the rapidly growing west side, and the community of [[South Valley, New Mexico]], often called \"The South Valley\". Although the South Valley is not within Albuquerque's city limits, the quadrant extends through it all the way to the Isleta Indian Reservation. Newer suburban subdivisions on the [[West Mesa]] near the southwestern city limits join homes of older construction, some dating as far back as the 1940s. This quadrant includes the old communities of Atrisco, Los Padillas, Huning Castle, Kinney, Westgate, Westside, Alamosa, Mountainview, and Pajarito. The Bosque (\"woodlands\"), the [[National Hispanic Cultural Center]], the [[Rio Grande Zoo]], and [[Tingley Beach]] are also here.\n\nA new adopted development plan, the Santolina Master Plan, will extend development on the west side past 118th Street SW to the edge of the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande)|Rio Puerco Valley]] and house 100,000 by 2050. It is unclear whether the Santolina development will be annexed by the City of Albuquerque or incorporated as its own city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernco.gov/planning/proposed-santolina-level-a-master-plan.aspx|title=Adopted Santolina Level A Master Plan-Bernalillo County, New Mexico|work=bernco.gov|access-date=September 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907040938/http://www.bernco.gov/planning/proposed-santolina-level-a-master-plan.aspx|archive-date=September 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nAlbuquerque's climate is classified as a dry Warm Temperate climate, as defined by The Biota of North America Program <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bonap.org/Climate%20Maps/climate48shadeA.png |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124115104/http://www.bonap.org/Climate%20Maps/climate48shadeA.png |archive-date=November 24, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the U.S. Geological Survey's Terrestrial Ecosystems\u2014Isobioclimates of the Conterminous United States,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3084/|title=USGS Scientific Investigations Map 3084: Terrestrial Ecosystems\u2014Isobioclimates of the Conterminous United States|website=pubs.usgs.gov|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901232200/https://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3084/|archive-date=September 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> using datasets and mapping technology such as those from the PRISM Climate Group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://prism.oregonstate.edu/|title=PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State U|website=prism.oregonstate.edu|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122024305/http://prism.oregonstate.edu/|archive-date=January 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> In the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Albuquerque's climate is classified as a [[Cold semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'').\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Albuquerque ([[Albuquerque International Sunport]]), 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1891\u2013present{{efn|Official records for Albuquerque kept December 1891 to January 22, 1933 at the Weather Bureau Office and at Albuquerque Int'l since January 23, 1933.

Daytime weather is typically rather mild compared to parts of the country further north or further south. However, due to the city's high elevation, daily temperature differences can vary widely and low temperatures in winter typically dip well below freezing. The daily average temperatures in December and January, the coldest months, are slightly above freezing at {{convert|36.3|\u00b0F}} and {{convert|36.4|\u00b0F}} respectively.\n\nAlbuquerque's climate is usually sunny and dry, with an average of 3,415 sunshine hours per year.<ref name=\"noaasun\" /><ref name=\"NOAA\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/nm/290041.pdf\n |title        = NCDC: U.S. Climate Normals\n |accessdate   = October 31, 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140723140613/http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/nm/290041.pdf\n |archive-date = July 23, 2014\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref> Brilliant sunshine defines the region, averaging 278&nbsp;days a year; periods of variably mid and high-level cloudiness temper the sun, mostly during the cooler months.

Such large snowfalls are rare occurrences during the period of record, and they greatly impact traffic movement and the workforce throughout the city due to their rarity.\n\nThe mountains and highlands east of the city create a [[rain shadow]] effect, due to the drying of air descending the mountains; the city usually receives very little rain or snow, averaging 8\u20139&nbsp;inches (216&nbsp;mm) of precipitation per year. Valley and west mesa areas, farther from the mountains are drier, averaging 6\u20138&nbsp;inches of annual precipitation; the Sandia foothills tend to lift any available moisture, enhancing precipitation to about 10\u201317&nbsp;inches annually.\n\nTraveling west, north, and east of Albuquerque, one quickly rises in elevation and leaves the sheltering effect of the valley to enter a noticeably cooler and slightly wetter environment.

Much of the [[rain]]water Albuquerque receives does not recharge its aquifer. It is diverted through a network of paved channels and [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]]s and empties into the [[Rio Grande]].\n\nOf the {{convert|62780|acre.ft}} per year of the water in the upper [[Colorado River]] basin entitled to municipalities in New Mexico by the [[Colorado River Compact|Upper Colorado River Basin Compact]], Albuquerque owns 48,200. The water is delivered to the Rio Grande by the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan]]\u2013[[Rio Chama (Rio Grande)|Chama]] Project. The project's construction was initiated by legislation signed by President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1962, and was completed in 1971. This diversion project transports water under the [[continental divide]] from [[Navajo Lake]] to Lake Heron on the Rio Chama, a tributary of the Rio Grande. In the past much of this water was resold to downstream owners in Texas. These arrangements ended in 2008 with the completion of the ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project.<ref>The project's page at the United States Bureau of Reclamation's website {{cite web |url=http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=San%20Juan-Chama%20Project |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925123715/http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=San%20Juan-Chama%20Project |archivedate=September 25, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project uses a system of adjustable-height dams to skim water from the Rio Grande into [[sluice]]s that lead to [[water treatment]] facilities for direct [[Water purification|conversion to potable water]]. Some water is allowed to flow through central Albuquerque, mostly to protect the endangered [[Rio Grande Silvery Minnow]]. [[Sewage treatment|Treated]] effluent water is recycled into the Rio Grande south of the city. The ABCWUA expects river water to comprise up to seventy percent of its water budget in 2060. [[Groundwater]] will constitute the remainder.

During those years of expansion, the planning of the newer areas has considered that people drive rather than walk. The pre-1940s parts of Albuquerque are quite different in style and scale from the post-1940s areas. The older areas include the North Valley, the South Valley, various neighborhoods near downtown, and Corrales. The newer areas generally feature four- to six-lane roads in a <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">1&nbsp;mile&nbsp;(1.61&nbsp;km)</span> grid. Each <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">1&nbsp;square mile&nbsp;(2.59&nbsp;km\u00b2)</span> is divided into four {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} neighborhoods by smaller roads set <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">0.5&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(0.8&nbsp;km)</span> between major roads. When driving along major roads in the newer sections of Albuquerque, one sees strip malls, signs, and cinderblock walls. The upside of this planning style is that neighborhoods are shielded from the worst of the noise and lights on the major roads. The downside is that it is virtually impossible to go anywhere without driving.\n\n===Parks and recreation===\nAccording to the Trust for Public Land, Albuquerque has 291 public parks as of 2017, most of which are administered by the city Parks and Recreation Department. The total amount of parkland is 42.9 square miles (111 km2), or about 23% of the city's total area\u2014one of the highest percentages among large cities in the U.S. About 82% of city residents live within walking distance of a park.\n\nAlbuquerque has a botanical and zoological complex called the Albuquerque Biological Park, consisting of the Rio Grande Botanic Garden, Albuquerque Aquarium, Tingley Beach, and the Rio Grande Zoo.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Isotopes Park Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|Isotopes baseball park]]\nThe [[Albuquerque Isotopes]] are a minor league affiliate of the [[Colorado Rockies]], having derived their name from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' season 12 episode \"[[Hungry, Hungry Homer]]\", which involves the [[Springfield Isotopes]] baseball team considering relocating to Albuquerque.<ref>{{cite news| title=Doh!

During his retreat from [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops into [[Texas]] he made a stand on April 8, 1862, at Albuquerque and fought the [[Battle of Albuquerque]] against a detachment of Union soldiers commanded by Colonel [[Edward Canby|Edward R.

In 1902, the famous Alvarado Hotel was built adjacent to the new passenger depot, and it remained a symbol of the city until it was razed in 1970 to make room for a parking lot. In 2002, the [[Alvarado Transportation Center]] was built on the site in a manner resembling the old landmark. The large metro station functions as the downtown headquarters for the city's transit department. It also serves as an intermodal hub for local buses, [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] buses, [[Amtrak]] passenger trains, and the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express|Rail Runner]] commuter rail line.\n\nNew Mexico's dry climate brought many [[tuberculosis]] patients to the city in search of a cure during the early 20th century, and several sanitaria sprang up on the [[West Mesa]] to serve them. Presbyterian Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital, two of the largest hospitals in the Southwest, had their beginnings during this period. Influential [[New Deal]]\u2013era governor [[Clyde Tingley]] and famed Southwestern architect [[John Gaw Meem]] were among those brought to New Mexico by tuberculosis.\n[[File:McCanna-Hubbell Building, Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|The [[McCanna\u2013Hubbell Building]], built in 1915, is one of downtown Albuquerque's many historic buildings|alt=|left]]\n\nThe first travelers on [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] appeared in Albuquerque in 1926, and before long, dozens of motels, restaurants, and gift shops had sprung up along the roadside to serve them.

The intersection of Fourth and Central downtown was the principal crossroads of the city for decades.

The population of the city proper was estimated at 528,497 in 2009, up from 448,607 in the 2000 census.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Erick |last=Siermers |title=Managing Albuquerque's growth |url=http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/sep/17/albuquerque-metro-area-population-projected-reach-/ |date=September 17, 2007 |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222005227/http://abqtrib.com/news/2007/sep/17/albuquerque-metro-area-population-projected-reach-/ |archivedate=February 22, 2010  }}</ref> During 2005 and 2006, the city celebrated its tricentennial with a diverse program of cultural events.\n\nThe passage of the Planned Growth Strategy in 2002\u20132004 was the community's strongest effort to create a framework for a more balanced and sustainable approach to urban growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cabq.gov/council/pgs.html |title=Planned Growth Strategy |publisher=Cabq.gov |date=March 19, 2007 |accessdate=July 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517213447/http://www.cabq.gov/council/pgs.html |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nUrban sprawl is limited on three sides\u2014by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] to the north, the [[Pueblo of Isleta|Isleta Pueblo]] and Kirtland Air Force Base to the south, and the Sandia Mountains to the east.

In Rio Rancho to the northwest, the communities east of the mountains, and the incorporated parts of [[Valencia County]], population growth rates approach twice that of Albuquerque. The primary cities in Valencia County are [[Los Lunas, New Mexico|Los Lunas]] and [[Belen, New Mexico|Belen]], both of which are home to growing industrial complexes and new residential subdivisions. The mountain towns of [[Tijeras, New Mexico|Tijeras]], [[Edgewood, New Mexico|Edgewood]], and [[Moriarty, New Mexico|Moriarty]], while close enough to Albuquerque to be considered suburbs, have experienced much less growth compared to Rio Rancho, Bernalillo, Los Lunas, and Belen. Limited water supply and rugged terrain are the main limiting factors for development in these towns. The [[Mid Region Council of Governments]] (MRCOG), which includes constituents from throughout the Albuquerque area, was formed to ensure that these governments along the middle Rio Grande would be able to meet the needs of their rapidly rising populations. MRCOG's cornerstone project is currently the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]].

The elevation of the city ranges from <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">4,900&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(1,490&nbsp;m)</span> [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] near the Rio Grande (in the Valley) to over <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">6,700&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(1,950&nbsp;m)</span> in the foothill areas of [[Sandia Heights, New Mexico|Sandia Heights]] and Glenwood Hills.

The New Mexico portion of the Rio Grande lies within the [[Rio Grande Rift]] Valley, bordered by a system of [[fault (geology)|fault]]s, including those that lifted up the adjacent [[Sandia Mountains|Sandia]] and [[Manzano Mountains]], while lowering the area where the life-sustaining Rio Grande now flows.\n\n===Geology===\nAlbuquerque lies in the [[Albuquerque Basin]], a portion of the [[Rio Grande rift]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/resources/water/projects/Albuquerque_basin.html \n |title=Albuquerque Basin \n |publisher=The New Mexico Bureau of Geology & Mineral Resources \n |accessdate=September 28, 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107124156/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/resources/water/projects/Albuquerque_basin.html \n |archivedate=November 7, 2012 \n}}</ref>\nThe [[Sandia Mountains]] are the predominant geographic feature visible in Albuquerque. ''Sand\u00eda'' is Spanish for \"[[watermelon]]\", and is popularly believed to be a reference to the brilliant coloration of the mountains at sunset: bright pink (melon meat) and green (melon rind). The pink is due to large exposures of [[granodiorite]] cliffs, and the green is due to large swaths of [[conifer]] forests. However, Robert Julyan notes in ''The Place Names of New Mexico'', \"the most likely explanation is the one believed by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] Indians: the Spaniards, when they encountered the Pueblo in 1540, called it Sandia, because they thought the squash growing there were watermelons, and the name Sandia soon was transferred to the mountains east of the pueblo.\"<ref name=\"julyan\">Robert Julyan, ''The Place Names of New Mexico'' (revised edition), UNM Press, 1998.</ref> He also notes that the Sandia Pueblo Indians call the mountain ''Bien Mur'', \"big mountain.\"<ref name=\"julyan\"/>\n\nThe Sandia foothills, on the west side of the mountains, have soils derived from that same rock material with varying sizes of decomposed granite, mixed with areas of clay and [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]] (a [[calcium carbonate]] deposit common in the arid southwestern USA), along with some exposed [[granite]] bedrock.\n\nBelow the foothills, the area usually called the \"Northeast Heights\" consists of a mix of clay and [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]] soils, overlaying a layer of decomposed granite, resulting from long-term outwash of that material from the adjacent mountains. This [[bajada (geography)|bajada]] is quite noticeable when driving into Albuquerque from the north or south, due to its fairly uniform slope from the mountains' edge downhill to the valley. Sand hills are scattered along the I-25 corridor and directly above the Rio Grande Valley, forming the lower end of the Heights.\n\nThe Rio Grande Valley, due to long-term shifting of the actual river channel, contains layers and areas of soils varying between [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]], clay, loam, and even some sand. It is the only part of Albuquerque where the [[water table]] often lies close to the surface, sometimes less than {{convert|10|ft|m}}.\n\nThe last significant area of Albuquerque geologically is the [[West Mesa]]: this is the elevated land west of the Rio Grande, including \"West Bluff\", the sandy terrace immediately west and above the river, and the rather sharply defined volcanic escarpment above and west of most of the developed city. The west mesa commonly has soils often referred to as \"blow sand\", along with occasional clay and caliche and even basalt, nearing the escarpment.\n\n===Potential and former native flora===\nFlora or vegetation surrounding the built portions of the city are typical of their desert southwestern and interior west setting, within the varied elevations and terrain. The limits are by significant urbanization, including much infill development occurring in the last quarter of the twentieth century.\n\nSandy soils include scrub and mesa vegetation such as sand sagebrush (''Artemisia filifolia''), fourwing saltbush (''Atriplex canescens''). Some similar grass and seasonal wildflower species occur that also occur in areas east of the Rio Grande, but in much lower densities. Sparsely as well, sandy soil grasses occur such as Indian ricegrass (''Oryzopsis hymenoides''), sand dropseed (''Sporobolus cryptandrus''), and mesa dropseed (''Sporobolus flexuosus''). Arroyos contain desert willow (''Chilopsis linearis'') while breaks and the prominent volcanic escarpment include threeleaf sumac with less frequent stands of oneseed juniper (''Juniperus monosperma''), netleaf hackberry (''Celtis reticulata''), mariola (''Parthenium incanum''), and beebrush or oreganillo (''Aloysia wrightii''). Isolated littleleaf sumac (''Rhus microphylla'') occurs on the hillsides above Taylor Ranch and at the Petroglyph National Monument Visitor's Center.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bonap.net/NAPA/Genus/Traditional/County|title=2014 BONAP North American Plant Atlas|website=bonap.net|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200111013950/http://bonap.net/NAPA/Genus/Traditional/County|archive-date=January 11, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOther areas of Albuquerque have more fine clay and caliche soils, plus more rainfall and slightly cooler temperatures, so natural vegetation is dominated by grassland species such as fluffgrass (''Erioneuron pulchellum''), purple threeawn (''Hilaria mutica'' or ''Pleuraphis mutica''), bush muhly (''Muhlenbergia porteri''), and black grama (''Bouteloua eriopoda''). Some woody plants occur in overall grassy areas, mainly fourwing saltbush (''Atriplex canescens'') and snakeweed (''Gutierrezia microcephala''). Isolated stands of creosote bush (''Larrea tridentata'') were reported by long-time residents on gravelly, desert pavement soils existing above arroyos and warm breaks, prior to urbanization in the Northeast Quadrant of Albuquerque.<ref>personal correspondence with Dave Ferguson and Tom Bosiljevac, 2004 and earlier</ref> Today only remnants of creosote bush scrub remain in similar soils in foothill areas of Kirtland Air Force Base according to \"Biologic Surveys for the Sandia National Laboratories Coyote Canyon Test Complex \u2013 Kirtland Air Force Base Albuquerque, New Mexico (Marron and Associates, Inc., May 1994)\",<ref>{{Cite document|title=Biologic surveys for the Sandia National Laboratories, Coyote Canyon Test Complex, Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico|first1=R.

Some botanists and longtime residents <ref>personal correspondence with Dave Ferguson, 2004 and earlier</ref> recall riparian vegetation, including screwbean mesquite or tornillo (''Prosopis pubescens''), Gooding's willow (''Salix goodingii''), and saint sacaton (''Sporobulus wrightii''). The present bosque or gallery forest of Rio Grande cottonwood (''Populus deltoides var. wislizeni'') and coyote willow (''Salix exigua'') is theorized to have been more savannah-like, prior to replanting in the 1930s. Grass and low cactus cover of many areas is typical of a broader region of the intermontane west riparian zones, such as saltgrass (''Distychilis spp.'') and alkali sacaton (''Sporobulus airoides''). Discontinuous, small stands of New Mexico olive (''Forestiera pubescens var. neomexicana''), Arizona walnut (''Juglans major''), and Arizona ash (''Fraxinus velutina'') can be seen near bosque areas and near former river bends in central New Mexico just north and south of the Albuquerque city limits in the Corrales bosque and along former channels of the Rio Grande in Valencia and Socorro counties. The forest now has a large proportion of non-native species including [[Ulmus pumila|Siberian elm]], [[Elaeagnus angustifolia|Russian olive]], [[Tamarix|saltcedar]], [[Morus (plant)|mulberries]], [[Ailanthus altissima|Ailanthus]], and [[Saccharum ravennae|ravenna grass]]. Some restoration to native species is occurring, similar to the limited species of ''Populus'' and ''Salix'' used in the 1930s.\n\nOne prominent species of native Mountainous trees is the [[pinyon pine|pi\u00f1on pine]]. At the east end of the city, the Sandia foothills receive about 50 percent more precipitation than most of the city, and with granitic, coarse soils, rock outcrops, and boulders dominant, they have a greater and different diversity of flora in the form of savanna and chaparral, dominated by lower and middle zones of New Mexico Mountains vegetation, with a slight orientation at lower elevations. Dominant plants include shrub or desert live oak (''Quercus turbinella''), gray oak (''Quercus grisea''), hairy mountain mahogany (''Cercocarpus breviflorus''), oneseed juniper (''Juniperus monosperma''), pi\u00f1on (''Pinus edulis''), threeleaf sumac (''Rhus trilobata''), Engelmann prickly pear (''Opuntia engelmannii''), juniper prickly pear (''Opuntia hystricina var. juniperiana''), and beargrass (''Nolina greenei'', formerly considered ''Nolina texana''). Similar grasses occur that are native to the eastern half of the city, but often of a higher density owing to increased precipitation. The foothills of Albuquerque are much less urbanized, the vegetation altered or removed than anywhere else in the city, though the lower areas have been mostly developed in a more dense suburban pattern in mostly developed communities including North Albuquerque Acres, Tanoan, High Desert, Glenwood Hills, Embudo Hills, Supper Rock, and Four Hills.\n\n===Native and other fauna===\nAn iconic bird often seen in Albuquerque is the [[greater roadrunner]]. Other birds include the common raven, American crow, great-tailed grackle, Gambel's and scaled quail, several species of hummingbirds, house finch, pigeon, mourning dove, [[White-winged dove|white wing]] and [[Eurasian collared dove|European collared doves]] (both recent appearances), curve-billed thrasher, pinyon jay, and Cooper's, Swainson's, and red-tail hawks. The valley hosts [[sandhill crane]]s each winter.\n\nWithin city limits, the [[southwestern fence lizard]] and [[Aspidoscelis|whiptails]] are common. Snakes include the [[Common garter snake|New Mexico garter snake]] and the [[bullsnake]] in the [[Bosque|Rio Grande Bosque]], and at the edges of the city, the venomous [[Western diamondback rattlesnake]]. [[Woodhouse's toad|Woodhouse toads]] and non-native [[American bullfrog|bullfrogs]] are common around the Rio Grande. Retention ponds within the city often serve as breeding pools for [[New Mexico spadefoot toad]]s and [[Notostraca|tadpole shrimp]] (\"Triops\").\n\nCommonly seen mammals include the [[coyote]], [[rock squirrel]], [[Gunnison's prairie dog]], [[desert cottontail]], and [[black-tailed jackrabbit]]. Striped skunks, raccoons, and several mouse species can be found in the city, and mule deer and [[Pack rat|woodrats]] occur in the foothills. The broader area is home to bobcat, black bear, and mountain lion, and is at the north end of the range of the [[ring-tailed cat|ringtail]] and [[Collared peccary|javelina]].\n\nLarger arthropods include the [[Neotibicen dealbatus|plains cicada]], [[Mastigoproctus giganteus|vinegaroon]], [[Scolopendra polymorpha|desert centipede]], [[Hyles lineata|white-lined sphynx]] (hummingbird moth), [[Papilio multicaudata|two-tailed swallowtail]], [[Figeater beetle|fig beetle]], [[Stagmomantis limbata|New Mexico mantis]], and [[Pogonomyrmex|harvester ant]].\n\n===Cityscape===\n{{wide image|Albuquerque_pano_sunset.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of the city of Albuquerque}}\n\n====Quadrants====\nAlbuquerque is geographically divided into four [[Address (geography)#Quadrants|quadrants]] that are officially part of mailing addresses. They are NE (northeast), NW (northwest), SE (southeast), and SW (southwest). The north-south dividing line is Central Avenue (the path that [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] took through the city), and the east-west dividing line is the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express|Rail Runner]] tracks.\n\n=====Northeast=====\n\nThis quadrant has been experiencing a housing expansion since the late 1950s. It abuts the base of the Sandia Mountains and contains portions of the foothills neighborhoods, which are significantly higher, in elevation and price range, than the rest of the city. Running from Central Avenue and the railroad tracks to the [[Sandia Peak Tramway|Sandia Peak Aerial Tram]], this is the largest quadrant both geographically and by population. Martineztown, the University of New Mexico, the [[Maxwell Museum of Anthropology]], Nob Hill, the Uptown area which includes three shopping malls ([[Coronado Center]], ABQ Uptown, and Winrock Town Center), Hoffmantown, Journal Center, [[Cliff's Amusement Park]], and Balloon Fiesta Park are all in this quadrant.\n\nSome of the most affluent neighborhoods in the city are here, including: [[High Desert, Albuquerque, New Mexico|High Desert]], Tanoan, Sandia Heights, and North Albuquerque Acres. Parts of Sandia Heights and North Albuquerque Acres are outside the city limits proper. A few houses in the farthest reach of this quadrant lie in the [[Cibola National Forest]], just over the line into [[Sandoval County, New Mexico|Sandoval County]].\n\n=====Northwest=====\n[[File:KiMo Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|KiMo Theatre in Downtown]]\n\nThis quadrant contains historic [[Old Town Albuquerque]], which dates to the 18th century, as well as the [[Indian Pueblo Cultural Center]]. The area has a mixture of commercial districts and low to high-income neighborhoods. Northwest Albuquerque includes the largest section of [[Downtown Albuquerque|Downtown]], [[Rio Grande Nature Center State Park]] and the [[Bosque]] (\"woodlands\"), Petroglyph National Monument, [[Double Eagle II Airport]], the Paradise Hills neighborhood, Taylor Ranch, and [[Cottonwood Mall (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Cottonwood Mall]].\n\nThis quadrant also contains the [[North Valley, New Mexico|North Valley]] settlement, outside the city limits, which has some expensive homes and small ranches along the [[Rio Grande]]. The city of Albuquerque engulfs the village of [[Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, New Mexico|Los Ranchos de Albuquerque]]. A small portion of the rapidly developing area on the west side of the river south of the Petroglyphs, known as the \"[[West Mesa]]\" or \"Westside\", consisting primarily of traditional residential subdivisions, also extends into this quadrant. The city proper is bordered on the north by the North Valley, the village of [[Corrales, New Mexico|Corrales]], and the city of [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]].\n\n=====Southeast=====\n[[File:Lobo Theater, Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|Lobo Theater in Nob Hill]]\n\nKirtland Air Force Base, Sandia National Laboratories, Sandia Science & Technology Park, [[Albuquerque International Sunport]], [[Eclipse Aerospace]], [[American Society of Radiologic Technologists]], Central New Mexico Community College, Albuquerque Veloport, [[University Stadium, Albuquerque|University Stadium]], [[Rio Grande Credit Union Field at Isotopes Park]], [[The Pit (arena)|The Pit]], [[Mesa del Sol]], [[The Pavilion (amphitheatre)|The Pavilion]], Albuquerque Studios, Isleta Resort & Casino, the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History, New Mexico Veterans' Memorial, and Talin Market are all in the Southeast quadrant.\n\nThe upscale neighborhood of Four Hills is in the foothills of Southeast Albuquerque. Other neighborhoods include [[Nob Hill, Albuquerque|Nob Hill]], Ridgecrest, Willow Wood, and Volterra.\n\n=====Southwest=====\nTraditionally consisting of agricultural and rural areas and suburban neighborhoods, the Southwest quadrant comprises the south-end of Downtown Albuquerque, the [[Barelas]] neighborhood, the rapidly growing west side, and the community of [[South Valley, New Mexico]], often called \"The South Valley\". Although the South Valley is not within Albuquerque's city limits, the quadrant extends through it all the way to the Isleta Indian Reservation. Newer suburban subdivisions on the [[West Mesa]] near the southwestern city limits join homes of older construction, some dating as far back as the 1940s. This quadrant includes the old communities of Atrisco, Los Padillas, Huning Castle, Kinney, Westgate, Westside, Alamosa, Mountainview, and Pajarito. The Bosque (\"woodlands\"), the [[National Hispanic Cultural Center]], the [[Rio Grande Zoo]], and [[Tingley Beach]] are also here.\n\nA new adopted development plan, the Santolina Master Plan, will extend development on the west side past 118th Street SW to the edge of the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande)|Rio Puerco Valley]] and house 100,000 by 2050. It is unclear whether the Santolina development will be annexed by the City of Albuquerque or incorporated as its own city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernco.gov/planning/proposed-santolina-level-a-master-plan.aspx|title=Adopted Santolina Level A Master Plan-Bernalillo County, New Mexico|work=bernco.gov|access-date=September 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907040938/http://www.bernco.gov/planning/proposed-santolina-level-a-master-plan.aspx|archive-date=September 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nAlbuquerque's climate is classified as a dry Warm Temperate climate, as defined by The Biota of North America Program <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bonap.org/Climate%20Maps/climate48shadeA.png |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124115104/http://www.bonap.org/Climate%20Maps/climate48shadeA.png |archive-date=November 24, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the U.S. Geological Survey's Terrestrial Ecosystems\u2014Isobioclimates of the Conterminous United States,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3084/|title=USGS Scientific Investigations Map 3084: Terrestrial Ecosystems\u2014Isobioclimates of the Conterminous United States|website=pubs.usgs.gov|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901232200/https://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3084/|archive-date=September 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> using datasets and mapping technology such as those from the PRISM Climate Group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://prism.oregonstate.edu/|title=PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State U|website=prism.oregonstate.edu|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122024305/http://prism.oregonstate.edu/|archive-date=January 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> In the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Albuquerque's climate is classified as a [[Cold semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'').\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Albuquerque ([[Albuquerque International Sunport]]), 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1891\u2013present{{efn|Official records for Albuquerque kept December 1891 to January 22, 1933 at the Weather Bureau Office and at Albuquerque Int'l since January 23, 1933.

Though the city lies to the north of the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], parts of Albuquerque shares a similar aridity, temperature regime, and natural vegetation to that of the Chihuahuan Desert, namely the upper elevations with desert grassland and sand scrub plant communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_circulars/CR374/#1|title=NMSU: New Mexico Range Plants|website=aces.nmsu.edu|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503163417/https://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_circulars/CR374/#1|archive-date=May 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The eastern areas of the Greater Albuquerque Area, known as the East Mountain Area, lie the [[Southwestern Tablelands]] and are sometimes considered a southern extension of the central high plains and northeast New Mexico highlands. To the north is the [[Southern Rockies]] ecoregion in the Jemez Mountains.\n\nThe average annual precipitation is less than half of evaporation providing an arid climate, and no month's daily temperature averages below freezing. Daytime weather is typically rather mild compared to parts of the country further north or further south. However, due to the city's high elevation, daily temperature differences can vary widely and low temperatures in winter typically dip well below freezing. The daily average temperatures in December and January, the coldest months, are slightly above freezing at {{convert|36.3|\u00b0F}} and {{convert|36.4|\u00b0F}} respectively.\n\nAlbuquerque's climate is usually sunny and dry, with an average of 3,415 sunshine hours per year.<ref name=\"noaasun\" /><ref name=\"NOAA\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/nm/290041.pdf\n |title        = NCDC: U.S. Climate Normals\n |accessdate   = October 31, 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140723140613/http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/nm/290041.pdf\n |archive-date = July 23, 2014\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref> Brilliant sunshine defines the region, averaging 278&nbsp;days a year; periods of variably mid and high-level cloudiness temper the sun, mostly during the cooler months. Extended cloudiness lasting longer than two or three days is rare.\n\nWinter typically consists of cool days and cold nights, except following passage of the strongest cold fronts and arctic airmasses when daytime temperatures remain colder than average; overnight temperatures tend to fall below freezing between about 10 pm and 8 am in the city, except during colder airmasses, plus colder spots of the valley and most of the East Mountain areas. December, the coolest month, averages {{convert|36.3|\u00b0F|1}}, although extreme low temperatures bottom out in early January; the median or normal coolest temperature of the year is just above {{convert|10|\u00b0F|0}}, though the average or mean is below {{convert|10|\u00b0F|0}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Images/300dpi/NM.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215165129/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Images/300dpi/NM.jpg |archive-date=December 15, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"wrcc.dri.edu\">{{Cite web|url=https://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?nm0234|title=ALBUQUERQUE INTL AP, NEW MEXICO - Climate Summary|website=wrcc.dri.edu|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170527143551/http://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?nm0234|archive-date=May 27, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> It is typical for daily low temperatures in much of December, January, and February to be below freezing, the long-term average 76 of 90 days falling to or below freezing; four 24 hour days stay below freezing on average, though that often occurs for less hours west of the Rio Grande and in the Heights.<ref name=\"wrcc.dri.edu\"/>\n\nSpring is windy, sometimes unsettled with rain, though spring is usually the driest part of the year in Albuquerque. March and April tend to experience many days with the wind blowing at {{convert|20|to|30|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and afternoon gusts can produce periods of blowing sand and dust. In May, the winds tend to subside as a summer-like airmass and temperatures begin to occur with regularity.\n\nSummer is lengthy and very warm to hot, relatively tolerable for most people because of low humidity and air movement.

Locations in the Northeast Heights and Eastern Foothills tend to receive more snowfall due to each region's higher elevation and proximity to the mountains.

Such large snowfalls are rare occurrences during the period of record, and they greatly impact traffic movement and the workforce throughout the city due to their rarity.\n\nThe mountains and highlands east of the city create a [[rain shadow]] effect, due to the drying of air descending the mountains; the city usually receives very little rain or snow, averaging 8\u20139&nbsp;inches (216&nbsp;mm) of precipitation per year. Valley and west mesa areas, farther from the mountains are drier, averaging 6\u20138&nbsp;inches of annual precipitation; the Sandia foothills tend to lift any available moisture, enhancing precipitation to about 10\u201317&nbsp;inches annually.\n\nTraveling west, north, and east of Albuquerque, one quickly rises in elevation and leaves the sheltering effect of the valley to enter a noticeably cooler and slightly wetter environment. One such area is considered part of Albuquerque Metropolitan Area, commonly called the East Mountain area; it is covered in woodlands of juniper and pi\u00f1on trees, a common trait of southwestern uplands and the southernmost Rocky Mountains.\n\n===Hydrology===\n{{see also|Kirtland Air Force Base#Environmental contamination due to jet fuel spill}}\n\nAlbuquerque's [[drinking water]] comes from a combination of Rio Grande water (river water diverted from the [[Colorado River]] basin through the [[San Juan-Chama Project]]<ref>{{cite web| title=Your Drinking Water| url=http://www.abcwua.org/Your_Drinking_Water.aspx| accessdate=August 1, 2013| website=Albuquerque Bernalillo Water Authority| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805163835/http://abcwua.org/Your_Drinking_Water.aspx| archive-date=August 5, 2013| url-status=live}}</ref>) and a delicate [[aquifer]] that has been described as an \"underground [[Lake Superior]]\".

Much of the [[rain]]water Albuquerque receives does not recharge its aquifer. It is diverted through a network of paved channels and [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]]s and empties into the [[Rio Grande]].\n\nOf the {{convert|62780|acre.ft}} per year of the water in the upper [[Colorado River]] basin entitled to municipalities in New Mexico by the [[Colorado River Compact|Upper Colorado River Basin Compact]], Albuquerque owns 48,200. The water is delivered to the Rio Grande by the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan]]\u2013[[Rio Chama (Rio Grande)|Chama]] Project. The project's construction was initiated by legislation signed by President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1962, and was completed in 1971. This diversion project transports water under the [[continental divide]] from [[Navajo Lake]] to Lake Heron on the Rio Chama, a tributary of the Rio Grande. In the past much of this water was resold to downstream owners in Texas. These arrangements ended in 2008 with the completion of the ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project.<ref>The project's page at the United States Bureau of Reclamation's website {{cite web |url=http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=San%20Juan-Chama%20Project |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925123715/http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=San%20Juan-Chama%20Project |archivedate=September 25, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project uses a system of adjustable-height dams to skim water from the Rio Grande into [[sluice]]s that lead to [[water treatment]] facilities for direct [[Water purification|conversion to potable water]]. Some water is allowed to flow through central Albuquerque, mostly to protect the endangered [[Rio Grande Silvery Minnow]]. [[Sewage treatment|Treated]] effluent water is recycled into the Rio Grande south of the city. The ABCWUA expects river water to comprise up to seventy percent of its water budget in 2060. [[Groundwater]] will constitute the remainder.

During those years of expansion, the planning of the newer areas has considered that people drive rather than walk. The pre-1940s parts of Albuquerque are quite different in style and scale from the post-1940s areas. The older areas include the North Valley, the South Valley, various neighborhoods near downtown, and Corrales. The newer areas generally feature four- to six-lane roads in a <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">1&nbsp;mile&nbsp;(1.61&nbsp;km)</span> grid. Each <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">1&nbsp;square mile&nbsp;(2.59&nbsp;km\u00b2)</span> is divided into four {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} neighborhoods by smaller roads set <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">0.5&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(0.8&nbsp;km)</span> between major roads. When driving along major roads in the newer sections of Albuquerque, one sees strip malls, signs, and cinderblock walls. The upside of this planning style is that neighborhoods are shielded from the worst of the noise and lights on the major roads. The downside is that it is virtually impossible to go anywhere without driving.\n\n===Parks and recreation===\nAccording to the Trust for Public Land, Albuquerque has 291 public parks as of 2017, most of which are administered by the city Parks and Recreation Department.

There is one full [[interchange (road)#Complete interchanges|interchange]] where it connects with Interstate 40; The rest of the route connects to other roads with at-grade intersections controlled by [[stoplight]]s. The Interstate 25 underpass has no access to Coors. Parts of the highway have [[sidewalk]]s, [[bike lane]]s, and [[Median strip|median]]s, but most sections have only dirt shoulders and a center turn lane. To the north of Interstate 40, part of the route is numbered as [[New Mexico State Road 448|State Highway 448]], while to the south, part of the route is numbered as [[New Mexico State Road 45|State Highway 45]].\n* [[New Mexico State Road 500|Rio Bravo Boulevard]]: The main river crossing between Westside Albuquerque and the [[Sunport]], Rio Bravo is a four-lane [[divided highway]] that runs from University Boulevard in the east, through the South Valley, to Coors Boulevard in the west where it is contiguous with Dennis Chaves Blvd. It follows [[New Mexico State Road 500|NM-500]] for its entire route.\n* [[Central Avenue (Albuquerque)|Central Avenue]]: Central is one of the historical routings of [[US Highway 66|Route 66]], it is no longer a main through highway, its usefulness having been supplanted by Interstate 40.<ref name=\"Bryan\" />{{Rp|248}}\n* [[New Mexico State Road 528|Alameda Boulevard]]: The main road between Rio Rancho and North Albuquerque, Alameda Blvd. stretches from Tramway Rd. to Coors.

Tramway Boulevard starts at I-25 near Sandia Pueblo, and heads east as a two-lane road. It turns south near the base of the [[Sandia Peak Tramway]] and becomes an expressway-type divided highway until its terminus near I-40 and Central Avenue by the western entrance to [[Tijeras Canyon]].\n\nThe [[interchange (road)|interchange]] between I-40 and I-25 is known as the \"[[Big I]]\".<ref name=\"Bryan\" />{{Rp|248}} Originally built in 1966, it was rebuilt in 2002.

The laboratory arose from MacKay-Lyons dissatisfaction with the lack of connection between theory and practice in architectural education.<ref name=\":0\" /> Ghost was formerly described<ref>http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/ghost/</ref> as ''an education initiative designed to promote the transfer of architectural knowledge through direct experience - project-based learning taught in the master builder tradition - with emphasis on issues of landscape, material culture, and community.''\n\nThe word 'ghost' is used to convey a sense of travel across time. In the Maritime provinces of Canada, story telling is commonplace in daily life, and was also adopted by MacKay-Lyons in his building practices, and in the design-build.<ref name=\":2\" /> Each year it was run, a group of students, professors and architects were invited to participate, and were to divide their time equally between designing and building the structure. Every build centered around a different theme relevant to architectural discourse, such as Ghost 1, that discussed symbolic form, or Ghost 2 addressing technology. <ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=MacKay-Lyons|first=Brian|date=1995|title=Seven Stories from a Village Architect|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4091342|journal=Design Quarterly|issue=165|pages=1|doi=10.2307/4091342|issn=0011-9415}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/|title=MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects Limited|website=MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects Limited|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> The lab was also continually related to the Arcadian history of the ancient site that was being built on.\n\n== Design Influences and Philosophy ==\nMacKay-Lyons was heavily influenced by his upbringing in Arcadia. He witnessed how the early settlers of Arcadia often tacked generations of their houses onto one another. He regards culture, history and architecture as being organic, with continuous, inherent connections to the landscape.<ref name=\":43\">{{Cite journal|last=MacKay-Lyons|first=Brian|date=1995|title=Seven Stories from a Village Architect|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4091342|journal=Design Quarterly|issue=165|pages=1|doi=10.2307/4091342|issn=0011-9415}}</ref> Additionally, Arcadia\u2019s rich history, simple vernacular buildings and expansive landscape provided MacKay-Lyons with an appreciation for traditional building methods, and the importance of context to a place. He draws inspiration from observing unique qualities of the surroundings, such as<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadianarchitect.com/canadian-architect-gold-medals-2015/|title=RAIC Gold Medal 2015 issue|date=2015-06-14|website=Canadian Architect|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> ''climate, land form or cultural history,'' and uses this as a basis for his design work, as they are already existing and waiting to be discovered. He has stated that he is more interested in rediscovering something that has already been understood, than he is in inventing something new.<ref name=\":3\" /> He therefore believes that his buildings belong to the history of architecture.<ref name=\":43\" />\n\nIn his essay ''Seven Stories From a Village Architect'', titles from a compilation of short stories include simple structures such as<ref name=\":43\" /> ''Boat, Shed and Barn.'' He works with the archetypal quality of these structures to sustain Arcadia\u2019s traditional building typologies. As a child, witnessing the construction of these structures influenced MacKay-Lyons' in his practice and his idea of craft and the vernacular. He has described the vernacular as being <ref name=\":43\" /> ''a process or a cultural view connected to material culture and the culture of building.'' The vernacular has also shaped his view on sustainability, which he considers to be largely cultural. MacKay-Lyons believes cultural sustainability arises when local materials and building practices are used, and has stated that'',<ref name=\":03\" /> \u2018vernacular is what you do when you can\u2019t afford to get it wrong\u2019.'' This continues into his ideas about economy and ethics, as Arcadia\u2019s first settlers were dominantly peasants and a modest way of living was virtuous.<ref name=\":43\" /> MacKay-Lyons adapted this cultural, democratic ethic in his work through the continued use of simple, quiet forms and traditional vernacular styles. He is dedicated to building at least one project a year under $100,000 to stay connected to his democratic ideals and vernacular methods. MacKay-Lyons believes that architecture can only be successful when it is both accessible and affordable. He desires to make buildings that are ''more silent but have more to say.''<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n<br />\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Local Architecture'' (2015), [[Princeton Architectural Press]], {{ISBN|978-1-616-89128-2}}\n* ''Ghost: Building an Architectural Vision'' (2008), [[Princeton Architectural Press]], {{ISBN|978-1-568-98736-1}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/ MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mackay-Lyons, Brian}}\n[[Category:Canadian architects]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Acadian descent]]\n[[Category:People from Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1954 births]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Canadian English|date=November 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Infobox architect\n| name = Brian MacKay-Lyons\n| image = \n| caption = \n| nationality = [[Canadians|Canadian]]\n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|1954|8|26|df=y}}\n| birth_place = [[Arcadia, Nova Scotia|Arcadia]], Nova Scotia, Canada\n| death_date = \n| death_place = \n| alma_mater = Technical University of Nova Scotia , [[University of California, Los Angeles]].\n| practice = \n| significant_buildings = [[Dalhousie Faculty of Computer Science]] (1999), [[Ship's Company Theatre]], [[Parrsboro, Nova Scotia]] (2004) and the Canadian High Commission in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] (2005), Two Hulls House, Sunset Rock House, Sliding House, Enough House, Cliff House\n| significant_projects = \n| significant_design = \n| awards = [[Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Medal]] for architecture, [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada|RAIC Gold Medal]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Brian MacKay-Lyons wins 2015 RAIC Gold Medal|url=http://www.canadianarchitect.com/news/brian-mackay-lyons-wins-2015-raic-gold-medal/1003472395/?&er=NA|accessdate=6 March 2015|work=Canadian Architect|date=10 February 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n'''Brian Mackay-Lyons''' (born 26 August 1954<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/brian-mackay-lyons/ | title=Brian Mackay-Lyons | work=The Canadian Encyclopedia | first1=David | last1=Monteyne | first2=Marc | last2=Boutin | date=17 April 2011 | accessdate=30 November 2013 }}</ref>) is a Canadian architect best known for his designs for houses on the coast of his native [[Nova Scotia]], and his use of Atlantic Canadian [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] materials and construction techniques.

He is a five-time winner of the [[Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Medal]] for architecture, fellow of the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] and honorary fellow of the [[American Institute of Architects]].<ref>http://thechronicleherald.ca/NovaScotia/1141405.html</ref>\n\n== Ghost Lab ==\nIn 1994, Mackay-Lyons began an educational summer [[Design\u2013build|design-build]] program on his family farm near Kingsburg, Nova Scotia entitled the Ghost Architectural Laboratory.<ref name=\":5\" /> As of 2013 the program is no longer taking place, although architecture-related conferences are sometimes held at the same location in the summer. The laboratory arose from MacKay-Lyons dissatisfaction with the lack of connection between theory and practice in architectural education.<ref name=\":0\" /> Ghost was formerly described<ref>http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/ghost/</ref> as ''an education initiative designed to promote the transfer of architectural knowledge through direct experience - project-based learning taught in the master builder tradition - with emphasis on issues of landscape, material culture, and community.''\n\nThe word 'ghost' is used to convey a sense of travel across time. In the Maritime provinces of Canada, story telling is commonplace in daily life, and was also adopted by MacKay-Lyons in his building practices, and in the design-build.<ref name=\":2\" /> Each year it was run, a group of students, professors and architects were invited to participate, and were to divide their time equally between designing and building the structure. Every build centered around a different theme relevant to architectural discourse, such as Ghost 1, that discussed symbolic form, or Ghost 2 addressing technology. <ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=MacKay-Lyons|first=Brian|date=1995|title=Seven Stories from a Village Architect|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4091342|journal=Design Quarterly|issue=165|pages=1|doi=10.2307/4091342|issn=0011-9415}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/|title=MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects Limited|website=MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects Limited|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> The lab was also continually related to the Arcadian history of the ancient site that was being built on.\n\n== Design Influences and Philosophy ==\nMacKay-Lyons was heavily influenced by his upbringing in Arcadia. He witnessed how the early settlers of Arcadia often tacked generations of their houses onto one another. He regards culture, history and architecture as being organic, with continuous, inherent connections to the landscape.<ref name=\":43\">{{Cite journal|last=MacKay-Lyons|first=Brian|date=1995|title=Seven Stories from a Village Architect|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4091342|journal=Design Quarterly|issue=165|pages=1|doi=10.2307/4091342|issn=0011-9415}}</ref> Additionally, Arcadia\u2019s rich history, simple vernacular buildings and expansive landscape provided MacKay-Lyons with an appreciation for traditional building methods, and the importance of context to a place. He draws inspiration from observing unique qualities of the surroundings, such as<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadianarchitect.com/canadian-architect-gold-medals-2015/|title=RAIC Gold Medal 2015 issue|date=2015-06-14|website=Canadian Architect|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> ''climate, land form or cultural history,'' and uses this as a basis for his design work, as they are already existing and waiting to be discovered. He has stated that he is more interested in rediscovering something that has already been understood, than he is in inventing something new.<ref name=\":3\" /> He therefore believes that his buildings belong to the history of architecture.<ref name=\":43\" />\n\nIn his essay ''Seven Stories From a Village Architect'', titles from a compilation of short stories include simple structures such as<ref name=\":43\" /> ''Boat, Shed and Barn.'' He works with the archetypal quality of these structures to sustain Arcadia\u2019s traditional building typologies. As a child, witnessing the construction of these structures influenced MacKay-Lyons' in his practice and his idea of craft and the vernacular. He has described the vernacular as being <ref name=\":43\" /> ''a process or a cultural view connected to material culture and the culture of building.'' The vernacular has also shaped his view on sustainability, which he considers to be largely cultural. MacKay-Lyons believes cultural sustainability arises when local materials and building practices are used, and has stated that'',<ref name=\":03\" /> \u2018vernacular is what you do when you can\u2019t afford to get it wrong\u2019.'' This continues into his ideas about economy and ethics, as Arcadia\u2019s first settlers were dominantly peasants and a modest way of living was virtuous.<ref name=\":43\" /> MacKay-Lyons adapted this cultural, democratic ethic in his work through the continued use of simple, quiet forms and traditional vernacular styles. He is dedicated to building at least one project a year under $100,000 to stay connected to his democratic ideals and vernacular methods. MacKay-Lyons believes that architecture can only be successful when it is both accessible and affordable. He desires to make buildings that are ''more silent but have more to say.''<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n<br />\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Local Architecture'' (2015), [[Princeton Architectural Press]], {{ISBN|978-1-616-89128-2}}\n* ''Ghost: Building an Architectural Vision'' (2008), [[Princeton Architectural Press]], {{ISBN|978-1-568-98736-1}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/ MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mackay-Lyons, Brian}}\n[[Category:Canadian architects]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Acadian descent]]\n[[Category:People from Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1954 births]]\n", "name_user": "2001:56a:f302:1000:e865:a34d:729a:dc2a", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_MacKay-Lyons"}

The community lies within Limestone Creek Township.  Joshua Hoshirama Raynor was once elected as Hokage for his ninja prowess and his incredible jutsu. \n\n==History==\n\n===Native American presence===\n\nThe earliest Native Americans thought to have roamed the area were the [[Joara]] (whose settlements date back to AD 1000), based out of present-day [[Burke County, North Carolina|Burke County]]. The Joara were the chiefdom of the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] culture. Immediately prior to European colonization in the early 18th century, the coastal plain of North Carolina was home to many distinct Native American tribes: the Coree, Coharie, several small [[Neusiok]] communities, and the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]]. This latter tribe gradually became the most dominant in the region as smaller tribes were either exterminated by Europeans or peacefully assimilated into the Tuscarora for collective security. By the time of permanent European settlement, the Tuscarora were utilizing the heavily forested areas of eastern Duplin County as a hunting ground.\n\nNative American burial mounds are numerous in Duplin County, in the rural areas surrounding Beulaville especially. There are four sizable mounds within a ten-mile radius of the town, the two largest being in the vicinity of [[Hallsville, North Carolina|Hallsville]] and [[Sarecta, North Carolina|Sarecta]]. Combined, these mounds contain roughly one hundred bodies.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/notesonindianbur00holm \"Notes on the Indian burial mounds of eastern North Carolina\"]. Retrieved 2013-11-19.</ref>\n\n===European settlement===\n\nThe arrival of the [[German Palatines|Palatines]] at [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] and the ensuing wave of [[English people|English]] and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] settlers sparked a conflict known as the [[Tuscarora War]] (1710\u20131715). With the elimination of the last [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] stronghold at [[Fort Neoheroka]] and subsequent exodus of the remainder of the tribe to [[New York (state)|New York]] (they became the sixth nation of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]), the interior of the coastal plain was made available for European settlement. Many of the original European settlers of what is now Beulaville arrived from [[Jones County, North Carolina|Jones]], [[Onslow County, North Carolina|Onslow]], [[Beaufort County, North Carolina|Beaufort]], and [[Craven County, North Carolina|Craven]] counties.\n\nIn 1736, Duplin County (then upper [[New Hanover County, North Carolina|New Hanover County]]) was the destination of several hundred [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] (Scotch-Irish) and a handful of [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Protestants]]. They settled on a plot of land, {{convert|71160|acre}} between the [[Northeast Cape Fear River]] and [[Black River (North Carolina)|Black River]], obtained from the Crown by Henry McCulloh of London.<ref>[http://www.carolana.com/NC/Royal_Colony/nc_royal_colony_henry_mcculloch.html]</ref> Their first settlements were Soracta (Sarecta) on the Northeast Cape Fear, an area at the lower end of Goshen Swamp (then called Woodward's Chase), and the grove where the Duplin County Courthouse now stands.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://duplin.lostsoulsgenealogy.com/wd_history.htm| title=Duplin County History to 1810| author=William Dickson| publisher=Duplin County community website| accessdate=November 30, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124201604/http://duplin.lostsoulsgenealogy.com/wd_history.htm| archive-date=January 24, 2016| url-status=dead}}</ref> According to census records, several families of Sarecta and the settlement at the south end of Goshen Swamp had gravitated to the crossroads of what would become Beulaville by the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBeulaville proper was founded as \"Snatchet\" in 1873 out of necessity for a trading center for nearby farmers and those in the business of logging and [[turpentine]] production. Also colloquially referred to as \"Tearshirt\" by locals, the town was once notorious for [[alcoholism]] and frequent street brawls. Indeed, the manufacture and distribution of [[corn liquor]] remained a steady source of income for many families well into the 20th century. Upon demolition of a prominent downtown building (which had formerly served as a soda shop in the 1950s) to make way for a McDonald's, a [[moonshine]] still and several barrels of the drink were uncovered in the basement.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.wral.com| title=Rowdy Town| publisher=WRAL.com |date=February 18, 2008| accessdate=November 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Trains/ICC valuations/Kinston\u2013Carolina Railroad and Lumber Company|Kinston Carolina Railroad and Lumber Company]] constructed a railway from [[Kinston, North Carolina|Kinston]] to [[Pink Hill, North Carolina|Pink Hill]] around 1900. In response, residents of Limestone Creek Township spent $15,000 to lobby for the creation of the \"Duplin County Railroad\" in 1916, extending the Kinston line through Beulaville and [[Chinquapin, North Carolina|Chinquapin]]. The rail, which ran alongside present-day Railroad Street, has since been destroyed.<ref>Report of the Corporation Commission for the Biennial Period ..., Issue 19</ref> The post office of Snatchet was officially re-designated \"Beulaville\" in 1910, and the town was incorporated five years later. The town's name is derived from the Beulah Baptist Church (now the Beulaville Baptist Church). Beulaville is the most recent town to be incorporated in Duplin County.\n[[File:Archie Lanier's Store.jpg|thumb|300px|Archie Lanier's Store]]\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Former Beulaville High School.jpg|thumb|300px|Former Beulaville High School]]\n\nIn 1839, the county passed a tax for the creation of a public school system. Several decades later (sometime around 1870) the first public school in what would become Beulaville was constructed. The facility - which was no more than a small wood cabin - employed only one teacher. By 1901, however, four teachers were working out of the schoolhouse.<ref>[http://www.freefeast.com/userpages/Beulaville1.shtml \"Beulaville, North Carolina: A History\"]. Retrieved 2013-11-19.</ref> In 1906, property was purchased for a new school. A new two-story wooden building was erected and first used in the school year of 1917-1918; the enrollment for that year was nearly 200. Three additions \u2013 the auditorium, gym, and band building \u2013 were added in 1923, and additional tracts of land were purchased for the school between 1933 and 1950. On November 6, 1945, the school's main building burned to the ground. Only the John Hargett Gymnasium and auditorium were spared. School continued in these buildings and the teacherage located next door until the fall of 1947, when the elementary school building was rebuilt and a new high school building had been constructed. [[Potters Hill, North Carolina|Potter's Hill]] Elementary merged with Beulaville in 1960, and [[desegregation|integration]] was implemented shortly after.\n\nBeulaville is home to one elementary/middle school (Beulaville Elementary) and one secondary school (East Duplin High School). The mascot for both schools, as well as nearby B. F. Grady, is the panther, referring to the [[North American cougar|eastern cougar]] which once roamed the swamps and forests of eastern North Carolina. East Duplin High School was built in 1963 and consolidates the elementary schools of Beulaville, B. F. Grady, and Chinquapin.\n\n==Recreation==\n[[File:Banks of the Northeast Cape Fear.JPG|thumb|300px|On the banks of the [[Northeast Cape Fear River]] at [[Hallsville, North Carolina|Hallsville]]]]\n\nSituated {{convert|4|mi|0}} east of the meandering [[Northeast Cape Fear River]], Beulaville offers much in the way of outdoor recreation. There are two boat landings on the Northeast Cape Fear River within a {{convert|7|mi|0|adj=on}} radius of town. The communal landing at [[Hallsville, North Carolina|Hallsville]], which had, for centuries, been used by locals for activities ranging from baptisms to bonfires, has been closed off to the public. The other landing is located west of Beulaville, off Highway 24, half way to Kenansville. Several golf courses can also be found near Beulaville and in the greater Duplin area.\n\nWithin the town limits there are three public parks providing a variety of recreational needs, to include the William Ray Humphrey Athletic Park, a ballpark converted from the former elementary school's recreational fields.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.townofbeulaville.com/parksrecreation.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-12-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125081535/http://www.townofbeulaville.com/parksrecreation.htm |archive-date=2016-01-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The park, located behind the Beulaville Municipal Complex, boasts three baseball fields, two tennis courts, two outdoor basketball courts, and the John Hargett indoor gymnasium.\n\n{{convert|5|mi|0}} north of Beulaville on Highway 111, the 167-acre Cabin Lake County Park attracts many locals and visitors for year-round camping, canoeing, and hiking.<ref>http://www.visitnc.com/listing/cabin-lake-recreational-park</ref> Additionally, the Tarkil Branch Farm Museum at Cedar Fork, {{convert|7|mi|0}} southeast of Beulaville, features a genuine 1830s homestead complete with over 850 artifacts; the operation is situated on a 375-acre working farm.<ref>http://www.tarkilfarmsmuseum.com/index2.htm</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nThe manufacture of [[naval stores]] and lumbering were the first marketable enterprises for the families inhabiting what is now Limestone Creek Township. These commodities were ferried down the Northeast Cape Fear River (which, in the early nineteenth century, had been made navigable) to [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. As demand for naval stores fell, however, the cultivation of corn and, most importantly, [[tobacco]] moved to the forefront. As many of the small-scale tobacco growers dropped out of the market due to [[Tobacco Buyout|tobacco buyouts]], an economic stimulus was needed; it came in the form of hogs. Agriculture is still the economic lifeline of Beulaville (Duplin now boasts the second highest hog-to-human ratio in the country),<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.umich.edu/~snre492/statter.html| title=Environmental Justice Case Study: Hog Farming in North Carolina| publisher=University of Michigan students| accessdate=November 30, 2015}}</ref> though service industries and manufacturing jobs are gradually supplanting this tradition. [[Viticulture]] has noticeably increased throughout the area over the past decade as well. The [[Global TransPark|North Carolina Global TransPark]], a {{convert|2500|acre|adj=on}} multi-modal industrial air terminal, is located {{convert|30|mi}} to the north in Kinston and is a perk for industry to locate to the area. Beulaville has also benefited from its proximity to [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune]] {{convert|35|mi}} to the southeast in both traffic volume on NC 24 en route to [[Interstate 40]] and in job opportunities for citizens.\n[[File:Duplin-county-nc-tobacco-barn-1040875.jpg|thumb|300px|Roadside tobacco barn near Sarecta]]\n[[File:NationalSpinning.jpg|thumb|300px|National Spinning, Beulaville location]]\n\n===Notable nearby employers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The community lies within Limestone Creek Township.\n\n==History==\n\n===Native American presence===\n\nThe earliest Native Americans thought to have roamed the area were the [[Joara]] (whose settlements date back to AD 1000), based out of present-day [[Burke County, North Carolina|Burke County]]. The Joara were the chiefdom of the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] culture. Immediately prior to European colonization in the early 18th century, the coastal plain of North Carolina was home to many distinct Native American tribes: the Coree, Coharie, several small [[Neusiok]] communities, and the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]]. This latter tribe gradually became the most dominant in the region as smaller tribes were either exterminated by Europeans or peacefully assimilated into the Tuscarora for collective security. By the time of permanent European settlement, the Tuscarora were utilizing the heavily forested areas of eastern Duplin County as a hunting ground.\n\nNative American burial mounds are numerous in Duplin County, in the rural areas surrounding Beulaville especially. There are four sizable mounds within a ten-mile radius of the town, the two largest being in the vicinity of [[Hallsville, North Carolina|Hallsville]] and [[Sarecta, North Carolina|Sarecta]]. Combined, these mounds contain roughly one hundred bodies.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/notesonindianbur00holm \"Notes on the Indian burial mounds of eastern North Carolina\"]. Retrieved 2013-11-19.</ref>\n\n===European settlement===\n\nThe arrival of the [[German Palatines|Palatines]] at [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] and the ensuing wave of [[English people|English]] and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] settlers sparked a conflict known as the [[Tuscarora War]] (1710\u20131715). With the elimination of the last [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] stronghold at [[Fort Neoheroka]] and subsequent exodus of the remainder of the tribe to [[New York (state)|New York]] (they became the sixth nation of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]), the interior of the coastal plain was made available for European settlement. Many of the original European settlers of what is now Beulaville arrived from [[Jones County, North Carolina|Jones]], [[Onslow County, North Carolina|Onslow]], [[Beaufort County, North Carolina|Beaufort]], and [[Craven County, North Carolina|Craven]] counties.\n\nIn 1736, Duplin County (then upper [[New Hanover County, North Carolina|New Hanover County]]) was the destination of several hundred [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] (Scotch-Irish) and a handful of [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Protestants]]. They settled on a plot of land, {{convert|71160|acre}} between the [[Northeast Cape Fear River]] and [[Black River (North Carolina)|Black River]], obtained from the Crown by Henry McCulloh of London.<ref>[http://www.carolana.com/NC/Royal_Colony/nc_royal_colony_henry_mcculloch.html]</ref> Their first settlements were Soracta (Sarecta) on the Northeast Cape Fear, an area at the lower end of Goshen Swamp (then called Woodward's Chase), and the grove where the Duplin County Courthouse now stands.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://duplin.lostsoulsgenealogy.com/wd_history.htm| title=Duplin County History to 1810| author=William Dickson| publisher=Duplin County community website| accessdate=November 30, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124201604/http://duplin.lostsoulsgenealogy.com/wd_history.htm| archive-date=January 24, 2016| url-status=dead}}</ref> According to census records, several families of Sarecta and the settlement at the south end of Goshen Swamp had gravitated to the crossroads of what would become Beulaville by the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBeulaville proper was founded as \"Snatchet\" in 1873 out of necessity for a trading center for nearby farmers and those in the business of logging and [[turpentine]] production. Also colloquially referred to as \"Tearshirt\" by locals, the town was once notorious for [[alcoholism]] and frequent street brawls. Indeed, the manufacture and distribution of [[corn liquor]] remained a steady source of income for many families well into the 20th century. Upon demolition of a prominent downtown building (which had formerly served as a soda shop in the 1950s) to make way for a McDonald's, a [[moonshine]] still and several barrels of the drink were uncovered in the basement.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.wral.com| title=Rowdy Town| publisher=WRAL.com |date=February 18, 2008| accessdate=November 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Trains/ICC valuations/Kinston\u2013Carolina Railroad and Lumber Company|Kinston Carolina Railroad and Lumber Company]] constructed a railway from [[Kinston, North Carolina|Kinston]] to [[Pink Hill, North Carolina|Pink Hill]] around 1900. In response, residents of Limestone Creek Township spent $15,000 to lobby for the creation of the \"Duplin County Railroad\" in 1916, extending the Kinston line through Beulaville and [[Chinquapin, North Carolina|Chinquapin]]. The rail, which ran alongside present-day Railroad Street, has since been destroyed.<ref>Report of the Corporation Commission for the Biennial Period ..., Issue 19</ref> The post office of Snatchet was officially re-designated \"Beulaville\" in 1910, and the town was incorporated five years later. The town's name is derived from the Beulah Baptist Church (now the Beulaville Baptist Church). Beulaville is the most recent town to be incorporated in Duplin County.\n[[File:Archie Lanier's Store.jpg|thumb|300px|Archie Lanier's Store]]\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Former Beulaville High School.jpg|thumb|300px|Former Beulaville High School]]\n\nIn 1839, the county passed a tax for the creation of a public school system. Several decades later (sometime around 1870) the first public school in what would become Beulaville was constructed. The facility - which was no more than a small wood cabin - employed only one teacher. By 1901, however, four teachers were working out of the schoolhouse.<ref>[http://www.freefeast.com/userpages/Beulaville1.shtml \"Beulaville, North Carolina: A History\"]. Retrieved 2013-11-19.</ref> In 1906, property was purchased for a new school. A new two-story wooden building was erected and first used in the school year of 1917-1918; the enrollment for that year was nearly 200. Three additions \u2013 the auditorium, gym, and band building \u2013 were added in 1923, and additional tracts of land were purchased for the school between 1933 and 1950. On November 6, 1945, the school's main building burned to the ground. Only the John Hargett Gymnasium and auditorium were spared. School continued in these buildings and the teacherage located next door until the fall of 1947, when the elementary school building was rebuilt and a new high school building had been constructed. [[Potters Hill, North Carolina|Potter's Hill]] Elementary merged with Beulaville in 1960, and [[desegregation|integration]] was implemented shortly after.\n\nBeulaville is home to one elementary/middle school (Beulaville Elementary) and one secondary school (East Duplin High School). The mascot for both schools, as well as nearby B. F. Grady, is the panther, referring to the [[North American cougar|eastern cougar]] which once roamed the swamps and forests of eastern North Carolina. East Duplin High School was built in 1963 and consolidates the elementary schools of Beulaville, B. F. Grady, and Chinquapin.\n\n==Recreation==\n[[File:Banks of the Northeast Cape Fear.JPG|thumb|300px|On the banks of the [[Northeast Cape Fear River]] at [[Hallsville, North Carolina|Hallsville]]]]\n\nSituated {{convert|4|mi|0}} east of the meandering [[Northeast Cape Fear River]], Beulaville offers much in the way of outdoor recreation. There are two boat landings on the Northeast Cape Fear River within a {{convert|7|mi|0|adj=on}} radius of town. The communal landing at [[Hallsville, North Carolina|Hallsville]], which had, for centuries, been used by locals for activities ranging from baptisms to bonfires, has been closed off to the public. The other landing is located west of Beulaville, off Highway 24, half way to Kenansville. Several golf courses can also be found near Beulaville and in the greater Duplin area.\n\nWithin the town limits there are three public parks providing a variety of recreational needs, to include the William Ray Humphrey Athletic Park, a ballpark converted from the former elementary school's recreational fields.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.townofbeulaville.com/parksrecreation.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-12-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125081535/http://www.townofbeulaville.com/parksrecreation.htm |archive-date=2016-01-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The park, located behind the Beulaville Municipal Complex, boasts three baseball fields, two tennis courts, two outdoor basketball courts, and the John Hargett indoor gymnasium.\n\n{{convert|5|mi|0}} north of Beulaville on Highway 111, the 167-acre Cabin Lake County Park attracts many locals and visitors for year-round camping, canoeing, and hiking.<ref>http://www.visitnc.com/listing/cabin-lake-recreational-park</ref> Additionally, the Tarkil Branch Farm Museum at Cedar Fork, {{convert|7|mi|0}} southeast of Beulaville, features a genuine 1830s homestead complete with over 850 artifacts; the operation is situated on a 375-acre working farm.<ref>http://www.tarkilfarmsmuseum.com/index2.htm</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nThe manufacture of [[naval stores]] and lumbering were the first marketable enterprises for the families inhabiting what is now Limestone Creek Township. These commodities were ferried down the Northeast Cape Fear River (which, in the early nineteenth century, had been made navigable) to [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. As demand for naval stores fell, however, the cultivation of corn and, most importantly, [[tobacco]] moved to the forefront. As many of the small-scale tobacco growers dropped out of the market due to [[Tobacco Buyout|tobacco buyouts]], an economic stimulus was needed; it came in the form of hogs. Agriculture is still the economic lifeline of Beulaville (Duplin now boasts the second highest hog-to-human ratio in the country),<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.umich.edu/~snre492/statter.html| title=Environmental Justice Case Study: Hog Farming in North Carolina| publisher=University of Michigan students| accessdate=November 30, 2015}}</ref> though service industries and manufacturing jobs are gradually supplanting this tradition. [[Viticulture]] has noticeably increased throughout the area over the past decade as well. The [[Global TransPark|North Carolina Global TransPark]], a {{convert|2500|acre|adj=on}} multi-modal industrial air terminal, is located {{convert|30|mi}} to the north in Kinston and is a perk for industry to locate to the area. Beulaville has also benefited from its proximity to [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune]] {{convert|35|mi}} to the southeast in both traffic volume on NC 24 en route to [[Interstate 40]] and in job opportunities for citizens.\n[[File:Duplin-county-nc-tobacco-barn-1040875.jpg|thumb|300px|Roadside tobacco barn near Sarecta]]\n[[File:NationalSpinning.jpg|thumb|300px|National Spinning, Beulaville location]]\n\n===Notable nearby employers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
