The character was created by [[Lee Falk]] for the adventure [[comic strip]] ''[[The Phantom]]'', which debuted in newspapers on February 17, 1936.

[[Tony DePaul]] and [[Claes Reimerthi]] alternated as writers of the daily and Sunday newspaper strips, respectively. DePaul would later become the sole writer of the strip.\n\nIn 2000, Olesen and Fredericks retired from the Sunday strip, which was then taken over by artist [[Graham Nolan]]. Olesen and Williams left the daily strip after Olesen retired, and artist [[Paul Ryan (cartoonist)|Paul Ryan]] took over the daily in early 2005.

Because he seems to have existed for generations, many believe him to be immortal. In reality, the Phantom is a [[legacy hero]], descended from 20 previous generations of crimefighters who all adopt the same persona. When a new Phantom takes the task from his dying father, he swears the Oath of the Skull: \"I swear to devote my life to the destruction of piracy, greed, cruelty, and injustice, in all their forms, and my sons and their sons shall follow me\". The first Phantom married Christina, the daughter of a Scandinavian sea captain, Eric the Rover. The second Phantom married Marabella, the granddaughter of [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref>''The name'', by Lee Falk Issue 1,000 1979</ref>\n\nThe comic sometimes runs [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] adventures of previous Phantoms written by various authors who sometimes confuse Phantom history. Current stories have Marabella as the daughter of Columbus and marrying the first Phantom.<ref>''Captain Walkers Log Book'', by Claes Reimerthi No. 1141</ref><ref>''Marabella'', by Claes Reimerthi No. 1192</ref> As Columbus died in 1506 while, according to the new history, Marabella first meets the Phantom in 1544, this results in another inconsistency, requiring her to be at least 38 years old despite being depicted as in her early 20s. Inconsistencies in storylines and histories are not corrected as a mark of respect to authors, but Falk's original history takes precedence.<ref>''The Marabella Mystery'', by Jim Shepherd No. 1192</ref>\n\nAlthough most of the Phantoms have been male, there has been one woman who took up the role: Julie Walker, twin sister of the 17th Phantom. While her brother\nwas injured, Julie donned the Phantom costume and defeated a band of pirates.<ref>\"The Female Phantom\", by Lee Falk and Wilson McCoy, July 20 \u2013 October 12, 1952.</ref><ref>\"The Adventures of the Girl Phantom\", by Dick Wood and Bill Lignante. ''The Phantom'' #20, King Comics, January 1967.</ref>\n\nThe present Phantom is the 21st in the line. Unlike most costumed heroes, he has no [[superhuman]] powers, relying only on his wits, physical strength, skill with his weapons, and fearsome reputation to fight crime. His real name is '''Kit Walker'''. References to \"'''Mr. Walker'''\" are in the strip often accompanied by a footnote saying \"For 'The Ghost Who Walks'\", although some versions of the Phantom's history suggest that Walker was actually the original surname of the man who became the first Phantom.\n\n===Origin===\nThe story of the Phantom started with a young sailor named Christopher Walker (sometimes called Christopher Standish in certain versions of the story<ref>''The Singh Brotherhood'' (1936), by Lee Falk and Ray Moore</ref>). Christopher was born in 1516 in [[Portsmouth]].<ref>The First Phantom (Fantomet #10/1985), by Claes Reimerthi and Kari Lepp\u00e4nen</ref> His father, also named Christopher Walker, had been a seaman since he was a young boy, and was the cabin boy on [[Christopher Columbus]]' ship, the ''[[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|Santa Mar\u00eda]]'', when he sailed to the Americas. Christopher Jr. became a shipboy on his father's ship in 1526.\n\nIn 1536, when Christopher was 20 years old, he was a part of what was supposed to be his father's last voyage. The ship was attacked by pirates and Christopher's father was murdered. He was the sole survivor and was washed ashore on a Bengalla beach, where he was found by pygmies of the Bandar tribe, who nursed him back to health and took care of him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weirdscifi.ratiosemper.com/phantom/about.html |title=The Phantom \u2013 For Those Who Came in Late |publisher=Weirdscifi.ratiosemper.com |accessdate=2011-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724032727/http://weirdscifi.ratiosemper.com/phantom/about.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}</ref> He vows revenge on \"the destruction of piracy, greed, cruelty, and injustice, in all their forms!\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Lasiuta |first=Tim |url=http://thenostalgialeague.com/cr/phantom.html |title=The Phantom is Dead...Long Live the Phantom |publisher=Thenostalgialeague.com |accessdate=2011-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225121248/http://www.thenostalgialeague.com/cr/phantom.html |archivedate=February 25, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe Bandars showed Christopher to a cave, which resembled a human skull in appearance.

When he died, his son took over for him, when the second Phantom died, his son took over, and so on. So it would go on through the centuries, causing people to believe that the Phantom was immortal. These people gave him nicknames including \"The Ghost Who Walks\" and \"The Man Who Cannot Die\".<ref>''The First Phantom'' (1975), by Lee Falk and Sy Barry</ref>\n\nHis base is in the Deep Woods of Bengali (originally \"Bengalla\", or \"[[Bangalla]]\" and renamed ''Denkali'' in the Indian edition<ref name=\"wsbm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?207314 |title=White Skin, Black Mask |publisher=www.outlookindia.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref>), a [[fictional country]] initially said to be set in Asia, near India, but depicted as in Africa during and after the 1960s. The Phantom's base is the fabled [[Skull Cave]], where all of the previous Phantoms are buried.\n\nThe Phantom is the commander of Bangalla's Jungle Patrol.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weirdscifi.ratiosemper.com/phantom/strip.html |title=The Phantom \u2013 The Comic Strip |publisher=Weirdscifi.ratiosemper.com |date=February 17, 1936 |accessdate=2011-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724032757/http://weirdscifi.ratiosemper.com/phantom/strip.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}</ref> Because of a betrayal leading to the death of the 14th Phantom, the identity of the commander has been kept hidden from members of the patrol ever since. The Phantom uses several ways to stay in contact. These include radio and a safe with a false bottom.\n[[File:LocationPhantom.png|left|300px|thumb|Map of countries printing ''The Phantom''. Green countries have regular ''Phantom'' publications, while blue countries print the dailies/Sundays in newspapers.]]\n\n===Kit Walker, the 21st Phantom===\nThe 21st Phantom's birth name is Kit Walker, as was the name of many of the Phantoms before him. Kit was born in the [[Skull Cave]] and spent his first years in the jungle of Bangalla. His mother, Maud Thorne McPatrick, who had previously worked as [[Rita Hayworth]]'s stunt double, was born in Mississippi, where Kit was sent to study when he was 12 years old, living with his aunt Lucy and uncle Jasper in the town of [[Clarksville, Missouri]].\n\nHere he met his wife-to-be, [[Diana Palmer (The Phantom)|Diana Palmer]]. Kit was an extremely talented sportsman and was predicted to become the world champion in many different events (even knocking out the world heavyweight boxing champion in a sparring match when the champion visited Clarksville). Despite the opportunity to choose practically any career he wanted, Kit faithfully returned to Bengalla to take over the role of the Phantom when he received word from Guran that his father was dying from a knife-wound.<ref>\"Childhood of the Phantom\" (1959) by Lee Falk and Wilson McCoy</ref>\n\nOne of Kit's first missions as the Phantom was to find his father's killer, Rama Singh, who had betrayed and murdered the 20th Phantom by first helping him to blow up a fleet of ships owned by the Singh Brotherhood, only to then stab him in the back, stealing his special gunbelt in the process. The 21st Phantom eventually found him and reclaimed the belt at the island of Gullique, but before he could avenge his father and bring the killer to jail, the desperate Rama blew up his lair, killing himself and his henchmen in the process.<ref>\"The Belt\" (1954) by Lee Falk and Wilson McCoy</ref>\n\nThe Phantom has two animal helpers, a mountain wolf named Devil and a horse named Hero. He also has a trained falcon named Fraka. From 1962 on, The Phantom raised an orphan named \"Rex King\", who was later revealed to be the prince of the kingdom of Baronkhan. He also has two dolphins named Solomon and Nefertiti, and numerous other animals kept on the island of Eden.\n\nIn 1978, he married his sweetheart, Diana Palmer, who works at the United Nations. The Phantom and Diana have two children, Kit and Heloise.<ref>\"The Name\" by Lee Falk and Sy Barry. September 9 \u2013 December 9, 1979.</ref> His chief aide and ally is [[Guran]], chief of the local [[pygmy]] Bandar tribe, who are the only tribe to know the Phantom's true nature. Guran is the Phantom's best friend since childhood and a supporter of his cause. Other allies of the 21st Phantom include Doctor Axel, a Scandinavian doctor working in Bangalla,<ref>\"Dr. Axel and the Witchmen\", Lee Falk and Wilson McCoy, August 1 \u2013 October 8, 1955.</ref> and Miss Tagama, the African teacher of Rex, Kit and Heloise.<ref>\"Yes\", Lee Falk and Sy Barry, December 7, 1970 \u2013 February 13, 1971.</ref>\n\n===Costume and weapons===\nAs part of the official uniform, the Phantom wears a black [[domino mask]] and a purple skintight bodysuit. He also carries period-appropriate [[Sidearm (weapon)|sidearms]], currently two [[M1911 pistol]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/ComradesInArms/comics/phantom/phantom.htm |title=The Phantom -adapted by Corinth |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref> in a special belt with a skull-like buckle. Falk has insisted that the Phantom only uses his guns to shoot out the guns of his opponents, a fact that writer [[Peter David]] was unaware of when he wrote [[DC Comics]]' 1988 four-issue ''Phantom'' [[miniseries]], in which he had the Phantom shoot to wound his enemies.<ref>Peter David. \"But I Digress...\" ''Comics Buyer's Guide '' #1325; April 9, 1999; Page 58</ref> However, there are some early instances (in the Lee Falk strips) of the Phantom using his guns to shoot and kill people (sometimes in self-defense).\n\nWhile there had been masked crime fighters like the costumed [[Zorro]], [[The Shadow]], or the business-suited [[Clock (comics)|The Clock]], the Phantom was the first fictional character to wear the skintight costume and eyes with no visible pupils that has become a trademark of [[superheroes]]. Creator Lee Falk had originally envisioned a gray costume and even considered naming his creation \"The Gray Ghost\". It was not until the Phantom [[Sunday strip]] debuted in 1939 that the costume was shown to be purple. Falk, however, continued to refer to the costume as gray in the text of the strip on several occasions afterward, but finally accepted the purple color.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deepwoods.org/purple.html |title=The Phantom Reference Guide: \"A Purple Phantom?\", by Bryan Shedden |publisher=Deepwoods.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref> In a Sunday strip story published in the 1960s it was shown that the first Phantom chose the costume based on the appearance of a jungle idol, and colored the cloth with purple jungle berries.\n\nAs part of a modernization of the character in the Moonstone Books' series, ''The Phantom: Ghost Who Walks'', the Phantom began wearing a costume made of [[kevlar]].<ref>Tate, Ray.

One has a pattern formed like four crossing sabres, \"The Good Mark\", that he leaves on visitors whom he befriends, placing the person under his protection. The other, \"The Evil Mark\" or \"Skull Mark\" has a skull shape, which leaves a scar of the corresponding shape on the enemies he punches with it. He wears the Good Mark on his left hand because it is closer to the heart, and the Evil Mark on his right hand. According to the Team Fantomen stories, the Skull Ring was given to the first Phantom by [[Paracelsus]].<ref>\"The Ring\" by Ulf Granberg and Jaime Vallv\u00e9, ''The Phantom'', Frew Publications, December 20, 2002.</ref> The original owner of the Skull Ring was [[Emperor Nero]] of the [[Roman empire]] and it would later be revealed that the ring had been made from the nails that hung Jesus to the cross. The Good Mark ring was made after the sixth Phantom founded the Jungle Patrol.<ref>''The ring of Death'', by Claes Reimerthi and Kari Lepp\u00e4nnen</ref>\n\n===Enemies===\nThe most dangerous and lasting enemy of the Phantom is the Singh Brotherhood, active for centuries and responsible for the death of the 21st Phantom's father.<ref name=\"hhc\">Hubert H.

Katzman, having been forced to delete many of the action scenes from ''The Phantom'', filled the gaps with scenes from two more old serials, ''[[The Desert Hawk (serial)|The Desert Hawk]]'' and ''[[Jungle Menace]]''.

The Phantom had also been frequently parodied on Scandinavian television, in different humor programs.\n\nIn 1984, Australian stand-up comedian [[Austen Tayshus]] released a single ''Phantom Shuffle''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Austen-Tayshus-Phantom-Shuffle/release/1167548 |title=Austen Tayshus \u2013 Phantom Shuffle |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref> in the video of which he appeared in Phantom costume, wearing sunglasses instead of a mask. Many elements of the Phantom myth were parodied, such as him being \"Mr Walker, the man who cannot drive\".\n\nIn 2017, Australian comedian [[Sammy J]] began touring with a new show, ''Hero Complex'', in which he pays tribute to what he says is the role the Phantom has played in his life: \"a chance encounter set off a chain of events that led to me meeting my wife and ended with police searching my attic\".<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/mar/28/sammy-j-the-phantom-may-be-a-dud-superhero-but-he-changed-my-life</ref> ''Hero Complex'' has won a \"Best Comedy\" award or nomination in every festival in which it has featured.\n\nIn the [[Adult Swim]] show ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', the character [[Phantom Limb (character)|The Phantom Limb]] bears a strong visual resemblance to the Phantom, right down to the same purple suit and mask, except that the Phantom Limb's limbs are invisible, making him look like a floating torso. However, The Phantom Limb is a villainous character.\n\nThe myth surrounding the Phantom also provided Turkish humorists with a lot of material. The humor magazine ''[[Leman (magazine)|Leman]]'' has published many comic strips some of which were inspired by the (imaginary) saying \"in the jungle, it is rumored that the Phantom has the strength of ten tigers\" where Phantom runs into trouble with 11 or more tigers.\n\nThe Phantom was parodied in a 2007 episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' titled \"[[Werewolf vs. Unicorn]]\", where he appeared alongside Flash Gordon and Mandrake the Magician. He was voiced by [[Frank Welker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1084806/|title=Werewolf vs. Unicorn|date=August 12, 2007|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Phantom was a frequently appearing character in the Finnish [[comic strip]] ''[[Fingerpori]]'' by [[Pertti Jarla]]. He was often involved in humorous situations such as using his throne as a toilet seat.\n\n====Documentaries====\nIn 1996, the [[A&E Network]] created a documentary about the history of the Phantom for television, called ''The Phantom: Comic Strip Crusader''. Narrated by [[Peter Graves (actor)|Peter Graves]], it featured interviews with creator Lee Falk, actors [[Billy Zane]] and [[Kristy Swanson]], director [[Simon Wincer]], Frew-editor Jim Shepherd, George Olesen, Keith Williams, and president of the US Phantom fan club ''Friends of the Phantom'', Ed Rhoades. The documentary was released on DVD in 2006.\n\nTo promote the 1996 Paramount Phantom movie, an [[HBO]] special called \"Making of The Phantom\" was made. It featured behind-the-scenes information on the movie and the comic.\n\nAn original documentary presentation called ''History of the Phantom'' was shown at the [[Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention]] in September 2008.\n\n====''MythBusters'' \"Superhero Hour\"====\nOn ''[[MythBusters]]'' season 5, episode 17 \"Superhero Hour\", it was tested whether the Phantom's skull ring would make an imprint on someone when you punch them while wearing it, as it did in the comic. The result was that the myth was \"busted\", in that hitting a person in the face hard enough to leave a ring imprint on the skin required more than enough force to crush a human skull.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythbustersresults.com/episode86 |title=MythBusters Episode 86: Superhero Hour |publisher=Mythbustersresults.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the comic, it had been revealed that the Phantom's ring actually had sharp edges and was covered with a permanent ink synthesized from plants found in the depths of the Bengallan jungle, leaving a permanent scar-like mark. It was, in effect, an instant tattoo.\n\n===Video games===\n{{See also|Phantom 2040 (video game)}}\nThe Phantom has appeared as a playable character in two video games, ''[[Phantom 2040 (video game)|Phantom 2040]]'' and ''[[Defenders of the Earth]]''. Both were based on the animated series with the same titles. However, in Defenders of the Earth, the Phantom was not the only [[Player character|playable character]], as players were given the choice to control Mandrake the Magician and Flash Gordon as well.\n\nIn ''Phantom 2040'', released on [[Sega Genesis]], [[Game Gear]], and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], the Phantom was the only playable character. He had use of a number of his special skills and high-tech gadgets from the Phantom 2040 TV-series. The game had a complex storyline and featured several different endings, which were dependent on the choices the player made during the game.\n\nIn 2003, a video game made for [[Game Boy Advance]] was announced, called \"The Phantom: The Ghost Who Walks\". It was developed by [[7th Sense]] and produced by Microids, and it was described as a free-roaming jungle adventure.<ref>{{cite web|last=Calvert |first=Justin |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/adventure/phantomtheghostwhowalks/news.html?sid=2901655&om_act=convert&om_clk=gsupdates&tag=updates;title;2 |title=First look: The Phantom: The Ghost Who Walks \u2013 Game Boy Advance News |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=December 13, 2002 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref> During the development process, Microids went bankrupt, and the game was never released.\n\nIn 2006, The Phantom Mobile Game became available for cellphones, where the Phantom fought zombies, floating skulls, and other magical creatures to find his kidnapped wife, Diana Palmer.

Because he seems to have existed for generations, many believe him to be immortal. In reality, the Phantom is a [[legacy hero]], descended from 20 previous generations of crimefighters who all adopt the same persona. When a new Phantom takes the task from his dying father, he swears the Oath of the Skull: \"I swear to devote my life to the destruction of piracy, greed, cruelty, and injustice, in all their forms, and my sons and their sons shall follow me\". The first Phantom married Christina, the daughter of a Scandinavian sea captain, Eric the Rover. The second Phantom married Marabella, the granddaughter of [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref>''The name'', by Lee Falk Issue 1,000 1979</ref>\n\nThe comic sometimes runs [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] adventures of previous Phantoms written by various authors who sometimes confuse Phantom history. Current stories have Marabella as the daughter of Columbus and marrying the first Phantom.<ref>''Captain Walkers Log Book'', by Claes Reimerthi No. 1141</ref><ref>''Marabella'', by Claes Reimerthi No. 1192</ref> As Columbus died in 1506 while, according to the new history, Marabella first meets the Phantom in 1544, this results in another inconsistency, requiring her to be at least 38 years old despite being depicted as in her early 20s. Inconsistencies in storylines and histories are not corrected as a mark of respect to authors, but Falk's original history takes precedence.<ref>''The Marabella Mystery'', by Jim Shepherd No. 1192</ref>\n\nAlthough most of the Phantoms have been male, there has been one woman who took up the role: Julie Walker, twin sister of the 17th Phantom. While her brother\nwas injured, Julie donned the Phantom costume and defeated a band of pirates.<ref>\"The Female Phantom\", by Lee Falk and Wilson McCoy, July 20 \u2013 October 12, 1952.</ref><ref>\"The Adventures of the Girl Phantom\", by Dick Wood and Bill Lignante. ''The Phantom'' #20, King Comics, January 1967.</ref>\n\nThe present Phantom is the 21st in the line. Unlike most costumed heroes, he has no [[superhuman]] powers, relying only on his wits, physical strength, skill with his weapons, and fearsome reputation to fight crime. His real name is '''Kit Walker'''. References to \"'''Mr. Walker'''\" are in the strip often accompanied by a footnote saying \"For 'The Ghost Who Walks'\", although some versions of the Phantom's history suggest that Walker was actually the original surname of the man who became the first Phantom.\n\n===Origin===\nThe story of the Phantom started with a young sailor named Christopher Walker (sometimes called Christopher Standish in certain versions of the story<ref>''The Singh Brotherhood'' (1936), by Lee Falk and Ray Moore</ref>). Christopher was born in 1516 in [[Portsmouth]].<ref>The First Phantom (Fantomet #10/1985), by Claes Reimerthi and Kari Lepp\u00e4nen</ref> His father, also named Christopher Walker, had been a seaman since he was a young boy, and was the cabin boy on [[Christopher Columbus]]' ship, the ''[[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|Santa Mar\u00eda]]'', when he sailed to the Americas. Christopher Jr. became a shipboy on his father's ship in 1526.\n\nIn 1536, when Christopher was 20 years old, he was a part of what was supposed to be his father's last voyage. The ship was attacked by pirates and Christopher's father was murdered. He was the sole survivor and was washed ashore on a Bengalla beach, where he was found by pygmies of the Bandar tribe, who nursed him back to health and took care of him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weirdscifi.ratiosemper.com/phantom/about.html |title=The Phantom \u2013 For Those Who Came in Late |publisher=Weirdscifi.ratiosemper.com |accessdate=2011-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724032727/http://weirdscifi.ratiosemper.com/phantom/about.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}</ref> He vows revenge on \"the destruction of piracy, greed, cruelty, and injustice, in all their forms!\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Lasiuta |first=Tim |url=http://thenostalgialeague.com/cr/phantom.html |title=The Phantom is Dead...Long Live the Phantom |publisher=Thenostalgialeague.com |accessdate=2011-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225121248/http://www.thenostalgialeague.com/cr/phantom.html |archivedate=February 25, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe Bandars showed Christopher to a cave, which resembled a human skull in appearance.

When he died, his son took over for him, when the second Phantom died, his son took over, and so on. So it would go on through the centuries, causing people to believe that the Phantom was immortal. These people gave him nicknames including \"The Ghost Who Walks\" and \"The Man Who Cannot Die\".<ref>''The First Phantom'' (1975), by Lee Falk and Sy Barry</ref>\n\nHis base is in the Deep Woods of Bengali (originally \"Bengalla\", or \"[[Bangalla]]\" and renamed ''Denkali'' in the Indian edition<ref name=\"wsbm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?207314 |title=White Skin, Black Mask |publisher=www.outlookindia.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref>), a [[fictional country]] initially said to be set in Asia, near India, but depicted as in Africa during and after the 1960s.

Green countries have regular ''Phantom'' publications, while blue countries print the dailies/Sundays in newspapers.]]\n\n===Kit Walker, the 21st Phantom===\nThe 21st Phantom's birth name is Kit Walker, as was the name of many of the Phantoms before him. Kit was born in the [[Skull Cave]] and spent his first years in the jungle of Bangalla. His mother, Maud Thorne McPatrick, who had previously worked as [[Rita Hayworth]]'s stunt double, was born in Mississippi, where Kit was sent to study when he was 12 years old, living with his aunt Lucy and uncle Jasper in the town of [[Clarksville, Missouri]].\n\nHere he met his wife-to-be, [[Diana Palmer (The Phantom)|Diana Palmer]]. Kit was an extremely talented sportsman and was predicted to become the world champion in many different events (even knocking out the world heavyweight boxing champion in a sparring match when the champion visited Clarksville). Despite the opportunity to choose practically any career he wanted, Kit faithfully returned to Bengalla to take over the role of the Phantom when he received word from Guran that his father was dying from a knife-wound.<ref>\"Childhood of the Phantom\" (1959) by Lee Falk and Wilson McCoy</ref>\n\nOne of Kit's first missions as the Phantom was to find his father's killer, Rama Singh, who had betrayed and murdered the 20th Phantom by first helping him to blow up a fleet of ships owned by the Singh Brotherhood, only to then stab him in the back, stealing his special gunbelt in the process. The 21st Phantom eventually found him and reclaimed the belt at the island of Gullique, but before he could avenge his father and bring the killer to jail, the desperate Rama blew up his lair, killing himself and his henchmen in the process.<ref>\"The Belt\" (1954) by Lee Falk and Wilson McCoy</ref>\n\nThe Phantom has two animal helpers, a mountain wolf named Devil and a horse named Hero. He also has a trained falcon named Fraka. From 1962 on, The Phantom raised an orphan named \"Rex King\", who was later revealed to be the prince of the kingdom of Baronkhan. He also has two dolphins named Solomon and Nefertiti, and numerous other animals kept on the island of Eden.\n\nIn 1978, he married his sweetheart, Diana Palmer, who works at the United Nations. The Phantom and Diana have two children, Kit and Heloise.<ref>\"The Name\" by Lee Falk and Sy Barry. September 9 \u2013 December 9, 1979.</ref> His chief aide and ally is [[Guran]], chief of the local [[pygmy]] Bandar tribe, who are the only tribe to know the Phantom's true nature. Guran is the Phantom's best friend since childhood and a supporter of his cause. Other allies of the 21st Phantom include Doctor Axel, a Scandinavian doctor working in Bangalla,<ref>\"Dr. Axel and the Witchmen\", Lee Falk and Wilson McCoy, August 1 \u2013 October 8, 1955.</ref> and Miss Tagama, the African teacher of Rex, Kit and Heloise.<ref>\"Yes\", Lee Falk and Sy Barry, December 7, 1970 \u2013 February 13, 1971.</ref>\n\n===Costume and weapons===\nAs part of the official uniform, the Phantom wears a black [[domino mask]] and a purple skintight bodysuit. He also carries period-appropriate [[Sidearm (weapon)|sidearms]], currently two [[M1911 pistol]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/ComradesInArms/comics/phantom/phantom.htm |title=The Phantom -adapted by Corinth |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref> in a special belt with a skull-like buckle. Falk has insisted that the Phantom only uses his guns to shoot out the guns of his opponents, a fact that writer [[Peter David]] was unaware of when he wrote [[DC Comics]]' 1988 four-issue ''Phantom'' [[miniseries]], in which he had the Phantom shoot to wound his enemies.<ref>Peter David. \"But I Digress...\" ''Comics Buyer's Guide '' #1325; April 9, 1999; Page 58</ref> However, there are some early instances (in the Lee Falk strips) of the Phantom using his guns to shoot and kill people (sometimes in self-defense).\n\nWhile there had been masked crime fighters like the costumed [[Zorro]], [[The Shadow]], or the business-suited [[Clock (comics)|The Clock]], the Phantom was the first fictional character to wear the skintight costume and eyes with no visible pupils that has become a trademark of [[superheroes]]. Creator Lee Falk had originally envisioned a gray costume and even considered naming his creation \"The Gray Ghost\". It was not until the Phantom [[Sunday strip]] debuted in 1939 that the costume was shown to be purple. Falk, however, continued to refer to the costume as gray in the text of the strip on several occasions afterward, but finally accepted the purple color.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deepwoods.org/purple.html |title=The Phantom Reference Guide: \"A Purple Phantom?\", by Bryan Shedden |publisher=Deepwoods.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref> In a Sunday strip story published in the 1960s it was shown that the first Phantom chose the costume based on the appearance of a jungle idol, and colored the cloth with purple jungle berries.\n\nAs part of a modernization of the character in the Moonstone Books' series, ''The Phantom: Ghost Who Walks'', the Phantom began wearing a costume made of [[kevlar]].<ref>Tate, Ray.

One has a pattern formed like four crossing sabres, \"The Good Mark\", that he leaves on visitors whom he befriends, placing the person under his protection. The other, \"The Evil Mark\" or \"Skull Mark\" has a skull shape, which leaves a scar of the corresponding shape on the enemies he punches with it. He wears the Good Mark on his left hand because it is closer to the heart, and the Evil Mark on his right hand. According to the Team Fantomen stories, the Skull Ring was given to the first Phantom by [[Paracelsus]].<ref>\"The Ring\" by Ulf Granberg and Jaime Vallv\u00e9, ''The Phantom'', Frew Publications, December 20, 2002.</ref> The original owner of the Skull Ring was [[Emperor Nero]] of the [[Roman empire]] and it would later be revealed that the ring had been made from the nails that hung Jesus to the cross. The Good Mark ring was made after the sixth Phantom founded the Jungle Patrol.<ref>''The ring of Death'', by Claes Reimerthi and Kari Lepp\u00e4nnen</ref>\n\n===Enemies===\nThe most dangerous and lasting enemy of the Phantom is the Singh Brotherhood, active for centuries and responsible for the death of the 21st Phantom's father.<ref name=\"hhc\">Hubert H.

Unfortunately Katzman failed to check with the studio's legal department, and found that its rights to the Phantom character had lapsed. Katzman, unwilling to meet the rights holder's high price, reshot much of the action with Hart in a vaguely similar costume (helmet, mask, sweater, and riding breeches) to match the old footage with Tom Tyler.

Many elements of the Phantom myth were parodied, such as him being \"Mr Walker, the man who cannot drive\".\n\nIn 2017, Australian comedian [[Sammy J]] began touring with a new show, ''Hero Complex'', in which he pays tribute to what he says is the role the Phantom has played in his life: \"a chance encounter set off a chain of events that led to me meeting my wife and ended with police searching my attic\".<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/mar/28/sammy-j-the-phantom-may-be-a-dud-superhero-but-he-changed-my-life</ref> ''Hero Complex'' has won a \"Best Comedy\" award or nomination in every festival in which it has featured.\n\nIn the [[Adult Swim]] show ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', the character [[Phantom Limb (character)|The Phantom Limb]] bears a strong visual resemblance to the Phantom, right down to the same purple suit and mask, except that the Phantom Limb's limbs are invisible, making him look like a floating torso. However, The Phantom Limb is a villainous character.\n\nThe myth surrounding the Phantom also provided Turkish humorists with a lot of material. The humor magazine ''[[Leman (magazine)|Leman]]'' has published many comic strips some of which were inspired by the (imaginary) saying \"in the jungle, it is rumored that the Phantom has the strength of ten tigers\" where Phantom runs into trouble with 11 or more tigers.\n\nThe Phantom was parodied in a 2007 episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' titled \"[[Werewolf vs. Unicorn]]\", where he appeared alongside Flash Gordon and Mandrake the Magician. He was voiced by [[Frank Welker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1084806/|title=Werewolf vs. Unicorn|date=August 12, 2007|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Phantom was a frequently appearing character in the Finnish [[comic strip]] ''[[Fingerpori]]'' by [[Pertti Jarla]]. He was often involved in humorous situations such as using his throne as a toilet seat.\n\n====Documentaries====\nIn 1996, the [[A&E Network]] created a documentary about the history of the Phantom for television, called ''The Phantom: Comic Strip Crusader''.

The documentary was released on DVD in 2006.\n\nTo promote the 1996 Paramount Phantom movie, an [[HBO]] special called \"Making of The Phantom\" was made. It featured behind-the-scenes information on the movie and the comic.\n\nAn original documentary presentation called ''History of the Phantom'' was shown at the [[Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention]] in September 2008.\n\n====''MythBusters'' \"Superhero Hour\"====\nOn ''[[MythBusters]]'' season 5, episode 17 \"Superhero Hour\", it was tested whether the Phantom's skull ring would make an imprint on someone when you punch them while wearing it, as it did in the comic. The result was that the myth was \"busted\", in that hitting a person in the face hard enough to leave a ring imprint on the skin required more than enough force to crush a human skull.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythbustersresults.com/episode86 |title=MythBusters Episode 86: Superhero Hour |publisher=Mythbustersresults.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the comic, it had been revealed that the Phantom's ring actually had sharp edges and was covered with a permanent ink synthesized from plants found in the depths of the Bengallan jungle, leaving a permanent scar-like mark. It was, in effect, an instant tattoo.\n\n===Video games===\n{{See also|Phantom 2040 (video game)}}\nThe Phantom has appeared as a playable character in two video games, ''[[Phantom 2040 (video game)|Phantom 2040]]'' and ''[[Defenders of the Earth]]''.

The members of this organisation had met the day before the exams in a tavern, to discuss the actions. <ref>[http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?apm=0&aid=nfp&datum=19250507&seite=1&zoom=2 Revolversch\u00fcsse und Bombenw\u00fcrfe gegen Lehrer], ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]'' (May 7, 1925)</ref><ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A16FF3B5B12738DDDAE0894DD405B858EF1D3 Bomb Kills Three Boy Raiders Who Shoot Up Vilna School], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (May 7, 1925)</ref>\n|-\n| May 18, 1927\n| [[Bath, Michigan]], United States\n| [[Andrew Kehoe]], 55\n| 45\n| 58\n| [[Bath School disaster]].

The film stars husband and wife actors [[Patrick J. Adams]] and [[Troian Bellisario]], playing astrophysicist Isaac and itinerant artist Clara, who become close while searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe. The film is grounded in recent technological and theoretical advances, and attracted the attention of astronomers. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and out of a handful of nominations from various bodies, won an award from the [[Austin Film Festival]], \n\n==Plot==\nDr. Isaac Bruno holds a postdoctoral research fellowship in astrophysics at (fictional) Ontario University, in [[Toronto]]. His goal of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe has become an obsession, linked to an unspecified trauma in his personal life two years earlier. He has become increasingly antagonistic towards his students and has taken to misappropriating time on ground-based telescopes in Chile, intended for a colleague's research. His department head suspends him, denying him any access to the school's research facilities.\n\nThe [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] orbiting telescope is launched, providing enormous amounts of data that is shared with the world, in a community effort to analyze and find possible life on [[exoplanet]]s. Isaac posts flyers looking for an unpaid research assistant, offering nothing but room and board. His only response is from Clara, an uneducated artist who has lived a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian lifestyle]]. Clara has her own secrets, seen taking some type of medicine for an unspecified issue.\n\nIsaac focuses on results from [[Red dwarf|M dwarf]] stars, believing it to be a niche that no one else will bother with. When Clara finds a promising exoplanet, Isaac sneaks into the university in the night and lies to the telescope operators in Chile, claiming to have permission from his friend Charlie, to get more data on the planet.\n\nCharlie is furious, but also intrigued by the data results. He advises Isaac to contact Rebecca, Isaac's ex-wife, who holds an endowed chair at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Clara convinces Isaac to contact Rebecca, despite his reluctance. The upheaval in their lives is finally revealed, when Rebecca tells Isaac that finding life will not bring back their dead baby son. She gets him some time on the [[W. M.

This results in proving that they have found a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet candidate]].\n\nClara is falling in love with Isaac, but he has become jaded about love or anything else that can not be scientifically proven. She kisses him, then abruptly backs off when he starts to respond. When Charlie's wife has a baby, Isaac pontificates on how a minuscule change took his own son, and could equally change the entire universe. Clara reminds him that those same minuscule changes did result in his son existing at all. This leads to them finally becoming a couple. \n\nWhen they learn that someone else discovered \u201ctheir\u201d planet a week before them, Isaac becomes despondent. He soon decides to focus on finding direct evidence of life, rather than just a potentially habitable planet. In his obsession, he is blind to Clara's declining health, until Charlie chastises him. Isaac tells Clara it is time for him to stop his search, but she makes him ignore the data and focus on his inner connection to the universe. He is surprised when it works, but rejects it and her. She grabs her bag to leave - and collapses.\n\nAt the hospital, it is revealed that Clara has an autoimmune disease that is causing the complete breakdown of every organ and muscle in her body. The doctors are shocked that she can even walk or talk, and confirm she will soon be dead. Isaac stays at her bedside for her last few days. Moments before she dies, she tells him he is going to \u201csee it\u201d.\n\nA fresh batch of TESS data is released, and Isaac does \u201csee it\u201d - proof of a seemingly artificial object in coincident orbit with an exoplanet. He takes his findings to Charlie, who introduces him to Dr. Rickman, head of the TESS project. Two years later, at a press conference at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], Dr. Rickman, Rebecca and Charlie explain that the data gathered now conclusively proves the existence of the artificial object, orbiting a star 200 light years distant, in turn proving the existence of intelligent alien life. Isaac is not in his assigned seat on the panel, choosing instead to spend time reminiscing about Clara.\n\nA few months later, Rebecca summons Isaac to the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] laboratory. She reveals that the aliens have sent a message&mdash;\u201cIsaac Bruno\u201d. He is present when the next message arrives &ndash; an audio file of a [[Bob Dylan]] song that he and Clara often listened to together. The film ends with Isaac smiling through his tears.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick J.

The film stars husband and wife actors [[Patrick J. Adams]] and [[Troian Bellisario]], playing astrophysicist Isaac and itinerant artist Clara, who become close while searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe. The film is grounded in recent technological and theoretical advances, and attracted the attention of astronomers. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and out of a handful of nominations from various bodies, won an award from the [[Austin Film Festival]], \n\n==Plot==\nDr. Isaac Bruno holds a postdoctoral research fellowship in astrophysics at (fictional) Ontario University, in [[Toronto]]. His goal of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe has become an obsession, linked to an unspecified trauma in his personal life two years earlier. He has become increasingly antagonistic towards his students and has taken to misappropriating time on ground-based telescopes in Chile, intended for a colleague's research. His department head suspends him, denying him any access to the school's research facilities.\n\nThe [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] orbiting telescope is launched, providing enormous amounts of data that is shared with the world, in a community effort to analyze and find possible life on [[exoplanet]]s. Isaac posts flyers looking for an unpaid research assistant, offering nothing but room and board. His only response is from Clara, an uneducated artist who has lived a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian lifestyle]]. Clara has her own secrets, seen taking some type of medicine for an unspecified issue.\n\nIsaac focuses on results from [[Red dwarf|M dwarf]] stars, believing it to be a niche that no one else will bother with. When Clara finds a promising exoplanet, Isaac sneaks into the university in the night and lies to the telescope operators in Chile, claiming to have permission from his friend Charlie, to get more data on the planet.\n\nCharlie is furious, but also intrigued by the data results. He advises Isaac to contact Rebecca, Isaac's ex-wife, who holds an endowed chair at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Clara convinces Isaac to contact Rebecca, despite his reluctance. The upheaval in their lives is finally revealed, when Rebecca tells Isaac that finding life will not bring back their dead baby son. She gets him some time on the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] telescope. This results in proving that they have found a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet candidate]].\n\nClara is falling in love with Isaac, but he has become jaded about love or anything else that can not be scientifically proven. She kisses him, then abruptly backs off when he starts to respond. When Charlie's wife has a baby, Isaac pontificates on how a minuscule change took his own son, and could equally change the entire universe. Clara reminds him that those same minuscule changes did result in his son existing at all. This leads to them finally becoming a couple. \n\nWhen they learn that someone else discovered \u201ctheir\u201d planet a week before them, Isaac becomes despondent. He soon decides to focus on finding direct evidence of life, rather than just a potentially habitable planet. In his obsession, he is blind to Clara's declining health, until Charlie chastises him. Isaac tells Clara it is time for him to stop his search, but she makes him ignore the data and focus on his inner connection to the universe. He is surprised when it works, but rejects it and her. She grabs her bag to leave - and collapses.\n\nAt the hospital, it is revealed that Clara has an autoimmune disease that is causing the complete breakdown of every organ and muscle in her body. The doctors are shocked that she can even walk or talk, and confirm she will soon be dead. Isaac stays at her bedside for her last few days. Moments before she dies, she tells him he is going to \u201csee it\u201d.\n\nA fresh batch of TESS data is released, and Isaac does \u201csee it\u201d - proof of a seemingly artificial object in coincident orbit with an exoplanet. He takes his findings to Charlie, who introduces him to Dr. Rickman, head of the TESS project. Two years later, at a press conference at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], Dr. Rickman, Rebecca and Charlie explain that the data gathered now conclusively proves the existence of the artificial object, orbiting a star 200 light years distant, in turn proving the existence of intelligent alien life. Isaac is not in his assigned seat on the panel, choosing instead to spend time reminiscing about Clara.\n\nA few months later, Rebecca summons Isaac to the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] laboratory. She reveals that the aliens have sent a message&mdash;\u201cIsaac Bruno\u201d. He is present when the next message arrives &ndash; an audio file of a [[Bob Dylan]] song that he and Clara often listened to together. The film ends with Isaac smiling through his tears.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick J.
