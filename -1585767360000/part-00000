Inspired by Gaga's \"Fear of Self Monster\", the song deals with the intimate experience between two people alone in a bedroom. According to Gaga, the record is about a girl who prefers to have sex with the lights off because she is embarrassed about her body. She explained that she came across such women while working on the [[MAC AIDS Fund]], and that the song is not about freedom, but rather the assurance that Gaga understood their feelings. The song was released as a radio-only single in Australia and France.\n\n\"Dance in the Dark\" contains [[Retro style|retro]] and [[new wave music]] influences, and begins with a stuttering introduction. It includes a spoken interlude, where Gaga says the names of famous people whose lives ended tragically. The song has received critical acclaim from [[music critics]]. It charted on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Bubbling Under Hot 100]] chart, while reaching the top-thirty in Australia and the top-ten in Slovakia, Hungary and Czech Republic.\n\nGaga performed \"Dance in the Dark\" as the opening song of [[The Monster Ball Tour]]. In the first leg of the tour, she appeared behind a [[scrim (lighting)|scrim-lit]] screen to perform the song, while in the revamped shows, Gaga performs it on a set reminiscent of a [[New York City]] night scene.

Inspired by Gaga's \"Fear of Self Monster\", the song deals with the intimate experience between two people alone in a bedroom. According to Gaga, the record is about a girl who prefers to have sex with the lights off because she is embarrassed about her body. She explained that she came across such women while working on the [[MAC AIDS Fund]], and that the song is not about freedom, but rather the assurance that Gaga understood their feelings. The song was released as a radio-only single in Australia and France.\n\n\"Dance in the Dark\" contains [[Retro style|retro]] and [[new wave music]] influences, and begins with a stuttering introduction. It includes a spoken interlude, where Gaga says the names of famous people whose lives ended tragically. The song has received critical acclaim from [[music critics]]. It charted on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Bubbling Under Hot 100]] chart, while reaching the top-thirty in Australia and the top-ten in Slovakia, Hungary and Czech Republic.\n\nGaga performed \"Dance in the Dark\" as the opening song of [[The Monster Ball Tour]]. In the first leg of the tour, she appeared behind a [[scrim (lighting)|scrim-lit]] screen to perform the song, while in the revamped shows, Gaga performs it on a set reminiscent of a [[New York City]] night scene. The song was also performed at the [[2010 BRIT Awards]], where Gaga dedicated it to her close friend, [[Alexander McQueen]], who had committed suicide a few days earlier. The song is also performed at the singer's Las Vegas residency, [[Lady Gaga Enigma]]. It was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]] at the [[53rd Annual Grammy Awards]], but lost to [[Rihanna]]'s \"[[Only Girl (In the World)]]\".<ref name=Grammy2011>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/la-et-env-grammys-nominees-2010-list-htmlstory.html|title=Grammy Awards 2011: Winners and nominees for 53rd Grammy Awards|first=Allen J.|last=Schaben|accessdate=December 10, 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513020610/http://www.latimes.com/la-et-env-grammys-nominees-2010-list-htmlstory.html|archivedate=May 13, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Writing and inspiration==\nAccording to MTV, \"Dance in the Dark\" was initially planned to be released after \"[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]\", but due to a dispute between Gaga and her record company, \"[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]\" was released instead.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/lady-gaga/news/202724-lady-gaga-elton-john|title=Lady GaGa Will Release Alejandro As Next Single|last=Reporter|first=MTV|date=April 6, 2010|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=May 5, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414115105/http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/lady-gaga/news/202724-lady-gaga-elton-john|archivedate=April 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The song was released to Belgian [[iTunes]] on November 9, 2009 as a promotional single of an EP, and as a single was sent to Australia radio on July 26, 2010.<ref name=\"Itunes\">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/be/album/dance-in-the-dark-single/id338738402|title=Lady Gaga&nbsp;\u2013 \"Dance in the Dark\"&nbsp;\u2013 Belgium iTunes|accessdate=July 8, 2010|publisher=iTunes Store|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202143829/http://itunes.apple.com/be/album/dance-in-the-dark-single/id338738402|archivedate=December 2, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"ausradio\"/> Gaga told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that the inspiration behind \"Dance in the Dark\" as being the intimate experience taking place between two people alone in a bedroom, the fear of Sex Monster.

The estate was held by the prebendaries until it was vested in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in 1840 under the Act of that year. In 1649 the parliamentary commissioners sold it to Ralph Marsh but it reverted at the Restoration (1660). The leasehold interest of Brondesbury was bought with what remained too of Bounds manor in 1856 and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners retained the freehold until the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name=manorandhouse/>\n\nForty-year leases were made of Brondesbury to William Peter, gentleman of London, in 1538 and to Thomas Young, a Willesden yeoman, in reversion in 1566. In the first decade of the 17th century Young's widow and his daughter lived here. In 1615 the latter, Christian's estranged husband, Henry Shugborow, brought an action for possession against the executors, who had re-entered because the rent had not been paid and it had been sublet to one Marsh, 'an ancient tenant'. The estate was leased for lives in 1638 to Edward Roberts but Ralph Marsh, who in 1649 bought Brondesbury from the parliamentary commissioners, seems to have occupied the land. Thomas and Ralph Marsh were described as \"of Brands\" in 1679 and 1694 respectively. Ralph Marsh (d. 1709) in 1708 received a lease for lives. The estate was heavily mortgaged by the Marshes from 1725 and in 1749 Ralph Marsh sold the lease to John Stace, who obtained a new lease in 1757. Stace sold the lease in 1765 to Joseph Gibson, the undertenant, who obtained a new lease in 1769 and whose widow and son tried to sell the estate in 1778.  In 1788 Lady (Sarah) Salusbury purchased the leasehold, and in 1799 she obtained a new lease for lives. Brondesbury thereafter passed through the same ownership as Bounds, Lady Salusbury obtaining possession (all other competing leases rendered inferior) in 1842.<ref name=manorandhouse/>\n\nA moated house as the manor house existed by 1538. It was described in 1649, probably with the remnants of the moat, and was depicted in 1749 as a large, apparently L-shaped building with a central cupola. It appears to have been rebuilt in the third quarter of the 18th century and by the time of Lady (Sarah) Salusbury was a three-storeyed villa with a central canted entrance bay rising the full height of the north front. A lower wing, presumably an addition, ran southward from the east end. In 1789 [[Humphry Repton]] landscaped roughly {{convert|10|acre|adj=on}} of [[demesne]] grounds and William Wilkins supplied drawings for a Gothic seat. In his 'Red Book' Repton commented favourably on the hilltop site and enhanced the view towards London. The house and 23 acres, increased by 1834 to 53 acres, was occupied by [[Trotter baronets|Sir Coutts Trotter, Bt.]] (1804-36), Lady Trotter (1836-40), Lady (Elizabeth) Salusbury (1840-3), and Charles Hambro (1843-9). The house was extended westward and a semicircular bay was added to the south front in the early 19th century. By 1849 the demesne fell to 27 acres and the house, described in 1816 as being commodious yet having 'no regularity of architectural character' and in 1822 as an 'elegant seat', three-storeyed. It continued as a gentleman's residence under Mrs. Howard (1850-3), Henry Vallence (1853-6), Mrs. Geach (1856-61), John Coverdale (1862-7), and Thomas Brandon (1867-76), and in 1877 was offered for sale with 52 acres. After remaining empty it was leased as a school, to Margaret Clark (1882-98) and Lucy Soulsby (1898-1915). In 1891 the school added a classroom and dormitory block on the east and later a chapel beyond that. The house continued as a school until 1934 when, described as 'shabby-looking', it was bought by C. W. B. Simmonds, a builder, and was pulled down to make way for Manor Drive.<ref name=manorandhouse>Diane K Bolton, Patricia E C Croot and M A Hicks, 'Willesden: Manors', in ''A History of the County of Middlesex'': Volume 7 ed.

In AD 862 [[Ethelbert of Wessex|Ethelbert]], the King of Kent, granted land to form the Manor of Bromley. It was held by the [[Bishops of Rochester]] until 1845, when Coles Child, a wealthy local merchant and [[philanthropist]], purchased [[Bromley Palace]] (now the hub of the Bromley Civic Centre) and became lord of the manor.

It was a quiet rural village until the arrival of the railway in 1858 in [[Shortlands]], which led to rapid growth, and outlying suburban districts such as [[Bickley]] (which later overflowed into [[Bromley Common]]) were developed to accommodate those wishing to live so conveniently close to [[London]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.britishlocalhistory.co.uk/Default.aspx?tabid=8770&ProductID=6225 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409001009/http://www.britishlocalhistory.co.uk/Default.aspx?tabid=8770&ProductID=6225 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2009-04-09 | title=Bromley | publisher=Mick Scott, Non such Publishing | year=2005 }}</ref>\n\nBromley, also known as ''Bromley St Peter and St Paul'', formed an ancient parish in the [[Bromley and Beckenham (hundred)|Bromley and Beckenham]] hundred and the [[Sutton-at-Hone]] lathe of Kent.<ref name=vision_parish>{{cite vob | url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10103204 | name=Bromley parish | accessdate=29 September 2009 }}</ref> In 1840 it became part of the expanded [[Metropolitan Police District]].

In June 1991, PIA took delivery of its first of six [[Airbus A310|Airbus A310-300]] aircraft - with the new aircraft, the airline introduced flights to [[Tashkent]] in 1992 and to Z\u00fcrich in 1993.\n\nIn March 1993, AVM Farooq Umar became managing director of the airline. An [[Open Skies]] agreement between Karachi to Dubai was agreed upon in 1993, and 12 private airlines were allowed to operate domestically in Pakistan. Both steps came simultaneously and put great pressure on PIA's financial performance, though PIA launched six new routes to the Persian Gulf and CIS countries, along with a tourist 'Air Safari' scenic flight over the [[Karakoram Mountains]] in 1994. Non-stop flights from Lahore and Islamabad to JFK and Canada were launched, while PIA added Jakarta, [[Fujairah]], [[Baku]] and [[Al-Ain]] to its network in 1994. In addition, PIA became a client of three flight-reservation systems, namely: [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], [[Galileo CRS|Galileo]] and [[Amadeus CRS|Amadeus]].\n\nA [[Tupolev Tu-154]] aircraft was also leased briefly in 1996 to cope with a surge in passenger traffic during summer 1996. Flights to Beirut were resumed the same year as well before being discontinued a few years later. In 1999, PIA leased five Boeing 747-300 aircraft from [[Cathay Pacific]] to replace its Boeing 747-200M fleet. The aircraft were painted with a new livery, a handwork Pashmina tail, on white body and large Pakistan titles on the front fuselage. The livery was adopted in the early 90s but due to some copyright issues, it was dropped. The Boeing 747-300s continued to bear the new livery, but with a plain green tail with PIA titles. The other aircraft in the fleet were repainted in early 1990s livery.\n\n==== 2000s ====\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Boeing 747-367, Pakistan International Airlines - PIA AN0367768.jpg\n| caption1 = PIA [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]] on short final to [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow International Airport]], circa 2003.\n| image2 = Boeing 777-240(ER), Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) JP5656886.jpg\n| caption2 = PIA [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] taking off from [[Manchester Airport]], circa 2006.\n| width = \n}}\n\nThe [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] following the attacks on [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]] negatively impacted PIA's operations as Afghan airspace was closed.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, following restructuring of the airline under new management in April 2001, the airline again became profitable.<ref name=\":10\" /> Cost per employee dropped 24% between 2000-3, which lower engineering and maintenance costs lead to enhanced airline revenue.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn July 2002, PIA purchased six [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]] aircraft from [[Cathay Pacific]], five of which were already on lease. The sixth one arrived shortly afterwards and was used mainly on its North American and European routes. In October 2002, after ten years without any new orders, the airline placed an order for eight [[Boeing 777]] aircraft. The order included all three variants of 777, i.e. three 777-200ER (Extended Range), two 777-200LR (Longer Range) and three 777-300ER versions. PIA was the launch customer that revived the Boeing 777-200LR project that, until then, only had three orders.\n\nBoeing delivered the first of three 777-200ER aircraft to PIA in January 2004, and PIA introduced a new livery for the 777-200ERs that was applied to most of its fleet. PIA also leased six more Airbus A310-300 aircraft directly from Airbus. On 3 November 2005, PIA placed an order to purchase seven [[ATR 42]]-500 aircraft to replace its ageing fleet of Fokker F27 Friendships. On 10 November 2005, PIA used the 777-200LR to fly the world's longest flight by a commercial airliner, flying over 21,000 kilometers on an eastbound flight from Hong Kong to London for 22 hours and 22 minutes<ref name=\":19\" /> - a record which still stands as of late 2019.<ref name=\":20\" /> On 6 December 2005, PIA acquired another new Boeing 777-200ER on a ten-year lease.  On 23 December 2006, PIA took delivery of its first [[Boeing 777]]-300ER. The remaining aircraft were delivered in January 2007.\n\nOn 25 February 2006, Boeing delivered its first 777-200LR to PIA. ATR delivered two of the seven ordered ATR 42s to PIA in May and December 2006 respectively, following which the airline ceased using military [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] for passenger services in northern areas of Pakistan. The military aircraft were being used after the [[PIA Flight 688]] accident.\n\nWith the induction of long-range 777 aircraft in its fleet, PIA started offering non-stop flights from [[Toronto]] to Karachi, Islamabad, and Lahore from 3 March 2006. PIA had also planned non-stop flights to New York City, Chicago, [[Washington D.C.|Washington]], and [[Houston]] but was not permitted by US authorities (unless the airline implemented a European stopover on the flight to American cities) due to security concerns after 9/11.\n\nA PIA flight from Multan crashed in July 2006, killing 45. A government inquiry afterwards blamed aging aircraft for the crash.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-10792774|title=Pakistan crash raises questions about air safety|last=Hasan|first=Syed Shoaib|date=28 July 2010|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> Houston services also ended in 2006.

The livery was white at the front and beige at the rear separated by a dark green stripe. The tail was painted white with a new typeface PIA acronym written in dark green. The Pakistan title was added to the front fuselage in all raised letters and the engine cowlings were painted in beige. The PIA logo written in calligraphic Urdu was added just behind the cockpit. However, due to criticism, the design was modified before the first Boeing 777 was delivered. The tail logo was replaced by a flowing Pakistan flag on a beige background. The \"Pakistan\" titles were removed and the PIA acronym was enlarged and moved onto the fuselage. The English and Urdu PIA titles remained the same. The leased A310s and most of the PIA fleet also adopted this livery at a later date.\n\n[[File:Boeing 747-300 (PIA) (5299437361).jpg|thumb|A PIA Boeing 747-300 painted in a ''Frontier'' livery]]\nIn early 2006, the airline launched four new tail designs for its fleet. The tails represented the four provinces of Pakistan: [[Sindh]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. The tails promoted the cultures of the four provinces of Pakistan by applying motifs to the tails and adding a city name to the rear of the fuselage corresponding to the province. The \"Frontier\" tail represented the \"Phulkari\" (flowering) pattern, which reflected a tradition of embroidery generally done on shawls, shirts, and linen. The \"Punjab\" tail was loosely related to the tile decoration of the [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in Lahore. The \"Balochistan\" tail showed the creativity seen in the local kilims, carpets, and rugs woven with wool, goat or camel hair and mixed yarn. The pattern was mostly bold geometric motifs in primary colours dominated by red. The \"Sindh\" tail was influenced by the Hala tile work with electric blue and white floral patterns. In 2009, management stopped the application of provincial tails, deeming them too costly.\n\nPIA launched its new livery in early April 2010. An Airbus A310, Boeing 777-200 and Boeing 747-300 were the first aircraft to wear the new look. The livery was unveiled at the PIA headquarters on a Boeing 777 model. The livery consisted of a green and gold strip running around the bottom of the fuselage and continuing right up until the tail cone. The forward/upper portion was white and at the rear, it was an off-white/beige colour. The bottom part of the tail blended into the upper fuselage as it too is white, with the rest of the tail painted with a large wavy Pakistan flag, which takes up the whole tail, in a dark green colour. At the front of the fuselage, 'PIA' was written in a billboard style in dark green and underneath 'Pakistan' was written in golden colour. Just behind the cockpit, there is a stylised Urdu PIA logo as well as on the engines.\n\nIn July 2014, on the delivery of the first A320 series aircraft, PIA introduced a \"crescent and star\" on the aircraft engines' cowlings in place of the Urdu PIA logo. In 2015, after the completion of sixty years service, the 1960s livery was applied to three of the Airbus A320s and on one Boeing 777-200ER.\n\n[[File:PIA Markhor Livery.png|thumb|In 2018, Pakistan's national animal Markhor was chosen to be introduced as the brand identity on aircraft tail, however later the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] took ''suo motu'' action and barred PIA from using the Markhor as brand identity, only one Airbus A320 was painted in the livery.]]\nIn April 2018, PIA formally launched a new brand identity and livery and added a portrait of the [[Markhor]] in a ceremony held at PIA Offices in Islamabad, presented by the then head of brand of PIA, having Pakistan's national animal represented on its aircraft, including a large one on the tail and two on the engines, describing the resilient nature of PIA Brand surviving under the onslaught of all the negativity associated with the brand. The symbol of animal was chosen for its universal recognition as the Urdu calligraphy logo of PIA could not be comprehended by non-Pakistani customers. In essence the idea was to make PIA a truly international brand based on the values of resilience, grace and fortitude, something which PIA had lost with increased focus on ethnic traffic. The tail had a forward leaping Markhor having long screw horns, which are the features of 'Kashmiri Markhor' endemic to Pakistan only. According to the initial plan, a euro-white style was chosen and existing green and golden strips were removed from the aircraft fuselage along with off-white/beige colour on the rear fuselage, but later a major rebranding was carried out. The font of the PIA logo was also changed and added to the fuselage. For the first time, legacy PIA colours (Pakistan green and mustard gold) were dropped and a blue texture was added in the \"PIA\" acronym expanding the colour palette for the brand. [[Urdu]] PIA logo colour was also changed from the yellow-green gradient texture. The airline's slogan was also changed to \"''We Fly at the Right Attitude''\" from \"Great People to Fly With\". The first aircraft with the redesigned livery was converted on 12 May 2018 and rolled out of Isphani Hanger by the method of decals to make a debut at the [[Islamabad International Airport|New Islamabad International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1399780|title=First plane to land at new Islamabad airport tomorrow|last=Asghar|first=Mohammad|date=6 April 2018|work=Dawn}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Asghar|first1=Mohammad|title=PIA planes get a facelift|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1400035|work=Dawn|date=7 April 2018}}</ref> The re-branding was halted on Suo Moto Notice taken by Supreme Court of Pakistan on fears of spending millions on the rebranding and not paying the salary of the staff on time. The [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] ''suo motu'' notice barred PIA from using the Markhor logo as its brand identity. Supreme Court later gave orders to retain the flag on the tail and disposed off the case.

In the following years, [[PIA Planetarium, Karachi|PIA Planetarium]] was inaugurated in Karachi which was followed by planetariums in [[PIA Planetarium, Lahore|Lahore]] and [[PIA Planetarium, Peshawar|Peshawar]].

In June 1991, PIA took delivery of its first of six [[Airbus A310|Airbus A310-300]] aircraft - with the new aircraft, the airline introduced flights to [[Tashkent]] in 1992 and to Z\u00fcrich in 1993.\n\nIn March 1993, AVM Farooq Umar became managing director of the airline. An [[Open Skies]] agreement between Karachi to Dubai was agreed upon in 1993, and 12 private airlines were allowed to operate domestically in Pakistan. Both steps came simultaneously and put great pressure on PIA's financial performance, though PIA launched six new routes to the Persian Gulf and CIS countries, along with a tourist 'Air Safari' scenic flight over the [[Karakoram Mountains]] in 1994. Non-stop flights from Lahore and Islamabad to JFK and Canada were launched, while PIA added Jakarta, [[Fujairah]], [[Baku]] and [[Al-Ain]] to its network in 1994. In addition, PIA became a client of three flight-reservation systems, namely: [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], [[Galileo CRS|Galileo]] and [[Amadeus CRS|Amadeus]].\n\nA [[Tupolev Tu-154]] aircraft was also leased briefly in 1996 to cope with a surge in passenger traffic during summer 1996. Flights to Beirut were resumed the same year as well before being discontinued a few years later. In 1999, PIA leased five Boeing 747-300 aircraft from [[Cathay Pacific]] to replace its Boeing 747-200M fleet. The aircraft were painted with a new livery, a handwork Pashmina tail, on white body and large Pakistan titles on the front fuselage. The livery was adopted in the early 90s but due to some copyright issues, it was dropped. The Boeing 747-300s continued to bear the new livery, but with a plain green tail with PIA titles. The other aircraft in the fleet were repainted in early 1990s livery.\n\n==== 2000s ====\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Boeing 747-367, Pakistan International Airlines - PIA AN0367768.jpg\n| caption1 = PIA [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]] on short final to [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow International Airport]], circa 2003.\n| image2 = Boeing 777-240(ER), Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) JP5656886.jpg\n| caption2 = PIA [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] taking off from [[Manchester Airport]], circa 2006.\n| width = \n}}\n\nThe [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] following the attacks on [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]] negatively impacted PIA's operations as Afghan airspace was closed.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, following restructuring of the airline under new management in April 2001, the airline again became profitable.<ref name=\":10\" /> Cost per employee dropped 24% between 2000-3, which lower engineering and maintenance costs lead to enhanced airline revenue.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn July 2002, PIA purchased six [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]] aircraft from [[Cathay Pacific]], five of which were already on lease. The sixth one arrived shortly afterwards and was used mainly on its North American and European routes. In October 2002, after ten years without any new orders, the airline placed an order for eight [[Boeing 777]] aircraft. The order included all three variants of 777, i.e. three 777-200ER (Extended Range), two 777-200LR (Longer Range) and three 777-300ER versions. PIA was the launch customer that revived the Boeing 777-200LR project that, until then, only had three orders.\n\nBoeing delivered the first of three 777-200ER aircraft to PIA in January 2004, and PIA introduced a new livery for the 777-200ERs that was applied to most of its fleet. PIA also leased six more Airbus A310-300 aircraft directly from Airbus. On 3 November 2005, PIA placed an order to purchase seven [[ATR 42]]-500 aircraft to replace its ageing fleet of Fokker F27 Friendships. On 10 November 2005, PIA used the 777-200LR to fly the world's longest flight by a commercial airliner, flying over 21,000 kilometers on an eastbound flight from Hong Kong to London for 22 hours and 22 minutes<ref name=\":19\" /> - a record which still stands as of late 2019.<ref name=\":20\" /> On 6 December 2005, PIA acquired another new Boeing 777-200ER on a ten-year lease.  On 23 December 2006, PIA took delivery of its first [[Boeing 777]]-300ER. The remaining aircraft were delivered in January 2007.\n\nOn 25 February 2006, Boeing delivered its first 777-200LR to PIA. ATR delivered two of the seven ordered ATR 42s to PIA in May and December 2006 respectively, following which the airline ceased using military [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] for passenger services in northern areas of Pakistan. The military aircraft were being used after the [[PIA Flight 688]] accident.\n\nWith the induction of long-range 777 aircraft in its fleet, PIA started offering non-stop flights from [[Toronto]] to Karachi, Islamabad, and Lahore from 3 March 2006. PIA had also planned non-stop flights to New York City, Chicago, [[Washington D.C.|Washington]], and [[Houston]] but was not permitted by US authorities (unless the airline implemented a European stopover on the flight to American cities) due to security concerns after 9/11.\n\nA PIA flight from Multan crashed in July 2006, killing 45.

The government announced its privatisation plans but they were never implemented. Several steps towards outsourcing of non-core business have been initiated. Catering units (starting with Karachi Flight Kitchen), ground handling (starting with ramp services) and engineering, are to be gradually carved out of the airline and operated as independent companies. During 1997, Pakistan called in a team from [[International Finance]] (IFC), the consulting arm of the [[World Bank]], to advise on restructuring and privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).

The \"Pakistan\" titles were removed and the PIA acronym was enlarged and moved onto the fuselage. The English and Urdu PIA titles remained the same. The leased A310s and most of the PIA fleet also adopted this livery at a later date.\n\n[[File:Boeing 747-300 (PIA) (5299437361).jpg|thumb|A PIA Boeing 747-300 painted in a ''Frontier'' livery]]\nIn early 2006, the airline launched four new tail designs for its fleet. The tails represented the four provinces of Pakistan: [[Sindh]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. The tails promoted the cultures of the four provinces of Pakistan by applying motifs to the tails and adding a city name to the rear of the fuselage corresponding to the province. The \"Frontier\" tail represented the \"Phulkari\" (flowering) pattern, which reflected a tradition of embroidery generally done on shawls, shirts, and linen. The \"Punjab\" tail was loosely related to the tile decoration of the [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in Lahore. The \"Balochistan\" tail showed the creativity seen in the local kilims, carpets, and rugs woven with wool, goat or camel hair and mixed yarn. The pattern was mostly bold geometric motifs in primary colours dominated by red. The \"Sindh\" tail was influenced by the Hala tile work with electric blue and white floral patterns. In 2009, management stopped the application of provincial tails, deeming them too costly.\n\nPIA launched its new livery in early April 2010. An Airbus A310, Boeing 777-200 and Boeing 747-300 were the first aircraft to wear the new look. The livery was unveiled at the PIA headquarters on a Boeing 777 model. The livery consisted of a green and gold strip running around the bottom of the fuselage and continuing right up until the tail cone. The forward/upper portion was white and at the rear, it was an off-white/beige colour. The bottom part of the tail blended into the upper fuselage as it too is white, with the rest of the tail painted with a large wavy Pakistan flag, which takes up the whole tail, in a dark green colour. At the front of the fuselage, 'PIA' was written in a billboard style in dark green and underneath 'Pakistan' was written in golden colour. Just behind the cockpit, there is a stylised Urdu PIA logo as well as on the engines.\n\nIn July 2014, on the delivery of the first A320 series aircraft, PIA introduced a \"crescent and star\" on the aircraft engines' cowlings in place of the Urdu PIA logo. In 2015, after the completion of sixty years service, the 1960s livery was applied to three of the Airbus A320s and on one Boeing 777-200ER.\n\n[[File:PIA Markhor Livery.png|thumb|In 2018, Pakistan's national animal Markhor was chosen to be introduced as the brand identity on aircraft tail, however later the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] took ''suo motu'' action and barred PIA from using the Markhor as brand identity, only one Airbus A320 was painted in the livery.]]\nIn April 2018, PIA formally launched a new brand identity and livery and added a portrait of the [[Markhor]] in a ceremony held at PIA Offices in Islamabad, presented by the then head of brand of PIA, having Pakistan's national animal represented on its aircraft, including a large one on the tail and two on the engines, describing the resilient nature of PIA Brand surviving under the onslaught of all the negativity associated with the brand. The symbol of animal was chosen for its universal recognition as the Urdu calligraphy logo of PIA could not be comprehended by non-Pakistani customers. In essence the idea was to make PIA a truly international brand based on the values of resilience, grace and fortitude, something which PIA had lost with increased focus on ethnic traffic. The tail had a forward leaping Markhor having long screw horns, which are the features of 'Kashmiri Markhor' endemic to Pakistan only. According to the initial plan, a euro-white style was chosen and existing green and golden strips were removed from the aircraft fuselage along with off-white/beige colour on the rear fuselage, but later a major rebranding was carried out. The font of the PIA logo was also changed and added to the fuselage. For the first time, legacy PIA colours (Pakistan green and mustard gold) were dropped and a blue texture was added in the \"PIA\" acronym expanding the colour palette for the brand. [[Urdu]] PIA logo colour was also changed from the yellow-green gradient texture. The airline's slogan was also changed to \"''We Fly at the Right Attitude''\" from \"Great People to Fly With\". The first aircraft with the redesigned livery was converted on 12 May 2018 and rolled out of Isphani Hanger by the method of decals to make a debut at the [[Islamabad International Airport|New Islamabad International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1399780|title=First plane to land at new Islamabad airport tomorrow|last=Asghar|first=Mohammad|date=6 April 2018|work=Dawn}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Asghar|first1=Mohammad|title=PIA planes get a facelift|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1400035|work=Dawn|date=7 April 2018}}</ref> The re-branding was halted on Suo Moto Notice taken by Supreme Court of Pakistan on fears of spending millions on the rebranding and not paying the salary of the staff on time. The [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] ''suo motu'' notice barred PIA from using the Markhor logo as its brand identity. Supreme Court later gave orders to retain the flag on the tail and disposed off the case. However, with management change, the re-branding was abandoned altogether.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ch-aviation.com/portal/news/67193-pia-secures-limited-govt-funding-but-barred-from-rebranding|title=PIA secures limited gov't funding but barred from rebranding}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/258919/pia-rebranding-aims-to-rectify-errors-build-global-image/|title=PIA rebranding aims to rectify errors, build global image \u2013 Daily Times|date=27 June 2018}}</ref> Currently, the airline is operating a hybrid livery which features a euro-white fuselage and gold Urdu logo in-front of the front exits and engine cowling while the flag tail, English PIA (and Pakistan International in gold) titles in dark green and Pakistan titles in dark green on the belly have been retained from the 2010 livery. The PIA corporate website was also added ahead of the aft exits. Currently, five Boeing 777s and three A320s are sporting this livery.\n\n=== Former fleet ===\n[[File:PIA Douglas DC-8 Gilliand.jpg|thumb|A PIA [[Douglas DC-8|Douglas DC-8-21]], leased in 1977-1978]]\n[[File:Airbus_A310-308,_Pakistan_International_Airlines_-_PIA_AN0562544.jpg|thumb|A PIA [[Airbus A310-300]] landed at [[Germany]], [[Frankfurt Airport]] on 25 April 2004.]]\n[[File:Airbus A321-231, Pakistan International Airlines - PIA (Inter Airlines) AN1157696.jpg|thumb|A PIA [[Airbus A321]] taking off from [[Islamabad Airport]] (2006)]]\n[[File:PIA Boeing 747-300 Asuspine-5.jpg|thumb|A PIA [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]] taking off from the [[Multan International Airport]] for a [[Hajj]] flight on 28 October 2010.]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;text-align:center; margin: 1em auto;\"\n|+ \n|-\n!style=\"background:#004F30; width:150px;\"  |<span style=\"color:#AB9214;\">Aircraft</span>\n!style=\"background:#004F30; width:150px;\"  |<span style=\"color:#AB9214;\">Total</span>\n!style=\"background:#004F30; width:150px;\"  |<span style=\"color:#AB9214;\">Introduced</span>\n!style=\"background:#004F30; width:150px;\"  |<span style=\"color:#AB9214;\">Retired</span>\n|-\n|[[Airbus A300B4-200]]\n|11\n|1980\n|2005\n|-\n|[[Airbus A310-300]]\n|12\n|1991\n|2016\n|-\n|[[Airbus A321-200]]\n|2\n|2006\n|2007\n|-\n|[[Airbus A330-300]]\n|3\n|2016\n|2017<ref name=\"SriLank\" />\n|-\n|[[Boeing 707-320C]]\n|13\n|1960\n|1998\n|-\n|[[Boeing 720B]]\n|9\n|1962\n|1986\n|-\n|[[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]\n|8\n|1985\n|2014\n|-\n|[[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-400]]\n|2\n|2004\n|2005\n|-\n|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]]\n|4\n|2014\n|2015\n|-\n|[[Boeing 747-200B]]\n|6\n|1976\n|2005\n|-\n|[[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-200B Combi]]\n|2\n|1979\n|2011\n|-\n|[[Boeing 747-300]]\n|6\n|1999\n|2015\n|-\n|[[Convair CV-240 family|Convair CV-240]]\n|4\n|1955\n|1959\n|-\n|[[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]]\n|8\n|1970\n|2001\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-3]]\n|15\n|1955\n|1967\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-8|Douglas DC-8-21F]]\n|1\n|1977\n|1978\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-8|Douglas DC-61CF]]\n|1\n|1977\n|1978\n|-\n|[[Fokker F27 Friendship|Fokker F27-200 Friendship]]\n|24\n|1961\n|2006\n|-\n|[[Fokker F27 Friendship|Fokker F27-400 Friendship]]\n|1\n|1961\n|2003\n|-\n|[[Fokker F27 Friendship|Fokker F27-600 Friendship]]\n|5\n|1966\n|1986\n|-\n|[[Hiller OH-23 Raven|Hiller UH-12E4]]\n|1\n|1963\n|1971\n|-\n|[[Hawker Siddeley Trident|Hawker Siddeley Trident 1E]]\n|4\n|1966\n|1970\n|-\n|[[Lockheed L-100 Hercules|Lockheed L-100-382B-4C Hercules]]\n|2\n|1966\n|1966\n|-\n|[[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation|Lockheed L-1049C Super Constellation]]\n|3\n|1954\n|1969\n|-\n|[[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation|Lockheed L-1049H Super Constellation]]\n|2\n|1958\n|1969\n|-\n|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30]]\n|5\n|1974\n|1986\n|-\n|[[Mil Mi-8|Mil Mi-8 MTV-1]]\n|1\n|1995\n|1997\n|-\n|[[Sikorsky S-61|Sikorsky S-61N]]\n|4\n|1963\n|1967\n|- \n|[[Tupolev Tu-154]]\n|4\n|1996\n|1997\n|-\n|[[Vickers Viscount|Vickers Viscount 815]]\n|5\n|1956\n|1966\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Services ==\n=== Cabin ===\nPIA operates a three-class configuration on its domestic routes: [[Business class|Business]], [[Premium Economy|Executive Economy]] and [[Economy class|Economy]].
