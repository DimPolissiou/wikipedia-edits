The length of a keychain allows an item to be used more easily than if connected directly to a keyring. Some keychains allow one or both ends the ability to rotate, keeping the keychain from becoming twisted, while the item is being used.\n\nA keychain can also be a connecting link between a keyring and the [[belt (clothing)|belt]] of an individual. It is usually employed by personnel whose job demands frequent use of keys, such as a [[security guard]], prison officer, [[janitor]], or [[retail]] store manager. The chain is often retractable, and therefore may be a [[nylon]] rope, instead of an actual metal chain. The chain ensures that the keys remain attached to the individual using them, makes accidental loss less likely, and saves on wear and tear on the [[pocket]]s of the user.\n\n==Use of keychains==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\nKeychains are one of the most common souvenir and advertising items. Keychains are commonly used to promote businesses. A standard advertising keychain will carry the businesses name and contact information and often a logo.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, with the improvement of plastic manufacturing techniques, promotional items including keychains became unique. Businesses could place their names on promotional keychains that were three-dimensional for less cost than the standard metal keychains.\n\nKeychains are small and inexpensive enough to become promotional items for larger national companies that might give them out by the millions. For example, with the launch of a new movie or television show, those companies might partner with food companies to provide a character keychain in each box of cereal.\n\n[[File:Sandal keychain.jpg|thumb|left|A souvenir [[sandal]] keychain from the Philippines]]\nKeychains that currently hold keys are an item that is never long misplaced by the owner. People sometimes attach their keychain to their [[Belt (clothing)|belt]] (or belt loop) to avoid loss or to allow quick access to it. Many keychains also offer functions that the owner wants easily accessible as well. These include an army knife, bottle opener, an electronic organizer, scissors, address book, family photos, nail clipper, pill case and even pepper spray. Modern cars often include a keychain that serves as a remote to lock/unlock the car or even start the engine. An electronic key finder is also a useful item found on many keys that will beep when summoned for quick finding when misplace\n\n== Keyring ==\n[[File:AddingKeyToKeyring.png|thumb|A key can be added to a keyring by forcing an end of the loop open and sliding the key along the spiral.]]\nA keyring or \"[[circle cotter|split ring]]\" is a ring that holds [[Key (lock)|keys]] and other small items, which are sometimes connected to keychains. Other types of keyrings are made of leather, wood and rubber. Keyrings were invented in the 19th century by [[Samuel Harrison]].<ref>J.T.Bunce, Memoir of Sir Josiah Mason, p. 208; Simon Parkes, A Tale of Two Knives, Midland Ancestor, vol. 8, no. 4, June 1987. Henry Bore, The Story of the Invention of Steel Pens, 1890, at p. 20 says that Harrison made a steel pen for [[Joseph Priestley]] in about 1780, \"probably the first steel pen ever produced.\"</ref> The most common form of the keyring is a single piece of metal in a 'double loop'. Either end of the loop can be pried open to allow a key to be inserted and slid along the spiral until it becomes wholly engaged onto the ring. Novelty [[carabiner]]s are also commonly used as keyrings for ease of access and exchange. Often the keyring is adorned with a key fob for self-identification. Other forms of rings may use a single loop of metal or plastic with a mechanism to open and securely close the loop.\n\n== Key fob ==\n[[File:keyfob.JPG|thumb|A wooden key fob made in [[Finland]]]]\nA '''key fob''' is a generally decorative and at times useful item many people often carry with their [[Key (lock)|keys]], on a ring or a chain, for ease of tactile identification, to provide a better grip, or to make a personal statement. The word ''fob'' may be linked to the [[German dialects#Low German|low German dialect]] for the word ''Fuppe'', meaning \"pocket\"; however, the real origin of the word is uncertain. Fob pockets (meaning 'sneak proof' from the German word Foppen) were pockets meant to deter thieves. A short \"fob chain\" was used to attach to items, like a pocket watch, placed in these pockets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alphadictionary.com/goodword/word/fob |title=fob - alphaDictionary * Free English On-line Dictionary |publisher= Alphadictionary.com |date= |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nFobs vary considerably in size, style and functionality. Most commonly they are simple discs of smooth metal or plastic, typically with a message or symbol such as that of a [[logo]] (as with conference trinkets) or a sign of an important group affiliation. A fob may be symbolic or strictly aesthetic, but it can also be a small tool. Many fobs are small [[flashlight]]s, [[compasses]], [[calculators]], [[penknives]], [[discount card]]s, [[bottle openers]], [[security token]]s, and [[USB flash drives]]. As electronic technology continues to become smaller and cheaper, miniature key-fob versions of (previously) larger devices are becoming common, such as [[digital photo frame]]s, [[remote control]] units for [[garage door opener]]s, [[barcode scanner]]s and simple [[video game]]s (e.g. [[Tamagotchi]]) or other [[gadget]]s such as [[breathalyzer]]s.\n\nSome retail establishments such as gasoline stations keep their bathrooms locked and customers must ask for the key from the attendant. In such cases, the keychain has a very large fob to make it difficult for customers to walk off with the key.\n\n===Access control key fobs===\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2013}}\n[[File:RSA-SecurID-Tokens.jpg|thumb|[[Security token]]s from [[RSA Security]] designed as key fobs.]]\n[[Access control]] key fobs are [[Electronics|electronic]] key fobs that are used for controlling access to buildings or vehicles. They are used for activating such things as [[Keyless entry systems|remote keyless entry systems]] on [[motor vehicles]]. Early electric key fobs operated using [[infrared]] and required a clear [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] to function. These could be copied using a programmable [[remote control]]. More recent models use [[challenge-response authentication]] over [[radio frequency]], so these are harder to copy and do not need line-of-sight to operate. Programming these remotes sometimes requires the automotive dealership to connect a diagnostic tool, but many of them can be self-programmed by following a sequence of steps in the vehicle and usually requires at least one working key.\n\nKey fobs are used in [[apartment buildings]] and [[condominium]] buildings for controlling access to common areas (for example, lobby doors, storage areas, fitness room, pool). These usually contain a [[Radio-frequency identification|passive RFID]] tag. The fob operates in much the same manner as a [[proximity card]] to communicate (via a reader pad) with a central server for the building, which can be programmed to allow access only to those areas in which the tenant or owner is permitted to access, or only within certain time frames.\n\n[[Telecommuters]] may also use a [[security token]] \u2014 an electronic device often referred to as a fob \u2014 that provides one part of a three-way match to log in over an [[Computer security|unsecure]] [[computer network|network]] connection to a secure network. (A well-known example is the [[RSA SecurID]] token.) This kind of key fob may have a keypad on which the user must enter a [[Personal identification number|PIN]] to retrieve an access code, or it could be a display-only device.\n\nRFID key fobs can be easily cloned with tools like the Proxmark3, and there are several companies in America that offer this service.\n\n\n== Costs ==\n[[File:Schluesselan.jpg|thumb|A key with a simple text label keychain]]\nThe costs of keychains vary widely depending on their purpose. Advertising keychains begin at only a few cents a piece to a few dollars each. They are normally purchased in large quantities often over 500 at a time.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nKeychains are found in retail stores to represent things such as television shows, movies, video games, nostalgia, hobbies, interests and personalities. These keychains range from a dollar up to ten dollars and more.\n\nElectronic keychains including games and small organizers start at a few dollars and can be up to 50 US dollars. Other keychain electronics including cameras, digital photo frames and USB drives cost 10 to 100 USD.\n\nSouvenir keychains are one of the most popular keychains that sell. These are keychains that represent a trip or a location that a person is visiting. These most commonly cost 1 to 10 USD.\n\n== As a collectible item ==\nThe most popular focused keychain collections are advertising, souvenir, monument, popular characters and nostalgia-related items.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=W6YNBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=collectible+keychains+-+souvenir,+popular+characters,+nostalgia+items&source=bl&ots=XLnbmA_bUe&sig=OKEB98zMcyZrI8o9iDz5Zm7dzMA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IL5eVab0AcG3uAS9moG4Bw&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=collectible%20keychains%20-%20souvenir%2C%20popular%20characters%2C%20nostalgia%20items&f=false|title=Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): High-impact Strategies - What You Need to Know|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nCollectors display and store their keychains in several different ways.

{"title_page": "Multi-factor authentication", "text_new": "{{redirect|selfref=true|Two-factor authentication|two-factor authentication on Wikipedia|Help:Two-factor authentication}}\n{{short description|Method of computer access control}}\n{{Computer security}}\n'''Multi-factor authentication'''  is an [[authentication]] method in which a [[computer user]] is granted access only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an [[authentication]] mechanism: knowledge (something the user and only the user knows), possession (something the user and only the user has), and inherence (something the user and only the user is).<ref>{{cite web\n  |title = Two-factor authentication: What you need to know (FAQ) \u2013 CNET\n  |url = http://www.cnet.com/news/two-factor-authentication-what-you-need-to-know-faq\n  |website = CNET|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}</ref>\n\n'''Two-factor authentication''' (also known as '''2FA''') is a type, or subset, of multi-factor authentication. It is a method of confirming users' claimed identities by using a combination of ''two'' different factors: 1) something they know, 2) something they have, or 3) something they are.\n\nA good example of two-factor authentication is the withdrawing of money from an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]; only the correct combination of a [[bank card]] (something the user possesses) and a [[Personal identification number|PIN]] (something the user knows) allows the transaction to be carried out.\n\nTwo other examples are to supplement a user-controlled password with a [[one-time password]] (OTP) or code generated or received by an [[authenticator]]  (e.g. a security token or smartphone) that only the user possesses.\n\n'''Two-step verification''' or '''two-step authentication''' is a method of confirming a user's claimed identity by utilizing something they know (password) and a second factor {{em|other}} than something they have or something they are. An example of a second step is the user repeating back something that was sent to them through an [[out-of-band]] mechanism (such as a code sent over SMS), or a number generated by an [[Mobile app|app]] that is common to the user and the [[Authentication and Key Agreement|authentication system]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/41939/two-step-vs-two-factor-authentication-is-there-a-difference|title=Two-Step vs. Two-Factor Authentication - Is there a difference?|website=Information Security Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==Authentication factors==\nThe use of multiple authentication factors to prove one's identity is based on the premise that an unauthorized actor is unlikely to be able to supply the factors required for access. If, in an authentication attempt, at least one of the components is missing or supplied incorrectly, the user's identity is not established with sufficient certainty and access to the asset (e.g., a building, or data) being protected by multi-factor authentication then remains blocked. The authentication factors of a multi-factor authentication scheme may include:{{cn|date=November 2019}} \n*'''Something you have''' - some physical object in the possession of the user, such as a [[USB flash drive|USB stick]] with a secret token, a bank card, a key, a physical token, etc.<ref>https://gkaccess.com/products/halberd/ GateKeeper Password Manager with Tokens</ref>\n*'''Something you know''' - certain knowledge only known to the user, such as a password, PIN, [[Transaction authentication number|TAN]], etc.\n*'''Something you are''' - some physical characteristic of the user (biometrics), such as a fingerprint, eye iris, voice, typing speed, pattern in key press intervals, etc.\n*'''Somewhere you are''' - some connection to a specific computing network or utilizing a GPS signal to identify the location.<ref>{{Cite thesis|last=Seema|first=Sharma|title=Location Based Authentication|date=2005|publisher=University of New Orleans|url=https://scholarworks.uno.edu/td/141/|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Knowledge factors===\nKnowledge factors are the most commonly used form of authentication. In this form, the user is required to prove knowledge of a secret in order to authenticate.\n\nA [[password]] is a secret word or string of characters that is used for user authentication. This is the most commonly used mechanism of authentication. Many multi-factor authentication techniques rely on password as one factor of authentication. Variations include both longer ones formed from multiple words (a [[passphrase]]) and the shorter, purely numeric, [[personal identification number]] (PIN) commonly used for [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] access. Traditionally, passwords are expected to be [[memory|memorized]].\n\nMany [[secret question]]s such as \"Where were you born?\" are poor examples of a knowledge factor because they may be known to a wide group of people, or be able to be researched.\n\n===Possession factors===\nPossession factors (\"something the user and only the user has\") have been used for authentication for centuries, in the form of a key to a lock. The basic principle is that the key embodies a secret which is shared between the lock and the key, and the same principle underlies possession factor authentication in computer systems. A [[security token]] is an example of a possession factor.\n\n===={{Anchor|HARD-TOKEN}}Disconnected tokens====\n[[File:SecureID token new.JPG|thumbnail|[[RSA SecurID]] token, an example of a disconnected token generator]]\nDisconnected tokens have no connections to the client computer. They typically use a built-in screen to display the generated authentication data, which is manually typed in by the user.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2019/12/03/141-cybersecurity-predictions-for-2020/|title=141 Cybersecurity Predictions For 2020|last=Press|first=Gil|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>{{Better source|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Connected tokens====\nConnected tokens are [[machine|devices]] that are ''physically'' connected to the computer to be used. Those devices transmit data automatically.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title  = Encyclopedia of Cryptography and Security, Volume 1|last =|first =|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|year = 2011|isbn = 9781441959058|location =|page = 1305|editor-last =van Tilborg|editor-first = Henk C.A.|editor-last2 = Jajodia|editor-first2 = Sushil}}</ref> There are a number of different types, including card readers, [[RFID|wireless tags]] and USB tokens.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n====Software tokens====\nA [[software token]] (a.k.a. ''soft token'') is a type of [[two-factor authentication]] security device that may be used to authorize the use of computer services. Software tokens are stored on a general-purpose electronic device such as a [[desktop computer]], [[laptop]], [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]], or [[mobile phone]] and can be duplicated. (Contrast [[hardware token]]s, where the credentials are stored on a dedicated hardware device and therefore cannot be duplicated, absent physical invasion of the device.)  A soft token may not be a device the user interacts with.  Typically an X.509v3 certificate is loaded onto the device and stored securely to serve this purpose.\n\n===Inherent factors===\nThese are factors associated with the user, and are usually [[Biometrics|biometric]] methods, including [[fingerprint]], [[Face recognition|face]], [[Speaker recognition|voice]], or [[Iris recognition|iris]] recognition. Behavioral biometrics such as [[keystroke dynamics]] can also be used.\n\n===Location based factors===\nIncreasingly, a fourth factor is coming into play involving the physical location of the user.  While hard wired to the corporate network, a user could be allowed to login utilizing only a pin code while off the network entering a code from a soft token as well could be required.  This could be seen as an acceptable standard where access into the office is controlled.\n\nSystems for network admission control work in similar ways where your level of network access can be contingent on the specific network your device is connected to, such as wifi vs wired connectivity.  This also allows a user to move between offices and dynamically receive the same level of network access in each.\n\n==Use of mobile phones==\nMany multi-factor authentication vendors offer mobile phone-based authentication. Some methods include push-based authentication, QR code based authentication, one-time password authentication (event-based and time-based), and SMS-based verification. SMS-based verification suffers from some security concerns. Phones can be cloned, apps can run on several phones and cell-phone maintenance personnel can read SMS texts. Not least, cell phones can be compromised in general, meaning the phone is no longer something only the user has.\n\nThe major drawback of authentication including something the user possesses is that the user must carry around the physical token (the USB stick, the bank card, the key or similar), practically at all times. Loss and theft are risks. Many organizations forbid carrying USB and electronic devices in or out of premises owing to [[malware]] and data theft-risks, and most important machines do not have USB ports for the same reason. Physical tokens usually do not scale, typically requiring a new token for each new account and system. Procuring and subsequently replacing tokens of this kind involves costs. In addition, there are inherent conflicts and unavoidable trade-offs between usability and security.<ref>{{citation |url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/135.pdf |title=Anonymous Two-Factor Authentication in Distributed Systems: Certain Goals Are Beyond Attainment |access-date=2018-03-23}}</ref>\n\nTwo-step authentication involving mobile phones and smartphones provides an alternative to dedicated physical devices. To authenticate, people can use their personal access codes to the device (i.e. something that only the individual user knows) plus a one-time-valid, dynamic passcode, typically consisting of 4 to 6 digits. The passcode can be sent to their mobile device by [[SMS]] or can be generated by a one-time passcode-generator app. In both cases, the advantage of using a mobile phone is that there is no need for an additional dedicated token, as users tend to carry their mobile devices around at all times.\n\n{{As of | 2018}}, SMS is the most broadly-adopted multi-factor authentication method for consumer-facing accounts.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Notwithstanding the popularity of SMS verification, security advocates have publicly criticized it<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/06/hey-stop-using-texts-two-factor-authentication/ |title=So Hey You Should Stop Using Texts For Two-factor Authentication |author=Andy Greenberg |date=2016-06-26 |access-date=2018-05-12 |journal=Wired}}</ref> and in July 2016 a United States [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] draft guideline proposed deprecating it as a form of authentication.<ref>{{cite blog|title= NIST is No Longer Recommending Two-Factor Authentication Using SMS|url= https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/08/nist_is_no_long.html|date= August 3, 2016|accessdate= November 30, 2017|publisher= Schneier on Security}}</ref> A year later NIST reinstated SMS verification as a valid authentication channel in the finalized guideline.<ref>{{cite blog|title= Rollback!

Some vendors have created separate installation packages for [[computer network|network]] login, [[WWW|Web]] access [[credential]]s and [[VPN]] connection [[credential]]s. For such products, there may be four or five different [[software]] packages to push down to the [[Client (computing)|client]] PC in order to make use of the [[Security token|token]] or [[smart card]]. This translates to four or five packages on which version control has to be performed, and four or five packages to check for conflicts with business applications. If access can be operated using [[web page]]s, it is possible to limit the overheads outlined above to a single application. With other multi-factor authentication solutions, such as \"virtual\" tokens and some hardware token products, no software must be installed by end users.\n\nThere are drawbacks to multi-factor authentication that are keeping many approaches from becoming widespread. Some consumers have difficulty keeping track of a hardware token or USB plug. Many consumers do not have the technical skills needed to install a client-side software certificate by themselves. Generally, multi-factor solutions require additional investment for implementation and costs for maintenance. Most hardware token-based systems are proprietary and some vendors charge an annual fee per user. Deployment of [[security token|hardware tokens]] is logistically challenging. Hardware [[Security token|token]]s may get damaged or lost and issuance of [[Security token|token]]s in large industries such as banking or even within large enterprises needs to be managed. In addition to deployment costs, multi-factor authentication often carries significant additional support costs. A 2008 survey<ref>{{cite web\n   |url=http://www.cujournal.com/issues/12_15/-100094-1.html\n   |title=Study Sheds New Light On Costs, Affects Of Multi-Factor|publisher=}}</ref> of over 120 [[Credit unions in the United States|U.S. credit unions]] by the ''Credit Union Journal'' reported on the support costs associated with two-factor authentication.

Examples cited include the U.S. federal government, which employs an elaborate system of physical tokens (which themselves are backed by robust [[Public key infrastructure|Public Key Infrastructure]]), as well as private banks, which tend to prefer multi-factor authentication schemes for their customers that involve more accessible, less expensive means of identity verification, such as an app installed onto a customer-owned smartphone.  Despite the variations that exist among available systems that organizations may have to choose from, once a multi-factor authentication system is deployed within an organization, it tends to remain in place, as users invariably acclimate to the presence and use of the system and embrace it over time as a normalized element of their daily process of interaction with their relevant information system.\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn 2013, [[Kim Dotcom]] claimed to have invented two-factor authentication in a 2000 patent,<ref name = \"US PATENT 6078908\" > {{Cite patent | country = US | number\t= 6078908 | title = Method for authorizing in data transmission systems | inventor = Schmitz, Kim }} </ref> and briefly threatened to sue all the major web services.

It is a method of confirming users' claimed identities by using a combination of ''two'' different factors: 1) something they know, 2) something they have, or 3) something they are.\n\nA good example of two-factor authentication is the withdrawing of money from an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]; only the correct combination of a [[bank card]] (something the user possesses) and a [[Personal identification number|PIN]] (something the user knows) allows the transaction to be carried out.\n\nTwo other examples are to supplement a user-controlled password with a [[one-time password]] (OTP) or code generated or received by an [[authenticator]]  (e.g. a security token or smartphone) that only the user possesses.\n\n'''Two-step verification''' or '''two-step authentication''' is a method of confirming a user's claimed identity by utilizing something they know (password) and a second factor {{em|other}} than something they have or something they are. An example of a second step is the user repeating back something that was sent to them through an [[out-of-band]] mechanism (such as a code sent over SMS), or a number generated by an [[Mobile app|app]] that is common to the user and the [[Authentication and Key Agreement|authentication system]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/41939/two-step-vs-two-factor-authentication-is-there-a-difference|title=Two-Step vs. Two-Factor Authentication - Is there a difference?|website=Information Security Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==Authentication factors==\nThe use of multiple authentication factors to prove one's identity is based on the premise that an unauthorized actor is unlikely to be able to supply the factors required for access. If, in an authentication attempt, at least one of the components is missing or supplied incorrectly, the user's identity is not established with sufficient certainty and access to the asset (e.g., a building, or data) being protected by multi-factor authentication then remains blocked. The authentication factors of a multi-factor authentication scheme may include:{{cn|date=November 2019}} \n*'''Something you have''' - some physical object in the possession of the user, such as a [[USB flash drive|USB stick]] with a secret token, a bank card, a key, etc.\n*'''Something you know''' - certain knowledge only known to the user, such as a password, PIN, [[Transaction authentication number|TAN]], etc.\n*'''Something you are''' - some physical characteristic of the user (biometrics), such as a fingerprint, eye iris, voice, typing speed, pattern in key press intervals, etc.\n*'''Somewhere you are''' - some connection to a specific computing network or utilizing a GPS signal to identify the location.<ref>{{Cite thesis|last=Seema|first=Sharma|title=Location Based Authentication|date=2005|publisher=University of New Orleans|url=https://scholarworks.uno.edu/td/141/|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Knowledge factors===\nKnowledge factors are the most commonly used form of authentication. In this form, the user is required to prove knowledge of a secret in order to authenticate.\n\nA [[password]] is a secret word or string of characters that is used for user authentication. This is the most commonly used mechanism of authentication. Many multi-factor authentication techniques rely on password as one factor of authentication. Variations include both longer ones formed from multiple words (a [[passphrase]]) and the shorter, purely numeric, [[personal identification number]] (PIN) commonly used for [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] access. Traditionally, passwords are expected to be [[memory|memorized]].\n\nMany [[secret question]]s such as \"Where were you born?\" are poor examples of a knowledge factor because they may be known to a wide group of people, or be able to be researched.\n\n===Possession factors===\nPossession factors (\"something the user and only the user has\") have been used for authentication for centuries, in the form of a key to a lock. The basic principle is that the key embodies a secret which is shared between the lock and the key, and the same principle underlies possession factor authentication in computer systems. A [[security token]] is an example of a possession factor.\n\n===={{Anchor|HARD-TOKEN}}Disconnected tokens====\n[[File:SecureID token new.JPG|thumbnail|[[RSA SecurID]] token, an example of a disconnected token generator]]\nDisconnected tokens have no connections to the client computer. They typically use a built-in screen to display the generated authentication data, which is manually typed in by the user.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2019/12/03/141-cybersecurity-predictions-for-2020/|title=141 Cybersecurity Predictions For 2020|last=Press|first=Gil|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>{{Better source|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Connected tokens====\nConnected tokens are [[machine|devices]] that are ''physically'' connected to the computer to be used. Those devices transmit data automatically.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title  = Encyclopedia of Cryptography and Security, Volume 1|last =|first =|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|year = 2011|isbn = 9781441959058|location =|page = 1305|editor-last =van Tilborg|editor-first = Henk C.A.|editor-last2 = Jajodia|editor-first2 = Sushil}}</ref> There are a number of different types, including card readers, [[RFID|wireless tags]] and USB tokens.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n====Software tokens====\nA [[software token]] (a.k.a. ''soft token'') is a type of [[two-factor authentication]] security device that may be used to authorize the use of computer services. Software tokens are stored on a general-purpose electronic device such as a [[desktop computer]], [[laptop]], [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]], or [[mobile phone]] and can be duplicated. (Contrast [[hardware token]]s, where the credentials are stored on a dedicated hardware device and therefore cannot be duplicated, absent physical invasion of the device.)  A soft token may not be a device the user interacts with.  Typically an X.509v3 certificate is loaded onto the device and stored securely to serve this purpose.\n\n===Inherent factors===\nThese are factors associated with the user, and are usually [[Biometrics|biometric]] methods, including [[fingerprint]], [[Face recognition|face]], [[Speaker recognition|voice]], or [[Iris recognition|iris]] recognition. Behavioral biometrics such as [[keystroke dynamics]] can also be used.\n\n===Location based factors===\nIncreasingly, a fourth factor is coming into play involving the physical location of the user.  While hard wired to the corporate network, a user could be allowed to login utilizing only a pin code while off the network entering a code from a soft token as well could be required.  This could be seen as an acceptable standard where access into the office is controlled.\n\nSystems for network admission control work in similar ways where your level of network access can be contingent on the specific network your device is connected to, such as wifi vs wired connectivity.  This also allows a user to move between offices and dynamically receive the same level of network access in each.\n\n==Use of mobile phones==\nMany multi-factor authentication vendors offer mobile phone-based authentication. Some methods include push-based authentication, QR code based authentication, one-time password authentication (event-based and time-based), and SMS-based verification. SMS-based verification suffers from some security concerns. Phones can be cloned, apps can run on several phones and cell-phone maintenance personnel can read SMS texts. Not least, cell phones can be compromised in general, meaning the phone is no longer something only the user has.\n\nThe major drawback of authentication including something the user possesses is that the user must carry around the physical token (the USB stick, the bank card, the key or similar), practically at all times. Loss and theft are risks. Many organizations forbid carrying USB and electronic devices in or out of premises owing to [[malware]] and data theft-risks, and most important machines do not have USB ports for the same reason. Physical tokens usually do not scale, typically requiring a new token for each new account and system. Procuring and subsequently replacing tokens of this kind involves costs. In addition, there are inherent conflicts and unavoidable trade-offs between usability and security.<ref>{{citation |url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/135.pdf |title=Anonymous Two-Factor Authentication in Distributed Systems: Certain Goals Are Beyond Attainment |access-date=2018-03-23}}</ref>\n\nTwo-step authentication involving mobile phones and smartphones provides an alternative to dedicated physical devices. To authenticate, people can use their personal access codes to the device (i.e. something that only the individual user knows) plus a one-time-valid, dynamic passcode, typically consisting of 4 to 6 digits. The passcode can be sent to their mobile device by [[SMS]] or can be generated by a one-time passcode-generator app. In both cases, the advantage of using a mobile phone is that there is no need for an additional dedicated token, as users tend to carry their mobile devices around at all times.\n\n{{As of | 2018}}, SMS is the most broadly-adopted multi-factor authentication method for consumer-facing accounts.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Notwithstanding the popularity of SMS verification, security advocates have publicly criticized it<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/06/hey-stop-using-texts-two-factor-authentication/ |title=So Hey You Should Stop Using Texts For Two-factor Authentication |author=Andy Greenberg |date=2016-06-26 |access-date=2018-05-12 |journal=Wired}}</ref> and in July 2016 a United States [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] draft guideline proposed deprecating it as a form of authentication.<ref>{{cite blog|title= NIST is No Longer Recommending Two-Factor Authentication Using SMS|url= https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/08/nist_is_no_long.html|date= August 3, 2016|accessdate= November 30, 2017|publisher= Schneier on Security}}</ref> A year later NIST reinstated SMS verification as a valid authentication channel in the finalized guideline.<ref>{{cite blog|title= Rollback!

Some vendors have created separate installation packages for [[computer network|network]] login, [[WWW|Web]] access [[credential]]s and [[VPN]] connection [[credential]]s. For such products, there may be four or five different [[software]] packages to push down to the [[Client (computing)|client]] PC in order to make use of the [[Security token|token]] or [[smart card]]. This translates to four or five packages on which version control has to be performed, and four or five packages to check for conflicts with business applications. If access can be operated using [[web page]]s, it is possible to limit the overheads outlined above to a single application. With other multi-factor authentication solutions, such as \"virtual\" tokens and some hardware token products, no software must be installed by end users.\n\nThere are drawbacks to multi-factor authentication that are keeping many approaches from becoming widespread. Some consumers have difficulty keeping track of a hardware token or USB plug. Many consumers do not have the technical skills needed to install a client-side software certificate by themselves. Generally, multi-factor solutions require additional investment for implementation and costs for maintenance. Most hardware token-based systems are proprietary and some vendors charge an annual fee per user. Deployment of [[security token|hardware tokens]] is logistically challenging. Hardware [[Security token|token]]s may get damaged or lost and issuance of [[Security token|token]]s in large industries such as banking or even within large enterprises needs to be managed. In addition to deployment costs, multi-factor authentication often carries significant additional support costs. A 2008 survey<ref>{{cite web\n   |url=http://www.cujournal.com/issues/12_15/-100094-1.html\n   |title=Study Sheds New Light On Costs, Affects Of Multi-Factor|publisher=}}</ref> of over 120 [[Credit unions in the United States|U.S. credit unions]] by the ''Credit Union Journal'' reported on the support costs associated with two-factor authentication. In their report, software certificates and software toolbar approaches were reported to have the highest support costs.\n\nResearch into deployments of multi-factor authentication schemes<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|date=2011  |author1=Libicki, Martin C. |author2=Balkovich, Edward |author3=Jackson, Brian A. |author4=Rudavsky, Rena |author5=Webb, Katharine |title=Influences on the Adoption of Multifactor Authentication |url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR937.html|language=en}}</ref> has shown that one of the elements that tends to impact the adoption of such systems is the line of business of the organization that deploys the multi-factor authentication system.  Examples cited include the U.S. federal government, which employs an elaborate system of physical tokens (which themselves are backed by robust [[Public key infrastructure|Public Key Infrastructure]]), as well as private banks, which tend to prefer multi-factor authentication schemes for their customers that involve more accessible, less expensive means of identity verification, such as an app installed onto a customer-owned smartphone.

Courtship displays have been observed in weebills, where males ruffle cheek and head feathers with outstretched wings to the female.
