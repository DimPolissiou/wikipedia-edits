The piece earned Victor a scholarship \"in recognition of his aesthetic and conceptual integrity\" from the prestigious [[National Sculpture Society]] in New York City. At age 23, Victor was commissioned to produce his proposal of a trio of soldiers for the [[Aberdeen Regional Airport]] War Memorial in South Dakota.\n\nVictor has completed numerous commissions from city, institutions and non-profits for public art works throughout the West and upper Midwest, often to commemorate individuals or groups. He was commissioned by the state of [[Nevada]] to make sculptures of [[Sarah Winnemucca]], a 19th-century [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] activist, one for installation in 2005 at its capitol and one to be installed as one of Nevada's official works in the United States Statuary Hall in the [[United States Capitol Building]], Washington, D.C. At age 26, Victor was the youngest sculptor to have a work installed at the hall.  [[File:Norman Borlaug Statue.jpg|thumb|''Monument to Norman Borlaug''. Bronze, over life-size, 2014.

The piece earned Victor a scholarship \"in recognition of his aesthetic and conceptual integrity\" from the prestigious [[National Sculpture Society]] in New York City. \nAt age 23, Victor was commissioned to produce his proposal of a trio of soldiers for the [[Aberdeen Regional Airport]] War Memorial in South Dakota.\n\nVictor has completed numerous commissions from city, institutions and non-profits for public art works throughout the West and upper Midwest, often to commemorate individuals or groups. He was commissioned by the state of [[Nevada]] to make sculptures of [[Sarah Winnemucca]], a 19th-century [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] activist, one for installation in 2005 at its capitol and one to be installed as one of Nevada's official works in the United States Statuary Hall in the [[United States Capitol Building]], Washington, D.C. At age 26, Victor was the youngest sculptor to have a work installed at the hall. [[File:Norman Borlaug Statue.jpg|thumb|''Monument to Norman Borlaug''. Bronze, over life-size, 2014.

It receives $14 billion from the state and federal governments.\n\nThe mayor's office is located in [[New York City Hall]]; it has jurisdiction over all five [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs]] of New York City: [[Manhattan]], [[Brooklyn]], [[the Bronx]], [[Staten Island]] and [[Queens]]. The mayor appoints numerous officials, including commissioners who head city departments, and his deputy mayors. The mayor's regulations are compiled in title 43 of the ''[[New York City Rules]]''. According to current law, the mayor is limited to two consecutive four-year terms in office but may run again after a four-year break.

For 156 years, the mayor was appointed and had limited power. Between 1783 and 1821 the mayor was appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]] in which the state's governor had the loudest voice. In 1821 the Common Council, which included elected members, gained the authority to choose the mayor. An amendment to the New York State Constitution in 1834 provided for the direct popular election of the mayor. [[Cornelius Van Wyck Lawrence|Cornelius W. Lawrence]], a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], was elected that year.\n\n[[Gracie Mansion]] has been the official residence of the mayor since [[Fiorello La Guardia]]'s administration in 1942. Its main floor is open to the public and serves as a small museum.\n\nThe mayor is entitled to a salary of [[United States dollar|$]]258,750 a year.<ref name=\"lwvnyc1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lwvnyc.org/nycgovern.html |title=League of Women Voters of the City of New York \u2013 About Us |publisher=Lwvnyc.org |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231120643/http://www.lwvnyc.org/nycgovern.html |archivedate=December 31, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Michael Bloomberg]], mayor of the city from 2002 to 2013 and one of the richest people in the world,<ref name=Forbes>{{cite news|title=Forbes Profile|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/|work=Forbes|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref> declined the salary and instead was paid $1 yearly.\n\nIn 2000 direct control of the city's public school system was transferred to the mayor's office.

It played a major role in New York City politics into the 1960s and was a dominant player from the mayoral victory of [[Fernando Wood]] in 1854 through the era of [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.|Robert Wagner]] (1954\u20131965).\n\n== Deputies==\nThe mayor of New York City may appoint several deputy mayors to help oversee major offices within the executive branch of the city government. The powers and duties, and even the number of deputy mayors, are not defined by the City Charter. The post was created by Fiorello La Guardia (who appointed [[Grover Whalen]] as deputy mayor) to handle ceremonial events that the mayor was too busy to attend. Since then, deputy mayors have been appointed with their areas of responsibility defined by the appointing mayor. There are currently five deputy mayors, all of whom report directly to the mayor. \nDeputy mayors do not have any right to succeed to the mayoralty in the case of vacancy or incapacity of the mayor.

The mayor appoints numerous officials, including commissioners who head city departments, and his deputy mayors. The mayor's regulations are compiled in title 43 of the ''[[New York City Rules]]''. According to current law, the mayor is limited to two consecutive four-year terms in office but may run again after a four-year break.

For 156 years, the mayor was appointed and had limited power. Between 1783 and 1821 the mayor was appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]] in which the state's governor had the loudest voice. In 1821 the Common Council, which included elected members, gained the authority to choose the mayor. An amendment to the New York State Constitution in 1834 provided for the direct popular election of the mayor. [[Cornelius Van Wyck Lawrence|Cornelius W. Lawrence]], a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], was elected that year.\n\n[[Gracie Mansion]] has been the official residence of the mayor since [[Fiorello La Guardia]]'s administration in 1942. Its main floor is open to the public and serves as a small museum.\n\nThe mayor is entitled to a salary of [[United States dollar|$]]258,750 a year.<ref name=\"lwvnyc1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lwvnyc.org/nycgovern.html |title=League of Women Voters of the City of New York \u2013 About Us |publisher=Lwvnyc.org |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231120643/http://www.lwvnyc.org/nycgovern.html |archivedate=December 31, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Michael Bloomberg]], mayor of the city from 2002 to 2013 and one of the richest people in the world,<ref name=Forbes>{{cite news|title=Forbes Profile|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/|work=Forbes|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref> declined the salary and instead was paid $1 yearly.\n\nIn 2000 direct control of the city's public school system was transferred to the mayor's office.

It played a major role in New York City politics into the 1960s and was a dominant player from the mayoral victory of [[Fernando Wood]] in 1854 through the era of [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.|Robert Wagner]] (1954\u20131965).\n\n== Deputies==\nThe mayor of New York City may appoint several deputy mayors to help oversee major offices within the executive branch of the city government. The powers and duties, and even the number of deputy mayors, are not defined by the City Charter. The post was created by Fiorello La Guardia (who appointed [[Grover Whalen]] as deputy mayor) to handle ceremonial events that the mayor was too busy to attend. Since then, deputy mayors have been appointed with their areas of responsibility defined by the appointing mayor. There are currently five deputy mayors, all of whom report directly to the mayor. \nDeputy mayors do not have any right to succeed to the mayoralty in the case of vacancy or incapacity of the mayor.
