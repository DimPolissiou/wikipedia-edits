In 635 CE, it became the first city in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to be conquered by the Muslim [[Rashidun army]] and quickly developed into a center of [[Fiqh|Islamic law]]. However, by the time the [[First Crusade|Crusaders]] invaded the country starting in 1099, Gaza was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza experienced several hardships\u2014from [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] raids to floods and locusts, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the [[Ridwan dynasty]] controlled Gaza and under them the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza was established in 1893.\n\nGaza fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a [[Gaza Subdistrict, Mandatory Palestine|part]] of [[Mandatory Palestine]]. As a result of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], [[Egypt]] administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Gaza was captured by [[Israel]] in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, but in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly-created [[Palestinian National Authority]]. In the months following the 2006 election, an [[Fatah-Hamas conflict|armed conflict]] broke out between the Palestinian political factions of [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]], resulting in the latter [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|taking power in Gaza]]. Egypt and Israel consequently imposed a [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade]] on the Gaza Strip.<ref name=\"IBRAHIM BARZAK 07/ 5/11 08:34 AM ET\" /> Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah border crossing in 2011 to pedestrians.<ref name=\"IBRAHIM BARZAK 07/ 5/11 08:34 AM ET\">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/05/gaza-economy-benefits-fro_n_890181.html Gaza Benefiting From Israel Easing Economic Blockade]</ref><ref name=\"IBRAHIM BARZAK 06/21/11 08:13 AM ET\">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/21/gaza-border-opening-bring_n_881127.html Gaza Border Opening Brings Little Relief]</ref>\n\nThe primary economic activities of Gaza are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the blockade and recurring conflicts have put the economy under severe pressure.<ref name=\"Oxfam\" /> The majority of Gaza's inhabitants are [[Muslim]], although there is also a tiny [[Palestinian Christians|Christian minority]].

Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and [[tamarind]]. Many of the traditional dishes rely on [[clay pot cooking]], which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also played an important role in determining many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as ''saliq wa adas'' (\"chard and lentils\") and ''bisara'' (skinless fava beans mashed with dried [[mulukhiya]] leaves and chilies).<ref name=\"Haddad\">[[Laila el-Haddad|El-Haddad, Laila]].

One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Salemdeeb|first1=Ramy|title=Gaza's Challenge|journal=CIWM|date=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://zerowastemena.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/gazas-challenge.html |title=Gaza's Challenge |publisher=CIWM journal |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}</ref>\n\nFor instance, The scale of damage resulting from the [[2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict|Operation Protective Edge]] is unprecedented. All governorates in the Gaza Strip witnessed extensive aerial bombardment, naval shelling and artillery fire, resulting in a considerable amount of rubble. According to recent statistics, more than 2 million tonnes of debris was generated.  Approximately 10,000 houses were leveled to the ground including two 13-story residential buildings. A tremendous amount of debris remains scattered in Gaza. Serious efforts and a high budget are required to handle this challenge.  More importantly, and based on a UNEP study after the 2008 war, the debris is highly likely to be contaminated with PAHs and probably with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furan compounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gaza-toil-rubble-rami-salem?trk=prof-post |title=Gaza: Toil & Rubble |publisher=CIWM journal |date=2014-12-16 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}</ref>\n\n== Health care ==\n[[File:Al-Quds hospital, Gaza City, following Israeli shelling.jpg|thumb|[[Al-Quds hospital]], Gaza City, following Israeli shelling]]\n[[Al-Shifa Hospital]] (\"the Cure\") was founded in the Rimal District by the British Mandate government in the 1940s.

[[State of Palestine]]. Inhabited since at least the 15th century BCE,<ref name = DicHistPl>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Gaza (Gaza Strip) | encyclopedia = International Dictionary of Historic Places |volume=4 |pages= 87\u2013290 |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers |year=1996}}</ref> Gaza has been dominated by several different peoples and empires throughout its history.\n\nThe [[Philistines]] made it a part of their [[Philistia|pentapolis]] after the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians had ruled it for nearly 350 years.\n\nUnder the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] - in their pagan form as well as after the Christianisation of their empire, for which historians use the term [[Byzantine Empire]] - Gaza experienced relative peace and its port flourished. In 635 CE, it became the first city in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to be conquered by the Muslim [[Rashidun army]] and quickly developed into a center of [[Fiqh|Islamic law]]. However, by the time the [[First Crusade|Crusaders]] invaded the country starting in 1099, Gaza was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza experienced several hardships\u2014from [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] raids to floods and locusts, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the [[Ridwan dynasty]] controlled Gaza and under them the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza was established in 1893.\n\nGaza fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a [[Gaza Subdistrict, Mandatory Palestine|part]] of [[Mandatory Palestine]]. As a result of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], [[Egypt]] administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Gaza was captured by [[Israel]] in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, but in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly-created [[Palestinian National Authority]]. In the months following the 2006 election, an [[Fatah-Hamas conflict|armed conflict]] broke out between the Palestinian political factions of [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]], resulting in the latter [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|taking power in Gaza]]. Egypt and Israel consequently imposed a [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade]] on the Gaza Strip.<ref name=\"IBRAHIM BARZAK 07/ 5/11 08:34 AM ET\" /> Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah border crossing in 2011 to pedestrians.<ref name=\"IBRAHIM BARZAK 07/ 5/11 08:34 AM ET\">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/05/gaza-economy-benefits-fro_n_890181.html Gaza Benefiting From Israel Easing Economic Blockade]</ref><ref name=\"IBRAHIM BARZAK 06/21/11 08:13 AM ET\">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/21/gaza-border-opening-bring_n_881127.html Gaza Border Opening Brings Little Relief]</ref>\n\nThe primary economic activities of Gaza are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the blockade and recurring conflicts have put the economy under severe pressure.<ref name=\"Oxfam\" /> The majority of Gaza's inhabitants are [[Muslim]], although there is also a tiny [[Palestinian Christians|Christian minority]].

Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and [[tamarind]]. Many of the traditional dishes rely on [[clay pot cooking]], which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also played an important role in determining many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as ''saliq wa adas'' (\"chard and lentils\") and ''bisara'' (skinless fava beans mashed with dried [[mulukhiya]] leaves and chilies).<ref name=\"Haddad\">[[Laila el-Haddad|El-Haddad, Laila]].

One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Salemdeeb|first1=Ramy|title=Gaza's Challenge|journal=CIWM|date=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://zerowastemena.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/gazas-challenge.html |title=Gaza's Challenge |publisher=CIWM journal |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}</ref>\n\nFor instance, The scale of damage resulting from the [[2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict|Operation Protective Edge]] is unprecedented. All governorates in the Gaza Strip witnessed extensive aerial bombardment, naval shelling and artillery fire, resulting in a considerable amount of rubble. According to recent statistics, more than 2 million tonnes of debris was generated.  Approximately 10,000 houses were leveled to the ground including two 13-story residential buildings. A tremendous amount of debris remains scattered in Gaza. Serious efforts and a high budget are required to handle this challenge.  More importantly, and based on a UNEP study after the 2008 war, the debris is highly likely to be contaminated with PAHs and probably with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furan compounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gaza-toil-rubble-rami-salem?trk=prof-post |title=Gaza: Toil & Rubble |publisher=CIWM journal |date=2014-12-16 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}</ref>\n\n== Health care ==\n[[File:Al-Quds hospital, Gaza City, following Israeli shelling.jpg|thumb|[[Al-Quds hospital]], Gaza City, following Israeli shelling]]\n[[Al-Shifa Hospital]] (\"the Cure\") was founded in the Rimal District by the British Mandate government in the 1940s.

It focuses on [[Online game|online]] [[player versus player]] battles across three boards called lanes, and is based upon the universe of ''[[Dota 2]]'', a [[multiplayer online battle arena]] game also from Valve. ''Artifact'' was designed by ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' creator [[Richard Garfield]]. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]] in November 2018, with versions planned for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].\n\nWhile ''Artifact''{{'s}} gameplay and drafting mechanics received praise, it was criticized for its high [[learning curve]] and [[monetization model]], which some likened to being [[pay-to-win]]. It saw a 95% decline in players within two months of its release, only having around a hundred concurrent players by mid-2019. A reworked version of the game was announced in 2020, with the ability to buy cards being removed.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Artifact screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|''Artifact'' has players competing in three separate boards in sequential order, mimicking the three lanes of ''Dota 2''{{'s}} map.]]\n''Artifact'' is a [[digital collectible card game]] in which players build a deck of collectable cards purchased on the [[Steam Marketplace]] to defeat an opponent in one-on-one battles.<ref name=\"Gameplay\">{{cite web|last1=Marks|first1=Tom|title=Artifact: Everything We Know About Valve's Next Game|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/09/everything-we-know-so-far-about-valves-next-game|website=IGN|accessdate=March 9, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309125326/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/09/everything-we-know-so-far-about-valves-next-game|archivedate=March 9, 2018}}</ref> It features many elements from the [[multiplayer online battle arena]] game ''[[Dota 2]]'', also developed by Valve.<ref name=\"announcement\">{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/8/16116786/valve-artifact-dota-2-card-game |title=Valve announces Artifact, a Dota 2 card game |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |first=Arthur |last=Gies |date=August 8, 2017 |accessdate=August 9, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809073740/https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/8/16116786/valve-artifact-dota-2-card-game |archivedate=August 9, 2017}}</ref> Unlike most collectible card games, it features three \"lanes\" guarded by a tower at the end, with each lane existing as an independent board.

''Artifact'' was designed by ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' creator [[Richard Garfield]].

They were the first in an increasing series significant outbreaks of maritime [[Atlantic revolutions|radicalism in the Atlantic World]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Frykman|first=Niklas|year=2013|title=Connections Between Mutinies in European Navies|url=|journal=International Review of Social History|volume=58|pages=87\u2013107|doi=10.1017/s0020859013000230|doi-access=free}}</ref> Despite their temporal proximity, the mutinies differed in character. The Spithead mutiny was a simple [[strike action]] to address economic grievances, while the Nore mutiny was a more radical action, articulating political ideals as well.\n\nThe mutinies were extremely concerning for [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], because at the time the country was at [[French Revolutionary Wars|war with Revolutionary France]], and the Navy was the most significant component of the war effort. There were also concerns among the government that the mutinies might be part of wider attempts at revolutionary sedition instigated by societies such as the [[London Corresponding Society]] and the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]].\n\n==Spithead==\nThe mutiny at [[Spithead]] (an [[Anchorage (maritime)|anchor]]age near [[Portsmouth]]) lasted from 16 April to 15 May 1797. Sailors on 16 ships in the [[Channel Fleet]], commanded by Admiral [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Lord Bridport]], protested against the living conditions aboard [[Royal Navy]] vessels and demanded a pay rise, better victualling, increased shore leave, and compensation for sickness and injury.<ref name=\":1\">Council of Delegates at Spithead \"From the Delegates to the Admiralty\" in ''The Naval Mutinies of 1797'' ed. Conrad Gill (Manchester University Press, 1913), 362-363.</ref> On 26 April a supportive mutiny broke out on 15 ships in [[Plymouth]], who sent delegates to Spithead to take part in negotiations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Naval Mutinies of 1797|last=Coats|first=Ann Veronica|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 45}}</ref>\n\nSeamen's pay rates had been established in 1658, and because of the stability of wages and prices, they were still reasonable as recently as the 1756\u20131763 [[Seven Years' War]]; however, high inflation during the last decades of the 18th century had severely eroded the real value of the pay. In recent years, pay raises had also been granted to the army, militia, and naval officers.<ref name=\":1\" /> At the same time, the practice of [[Copper sheathing|coppering]] the submerged part of [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]], which had started in 1761, meant that British warships no longer had to return to port frequently to have their hulls scraped, and the additional time at sea significantly altered the rhythm and difficulty of seamen's work. The Royal Navy had not made adjustments for any of these changes, and was slow to understand their effects on its crews. Finally, the new wartime [[Quota System (Royal Navy)|quota system]] meant that crews had many landsmen from inshore who did not mix well with the career seamen, leading to discontented ships' companies.\n\nThe mutineers were led by elected delegates and tried to negotiate with the [[Admiralty]] for two weeks, focusing their demands on better pay, the abolition of the 14-ounce \"purser's pound\" (the ship's purser was allowed to keep two ounces of every true pound\u201416 ounces\u2014of meat as a [[wikt:perquisite|perquisite]]), and the removal of a handful of unpopular officers; neither [[flogging]] nor [[impressment]] was mentioned in the mutineers' demands. The mutineers maintained regular naval routine and discipline aboard their ships (mostly with their regular officers), allowed some ships to leave for convoy escort duty or patrols, and promised to suspend the mutiny and go to sea immediately if French ships were spotted heading for English shores.<ref>Earl Spencer \"Spencer's Diary, 18 April 1797\" in ''The Naval Mutinies of 1797'' ed.

The Spithead mutiny was a simple [[strike action]] to address economic grievances, while the Nore mutiny was a more radical action, articulating political ideals as well.\n\nThe mutinies were extremely concerning for [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], because at the time the country was at [[French Revolutionary Wars|war with Revolutionary France]], and the Navy was the most significant component of the war effort. There were also concerns among the government that the mutinies might be part of wider attempts at revolutionary sedition instigated by societies such as the [[London Corresponding Society]] and the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]].\n\n==Spithead==\nThe mutiny at [[Spithead]] (an [[Anchorage (maritime)|anchor]]age near [[Portsmouth]]) lasted from 16 April to 15 May 1797. Sailors on 16 ships in the [[Channel Fleet]], commanded by Admiral [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Lord Bridport]], protested against the living conditions aboard [[Royal Navy]] vessels and demanded a pay rise, better victualling, increased shore leave, and compensation for sickness and injury.<ref name=\":1\">Council of Delegates at Spithead \"From the Delegates to the Admiralty\" in ''The Naval Mutinies of 1797'' ed. Conrad Gill (Manchester University Press, 1913), 362-363.</ref> On 26 April a supportive mutiny broke out on 15 ships in [[Plymouth]], who sent delegates to Spithead to take part in negotiations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Naval Mutinies of 1797|last=Coats|first=Ann Veronica|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 45}}</ref>\n\nSeamen's pay rates had been established in 1658, and because of the stability of wages and prices, they were still reasonable as recently as the 1756\u20131763 [[Seven Years' War]]; however, high inflation during the last decades of the 18th century had severely eroded the real value of the pay. In recent years, pay raises had also been granted to the army, militia, and naval officers.<ref name=\":1\" /> At the same time, the practice of [[Copper sheathing|coppering]] the submerged part of [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]], which had started in 1761, meant that British warships no longer had to return to port frequently to have their hulls scraped, and the additional time at sea significantly altered the rhythm and difficulty of seamen's work. The Royal Navy had not made adjustments for any of these changes, and was slow to understand their effects on its crews. Finally, the new wartime [[Quota System (Royal Navy)|quota system]] meant that crews had many landsmen from inshore who did not mix well with the career seamen, leading to discontented ships' companies.\n\nThe mutineers were led by elected delegates and tried to negotiate with the [[Admiralty]] for two weeks, focusing their demands on better pay, the abolition of the 14-ounce \"purser's pound\" (the ship's purser was allowed to keep two ounces of every true pound\u201416 ounces\u2014of meat as a [[wikt:perquisite|perquisite]]), and the removal of a handful of unpopular officers; neither [[flogging]] nor [[impressment]] was mentioned in the mutineers' demands. The mutineers maintained regular naval routine and discipline aboard their ships (mostly with their regular officers), allowed some ships to leave for convoy escort duty or patrols, and promised to suspend the mutiny and go to sea immediately if French ships were spotted heading for English shores.<ref>Earl Spencer \"Spencer's Diary, 18 April 1797\" in ''The Naval Mutinies of 1797'' ed.
