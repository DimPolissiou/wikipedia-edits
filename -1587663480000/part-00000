Pollen from the flowers covers the face of the coati following feeding, and later disseminates through the surrounding forest following detachment. Scientists observed a dependent relationship between the balsa tree, which provides a critical resource of hydration and nutrition to the white-nosed coati when environment resources are scarce, and the coati, which increases proliferation of the tree through pollination.\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Nasua narica}}\n*[http://www.mnh.si.edu/mna/image_info.cfm?species_id=208 Smithsonian Institution \u2013 North American Mammals: Nasua narica]\n*[http://siwild.si.edu/content/animal-groups/other-carnivores/white-nosed-coati.htm?species=130 Smithsonian Wild: Nasua narica]\n\n{{Procyonidae nav}}\n{{Carnivora|C.}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q754992}}\n\n[[Category:Procyonidae]]\n[[Category:Carnivorans of North America|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Carnivorans of Central America|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Carnivorans of South America|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Colombia|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Costa Rica|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Guatemala|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Mexico|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Mammals of the United States|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Fauna of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1766]]\n[[Category:Least concern biota of North America|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Least concern biota of South America|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Species of mammal}}\n{{For|the South American relative|South American coati}}{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| status = LC\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status_ref = <ref name=iucn>{{cite iucn |publisher=[[IUCN]] |title=Nasua narica |authors=Cuar\u00f3n, A.

They readily adapt to human presence; like [[raccoon]]s, they will raid campsites and trash receptacles.  They can be tamed easily, and have been verified experimentally to be quite [[Animal cognition|intelligent]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:White nosed Coati.jpg|left|thumb|A white-nosed coati in a [[conservation area]] in [[Arenal Tilaran Conservation Area|Arenal, Costa Rica]]]]\nWhile the [[raccoon]] and ringtail are nocturnal, coatis are [[Diurnality|active by day]], retiring during the night to a specific tree and descending at dawn to begin their daily search for food. However, their habits are adjustable, and in areas where they are hunted by humans for food, or where they raid human settlements for their own food, they might become more [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]].  Adult males are [[Lone wolf (trait)|solitary]], but females and sexually immature males form [[Social unit|social groups]]. They use many vocal signals to [[Animal communication|communicate]] with one another, and also spend time grooming themselves and each other with their teeth and claws. During [[foraging]] times, the young cubs are left with a pair of babysitters, similar to [[meerkat]]s. The young males and even some females tend to [[Play fighting|play-fight]]. Many of the [[coati]]s will have short [[Combat|fights]] over food.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nWhite-nosed coatis are known pollinators of the balsa tree, as observed in a study of a white-nosed coati population in Costa Rica. <ref name=Mora>Mora, Jos\u00e9 Manuel. (1999). ''[https://tropicalstudies.org/rbt/attachments/volumes/vol47-4/08_Mora_Nasua_narica.pdf White-nosed coati Nasua narica (Carnivora: Procyonidae) as a potentialpollinator of Ochroma pyramidale (Bombacaceae)].'' Revista de biologia tropical 47(4):719-721</ref> The coati were observed inserting their noses into the flowers of the tree and ingesting nectar, while the flower showed no subsequent signs of damage. Pollen from the flowers covers the face of the coati following feeding, and later disseminates through the surrounding forest following detachment. Scientists observed a dependent relationship between the balsa tree, which provides a critical resource of hydration and nutrition to the white-nosed coati when environment resources are scarce, and the coati, which increases proliferation of the tree through pollination.\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Nasua narica}}\n*[http://www.mnh.si.edu/mna/image_info.cfm?species_id=208 Smithsonian Institution \u2013 North American Mammals: Nasua narica]\n*[http://siwild.si.edu/content/animal-groups/other-carnivores/white-nosed-coati.htm?species=130 Smithsonian Wild: Nasua narica]\n\n{{Procyonidae nav}}\n{{Carnivora|C.}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q754992}}\n\n[[Category:Procyonidae]]\n[[Category:Carnivorans of North America|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Carnivorans of Central America|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Carnivorans of South America|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Colombia|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Costa Rica|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Guatemala|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Mexico|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Mammals of the United States|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Fauna of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1766]]\n[[Category:Least concern biota of North America|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Least concern biota of South America|Coati, white-nosed]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n", "name_user": "Roqz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBehavior:proper conservation area related to arenal volcano... but might not be an adequate caption at all", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-nosed_coati"}

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\".<ref name=thesis/> It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children.<ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Their project to publish drawings and testimonies of children in war received the support of [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Romain Rolland]] who \"regarded this collection as of considerable educational, historical and human interest.\"<ref name=\"Yannick Ripa\"/>\n \nIn 1939, Alfred Brauner welcomed 130 Jewish children from the Palatinate, Berlin and Austria,<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> survivors of the [[Kristallnacht]] at La Guette, a French castle owned by the Rothschild family and made available by [[Baroness Germaine de Rothschild]].<ref name=\"La Guette\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-Chateau-de-la-Guette-245.html |title= Ch\u00e2teau de la Guette durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale (WWII) |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= www.ajpn.org/index.php | publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lochy  | first1 = Emilie | authorlink = | title = Extrait de l'ouvrage : Enfances en guerre - T\u00e9moignages d'enfants sur la guerre | doi = | journal = Le Cercle Psy | volume = 12  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2014 | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Alfred\u2019s  intention was to analyze the problems posed in working with children traumatized by their experiences and by separation from their families, with the aim of adapting them to a new life and preparing them for integration into France.<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> He then described this educational experience in his state thesis, defended in 1946, entitled \"The Psychic Repercussions of Modern War on Childhood.\"<ref name=thesis/>\n \nFrom January 1941, Alfred Brauner entered the [[French Resistance]] and welcomed the [[Austrian resistance]]\u2019s leadership in his [[Rue Bonaparte]] apartment in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> With members of the [[\u00d6sterreichische Freiheitsfront]] arriving every morning at a specific time, Alfred Brauner decided to open a German Language course as a cover from [[Gestapo]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/> In 1945, he helped welcoming and educating 444 surviving boys from the [[Auschwitz]] and [[Buchenwald]] [[concentration camps]], in the scope of the [[Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants]] (OSE) in [[Ecouis]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Boltanski\">{{cite book | author = Christophe Boltanski | title = La Cache | page= | publisher = Stock | year = 2015  | isbn = 978-2-234-07637-2}}</ref><ref name=\"L'accueil\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> This welcoming of Buchenwald's child survivors in children's homes inspired the script of the film [[Nina's House]],<ref name=\" \">{{Cite web|url= https://jeudisducinema.be/La-maison-de-Nina |title= La maison de Nina |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= jeudisducinema.be/ | publisher=Les jeudis du cinema }}</ref> as well as the documentary [[The Boys of Buchenwald]].\n \nIn 1950, Alfred Brauner created the \"Practical Research for Children,\" which brings together professionals of childhood in order to develop medico-pedagogical methods intended for the education of children with mental disabilities.<ref name=\"Mintec\"/> In 1955, he founded a day hospital for mentally and physically handicapped children located in the center of Paris, then transferred to Saint-Mand\u00e9, and worked on the rehabilitation of these children, giving priority to their education.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> Alfred Brauner was the ambassador of the association \"''Children Refugees of the World,''\" as well as the only non-physician president of the ''Society of Expression Psychopathology and Art Therapy''.<ref name=\"SFPE\">{{Cite web|url= https://www.sfpe-art-therapie.fr/Quelques-dates-qui-marquent-les-avancees-sur-trois-voies-paralleles_a34.html |title= Quelques dates qui marquent les avanc\u00e9es sur trois voies parall\u00e8les.

The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires.

During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offenses. However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]].

Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moor\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R.

There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nAfter [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].)

This is problematic, since the original has been lost and the three writers who attended the Council of Clermont recorded three different versions which are each quite distinctive in content and style.<ref name=\"Strack\">{{cite journal|last=Strack|first=Georg|title=The Sermon of Urban II in Clermont and the Tradition of Papal Oratory|journal=medieval sermon studies|volume=5|year=2012|pages=30-45|url=https://www.mag.geschichte.uni-muenchen.de/downloads/strack_urban.pdf|access-date= April 22, 2020}}</ref>. \n\nHowever, there is some consensus that a comparison of the best 5 versions of the sermon (the three witnesses and two they told personally) makes it possible to identify the subjects Urban discussed. '''''The necessity of aiding the brethren in the East''''' is in all versions; that there were '''''appeals for aid from the East''''' is mentioned in four of the five best sources; '''''the victorious advance of the Turks''''' is mentioned in three and assumed in the other two; '''''the suffering of Christians and/or pilgrims in the East''''' is mentioned by all; '''''desecration or destruction of churches and Christian Holy places''''' is mentioned by all; the idea '''''this is God's work''''' is mentioned by all; that '''''rich and poor alike should go''''' is mentioned only by one; '''''plenary indulgence''''' is mentioned by all and confirmed by the canon of the Council; expressions of '''''contempt for Turks''''' are present in all, use the common terms of the era, and whether they are from the authors or Urban is unknown; fight a '''''righteous war instead of local combats''''' is mentioned in all versions; and the '''''special sanctity of Jerusalem''''' is mentioned by three.<ref name=\"Munro\">{{cite journal|last=Munro|first= Dana Carleton|title=The Speech of Pope Urban II.

The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the ''vita apostolica'' and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offenses. However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]].

Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moor\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R.

There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nAfter [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n==Early Christian Thought==\nIn Roman empire, by the first century, the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Middle Platonism|the middle Platonists]] were developing a philosophical monotheism that saw all gods as aspects of the \"one god.\" This provided the ideology for a kind of 'theological tolerance' which became characteristic of paganism in the imperial age.<ref name=\"Meeks\">{{cite book|last=Meeks|first=Wayne A.|title=The First Urban Christians|publisher=Yale University|edition=second|year=2003|ISBN=0-300-09861-8}}</ref>{{rp|165}}  However, Meeks points out that, even with this philosophical development, Christian groups were much more inclusive in terms of social stratification and other social categories than were the Roman voluntary associations.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|79}} Following the teaching of Paul in Colossians 3:11, heterogeneity characterized the Pauline groups, and the role of women was much greater than in either Judaism or paganism.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|81}} Early Christians were told to love others, even enemies, to treat each other as family, and Christians of all sorts called each other \"brother\" and \"sister.\" These concepts and practices were foundational to early Christian thought, have remained central, and can be seen as early precursors to modern concepts of tolerance.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|88-90}}  \n\n[[Tertullian|Tertullian]] (155-200 CE) was a Christian intellectual in late second century Africa who advocated for religious tolerance.

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the ''vita apostolica'' and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.
