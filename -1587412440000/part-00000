After raiding down the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] coast and fighting their way through Gibraltar, the Norsemen pillaged the south of France, where the fleet stayed over winter, before landing in Italy where they captured the city of [[Pisa]].<ref>''Annales de Saint Bertin'', Anno 859, 860 [http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/historiens/anonyme/annales.htm]</ref> Flush with this victory and others around the Mediterranean (including in [[Sicily]] and North Africa) during the Mediterranean expedition, the Vikings are recorded to have lost 40 ships to a storm. They returned to the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] and, at the coast of [[Medina-Sidonia]], lost 2 ships to fire catapults in a surprise raid by [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] forces, leaving only 20 ships intact. The remnants of the fleet came back to French waters in 862. Bj\u00f6rn Ironside was the leader of the expedition according to the later chronicle of William of Jumi\u00e8ges. The early 11th century ''[[Fragmentary Annals of Ireland]]'' say that two sons of Ragnall mac Albdan, a chief who had been expelled from [[Lochlann]] by his brothers and stayed in the [[Orkney Islands]], headed the enterprise.<ref>Gustav Storm (1877), ''Historisk Tidskrift'' II:1, p. 420 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639;view=1up;seq=420]</ref>\n\nWilliam of Jumi\u00e8ges refers to Bj\u00f6rn as ''Bier Costae ferreae'' (Ironside) who was ''Lotbroci regis filio'' (son of King Lodbrok).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.dur.ac.uk/medieval.www/sagaconf/mcturk.htm ''Kings and kingship in Viking Northumbria'', by [[Rory McTurk]] (University of Leeds)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926171200/http://www.dur.ac.uk/medieval.www/sagaconf/mcturk.htm |date=September 26, 2008 }}</ref> William's account of the Mediterranean expedition centers around Bj\u00f6rn's foster-father [[Hastein]]. The two Vikings conducted many (mostly successful) raids in [[France]]. Later on Hastein got the idea to make Bj\u00f6rn the new Roman Emperor and led a large Viking raid into the [[Mediterranean]] together with his proteg\u00e9e. They proceeded inland to the town of [[Luni, Italy|Luni]], which they believed to be [[Rome]] at the time, but were unable to breach the town walls. To gain entry a tricky plan was devised: Hastein sent messengers to the bishop to say that, being deathly ill, he had a deathbed conversion and wished to receive Christian sacraments and/or to be buried on consecrated ground within their church. He was brought into the chapel with a small honor guard, then surprised the dismayed clerics by leaping from his stretcher. The Viking party then hacked its way to the town gates, which were promptly opened letting the rest of the army in. When they realised that Luni was not Rome, Bj\u00f6rn and Hastein wished to investigate this city but changed their minds when they heard that the Romans were well prepared for defense. After returning to West Europe, the two men parted company. Bj\u00f6rn was shipwrecked at the English coast and barely survived. He then went to [[Frisia]] where William says he died.<ref>Guillaume de Jumi\u00e8ges, ''Histoire des ducs de Normandie'', p. 20 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015013753564;view=1up;seq=32]</ref>  There are some historical challenges with this account. Hastein appears in the contemporary sources later than Bj\u00f6rn, and in order to be his foster-father would have been around his 80s when he died. That is not impossible, citing the fact that their contemporaries, the Viking [[Rollo]] and King [[Harald Fairhair]] of Norway lived comparable lifespans. Luni is also known to have been plundered by [[Saracens]].<ref>Gustav Storm (1877), ''Historisk Tidskrift'' II:1 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639;view=1up;seq=432]</ref>\n\n==''The Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok'' and ''Tale of Ragnar's Sons''==\nThe story of Bj\u00f6rn and his brothers, the sons of the Scandinavian king [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], was retold in different versions throughout the Middle Ages. The ''[[Tale of Ragnar's Sons]]'' (''[[Ragnarssona \u00fe\u00e1ttr]]'') is an Icelandic [[Fornaldar Saga]] from about the 14th century that combines traditional [[Norse mythology|Norse]] oral history with legendary themes. It states that Bj\u00f6rn was the son of Ragnar and [[Aslaug]]<!--- Not Lagertha. That is an inventions of the TV show Vikings---><ref>{{cite web |translator-last= Tunstall |translator-first=Peter |title=The Saga of Ragnar Lodrok and his Sons |url=http://www.germanicmythology.com/FORNALDARSAGAS/ThattrRagnarsSonar.html |year=2005 }}</ref><ref>Peter August G\u00f6decke in ''Sagan om Ragnar Lodbrok och hans s\u00f6ner'' [[Norstedts]] Stockholm 1880 p. 24</ref> and that his brothers were [[Hvitserk]], [[Ivar the Boneless]], and [[Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye]]. The tale also tells of Bj\u00f6rn's half-brothers Eric and Agnar.\n\nThe saga portrays Ragnar as the overlord of large parts of Sweden and possibly even Denmark. While he was still alive, Bj\u00f6rn and his brothers left Sweden to conquer [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], [[Reidgotaland]] (here [[Jutland]]), [[Gotland]], [[\u00d6land]] and all the minor islands. They then settled at [[Lejre]] in Zealand, Denmark with Ivar the Boneless as their leader.\n\nRagnar's sons Eric and Agnar then sailed into Lake [[M\u00e4laren]] and sent a message to the Swedish King [[\u00d6sten Beli|Eysteinn]], a vassal of Ragnar, that they wanted him to submit to Ragnar's sons. Moreover, Eric said that he wanted Eysteinn's daughter Borghild as wife. Eysteinn said that he first wanted to consult the Swedish chieftains. The chieftains said no to the offer, and ordered an attack on the rebellious sons. A battle ensued and Eric and Agnar were overwhelmed by the Swedish forces, whereupon Agnar died and Eric was taken prisoner.\n\nEysteinn offered Eric as much of [[Uppsala \u00f6d]] as he wanted, and Borghild, in [[wergild]] for Agnar. Eric proclaimed that after such a defeat he wanted nothing but to choose the day of his own death. Eric asked to be impaled on spears that raised him above the dead and his wish was granted. In [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], Bj\u00f6rn, Aslaug and Hvitserk, who had been playing [[tafl]], became upset and sailed to Sweden with a large army. Aslaug rode with cavalry across the land. In a great battle they killed Eysteinn.\n\nAccording to the saga, their father Ragnar was captured and killed by King [[Aelle II of Northumbria|\u00c6lla]] in England after a foolhardy invasion attempt. Bj\u00f6rn and his brothers, seeking revenge, attacked \u00c6lla but were beaten back. As Ivar realised that the English king could not be defeated right away, he sought reconciliation. He only asked for as much land as he could cover with an ox's hide and swore never to wage war against \u00c6lla. Then Ivar cut the ox's hide into such fine strands that he could envelop a large fortress (in an older saga it was York and according to a younger saga it was London) which he could take as his own. Ivar made himself popular in England and asked his brothers to attack again. During the battle Ivar sided with his brothers and so did many of the English chieftains with their people, in loyalty to Ivar. \u00c6lla was taken captive and in revenge they carved the [[blood eagle]] on him.\n\nLater Bj\u00f6rn and his brothers pillaged in England, [[Normandy]], France, and [[Lombardy]], until they came to the town [[Luna (Etruria)|Luna]] in Italy. When they came back to Scandinavia, they divided the kingdom so that Bj\u00f6rn Ironside took [[Uppsala]] and Sweden.<ref>''The Tale of Ragnar's Sons'' [http://www.germanicmythology.com/FORNALDARSAGAS/ThattrRagnarsSonar.html]</ref>\n\n==Other sources==\nThe partly legendary Danish chronicle of [[Saxo Grammaticus]], ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' (c. 1200), is the first text to mention Bj\u00f6rn Ironside as a King of Sweden. According to Saxo, Ragnar Lodbrok had a quarrel with the recently elevated ruler of the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]], S\u00f6rle. He therefore invaded the Swedish lands in company with his sons Bj\u00f6rn, Fridleif and Radbard. Before battle had broken out, the opposing sides agreed to settle the matter through a combat. Ragnar and his three sons met the renowned champion Starkad and his seven sons in the sight of the two armies. \"Bj\u00f6rn, having inflicted great slaughter on the foe without hurt to himself, gained from the strength of his sides, which were like iron, a perpetual name [i.e., Ironside]\". Ragnar and his sons slew their eight opponents, after which their troops fell on S\u00f6rle and his army and annihilated them. Ragnar then \"presented Bj\u00f6rn with the lordship of Sweden for his conspicuous bravery and service.\" Later on, another son of Ragnar, [[Ubbe Ragnarsson|Ubbe]], colluded with his maternal grandfather Esbj\u00f6rn and conspired against Ragnar. Esbj\u00f6rn sent envoys to Bj\u00f6rn in Sweden to drum up support for a rebellion, but Bj\u00f6rn refused to listen. Instead, he hanged the envoys while their party were slaughtered by the Swedes. Shortly afterwards Esbj\u00f6rn was slain in a sea battle, and Ubbe was captured after a heroic resistance. In due time Ragnar appointed Bj\u00f6rn regent of Norway, while Sweden was handed over to another son, [[Eric Weatherhat]]. After the death of Ragnar, Bj\u00f6rn and his brothers attacked [[Aelle II of Northumbria|Ella]] in England with 400 ships and killed him. He then went back to his Swedish kingdom, but intervened in Denmark when the Danes rose against the rule of Ragnar's sons. With a fleet of 1,700 ships, he and his brothers crushed the insurgents at [[Hedeby|Slesvig]]. This is the last we hear about Bj\u00f6rn Ironside in the ''Gesta Danorum''.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, ''The Danish History'', Book IX [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1150/1150-h/1150-h.htm#link2H_4_0027]</ref> \n\nThe ''[[Hervarar saga]]'' from the 13th century tells that [[Eysteinn Beli]] was killed by Bj\u00f6rn and his brothers as told in ''Ragnar Lodbrok's saga'', and they conquered all of Sweden. When Ragnar died Bj\u00f6rn Ironside inherited Sweden. He had two sons, [[Refil Bj\u00f6rnsson|Refil]] and [[Erik Bj\u00f6rnsson]], who became the next king of Sweden.<ref name=\"vsnrweb-publications60\"/> According to the ''[[Saga of Erik the Red]]'', Bj\u00f6rn had a son named [[Asleik Bj\u00f6rnsson|Asleik]] (Aslak), who was the ancestor of [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]].\n\nAnglo-Saxon and Irish sources suggest that the Danish invasion of England after 865 was led by three brothers called [[Ivar Beinlaus|Ingvar]] (i.e. Ivar), [[Ubbe Ragnarsson|Ubbe]] and [[Halfdan Ragnarsson|Halfdan]] who, judging from the Irish ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]'', were sons of a Ragnall (Ragnar or a similar name).<ref>Alfred P.

In his despair Charles the Bald tried to use another Viking chief, [[Veland]], whose men operated in the [[Somme (river)|Somme]] region, to attack the Seine Vikings at Oissel. However, this scheme backfired since the two Viking armies made a deal and united their forces.<ref>''Annales de Saint Bertin'', Anno 861 [http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/historiens/anonyme/annales.htm]</ref> The Norsemen were encamped by the lower Seine in 861-862, but then split again. Veland agreed to become a Christian and joined royal service, while the Seine Vikings went at sea. Some of them joined the fighting between the ruler of [[Brittany|Bretagne]] and some Frankish counts.<ref>''Annales de Saint Bertin'', Anno 862 [http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/historiens/anonyme/annales.htm]</ref>\n\n==Expedition to the Mediterranean==\nA number of Frankish, Norman, Arab, Scandinavian and Irish sources mention a large Viking raid into the [[Mediterranean]] in 859\u2013861, co-led by [[Hastein]], Bj\u00f6rn Ironside and possibly one or more of his brothers. After raiding down the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] coast and fighting their way through Gibraltar, the Norsemen pillaged the south of France, where the fleet stayed over winter, before landing in Italy where they captured the city of [[Pisa]].<ref>''Annales de Saint Bertin'', Anno 859, 860 [http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/historiens/anonyme/annales.htm]</ref> Flush with this victory and others around the Mediterranean (including in [[Sicily]] and North Africa) during the Mediterranean expedition, the Vikings are recorded to have lost 40 ships to a storm. They returned to the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] and, at the coast of [[Medina-Sidonia]], lost 2 ships to fire catapults in a surprise raid by [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] forces, leaving only 20 ships intact. The remnants of the fleet came back to French waters in 862. Bj\u00f6rn Ironside was the leader of the expedition according to the later chronicle of William of Jumi\u00e8ges. The early 11th century ''[[Fragmentary Annals of Ireland]]'' say that two sons of Ragnall mac Albdan, a chief who had been expelled from [[Lochlann]] by his brothers and stayed in the [[Orkney Islands]], headed the enterprise.<ref>Gustav Storm (1877), ''Historisk Tidskrift'' II:1, p. 420 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639;view=1up;seq=420]</ref>\n\nWilliam of Jumi\u00e8ges refers to Bj\u00f6rn as ''Bier Costae ferreae'' (Ironside) who was ''Lotbroci regis filio'' (son of King Lodbrok).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.dur.ac.uk/medieval.www/sagaconf/mcturk.htm ''Kings and kingship in Viking Northumbria'', by [[Rory McTurk]] (University of Leeds)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926171200/http://www.dur.ac.uk/medieval.www/sagaconf/mcturk.htm |date=September 26, 2008 }}</ref> William's account of the Mediterranean expedition centers around Bj\u00f6rn's foster-father [[Hastein]]. The two Vikings conducted many (mostly successful) raids in [[France]]. Later on Hastein got the idea to make Bj\u00f6rn the new Roman Emperor and led a large Viking raid into the [[Mediterranean]] together with his proteg\u00e9e. They proceeded inland to the town of [[Luni, Italy|Luni]], which they believed to be [[Rome]] at the time, but were unable to breach the town walls. To gain entry a tricky plan was devised: Hastein sent messengers to the bishop to say that, being deathly ill, he had a deathbed conversion and wished to receive Christian sacraments and/or to be buried on consecrated ground within their church. He was brought into the chapel with a small honor guard, then surprised the dismayed clerics by leaping from his stretcher. The Viking party then hacked its way to the town gates, which were promptly opened letting the rest of the army in. When they realised that Luni was not Rome, Bj\u00f6rn and Hastein wished to investigate this city but changed their minds when they heard that the Romans were well prepared for defense. After returning to West Europe, the two men parted company. Bj\u00f6rn was shipwrecked at the English coast and barely survived. He then went to [[Frisia]] where William says he died.<ref>Guillaume de Jumi\u00e8ges, ''Histoire des ducs de Normandie'', p. 20 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015013753564;view=1up;seq=32]</ref>  There are some historical challenges with this account. Hastein appears in the contemporary sources later than Bj\u00f6rn, and in order to be his foster-father would have been around his 80s when he died. That is not impossible, citing the fact that their contemporaries, the Viking [[Rollo]] and King [[Harald Fairhair]] of Norway lived comparable lifespans. Luni is also known to have been plundered by [[Saracens]].<ref>Gustav Storm (1877), ''Historisk Tidskrift'' II:1 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639;view=1up;seq=432]</ref>\n\n==''The Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok'' and ''Tale of Ragnar's Sons''==\nThe story of Bj\u00f6rn and his brothers, the sons of the Scandinavian king [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], was retold in different versions throughout the Middle Ages. The ''[[Tale of Ragnar's Sons]]'' (''[[Ragnarssona \u00fe\u00e1ttr]]'') is an Icelandic [[Fornaldar Saga]] from about the 14th century that combines traditional [[Norse mythology|Norse]] oral history with legendary themes. It states that Bj\u00f6rn was the son of Ragnar and [[Aslaug]]<!--- Not Lagertha. That is an inventions of the TV show Vikings---><ref>{{cite web |translator-last= Tunstall |translator-first=Peter |title=The Saga of Ragnar Lodrok and his Sons |url=http://www.germanicmythology.com/FORNALDARSAGAS/ThattrRagnarsSonar.html |year=2005 }}</ref><ref>Peter August G\u00f6decke in ''Sagan om Ragnar Lodbrok och hans s\u00f6ner'' [[Norstedts]] Stockholm 1880 p. 24</ref> and that his brothers were [[Hvitserk]], [[Ivar the Boneless]], and [[Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye]]. The tale also tells of Bj\u00f6rn's half-brothers Eric and Agnar.\n\nThe saga portrays Ragnar as the overlord of large parts of Sweden and possibly even Denmark. While he was still alive, Bj\u00f6rn and his brothers left Sweden to conquer [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], [[Reidgotaland]] (here [[Jutland]]), [[Gotland]], [[\u00d6land]] and all the minor islands. They then settled at [[Lejre]] in Zealand, Denmark with Ivar the Boneless as their leader.\n\nRagnar's sons Eric and Agnar then sailed into Lake [[M\u00e4laren]] and sent a message to the Swedish King [[\u00d6sten Beli|Eysteinn]], a vassal of Ragnar, that they wanted him to submit to Ragnar's sons. Moreover, Eric said that he wanted Eysteinn's daughter Borghild as wife. Eysteinn said that he first wanted to consult the Swedish chieftains. The chieftains said no to the offer, and ordered an attack on the rebellious sons. A battle ensued and Eric and Agnar were overwhelmed by the Swedish forces, whereupon Agnar died and Eric was taken prisoner.\n\nEysteinn offered Eric as much of [[Uppsala \u00f6d]] as he wanted, and Borghild, in [[wergild]] for Agnar. Eric proclaimed that after such a defeat he wanted nothing but to choose the day of his own death. Eric asked to be impaled on spears that raised him above the dead and his wish was granted. In [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], Bj\u00f6rn, Aslaug and Hvitserk, who had been playing [[tafl]], became upset and sailed to Sweden with a large army. Aslaug rode with cavalry across the land. In a great battle they killed Eysteinn.\n\nAccording to the saga, their father Ragnar was captured and killed by King [[Aelle II of Northumbria|\u00c6lla]] in England after a foolhardy invasion attempt. Bj\u00f6rn and his brothers, seeking revenge, attacked \u00c6lla but were beaten back. As Ivar realised that the English king could not be defeated right away, he sought reconciliation. He only asked for as much land as he could cover with an ox's hide and swore never to wage war against \u00c6lla. Then Ivar cut the ox's hide into such fine strands that he could envelop a large fortress (in an older saga it was York and according to a younger saga it was London) which he could take as his own. Ivar made himself popular in England and asked his brothers to attack again. During the battle Ivar sided with his brothers and so did many of the English chieftains with their people, in loyalty to Ivar. \u00c6lla was taken captive and in revenge they carved the [[blood eagle]] on him.\n\nLater Bj\u00f6rn and his brothers pillaged in England, [[Normandy]], France, and [[Lombardy]], until they came to the town [[Luna (Etruria)|Luna]] in Italy. When they came back to Scandinavia, they divided the kingdom so that Bj\u00f6rn Ironside took [[Uppsala]] and Sweden.<ref>''The Tale of Ragnar's Sons'' [http://www.germanicmythology.com/FORNALDARSAGAS/ThattrRagnarsSonar.html]</ref>\n\n==Other sources==\nThe partly legendary Danish chronicle of [[Saxo Grammaticus]], ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' (c. 1200), is the first text to mention Bj\u00f6rn Ironside as a King of Sweden. According to Saxo, Ragnar Lodbrok had a quarrel with the recently elevated ruler of the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]], S\u00f6rle. He therefore invaded the Swedish lands in company with his sons Bj\u00f6rn, Fridleif and Radbard. Before battle had broken out, the opposing sides agreed to settle the matter through a combat. Ragnar and his three sons met the renowned champion Starkad and his seven sons in the sight of the two armies. \"Bj\u00f6rn, having inflicted great slaughter on the foe without hurt to himself, gained from the strength of his sides, which were like iron, a perpetual name [i.e., Ironside]\". Ragnar and his sons slew their eight opponents, after which their troops fell on S\u00f6rle and his army and annihilated them. Ragnar then \"presented Bj\u00f6rn with the lordship of Sweden for his conspicuous bravery and service.\" Later on, another son of Ragnar, [[Ubbe Ragnarsson|Ubbe]], colluded with his maternal grandfather Esbj\u00f6rn and conspired against Ragnar. Esbj\u00f6rn sent envoys to Bj\u00f6rn in Sweden to drum up support for a rebellion, but Bj\u00f6rn refused to listen. Instead, he hanged the envoys while their party were slaughtered by the Swedes. Shortly afterwards Esbj\u00f6rn was slain in a sea battle, and Ubbe was captured after a heroic resistance. In due time Ragnar appointed Bj\u00f6rn regent of Norway, while Sweden was handed over to another son, [[Eric Weatherhat]]. After the death of Ragnar, Bj\u00f6rn and his brothers attacked [[Aelle II of Northumbria|Ella]] in England with 400 ships and killed him. He then went back to his Swedish kingdom, but intervened in Denmark when the Danes rose against the rule of Ragnar's sons. With a fleet of 1,700 ships, he and his brothers crushed the insurgents at [[Hedeby|Slesvig]]. This is the last we hear about Bj\u00f6rn Ironside in the ''Gesta Danorum''.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, ''The Danish History'', Book IX [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1150/1150-h/1150-h.htm#link2H_4_0027]</ref> \n\nThe ''[[Hervarar saga]]'' from the 13th century tells that [[Eysteinn Beli]] was killed by Bj\u00f6rn and his brothers as told in ''Ragnar Lodbrok's saga'', and they conquered all of Sweden. When Ragnar died Bj\u00f6rn Ironside inherited Sweden. He had two sons, [[Refil Bj\u00f6rnsson|Refil]] and [[Erik Bj\u00f6rnsson]], who became the next king of Sweden.<ref name=\"vsnrweb-publications60\"/> According to the ''[[Saga of Erik the Red]]'', Bj\u00f6rn had a son named [[Asleik Bj\u00f6rnsson|Asleik]] (Aslak), who was the ancestor of [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]].\n\nAnglo-Saxon and Irish sources suggest that the Danish invasion of England after 865 was led by three brothers called [[Ivar Beinlaus|Ingvar]] (i.e. Ivar), [[Ubbe Ragnarsson|Ubbe]] and [[Halfdan Ragnarsson|Halfdan]] who, judging from the Irish ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]'', were sons of a Ragnall (Ragnar or a similar name).<ref>Alfred P. Smyth (1977), ''Scandinavian kings in the British Isles''. Oxford.</ref> Bj\u00f6rn is not mentioned in this context, but later Norman tradition suggests that he may have been a brother.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> According to William of Jumi\u00e8ges he died in Frisia, which also had an association with the invaders of England. Ubbe is sometimes labeled the \"Frisian Jarl\" and the invaders are occasionally called Scaldingi (men from [[Schelde]]). The kingships of Bj\u00f6rn is at times historically problematic since it is not supported by older sources and presents insurmountable chronological inconsistencies.<ref>Gustav Storm (1877), ''Historisk Tidskrift'' II:1. p. 426, 477-8 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639;view=1up;seq=439]</ref>\n\n==In fiction==\nA principal character in the television series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', played as a young boy by [[Nathan O'Toole]] and through adulthood by [[Alexander Ludwig]], is loosely based on the historical character and portrayed as the son of [[Lagertha]], rather than of [[Aslaug]].

The U.S. declared war and historians have long the multiple factors behind that decision.<ref>Jasper M.

Some historians maintain that an American goal in the war was annex some or all of Canada, a view that many Canadians still share, while others argue that inducing the fear of such a seizure had merely been a U.S. tactic designed to obtain a bargaining chip.<ref name=\"Bowler, pp. 11-32\">Bowler, pp. 11\u201332</ref>  Some members of the British Parliament at the time<ref name=\"Canning\">[[George Canning]],  [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1813/feb/18/address-respecting-the-war-with-america#S1V0024P0_18130218_HOC_15  Address respecting the war with America], ''[[Hansard]]'' (House of Commons), 18 February 1813</ref> and dissident American politicians such as [[John Randolph of Roanoke]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Fregosi|first=Paul|title=Dreams of Empire|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1989|isbn=0-09-173926-8|page=328}}</ref> claimed that land hunger rather than maritime disputes was the main motivation for the American declaration. However, some historians, both Canadian and American, retain the view that desire to annex all or part of Canada was an American goal.<ref>J. C. A. Stagg (1983), Mr Madison's War, p. 4</ref> Although the British made some concessions before the war on neutral trade, they insisted on the right to reclaim their deserting sailors.  The British also had the long-standing goal of creating a large \"neutral\" Indian state that would cover much of Ohio, Indiana and Michigan. They made the demand as late as 1814 at the peace conference, but lost battles that would have validated their claims.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dwight L.

During the course of the war, both the Americans and British launched invasions of each other's territory, all of which were unsuccessful or gained only temporary success. At the end of the war, the British held parts of [[Battle of Hampden|Maine]] and some outposts in the sparsely populated West while the Americans held Canadian territory near Detroit, but these occupied territories were restored at the end of the war.\n\nIn the United States, battles such as [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]] and [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]] (the latter of which inspired the lyrics of the U.S. national anthem, [[The Star-Spangled Banner]]) produced a sense of euphoria over a \"second war of independence\" against Britain. It ushered in an \"[[Era of Good Feelings]]\", in which the partisan animosity that had once verged on treason practically vanished. Canada also emerged from the war with a heightened sense of national feeling and solidarity. Britain, which had regarded the war as a sideshow to the [[Napoleonic Wars]] raging in Europe, was less affected by the fighting; its government and people subsequently welcomed an era of peaceful relations with the United States.\n\n==pp sucker 69==\nThe British were engaged in a  life-and-death war with [[Napoleon]] and could not allow the Americans to help the enemy, regardless of their lawful neutral rights to do so. As Horsman explains, \"If possible, England wished to avoid war with America, but not to the extent of allowing her to hinder the British war effort against France. Moreover...a large section of influential British opinion, both in the government and in the country, thought that America presented a threat to British maritime supremacy.\" <ref>Horsman (1962) p. 264</ref>\n\n===napolean===\nthe British had two goals All parties were committed to the defeat of France, and this required sailors (hence the need for impressment), and it required all-out commercial war against France (hence the restrictions imposed on American merchant ships). On the question of trade with America the British parties split. As Horsman argues, \"Some restrictions on neutral commerce were essential for England in this period. That this restriction took such an extreme form after 1807 stemmed not only from the effort to defeat Napoleon, but also from the undoubted jealousy of America's commercial prosperity that existed in England. America was unfortunate in that for most of the period from 1803 to 1812 political power in England was held by a group that was pledged not only to the defeat of France, but also to a rigid maintenance of Britain's commercial supremacy.\"<ref name=\"Horsman 1962 p. 265\">Horsman (1962) p. 265</ref> That group was weakened by Whigs friendly to the U.S. in mid-1812 and the policies were reversed, but too late for the U.S. had already declared war. By 1815 Britain was no longer controlled by politicians dedicated to commercial supremacy, so that cause had vanished.\n\nThe British were hindered by weak diplomats in Washington (such as [[David Erskine, 2nd Baron Erskine|David Erskine]]) who misrepresented British policy and by communications that were so slow the Americans did not learn of the reversal of policy until they had declared war.\n\nWhen Americans proposed a truce based on British ending impressment, Britain refused, because it needed those sailors. Horsman explains, \"Impressment, which was the main point of contention between England and America from 1803 to 1807, was made necessary primarily because of England's great shortage of seamen for the war against Napoleon. In a similar manner the restrictions on American commerce imposed by England's Orders in Council, which were the supreme cause of complaint between 1807 and 1812, were one part of a vast commercial struggle being waged between England and France.\" <ref name=\"Horsman 1962 p. 265\"/>\n\n===Creating an Indian barrier state between U.S. and Canada===\nThe British also had the long-standing goal of creating an [[Indian barrier state]], a large \"neutral\" Indian state that would cover most of the [[Old Northwest]] and be a barrier between the western parts of the United States and Canada. It would be independent of the United States and under the tutelage of the British, who would use it to block American expansion and to build up their control of the fur trade.<ref>Dwight L. Smith\"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea.\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 61#2-4 (1989): 46-63.</ref>  They made the demand as late as 1814 at the peace conference, but dropped the demand. Their position had been weakened by the collapse of [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]] after the [[Battle of the Thames]], but the British also simply no longer considered the goal worth conflict with the United States.

First, a series of trade restrictions called the Orders in Council (1807) introduced by Britain to impede American trade with [[First French Empire|France]], a country with which Britain was at war; the U.S. contested these restrictions as illegal under international law.<ref name=\"Caffery, pp.56-58\"/> Second, the [[impressment]] (forced recruitment) of U.S. citizens into the [[Royal Navy]]. Third, the alleged British military support for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] who were offering armed resistance to the United States.<ref name=\"Caffery, pp.101-104\"/>  An unstated but powerful motivation for the Americans was the need to uphold national honor in the face of British insults (such as the ''Chesapeake'' affair.)<ref name=\"in JSTOR\"/> There also may have been an American desire to annex      Canada.\n\n===British support for Indian raids===\nIndians based in the [[Northwest Territory]], comprising the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, had organized in opposition to American settlement, and were being supplied with weapons by British traders in Canada.  Britain was not trying to provoke a war, and at one point cut its allocations of gunpowder to the tribes, but it was trying to build up its fur trade and friendly relations with potential military allies.<ref>Mark Zuehlke, ''For Honour's Sake: The War of 1812 and the Brokering of an Uneasy Peace'' (2006) pp 62\u201362</ref> Although Britain had ceded the area to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, it had the long-term goal of creating a \"neutral\" or buffer Indian state in the area that would block further American growth.<ref>Dwight L. Smith, \"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea\", ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly''  (1989) 61 (2\u20134): 46\u201363.</ref>  The Indian nations generally followed [[Tenskwatawa]] (the Shawnee Prophet and the brother of [[Tecumseh]]), who since 1805 had preached his vision of purifying his society by expelling the \"Children of the Evil Spirit\" (the American settlers).<ref>Timothy D. Willig. ''Restoring the Chain of Friendship: British Policy and the Indians of the Great Lakes, 1783\u20131815'' (2008) p. 207.</ref>\n\nPratt says:\n\n<blockquote>There is ample proof that the British authorities did all in their power to hold or win the allegiance of the Indians of the Northwest with the expectation of using them as allies in the event of war. Indian allegiance could be held only by gifts, and to an Indian no gift was as acceptable as a lethal weapon. Guns and ammunition, tomahawks and scalping knives were dealt out with some liberality by British agents.<ref>Julius W. Pratt, ''A history of United States foreign-policy'' (1955) p 126</ref>\nRaiding grew more common in 1810 and 1811; Westerners in Congress found the raids intolerable and wanted them permanently ended.<ref>David S.

The American expansion into the Northwest\u2014Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin\u2014was being blocked by Indians and that was a major cause animating the Westerners.  American historian Walter Nugent in his history of  American expansionism argues that expansion into the Midwest \"was not the only American objective, and indeed not the immediate one area but it was an objective.\"<ref>Walter Nugent, ''Habits of Empire: A History of American Expansionism'' (2009) ch 3, quoted on page 73.</ref>\n\n==== Annexation====\nMore controversial is whether an American war goal was to permanently acquire Canadian lands (especially western Ontario), or whether it was planned to seize the area temporarily, as a bargaining chip. The American desire for Canadian land has been a staple in Canadian public opinion since the 1830s, and was much discussed among historians before 1940, but has become less popular since then. The idea was first developed by Marxist historian [[Louis M. Hacker]] and refined by diplomatic specialist Julius Pratt.<ref>Hacker (1924); Pratt (1925). Goodman (1941) refuted the idea and even Pratt gave it up. Pratt (1955)</ref> \nIn 1925, Pratt argued that Western Americans were incited to war by the prospect of seizing Canada.<ref>Julius W. Pratt,  \"Western Aims in the War of 1812.\" ''The Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1925): 36-50. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1891784 in JSTOR]</ref>  Pratt's argument supported the belief of many Canadians, especially in Ontario, where fear of American expansionism was a major political element. To this day the notion still survives among Canadians.<ref>W. Arthur Bowler, \"Propaganda in Upper Canada in the War of 1812,\" ''American Review of Canadian Studies'' (1988) 28:11\u201332; C.P. Stacey, \"The War of 1812 in Canadian History\" in Morris Zaslow and Wesley B. Turner, eds. ''The Defended Border: Upper Canada and the War of 1812'' (Toronto, 1964)</ref> \n[[File:United States 1812-05-1812-06.png|left|thumb]]\n\nIn 2010 American historian [[Alan Taylor (historian)|Alan Taylor]] examined the political dimension of the annexation issue as Congress debated whether to declare war in 1811-12. The [[Federalist party]] was strongly opposed to war and to annexation, as were the northeastern states. The majority in Congress was held by the Jeffersonian Republican party, which split on the issue. One faction wanted to permanently expel Britain and annex Canada.  [[John Randolph of Roanoke]], representing Virginia, commented, \"Agrarian greed not maritime right urges this war. We have heard but one word - like the whipporwill's one monotonous tone: Canada! Canada! Canada!\"{{sfn|Fregosi|1989|p=328}}The other faction,  based in the South, said that acquiring new territory in the north would give the northern states too much power, and opposed the incorporation into Canada of a Catholic population which it viewed as \"unfit by faith, language and illiteracy for republican citizenship.\"  The Senate held a series of debates, and twice voted on proposals to explicitly endorse annexation, neither of which passed, although the second one only failed because of a proviso stating that Canada could be returned to British rule after being annexed. War was declared with no mention of annexation although widespread support existed among the War Hawks for it. Some Southerners supported expansionism; Tennessee Senator [[Felix Grundy]] considered it essential to acquire Canada to ''preserve'' domestic political balance, arguing that annexing Canada would maintain the free state-slave state balance, which might otherwise be thrown off by the acquisition of Florida and the settlement of the southern areas of the new [[Louisiana Purchase]].<ref>{{cite book|author=John Roderick Heller|title=Democracy's Lawyer: Felix Grundy of the Old Southwest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8mM8D9RVu4C&pg=PA98|year=2010|page=98}}</ref>\n\nEven [[James Monroe]] and [[Henry Clay]], key officials in the government, expected to gain at least Upper Canada from a successful war. American commanders like General William Hull and Alexander Smythe issued proclamations to Canadians and their troops assuring them that annexations would in fact occur during the war. Smythe wrote to his troops that when they entered Canada \"You enter a country that is to become one with the United States. You will arrive among a people who are to become your fellow-citizens.\"  <ref>Alan Taylor, ''The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, & Indian Allies'' (2010) pp 137-40.</ref>\n\n====Seizing Canada as a bargaining chip====\nToday historians generally agree that an invasion and temporary seizure of Canada was the central American military strategy once the war began.  Given British control of the oceans, there was no other way to actively fight against British interests. President Madison believed that food supplies from Canada were essential to the British overseas empire in the West Indies, and that an American seizure would be an excellent bargaining chip at the peace conference. During the war, some Americans speculated that they might as well keep all of Canada. Thomas Jefferson, for example, although now out of power, argued that expulsion of British interests from nearby Canada would remove a long-term threat to American republicanism. New Zealand historian J.G.A. Stagg argues that Madison and his advisers believed that conquest of Canada would be easy and that economic coercion would force the British to come to terms by cutting off the food supply for their highly valuable West Indies sugar colonies. Furthermore, possession of Canada would be a valuable bargaining chip. Stagg suggests frontiersmen demanded the seizure of Canada not because they wanted the land (they had plenty), but because the British were thought to be arming the Indians and thereby blocking settlement of the west.<ref>Stagg (1983)</ref> As Horsman concludes, \"The idea of conquering Canada had been present since at least 1807 as a means of forcing England to change her policy at sea. The conquest of Canada was primarily a means of waging war, not a reason for starting it.\"<ref>Horsman (1962) p. 267</ref> Hickey flatly states, \"The desire to annex Canada did not bring on the war.\" <ref>Hickey (1990) p. 72.</ref> Brown (1964) concludes, \"The purpose of the Canadian expedition was to serve negotiation not to annex Canada.\"<ref>Brown p. 128.</ref> Burt, a Canadian scholar, but also a professor at an American university, agrees completely, noting that Foster, the British minister to Washington, also rejected the argument that annexation of Canada was a war goal.<ref>Burt (1940) pp 305\u201310.</ref> However, Foster also rejected the possibility of a declaration of war, despite having dinner with several of the more prominent War Hawks, so his judgement in these matters can be questioned.\n\nHowever,  historian J. C. A. Stagg states that, \"... had the War 1812 been a successful military venture, the Madison administration would have been reluctant to have returned occupied Canadian territory to the enemy.\"{{sfn| Stagg| 1983| p=4}} Other authors concur, one stating, \"Expansion was not the only American objective, and indeed not the immediate one.

The Loyalists were extremely hostile to union with the U.S., while the other settlers seem to have been uninterested and remained neutral during the war. The Canadian colonies were thinly populated and only lightly defended by the British Army, and some Americans believed that the many in Upper Canada would rise up and greet an American invading army as liberators.<ref>Fred Landon, ''Western Ontario and the American Frontier'' (1941) pp 12\u201322</ref> The combination implied an easy conquest. Once the war began retired president [[Thomas Jefferson]] warned that the British presence posed a grave threat, pointing to \"The infamous intrigues of Great Britain to destroy our government....and with the Indians to Tomahawk our women and children, prove that the cession of Canada, their fulcrum for these Machiavellian levers, must be a ''sine qua non'' at a treaty of peace. Jefferson predicted in late 1812, \"the acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us the experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and final expulsion of England from the American continent.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=James Laxer|title=Tecumseh and Brock: The War of 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQb5JI-G9bwC&pg=PA129|year=2012|page=129}}</ref>\n\nMaass argued in 2015 that the expansionist theme is a myth that goes against the \"relative consensus among experts that the primary U.S. objective was the repeal of British maritime restrictions. He argues that consensus among scholars is that The United States went to war \"because six years of economic sanctions had failed to bring Britain to the negotiating table, and threatening the Royal Navy's Canadian supply base was their last hope.\" However, he also notes that many historians continue to publish in support of expansionism as a cause, and that even those opposed to the idea continue to include caveats regarding \"possible expansionism underlying US motives\". Maass agrees that theoretically expansionism might have tempted Americans, but finds that \"leaders feared the domestic political consequences of doing so. Notably, what limited expansionism there was focused on sparsely populated western lands rather than the more populous eastern settlements [of Canada].\" <ref>Richard W. Maass, \"Difficult to Relinquish Territory Which Had Been Conquered\": Expansionism and the War of 1812,\" ''Diplomatic History'' (Jan 2015) 39#1 pp 70-97 doi: 10.1093/dh/dht132 [http://dh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/01/06/dh.dht132.short Abstract Online]</ref>\n\n==Violations of American rights==\nThe long wars between Britain and France (1793\u20131815) led to repeated complaints by the U.S. that both powers violated America's right as a neutral to trade with both sides. Furthermore, Americans complained loudly that British agents in Canada were supplying munitions to hostile [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes living in [[Territorial evolution of the United States|United States territory]].\n\nStarting in the mid-1790s the [[Royal Navy]], short of manpower, began boarding American merchant ships in order to seize American and British sailors from American vessels. Although this policy of [[impressment]] was supposed to reclaim only British subjects, the law of Britain and most countries defined nationality by birth whereas the United States allowed individuals who had been resident in America for some time to adopt American citizenship. There were, therefore, large numbers of individuals who were British by British law but American by American law. The confusion was compounded by the refusal of Jefferson and Madison to issue any official citizenship documents: their position was that all persons serving on American ships were to be regarded as US citizens and that no further evidence was required. This stance was motivated by the advice of [[Albert Gallatin]], who had calculated that half of American deep-sea merchant seamen - 9,000 men - were British subjects. Allowing the Royal Navy to reclaim these men would destroy both the US economy and the vital customs revenue of the government.<ref>Rodger, Command of the Ocean, p565</ref> Any sort of accommodation would jeopardize these men, and so concords such as the proposed [[Monroe-Pinkney Treaty]] (1806) between the U.S. and Britain were rejected by Jefferson.\n\nTo fill the need for some sort of identification, US consuls provided unofficial papers. However, these relied on unverifiable declarations by the individual concerned for evidence of citizenship, and the large fees paid for the documents made them a lucrative sideline. In turn, British officers- short of personnel and convinced, not entirely unreasonably, that the US flag covered a large number of British deserters- tended to treat such papers with scorn. Between 1806 and 1812 about 6,000 seamen were impressed and taken against their will into the Royal Navy<ref>Hickey (1989) p. 11</ref> of which 3,800 were subsequently released.<ref>Rodger, Command of the Ocean, p566</ref>\n\n==Honor==\nHistorian Norman Risjord has emphasized the central importance of honor as a cause the war.<ref>Norman K. Risjord, \"1812: Conservatives, War Hawks and the Nation's Honor.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly: A Magazine of Early American History'' (1961): 196-210. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1918543 in JSTOR]</ref>  Americans of every political stripe saw the need to uphold national honor, and to reject  the treatment of the United States by Britain as a third class nonentity. Americans talked incessantly about the need for force in response.<ref>Robert L. Ivie, \"The metaphor of force in prowar discourse: The case of 1812.\" ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 68#3 (1982) pp: 240-253.</ref> This quest for honor was a major cause of the war in the sense that most Americans who were not involved in mercantile interests or threatened by Indian attack strongly endorsed the preservation of national honor.<ref>Bradford Perkins, ''The causes of the War of 1812: National honor or national interest?'' (1962).</ref> [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard Affair|The humiliating attack]] by HMS ''Leopard'' against USS ''Chesapeake'' in June 1807 was a decisive event.<ref>Spencer Tucker and Frank T. Reuter, ''Injured Honor: The Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, June 22, 1807'' (Naval Institute Press, 1996)</ref> Many Americans called for war, but Jefferson held back, insisting that economic warfare would prove more successful.  Jefferson initiated economic warfare, especially in the form of embargoing or refusing to sell products to Britain.  It proved a failure, that did not deter the British but it seriously damaged American industry had alienated the mercantile cities of the Northeast that were so seriously hurt.  Historians have demonstrated the motive power of honor in shaping public opinion in a number of states, including Massachusetts,<ref>William Barlow and David O. Powell. \"Congressman Ezekiel Bacon of Massachusetts and the Coming of the War of 1812.\" ''Historical Journal of Massachusetts'' 6#2 (1978): 28.</ref> Ohio,<ref>William R.

Calhoun]] called for a declaration of war in ringing phrases, denouncing Britain's \"lust for power,\" \"unbounded tyranny,\" and \"mad ambition.\" James Roark says, \"These were fighting words in a war that was in large measure about insult and honor.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=James L.

Historian Lance Banning says: \n:National honor, the reputation of republican government, and the continuing supremacy of the Republican party had seemed to be at stake.... National honor had [now] been satisfied....Americans celebrated the end of the struggle with a brilliant burst of national pride.  They felt that they had fought a second war for independence, and had won. If little had been gained, nothing had been lost in a contest the greatest imperial power on the earth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lance Banning|title=The Jeffersonian Persuasion: Evolution of a Party Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YL-HcJj1MO0C&pg=PA295|year=1980|publisher=Cornell UP|page=295}}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear whether the British acknowledged American honor, because when peace was signed, impressment remained legal. Nevertheless, the practice ended because the Napoleonic wars had ended and the Royal Navy no longer required as many men.\n\n==American economic motivations==\nThe failure of Jefferson's embargo and Madison's economic coercion, according to Horsman, \"made war or absolute submission to England the only alternatives, and the latter presented more terrors to the recent colonists. The war hawks came from the West and the South, regions that had supported economic warfare and were suffering the most from British restrictions at sea. The merchants of New England earned large profits from the wartime carrying trade, in spite of the numerous captures by both France and England, but the western and southern farmers, who looked longingly at the export market, were suffering a depression that made them demand war\".<ref>Horsman (1962) p. 266</ref>\n\n==Incidents leading up to the war==\nThis dispute came to the forefront with the [[Chesapeake-Leopard Affair]] of 1807, when the British warship HMS ''Leopard'' fired on and boarded the American warship USS ''Chesapeake'', killing three and carrying off four deserters from the [[Royal Navy]]. (Only one was a British citizen and he was subsequently hanged; the other three were American citizens and were later returned, though the last two not until 1812.) The American public was outraged by the incident, and many called for war in order to assert American sovereignty and national honor.\n\nThe Chesapeake-Leopard Affair followed closely on the similar [[HMS Leander (1780)#The Leander Affair|''Leander'' Affair]], which had resulted in President Jefferson banning certain British warships and their captains from American ports and waters. Whether in response to this incident or the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, President Jefferson banned all foreign armed vessels from American waters, except those bearing dispatches. In December 1808, an American officer expelled the schooner [[HMS Pitt (1805)|HMS ''Sandwich'']] from Savannah, Georgia, after she had entered with dispatches for the British Consul there.\n\nMeanwhile, Napoleon's [[Continental System]] (beginning 1806) and the British [[Orders in Council (1807)]] established embargoes that made international trade precarious. From 1807 to 1812, about 900 American ships were seized as a result.<ref>Hickey (1989) p. 19</ref> The U.S. responded with the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], which prohibited American ships from sailing to any foreign ports and closed American ports to British ships. Jefferson's embargo was especially unpopular in [[New England]], where merchants preferred the indignities of impressment to the halting of overseas commerce. This discontent contributed to the calling of the [[Hartford Convention]] in 1814.\n\nThe Embargo Act had no effect on Great Britain and France and was replaced by the [[Non-Intercourse Act|Non-Intercourse Act of 1809]], which lifted all embargoes on American shipping except for those bound for British or French ports. As this proved to be unenforceable, the Non-Intercourse Act was replaced in 1810 by [[Macon's Bill Number 2]]. This lifted all embargoes but offered that if either France or Great Britain were to cease their interference with American shipping, the United States would reinstate an embargo on the other nation. Napoleon, seeing an opportunity to make trouble for Great Britain, promised to leave American ships alone, and the United States reinstated the embargo with Great Britain and moved closer to declaring war.<ref>Napoleon had no intention of honoring promise: Hickey, p. 22; Horsman, p. 188.</ref>\n\nExacerbating the situation, [[Sauk people|Sauk]] Indians who controlled trade on the Upper Mississippi were displeased with the U.S. Government after the 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]]. This treaty ceded Sauk territory in Illinois and Missouri to the U.S.; the Sauk felt this treaty was unjust, that Quashquame was unauthorized to sign away land, and that he was unaware of what he was signing. The establishment of [[Fort Madison]] in 1808 on the Mississippi further aggravated the Sauk, and led many, including [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]], to side with the British before the war broke out. Sauk and allied Indians, including the [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago), were very effective fighters for the British on the Mississippi, helping to defeat Fort Madison and Fort McKay in [[Prairie du Chien]].\n\nOxford historian Paul Langford looks at the decisions by the British government in 1812: \n:The British ambassador in Washington [Erskine] brought affairs almost to an accommodation, and was ultimately disappointed not by American intransigence but by one of the outstanding diplomatic blunders made by a Foreign Secretary. It was [[George Canning|Canning]] who, in his most irresponsible manner and apparently out of sheer dislike of everything American, recalled the ambassador [[David Erskine, 2nd Baron Erskine|Erskine]] and wrecked the negotiations, a piece of most gratuitous folly. As a result, the possibility of a new embarrassment for Napoleon turned into the certainty of a much more serious one for his enemy. Though the British cabinet eventually made the necessary concessions on the score of the [[Orders in Council (1807)|Orders-in-Council]], in response to the pressures of industrial lobbying at home, its action came too late\u2026. The loss of the North American markets could have been a decisive blow. As it was by the time the United States declared war, the [[Continental System]] [of Napoleon] was beginning to crack, and the danger correspondingly diminishing.  Even so, the war, inconclusive though it proved in a military sense, was an irksome and expensive embarrassment which British statesman could have done much more to avert.<ref>Paul Langford, ''Modern British Foreign Policy: The Eighteenth Century: 1688-1815'' (1976) p 228</ref>\n\n==Declaration of war==\nIn the [[United States House of Representatives]], a group of young [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republicans]] known as the \"[[War Hawk]]s\" came to the forefront in 1811, led by [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]] of [[Kentucky]] and [[John C. Calhoun]] of [[South Carolina]]. The War Hawks advocated going to war against Great Britain for all of the reasons listed above, though concentrating on the grievances more than the territorial expansion.\n\nOn the first of June 1812, President [[James Madison]] gave a speech to the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], recounting American grievances against Great Britain, though not specifically calling for a declaration of war. After Madison's speech, the House of Representatives quickly voted (79 to 49) to declare war, and the Senate by 19 to 13. The conflict formally began on  18 June 1812 when Madison signed the measure into law. This was the first time that the United States had declared war on another nation, and the Congressional vote would prove to be the closest vote to declare war in American history. None of the 39 [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]]s in Congress voted in favor of the war; critics of war subsequently referred to it as \"Mr. Madison's War.\"\n<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj005181)) Journal of the Senate of the United States of America, 1789\u20131873]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chronology of the War of 1812]]\n* [[Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States|Opposition to the War of 1812]]\n* [[Results of the War of 1812]]\n* [[War of 1812]]\n* [[War of 1812 bibliography]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Adams, Henry.

Some historians maintain that an American goal in the war was annex some or all of Canada, a view that many Canadians still share, while others argue that inducing the fear of such a seizure had merely been a U.S. tactic designed to obtain a bargaining chip.<ref name=\"Bowler, pp. 11-32\">Bowler, pp. 11\u201332</ref>  Some members of the British Parliament at the time<ref name=\"Canning\">[[George Canning]],  [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1813/feb/18/address-respecting-the-war-with-america#S1V0024P0_18130218_HOC_15  Address respecting the war with America], ''[[Hansard]]'' (House of Commons), 18 February 1813</ref> and dissident American politicians such as [[John Randolph of Roanoke]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Fregosi|first=Paul|title=Dreams of Empire|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1989|isbn=0-09-173926-8|page=328}}</ref> claimed that land hunger rather than maritime disputes was the main motivation for the American declaration.

During the course of the war, both the Americans and British launched invasions of each other's territory, all of which were unsuccessful or gained only temporary success. At the end of the war, the British held parts of [[Battle of Hampden|Maine]] and some outposts in the sparsely populated West while the Americans held Canadian territory near Detroit, but these occupied territories were restored at the end of the war.\n\nIn the United States, battles such as [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]] and [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]] (the latter of which inspired the lyrics of the U.S. national anthem, [[The Star-Spangled Banner]]) produced a sense of euphoria over a \"second war of independence\" against Britain. It ushered in an \"[[Era of Good Feelings]]\", in which the partisan animosity that had once verged on treason practically vanished. Canada also emerged from the war with a heightened sense of national feeling and solidarity. Britain, which had regarded the war as a sideshow to the [[Napoleonic Wars]] raging in Europe, was less affected by the fighting; its government and people subsequently welcomed an era of peaceful relations with the United States.\n\n==British goals==\nThe British were engaged in a  life-and-death war with [[Napoleon]] and could not allow the Americans to help the enemy, regardless of their lawful neutral rights to do so. As Horsman explains, \"If possible, England wished to avoid war with America, but not to the extent of allowing her to hinder the British war effort against France. Moreover...a large section of influential British opinion, both in the government and in the country, thought that America presented a threat to British maritime supremacy.\" <ref>Horsman (1962) p. 264</ref>\n\n===Defeating Napoleon===\nThe British had two goals: All parties were committed to the defeat of France, and this required sailors (hence the need for impressment), and it required all-out commercial war against France (hence the restrictions imposed on American merchant ships). On the question of trade with America the British parties split. As Horsman argues, \"Some restrictions on neutral commerce were essential for England in this period. That this restriction took such an extreme form after 1807 stemmed not only from the effort to defeat Napoleon, but also from the undoubted jealousy of America's commercial prosperity that existed in England. America was unfortunate in that for most of the period from 1803 to 1812 political power in England was held by a group that was pledged not only to the defeat of France, but also to a rigid maintenance of Britain's commercial supremacy.\"<ref name=\"Horsman 1962 p. 265\">Horsman (1962) p. 265</ref> That group was weakened by Whigs friendly to the U.S. in mid-1812 and the policies were reversed, but too late for the U.S. had already declared war. By 1815 Britain was no longer controlled by politicians dedicated to commercial supremacy, so that cause had vanished.\n\nThe British were hindered by weak diplomats in Washington (such as [[David Erskine, 2nd Baron Erskine|David Erskine]]) who misrepresented British policy and by communications that were so slow the Americans did not learn of the reversal of policy until they had declared war.\n\nWhen Americans proposed a truce based on British ending impressment, Britain refused, because it needed those sailors. Horsman explains, \"Impressment, which was the main point of contention between England and America from 1803 to 1807, was made necessary primarily because of England's great shortage of seamen for the war against Napoleon. In a similar manner the restrictions on American commerce imposed by England's Orders in Council, which were the supreme cause of complaint between 1807 and 1812, were one part of a vast commercial struggle being waged between England and France.\" <ref name=\"Horsman 1962 p. 265\"/>\n\n===Creating an Indian barrier state between U.S. and Canada===\nThe British also had the long-standing goal of creating an [[Indian barrier state]], a large \"neutral\" Indian state that would cover most of the [[Old Northwest]] and be a barrier between the western parts of the United States and Canada. It would be independent of the United States and under the tutelage of the British, who would use it to block American expansion and to build up their control of the fur trade.<ref>Dwight L. Smith\"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea.\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 61#2-4 (1989): 46-63.</ref>  They made the demand as late as 1814 at the peace conference, but dropped the demand. Their position had been weakened by the collapse of [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]] after the [[Battle of the Thames]], but the British also simply no longer considered the goal worth conflict with the United States. Much of the proposed buffer state remained largely under British and Indian control throughout the war.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Francis M.

First, a series of trade restrictions called the Orders in Council (1807) introduced by Britain to impede American trade with [[First French Empire|France]], a country with which Britain was at war; the U.S. contested these restrictions as illegal under international law.<ref name=\"Caffery, pp.56-58\"/> Second, the [[impressment]] (forced recruitment) of U.S. citizens into the [[Royal Navy]]. Third, the alleged British military support for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] who were offering armed resistance to the United States.<ref name=\"Caffery, pp.101-104\"/>  An unstated but powerful motivation for the Americans was the need to uphold national honor in the face of British insults (such as the ''Chesapeake'' affair.)<ref name=\"in JSTOR\"/> There also may have been an American desire to annex      Canada.\n\n===British support for Indian raids===\nIndians based in the [[Northwest Territory]], comprising the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, had organized in opposition to American settlement, and were being supplied with weapons by British traders in Canada.  Britain was not trying to provoke a war, and at one point cut its allocations of gunpowder to the tribes, but it was trying to build up its fur trade and friendly relations with potential military allies.<ref>Mark Zuehlke, ''For Honour's Sake: The War of 1812 and the Brokering of an Uneasy Peace'' (2006) pp 62\u201362</ref> Although Britain had ceded the area to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, it had the long-term goal of creating a \"neutral\" or buffer Indian state in the area that would block further American growth.<ref>Dwight L. Smith, \"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea\", ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly''  (1989) 61 (2\u20134): 46\u201363.</ref>  The Indian nations generally followed [[Tenskwatawa]] (the Shawnee Prophet and the brother of [[Tecumseh]]), who since 1805 had preached his vision of purifying his society by expelling the \"Children of the Evil Spirit\" (the American settlers).<ref>Timothy D. Willig. ''Restoring the Chain of Friendship: British Policy and the Indians of the Great Lakes, 1783\u20131815'' (2008) p. 207.</ref>\n\nPratt says:\n\n<blockquote>There is ample proof that the British authorities did all in their power to hold or win the allegiance of the Indians of the Northwest with the expectation of using them as allies in the event of war. Indian allegiance could be held only by gifts, and to an Indian no gift was as acceptable as a lethal weapon. Guns and ammunition, tomahawks and scalping knives were dealt out with some liberality by British agents.<ref>Julius W. Pratt, ''A history of United States foreign-policy'' (1955) p 126</ref>\nRaiding grew more common in 1810 and 1811; Westerners in Congress found the raids intolerable and wanted them permanently ended.<ref>David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, eds. ''Encyclopedia of the War of 1812'' (1997) pp. 253, 504</ref><ref>Zuehlke, ''For Honour's Sake,'' p 62</ref></blockquote>\n\n===American expansionism===\nHistorians have considered the idea that American expansionism was one cause of the war. The American expansion into the Northwest\u2014Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin\u2014was being blocked by Indians and that was a major cause animating the Westerners.  American historian Walter Nugent in his history of  American expansionism argues that expansion into the Midwest \"was not the only American objective, and indeed not the immediate one area but it was an objective.\"<ref>Walter Nugent, ''Habits of Empire: A History of American Expansionism'' (2009) ch 3, quoted on page 73.</ref>\n\n==== Annexation====\nMore controversial is whether an American war goal was to permanently acquire Canadian lands (especially western Ontario), or whether it was planned to seize the area temporarily, as a bargaining chip. The American desire for Canadian land has been a staple in Canadian public opinion since the 1830s, and was much discussed among historians before 1940, but has become less popular since then. The idea was first developed by Marxist historian [[Louis M. Hacker]] and refined by diplomatic specialist Julius Pratt.<ref>Hacker (1924); Pratt (1925). Goodman (1941) refuted the idea and even Pratt gave it up. Pratt (1955)</ref> \nIn 1925, Pratt argued that Western Americans were incited to war by the prospect of seizing Canada.<ref>Julius W. Pratt,  \"Western Aims in the War of 1812.\" ''The Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1925): 36-50. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1891784 in JSTOR]</ref>  Pratt's argument supported the belief of many Canadians, especially in Ontario, where fear of American expansionism was a major political element. To this day the notion still survives among Canadians.<ref>W. Arthur Bowler, \"Propaganda in Upper Canada in the War of 1812,\" ''American Review of Canadian Studies'' (1988) 28:11\u201332; C.P. Stacey, \"The War of 1812 in Canadian History\" in Morris Zaslow and Wesley B. Turner, eds. ''The Defended Border: Upper Canada and the War of 1812'' (Toronto, 1964)</ref> \n[[File:United States 1812-05-1812-06.png|left|thumb]]\n\nIn 2010 American historian [[Alan Taylor (historian)|Alan Taylor]] examined the political dimension of the annexation issue as Congress debated whether to declare war in 1811-12. The [[Federalist party]] was strongly opposed to war and to annexation, as were the northeastern states. The majority in Congress was held by the Jeffersonian Republican party, which split on the issue. One faction wanted to permanently expel Britain and annex Canada.  [[John Randolph of Roanoke]], representing Virginia, commented, \"Agrarian greed not maritime right urges this war. We have heard but one word - like the whipporwill's one monotonous tone: Canada! Canada! Canada!\"{{sfn|Fregosi|1989|p=328}}The other faction,  based in the South, said that acquiring new territory in the north would give the northern states too much power, and opposed the incorporation into Canada of a Catholic population which it viewed as \"unfit by faith, language and illiteracy for republican citizenship.\"  The Senate held a series of debates, and twice voted on proposals to explicitly endorse annexation, neither of which passed, although the second one only failed because of a proviso stating that Canada could be returned to British rule after being annexed. War was declared with no mention of annexation although widespread support existed among the War Hawks for it. Some Southerners supported expansionism; Tennessee Senator [[Felix Grundy]] considered it essential to acquire Canada to ''preserve'' domestic political balance, arguing that annexing Canada would maintain the free state-slave state balance, which might otherwise be thrown off by the acquisition of Florida and the settlement of the southern areas of the new [[Louisiana Purchase]].<ref>{{cite book|author=John Roderick Heller|title=Democracy's Lawyer: Felix Grundy of the Old Southwest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8mM8D9RVu4C&pg=PA98|year=2010|page=98}}</ref>\n\nEven [[James Monroe]] and [[Henry Clay]], key officials in the government, expected to gain at least Upper Canada from a successful war. American commanders like General William Hull and Alexander Smythe issued proclamations to Canadians and their troops assuring them that annexations would in fact occur during the war. Smythe wrote to his troops that when they entered Canada \"You enter a country that is to become one with the United States. You will arrive among a people who are to become your fellow-citizens.\"  <ref>Alan Taylor, ''The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, & Indian Allies'' (2010) pp 137-40.</ref>\n\n====Seizing Canada as a bargaining chip====\nToday historians generally agree that an invasion and temporary seizure of Canada was the central American military strategy once the war began.  Given British control of the oceans, there was no other way to actively fight against British interests. President Madison believed that food supplies from Canada were essential to the British overseas empire in the West Indies, and that an American seizure would be an excellent bargaining chip at the peace conference. During the war, some Americans speculated that they might as well keep all of Canada. Thomas Jefferson, for example, although now out of power, argued that expulsion of British interests from nearby Canada would remove a long-term threat to American republicanism. New Zealand historian J.G.A. Stagg argues that Madison and his advisers believed that conquest of Canada would be easy and that economic coercion would force the British to come to terms by cutting off the food supply for their highly valuable West Indies sugar colonies. Furthermore, possession of Canada would be a valuable bargaining chip. Stagg suggests frontiersmen demanded the seizure of Canada not because they wanted the land (they had plenty), but because the British were thought to be arming the Indians and thereby blocking settlement of the west.<ref>Stagg (1983)</ref> As Horsman concludes, \"The idea of conquering Canada had been present since at least 1807 as a means of forcing England to change her policy at sea. The conquest of Canada was primarily a means of waging war, not a reason for starting it.\"<ref>Horsman (1962) p. 267</ref> Hickey flatly states, \"The desire to annex Canada did not bring on the war.\" <ref>Hickey (1990) p. 72.</ref> Brown (1964) concludes, \"The purpose of the Canadian expedition was to serve negotiation not to annex Canada.\"<ref>Brown p. 128.</ref> Burt, a Canadian scholar, but also a professor at an American university, agrees completely, noting that Foster, the British minister to Washington, also rejected the argument that annexation of Canada was a war goal.<ref>Burt (1940) pp 305\u201310.</ref> However, Foster also rejected the possibility of a declaration of war, despite having dinner with several of the more prominent War Hawks, so his judgement in these matters can be questioned.\n\nHowever,  historian J. C. A. Stagg states that, \"... had the War 1812 been a successful military venture, the Madison administration would have been reluctant to have returned occupied Canadian territory to the enemy.\"{{sfn| Stagg| 1983| p=4}} Other authors concur, one stating, \"Expansion was not the only American objective, and indeed not the immediate one. But it was an objective\",{{sfn|Nugent|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_zDQlAp4T4wC&lpg=PA75&vq=The%20American%20yearning&pg=PA75#v=snippet&q=Expansion%20was%20not%20the%20only%20American%20objective&f=false 73]}} and that \"The American yearning to absorb Canada was long-standing...In 1812 it became part of a grand strategy.\"{{sfn|Nugent|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_zDQlAp4T4wC&lpg=PA90&vq=War%20of%201812&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q=%22The%20American%20yearning%22&f=false 75]}} Another suggests that \"Americans harbored '[[manifest destiny]]' ideas of Canadian annexation throughout the nineteenth century.\"{{sfn|Carlisle|Golson|2007|p=44}} A third states that \"[t]he [American] belief that the United States would one day annex Canada had a continuous existence from the early days of the War of Independence to the War of 1812 [and] was a factor of primary importance in bringing on the war.\"{{sfn|Pratt|1925|p={{page needed|date=June 2013}} }} Another says that \"acquiring Canada would satisfy America's expansionist desires\" .<ref>David Heidler,Jeanne T. Heidler, The War of 1812, pg4 {{full citation needed|date=June 2013}} <!--needs a date--></ref> Historian Spencer Tucker tells us that \"War Hawks were eager to wage war with the British, not only to end Indian depredations in the Midwest but also to seize Canada and perhaps Spanish Florida.\"{{sfn|Tucker|2011|p=236}}\n\n===Inhabitants of Ontario===\nThe majority of the inhabitants of [[Upper Canada]] (Ontario) were Americans, some of them exiled ([[United Empire Loyalist]]s) and most of them recent immigrants. The Loyalists were extremely hostile to union with the U.S., while the other settlers seem to have been uninterested and remained neutral during the war. The Canadian colonies were thinly populated and only lightly defended by the British Army, and some Americans believed that the many in Upper Canada would rise up and greet an American invading army as liberators.<ref>Fred Landon, ''Western Ontario and the American Frontier'' (1941) pp 12\u201322</ref> The combination implied an easy conquest. Once the war began retired president [[Thomas Jefferson]] warned that the British presence posed a grave threat, pointing to \"The infamous intrigues of Great Britain to destroy our government....and with the Indians to Tomahawk our women and children, prove that the cession of Canada, their fulcrum for these Machiavellian levers, must be a ''sine qua non'' at a treaty of peace. Jefferson predicted in late 1812, \"the acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us the experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and final expulsion of England from the American continent.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=James Laxer|title=Tecumseh and Brock: The War of 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQb5JI-G9bwC&pg=PA129|year=2012|page=129}}</ref>\n\nMaass argued in 2015 that the expansionist theme is a myth that goes against the \"relative consensus among experts that the primary U.S. objective was the repeal of British maritime restrictions. He argues that consensus among scholars is that The United States went to war \"because six years of economic sanctions had failed to bring Britain to the negotiating table, and threatening the Royal Navy's Canadian supply base was their last hope.\" However, he also notes that many historians continue to publish in support of expansionism as a cause, and that even those opposed to the idea continue to include caveats regarding \"possible expansionism underlying US motives\". Maass agrees that theoretically expansionism might have tempted Americans, but finds that \"leaders feared the domestic political consequences of doing so. Notably, what limited expansionism there was focused on sparsely populated western lands rather than the more populous eastern settlements [of Canada].\" <ref>Richard W. Maass, \"Difficult to Relinquish Territory Which Had Been Conquered\": Expansionism and the War of 1812,\" ''Diplomatic History'' (Jan 2015) 39#1 pp 70-97 doi: 10.1093/dh/dht132 [http://dh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/01/06/dh.dht132.short Abstract Online]</ref>\n\n==Violations of American rights==\nThe long wars between Britain and France (1793\u20131815) led to repeated complaints by the U.S. that both powers violated America's right as a neutral to trade with both sides. Furthermore, Americans complained loudly that British agents in Canada were supplying munitions to hostile [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes living in [[Territorial evolution of the United States|United States territory]].\n\nStarting in the mid-1790s the [[Royal Navy]], short of manpower, began boarding American merchant ships in order to seize American and British sailors from American vessels. Although this policy of [[impressment]] was supposed to reclaim only British subjects, the law of Britain and most countries defined nationality by birth whereas the United States allowed individuals who had been resident in America for some time to adopt American citizenship. There were, therefore, large numbers of individuals who were British by British law but American by American law. The confusion was compounded by the refusal of Jefferson and Madison to issue any official citizenship documents: their position was that all persons serving on American ships were to be regarded as US citizens and that no further evidence was required. This stance was motivated by the advice of [[Albert Gallatin]], who had calculated that half of American deep-sea merchant seamen - 9,000 men - were British subjects. Allowing the Royal Navy to reclaim these men would destroy both the US economy and the vital customs revenue of the government.<ref>Rodger, Command of the Ocean, p565</ref> Any sort of accommodation would jeopardize these men, and so concords such as the proposed [[Monroe-Pinkney Treaty]] (1806) between the U.S. and Britain were rejected by Jefferson.\n\nTo fill the need for some sort of identification, US consuls provided unofficial papers. However, these relied on unverifiable declarations by the individual concerned for evidence of citizenship, and the large fees paid for the documents made them a lucrative sideline. In turn, British officers- short of personnel and convinced, not entirely unreasonably, that the US flag covered a large number of British deserters- tended to treat such papers with scorn. Between 1806 and 1812 about 6,000 seamen were impressed and taken against their will into the Royal Navy<ref>Hickey (1989) p. 11</ref> of which 3,800 were subsequently released.<ref>Rodger, Command of the Ocean, p566</ref>\n\n==Honor==\nHistorian Norman Risjord has emphasized the central importance of honor as a cause the war.<ref>Norman K. Risjord, \"1812: Conservatives, War Hawks and the Nation's Honor.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly: A Magazine of Early American History'' (1961): 196-210. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1918543 in JSTOR]</ref>  Americans of every political stripe saw the need to uphold national honor, and to reject  the treatment of the United States by Britain as a third class nonentity. Americans talked incessantly about the need for force in response.<ref>Robert L. Ivie, \"The metaphor of force in prowar discourse: The case of 1812.\" ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 68#3 (1982) pp: 240-253.</ref> This quest for honor was a major cause of the war in the sense that most Americans who were not involved in mercantile interests or threatened by Indian attack strongly endorsed the preservation of national honor.<ref>Bradford Perkins, ''The causes of the War of 1812: National honor or national interest?'' (1962).</ref> [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard Affair|The humiliating attack]] by HMS ''Leopard'' against USS ''Chesapeake'' in June 1807 was a decisive event.<ref>Spencer Tucker and Frank T. Reuter, ''Injured Honor: The Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, June 22, 1807'' (Naval Institute Press, 1996)</ref> Many Americans called for war, but Jefferson held back, insisting that economic warfare would prove more successful.  Jefferson initiated economic warfare, especially in the form of embargoing or refusing to sell products to Britain.  It proved a failure, that did not deter the British but it seriously damaged American industry had alienated the mercantile cities of the Northeast that were so seriously hurt.  Historians have demonstrated the motive power of honor in shaping public opinion in a number of states, including Massachusetts,<ref>William Barlow and David O.

Calhoun]] called for a declaration of war in ringing phrases, denouncing Britain's \"lust for power,\" \"unbounded tyranny,\" and \"mad ambition.\" James Roark says, \"These were fighting words in a war that was in large measure about insult and honor.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=James L. Roark|author2=Patricia Cline Cohen|title=Understanding the American Promise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMlH-LpGRTYC&pg=PA259|year=2011|page=259|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  Calhoun reaped much of the credit.<ref>{{cite book|author=James H.

Historian Lance Banning says: \n:National honor, the reputation of republican government, and the continuing supremacy of the Republican party had seemed to be at stake.... National honor had [now] been satisfied....Americans celebrated the end of the struggle with a brilliant burst of national pride.  They felt that they had fought a second war for independence, and had won. If little had been gained, nothing had been lost in a contest the greatest imperial power on the earth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lance Banning|title=The Jeffersonian Persuasion: Evolution of a Party Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YL-HcJj1MO0C&pg=PA295|year=1980|publisher=Cornell UP|page=295}}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear whether the British acknowledged American honor, because when peace was signed, impressment remained legal. Nevertheless, the practice ended because the Napoleonic wars had ended and the Royal Navy no longer required as many men.\n\n==American economic motivations==\nThe failure of Jefferson's embargo and Madison's economic coercion, according to Horsman, \"made war or absolute submission to England the only alternatives, and the latter presented more terrors to the recent colonists. The war hawks came from the West and the South, regions that had supported economic warfare and were suffering the most from British restrictions at sea. The merchants of New England earned large profits from the wartime carrying trade, in spite of the numerous captures by both France and England, but the western and southern farmers, who looked longingly at the export market, were suffering a depression that made them demand war\".<ref>Horsman (1962) p. 266</ref>\n\n==Incidents leading up to the war==\nThis dispute came to the forefront with the [[Chesapeake-Leopard Affair]] of 1807, when the British warship HMS ''Leopard'' fired on and boarded the American warship USS ''Chesapeake'', killing three and carrying off four deserters from the [[Royal Navy]]. (Only one was a British citizen and he was subsequently hanged; the other three were American citizens and were later returned, though the last two not until 1812.) The American public was outraged by the incident, and many called for war in order to assert American sovereignty and national honor.\n\nThe Chesapeake-Leopard Affair followed closely on the similar [[HMS Leander (1780)#The Leander Affair|''Leander'' Affair]], which had resulted in President Jefferson banning certain British warships and their captains from American ports and waters. Whether in response to this incident or the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, President Jefferson banned all foreign armed vessels from American waters, except those bearing dispatches. In December 1808, an American officer expelled the schooner [[HMS Pitt (1805)|HMS ''Sandwich'']] from Savannah, Georgia, after she had entered with dispatches for the British Consul there.\n\nMeanwhile, Napoleon's [[Continental System]] (beginning 1806) and the British [[Orders in Council (1807)]] established embargoes that made international trade precarious. From 1807 to 1812, about 900 American ships were seized as a result.<ref>Hickey (1989) p. 19</ref> The U.S. responded with the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], which prohibited American ships from sailing to any foreign ports and closed American ports to British ships. Jefferson's embargo was especially unpopular in [[New England]], where merchants preferred the indignities of impressment to the halting of overseas commerce. This discontent contributed to the calling of the [[Hartford Convention]] in 1814.\n\nThe Embargo Act had no effect on Great Britain and France and was replaced by the [[Non-Intercourse Act|Non-Intercourse Act of 1809]], which lifted all embargoes on American shipping except for those bound for British or French ports. As this proved to be unenforceable, the Non-Intercourse Act was replaced in 1810 by [[Macon's Bill Number 2]]. This lifted all embargoes but offered that if either France or Great Britain were to cease their interference with American shipping, the United States would reinstate an embargo on the other nation. Napoleon, seeing an opportunity to make trouble for Great Britain, promised to leave American ships alone, and the United States reinstated the embargo with Great Britain and moved closer to declaring war.<ref>Napoleon had no intention of honoring promise: Hickey, p. 22; Horsman, p. 188.</ref>\n\nExacerbating the situation, [[Sauk people|Sauk]] Indians who controlled trade on the Upper Mississippi were displeased with the U.S. Government after the 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]]. This treaty ceded Sauk territory in Illinois and Missouri to the U.S.; the Sauk felt this treaty was unjust, that Quashquame was unauthorized to sign away land, and that he was unaware of what he was signing. The establishment of [[Fort Madison]] in 1808 on the Mississippi further aggravated the Sauk, and led many, including [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]], to side with the British before the war broke out. Sauk and allied Indians, including the [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago), were very effective fighters for the British on the Mississippi, helping to defeat Fort Madison and Fort McKay in [[Prairie du Chien]].\n\nOxford historian Paul Langford looks at the decisions by the British government in 1812: \n:The British ambassador in Washington [Erskine] brought affairs almost to an accommodation, and was ultimately disappointed not by American intransigence but by one of the outstanding diplomatic blunders made by a Foreign Secretary. It was [[George Canning|Canning]] who, in his most irresponsible manner and apparently out of sheer dislike of everything American, recalled the ambassador [[David Erskine, 2nd Baron Erskine|Erskine]] and wrecked the negotiations, a piece of most gratuitous folly. As a result, the possibility of a new embarrassment for Napoleon turned into the certainty of a much more serious one for his enemy. Though the British cabinet eventually made the necessary concessions on the score of the [[Orders in Council (1807)|Orders-in-Council]], in response to the pressures of industrial lobbying at home, its action came too late\u2026. The loss of the North American markets could have been a decisive blow. As it was by the time the United States declared war, the [[Continental System]] [of Napoleon] was beginning to crack, and the danger correspondingly diminishing.  Even so, the war, inconclusive though it proved in a military sense, was an irksome and expensive embarrassment which British statesman could have done much more to avert.<ref>Paul Langford, ''Modern British Foreign Policy: The Eighteenth Century: 1688-1815'' (1976) p 228</ref>\n\n==Declaration of war==\nIn the [[United States House of Representatives]], a group of young [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republicans]] known as the \"[[War Hawk]]s\" came to the forefront in 1811, led by [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]] of [[Kentucky]] and [[John C. Calhoun]] of [[South Carolina]]. The War Hawks advocated going to war against Great Britain for all of the reasons listed above, though concentrating on the grievances more than the territorial expansion.\n\nOn the first of June 1812, President [[James Madison]] gave a speech to the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], recounting American grievances against Great Britain, though not specifically calling for a declaration of war. After Madison's speech, the House of Representatives quickly voted (79 to 49) to declare war, and the Senate by 19 to 13. The conflict formally began on  18 June 1812 when Madison signed the measure into law. This was the first time that the United States had declared war on another nation, and the Congressional vote would prove to be the closest vote to declare war in American history. None of the 39 [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]]s in Congress voted in favor of the war; critics of war subsequently referred to it as \"Mr. Madison's War.\"\n<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj005181)) Journal of the Senate of the United States of America, 1789\u20131873]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chronology of the War of 1812]]\n* [[Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States|Opposition to the War of 1812]]\n* [[Results of the War of 1812]]\n* [[War of 1812]]\n* [[War of 1812 bibliography]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Adams, Henry.

The first known teacher of sign language was Dorcas Mitchell, who taught the children of one family in Charteris Bay, [[Lyttelton Harbour]], from 1868 to 1877. By 1877 she had taught 42 pupils.\n\nWhen the first school for the deaf (then called the Sumner [[Deaf-mute|Deaf and Dumb]] Institution) was opened at Sumner, south east of Christchurch in 1878, Mitchell applied unsuccessfully for the position of principal. Instead it went to Gerrit Van Asch, who agreed with the Milan congress of deaf educators of 1880 (to which no deaf people were invited) that teaching should be oral only, and that sign language should be forbidden. (He would not even admit pupils who could sign, so only 14 were admitted.) This was the policy of the school until 1979. A [[documentary film]] about the school made in the 1950s makes no mention of sign language. Similar policies were maintained at the schools at Titirangi and Kelston that opened in 1940 and 1958.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the children used sign language secretly and after leaving school, developing NZSL out of British Sign Language largely without adult intervention for over 100 years. The main haven for NZSL was the Deaf Clubs in the main centres. In 1979, \"Total Communication\" (a \"use anything that works\" philosophy) was adopted at the Sumner School, but the signing it used was \"Australasian Sign Language\" an artificial [[signed English|signed form of English]]. As a result, younger signers use a number of Australasian signs in their NZSL, to such an extent that some call traditional NZSL \"Old Sign\". NZSL was adopted for teaching in 1994.\n\nIn 1985, Marianne Ahlgren proved in her [[PhD]] [[thesis]] at [[Victoria University of Wellington]] that NZSL is a fully-fledged\nlanguage, with a large vocabulary of signs and a consistent grammar of space.\n\nThe New Zealand Sign Language Teachers Association (NZSLTA - formerly known as the New Zealand Sign Language Tutors Association) was set up in 1992. Over the next few years [[adult education]] classes in NZSL began in several centres. In 1997 a Certificate in Deaf Studies programme was started at Victoria University of Wellington, with instruction actually in NZSL, designed to teach deaf people how to competently teach NZSL to the wider public. Also in 1992 an interpreter training programme was established at the Auckland Institute of Technology, now known as [[Auckland University of Technology]]. This programme was first directed and taught by Dr Rachel Locker McKee (hearing) and Dr David McKee (deaf) and came about due to lobbying by the New Zealand Deaf Community and others who recognised the need for safer and more professional interpreting services.  They had as early as 1984 sought support for more research to determine the need for sign language interpreters.<ref>Dugdale, Patricia (2001). Talking Hands, Listening Eyes. Deaf Association of New Zealand</ref> Other than a one-off course run in 1985, this was the first time a professional training programme with a qualification was offered in New Zealand. Many of those who have gone on to work as professional NZSL interpreters began their journey in NZSL community classes taught by members of the NZSLTA.\n\nAn important step toward the recognition of NZSL was the publication in 1998 of a comprehensive NZSL [[dictionary]] by Victoria University of Wellington and the Deaf Association of NZ. It contains some 4000 signs (which correspond to many more meanings than the same number of English words, because of the way signs can be modulated in space and time), sorted by handshape, not English meaning, and coded in the Hamburg Notational System, [[HamNoSys]], as well as pictorially.  In 2011, Victoria University launched an Online Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nzsl.vuw.ac.nz/|title=The Online Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language - NZSL Online|website=nzsl.vuw.ac.nz|accessdate=8 May 2017}}</ref> based on the original 1998 work, which includes video clips of each sign with examples and the ability to search for signs based on features of the sign (handshape, location, etc.) as well as the sign's English gloss.\n\nFor some years, [[TVNZ]] broadcast a weekly news programme, \"News Review\", interpreted in NZSL. This was discontinued in 1993 after a joint survey of deaf and [[Hearing impairment|hearing-impaired]] people found a majority favoured captioned programmes. Many Deaf people felt they had been misled by the survey. There has been no regular programming in NZSL since.\n\nBetween August 2012 to August 2013 the Human Rights Commission carried out an inquiry into the use and promotion of New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL). The inquiry has focused on working with key government agencies and the Deaf community around the inquiry's three terms of reference 1) The right to education for deaf people and potential users of NZSL. 2) The rights of deaf people, and other potential users of NZSL, to access communication, information and services, and the right to freedom of expression and opinion, through the provision of professional NZSL interpreter services and other NZSL services and resources. 3) The promotion and maintenance of NZSL as an official language of New Zealand. The full report of the inquiry, ''A New Era in the Right to Sign'', was launched in Parliament by the Minister for Disability Issues, Tariana Turia, on 3 September 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrc.co.nz/files/8014/2356/7275/A-New-Era-in-the-Right-to-Sign-for-web.pdf|title=A New Era in the Right to Sign|website=www.hrc.co.nz|accessdate=10 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Official language status==\nNZSL became the third [[Languages of New Zealand|official language of New Zealand]] on 11 April 2006, joining English and M\u0101ori.

However, in light of much research into its validity as a language and much advocacy by deaf adults, parents of deaf children (both hearing and deaf) and educationalists, NZSL has since become \u2014 in tandem with English \u2014 part of the bilingual/bicultural approach used in public schools (including [[Kelston Deaf Education Centre]] and [[Van Asch Deaf Education Centre]]) since 1994.

Article Begins Here -->\n\nThe '''Clydesdale''' is a [[horse breed|breed]] of [[draught horse]] named for and derived from the farm horses of [[Clydesdale]], a county in [[Scotland]]. Although originally one of the smaller breeds of draught horses, it is now a tall breed. Often [[bay (horse)|bay]] in colour, they show significant [[horse markings|white markings]] due to the presence of [[sabino horse|sabino genetics]]. The breed was originally used for agriculture and haulage, and is still used for draught purposes today. The [[Budweiser Clydesdales]] are some of the most famous Clydesdales, and other members of the breed are used as drum horses by the British [[Household Cavalry]]. They have also been used to create and improve other breeds.\n\nThe breed was developed from [[Flemish]] stallions imported to Scotland and crossed with local mares. The first recorded use of the name \"Clydesdale\" for the breed was in 1826, and by 1830, a system of hiring stallions had begun that resulted in the spread of Clydesdale horses throughout Scotland and into northern England. The first [[breed registry]] was formed in 1877. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, thousands of Clydesdales were exported from Scotland and sent throughout the world, including to Australia and New Zealand, where they became known as \"the breed that built Australia\". \n\nDuring [[World War I]], population numbers began to decline due to increasing mechanisation and war conscription. This decline continued, and by the 1970s, the [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] considered the breed vulnerable to extinction. Population numbers have increased slightly in the intervening period, but they are still thought to be vulnerable.\n\n==Breed characteristics==\nThe [[equine conformation|conformation]] of the Clydesdale has changed greatly throughout its history. In the 1920s and 1930s, it was a compact horse smaller than the [[Shire horse|Shire]], [[Percheron]], and [[Belgian horse|Belgian]]. Beginning in the 1940s, breeding animals were [[selective breeding|selected]] to produce taller horses that looked more impressive in parades and shows. Today, the Clydesdale stands {{162cm|to|183cm}} high and weighs {{convert|1800|to|2000|lbs|kg}}.<ref name=Dutson>Dutson, pp. 348\u2013351</ref> Some mature males are larger, standing taller than 183 cm and weighing up to {{convert|2200|lbs|kg}}.

Breed associations pay close attention to the quality of the [[hoof|hooves]] and legs, as well as the general [[horse gaits|movement]]. Their gaits are active, with clearly lifted hooves and a general impression of power and quality.<ref name=Dutson/> Clydesdales are energetic, with a manner described by the Clydesdale Horse Society as a \"gaiety of carriage and outlook\".<ref name=Society/> \n\nClydesdales have been identified to be at risk for [[chronic progressive lymphedema]], a disease with clinical signs that include progressive swelling, [[hyperkeratosis]], and [[fibrosis]] of [[distal]] limbs that is similar to [[lymphedema|chronic lymphedema]] in humans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/elephantitis/about.html|title=Chronic Progressive Lymphedema (CPL) in Draft Horses|publisher=University of California, Davis|accessdate=2010-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203045010/http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/elephantitis/about.html|archive-date=February 3, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Another health concern is a skin condition on the lower leg where feathering is heavy. Colloquially called \"Clyde's itch\", it is thought to be caused by a type of [[mange]]. Clydesdales are also known to develop sunburn on any pink (unpigmented) skin around their faces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clydesdalehorse.com.au/faq.html|title=Archived copy|access-date=April 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807192321/http://www.clydesdalehorse.com.au/faq.html|archive-date=August 7, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nClydesdales are usually [[bay (horse)|bay]] in colour, but a [[roan (horse)|roaning]] pattern, [[black (horse)|black]], [[gray (horse)|grey]], and [[Chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] also occur. Most have [[horse markings|white markings]], including white on the face, feet, and legs, and occasional body spotting (generally on the lower belly).  They also have extensive [[feathering (horse)|feathering]] on their lower legs.<ref name=Dutson/>  Roaning, body spotting, and extensive white markings are thought to be the result of sabino genetics. Some Clydesdale breeders want white face and leg markings without the spotting on the body.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.apha.com/breed/geneticeq/geneticeq4|title=Sabino spotting|publisher=American Paint Horse Association|accessdate=2013-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831172736/http://www.apha.com/breed/geneticeq/geneticeq4|archive-date=August 31, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTo attempt getting the ideal set of markings, they often breed horses with only one white leg to horses with four white legs and sabino roaning on their bodies. On average, the result is a foal with the desired amount of white markings.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Clydesdales do not have the Sabino 1 (''SB1'') gene responsible for causing sabino expressions in many other breeds, and researchers theorise that several other genes are responsible for these patterns.<ref name=brooks2005>{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=Samantha |author2=Ernest Bailey |year=2005 |title=Exon skipping in the KIT gene causes a sabino spotting pattern in horses |journal=Mammalian Genome |volume=16 |pages=893\u2013902 |doi=10.1007/s00335-005-2472-y |pmid=16284805 |issue=11}}</ref> \n\nMany buyers pay a premium for bay and black horses, especially those with four white legs and white facial markings. Specific colours are often preferred over other physical traits, and some buyers even choose horses with [[Lameness (equine)|soundness problems]] if they have the desired colour and markings. Roan horses are not preferred by buyers, despite one draught-breed writer theorizing that they are needed to keep the desired coat colours and texture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.drafthorsejournal.com/read/autumn2009/stable-talk?tmpl=component&print=1 |title=Stable Talk |author=Roy, Bruce |date=August 16, 2010 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |work=The Draft Horse Journal |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224172906/https://www.drafthorsejournal.com/read/autumn2009/stable-talk?tmpl=component&print=1 |archivedate=December 24, 2012 }}</ref> Breed associations, however, state that no colour is bad, and that horses with roaning and body spots are increasingly accepted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clydesdalehorsesociety.com/the-modern-clydesdale.html|title=The Modern Clydesdale|publisher=Clydesdale Horse Society|accessdate=2011-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203110700/http://clydesdalehorsesociety.com/the-modern-clydesdale.html|archive-date=February 3, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Clydesdale wagon.jpg|thumb|Two New Zealand Clydesdales pulling a wagon]]\nThe Clydesdale takes its name from [[Clydesdale]], the old name for [[Lanarkshire]], noted for the [[River Clyde]].<ref name=IMH>{{cite web|url=http://imh.org/exhibits/online/clydesdale |title=Clydesdale|publisher=International Museum of the Horse|accessdate=2013-09-04}}</ref> In the mid-18th century, [[Flemish]] [[stallion]]s were imported to Scotland and bred to local [[mare]]s, resulting in [[foal]]s that were larger than the existing local stock. These included a [[black (horse)|black]] unnamed stallion imported from England by a John Paterson of Lochlyloch and an unnamed [[bay (horse)|dark-brown]] stallion owned by the [[James Douglas-Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]].<ref name=Society/>\n\nAnother prominent stallion was a {{hands|16.1}} [[driving (horse)|coach horse]] stallion of unknown lineage named Blaze.

Article Begins Here -->\n\nThe '''Clydesdale''' is a [[horse breed|breed]] of [[draft horse]] named for and derived from the farm horses of [[Clydesdale]], a county in [[Scotland]]. Although originally one of the smaller breeds of draught horses, it is now a tall breed. Often [[bay (horse)|bay]] in colour, they show significant [[horse markings|white markings]] due to the presence of [[sabino horse|sabino genetics]]. The breed was originally used for agriculture and haulage, and is still used for draught purposes today. The [[Budweiser Clydesdales]] are some of the most famous Clydesdales, and other members of the breed are used as drum horses by the British [[Household Cavalry]]. They have also been used to create and improve other breeds.\n\nThe breed was developed from [[Flemish]] stallions imported to Scotland and crossed with local mares. The first recorded use of the name \"Clydesdale\" for the breed was in 1826, and by 1830, a system of hiring stallions had begun that resulted in the spread of Clydesdale horses throughout Scotland and into northern England. The first [[breed registry]] was formed in 1877. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, thousands of Clydesdales were exported from Scotland and sent throughout the world, including to Australia and New Zealand, where they became known as \"the breed that built Australia\". \n\nDuring [[World War I]], population numbers began to decline due to increasing mechanization and war conscription. This decline continued, and by the 1970s, the [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] considered the breed vulnerable to extinction. Population numbers have increased slightly in the intervening time, but they are still thought to be vulnerable.\n\n==Breed characteristics==\nThe [[equine conformation|conformation]] of the Clydesdale has changed greatly throughout its history. In the 1920s and 1930s, it was a compact horse smaller than the [[Shire horse|Shire]], [[Percheron]], and [[Belgian horse|Belgian]]. Beginning in the 1940s, breeding animals were [[selective breeding|selected]] to produce taller horses that looked more impressive in parades and shows. Today, the Clydesdale stands {{162cm|to|183cm}} high and weighs {{convert|1800|to|2000|lbs|kg}}.<ref name=Dutson>Dutson, pp. 348\u2013351</ref> Some mature males are larger, standing taller than 183 cm and weighing up to {{convert|2200|lbs|kg}}.

Breed associations pay close attention to the quality of the [[hoof|hooves]] and legs, as well as the general [[horse gaits|movement]]. Their gaits are active, with clearly lifted hooves and a general impression of power and quality.<ref name=Dutson/> Clydesdales are energetic, with a manner described by the Clydesdale Horse Society as a \"gaiety of carriage and outlook\".<ref name=Society/> \n\nClydesdales have been identified to be at risk for [[chronic progressive lymphedema]], a disease with clinical signs that include progressive swelling, [[hyperkeratosis]], and [[fibrosis]] of [[distal]] limbs that is similar to [[lymphedema|chronic lymphedema]] in humans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/elephantitis/about.html|title=Chronic Progressive Lymphedema (CPL) in Draft Horses|publisher=University of California, Davis|accessdate=2010-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203045010/http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/elephantitis/about.html|archive-date=February 3, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Another health concern is a skin condition on the lower leg where feathering is heavy.

They also have extensive [[feathering (horse)|feathering]] on their lower legs.<ref name=Dutson/>  Roaning, body spotting, and extensive white markings are thought to be the result of sabino genetics.

On average, the result is a foal with the desired amount of white markings.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Clydesdales do not have the Sabino 1 (''SB1'') gene responsible for causing sabino expressions in many other breeds, and researchers theorise that several other genes are responsible for these patterns.<ref name=brooks2005>{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=Samantha |author2=Ernest Bailey |year=2005 |title=Exon skipping in the KIT gene causes a sabino spotting pattern in horses |journal=Mammalian Genome |volume=16 |pages=893\u2013902 |doi=10.1007/s00335-005-2472-y |pmid=16284805 |issue=11}}</ref> \n\nMany buyers pay a premium for bay and black horses, especially those with four white legs and white facial markings.

The '''Darboux integral''' exists if and only if the upper and lower integrals are equal.  The upper and lower integrals are in turn the infimum and supremum, respectively, of '''upper and lower (Darboux) sums''' which over- and underestimate, respectively, the \"area under the curve.\" In particular, for a given partition of the interval of integration, the upper and lower sums add together the areas of rectangular slices whose heights are the supremum and infimum, respectively, of ''f'' in each subinterval of the partition.  These ideas are made precise below:\n\n===Darboux sums===\nA [[partition of an interval]] [''a'',''b''] is a finite sequence of values ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> such that\n\n:<math>a = x_0 < x_1 < \\cdots < x_n = b . \\,\\!</math>\n\nEach interval [''x''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>,''x''<sub>''i''</sub>] is called a ''subinterval'' of the partition.

Furthermore, the lower Darboux sum is bounded below by the rectangle of width ''(b-a)'' and height ''inf(f)'' taken over [''a'',''b'']. Likewise, the upper sum is bounded above by the rectangle of width ''(b-a)'' and height ''sup(f)''.\n::<math>(b-a)\\inf_{x \\in [a,b]} f(x) \\leqslant L_{f,P} \\leqslant U_{f,P} \\leqslant (b-a)\\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} f(x)</math>\n\n*The lower and upper Darboux integrals satisfy\n::<math>\\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx  \\leqslant \\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx </math>\n\n*Given any ''c'' in (''a'',''b'')\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n\\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx  &= \\underline{\\int_{a}^{c}} f(x) \\, dx + \\underline{\\int_{c}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx\\\\[6pt]\n\\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx  &= \\overline{\\int_{a}^{c}} f(x) \\, dx + \\overline{\\int_{c}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n*The lower and upper Darboux integrals are not necessarily linear. Suppose that ''g'':[''a'',''b'']\u2192\u211d is also a bounded function, then the upper and lower integrals satisfy the following inequalities.\n\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n\\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx + \\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} g(x) \\, dx &\\leqslant \\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} (f(x) + g(x)) \\, dx\\\\[6pt]\n \\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx +  \\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} g(x) \\, dx &\\geqslant  \\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} (f(x) + g(x)) \\, dx \n\\end{align}</math>\n\n*For a constant ''c'' \u2265 0 we have\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n\\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} cf(x) &= c\\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x)\\\\[6pt]\n\\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} cf(x) &= c\\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n*For a constant ''c'' \u2264 0 we have\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n\\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} cf(x) &= c\\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x)\\\\[6pt]\n\\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} cf(x) &= c\\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n*Consider the function:\n::<math>\\begin{cases} F : [a, b] \\to \\R \\\\ F(x) = \\underline{\\int_{a}^{x}} f(t) \\, dt \\end{cases}</math>\n:then ''F'' is [[Lipschitz continuous]]. An identical result holds if ''F'' is defined using an upper Darboux integral.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===A Darboux-integrable function===\nSuppose we want to show that the function ''f(x) = x'' is Darboux-integrable on the interval [0,1] and determine its value. To do this we partition [0,1] into ''n'' equally sized subintervals each of length ''1/n''. We denote a partition of ''n'' equally sized subintervals as ''P''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nNow since ''f(x) = x'' is strictly increasing on [0,1], the infimum on any particular subinterval is given by its starting point. Likewise the supremum on any particular subinterval is given by its end point. The starting point of the ''k''th subinterval in ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> is ''(k-1)/n'' and the end point is ''k/n''. Thus the lower Darboux sum on a partition ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> is given by\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nL_{f,P_n} &= \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} f(x_{k-1})(x_{k} - x_{k-1})\\\\\n         &= \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} \\frac{k-1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n}\\\\\n         &= \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} [k-1]\\\\ \n         &= \\frac{1}{n^2}\\left[ \\frac{(n-1)n}{2} \\right]\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nsimilarly, the upper Darboux sum is given by\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nU_{f,P_n} &= \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} f(x_{k})(x_{k} - x_{k-1})\\\\\n         &= \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} \\frac{k}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n}\\\\\n         &= \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} k\\\\ \n         &= \\frac{1}{n^2}\\left[ \\frac{(n+1)n}{2} \\right]\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSince\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nU_{f,P_n} - L_{f,P_n} &= \\frac{1}{n}\n\\end{align}</math>\nThus for given any ''\u03b5 > 0'', we have that any partition ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> with ''n > 1/\u03b5'' satisfies \n:<math>\\begin{align}\nU_{f,P_n} - L_{f,P_n} &< \\epsilon\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhich shows that ''f'' is Darboux integrable. To find the value of the integral note that\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\int_{0}^{1}f(x) \\, dx &= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} U_{f,P_n} =\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} L_{f,P_n}  = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{align}</math>\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 300\n<!-- Extra parameters -->\n| header = Darboux sums\n| header_align = center\n| header_background =\n| footer =\n| footer_align =\n| footer_background =\n| background color =\n\n|image1=Riemann Integration and Darboux Upper Sums.gif\n|width1=300\n|caption1=<div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Darboux upper sums of the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}</div>\n|alt1=Upper Darboux sum example\n\n|image2=Riemann Integration and Darboux Lower Sums.gif\n|width2=300\n|caption2=<div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Darboux lower sums of the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}</div>\n|alt2=Lower Darboux sum example\n}}\n\n===An unintegrable function===\nSuppose we have the function ''f'':[0,1]\u2192\u211d defined as \n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nf(x) &=\n \\begin{cases}\n 0, & \\text{if }x\\text{ is rational} \\\\\n 1, & \\text{if }x\\text{ is irrational}\n \\end{cases}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSince the rational and irrational numbers are both [[dense subset]]s of \u211d, it follows that ''f'' takes on the value of 0 and 1 on every subinterval of any partition. Thus for any partition ''P'' we have\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nL_{f,P} &=\\sum_{k = 1}^{n}(x_{k} - x_{k-1})\\inf_{x \\in [x_{k-1},x_{k}]}f = 0\\\\\nU_{f,P} &=\\sum_{k = 1}^{n}(x_{k} - x_{k-1}) \\sup_{x \\in [x_{k-1},x_{k}]}f = 1\n\\end{align}</math>\nfrom which we can see that the lower and upper Darboux integrals are unequal.\n\n==Refinement of a partition and relation to Riemann integration==\n[[Image:Darboux refinement.svg|250px|thumb|right|When passing to a refinement, the lower sum increases and the upper sum decreases.]]\nA ''refinement'' of the partition\n\n:<math>x_0,\\ldots,x_n  \\,\\!</math>\n\nis a partition\n\n:<math>y_0, \\ldots, y_m \\,\\!</math>\n\nsuch that for every ''i'' with\n\n:<math>0 \\le i \\le n \\,\\!</math>\n\nthere is an integer ''r''(''i'') such that\n\n:<math> x_{i} = y_{r(i)} . \\,\\!</math>\n\nIn other words, to make a refinement, cut the subintervals into smaller pieces and do not remove any existing cuts.

The '''Darboux integral''' exists if and only if the upper and lower integrals are equal.  The upper and lower integrals are in turn the infimum and supremum, respectively, of '''upper and lower (Darboux) sums''' which over- and underestimate, respectively, the \"area under the curve.\" In particular, for a given partition of the interval of integration, the upper and lower sums add together the areas of rectangular slices whose heights are the supremum and infimum, respectively, of ''f'' in each subinterval of the partition.  These ideas are made precise below:\n\n===Darboux sums===\nA [[partition of an interval]] [''a'',''b''] is a finite sequence of values ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> such that\n\n:<math>a = x_0 < x_1 < \\cdots < x_n = b . \\,\\!</math>\n\nEach interval [''x''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>,''x''<sub>''i''</sub>] is called a ''subinterval'' of the partition.  Let \u0192:[''a'',''b'']\u2192\u211d be a bounded function, and let\n\n:<math>P = (x_0, \\ldots, x_n) \\,\\!</math>\n\nbe a partition of [''a'',''b''].  Let\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n M_i = \\sup_{x\\in[x_{i-1},x_{i}]} f(x) , \\\\\n m_i = \\inf_{x\\in[x_{i-1},x_{i}]} f(x) .\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n[[Image:Darboux.svg|thumb|right|Lower (green) and upper (green plus lavender) Darboux sums for four subintervals]]\n\nThe '''upper Darboux sum''' of \u0192 with respect to ''P'' is\n\n:<math>U_{f, P} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i}-x_{i-1}) M_i . \\,\\!</math>\n\nThe '''lower Darboux sum''' of \u0192 with respect to ''P'' is\n\n:<math>L_{f, P} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i}-x_{i-1}) m_i . \\,\\!</math>\n\nThe lower and upper Darboux sums are often called the lower and upper sums.\n\n===Darboux integrals===\nThe '''upper Darboux integral''' of \u0192 is\n\n:<math>U_f = \\inf\\{U_{f,P} \\colon P \\text{ is a partition of } [a,b]\\} . \\,\\!</math>\n\nThe '''lower Darboux integral''' of \u0192 is\n\n:<math>L_f = \\sup\\{L_{f,P} \\colon P \\text{ is a partition of } [a,b]\\} . \\,\\!</math>\n\nIn some literature an integral symbol with an underline and overline represent the lower and upper Darboux integrals respectively.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nL_f \\equiv \\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x &\\quad U_f \\equiv \\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAnd like Darboux sums they are sometimes simply called the lower and upper integrals.\n\nIf ''U''<sub>\u0192</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''L''<sub>\u0192</sub>, then we call the common value the '''Darboux Integral'''.<ref>Wolfram MathWorld</ref> We also say that \u0192 is ''Darboux-integrable'' or simply ''integrable'' and set\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b {f(t)\\,dt} = U_f = L_f , \\,\\!</math>\n\nAn equivalent and sometimes useful criterion for the integrability of ''f'' is to show that for every ''\u03b5 > 0'' there exists a partition ''P''<sub>''\u03b5''</sub> on  [''a'',''b''] such that<ref>Spivak 2008, chapter 13.</ref>\n\n:<math> U_{f,P_\\epsilon} - L_{f,P_\\epsilon} < \\epsilon </math>\n\n==Properties==\n*For any given partition, the upper Darboux sum is always greater than or equal to the lower Darboux sum. Furthermore, the lower Darboux sum is bounded below by the rectangle of width ''(b-a)'' and height ''inf(f)'' taken over [''a'',''b'']. Likewise, the upper sum is bounded above by the rectangle of width ''(b-a)'' and height ''sup(f)''.\n::<math>(b-a)\\inf_{x \\in [a,b]} f(x) \\leqslant L_{f,P} \\leqslant U_{f,P} \\leqslant (b-a)\\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} f(x)</math>\n\n*The lower and upper Darboux integrals satisfy\n::<math>\\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx  \\leqslant \\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx </math>\n\n*Given any ''c'' in (''a'',''b'')\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n\\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx  &= \\underline{\\int_{a}^{c}} f(x) \\, dx + \\underline{\\int_{c}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx\\\\[6pt]\n\\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx  &= \\overline{\\int_{a}^{c}} f(x) \\, dx + \\overline{\\int_{c}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n*The lower and upper Darboux integrals are not necessarily linear. Suppose that ''g'':[''a'',''b'']\u2192\u211d is also a bounded function, then the upper and lower integrals satisfy the following inequalities.\n\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n\\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx + \\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} g(x) \\, dx &\\leqslant \\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} (f(x) + g(x)) \\, dx\\\\[6pt]\n \\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x) \\, dx +  \\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} g(x) \\, dx &\\geqslant  \\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} (f(x) + g(x)) \\, dx \n\\end{align}</math>\n\n*For a constant ''c'' \u2265 0 we have\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n\\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} cf(x) &= c\\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x)\\\\[6pt]\n\\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} cf(x) &= c\\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n*For a constant ''c'' \u2264 0 we have\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n\\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} cf(x) &= c\\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x)\\\\[6pt]\n\\overline{\\int_{a}^{b}} cf(x) &= c\\underline{\\int_{a}^{b}} f(x)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n*Consider the function:\n::<math>\\begin{cases} F : [a, b] \\to \\R \\\\ F(x) = \\underline{\\int_{a}^{x}} f(t) \\, dt \\end{cases}</math>\n:then ''F'' is [[Lipschitz continuous]]. An identical result holds if ''F'' is defined using an upper Darboux integral.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===A Darboux-integrable function===\nSuppose we want to show that the function ''f(x) = x'' is Darboux-integrable on the interval [0,1] and determine its value. To do this we partition [0,1] into ''n'' equally sized subintervals each of length ''1/n''. We denote a partition of ''n'' equally sized subintervals as ''P''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nNow since ''f(x) = x'' is strictly increasing on [0,1], the infimum on any particular subinterval is given by its starting point. Likewise the supremum on any particular subinterval is given by its end point. The starting point of the ''k''th subinterval in ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> is ''(k-1)/n'' and the end point is ''k/n''. Thus the lower Darboux sum on a partition ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> is given by\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nL_{f,P_n} &= \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} f(x_{k-1})(x_{k} - x_{k-1})\\\\\n         &= \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} \\frac{k-1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n}\\\\\n         &= \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} [k-1]\\\\ \n         &= \\frac{1}{n^2}\\left[ \\frac{(n-1)n}{2} \\right]\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nsimilarly, the upper Darboux sum is given by\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nU_{f,P_n} &= \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} f(x_{k})(x_{k} - x_{k-1})\\\\\n         &= \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} \\frac{k}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n}\\\\\n         &= \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} k\\\\ \n         &= \\frac{1}{n^2}\\left[ \\frac{(n+1)n}{2} \\right]\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSince\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nU_{f,P_n} - L_{f,P_n} &= \\frac{1}{n}\n\\end{align}</math>\nThus for given any ''\u03b5 > 0'', we have that any partition ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> with ''n > 1/\u03b5'' satisfies \n:<math>\\begin{align}\nU_{f,P_n} - L_{f,P_n} &< \\epsilon\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhich shows that ''f'' is Darboux integrable. To find the value of the integral note that\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\int_{0}^{1}f(x) \\, dx &= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} U_{f,P_n} =\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} L_{f,P_n}  = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{align}</math>\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 300\n<!-- Extra parameters -->\n| header = Darboux sums\n| header_align = center\n| header_background =\n| footer =\n| footer_align =\n| footer_background =\n| background color =\n\n|image1=Riemann Integration and Darboux Upper Sums.gif\n|width1=300\n|caption1=<div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Darboux upper sums of the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}</div>\n|alt1=Upper Darboux sum example\n\n|image2=Riemann Integration and Darboux Lower Sums.gif\n|width2=300\n|caption2=<div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Darboux lower sums of the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}</div>\n|alt2=Lower Darboux sum example\n}}\n\n===An unintegrable function===\nSuppose we have the function ''f'':[0,1]\u2192\u211d defined as \n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nf(x) &=\n \\begin{cases}\n 0, & \\text{if }x\\text{ is rational} \\\\\n 1, & \\text{if }x\\text{ is irrational}\n \\end{cases}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSince the rational and irrational numbers are both [[dense subset]]s of \u211d, it follows that ''f'' takes on the value of 0 and 1 on every subinterval of any partition. Thus for any partition ''P'' we have\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nL_{f,P} &=\\sum_{k = 1}^{n}(x_{k} - x_{k-1})\\inf_{x \\in [x_{k-1},x_{k}]}f = 0\\\\\nU_{f,P} &=\\sum_{k = 1}^{n}(x_{k} - x_{k-1}) \\sup_{x \\in [x_{k-1},x_{k}]}f = 1\n\\end{align}</math>\nfrom which we can see that the lower and upper Darboux integrals are unequal.\n\n==Refinement of a partition and relation to Riemann integration==\n[[Image:Darboux refinement.svg|250px|thumb|right|When passing to a refinement, the lower sum increases and the upper sum decreases.]]\nA ''refinement'' of the partition\n\n:<math>x_0,\\ldots,x_n  \\,\\!</math>\n\nis a partition\n\n:<math>y_0, \\ldots, y_m \\,\\!</math>\n\nsuch that for every ''i'' with\n\n:<math>0 \\le i \\le n \\,\\!</math>\n\nthere is an integer ''r''(''i'') such that\n\n:<math> x_{i} = y_{r(i)} . \\,\\!</math>\n\nIn other words, to make a refinement, cut the subintervals into smaller pieces and do not remove any existing cuts.

The island is situated north of [[Den Helder]], northeast of [[Noorderhaaks]], also known as \"Razende Bol\" and southwest of [[Vlieland]].\n\n== Name ==\nThe name ''Texel'' is Frisian, but because of [[Dutch language#Classification|historical sound-changes in Dutch]], where all -x- sounds have been replaced with -s- sounds (compare for instance English ''fox'', Frisian ''fokse'', German ''Fuchs'' with Dutch ''vos''), the name is typically pronounced ''Tessel'' in Dutch.<ref>{{cite book|last=Donaldson|first=Bruce C.|year=1983|title=Dutch: A Linguistic History of Holland and Belgium|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|place=Leiden||isbn=9789024791668|page=151}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[All Saints' Flood (1170)]] created the islands of Texel and [[Wieringen]] from [[North Holland]].<ref name=\"ley196110\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=October 1961\n |title=The Home-Made Land\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v19n06_1961-08#page/n65/mode/1up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=92-106\n |type=\n}}</ref> In the 13th century [[Ada, Countess of Holland]] was held prisoner on Texel by her uncle William.\n\nTexel received [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] in 1415.\n\nTexel was involved in the [[Battle of Scheveningen]] (1653) during the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] and the [[Battle of Texel]] (1673) during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]].\n[[File:Dutch ships in the roadstead of Texel (the 'Gouden Leeuw' of Cornelis Tromp in the center)(Ludolf Backhuysen, 1671).jpg|thumb|left|Dutch ships in the [[roadstead]] of Texel, 1671]]\n[[File:The wreck of HMS Hero in the Texel, 25 December 1811.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Hero'' wrecked at Haak Sands near Texel December 25, 1811]]\nTexel is also famous in military history as the only place where a navy was defeated on horseback. Occupying Holland in January 1795, the French continental army learned that the Dutch navy had been frozen into the ice around Texel, so Commandant [[Louis Joseph Lahure]] and 128 men rode up to it and demanded surrender. No shots were fired.\n\n[[HMS Lutine]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] frigate loaded with British [[gold]], sank along the Texel coast in a storm during 1799.  Her wreck shifted in the sands; despite several  intensive, well financed  searches, only a few treasures have been found.    <ref>https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mystery-of-the-sinking-of-hms-lutine-f0279pwqn</ref> A beaker made from a silver bar is displayed in the [[National Maritime Museum]] at  Greenwich.

In that final action, [[John Paul Jones]] defeated and captured the British ship [[HMS Serapis (1779)|HMS ''Serapis'']], which he sailed to Texel for desperately needed repairs. This event further complicated Anglo-Dutch relations.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] in 1914, the [[Battle off Texel]] took place off the coast of Texel.\n\nOn the night of 31 August 1940, the sea to the northwest of Texel was the scene of the sinking of two British destroyers and the severe damage of a third by German mines in what is known as the [[Texel Disaster]].\n\nAt the end of [[Second World War]] in 1945, the [[Georgian uprising on Texel]] took place on the island.\n\n==Geography ==\n[[File:Texel-natuur-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|upright|''2014 map of Texel'']]\n\nThe municipality is located at {{coord|53|3|N|4|48|E}} north of the mainland of the province of [[North Holland]] and west of the mainland of the province of [[Friesland]]. The island of Texel is situated north of the city of [[Den Helder]], northeast of the uninhabited island of [[Noorderhaaks]], which is part of the municipality, and southwest of the island of [[Vlieland]].\n\nThe island includes the seven villages:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=12em|\n* [[De Cocksdorp]]\n* [[De Koog]]\n* [[De Waal]]\n* [[Den Burg]]\n* [[Den Hoorn, North Holland|Den Hoorn]]\n* [[Oosterend]]\n* [[Oudeschild]]\n}} and the small townships of \n{{columns-list|colwidth=12em|\n* Bargen\n* De Nes\n* Dijkmanshuizen\n* [[Driehuizen, Texel|Driehuizen]]\n* Harkebuurt\n* 't Horntje\n* Midden-Eierland\n* Molenbuurt\n* Nieuweschild\n* Noorderbuurt\n* Ongeren\n* Oost\n* Spang\n* Spijkdorp\n* Tienhoven\n* Westermient\n* Zevenhuizen\n* Zuid-Eierland\n}}\nThe island of Texel was originally made up of two islands, Texel proper to the south and [[Eierland]] to the northeast, which were connected by [[shoal]]s. In the early seventeenth century, the islands were connected by a [[Levee|dyke]] to keep the [[North Sea]] from ravaging the coastal areas of Texel proper. In the mid-nineteenth century a [[polder]] completed the northern half of the island. Today, Texel forms the largest natural barrier between the North Sea and the [[Wadden Sea]].\n\nThe dune landscape along the western coast of the island is protected as [[Dunes of Texel National Park]].\n\n=== Landscape ===\nThe dune landscape on Texel is a unique habitat for wildlife. Notable areas include [[Dunes_of_Texel_National_Park#De_Slufter|De Slufter]], where the tide comes in and meets the dunes, forming a marshy environment rich in both fauna and flora. Texel is known for its wildlife, particularly in winter, when [[bird of prey|birds of prey]] and [[goose|geese]] take up residence. About one third of Texel is a protected nature reserve. A wetland called Utopia has been designed for birds to nest in.<ref>[https://www.natuurmonumenten.nl/nieuws/utopia-voor-vogels Utopia voor vogels]</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Slufter2.jpg|The [[Dunes of Texel National Park]]\nFile:Texel Landscape.jpg|Texel Landscape\nFile:De Koog - Koogerstrand - View NorthWest.jpg|De Koog - Koogerstrand - View Northwest\nFile:Dunes on Texel.jpg|Dunes on Texel\nFile:Beach_Texel_Netherlands.jpg|Beach on the island of Texel\nFile:Duinen van Texel5.jpg|Duinen van Texel\nFile:Ecomare - De Slufter 2014 (slufter-excursie2014-6495-sw).jpg|Nature and environment excursion in De Slufter\nFile:Nederland - Texel - panoramio.jpg|Texel\n</gallery>\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box\n|location = Texel\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan record high C = 13.7\n| Feb record high C = 14.9\n| Mar record high C = 20.5\n| Apr record high C = 27.9\n| May record high C = 31.0\n| Jun record high C = 31.7\n| Jul record high C = 34.6\n| Aug record high C = 33.8\n| Sep record high C = 32.6\n| Oct record high C = 24.8\n| Nov record high C = 17.7\n| Dec record high C = 15.3\n|year record high C = \n|Jan high C = 5.5\n|Feb high C = 5.5\n|Mar high C = 8.3\n|Apr high C = 11.7\n|May high C = 15.4\n|Jun high C = 18\n|Jul high C = 20.3\n|Aug high C = 20.6\n|Sep high C = 17.9\n|Oct high C = 14\n|Nov high C = 9.7\n|Dec high C = 6.4\n|Jan low C = 1.2\n|Feb low C = 0.8\n|Mar low C = 2.8\n|Apr low C = 5\n|May low C = 8.6\n|Jun low C = 11.3\n|Jul low C = 13.8\n|Aug low C = 14\n|Sep low C = 11.7\n|Oct low C = 8.5\n|Nov low C = 4.9\n|Dec low C = 2\n| Jan record low C = -18.8\n| Feb record low C = -18.5\n| Mar record low C = -14.5\n| Apr record low C = -4.8\n| May record low C = -2.1\n| Jun record low C = 1.5\n| Jul record low C = 5.2\n| Aug record low C = 5.6\n| Sep record low C = 3.0\n| Oct record low C = -4.6\n| Nov record low C = -10.8\n| Dec record low C = -12.3\n|year record low C = \n|Jan precipitation mm = 66.2\n|Feb precipitation mm = 44.4\n|Mar precipitation mm = 52.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 33.7\n|May precipitation mm = 45\n|Jun precipitation mm = 54.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 59.8\n|Aug precipitation mm = 76.8\n|Sep precipitation mm = 83.7\n|Oct precipitation mm = 95.9\n|Nov precipitation mm = 83.5\n|Dec precipitation mm = 69.8\n|year precipitation mm = \n|Jan sun = 64.1\n|Feb sun = 91.1\n|Mar sun = 134.8\n|Apr sun = 194.2\n|May sun = 235.2\n|Jun sun = 219\n|Jul sun = 228.2\n|Aug sun = 208.2\n|Sep sun = 148\n|Oct sun = 114.2\n|Nov sun = 63.1\n|Dec sun = 51\n|year sun = |source 1 = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.klimaatatlas.nl |title=Klimaatatlas&#124; KNMI |publisher=knmi.nl |date= |accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref>\n|source 2 = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://weergegevens.nl/extremes_mon.aspx?station=235&extreem=X_TX&order=1&maand=1&country=3 |title=www.weergegevens.nl|date= |accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref>\n|date=March 2015\n}}\n\n==Notable people ==\n[[File:Imme Dros.JPG|125px|thumb|Imme Dros, 2010]]\n[[File:Alice Blom 1.jpg|125px|thumb|Alice Blom, 2010]]\n* [[Willem Eduard Bok]] (1846 in Den Burg \u2013 1904) a Dutch-born South African [[Boer]] politician, civil servant and statesman \n* [[Willem Hendrik Keesom]] (1876 in Texel \u2013 1956) a Dutch physicist who first froze [[liquid helium]]\n* [[Sim Visser]] (1908 in Eierland \u2013 1983) a Dutch politician\n* [[Cornelis de Jager]] (born 1921 in Den Burg) a Dutch astronomer who predicts [[solar variation]]\n* [[Imme Dros]] (born 1936 in Oudeschild) a Dutch writer of children's literature\n* [[Hans Kamp]] (born 1940 in Den Burg) a Dutch philosopher and linguist, introduced [[Discourse Representation Theory]]\n* [[Rene Daalder]] (1944\u20132019) a Dutch writer and director <ref> [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0196350/  IMDb Database] retrieved 06 July 2019 </ref>\n* [[Henk Zijm]] (born 1952 in Driehuizen) a Dutch mathematician from the [[University of Twente]]\n=== Sport ===\n* [[Alice Blom]] (born 1980 in Oudeschild) a volleyball player\n* [[Dorian van Rijsselberghe]] (born 1988 in Den Burg) a sailor, gold medallist at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] and [[2016 Summer Olympics]]\n\n== Economy ==\nThe tourism industry forms a substantial part of the economy in Texel. Approximately 70% of activities on Texel are in some way related to tourism. Popular forms of tourism on Texel include cycling, walking, swimming and horse riding. Farming (sheep, potatoes, dairy, tulips, and grain) and fishing (primarily from [[Oudeschild]]) are traditional.\n\n== Local government ==\n[[File:Texel Lighthouse.JPG|thumb|[[Eierland Lighthouse]] in 2013]]\nThe municipal council of Texel consists of 15 seats, which are divided as follows (from the most recent election results in [[Dutch municipal elections, 2018|2018]]:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* Texels Belang, 4 seats\n* [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]], 3 seats\n* [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]], 2 seats\n* [[GroenLinks]], 2 seats\n* [[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]], 2 seats\n* [[Democrats 66|D66]], 1 seat\n* Texel 2010, 1 seat\n}}\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Dokter Wagemaker 3.jpg|thumb|Ferry {{Interlanguage link multi|MS Dokter Wagemaker (2)|nl|3=Dokter Wagemaker (schip, 2005)}} from Den Helder to Texel in 2005]]\n\nTransport around the island is typically by bicycle, bus (Texelhopper) or car. Texel has an extensive cycle path network. Transport to Texel is usually by ferry ([[Royal TESO]]), from [[Den Helder]], or by air via [[Texel International Airport]].

The island is situated north of [[Den Helder]], northeast of [[Noorderhaaks]], also known as \"Razende Bol\" and southwest of [[Vlieland]].\n\n== Name ==\nThe name ''Texel'' is Frisian, but because of [[Dutch language#Classification|historical sound-changes in Dutch]], where all -x- sounds have been replaced with -s- sounds (compare for instance English ''fox'', Frisian ''fokse'', German ''Fuchs'' with Dutch ''vos''), the name is typically pronounced ''Tessel'' in Dutch.<ref>{{cite book|last=Donaldson|first=Bruce C.|year=1983|title=Dutch: A Linguistic History of Holland and Belgium|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|place=Leiden||isbn=9789024791668|page=151}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[All Saints' Flood (1170)]] created the islands of Texel and [[Wieringen]] from [[North Holland]].<ref name=\"ley196110\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=October 1961\n |title=The Home-Made Land\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v19n06_1961-08#page/n65/mode/1up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=92-106\n |type=\n}}</ref> In the 13th century [[Ada, Countess of Holland]] was held prisoner on Texel by her uncle William.\n\nTexel received [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] in 1415.\n\nTexel was involved in the [[Battle of Scheveningen]] (1653) during the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] and the [[Battle of Texel]] (1673) during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]].\n[[File:Dutch ships in the roadstead of Texel (the 'Gouden Leeuw' of Cornelis Tromp in the center)(Ludolf Backhuysen, 1671).jpg|thumb|left|Dutch ships in the [[roadstead]] of Texel, 1671]]\n[[File:The wreck of HMS Hero in the Texel, 25 December 1811.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Hero'' wrecked at Haak Sands near Texel December 25, 1811]]\nTexel is also famous in military history as the only place where a navy was defeated on horseback. Occupying Holland in January 1795, the French continental army learned that the Dutch navy had been frozen into the ice around Texel, so Commandant [[Louis Joseph Lahure]] and 128 men rode up to it and demanded surrender. No shots were fired.\n\n[[HMS Lutine]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] frigate loaded with British [[gold]], sank along the Texel coast in a storm during 1799.  Her wreck shifted in the sands; despite several  intensive, well financed  searches, only a few treasures have been found.    <ref>https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mystery-of-the-sinking-of-hms-lutine-f0279pwqn</ref> A beaker made from a silver bar is displayed in the [[National Maritime Museum]] at  Greenwich.

In that final action, [[John Paul Jones]] defeated and captured the British ship [[HMS Serapis (1779)|HMS ''Serapis'']], which he sailed to Texel for desperately needed repairs. This event further complicated Anglo-Dutch relations.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] in 1914, the [[Battle off Texel]] took place off the coast of Texel.\n\nOn the night of 31 August 1940, the sea to the northwest of Texel was the scene of the sinking of two British destroyers and the severe damage of a third by German mines in what is known as the [[Texel Disaster]].\n\nAt the end of [[Second World War]] in 1945, the [[Georgian uprising on Texel]] took place on the island.\n\n==Geography ==\n[[File:Texel-natuur-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|upright|''2014 map of Texel'']]\n\nThe municipality is located at {{coord|53|3|N|4|48|E}} north of the mainland of the province of [[North Holland]] and west of the mainland of the province of [[Friesland]]. The island of Texel is situated north of the city of [[Den Helder]], northeast of the uninhabited island of [[Noorderhaaks]], which is part of the municipality, and southwest of the island of [[Vlieland]].\n\nThe island includes the seven villages:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=12em|\n* [[De Cocksdorp]]\n* [[De Koog]]\n* [[De Waal]]\n* [[Den Burg]]\n* [[Den Hoorn, North Holland|Den Hoorn]]\n* [[Oosterend]]\n* [[Oudeschild]]\n}} and the small townships of \n{{columns-list|colwidth=12em|\n* Bargen\n* De Nes\n* Dijkmanshuizen\n* [[Driehuizen, Texel|Driehuizen]]\n* Harkebuurt\n* 't Horntje\n* Midden-Eierland\n* Molenbuurt\n* Nieuweschild\n* Noorderbuurt\n* Ongeren\n* Oost\n* Spang\n* Spijkdorp\n* Tienhoven\n* Westermient\n* Zevenhuizen\n* Zuid-Eierland\n}}\nThe island of Texel was originally made up of two islands, Texel proper to the south and [[Eierland]] to the northeast, which were connected by [[shoal]]s. In the early seventeenth century, the islands were connected by a [[Levee|dyke]] to keep the [[North Sea]] from ravaging the coastal areas of Texel proper. In the mid-nineteenth century a [[polder]] completed the northern half of the island. Today, Texel forms the largest natural barrier between the North Sea and the [[Wadden Sea]].\n\nThe dune landscape along the western coast of the island is protected as [[Dunes of Texel National Park]].\n\n=== Landscape ===\nThe dune landscape on Texel is a unique habitat for wildlife. Notable areas include [[Dunes_of_Texel_National_Park#De_Slufter|De Slufter]], where the tide comes in and meets the dunes, forming a marshy environment rich in both fauna and flora. Texel is known for its wildlife, particularly in winter, when [[bird of prey|birds of prey]] and [[goose|geese]] take up residence. About one third of Texel is a protected nature reserve. A wetland called Utopia has been designed for birds to nest in.<ref>[https://www.natuurmonumenten.nl/nieuws/utopia-voor-vogels Utopia voor vogels]</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Slufter2.jpg|The [[Dunes of Texel National Park]]\nFile:Texel Landscape.jpg|Texel Landscape\nFile:De Koog - Koogerstrand - View NorthWest.jpg|De Koog - Koogerstrand - View Northwest\nFile:Dunes on Texel.jpg|Dunes on Texel\nFile:Beach_Texel_Netherlands.jpg|Beach on the island of Texel\nFile:Duinen van Texel5.jpg|Duinen van Texel\nFile:Ecomare - De Slufter 2014 (slufter-excursie2014-6495-sw).jpg|Nature and environment excursion in De Slufter\nFile:Nederland - Texel - panoramio.jpg|Texel\n</gallery>\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box\n|location = Texel\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan record high C = 13.7\n| Feb record high C = 14.9\n| Mar record high C = 20.5\n| Apr record high C = 27.9\n| May record high C = 31.0\n| Jun record high C = 31.7\n| Jul record high C = 34.6\n| Aug record high C = 33.8\n| Sep record high C = 32.6\n| Oct record high C = 24.8\n| Nov record high C = 17.7\n| Dec record high C = 15.3\n|year record high C = \n|Jan high C = 5.5\n|Feb high C = 5.5\n|Mar high C = 8.3\n|Apr high C = 11.7\n|May high C = 15.4\n|Jun high C = 18\n|Jul high C = 20.3\n|Aug high C = 20.6\n|Sep high C = 17.9\n|Oct high C = 14\n|Nov high C = 9.7\n|Dec high C = 6.4\n|Jan low C = 1.2\n|Feb low C = 0.8\n|Mar low C = 2.8\n|Apr low C = 5\n|May low C = 8.6\n|Jun low C = 11.3\n|Jul low C = 13.8\n|Aug low C = 14\n|Sep low C = 11.7\n|Oct low C = 8.5\n|Nov low C = 4.9\n|Dec low C = 2\n| Jan record low C = -18.8\n| Feb record low C = -18.5\n| Mar record low C = -14.5\n| Apr record low C = -4.8\n| May record low C = -2.1\n| Jun record low C = 1.5\n| Jul record low C = 5.2\n| Aug record low C = 5.6\n| Sep record low C = 3.0\n| Oct record low C = -4.6\n| Nov record low C = -10.8\n| Dec record low C = -12.3\n|year record low C = \n|Jan precipitation mm = 66.2\n|Feb precipitation mm = 44.4\n|Mar precipitation mm = 52.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 33.7\n|May precipitation mm = 45\n|Jun precipitation mm = 54.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 59.8\n|Aug precipitation mm = 76.8\n|Sep precipitation mm = 83.7\n|Oct precipitation mm = 95.9\n|Nov precipitation mm = 83.5\n|Dec precipitation mm = 69.8\n|year precipitation mm = \n|Jan sun = 64.1\n|Feb sun = 91.1\n|Mar sun = 134.8\n|Apr sun = 194.2\n|May sun = 235.2\n|Jun sun = 219\n|Jul sun = 228.2\n|Aug sun = 208.2\n|Sep sun = 148\n|Oct sun = 114.2\n|Nov sun = 63.1\n|Dec sun = 51\n|year sun = |source 1 = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.klimaatatlas.nl |title=Klimaatatlas&#124; KNMI |publisher=knmi.nl |date= |accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref>\n|source 2 = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://weergegevens.nl/extremes_mon.aspx?station=235&extreem=X_TX&order=1&maand=1&country=3 |title=www.weergegevens.nl|date= |accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref>\n|date=March 2015\n}}\n\n==Notable people ==\n[[File:Imme Dros.JPG|125px|thumb|Imme Dros, 2010]]\n[[File:Alice Blom 1.jpg|125px|thumb|Alice Blom, 2010]]\n* [[Willem Eduard Bok]] (1846 in Den Burg \u2013 1904) a Dutch-born South African [[Boer]] politician, civil servant and statesman \n* [[Willem Hendrik Keesom]] (1876 in Texel \u2013 Leiden) a Dutch physicist who first froze [[liquid helium]]\n* [[Sim Visser]] (1908 in Eierland \u2013 1983) a Dutch politician\n* [[Cornelis de Jager]] (born 1921 in Den Burg) a Dutch astronomer who predicts [[solar variation]]\n* [[Imme Dros]] (born 1936 in Oudeschild) a Dutch writer of children's literature\n* [[Hans Kamp]] (born 1940 in Den Burg) a Dutch philosopher and linguist, introduced [[Discourse Representation Theory]]\n* [[Rene Daalder]] (1944 - 2019) a Dutch writer and director <ref> [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0196350/  IMDb Database] retrieved 06 July 2019 </ref>\n* [[Henk Zijm]] (born 1952 in Driehuizen) a Dutch mathematician from the [[University of Twente]]\n=== Sport ===\n* [[Alice Blom]] (born 1980 in Oudeschild) a volleyball player\n* [[Dorian van Rijsselberghe]] (born 1988 in Den Burg) a sailor, gold medallist at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] and [[2016 Summer Olympics]]\n\n== Economy ==\nThe tourism industry forms a substantial part of the economy in Texel. Approximately 70% of activities on Texel are in some way related to tourism. Popular forms of tourism on Texel include cycling, walking, swimming and horse riding.

In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the ''Daily Mail'' and ''News of the World'', particularly [[Andy Coulson]], had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from [[Margaret Thatcher]] onwards had cultivated a close relationship with [[Rupert Murdoch]] and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between [[David Cameron]] and [[Rebekah Brooks]] (n\u00e9e Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: \"Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament \u2013 that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nWhen asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] to \"drag their feet\" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: \"20 percent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nGrant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of his \"turning the tables\" on a tabloid journalist.<ref name=\"Guardian-2011-04-16\" />\n\nWhilst the allegations regarding the ''News of the World'' continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared, for example, on [[BBC Radio 4]]) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered [[Millie Dowler]] had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch's [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], culminating in an appearance on [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' in July 2011.<ref name=\"guardian-2011-07-08\" />\n\nGrant said: \"It's been fascinating to have a little excursion into another world.

In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the ''Daily Mail'' and ''News of the World'', particularly [[Andy Coulson]], had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from [[Margaret Thatcher]] onwards had cultivated a close relationship with [[Rupert Murdoch]] and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between [[David Cameron]] and [[Rebekah Brooks]] (n\u00e9e Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: \"Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament \u2013 that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nWhen asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] to \"drag their feet\" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: \"20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nGrant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of his \"turning the tables\" on a tabloid journalist.<ref name=\"Guardian-2011-04-16\" />\n\nWhilst the allegations regarding the ''News of the World'' continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared, for example, on [[BBC Radio 4]]) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered [[Millie Dowler]] had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch's [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], culminating in an appearance on [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' in July 2011.<ref name=\"guardian-2011-07-08\" />\n\nGrant said: \"It's been fascinating to have a little excursion into another world.
